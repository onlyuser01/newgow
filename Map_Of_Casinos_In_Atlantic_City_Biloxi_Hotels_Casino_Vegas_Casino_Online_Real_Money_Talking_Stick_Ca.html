<p>Meridianbet will move forward as the Official Sponsor for the Football Association of Montenegro (FSCG) in a bid intended to strengthen both organizations. On the one hand, Meridianbet will be able to appeal to local audiences and raise awareness for its profile, as well as provide financial support to the country’s soccer competitions and teams.</p>
<p>FSCG Doubles Down on Meridianbet Partnership</p>
<p>On the other, the FSCG will seek to elevate the experience for fans by partnering with a trusted, respected, and locally-licensed brand. The partnership is an “elevated” opportunity for both, as the organizations are thickening their collaboration and extending it to cover the season ending in 2024. This means that Meridianbet will continue to provide local players with innovative features and experiences, including the operator’s Empty Bet solution.</p>
<p>This is the first partnership extension of the original agreement which began in 2022 and may carry on for many years to follow, depending on the two parties’ mutual understanding. Commenting on the agreement extension, FSCG president Dejan Savićević hailed the opportunity to continue working with Meridianbet, which he called an honor.</p>
<p>“We are glad that Meridianbet recognized the mutual benefits of this partnership, which we look forward to taking to even greater heights,” Savićević said, adding that the country’s soccer has benefited as a result.</p>
<p>Meridianbet executive director for Montenegro, Jovana Klisić, was similarly excited about this arrangement, and added that he was looking forward to seeing the two organizations collaborate for yet another season:</p>
<p>We are immensely honored to have the support of Meridianbet, a company with regional and international credibility. Meridianbet executive director for Montenegro, Jovana Klisić</p>
<p>Klisić said Meridianbet was glad to establish this partnership and strike mutual benefits across the board and elevate the mutual collaboration to “greater heights.” The Falcons, as the national team is known, have now gained a strong collaborator and teammate.</p>
<p>Helping to Develop Soccer in Montenegro</p>
<p>Meridianbet will now be present at official events and competitions, supporting the brand but also investing in sports facilities, youth programs, and infrastructure in the background to ensure that Montenegro continues to cultivate a top crop of soccer athletes and talent.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to contribute to the growth of Montenegrin football and to build a strong foundation for future successes together,” Klisić wrapped up.</p>
<p>Partnerships between sports bodies and betting and gaming operators are very popular although they have been coming under heavy criticism by fans and responsible gambling groups.</p>
<p>However, for the time being, Montenegro seems confident that Meridianbet is a trusted partner that is able to navigate the matter with professionalism and offer a boost to the local soccer talent pool and industry. Previously, Meridianbet has confirmed that it is committed to the UN’s Global Compact Initiative, a project that has invited businesses from all over the world to commit to sustainable models and practices.</p>
