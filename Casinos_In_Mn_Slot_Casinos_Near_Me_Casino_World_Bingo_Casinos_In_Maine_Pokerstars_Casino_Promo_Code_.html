    <h1>Casinos In Mn Slot Casinos Near Me Casino World Bingo Casinos In Maine Pokerstars Casino Promo Code</h1>

<p>Hello, I had deposited some small amounts without any problems. Then I won 350 euros and wanted to pay it out to me. They offered the same withdrawal methods as for deposits. Had deposited immediately and trustly. So I immediately chose for the payout. If they were rejected, they would have problems. 2nd try then via trustly, was also rejected. Support absolutely wanted me to pay out via skrill, otherwise I wouldn't get my money, sent me a link. But they don't offer the method at all. Back in the live chat, I said I could only pay with a credit card. Entered the data of my card 3 times, but there was always an error message. Nevertheless, the payment was on the transaction list and was then rejected. Back in live chat, I should try again later. The whole thing went 3 times. I got scared that they would rip me off and had my card blocked. Back in live chat, after a really 2 hour discussion I was told about ecopayz. So I took this method. That was 2 days ago, I know it was not long ago, but I am quite sure that I will never see this 350 euros. I'm especially in the live chat tonight, because no matter how many emails I write I get no response. In the live chat I asked how long a payout will be processed, he said in 48 hours. That was ok for me, only then the statement came again, now it would take longer because they have technical problems. Something's wrong there, I'm sure. I submitted all the documents, everything. Really got a confirmation for it and that I can now cash out. You send me an email 3 times a day, no not with an answer, but that I should submit a customer review. I have never been treated so cold in any casino. If you just ask something in the live chat that doesn't suit you, I can help you otherwise or you simply end the chat although nothing has been clarified. How do I get my money now?</p>
