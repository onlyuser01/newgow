    <h1>Great American Casino Casino Heist Fingerprints Iowa Casino Casino Royale Watch Renaissance Curacao</h1>

<p>Push Gaming has released Crystal Catcher for all operators on its network following a successful three-month exclusive deal with Kindred</p>
<p>In April, Push Gaming announced it would expand its presence in the Dutch gaming market via a new Kindred agreement. The partnership also gave the business-to-business supplier’s freshest slot, Crystal Catcher, three months’ exclusivity to all of the operator’s customers across all markets.</p>
<p>Now that the exclusivity period has expired, Push Gaming has announced the official network launch of the 7×7 game across all operator partners.</p>
<p>At the end of May, the studio launched 10 Swords, a Roman-themed slot with payouts of up to 5,000x.</p>

<p>“Immense Anticipation” Ahead of the Network Release</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s director of games, Konstantinos Vytsaras, commented on the fresh release, explaining that the game has already recorded an “amazing reception during its initial exclusivity period with Kindred”.</p>
<p>This helped it build a lot of anticipation prior to the official release for all network operators. Players who are already familiar with other iconic games from the same studio, including Retro Tapes and Jammin’ Jars, can expect to come across a handful of similar mechanics in Crystal Catcher.</p>
<p>The game incorporates six vividly colored gems representing the symbols on the large grid, along with vibrant visual elements. To form winning combinations, players need to land a minimum of five identical symbols on adjacent lines.</p>
<p>Once a winning combo is formed, the winning symbols disappear from the grid, triggering a cascade of fresh icons to fall from the top, thus creating more winning opportunities.</p>
<p>Wild Beetle and Free Spins Features</p>
<p>The game also encompasses a wild beetle symbol that helps players unlock even more wins by replacing any of the symbols in the base game. Provided a crystal symbol is also present on the reels together with a wild beetle symbol, it will move to the location of the crystal and boost the wild multiplier by 1x, automatically increasing the game’s winning potential.</p>
<p>Players can scoop up instant prizes that can reach up to 500x with the help of the same wild beetles. For even higher wins, players need to keep their eyes on a multiplier wild beetle that can be triggered during the base game or the free spins game.</p>
<p>To access the free spins round, the wild symbol needs to collect a bonus crystal that awards seven free spins. During this feature, the wild beetle will be present with its gathered multiplier that will stay active during all subsequent free spins. At the start of June, Push Gaming inked an agreement with Sky Betting and Gaming operator in the UK, strengthening its foothold in this market.</p>
