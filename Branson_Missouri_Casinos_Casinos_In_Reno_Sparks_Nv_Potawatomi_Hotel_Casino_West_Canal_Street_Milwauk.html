<p>The international gambling operator, VBET, announced a new sponsorship agreement earlier this week. The company confirmed that it has become the official sponsor of the famous soccer team, FC Dynamo Kyiv. Upon announcing the new collaboration, the operator confirmed that the sponsorship will be in effect for the 2023/2024 season. Additionally, VBET unveiled that it secured the right to priority extension of the contract after the 2024 soccer season.</p>
<p>Per the freshly minted sponsorship agreement, VBET Ukraine, the representative of the international brand VBET in the country, agreed to participate in different activations that seek to promote the popularity of soccer. Additionally, the collaboration will promote the club, while at the same time, raising awareness of the gaming and betting brand.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, the duo agreed to collaborate on activations that will involve soccer fans in the country. Additionally, VBET Ukraine and Dynamo will join forces for different media campaigns and marketing activities, bringing unique experiences for sports fans and bettors alike. According to a statement released by FC Dynamo Kyiv, VBET's logo will be seen on the kits of the soccer players starting with the upcoming game with FC Mynai planned for July 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Olexiy Palamarchuk, FC Dynamo Kyiv's Marketing Vice President, acknowledged the team's efforts to continue growing and expanding its audiences. "I am sure that cooperation with the VBET Ukraine will help in both of these directions," he said. Additionally, Palamarchuk pointed out: "Our country and our football are going through rough times, so we are grateful to everyone who supports the development of professional football in Ukraine." Finally, he once again highlighted the importance of the new sponsorship agreement with VBET Ukraine.</p>
<p>As a representative of the international gambling operator VBET, VBET Ukraine has been operating in the country since 2020. To commence its operations, VBET Ukraine secured all three necessary licenses from the country's gambling regulator, the Commission for the Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries of Ukraine. As a result, the operator secured a license for the organization and provision of poker gambling games online, a license for the organization and conduct of bookmaking, as well as a license for the provision and organization of casino games online. Securing those licenses, VBET Ukraine became the first operator in the country to hold all three.</p>
