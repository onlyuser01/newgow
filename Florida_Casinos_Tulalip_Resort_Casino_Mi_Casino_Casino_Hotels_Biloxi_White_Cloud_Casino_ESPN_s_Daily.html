    <h1>Florida Casinos Tulalip Resort Casino Mi Casino Casino Hotels Biloxi White Cloud Casino ESPN s Daily</h1>

<p>For the past three years, Daily Wager has been filmed at The LINQ Hotel + Experience studio situated on the bustling Las Vegas Strip</p>
<p>As the NFL season gears up for kick-off, ESPN’s sports betting news and information program, Daily Wager, is making a major transition back to the East Coast. The show, which initially premiered on March 11, 2019, in Bristol, Connecticut, is returning to its roots and will commence broadcasting from ESPN’s headquarters on September 7, according to an announcement made by the network.</p>
<p>Relocation of Daily Wager Show Coincides with ESPN’s Strategic Partnership</p>
<p>With the impending launch of ESPN BET, a network-branded online sportsbook, the decision has been made to relocate the Daily Wager show from the Las Vegas Strip back to Bristol. ESPN recently entered into a transformative sports betting partnership with PENN Entertainment, aiming to unveil ESPN BET sometime this fall, potentially around Thanksgiving Day, as revealed by PENN Entertainment CEO Jay Snowden during an analyst conference call.</p>
<p>This shift in focus is leading to the unwinding of ESPN’s marketing affiliations with industry giants Caesars Entertainment and DraftKings, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Linq Promenade, where Daily Wager had its Vegas home, falls under the umbrella of Caesars Entertainment and was inaugurated by the casino conglomerate back in 2013.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the change, Scott Clark, VP of ESPN’s fantasy and sports betting content, expressed gratitude for the time spent in Las Vegas, stating: “ESPN created some great content and incredible memories during our time at the Las Vegas studio. With our new ESPN BET deal set to launch this fall, we felt it was best to return to our headquarters.”</p>
<p>Clark further extended his gratitude to everyone ESPN had collaborated with at Caesars Entertainment throughout the previous years and conveyed his best wishes for their future endeavors.</p>
<p>New Schedule for Daily Wager Show Unveiled Alongside On-Air Shifts</p>
<p>Coinciding with the relocation, ESPN unveiled a fresh weekly schedule for Daily Wager. The show will air on ESPN2 from Thursday through Monday, with Tuesday and Wednesday marked as days off. Additionally, a new Saturday morning edition is being introduced at 11 AM ET to provide viewers with insights into the weekend’s football matchups.</p>
<p>This move follows ESPN laying off approximately 20 on-air personalities in July, including sports betting analyst Doug Kezirian and boxing analyst Andre Ward. These cuts, which also affected prominent figures like Jeff Van Gundy, Vince Carter, and Todd McShay, were confirmed following speculation about the reasons behind the move, including the impact of newcomer Pat McAfee and the network’s focus on managing costs during contract renewals.</p>
<p>With the NFL season’s commencement on September 7, marked by a face-off between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Detroit Lions, the network’s restructured lineup is poised to offer fans an enhanced sports betting experience. ESPN’s extensive sports coverage also includes the upcoming regular seasons of the NBA and NHL, both set to debut later this fall.</p>
