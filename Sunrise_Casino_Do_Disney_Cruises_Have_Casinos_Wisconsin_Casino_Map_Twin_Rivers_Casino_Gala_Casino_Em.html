<p>A brand new 3 Oaks Gaming title has hit the market. The distinguished distributor, which is also behind titles such as Dragon Wealth, just announced the expansion of its beloved Hold and Win series with a new fairytale-themed slot game called More Magic Apple.</p>

<p>A New Addition to the Magic Apple Series</p>
<p>As the title suggests, More Magic Apple is a sequel to the supplier’s famous Magic Apple slot game. The new title brings back familiar concepts while adding a plethora of new elements, allowing the game to stay fresh.</p>
<p>In a game of More Magic Apple, players will venture into a mythical forest. They will collect symbols of castles, magical apples and beloved fairytale characters.</p>
<p>The castle symbols serve as scatter symbols. Collecting three or more such symbols will trigger Free Spins mode. The forest will darken, the wild symbols will increase in price and the chances to win will increase as well. Collecting more castles will award extra free spins.</p>
<p>Collect Magical Apples to Win</p>
<p>Collecting magical apples can open the way to a very special bonus game where players can multiply their winnings and/or win one of four in-game jackpots. To access the bonus game, players need to collect six or more apple symbols in a single spin.</p>
<p>The title features the Hold and Win feature, which is activated during the bonus, an extra row will appear on top of the reels. The new row contains Plus, Multiplier and Gold Booster symbols that can greatly improve the prizes players earn.</p>
<p>The Plus modifier adds its value to all symbols underneath. The Multiplier, meanwhile, increases the value from its dedicated reel. Finally, the Gold Booster provides an upgrade to a Bonus symbol, making it easier to score big wins.</p>
<p>In addition, apple symbols stick to the reels during the Hold and Win game, making it easier to score winning combinations. In case a player fills all cells with apple symbols, their payout will be doubled.</p>
<p>Lucky Players Can Strike a Jackpot</p>
<p>In addition to everything else, More Magic Apple players can win one of four jackpots, ranging from a modest Mini jackpot to a Grand Jackpot of 5,000x the bet.</p>
<p>Sebastian Damian, 3 Oaks Gaming’s managing director commented on the release, saying that the new title fits perfectly into the company’s existing portfolio.</p>
<p>As ever with a Hold and Win slot, we have made significant, yet subtle, changes by adding a booster row to this title, giving players an awesome opportunity to boost winnings thanks to three different modifiers. Sebastian Damian, MD, 3 Oaks Gaming</p>
<p>3 Oaks recently expanded its team, welcoming Yuriy Muratov as CBDO and Victoria Vashukevich as head of account management.</p>
