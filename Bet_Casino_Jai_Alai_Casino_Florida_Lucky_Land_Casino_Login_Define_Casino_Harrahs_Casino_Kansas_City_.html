<p>Evolution Group and Codere Online have teamed up for a content and gaming partnership in the iGaming market in Panama. The collaboration will see Evolution Group deliver a range of its dedicated live casino and slot library to boost its partner’s dedicated sportsbook and gaming domain, codere.pa.</p>
<p>The partnership brings along an impressive selection of products that Evolution Group has meticulously cultivated over the years to create the best possible experiences for players. This includes some of the world’s best live casino products, including traditional archetype games and game shows, and titles from NetEnt and Red Tiger, the Group’s slot content powerhouses acquired as a part of a major deal in 2020.</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed by both companies. Codere Online Regional Manager for Latin America, Salo Leder, said that the company was very excited to bring some of the best live casino and slot games to its players in Panama. Evolution Group’s titles, said Leder, were capable of replicating the excitement of visiting a land-based casino owing to their "stunning graphics and gameplay."</p>
<p>Evolution Head of Operations for LatAm, Mónica Umaña was similarly excited with this opportunity, and said: "We are proud of our long and successful partnership with Codere Online in multiple jurisdictions and delighted to have Codere Online as the first operator of our games in Panama."</p>
<p>She added that Latin America remained a key market for the Group and said that Codere Online’s local footprint was definitely a boon to Evolution’s further plans in the region.</p>
<p>The games that can appear on codere.pa would need the appropriate certification by the country’s Gaming Control Board, which has approved the first batch of titles to go live. Evolution Group is confident that more titles will be forthcoming over the next months.</p>
<p>Codere Online is the digital offshoot of the land-based business by the same name. The Codere Group has been a prominent gaming behemoth in Latin America and has expanded well beyond its bastions with overseas operations.</p>
<p>Codere Online presently operates in key iGaming markets, such as Panama, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Spain, and Italy in Europe. The Argentinian operations are limited to the City of Buenos Aires, as the whole country lets each province approve online gaming at its own pace and by its own rules. Codere Online is also the first publicly traded gaming giant hailing from Latin America to list on NASDAQ.</p>
<p>Evolution has also been expanding in the North American market. Four months ago, the company introduced its first live craps game in the United States. The company later doubled down on its US focus by opening a second studio in New Jersey last month, from where it can stream more content as the Group prepares for the further liberalization of the iGaming market in the United States.</p>
