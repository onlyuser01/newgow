    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Las Vegas The Orleans Casino Twin Rivers Casino Royal Ace Casino No Deposit Bonus S</h1>

<p>Global hospitality and casino franchise Resorts World opened its latest venue in the city of Newburgh, 60 miles north of New York City</p>
<p>The casino is situated in the Newburgh Mall and promises to provide long-term employment opportunities and attract many new guests and visitors. Newburgh residents expressed optimism that the extra business will help revitalize the local community.</p>
<p>The Casino Will Be a Boon to the Local Community</p>
<p>Resorts World Hudson Valley opened with fanfare on 28 December. The ribbon-cutting ceremony gathered representatives from the parent company Genting, local officials, and community leaders. Guests enjoyed a traditional Chinese lion dance performance and celebrated the occasion, sharing the hope that the new venue would enjoy lasting success.</p>
<p>Genting Americas East president Robert DeSalvio thanked everybody present for their efforts to realize the project, noting that the new casino would be a sizable boon to the local economy. The casino should hopefully provide a halo effect inside Newburgh Mall, boosting existing businesses and attracting new ones.</p>
<p>Along with our partners in Orange County, we are elated the casino is now open for business, and we can’t wait for the area to begin to reap the benefits. Robert DeSalvio, Genting Americas East president</p>
<p>Resorts World Hudson Valley creates 250 new full-time jobs with an average annual wage of $72,000. The casino operator also contributes approximately $65 million in taxes yearly, supporting NYS public schools. DeSalvio noted that the new venue planned to attract hundreds of thousands of guests and visitors, kicking off with a bang during the holiday season.</p>
<p>Genting Will Continue to Invest Heavily in the Area</p>
<p>The new casino is located in a 60,000 square feet space formerly occupied by a Bon Ton department store. After a thorough renovation, it is home to 1200 top-of-the-line slot machines and 82 electronic table games, also housing the Resorts World Bet Sports Bar. The venue already enjoys great popularity as over a thousand people waited in line to be the first inside.</p>
<p>Locals welcomed the new business, expressing hope that the increased foot traffic would help revitalize the struggling Newburgh Mall, which dates back to the 1980s. In addition to the Bon Ton store, the mall recently lost its Sears store. However, the new attraction should hopefully reverse the trend and help put Newburgh on the map.</p>
<p>Resorts World Hudson Valley is the third Genting venue in New York, joining Resorts World Catskills in Monticello and Resorts World New York City in Queens. The operator invested $50 million in the newly opened casino and $1.2 billion across the state. Genting’s plans for New York also count on obtaining one of the state’s first full casino licenses, allowing the company to introduce live dealers and host table games such as poker, roulette, and blackjack.</p>
