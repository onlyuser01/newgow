<p>The Seminole Tribe is also set to launch craps, roulette, and in-person sports betting at their casinos</p>
<p>Hard Rock Bet, Florida’s sole legal online sportsbook, went live on December 5, allowing all residents access to its platform. The Seminole Tribe, the driving force behind the betting platform, initiated the unexpected launch, deviating from the planned official release set for December 7.</p>
<p>Seminole Tribe’s Legal Odyssey to Introduce Online Sports Betting</p>
<p>The journey to this point has been marked by years of legal battles, with the Seminole Tribe overcoming hurdles to introduce online sports betting. Last month, a beta version of the platform was introduced exclusively to account holders and members of the Hard Rock loyalty scheme.</p>
<p>Despite legal challenges, the Seminole Tribe and Hard Rock pressed forward, defying attempts to halt the process through legal stays in both the US Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>
<p>The foundation for the exclusive online sports betting rights was laid in 2021 when Gov. Ron DeSantis inked a gaming compact with the Seminoles. This accord granted them exclusive statewide rights to online sports betting, utilizing a unique “hub-and-spoke” model to circumvent land requirements.</p>
<p>The legal saga took a twist when parimutuel betting operators, West Flagler Associates (WFA) and the Bonita-Fort Myers Corporation, challenged the compact in both federal and state courts. Despite initial victories for the parimutuels, the courts eventually sided with the Seminoles, affirming the compact’s validity against federal objections.</p>
<p>Seminoles Forge Ahead with Online Betting Amid Supreme Court Appeal</p>
<p>While legal avenues are yet to be exhausted, with WFA seeking a US Supreme Court appeal, the Seminoles proceeded with the online sports betting launch. However, there remains a cloud of uncertainty as the case could potentially force another shutdown of Hard Rock Bet if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the parimutuels.</p>
<p>This week, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody urged the state Supreme Court to dismiss the legal challenge by WFA against the legality of digital sports betting. Moody argued that WFA’s delayed filing, over two years after the 2021 compact between Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Seminoles, is grounds for dismissal.</p>
<p>WFA contended that the compact violates federal regulations, and while the Seminole Tribe has relaunched its Hard Rock Bets app, WFA has appealed to the US Supreme Court, seeking relief through federal courts.</p>
<p>The court has granted an extension until February for WFA to present its case. The Seminole Tribe will also be introducing craps, roulette, and in-person sports betting at their casinos. They anticipate positive economic impacts from these new offerings, boosting tourism and employment not only at the Seminole Hard Rock Hollywood but also in the surrounding areas and other Seminole Gaming-operated locations throughout Florida.</p>
