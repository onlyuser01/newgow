<p>For customers who want to set limits on their gambling we offer a voluntary self-exclusion policy, which allows you to close your Account or to restrict your gambling activities on the Service for a minimum of six months. Once your Account has been self-excluded, it will be closed until the expiry of the selected period. At the expiry of the self-exclusion period, you will be able to re-commence the use of any Services by contacting Customer Support.</p>
<p>If you want to set limits on your online activity then contact us at block@sapphirebet.com. We may limit the maximum amount of your stake. You can amend this amounts in any time but any change will be realize only in 24 hours after the last update.</p>

Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. The credit card might be needed to fully verify your account and make sure that it is you who’s requesting the account closure.</p>
