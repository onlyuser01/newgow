<p>The British gambling giant William Hill has consolidated its footprint in Nevada with the acquisition of CG Technologies and taking over the management of several Caesars Entertainment sportsbooks.</p>
<p>William Hill Secures CG Technologies Sportsbooks Management Contracts</p>
<p>William Hill, a British gaming company with presence in over ten states where sports betting is legal, is now expanding further in Las Vegas and Nevada. The company has so far managed the Sahara and Circus Circus sportsbooks on the Las Vegas Strip but this is about to change.</p>
<p>With the National Football League (NFL) in the offing, William Hill is looking at a tenfold increase of its operational capacity. The brand is already present in ten states including the recently legalized Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a new approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) issued on Wednesday, William Hill can take the reins of six sportsbooks on the Strip all managed by CG Technologies. That is the result of completion of a deal announced in November when William Hill said it was buying out CG Technologies and by extension, any existing management partnerships.</p>
<p>Yet, this is not everything. William Hill is currently negotiating assuming control over 11 additional sportsbooks in Nevada, cementing the British firm’s footprint in the state. At least nine of those are based in the Strip and were previously managed by Caesars Entertainment, the company that merged with Eldorado Resorts.</p>
<p>Speaking to the regulator during a virtual session, William Hill CEO Joe Asher offered assurances that any transition will be smooth for customers who won’t feel the difference. All CG mobile sports betting customers, however, will be prompted to use the dedicated William Hill mobile app.</p>
<p>William Hill to Retain the CG Workforce and Keep Expanding</p>
<p>William Hill won’t let go of CG Technologies workforce as well. Asher said that all CG Tech employees will transition and rally under the William Hill banner moving forward. While a conditional go-ahead has been given, the NGCB will finalize the deal on August 27.</p>
<p>Board members agreed that CG’s acquisition under William Hill was a positive step forwards for the company. As a result of the deal, William Hill will now manage sports betting operations at several prominent Strip locations, including:</p>
<p>Venetian Las Vegas</p>
<p>Palazzo</p>
<p>Tropicana Las Vegas</p>
<p>Cosmopolitan</p>
<p>There are several off-strip locations, too, including the Silverton and Palms Casino Resort. The only property not to change hands is the one formerly known as Hard Rock Las Vegas, which is now being remodeled into the Virgin Hotels Las Vegas and Mohegan Gaming will take control over it as a result and list Betfred USA Sports.</p>
<p>Currently, William Hill is in the process of taking over management operations for the Caesars Entertainment Books. Eldorado Resorts and William Hill US came to an understanding in 2018, with Eldorado acquiring a 20% stake in William Hill in exchange for a 25-year lease contract for William Hill to operate Eldorado’s sportsbooks in Nevada, sending a clear sign that the company wants to establish a notable footprint in the Silver State.</p>
<p>It must have succeeded because the company currently has 120 race and sports points in Nevada alone, varying from mobile sports betting to kiosks and other retail locations. The list is only tipped to grow.</p>
