<p>Sports betting-focused financial protection platform Wager Score announced its newest Don’t Fumble Your Finances campaign, partnering with the Cincinnati Bengals</p>
<p>The initiative aims to familiarize people with responsible gaming practices and introduce them to Wager Score’s automated solution.</p>
<p>Users Can Access an Intelligent Spending Solution</p>
<p>Wager Score is a safe gaming solution focusing on user protection through informed betting decisions. The free app automatically monitors the user’s sports betting expenses, assigning them a personalized affordability score and intelligent spending thresholds. Bettors receive emails and text messages whenever their score changes, preventing them from getting carried away and spending more than they can afford.</p>
<p>The platform features a rich library featuring a thoughtful selection of harm prevention resources. The company also partners with organizations like the National Problem Gambling Helpline Network and Gamble Responsible America. Wager Score focuses significantly on parent education, hoping to stem the rise of underage gambling.</p>
<p>The Platform Relies on Its Network of Partners</p>
<p>Wager Score’s latest collaboration with the Cincinnati Bengals arrives under the slogan Don’t Fumble Your Finances. New signups will get the chance to win four tickets to the Ravens versus Bengals game on 8 January 2022. The awareness campaign is part of Wager Score’s mission to create a more equitable, socially responsible betting industry.</p>
<p>Company co-founder Bo Grey expressed excitement about the initiative. He noted that Wager Score’s state-of-the-art technology and dedicated partners were a great boon to bettors. Grey thanked the Bengals for their support, stating that the team’s efforts would be instrumental in protecting the next generation and mitigating problematic gambling behaviors.</p>
<p>“Together, we are a movement ready to empower Gen Z to take responsible gaming into their own hands and make socially responsible sports betting an industry standard.” Company co-founder Bo Grey</p>

<p>The Bengals partnership is the most recent of several high-profile collaborations for Wager Score. The platform recently teamed up with operator Betfred. The UK-based sportsbook is the official sports betting partner of the Cincinnati Bengals and pledged to provide Wager Score with gaming data to improve the platform’s affordability updates. The two companies also promised to donate $100,000 to the Charles Oakley Foundation.</p>
<p>Ohio Is at the Forefront of Wager Score’s Efforts</p>
<p>Wager Score’s recent efforts have focused significantly on Ohio as the state prepares to launch its regulated sports betting market on 1 January. Bengals VP and chief marketing officer Brian Sells lauded the company’s responsible gaming and education efforts, reaffirming the team’s dedication to the well-being of their fans and community.</p>

<p>Ohio recently introduced its own responsible gambling campaign, joining the fight to protect consumers. The state administration’s efforts are inspired by an evidence-based approach, placing sports bettors and casino gamblers at the highest risk of developing an addiction. Ohio hopes to start the fight against problem gambling on the right foot, and the efforts of platforms like Wager Score and its partners are a significant cornerstone in these efforts.</p>
