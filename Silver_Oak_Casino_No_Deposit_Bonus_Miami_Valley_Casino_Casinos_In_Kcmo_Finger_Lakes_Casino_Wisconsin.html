<p>Novibet has signed an agreement with horse racing champion jockey Brian Hughes, marking its first horse racing agreement in history. The new deal is expected to strengthen the company’s position in the horse racing industry while improving its presence in the sports betting market in Ireland.</p>
<p>Brian Hughes, Novibet’s Partner for the Remainder of the Jump Jockeys Championship</p>
<p>The fresh deal will cover the rest of the 2021/22 UK Jump Jockeys Championship and it will closely follow 36-year-old Brian Hughes’ evolution. Born and raised in Northern Ireland, but currently based in Northern England, Hughes already recorded a thunderous start at the beginning of the Championship in 2021 when he celebrated his 100th winner of the season title. Hughes became the first jockey to reach the century milestone during the season.</p>
<p>He also managed to assert his dominance in front of his rival Sam Twiston-Davies as well as in the year’s title race that started on May 1. He is now leading the UK Jump Jockeys’ Championship with 90+ wins. The final event for the big title will be held at the Sandown racecourse on April 23.</p>
<p>Hughes also proudly displays a 2019/20 Championship title in his track record and is fully determined to take back his crown after losing it by a hair to Harry Skelton last season. The jockey’s impressive determination to regain his lost title is just one of the reasons that convinced Novibet to choose him for the deal. The company’s country manager Karl Riley called Hughes “UK’s champion-to-be” and described him as a “notoriously busy rider” that the company is eager to present to its customers.</p>
<p>The agreement is seen as a chance to trigger additional branding opportunities in the horse racing market while establishing the brand in Ireland. At the end of March, Novibet announced its merger with a special purpose acquisition company in a desire to go public on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In mid-January, the company brought in Giannis Papastamou and appointed him the new head of customer compliance, amid its global expansion.</p>
<p>Hughes expressed his eagerness to keep everyone updated with his progress and adventures via the weekly blog he will write on the company’s Novibet.ie website in Ireland. There, he will express his opinions on horse racing while introducing Novibet customers to the horse racing universe. The jockey also expressed his excitement to be adding Novibet.ie as a sponsor on his riding gear. Fully focused to hit the 200-winner mark and finish the season with flying colors, Hughes also has big plans to hold on to this title in the upcoming season.</p>
<p>Ever since its official launch in the gaming sector in Ireland in 2021, Novibet recorded steady customer growth. The company provides both casino and sports betting products and its operations feature special betting options that are driven by dedicated algorithms, along with a proprietary platform for sports betting that integrates a variety of data providers. Novibet offers premier hybrid cashout alternatives along with in-play and minute markets.</p>
