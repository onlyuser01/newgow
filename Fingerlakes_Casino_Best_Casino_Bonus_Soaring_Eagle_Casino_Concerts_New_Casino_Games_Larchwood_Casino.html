<p>The prestigious event that will feature experts within the gambling, technology and esports verticals is scheduled November 6-7 at Resorts Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey</p>
<p>An interesting and much-anticipated event for the gaming and esports sector is scheduled to take place next month in Atlantic City, New Jersey. November 6 would mark the start of the Casino Esport Conference (CEC), a prestigious event that plans to bring together experts from the gambling, esports and technology verticals. The event, scheduled between November 6 and November 7, 2023, at Resorts Hotel and Casino, is expected to attract not only industry experts but entrepreneurs and visionaries, to discuss popular trends relevant to the esports sector and its future growth and expansion.</p>
<p>During CEC, panels will include discussions related to technology, virtual reality, esports and wagering. Moreover, discussions will include popular topics such as the connection between gambling and esports, the development of immersive experiences and the advancements in technology that deliver unseen forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>In addition to the future of esports, CEC panels will include discussions on cybersecurity and how the iGaming sector can benefit from innovative technology. Undoubtedly, the panel on cybersecurity would be incredibly interesting, considering the recent unprecedented cyberattacks against MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>Long List of Experts Will Participate in the Upcoming Conference</p>
<p>The latest edition of the CEC builds upon a strong foundation. The conferences started nearly a decade ago, pushed by the great idea of Ari and Ben Fox, two brothers and visionaries who seek to revolutionize the esports sector. The annual events continue to address modern trends and by now, the CEC is renowned as a “leading platform, providing education and fostering collaboration across various domains.”</p>
<p>Similar to previous editions of the CEC, a long list of influential speakers are expected to participate in the upcoming event. This includes renowned professionals within the gambling and esports sectors, as well as seasoned veterans with knowledge of video gaming. “Together we will unlock new horizons and push the boundaries of gaming,” explains a statement released by CEC.</p>
<p>Ari Fox, one of the visionaries behind CEC, who was recently cited by CDC Gaming Reports, shared his excitement on the topic. He explained that ever since the start of CEC in 2017, an ongoing focus was the innovation within the industry and ways “to attract younger audiences and build a better infrastructure.” Fox spoke about the challenges the gaming industry is facing explaining: “There’s a disconnect between paying their employees to be in a happy space, providing better service and hospitality, and what younger customers are looking for.” According to him, the CEC is actively addressing rising different challenges in the industry.</p>
