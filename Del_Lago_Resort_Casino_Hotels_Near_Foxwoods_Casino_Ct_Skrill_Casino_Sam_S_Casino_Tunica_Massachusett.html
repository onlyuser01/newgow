<p>Leading global player in the fast-growing iGaming market ComeOn Group has announced it was prepared to launch a fresh overarching program with a strong focus on promoting mental health in local communities. The program will be called ComeOn Cares and its launch will be possible with help from the Malta-based non-governmental organization Richmond Foundation.</p>
<p>ComeOn Cares – Preventing Mental Health Problems</p>
<p>The new ComeOn Cares program will reunite a series of important projects with a strong focus on mental health problems, with emphasis on many of the topics that the Richmond Foundation already specializes in. Just like its current prevention initiatives aimed at mental health problems, the foundation will help the ComeOn group provide in-person support to local communities. The main goal of the program will be to bring significant improvements to the quality of life of those impacted by mental health problems. ComeOn Cares will, therefore, include a dedicated employee assistance program called “Healthy Minds Work” that will be available at various locations. Mental health issues are known to cause huge losses for employers because of related absenteeism and presenteeism problems. “Healthy Minds Work” has been created to help organizations gradually eliminate the symptoms and work together with their employees to nurture a healthier and brighter future ahead.</p>
<p>Free Mental Health First Aid Courses</p>
<p>ComeOn will also sponsor a series of additional programs aiming to support the mental health of local communities via the same collaboration with the foundation. The group will take advantage of the foundation’s experience in providing optimal community mental health care while promoting mental well-being through a free Mental Health First Aid program. The courses part of the free program will be available to the general public. The ComeOn Group is fully committed to promoting the well-being of its staff and the local community. This is why it will continue to put this topic at the core of its corporate social responsibility and people strategy.</p>
<p>ComeOn has also rolled out a volunteering program for its 550 employees, allowing them to select a cause they would like to support and volunteer for. The list includes animal shelter assistance, group clean-ups, and offering different forms of help to local communities.</p>
<p>At the end of September, the ComeOn Group announced it would receive two branded games designed for two of its Swedish iGaming casinos. The month before, the group unveiled a fresh proprietary casino application programming interface pioneered by Germany-based Apparat Gaming.</p>
