<p>Premier online sports betting brand Betway entered into a multi-year agreement with the National Hockey League (NHL) to become an Official Sports Betting Partner of the league, Super Group, the parent company of the brand announced today.</p>
<p>“It’s an incredibly proud moment as we announce our first North American sports league partnership with the NHL.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>First North American Sports League Partnership</p>
<p>The deal which marks a significant milestone for Betway as being the first for the sports betting brand with a North American professional sports league is set to launch with the start of the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Starting with the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Betway brand will receive major exposure to sports fans around the globe and that will continue at other NHL tentpole events throughout the calendar, which is hugely exciting for us.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>Via the new partnership, Betway will gain global visibility and brand exposure with a corner in-ice position and camera-visible dasher board signage available for all games of the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs and 2021 Stanley Cup Final, as well as throughout the duration of the multi-year deal.</p>
<p>“This deal strengthens our strategy to expand our global customer base by partnering with the biggest leagues in the most popular sports around the world. Tens of millions of viewers will see the Betway logo on the ice for these prestigious games as we make ourselves known to a new audience in the U.S. and beyond.” Neal Menashe, CEO, Super Group</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Betway will also get brand visibility at tentpole events of the NHL such as the NHL Winter Classic, NHL Stadium Series and NHL All-Star Weekend, again via a corner in-ice positioned brand signage.</p>
<p>“The Stanley Cup Playoffs is the most exciting two months in sports and delivers a tremendous opportunity for fan engagement on a global basis.” Keith Wachtel, Chief Business Officer and Senior Executive Vice President, NHL</p>
<p>Logos, Marks and Campaigns to Boost Customer Acquisition</p>
<p>Besides increased brand awareness among fans of professional hockey, Betway will receive the right to use official logos, marks and designations of the NHL to be able to design authentic marketing programs tailored to the NHL fan.</p>
<p>“With the sports betting category continuing to evolve at a rapid pace, we’re thrilled to launch our new partnership with Betway at this very exciting time of our season. Betway has a very aggressive growth strategy and are an ideal partner to engage with our avid fan base.” Keith Wachtel, Chief Business Officer and Senior Executive Vice President, NHL</p>
<p>The deal will also ensure Betway gains access to all media assets of the professional hockey league, including custom digital, social and email marketing initiatives, to help the sports betting brand build further brand awareness and expand its customer base.</p>
<p>The agreement with the NHL is the latest step Betway takes to establish itself as a recognized brand among sports fans in the US. In March, the online sports betting brand entered into multiple sponsorship deals with franchises from the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the New York Islanders of the NHL.</p>
