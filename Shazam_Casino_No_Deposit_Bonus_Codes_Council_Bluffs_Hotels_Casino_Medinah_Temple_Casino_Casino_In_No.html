<p>In its lawsuit, the global gaming content and technology company alleges the game design director downloaded more than 6,800 files from its servers back in December</p>
<p>Operators offering sports betting and gambling services across the globe have strict rules when it comes to data protection. The access of senior-level employees is monitored while the protection of intellectual property remains an important priority for developers within the gambling sector.</p>
<p>Now, a new report reveals that an Aristocrat employee is facing legal action over allegedly downloading more than 6,800 files from its services. As announced by the Associated Press, Dinh Toan Tran, a game designer with Aristocrat, is in hot water after the leading gaming operator filed a lawsuit, claiming he downloaded thousands of files.</p>
<p>The alleged incident dates back to December. In its lawsuit, the leading pokies developer claims Tran downloaded more than 6,800 files. With the lawsuit, Aristocrat seeks to recover the files.</p>
<p>During a court hearing last week, the company secured a search order from the Federal Court. Consequently, a property where Tran allegedly resided was searched. During the search, electronic devices such as tablets, laptops and external storage devices were seized.</p>
<p>The Court ordered Tran to provide the details needed to log in while at the same time asking him to reveal his whereabouts. Moreover, Tran was ordered not to delete or discard any documents, files or other intellectual property that may belong to the company. Experts are currently analyzing the information uncovered on the devices that were seized during the search that happened at a property located in western Sydney.</p>
<p>Analysis of the Information from the Seized Devices Continues</p>
<p>Ken Brotherson, is the lawyer representing the employee. He confirmed that his client wasn’t present when the search warrants were executed.</p>
<p>Federal Court Justice Yaseen Shariff explained that Aristocrat had a right to determine whether it was wrong or right about its suspicion of the downloaded files. He explained: “It seems to me everything has been done extremely professionally.”</p>
<p>It is yet to be confirmed if Tran indeed obtained any company files. Currently, it remains unclear what the essence of those files might be. Still, John Hennessy SC, Aristocrat’s barrister, informed the court on Thursday that a specific USB storage device is “the focus of the investigation.” Investigation and analysis of the files obtained during the searches continue.</p>
<p>The legal action comes after in December, Aristocrat announced the launch of its 3rd NFL-themed game, Overtime Cash. The launch reaffirmed the company’s successful relationship with the NFL and further expanded the portfolio of games for fans of the sport.</p>
