<p>DraftKings Becomes Betting Partner for Knicks, Rangers with MSG</p>
<p>US-based sportsbook DraftKings has signed a partnership with Madison Square Garden Company to represent NBA and NHL franchises the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers.</p>
<p>Sports &amp; fantasy betting company DraftKings has become the exclusive betting partner of the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers, amid the launch of mobile betting in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>NH pushed successfully for online gambling with the help of DraftKings, as the state and sportsbook signed a pivotal, multi-year partnership.</p>
<p>The partnership was announced on Thursday, January 2, and it also covers the Madison Square Garden Company (MSG) namesake arena.</p>
<p>Both the Knicks and Rangers, an NBA and NHL franchise respectively, are home-based in New York and the MSG Arena in particular.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the partnership builds upon a previously established tie-up with the company when DraftKings and MTG negotiated a DFS deal between the two parties back in 2015.</p>
<p>Moving forward, DraftKings hopes to boost awareness and exposure among sports fans.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest partnership, MSG VP for Marketing Partnerships, Ron Skotarczak, praised the business footprint of DraftKings.</p>
<p>The company, Mr. Skotarczak acknowledged, had established itself as one of the most successful sportsbooks.</p>
<p>DraftKings Chief Business Officer, Ezra Kucharz, was also pleased with the development.</p>
<p>Mr. Kucharz particularly liked the opportunity to work with “two of the most iconic franchises in all of sports that play here,” referring to the Madison Square Garden Arena.</p>
<p>What Are the Specific Benefits?</p>
<p>DraftKings and MSG will work to reach synergies similar to previous partnerships. So far, they include:</p>
<p>Digital and static signage at the premises of the venue</p>
<p>and at the premises of the venue Branding of the penalty box , team benches , and apron of the court</p>
<p>, , and Various activations held for Knicks and Rangers fans throughout the year</p>
<p>Another big opportunity for DraftKings will be the untapped potential of New York mobile betting, which should be arriving sooner or later.</p>
<p>Preparing for the Online Explosion of NY Sports Betting</p>
<p>New York has been toying with the idea of legalizing sports betting, with MSG pushing for mobile gambling as early as June, 2019. However, until this happens, most New Yorkers have to travel to the del Lago Resort &amp; Casino, which is an official DraftKings partner.</p>
<p>DraftKings has been widely successfully elsewhere, and particularly in New Hampshire, where the platform holds a full control over the market on behalf of the State Lottery.</p>
<p>On the first day of action, some 6,000 people registered and the total sports betting handle reached $250,000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New Hampshire is also the second New England state that offers mobile betting to sports fans interested in the latest competitions.</p>
