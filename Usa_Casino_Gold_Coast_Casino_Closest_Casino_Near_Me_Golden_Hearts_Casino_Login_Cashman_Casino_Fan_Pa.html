<p>Provider of technology and content for the global gaming industry Inspired Entertainment announced today pub markets in the UK can enjoy two of its most popular themes on the company’s Prismatic cabinet featuring at Category C pubs nationwide.</p>
<p>Expanding Themes across Category C Pubs</p>
<p>Centurion and Catch of the Day, two of Inspired Entertainment’s themes, will be now available to Category C pub markets in the UK, following their successful debut on the Prismatic cabinet in December 2021 that made them instantly recognizable to players in the country.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to kickstart the year for our pub customers with these two high-performing themes, leveraging the extensive stable of high-performing games available to us.” Peter Davies, Managing Director, Leisure, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>With just a few weeks of operation, both the Centurion and Catch of the Day themes became extremely popular with pub players while serving Inspired’s omnichannel strategy to offer its pub and retail clients multi-faceted content.</p>
<p>“Inspired is fully invested in developing exciting new content and products for our pub business and increasing our digital footprint to bring great games to pub players right across our customers’ estates.” Peter Davies, Managing Director, Leisure, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>With over one billion lifetime plays to date, Centurion established itself as the all-time favorite theme of players, with their beloved Centurion character offering them more than eight bonus games with mega-rich bonus experience across its 5×3 reels.</p>
<p>Also across 5×3 reels with 10 of its lines always in play, Catch of the Day features a video slot game fish-theme on the background of colorful coral reefs and provides players with the opportunity to win a free game by hitting three or more scatter symbols within a single base game spin.</p>
<p>Significant Presence across Retail Gaming Markets</p>
<p>Inspired’s gaming content and solutions are live across 35 jurisdictions worldwide, powering gaming systems for around 50,000 gaming machines located in betting shops, pubs, gaming halls, and other establishments.</p>
<p>The company offers a rich portfolio of content, technology, and hardware for sports betting, lottery, and leisure operators from the land-based and digital gaming industry while its products help Inspired’s customers engage with players and grow their revenues.</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment signed a content partnership deal with Rush Street Interactive (RSI) in December last year to deploy four of its popular game titles among which Christmas Cashpots, Big Spin Bonus, and Santa King across RSI’s platform in New Jersey, Michigan and West Virginia.</p>
