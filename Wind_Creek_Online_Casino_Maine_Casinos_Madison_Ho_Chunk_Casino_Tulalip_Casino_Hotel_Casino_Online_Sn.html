<p>MGM Resorts would achieve synergies and ensure a retendering of the MGM China concession in Macau if it sells a 20% stake from its Chinese subsidiary to a strategic partner from the internet or travel and leisure industries in China, Sean Ma, Founder and CEO of Snow Lake Capital investment fund wrote in a letter to the Las Vegas-based gaming operator.</p>
<p>The Asian investment firm which manages in excess of $3 billion in assets and holds approximately 7.5% of outstanding shares of MGM China, a stake that makes it the largest public shareholder of the company, strongly believes such a scenario would represent a win-win situation for both parties involved.</p>
<p>Snow Lakes Capital outlined in its letter several reasons that such a move would create significant shareholder value to both companies, and even suggested a few possible Chinese companies which could easily be interested in acquiring a stake in MGM China.</p>
<p>Diversification away from Gambling</p>
<p>A new strategic partner would significantly increase MGM China’s exposure to non-gaming operations, a key factor for the retendering process, Snow Lake Capital noted, due to the clearly stated by China’s State Council long-term goal to develop Macau as a global travel and leisure destination, as per the “Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area” the council published in February 2019.</p>
<p>Market Value Gain from Rerating Will Offset Sale</p>
<p>Comparing all six concession holders, Snow Lake Capital pointed that MGM China’s market valuation was 20% to 30% lower, mainly due to the uncertainty from the retendering process, as Macau officials already publicly announced there would be no subconcessions this time around.</p>
<p>Due to the significantly increased outlook of securing a new concession in 2022, markets would revalue MGM China stock, which currently trades at the bottom of all 6 compared by enterprise value to 2019 EBITDA, and if the stock goes to the sector average, it would be a 13% rise. In case MGM stock goes further up, to match the sector leader, the upside potential is 32%.</p>
<p>Sale Receipts to Fund Japan IR Application</p>
<p>The letter pointed out the sale of the 20% stake in MGM China would generate around $1.3 billion in cash, while MGM Resorts would need $2.4 billion to cover its 40% participation in the Osaka IR project, estimated at $12 billion, of which 50% would be debt-financed on the 40% participation precondition.</p>
<p>MGM and Orix Corporation would participate with equal shares and leave 20% of the IR Osaka casino project to a consortium of local investors.</p>
<p>Among the other reasons Snow Lake pointed out was the benefit from a potential partnership between MGM China Co-Chairman Pansy Ho and the new strategic partner, the positioning of MGM as a strategic partner for the investor’s internalization efforts, as well as the greater financial flexibility to make a more attractive bid to acquire its sports betting joint venture partner Entain Plc.</p>
<p>In response to the letter MGM Resorts released a statement Wednesday noting that</p>
<p>“MGM Resorts remains committed to Macau and will continue to take actions that are in the best interests of its shareholders and stakeholders”</p>
<p>while appreciating the level of constructive engagement it holds with MGM China shareholders.</p>
