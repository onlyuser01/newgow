<p>Caesars Entertainment and Turner announced the partnership this week. The studio will stream live gaming-related content to the Bleacher Report website, and could also be featured on Turner’s numerous television networks including CNN, TNT, TBS, and TruTV.</p>
<p>Details of the partnership were not disclosed. The specific space where the studio will be built was also kept under wraps.</p>
<p>The sports gaming industry is rapidly growing,” Turner Sports President Lenny Daniels said. “Gaming content will be a key driver for increasing fan engagement across all platforms, including time spent watching live sporting events.”</p>
<p>The goal for Caesars is to better familiarize its brand with sports fans, as betting on professional and collegiate events expands across the US.</p>
<p>Caesars Palace isn’t the first sportsbook that will have a live studio. The Vegas Stats &amp; Information Network (VSiN) broadcasts live from the South Point Casino in Las Vegas, and Ocean Resort in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Casinos and Sports Intertwine</p>
<p>The gaming industry is quickly embracing the world of sports following the US Supreme Court’s repeal of the federal ban on sports betting last May. Casino operators are forming partnerships with all four big professional sports leagues in the US, as the battle for market share is well underway.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts is an “official gaming partner” of the NBA and WNBA, and also MLB and NHL. Caesars became the “official casino sponsor” of the NFL last month, but won’t be permitted to advertise its sports betting products under the agreement.</p>
<p>Caesars will have a strong presence at the forthcoming $1.8 billion Las Vegas Stadium that will become the home of the NFL Raiders next year. Last fall, the casino company revealed that its most loyal customers will have access to the Caesars “Owners Suite” at the 50-yard line, VIP dinners on the field, fantasy camp participation, stadium tours, and tickets to Raiders games and stadium events.</p>
<p>The partnership with the stadium will allow Caesars to advertise its portfolio of resorts at various stadium locations.</p>
<p>New Year, New Caesars</p>
<p>2019 is a year of reinvention for Caesars Entertainment. The search for CEO Mark Frissora’s successor continues, as the casino operator reduces its dependence on gaming and seeks international expansion.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was revealed that the Total Rewards loyalty program was being rebranded Caesars Rewards, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Guests know the Caesars brand, and Caesars Rewards helps us strengthen that connection across our global network,” Frissora stated. “Caesars Rewards is a powerful engine that connects our members to the full Caesars empire and everything it has to offer.”</p>
<p>Along with sports betting, Caesars is licensing four of its hotels – Caesars Palace, Flamingo, The Cromwell, and The Linq – to hotel developers. The strategy is to move into the non-gaming hospitality sector, while not being on the hook to build from the ground up properties.</p>
<p>Caesars’ global mission began with deals in Dubai and Puerto Los Cabos, Mexico, two non-gaming resorts.</p>
