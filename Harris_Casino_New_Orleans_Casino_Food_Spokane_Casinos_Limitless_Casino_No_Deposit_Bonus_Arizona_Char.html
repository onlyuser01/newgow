    <h1>Harris Casino New Orleans Casino Food Spokane Casinos Limitless Casino No Deposit Bonus Arizona Char</h1>

<p>Hello, this is going to be a long message. I really hope that with your help I can finally verify my account and pay out the money. First of all I would like to point out that I have had my campobet account for over two years. During this period no one wanted any verification from me, because of course I was a losing player, although I made a few withdrawals. In the last 3 months I have won over 21500 zł (5000€) mainly betting on sports. I managed to withdraw 1500 PLN, further withdrawals were stopped, I got a betting limit (1€) and they asked me to verify my account. The procedure started on 14.04, since then I sent them my ID, revolut account statement, bank statement, screenshot from muchbetter app and muchbetter statement. I also sent a picture of the debit card I used to make the deposit, they asked for a picture of another card which is a virtual card in the revolut app and cannot be photographed or even screenshotted in the app. So I took a screenshot of the card details with another phone. Suddenly now after a month they still want a picture of a card that doesn't physically exist!!! They didn't like the bank statement as a scan, so I took a picture and sent it. Suddenly they ask me for a photo of a card that I used there many months ago and which has not been used for my current winnings. This card is already blocked and destroyed, I sent campobet an official email stating that the card is no longer active. campobet wants a document confirming that the card is inactive, unfortunately revolut does not issue such documents, they only send an email with the information. I have confirmation from revolut support that they do not issue such documents. To sum up, campobet has already received all the necessary information and even more to verify my identity, but they are dragging it out indefinitely hoping that I will lose the money accumulated on my account. I can send you all the emails I have listed</p>
<p>with campobet and proof that I have given them all the necessary documents. I am really asking for help from your side, please.</p>
