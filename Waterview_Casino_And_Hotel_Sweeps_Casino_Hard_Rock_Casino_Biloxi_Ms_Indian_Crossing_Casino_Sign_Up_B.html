    <h1>Waterview Casino And Hotel Sweeps Casino Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Ms Indian Crossing Casino Sign Up B</h1>

<p>Stakelogic Live has launched its products with the Dutch casino operator Kansino. As a result, the supplier is deploying its entire variety of live games with the brand in the Netherlands, including popular choices such as Auto Roulette, Auto Roulette Classic, European Roulette, and American Blackjack among others.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Expecting to Make Splash with Dutch Players</p>
<p>Welcoming this opportunity, Kansino head of casino Daphne Xerri said that the brand was committed to offering its players some of the best online casino experiences possible, featuring a range of high-quality products.</p>
<p>Xerri argued that the live segment has been particularly successful and that Kansino was interested in expanding its reach through fresh title additions:</p>
<p>“Live casino has proved to be hugely popular among players in the Netherlands, and when it comes to providing the most engaging and authentic live experience, Stakelogic Live is ahead of the game.” Kansino head of casino Daphne Xerri</p>
<p>To further strengthen its presence in the live segment, Kansino will double down on its live offer and introduce a branded live dealer studio that will feature European Roulette and Blackjack tables and bear the distinct signature style of the casino property.</p>
<p>This project will be realized with Stakelogic Live which will operate the studio directly in the Netherlands and the broadcasts will be facilitated by Relax Gaming. Stakelogic CEO Stephan van den Qetelaar welcomed the opportunity to be expanding the company’s reach in the Netherlands and praised the interest in the live casino vertical from local players and brands.</p>
<p>Delivering the Content that Players Expect</p>
<p>Van den Qetelaar was pleased that it will be with Kansino that Stakelogic will be able to offer its products in the market for the first time and added:</p>
<p>“Live casino promises to be an important vertical in the Dutch market and it is great that Kansino knows just how significant it will be by also launching its own dedicated studio with us.” Stakelogic CEO Stephan van den Qetelaar</p>
<p>The executive expressed confidence that thanks to this tie-up, Kansino will be able to deliver a unique live experience that players in the Dutch market will appreciate and enjoy. The Dutch market is one of the newest European markets to regulate its casino segment and it’s constantly courted by new operators and suppliers.</p>
<p>The Stakelogic Live casino team is led by Richard Walker who joined the company and will be looking over the live casino rollout in the Netherlands.</p>
