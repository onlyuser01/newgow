<p>Nexiux Solutions has teamed up with Kingmaker Games, offering the network provider’s partners access to a rich library of casino content and games</p>
<p>The partnership focuses on Kingmaker’s exclusive content developed to cover blockchain gaming experiences with games such as Plinko, Rocket, Minesweeper, and Crash-style games, among others.</p>
<p>Bringing Innovation to Nexiux Solutions’ Network of Operators</p>
<p>Nexiux, which provides a diverse range of services for the iGaming sector, will further leverage Kingmaker’s portfolio, and introduce it to a number of its own partner operators across the globe.</p>
<p>All launches will focus on licensed and regulated markets with Kingmaker’s table and slot games, along with the blockchain gaming-inspired titles all appearing on the library of authorized brands.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Nexiux Solutions head of products Rob Verdia welcomed the new partner and outlined the significance of the collaboration, hailing the companies as like-minded entities sharing the same focus on bringing top-level entertainment:</p>
<p>This makes Kingmaker a natural content partner for Nexiux, allowing us to offer our partners new and exciting content. Nexiux Solutions head of products Rob Verdia</p>
<p>Verdia further noted that Kingmaker has an established track record for providing content that is not only regulation-ready but one that specifically meets demands in local markets, giving any partner of Kingmaker’s a significant advantage.</p>
<p>Nexiux provides games from other suppliers as well, to wit Red Tiger, Global Games, Pragmatic Play, and other established studios. The acceptance of Kingmaker is proof that the innovative developer has earned a place among the top suppliers as well.</p>
<p>Adding Firepower to the Content Portfolio</p>
<p>“This adds serious firepower to our game portfolio and will allow our partners to stand out and engage more players than ever before,” Verdia concluded. AS to Nexiux, the company is actually powering a number of prominent companies and betting firms, including Fun88, Sportsbet.io, and Stake.com among many others.</p>
<p>Kingmaker games head of marketing Nathan Templeman was similarly pleased with the latest partnership outcome and explained that the company’s games were designed to bring inspired crypto gamification models to the mass market and specifically – in regulated iGaming jurisdictions.</p>
