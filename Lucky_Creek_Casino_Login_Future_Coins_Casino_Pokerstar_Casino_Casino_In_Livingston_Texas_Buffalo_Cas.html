<p>WynnBET has gone live in Virginia following a strategic partnership with NASCAR and presence at two raceways in the state.</p>
<p>NASCAR Partner WynnBET Rolls Out in VA</p>
<p>NASCAR authorized gaming partner WynnBET has obtained a permit and launched into Virginia, bringing its dedicated wagering experience along in yet another jurisdiction in the United States and following the company’s recent forays into Iowa, Ohio, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>This is a continuation of the operator’s ongoing partnership with NASCAR in a bid to create tailored content and promote better engagement with regular sports fans, and boost awareness about sports betting in Virginia and beyond.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, NASCAR SVP and chief digital officer Tim Clark said that the partnership with Wynn Resorts and the company’s betting arm is already having an impact on the organization’s footprint.</p>
<p>Clark paid his thanks to the Virginia Lottery, the gaming regulator, which had allowed WynnBET to expand into yet another state and bring the state-of-the-art NASCAR race experience to yet another jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Players who are at least 21 years of age or older can access the dedicated WynnBET apps and download them on both Apple and Android. WynnBET is not a chance entry into the state either.</p>
<p>Since the Virginia General Assembly passed a law to legalize sports betting, WynnBet has been trying to improve its positions within the state. It has established partnerships with both Richmond Raceway and Martinsville Speedway and was among the 25 organizations to apply for a license in October 2020.</p>
<p>WynnBET has been one of the biggest names in the US sports betting climate, securing one pivotal partnership after another. Wynn Resorts’ digital betting business has focused on securing closer ties with data providers and various sports franchises, including the Detroit Pistons, earlier in March.</p>
<p>The company continues to pursue further growth opportunities in the United States as 25-odd states are already regulating sports betting, with many more in the pipeline.</p>
