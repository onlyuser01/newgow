<p>Global provider of advanced wagering products and technology EBET announced it has entered into a media marketing agreement with Metagames Marketing to gain access to one of the largest digital and TV networks in the Spanish-speaking world.</p>
<p>Media Campaign to Drive Traffic</p>
<p>Under the sportsbook and exclusive casino wagering media marketing agreement, Metagames Marketing will utilize its affiliate partners to provide EBET with media placements and will be entitled to a share of the net gaming revenue generated over the sportsbook and online casino verticals.</p>
<p>“The creative opportunities for integrating EBET’s brands in the top TV shows and national networks could be a catalyst in driving high volumes of traffic,” commented Teodoro Perez, principal of Metagames, excited to begin working with EBET and “exposing their brands to this massive Latin American audience.”</p>
<p>By gaining access to 45 national TV networks, 68 radio stations and 65 movie theaters across Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic, EBET will significantly expand its presence in the Latin American region.</p>
<p>Hailing the agreement as an “incredible opportunity for EBET and its leading brands to gain exposure to an audience of millions,” EBET chief executive officer Aaron Speech was equally excited to collaborate with Metagames and “expand EBET’s access to more countries” in Latin America.</p>
<p>Featuring across TV and Radio Shows</p>
<p>Comprising traditional TV and radio spots, integrated brand placement and contests, the media campaign will feature during daytime programming and reality TV shows, including Combate, Sabadismo and Magaly TV, propping EBET’s Karamba brand with full segments and interactive games. Full online video and banner campaigns will feature on the shows’ social channels and the networks’ streaming channels.</p>
<p>Besides the Karamba brand, EBET operates online sportsbook and casino gaming brands Hopa, Griffon Casino, BetTarget, Dansk777, GenerationVIP and Gogawi, boasting a total of over 1.4 million depositors across more than 15 countries around the world.</p>
<p>Formerly known as Esports Technology rebranded to EBET in May to better communicate the company’s vision and appointed Jon Najarian, a prominent trader, public and sports personality, and entrepreneur in an advisory capacity in August to help the business deal with matters related to the securities and futures markets in the future and benefit from his clout as a regular contributor on CNBC Business TV and his sporting career for the Chicago Bears.</p>
<p>On the financial side, EBET recently released a trading update for July and August and revealed its strategy that places the focus on higher-margin betting products and eliminates non-material contracts began to bear fruit.</p>
