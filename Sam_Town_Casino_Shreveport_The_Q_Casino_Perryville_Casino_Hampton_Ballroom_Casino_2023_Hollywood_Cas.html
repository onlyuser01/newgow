    <h1>Sam Town Casino Shreveport The Q Casino Perryville Casino Hampton Ballroom Casino 2023 Hollywood Cas</h1>

<p>That was the answer the casino left with another complaints center:</p>
<p>After we completed integration with Playson and Microgaming there was a tech issue with some of the games from Playson - players could make bets with 0 balance on their account. Players are well aware that it's against all the T&amp;C and that it was a tech issue.</p>
<p>But he continued playing and the winnings that he made with those "free" bets were canceled by us since they were not legit. So, nobody was trying to cheat him or smth.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>So and now they should prove to me that Microgaming / Playson really had a malfunction. Because if that is the case, anyone can come and say there was a mistake and all winnings will be canceled. Where is my player protection? I enter into a contract with the casino and the machines should be running! And if he can't provide that, it's not my problem. I also never played with a € 0 balance. I saw my wager and the balance all the time, as it can be seen on this casino site. I had a 1500x at Bonanza for 5 € and simply dared to do that. I never had my balance on 0 !! And now I ask myself what can be done about such a fraud ??? Please help me . The win was compliant and the casino does not want to pay it out.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
