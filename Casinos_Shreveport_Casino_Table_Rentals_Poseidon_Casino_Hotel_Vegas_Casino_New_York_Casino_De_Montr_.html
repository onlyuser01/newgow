    <h1>Casinos Shreveport Casino Table Rentals Poseidon Casino Hotel Vegas Casino New York Casino De Montr</h1>

<p>Back in the beginning for Feb of this year I played in this casino for the first time and managed to win using a No deposit bonus. The max that could be withdrawn was $50 so I put in the withdrawal request sent in all my required documents for account verification and made a $25 deposit per their terms and conditions in order to receive my withdrawal It is now almost 5 months later, and despite numerous emails and multiple conversations with customer support agents, I still have not received my payout. At first I was getting emails telling me congratulations on your win your $ is on its way and blah blah blah. But now I do not even get responses to my emails inquiring about the payout. And the customer service ppl I have spoken with, who genuinely seem to feel bad that I keep getting the run around about this, they keep sending I guess the finance ppl highlighted and tagged messages about my inquiries in the hopes that it will be promptly addressed once seen , but this has yet to happen. Then couple of days ago, I received an email stating that my withdrawal request had been successfully reversed. Now just WTH is this about?? So I replied to the email explaining that I did not request a reversal and have actually been contacting them repeatedly since Feb attempting to get with withdrawal request addressed I also went back into the casino and requested another withdrawal on the funds that were reversed and informed the casino finance ppl that I had done so and that I would appreciate this being taken care of asap as this is going on 5 months now I realize it’s only $50 but that’s not the point anymore. It’s about them honoring their end of things as I won this fair and square and even made a deposit in order to withdraw it But to be honest, my intuition tells me that this new withdrawal request will still be sitting there pending 6 months from now</p>
