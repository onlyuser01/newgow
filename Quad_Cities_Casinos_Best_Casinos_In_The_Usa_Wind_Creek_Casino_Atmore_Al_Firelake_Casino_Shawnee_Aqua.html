<p>The provider that mixes proven recipes with fresh ideas to deliver value-driven experiences to players in globally regulated markets announced its titles would be integrated into Caesars Ontario via Pariplay Integrates in March.</p>
<p>Now, the fresh gangster-themed La Mafia Heist slot is ready to welcome players passionate about the genre with overflowing cash bags representing the wild symbols in the game.</p>
<p>Provided a Big Block Mafia symbol is seen landing while engaged in the gameplay, players could see it change into a Big Block 3×3 symbol that would take over the middle reels for enhanced win potential.</p>
<p>When players manage to land a minimum of three scatter symbols will engage the Vault Free Spins round. During this round, reels two, three, and four will mix and generate a guaranteed Big Block 3×3 symbol. The latter will trigger even more generous rewards.</p>
<p>At the same time, players who land an additional scatter symbol during this round receive three additional Free Spins.</p>
<p>The Gold Reserve Feature</p>
<p>When the Big Block Gold Bullion bar lands while playing the base game, players will see the Gold Reserve feature get triggered. When this will occur, the symbols will remain in place during three respins.</p>
<p>The respins counter will automatically reset every time a new Gold Bullion symbol is seen popping up. Similar effects are generated when a minimum of six regular gold bars are seen landing during base gameplay.</p>
<p>La Mafia Heist is the freshest release joining Wizard Games’ portfolio of 130 top-quality games created to match players’ preferences and casinos’ business goals. Prior to that, the company released Book of Eternal Romance at the end of April and Princess Celina and the Frog in February.</p>
<p>Wizard Games is currently getting ready to release Majestic North, a 5×4 slot with 1024 winning ways and a majestic Canadian wilderness theme in place.</p>
<p>Wizard Games’ director of games studio Simon Jagdhar has expressed their thrill about “bringing players on a fast-paced adventure” with their freshest release, mentioning the numerous winning opportunities that include the Vault Free Spins and the Gold Reserve bonus.</p>
<p>At the start of April, Wizard Games released the Funky Boombox, a groovy 5×3 slot carrying players back in the eighties.</p>
