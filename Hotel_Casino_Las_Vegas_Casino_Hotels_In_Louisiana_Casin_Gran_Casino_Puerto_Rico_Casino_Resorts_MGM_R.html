<p>MGM Resorts and BetMGM have vowed to promote and spearhead a new initiative focused on responsible gambling during Responsible Gambling Education Month or RGEM for short. September is designated as a month focused on raising awareness about the hidden dangers of the gambling industry which could have ruinous consequences for vulnerable consumers who fall into bad habits.</p>
<p>American Gaming Association to Help Brands Deliver the Message</p>
<p>In the United States where the bulk of the companies’ business is, the American Gaming Association (AGA) has called for companies and brands to participate more actively in raising awareness of the issue and help consumers understand the pitfalls a seemingly innocuous hobby may have.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts and BetMGM are both members of AGA’s “Have A Game Plan” and “Bet Responsibly” initiatives which are tailored to the needs of casual and more experienced gamblers, and the companies will continue to work with AGA during RGEM.</p>
<p>AGA does not put it past anyone to fall into an addictive or reckless gambling pattern, hence why ongoing efforts continue to help at-risk consumers while also educating the broader public to prevent the issue in the first place. The companies are going to use all of their available channels of communication to ensure that they have their voices about responsible and safe gambling heard.</p>
<p>This will involve print materials and social media campaigns which will stress the companies’ commitment to a number of safe gambling measures and precautions. One of those is the GameSense responsible gambling program based in Canada and developed by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s responsible gaming program manager Richard Taylor welcomed the opportunity to be doubling down on the company’s efforts to deliver exceptional customer service with a clear focus on responsible gaming. “Through GameSense, we empower our employees and customers to approach gambling the right way – for fun and entertainment,” Taylor added commenting on GameSense.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts Dedicates Considerable Efforts to Train Staff</p>
<p>MGM Resorts director of responsible gaming Garret Farnes said that the company has been able to stay at the forefront of responsible gambling practices by pooling its efforts into training members of the staff. He added:</p>
<p>Our employees serve as the front line for the company’s responsible gaming efforts, and we want them to be equipped with the skills needed to ensure guests are informed, confident, and in control of their play.</p>
<p>In 2021 alone, MGM Resorts managed to train 62,000 employees through GameSense, making the company one of the best-prepared entities out there committed to maintaining a high standard of customer protection and service.</p>
