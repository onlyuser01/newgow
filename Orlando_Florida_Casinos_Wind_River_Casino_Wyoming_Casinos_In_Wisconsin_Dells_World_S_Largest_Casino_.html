    <h1>Orlando Florida Casinos Wind River Casino Wyoming Casinos In Wisconsin Dells World S Largest Casino</h1>

<p>Can I ask you a question (no offence intended but I like good businesses)?</p>
<p>If you noticed in one of my complaints or reviews someone had commented Silveredge and Slots7 have the same owner.</p>
<p>I'm not stereotyping, but you know how good like North American/non-shady international or small or non-official type businesses tend to cause more issues and problems than ones like that? You'll also see stuff like more glitches on their websites (ie. put a space in the postal code and it creates an unusable account and wastes the email), typos "Imformation", less direct contact and fluent speakers, etc. It's like if you order "international" products on Amazon or Ali for like 10% the price, there's generally a reason.</p>
<p>It's not the international thing it's jthat there is a certain "standard" in good business and culture that is understood and expected in one subset vs the other. I think you understand where I'm going with this.</p>
<p>I don't want to sound like a douche but why is it like that? They're still people but it seems like they aren't very "smart". No offence. I notice this all the time. I don't think it's a language or policy thing regardless because a person is a person. If you look at any reputable, well-known business like an official legitimate in person NA casino, or let's say some big bank CIBC/RBC, or whatever business, these things NEVER happen. They alwaysssss cause issues these types I'm mentioning. I can also tell by speaking with you guys you're like the 2nd not the 1st type.</p>
<p>Is there a reason it's like that? Because I'm definitely right. I get fed up because I generally just have great experiences with the businesses I interact with on a day to day basis type thing. Super good customer service, fix issues asap, my thoughts are generally true and are validated since I'm not a moron and understand the differences between good and bad businesses, etc.</p>
<p>I just feel like (excuses my language) they must think people are like handicap or something to not realize they aren't "good" business.</p>
<p>I'll also notice differences between the two "types" I'm describing. The first like don't "get it"... basic concepts and don't even analyze 90% of the information or the point the customer is making.</p>
<p>Also, here's thinfo:</p>
