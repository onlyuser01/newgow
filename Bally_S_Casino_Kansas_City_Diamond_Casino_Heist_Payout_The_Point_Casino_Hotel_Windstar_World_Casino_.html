    <h1>Bally S Casino Kansas City Diamond Casino Heist Payout The Point Casino Hotel Windstar World Casino</h1>

<p>EveryMatrix tested the new solution extensively and found out that it prompts players to play and wager more</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s gamified solution JackpotEngine has been greenlit by the MGA. The approval will allow the company to add a configurable jackpot layer to any game under MGA jurisdiction. As a result, potentially hundreds of brands licensed by the Maltese authority will be able to implement the solution into their offerings.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix describes JackpotEngine as a complete Jackpot Management System that allows gambling companies to create, customize and manage their own jackpots. The best thing about the solution is that it is compatible with any selection of games across any casino vertical.</p>
<p>The seamless tool allows operators to boost customer engagement and inspire brand loyalty. Since longer play sessions provide more chances to win, JackpotEngine incentivizes players to continue playing with the same operator, boosting acquisition rates and improving operators’ profitability.</p>
<p>JackpotEngine Inspires Gamblers to Play More</p>
<p>EveryMatrix has tested JackpotEngine and has proven its capabilities to excite and entertain gambling customers. A comparison saw EveryMatrix examine the behavior of two players before and after they were assigned to a JackpotEngine-powered jackpot.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the solution inspired players to stay for longer, with one of the customers continuing to play for 25% more rounds and the other for 11% more rounds. In addition, the average wager of the two players climbed by 30% and 50% respectively.</p>
<p>JackpotEngine is designed to suit a variety of markets and has the option to turn off or tone down bonusing in markets with stricter regulations. It provides operators with full control over the games where a jackpot is offered, as well as the player segmentation, winning probability, seed amounts, winning cap, contribution distribution and the split of contribution funding between operators and players.</p>
<p>At the same time, JackpotEngine also has built-in real-time monitoring and reporting of jackpot transitions.</p>
<p>The Company Is Pleased to Have Secured MGA’s Approval</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s head of CasinoEngine, Stian Enger, commented on the new approval. He said that the testing his team has done shows that JackpotEngine is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to an immediate uplift in game rounds, session times and bet size. Because of that, he is convinced that the new solution will be a real game-changer.</p>
<p>I’m delighted with the MGA approval and this will significantly boost the product’s roll out in the months to come. Stian Enger, head of CasinoEngine, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Interested operators can onboard JackpotEngine through the company’s CasinoEngine division, or its B2B aggregation solution SlotMatrix.</p>
