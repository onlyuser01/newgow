<p>MGM Resorts International announced on May 1 that its subsidiary, LeoVegas, has agreed to acquire the majority of game developer Push Gaming Holding Limited and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Expands Content Production Capabilities with Acquisition of Push Gaming</p>
<p>Push Gaming is an industry-leading creator of digital games for betting and gaming companies, offering over 30 games to more than 200 operators globally. Push Gaming’s proprietary technologies, intellectual property, and development expertise will bolster the content production capabilities of LeoVegas and support its plans for continued growth through expansion.</p>
<p>As part of LeoVegas, Push Gaming will remain under the same management team, and its 100+ employees will continue to develop high-quality games, distributed via their platform and remote gaming server. The transaction is subject to regulatory and customary approvals and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>LeoVegas is a leading international iGaming company. It offers online casino, live casino, and sports betting via 10 brands in nine jurisdictions. LeoVegas continues to grow rapidly, currently employing over 1,000 people in Europe, including at its headquarters in Stockholm and operations hub in Malta.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International finalized its $607 million acquisition of the company back in August. The takeover bid had a price tag of $6.20 per LeoVegas share. MGM’s goal with the deal was to increase its profits and influence in the European market and accelerate the global growth of both brands.</p>
<p>Push Gaming Acquisition Aligns with MGM’s Vision for International Growth</p>
<p>Gary Fritz, President of MGM Resorts International Interactive, stated that the acquisition of Push Gaming by LeoVegas aligns with the company’s vision to expand MGM Resorts’ digital gaming presence internationally and to grow its capabilities and products over the next several years.</p>
<p>Fritz also noted: “We are pleased to bring Push Gaming into our business as it brings a track record of developing games that are popular and have staying power in the industry as well as an exceptional management and operating team.”</p>
<p>LeoVegas CEO Gustaf Hagman expressed his excitement in welcoming Push Gaming, noting that the management team at Push Gaming has had a phenomenal journey, quickly growing the company from a small start-up to a player with outstanding proprietary content and a strong customer base. Hagman stated that they look forward to contributing to Push Gaming’s continued success moving forward.</p>
<p>Founded in 2010, Push Gaming moved from land-based to online gaming in 2015, developing high-quality online slots such as Razor Shark, Wild Swarm, Big Bamboo, and Jammin Jars. The company’s distribution platform includes direct integrations with major gaming operators worldwide.</p>
