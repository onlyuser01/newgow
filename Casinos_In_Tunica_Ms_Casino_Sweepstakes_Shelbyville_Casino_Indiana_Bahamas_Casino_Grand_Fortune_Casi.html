    <h1>Casinos In Tunica Ms Casino Sweepstakes Shelbyville Casino Indiana Bahamas Casino Grand Fortune Casi</h1>

<p>To the casino guru team,</p>
<p>To all players who get lost here</p>
<p>Irish Luck Casino as well as all other casinos of this group like Two-up, bovegas, Domgame and golden lion offer a 50 euro no deposit bonus - the code for it can be found in emails you get from casino guru or right here on casino guru homepage.</p>
<p>This is a very questionable bonus – because although you have to wager the 50 euros 50 times, you can only withdraw 100 euros afterwards and the casino keeps the rest. In addition, this payout is linked to a deposit and you have to wager the deposit amount in the same way as with bonus money. (I have screenshot of live chat! Where this was written to me)</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed to do all this can look forward to a highly interesting verification. Of course, a selfie with your passport in hand is a must, but the real hit is – you will receive instructions by email and two links for downloading two forms that you have to fill out and sign.</p>
<p>You don't know whether to laugh or cry when you see that they tell you to take a picture of your credit card and hide some numbers and at the same time you have to write the complete number on the form. An upload is not possible, everything is sent by email - so much for the security of customer data!</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that everything would be done with that is wrong - I was told in the chat that you will then be called to complete the verification.</p>
<p>I've made screenshots of everything and I'm also uploading the forms I mentioned here so that you can see that everything is as I write it - I won't bother with Irish Luck anymore.</p>
<p>At this point I only ask myself one thing. How is the rating of such casinos done? What is rated? (no i don't need answers)</p>
<p>deposit methods? – there are casinos that offer up to 45 deposit and withdrawal methods. Casinos in this group only offer 7, with half of them not working. They do not make it technically through 3D security or are generally blocked by the bank from some countries. (can be found in online reviews)</p>
<p>Game selection or game provider? – I only found Rival games here</p>
<p>No complicated verification? - that shouldn't be the case either</p>
<p>Fast payout - ??? probably won't be either</p>
<p>These casinos are only available in English and so also in live chat</p>
<p>As you can see, I answered the questions I asked myself - no one needs to bother anymore.</p>
<p>So...that's it from me...I decided to donate the money I won to Irish Luck Casino...they should be happy with that...because I've gained a lot of knowledge and that's much more valuable</p>
<p>Take care</p>
