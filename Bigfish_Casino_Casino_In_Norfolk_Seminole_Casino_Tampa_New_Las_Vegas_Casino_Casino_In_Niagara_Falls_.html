<p>AGEM has appointed David Lucchese from Everi as its new president to help steer the non-profit trade group’s interests worldwide.</p>
<p>David Lucchese Takes Key Position at AGEM</p>
<p>Everi executive vice president of sales, marketing and digital, David Lucchese has stepped in as president of the Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers (AGEM) earlier this week.</p>
<p>The organization he will now help steer is an international non-profit trade group that represents the interests of suppliers and manufacturers of electronic gaming devices, table games, lotteries, and other components used in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>As a body, AGEM seeks to create more favorable business conditions for its members as well as break ground into new markets and defend and protect existing interests stakeholders may have in specific markets.</p>
<p>The trade group acts through political and regulatory influence as well as information and education sharing. Lucchese’s background makes him an ideal candidate and a perfect fit for this new position he will now take.</p>
<p>He has been with Everi since 2014 and held a job at Bally Technologies prior to that, giving him a well-rounded curriculum vitae, and the skills necessary to help advance the interests of member companies. Commenting on this event, Lucchese said he was delighted to be stepping in the position.</p>
<p>“I look forward to working with the entire AGEM leadership team and our member companies, maintaining the collaborative efforts which have served us well throughout the years.” -AGEM president David Lucchese</p>
<p>Lucchese said he would continue to make sure that the voices of AGEM are heard all over the world and in strategic markets for the organization. AGEM executive director Marcus Prater welcomed the latest executive to take the presidency, commending Lucchese on his vast experience in the industry and his understanding of the challenges that the sector faced together.</p>
<p>Emerging from the Pandemic Requires Innovation</p>
<p>Prater said that AGEM is prepared to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic even stronger under the guidance of Lucchese. The industry has been faced with numerous challenges during worldwide lockdowns, but this was not used up as a time to rue, but rather as a time to embrace innovation.</p>
<p>Everi Holdings used the opportunity to develop and roll out its digital wallets. The company struck a partnership for its CashClub Wallet with the Seminole Tribe in Florida and rolled out a full-scale CashClub Wallet solution available to all in late-December.</p>
<p>The majority of stakeholders have been looking for a cashless solution since early into the pandemic, trying to minimize physical contact at casinos. Recently, Aristocrat, Sightline and Boyd Gaming, signed a trilateral partnership to debut cashless technology.</p>
<p>The bid towards a cashless casino floor has been endorsed by the American Gaming Association (AGA) as well as other gaming trade bodies around the world.</p>
