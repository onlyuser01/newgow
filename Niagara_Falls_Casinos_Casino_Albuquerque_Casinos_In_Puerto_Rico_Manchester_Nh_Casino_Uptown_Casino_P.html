<p>Holbøll expressed her excitement about her return to Better Collective</p>
<p>Pernille Holbøll, Better Collective’s former group branding and media senior director, has returned to the company in a newly created position. The experienced appointee joins the leading digital sports media group as senior director of AI editorial content &amp; editorial innovation.</p>
<p>Holbøll’s first time as a member of the company was in 2022 when she joined the company as group branding and media senior director. Her time in this position was short, however, as in May, Holbøll departed from the company, later joining B.T. as executive editor-in-chief.</p>
<p>The new hire boasts an impressive track record in editorial positions. Prior to her first stint with Better Collective, she served as the editor-in-chief of Ekstra Bladet, a Danish tabloid newspaper. Before that, she also served as the managing editor of tv2.dk, a major Danish television channel.</p>
<p>As Better Collective’s new senior director of AI editorial content &amp; editorial innovation, Holbøll will head the development of AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Holbøll Is Happy to Return to Better Collective</p>
<p>Holbøll commented on her new role on LinkedIn, expressing her excitement about the opportunity to re-join Better Collective. She lauded the company as an up-and-coming and ambitious media group and said that she is “extremely happy” to be able to work with its team once again.</p>
<p>Holbøll noted that she has always been very impressed by Better Collective’s clear vision, reliable tech platform, robust management and experienced team. She also praised the company’s desire and ability to double down on its investments, M&amp;A activity and media development at a time when many companies are treading carefully.</p>
<p>Speaking of M&amp;A, Better Collective recently announced its intention to acquire Tipsbladet.dk in a $6.9M deal.</p>
<p>Holbøll said that she is confident that she can provide Better Collective with the experience it needs to develop its AI strategy. Keen on driving editorial innovation across the company’s media brands, Holbøll added that this was an opportunity she “certainly didn’t want to turn down.”</p>
<p>Holbøll concluded that she is joining Better Collective at a very exciting time, considering the upcoming Danish IPO.</p>
