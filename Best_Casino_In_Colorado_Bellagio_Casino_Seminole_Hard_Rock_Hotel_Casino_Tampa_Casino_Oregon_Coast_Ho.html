    <h1>Best Casino In Colorado Bellagio Casino Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Tampa Casino Oregon Coast Ho</h1>

<p>One of the gaming industry’s largest events, ICE London 2020, kicked off this week with NetGaming taking centre stage. The up-and-coming creative casino games studio solidified their presence in the main boulevard (Stand MS6) with their supercar-themed competition featuring a Porsche GT2 and Pagani Huayra.</p>
<p>The company welcomes all visitors to enter the competition so they can potentially bag themselves a high-octane driving experience. You can do this by simply sharing a picture of any NetGaming logo with ‘#NetGaming’ over one of the big four social media channels – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or LinkedIn.</p>

<p>NetGaming’s main stand is located over at Stand N1-413 where you can demo their entire portfolio, including their recent hit ‘Infinity Battle’. Additionally, the core team members are also available to answer any questions you may have over the three day event which is a great opportunity for you to find out more about their games and plans for the future.</p>
<p>Although relatively new on the scene, the company’s progress and attendance at ICE caps a successful period for the game supplier who have recently signed a series of high-profile distribution deals including the likes of Relax Gaming and Bet Construct. After speaking with the CEO of NetGaming, Pallavi Deshmukh, it seems that they are only heading upwards from here with plans for continual international expansion into several key markets in the near future.</p>
<p>ICE is the industry’s biggest event, and NetGaming stands ready to stake its claim as one of the most exciting providers on the market. With a catalogue of immersive slot titles, ambitious plans for international growth and a passionate team, we look forward to cultivating long-term commercial relationships. Pallavi Deshmukh, CEO at NetGaming</p>
<p>The NetGaming team has stated that they are on track to launch two branded games each year with the main theme for 2020 around ‘Supercars’ which is why they decided to showcase these two exciting vehicles at ICE this year. One thing we did notice was that ‘Pimp My Ride’ logos were displayed around the supercar stand, so we think this could be indicative of a potential partnership in the future.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to attend ICE London 2020, we encourage you to stop by the NetGaming stand (N1-413) to find out more about their upcoming plans and also enter the free competition for a chance to win an adrenaline-fueled driving experience.</p>
