<p>Twain Sport, a provider of live sport solutions, is further strengthening its position in the European market with STS, a brand based in Poland</p>
<p>The partnership is part of Twain Sport, which is a new live sport vertical created by Hybrid Sports League and BetGames, to expand in the Central and Eastern European markets.</p>
<p>T-basket to Send Ripples for STS in Poland</p>
<p>STS also stands to benefit from the opportunity, as it is now able to integrate hybrid sports products into its portfolio, all of which are linked to a high level of player engagement and overall positive sentiment.</p>
<p>Among the titles to launch on the market is T-basket which will now be offered exclusively by STS and bolster its own portfolio of esports, virtual sports, and sports betting products across the board.</p>
<p>STS has seen tremendous growth in its own operations over the past years. The company has multiplied its revenue tenfold and opened more than 400 betting shops across Poland. The company presently has offices in Warsaw and Katowice in Poland, but also in Prague, the Czech Republic, and Malta.</p>
<p>STS is confident that it can continue to grow its product and reach as it seeks to service millions of players in the targeted regions. Meanwhile, Twain Sport is confident in the success of the T-basket game which features 6,300 head-to-head basketball matches every month.</p>
<p>BetGames CEO Andreas Koeberl has welcomed the latest opportunity to expand the company’s product offer and said that Twain Sport has been highly successful since it launched in June 2022. The growth and popularity of the T-basket product have been undeniable. Koeberl added:</p>
<p>The potential of this partnership is significant and as STS becomes another of our highly valuable partners, we are delighted to award it exclusive Polish rights to both T-basket and our exciting upcoming release T-kick – two ground-breaking hybrid sports that we’re sure will perform strongly. BetGames CEO Andreas Koeberl</p>
<p>Twain Sport Set to Bring More Top-Tier Products</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by STS CEO and owner Mateusz Juroszek who similarly expressed confidence in the long-term success of the product and STS’s own place in the regulated Polish gambling market.</p>
<p>“One of our advantages is our own technology and the ability to easily implement the most attractive tools from the best suppliers,” Juroszek explained and added that the company was on the lookout to improve the customer journey through the addition of new and better in-play odds and features.</p>
<p>He further hailed the opportunity to add this first-of-a-kind product that brings additional value to businesses and bettors. Twain Sport’s success is undeniable, with the company planning the launch of another game, T-kick before long.</p>
<p>Twain Sport’s products are also backed by Sportradar’s Fraud Detection System to guarantee the fairness of all contests.</p>
