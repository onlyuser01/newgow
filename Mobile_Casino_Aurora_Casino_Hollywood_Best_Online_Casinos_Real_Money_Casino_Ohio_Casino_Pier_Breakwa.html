<p>A whistleblower who served in the US Air Force and in several intelligence roles claims that the US government has multiple spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin in its possession.</p>

<p>“The material includes intact and partially intact vehicles,” David Grusch told the journalistically sound NewsNation website earlier this week, noting that the vehicles were analyzed and determined to be from “nonhuman intelligence, whether extraterrestrial or unknown origin.”</p>
<p>Grusch is a former member of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and is the National Reconnaissance Office’s representative to the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Task Force, a group established by the Department of Defense in 2020 and led by the US Navy. UAP is the new government term for UFO.</p>
<p>The mission of the UAP Task Force, according to the Department of Defense website, is “to detect, analyze, and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.”</p>
<p>According to Grusch, federal agents have been recovering extra-terrestrial vehicles from crash sites for decades and covering up their findings from the American public.</p>
<p>“There is a sophisticated disinformation campaign targeting the US populace, which is extremely unethical and immoral,” he said. And they’ve got more than just vehicles, Grusch claims.</p>
<p>Well, naturally, when you recover something that’s either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots and, believe it or not, as fantastical as that sounds, it’s true,” he told NewsNation.</p>
<p>Grusch admits he hasn’t seen the alleged craft or the extra-terrestrial bodies himself but that he has “spoken extensively with other intelligence officials who have,” according to NewsNation.</p>
<p>So Where’s the Evidence?</p>
<p>Grusch has so far made no mention of any location or locations where extra-terrestrial ships or visitors may be stored. However, as cliché as it sounds, one of the best guesses is Area 51, a top-secret Air Force base 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>All satellite photos of Area 51, like this one, were blocked from Google Earth prior to 2018. (Image: Google Earth)</p>
<p>In 1942, the US government opened the Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field on the dry bed of Groom Lake, which was hard as concrete. Protected by the Emigrant Valley’s imposing mountain ranges, which made unwanted visitation difficult, it was an ideal strip on which to secretly train bombers for World War II.</p>
<p>The origin of the name “Area 51” is unclear. It is believed to be from an Atomic Energy Commission numbering grid, though the numbers of the adjacent grid areas range only from 1-15. The CIA refers to it both as Groom Lake and Homey Airport, while the area has also been called Paradise Ranch, a euphemism concocted by Lockheed to lure its hesitant employees there. (Image: space.com)</p>
<p>Groom Lake also made an ideal site for testing secret aircraft since the airspace above it was already restricted following the opening of the adjacent Nevada Test Site in 1951 and since the land around it was not only restricted but radioactive. No one would want to go there.</p>
<p>In 1955, CIA director Richard Bissell, Jr. asked the Atomic Energy Commission to turn over this 60 square-mile portion of the test site so he could run it with Lockheed aircraft designer Kelly Johnson.</p>
<p>Within eight months, engineers at Groom Lake developed the Lockheed U-2 spy plane, which the Air Force deployed on spying missions to the USSR and Cuba. Other top-secret stealth aircraft developed there included the Lockheed A-12 in 1962, the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk in 1981, and the Northrop Tacit Blue in 1996.</p>
<p>Also among Area 51’s official functions is examining, testing, and reverse-engineering the tech found in recovered or captured foreign aircraft. In September 2017, Air Force Lt. Col. Eric Shultz, 44, was killed when his plane crashed at Area 51. The Air Force, which took control of the installation in 1978, wouldn’t reveal the type of aircraft, leading to speculation that it was a foreign jet obtained by the US.</p>
<p>Today, the base and the wider Nevada Test and Training Range complex are part of the Nevada National Security Site.</p>
<p>Government Cover-Up</p>
<p>For decades, the US insulted the intelligence of answer-seekers by claiming that Area 51 never existed. It even did so in response to 1997 lawsuits filed by five former Area 51 employees and two of their widows, who suffered health effects from the burning of toxic waste on the site with zero oversight or protections.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until August 2013 that the federal government finally and formally acknowledged the existence of Area 51. It was forced to after the National Security Archive at George Washington University obtained a formerly classified CIA report chronicling the history of the U-2 spyplane through a 2005 Freedom of Information Act request. A heavily redacted version of the report was released in 1998, which didn’t identify the facility. This document explained the cover-up by emphasizing the need for strict secrecy to ward off Soviet interference during the Cold War.</p>
<p>The denial of Area 51’s existence was patently absurd and seriously eroded America’s trust in its representative government. Though satellite views of the base were blocked until 2018, pictures of it taken from a nearby mountain were widely available.</p>

<p>Every day for decades, the civilians who work at the facility — as many as 1,500 individuals with the highest possible security clearance — have boarded one of a fleet of unmarked 737 passenger jets that fly out of Las Vegas Airport under the call sign “Janet.”</p>
<p>And those who drive down the unmarked dirt road between mile markers 29 and 30 on State Route 375 (named The Extraterrestrial Highway in 1996), ignoring the 12 miles of signs warning “restricted area” and “use of deadly force authorized,” always find themselves staring down heavily armed guards who instruct them to turn around or be arrested.</p>
<p>‘Men in Black’: Based on a True Story?</p>
<p>For decades, fast-moving lights and weird shapes were sighted above the base at night, hovering and exhibiting other un-airplane-like behavior.</p>
<p>NASA and other government agencies repeatedly insisted that no credible evidence ever existed of extraterrestrial visitation, attributing most sightings to natural phenomena or human-made objects.</p>

<p>The initial reports over Area 51 were attributed to the U-2 spy plane, which flew higher than any other aircraft at the time, (up to 70K feet), to evade radar detection. As such, according to the CIA report released in 2013, the U-2 was reported as a UFO by multiple commercial airline pilots to whom it seemed alien.</p>
<p>On June 17, 1959, the Reno Evening Gazette published a story headlined “More Flying Objects Seen In Clark Sky,” in which Sgt. Wayne Anderson of the local sheriff’s office described seeing an object that was “bright green in color and descending toward the earth at a speed too great to be an airplane.”</p>
<p>The Air Force is claimed to have begun investigating claims of UFO sightings in 1947, the same year something crashed near Roswell, New Mexico that it claimed was a weather balloon. That was the first lie the US government told about a suspected UFO, and it wasn’t until 1995 that it amended its story. The wreckage, it claimed, came from a top-secret spy balloon being tested for a run into the USSR.</p>
<p>By the time Project Blue Book, as it was renamed in 1952, ended in 1969, the Air Force claimed to have investigated more than 12K UFO claims.</p>
<p>The Truth Was Out There</p>
<p>In more recent years, footage taken of multiple engagements with unidentified UAPs, released officially by the US Navy and not some anonymous YouTuber, clearly shows objects that can’t be easily explained away.</p>
<p>In a 2014 clip, a Navy Super Hornet pilot was shown nearly colliding with a UAP off the coast of Virginia Beach, Va. And footage of two Navy pilots, one year later, shows them tracking an impossibly maneuvering craft.</p>
<p>“Wow! What is that, man?” one of the pilots shouted. “Look at that flying!”</p>

<p>In what has come to be known as the “Tic Tac” video, an object resembling the famous mint was shown ping-ponging above the coast of California in footage that was published in 2017, by both the New York Times and the Washington Post, and later verified by the Navy.</p>
<p>Not the First</p>
<p>Grusch’s claim is also backed by reports from others. They include a defense contractor who, according to a 2020 New York Times report, briefed Defense Department officials on vehicles he observed that were “not made on this Earth.”</p>
<p>In 1989, KLAS-TV/Las Vegas broadcast an interview with a man, later identified as Bob Lazar, an equipment contractor, who alleged that he was hired to reverse-engineer extraterrestrial tech near Area 51. Lazar claimed he studied a craft that uses anti-gravity technology “that does not exist at all.”</p>
<p>Lazar was later reported to have misrepresented not only his master’s degrees in physics from MIT and in electronics from Caltech, but also his employment history, so his testimony was promptly dismissed by skeptics.</p>
<p>Most astrophysicists and cosmologists believe that extra-terrestrial life is almost certain to exist. Their issue has been why they haven’t been able to detect their radio transmissions or other signs of their existence, not to mention the impossible-to-traverse distances, at least according to our current technology, between star systems where intelligent life would be likely to have evolved.</p>
<p>Millions of intelligent Americans not only believe that contact with extra-terrestrials has been made, but that the remains of aliens and their spacecraft are being secretly held by the government.</p>
