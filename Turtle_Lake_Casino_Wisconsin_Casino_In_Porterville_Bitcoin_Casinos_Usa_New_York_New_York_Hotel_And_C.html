<p>Roar Digital, the joint venture between UK-based GVC Holdings and Las Vegas casino operator MGM Resorts, announced today it entered into a partnership deal with the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde in Oregon, to become their exclusive sports betting partner.</p>
<p>Spirit Mountain Casino Will Have BetMGM Sportsbook</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Roar Digital will open a BetMGM Sportsbook at Spirit Mountain Casino, Oregon’s premier destination for gaming and entertainment that is owned and operated by the Tribes, as well as roll out on-reservation mobile sports betting app that would eventually become state-wide, pending regulatory approval.</p>
<p>The operator of 13 retails sportsbooks under its BetMGM brand across Nevada, Mississippi, Michigan and New Jersey, was looking to enter the Oregon market and the largest casino in the state provided the perfect platform for Roar Digital to announce its arrival.</p>
<p>“We have found a great partner in the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde and Spirit Mountain Casino and look forward to working with the Tribe to bring a leading retail and online sports betting experience to Oregon.” Adam Greenblatt, CEO, ROAR Digital</p>
<p>Partnership with Roar Digital which recently went live in Colorado partnering Triple Crown’s Midnight Rose Hotel &amp; Casino in Cripple Creek, represented an option for the casino to get further player engagement through two of the most popular brands in the industry.</p>
<p>“This joint venture between two of the gaming industry’s most recognizable brands will bring a world class sports betting offering to Oregon. We’re excited to launch this partnership with BetMGM, which will allow us to extend our established position as the Northwest’s premier entertainment destination.” Stan Dillon, General Manager, Spirit Mountain Casino</p>
<p>Oregon became the 12th state to legalize sports betting and only the 8th with a state-wide mobile platform. It did not require state legislature to pass additional laws or the state governor to amend the existing tribal compact, as the state already had a law in place permitting some forms of sports betting.</p>
<p>Despite the legal status of wagering on sports events, options for placing bets are limited to the Oregon Lottery’s Scoreboard app, powered by technology company SBTech and launched in mid-October, and the physical sportsbook inside the Chinook Winds tribal casino, which opened in August 2019.</p>
