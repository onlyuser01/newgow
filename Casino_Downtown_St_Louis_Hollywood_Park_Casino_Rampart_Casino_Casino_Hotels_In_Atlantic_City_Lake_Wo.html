<p>Inspired Entertainment breaks into Canadian market</p>
<p>Loto-Québec to benefit from the company’s Plug N Play offer</p>
<p>More slot and table games arriving to Québec</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainmentwill bring its on-demand virtual sport Plug N Play platform along with casino table and slot games to Loto-Québec.</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment Enters Quebec’s Lottery</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment is entering Canada with a landmark deal with Loto-Québec, the Canadian provincial lottery operator. This is a big opportunity for the software supplier which will now provide on-demand virtual sports and casino games to the lottery, one of the few bodies in Canada to be authorized to run gaming products.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Loto-Québec will have a full access to the supplier’s iGaming products, including slots, table games and virtual sports on-demand, the latest trend in the world of gaming. All games will be accessible at LotoQuebec.com, the operator’s official website.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud to be nominated for the Multi-Channel Supplier and Virtual Sports Supplier of the year awards at the @EGRIntel B2B Awards 2019 https://t.co/sqnsU5SfnA pic.twitter.com/PbMotYbVlv — Inspired Entertainment, Inc. (@Inspired_News) May 1, 2019</p>
<p>1st Down Slots, Maximums Soldier of Rome, Book of the Irish are all some of the titles that will be arriving on the digital skin of the lottery operator. Starting in August, Quebec residents would have access to the games provided by Inspired.</p>
<p>One of the highlights includes the Plug N Play virtual sports platform which will help reinforce Loto-Québec’s own offer. Plug N Play was debuted at ICE at the beginning of 2019. Here is what the provincial operator General Manager for E-Commerce, Julie Benoît, had to say:</p>
<p>“The addition of Inspired’s popular casino titles and a library of fresh on demand and scheduled virtual sports games boosts our portfolio and allows us to reach a wider audience. We’re excited to see continued growth as a result of this partnership.”</p>
<p>Inspired’s Brooks Pierce, CEO, explained that the integration with Loto-Québec was a huge success for the company and reinforcing its positions in North America as a whole. Mr Pierce had this to say about Loto-Québec:</p>
<p>“They have been at the forefront of Canadian gaming and we are delighted to partner with them to offer Loto-Québec players something unique and different than what they already have access to.”</p>
<p>The operator has been doing well with its annual results growing up by 3.9% for a total of $US2.15 billion as of the time of reporting. Canada remains segregated in terms of iGaming and sports betting potential, much like the United States.</p>
<p>In essence, each province in the country is open to decide whether sports betting, lotteries and iGaming is permissible on their territories, without any supervision from the central government.</p>
