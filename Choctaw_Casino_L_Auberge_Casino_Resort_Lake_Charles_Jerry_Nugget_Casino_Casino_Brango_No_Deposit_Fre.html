<p>2021 Was a Successful Year for FansUnite</p>
<p>The company outlined that in 2021 it had set multiple strategic global milestones. Proudly, FansUnite said that it has hit and surpassed those goals. According to the company, growing within the US gambling market was a prime focus during this year. Moreover, FansUnite explained that expanding further into the US landscape remains a part of its strategic plan for next year.</p>
<p>“At the beginning of 2021, FansUnite set out multiple strategic milestones for the year in pursuit of becoming a preeminent gaming solutions provider in the global betting industry. We are proud to say we have hit and surpassed those goals,” reads FansUnite’s annual shareholder letter</p>
<p>In 2021, FansUnite inked multiple key deals within the US market. The company joined forces with OneComply, which is a compliance and licensing solutions provider. Additionally, FansUnite engaged with the independent industry-leading iGaming testing laboratory, Gaming Laboratories International (GLI).</p>
<p>“I’d like to reiterate that our mission is to become a leading global provider of gaming solutions.” Scott Burton, CEO at FansUnite</p>

In conclusion, Burton thanked the shareholders and said that FansUnite is looking “forward to another transformative year in 2022.”</p>
<p>American Affiliate Acquisition Boosts the Company’s US Expansion</p>
<p>Boosting its US expansion plans, FansUnite acquired the leading US betting affiliate company American Affiliate. According to the recent annual shareholder letter, the acquisition helped by rapidly accelerating FansUnite’s expansion in the US. As a part of the acquisition, FansUnite acquired one of the top US live activation sports betting and online gambling companies, Betting Hero.</p>
<p>“American Affiliate strengthens our operations, provides us with immediate and substantial access into the US betting market, and delivers an influx of senior-level leadership to the Company,” reads FansUnite’s annual shareholder letter</p>
<p>Moreover, the acquisition brought FansUnite partnerships with major industry players such as DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, and PointsBet to name a few. FansUnite explained that the acquisition also brought “150,000 new depositing customers for legal US online betting operators” as well as “trailing 12-month unaudited revenue and EBITDA of $13.1 million and $6.0 million respectively.”</p>
<p>FansUnite Continues Its Global Expansion</p>
<p>US market aside, FansUnite remained focused on expanding in Canada as well. According to the company, the passing of Bill C-218, enabling single-event wagering in Canada created “a lucrative, untapped domestic gambling market with a strong appetite for online betting.”</p>
<p>In the UK, FansUnite received a remote betting license and a remote gambling software license from the country’s regulator. Thanks to those licenses the company will be able to offer its B2B wagering platforms for UK casino operators and sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, FansUnite launched its Brazilian esports betting platform VamosGG. The company was able to secure exclusive rights for the sportsbook to offer both pre-match and in-play betting in Brazil for the PGL Major 2021 in Stockholm, Sweden. This helped the company grow significantly in the South American region and in the first week, VamosGG recorded 6,500 new players registering.</p>
