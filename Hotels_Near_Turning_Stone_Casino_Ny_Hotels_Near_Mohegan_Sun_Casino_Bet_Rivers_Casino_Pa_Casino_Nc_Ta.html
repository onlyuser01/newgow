<p>Arthur has years of experience, 3 continental relocations, 1 FBI shutdown and “countless amazing experiences” behind his back</p>
<p>Hard Rock Digital, Hard Rock’s online casino and sports betting arm, has welcomed a new addition to its team. The one to join the company at this time is Martin Graham Arthur who will serve as the company’s new director of product operations.</p>
<p>Joining a team of new and familiar faces, Arthur will now be responsible for managing the product team and improving the company’s offering. To that end, the new hire will leverage years of experience in the gambling sector.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Digital’s new director of operations boasts an impressive track record. He has worked within the gaming industry for over a decade and has served a number of notable companies.</p>
<p>Arthur’s career started in 2008 when he joined PokerStars as payment analyst. After almost two years, he was promoted as payment services manager and then product manager. In 2014, Arthur became PokerStars’ senior product manager – a position he held for over two years and a half.</p>
<p>Following that, Arthur became an associate director of product &amp; program management for The Stars Group’s sports division. After almost three years in that position, Arthur saw The Stars Group acquired by the Irish gambling giant Flutter Entertainment. At that point, Arthur was appointed as Flutter’s vice president of product &amp; program management for the US market.</p>
<p>As Hard Rock Digital’s new director of product operations, Arthur will leverage almost 15 years of industry experience and many years of product experience to bolster the operator’s business.</p>
<p>An Exciting New Chapter for Arthur</p>
<p>Arthur commented on his new appointment on LinkedIn, sharing an old photo. He reminisced about his arrival in London in 2008 and how he got his first “real job” at a company he hadn’t even heard of.</p>
<p>Now, Arthur has years of experience, 3 continental relocations, 1 FBI shutdown and “countless amazing experiences” behind his back. He thanked everyone who made his time with PokerStars/Amaya/The Stars Group/Flutter special.</p>
<p>I can’t name everyone who made this time special as there are too many, so I’ll just say thank you to all. So much in my life today that I am thankful for and appreciate traces back to this journey. Martin Graham Arthur, director of product operations, Hard Rock Digital</p>
<p>Arthur added that he is very excited about the new opportunities awaiting him as a member of the Hard Rock family.</p>
<p>Now, I am incredibly excited to be taking on a new challenge with Hard Rock Digital as Director of Product Operations. Ready to rock with some familiar faces and a talented team! Martin Graham Arthur, director of product operations, Hard Rock Digital</p>
<p>In August, Hard Rock launched its Hard Rock Bet brand in New Jersey.</p>
