<p>Hi, generally speaking, I believe that even though the provider can be restricted, it's always casino's responsibility to make sure that you can't play the games in their casino. When they allow this to you, it may be a part of their business strategy.</p>
<p>They can simply decide to take the risk and allow the games in countries where their competitors (other casinos) restrict them. In such cases, all winnings should be paid out and losses should be taken as fair losses.</p>
<p>Of course, you can't accept players losses, but refuse to pay winnings due to country restrictions. From our point of view, the most important part of the gambling is its fairness. Whenever a player deposits and loses money, they should always have a chance to win as well.</p>
