    <h1>Barona Casino Minnesota Casino Lake Tahoe Casino Sunland Park Racetrack Casino Red Rock Casino Resor</h1>

<p>I have been playing in the casino intense casino until I checked what are their sister sites to be shocked that I was a self excluded member of few of them.</p>
<p>I contacted casino intense and this is what I have written.</p>
<p>(Upon checking the list of your sister sites I found out that Iâ€™m self excluded of some of them with gambling issues.</p>
<p>Why did you let me register without blocking me and even you have been contacting the start of the registration to deposit and the agent asking me what kind of bonuses I like for them to offer me to just male me play more.</p>
<p>I would like to file a formal complaint for all my deposits and will do all the necessary to not let other people fall into your trap even self excluded.)</p>
<p>to be surprised with their reply that it is normal to send bonuses and promotions even though You mentioned the self exclusion,so it is a clear confession that they do tempt self excluded people with promotions to deposit?but then when it comes to the withdrawal of a winning will shock you with a block.</p>
<p>this is their reply to me:</p>
<p>(hello Mouna</p>
<p>i have checked your account and you are registered here since 2020 , the account now was closed as per your request few days ago , it is normal to receive benefits and promotions because this is an online casino and we do offer promotions</p>
<p>we are sorry that your experience with us was not good</p>
<p>best regards</p>
<p>casino intense</p>
<p>Account).</p>
<p>I do request a full refund to all my deposits with them as they did a breach and they are standing by it.</p>
