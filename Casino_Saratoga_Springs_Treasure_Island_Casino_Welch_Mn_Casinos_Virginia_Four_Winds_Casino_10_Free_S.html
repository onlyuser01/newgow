    <h1>Casino Saratoga Springs Treasure Island Casino Welch Mn Casinos Virginia Four Winds Casino 10 Free S</h1>

<p>On July 5th I won $3000.00 on a slot from Posh Casino. I played a little bit longer then decided I was going to make a Bitcoin Withdrawl. The maximum I was allowed to withdraw was $2500.00 to my Bitcoin wallet which was fine. I followed all the instructions for the withdrawal and waited. On the same day, I received an email from them asking for the usual verification documents, which I immediately uploaded to them. On the 7th of July, I saw on my profile page that they accepted all my paperwork and approved the withdrawal. I waited 10 business days and still had not received my winnings in my wallet so I went and emailed them. No response. So I went to the site and messaged the live customer service to which the very rude agent replied and told me it was going to be another 10 business days before I was going to see it in my wallet. So I waited the 10 business days. My 2500 was still not in my Bitcoin wallet. So I double-checked that my wallet address was correct which it was so I went to email them again. Still no response. So I emailed them AGAIN and still silence from them other than the standard email back that tells me they have received my email. I attempted to contact a live agent but was met with a super long wait time so I gave up on that. I feel like I'm being ghosted by them. The live agent I spoke with that one time was really rude and was no help at all and the fact that I have not been given some kind of email back from someone at least explaining what the hell is taking so long or some kind of explanation or a time table or something, anything, really just pisses me off. It's been almost a month since my first email there is no excuse at all for them to have not at least responded to me by now. If there are issues, great I get it, but a frickin response back would've been the smart thing to do. Now here I am left with questions and wondering if I'm even going to ever see that money in my wallet. I realize for new customers to withdraw at a casino it takes time but the fact they can't return a simple email to me makes me really uneasy about them and a lot pissed off! Anything you can do in this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>
