<p>Boston Celtics Want to Keep Their Good Run Going</p>
<p>After going down 3-0, the Boston Celtics really switched to top gear. They destroyed the Heat 116-99 in Game 4 in Miami. Then, the series went to Boston, where they won again. This time, it was 110-97 on the scoreline.</p>
<p>Jayson Tatum was their standout player in all of those games, but what’s interesting is that the Celtics really looked like a collective on the court. They did brilliantly both in offense and defense.</p>
<p>Another proof of Boston’s great team play is that in Game 5, the Celtics had four different players score 20+ points. Meanwhile, none of Miami’s players went over 20. It’s not just that they seemed out of focus, but they really couldn’t do much with Boston’s players being super-busy when defending.</p>
<p>Tatum recorded eight defensive rebounds; Al Horford had just two fewer. Then, there’s Marcus Smart who made five steals.</p>
<p>It’s Now or Never for the Miami Heat</p>
<p>The Heat blew up two shots at the Eastern Conference title already. They’ve got another chance this Saturday, but their confidence probably isn’t at a top level. On the bright side, they’ll have their fans at Kaseya Center to cheer them on.</p>
<p>The last time they played there, they lost to Boston, but they did win Game 3 there. Actually, they demolished the Celtics in that game 128-102. Gabe Vincent was brilliant in that game, but the Heat guard is currently struggling with an ankle injury and is uncertain about Saturday’s game.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the Heat’s roster is packed with amazing players, even though they weren’t great in the last two games. Jimmy Butler, for instance, had a very quiet game on Thursday, scoring just 14 points – his worst number in 20 games.</p>
<p>Miami’s center Bam Adebayo was also fairly disappointing in the last couple of games, failing to record double-figure rebounds, which are his speciality. If the Heat are going to make it 4-2, all of the aforementioned players will have to step up.</p>
<p>Celtics vs Heat Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be one very close game, which can go either way. In fact, we think the winner will win by just a couple of points. We also think there won’t be too many points in total, so “under” should hit easily.</p>
<p>Picks: Miami Heat +2.5; under 211 points</p>
