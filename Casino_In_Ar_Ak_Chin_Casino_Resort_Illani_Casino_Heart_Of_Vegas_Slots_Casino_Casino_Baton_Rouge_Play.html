    <h1>Casino In Ar Ak Chin Casino Resort Illani Casino Heart Of Vegas Slots Casino Casino Baton Rouge Play</h1>

<p>The iGaming developer’s substantial focus on North America is bearing fruit as operators in Connecticut will soon be able to take advantage of the company’s award-winning portfolio. The Play’n GO management team has adjusted its strategy to reflect the current challenges and provide partners with engaging quality content focused on bolstering retention.</p>
<p>The Company Is Taking the USA by Storm</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s most recent US success is a significant milestone in its regional ambitions. With its newly obtained Connecticut license, the developer successfully consolidated its footprint, laying the groundwork for future growth. December’s launch in West Virginia successfully bolstered Play’n GO’s presence on both sides of the border after the earlier expansion in Ontario.</p>
<p>Thanks to its most recent expansion, the supplier has access to five regulated markets across North America. Play’n GO chief commercial officer Magnus Olsson was excited about the newest launch, expressing hope that operators in the Constitution State would soon benefit from the developer’s engaging content.</p>
<p>Gaining further market access to US iGaming States has been an important goal of the company, so it’s fantastic to be able to add Connecticut to our US push. Magnus Olsson, Play’n GO chief commercial officer</p>
<p>The new Connecticut license means that Play’n GO products are available in over 25 regulated jurisdictions. Despite the company’s North American focus, it has not ignored its core European markets. In January, the supplier made another cornerstone achievement after an agreement with Kindred-owned brand 32Red, strengthening its position in the critical UK market.</p>
<p>Partners Can Enjoy a Dynamic and Engaging Portfolio</p>
<p>As one of the leading iGaming developers, Play’n GO maintains a healthy release schedule of new titles. In 2023, the company plans to release over 50 new products, bolstering its already impressive portfolio. Their latest slot game, Colt Lightning, launched only two weeks ago, featuring electric and innovative features and pleasant aesthetics.</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s busy release schedule feeds directly into its strategy to adapt to the unique challenges faced by the iGaming industry in the region. According to Olsson, acquisition costs in the USA were very costly, leading operators to focus on retention strategies. He added that Play’n GO’s proven track record of success would help attract many new partners.</p>
<p>Being able to bring Play’n GO games to Connecticut – the best content in the industry for retention – will be music to the ears of operators and their players. Magnus Olsson, Play’n GO chief commercial officer</p>
<p>The Sweden-based developer’s self-proclaimed mission is to be “the best in every regulated market in the world.” While such a goal seems ambitious, Play’n GO certainly appears to be giving it its all. Despite its busy release schedule, the supplier maintains its reputation for quality and continues to capitalize on every expansion opportunity.</p>
