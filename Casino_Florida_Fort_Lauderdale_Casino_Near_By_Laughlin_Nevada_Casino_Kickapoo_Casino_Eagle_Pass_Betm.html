<p>German operator Merkur struck a deal with iGaming company Gaming Innovation Group Inc. (GiG) to implement the software developer’s latest affiliate compliance tools. The partnership will provide Merkur greater flexibility as the company expands in the diverse and strictly regulated European gambling sector.</p>
<p>Merkur Will Have Tighter Affiliate Control</p>
<p>The new agreement will provide Merkur access to GiG’s automated compliance solution. The software can be configured to work in multiple jurisdictions and actively scans web pages for any content which might violate regulatory guidelines. Operators can thus monitor their affiliates’ promotional content and quickly react to potential problems.</p>
<p>Merkur affiliate lead Martin Collins expressed hope that GiG Comply would aid the operator’s continued efforts to abide by Germany’s strict regulatory guidelines.</p>
<p>We aim to do (everything) right, especially when it comes to compliance. All our brands are operated by local licenses both on and offline and where we abide by the rules. Martin Collins, affiliate lead at Merkur</p>
<p>Collins also lauded GiG’s substantial industry knowledge, noting that the new strategic partnership was a great starting point for future cooperation as both parties could share industry insights on their specific market niche.</p>
<p>GiG Cements Itself in the European Market</p>
<p>The deal with Merkur marks a significant milestone in GiG’s expansion efforts as the German company is one of the largest operators to employ the software developer’s services. Jonas Warrer, GiG’s chief marketing officer, remarked that their solution would allow partners to actively pursue improved regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>We’re delighted to be able to ensure affiliates are fully aligned with their brand and responsible gaming requirements. Jonas Warrer, chief marketing officer at GiG</p>
<p>If GiG’s compliance software meets the operator’s expectations, this could lead to more widespread adoption of the software services provider’s other offerings. Novibet is another high-profile operator which recently signed a deal for the developer’s compliance solution. Combined with Merkur, the agreements cement GiG’s position as a leading provider for the European market.</p>
<p>The Developer Enjoys Strong Momentum</p>
<p>GiG also has large expansion ambitions both inside the old continent and overseas. The company recently partnered with online casino brand Luckiest.com and will assist the new iGaming operator’s international launch by supplying its suite of B2B software solutions.</p>
<p>The B2B developer also announced its plans to push towards a significant North American expansion as it announced the creation of a dedicated US hub. The brand continues to invest substantially in the region, aiming to transfer its growing European reputation overseas and attract more high-profile partners and sports betting operators.</p>
<p>The expansion efforts are fueled by strong momentum as the company recorded an impressive 37% Q2 increase in revenue compared to 2021. GiG already services nearly 60 live brands, and if the company’s recent actions are any indicator, it has no plans to slow down soon.</p>
