<p>After it was temporarily impacted by the unprecedented cyberattack against MGM Resorts, the Borgata Poker Mini-Series were rescheduled to November. The cyberattack against the leading gaming and entertainment company impacted its retail operations, including the ones at Borgata Atlantic City. Moreover, the hackers’ attack impacted the BetMGM rewards website.</p>
<p>Despite the cyberattack, Borgata has announced that it rescheduled the Borgata Poker Fall Mini-Series to November. The series of tournaments, featuring a total prize pool of the staggering $1 million in guarantees, are set to start from November 14. The poker tournaments are going to run through November 19, 2023.</p>
<p>According to Borgata, registering online via BetMGM starts on November 6, 2023. On the other hand, in-person registration at Borgata Atlantic City would also become available starting a week later on November 12, 2023.</p>
<p>Qualifiers for the Borgata Poker Fall Mini-Series start on Monday, November 13. Overall, there are five qualifiers that will run through November 16, 2023, with buy-ins between $75 and $450, granting a chance for poker players to secure a seat for the upcoming events.</p>
<p>A statement released by Borgata explains: “BEAT THE LINES: All Players registering through the BetMGM Poker App on or before Saturday, November 11 will be provided with exclusive Early Bird seat pick up starting Sunday, November 12, plus collectible BetMGM Poker swag. On-site registration opens Sunday, November 12 for all six Main Events. Tournament players will qualify for room discounts, while supplies last.”</p>
<p>Main Event Offers $500K Guaranteed Prize Pool</p>
<p>With six events there are guaranteed prize pools between $50,000 and the staggering $500,000, making the total $1 million in guarantees. Between November 14 and November 15, the NLH DeepStack Kickoff will be held, offering a $100,000 guaranteed prize pool. On the other hand, between November 17 and November 18 the NLH 1K Bounty is scheduled that also features a $100,000 guaranteed.</p>
<p>On November 18, the NLH Saturday series will take place with a $200,000 guaranteed prize pool while the NLH Survivor and the PLO NLH Mix, featuring $50,000 in guarantees each will take place on November 19.</p>
<p>The jewel of the upcoming Borgata Poker Fall Mini-Series is the NLH 8-Max Championship. Scheduled between November 15 and November 16, the $2,500 buy-in main event features a $500,000 guaranteed prize pool.</p>
<p>Back in mid-September, Borgata confirmed that the Borgata Fall Poker series was cancelled. The series was initially scheduled to run between September 26 and October 1. Borgata did not confirm the reason behind the cancellation at the time. However, it is likely that this was the result of the devastating cyberattack.</p>
