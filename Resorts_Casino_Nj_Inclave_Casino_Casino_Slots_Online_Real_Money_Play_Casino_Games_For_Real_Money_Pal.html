<p>The Udinese vs Napoli match on Thursday, May 4, 2023, is truly a historic event. If Napoli donâ€™t lose, theyâ€™re going to secure the Serie A title. They just need a single point to win their first Scudetto in 33 years</p>
<p>Local authorities in Naples are working hard to prepare the city for the title celebration. They expect real chaos on the streets if Napoli win the title on Thursday. In fact, they were expecting the Sky Blues to do it over the weekend at Estadio Diego Armando Maradona, but Salernitana ruined the party for them. As a result, their first title since the Maradona days could be won away from home. They just need to avoid losing to Udinese at Dacia Arena in Udine.</p>

<p>Can Udinese Postpone Napoliâ€™s Party?</p>
<p>Udinese are sitting in the No. 13 position in the Italian Serie A standings with 42 points. They just need a single point to make sure thereâ€™s no scenario in which they would drop into the relegation zone. At the same time, whatever happens in the remaining six Serie A rounds, they just cannot move up much higher in the table.</p>

<p>That said, the season is practically over for these guys, so they wonâ€™t be too motivated on Thursday. Plus, their recent form isnâ€™t great (4 points in the last five games), and they usually tend to fail against big favorites like Napoli.</p>
<p>In fact, they lost each of their six previous duels with Napoli. And the last time they welcomed the Sky Blues from Naples at Dacia Arena, the score was 4-0 for the visitors.</p>
<p>Napoli to Win the Serie A Title for the 1st Time in 33 Years</p>
<p>The whole city of Naples is preparing for the party. Their boys just need to collect one single point to secure the first Serie A title since 1990 when Diego Maradona was their captain. They had a chance to do so last weekend on their turf, but they ended up drawing with Salernitana 1-1.</p>

<p>It was a shocking turn of events, considering that Napoli entered the game as -560 favorites. Plus, they had a 1-0 lead until the 86th minute when Salernitanaâ€™s Boulaye Dia silenced the crowd at Estadio Diego Armando Maradona.</p>
<p>The result is that now Napoliâ€™s fans will have to travel to the North of Italy to celebrate with the players. Of course, thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re hoping is going to happen on Thursday. But maybe weâ€™re going to witness another surprise?</p>
<p>Udinese vs Napoli Prediction</p>
<p>This is Napoliâ€™s title game. They already had one shot at the trophy, but they blew it. We honestly doubt theyâ€™re going to do the same again. In fact, we think just the opposite will happen â€“ theyâ€™re going to destroy Udinese on Thursday, after which the party can start in two cities â€“ Udine and Naples.</p>
<p>Pick: Napoli to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
