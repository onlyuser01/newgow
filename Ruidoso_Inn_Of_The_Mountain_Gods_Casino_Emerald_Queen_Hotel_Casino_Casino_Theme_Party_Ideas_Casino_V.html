<p>Matthew Anfinson has been appointed the new CEO at Great Canadian Entertainment and he will be succeeding Anthony Rodio, the outgoing incumbent. He is being promoted from the position of the chief operating officer. Great Canadian has used the retirement of Rodio to also appoint Jordan Banks as the company’s first executive chairperson.</p>
<p>A Welcomed Hire and Much Appreciation for Rodio</p>
<p>Alex Van Hoek, who is the chairperson of the board at Great Canadian and partner at Apollo, also added:</p>
<p>On behalf of the Board of Directors, the management team and Great Canadian’s team members, we want to thank Tony for his outstanding leadership. Alex Van Hoek</p>
<p>Van Hoek paid his compliments to Rodio who has been crucial to the company’s success in navigating one of the most trying times for it – the pandemic. He has helped put Great Canadian back on the road to recovery and growth despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Anfinson was similarly pleased with the opportunity:</p>
<p>It is an enormous privilege to lead Great Canadian Entertainment, especially at this defining juncture of the company as we set a new industry standard for gaming and entertainment in Canada. Great Canadian Gaming incoming CEO Matthew Anfinson</p>
<p>Rodio’s work at the helm is appreciated by the company’s guests and team members, and will be appreciated for the years to come, Van Hoek said, and also used the opportunity to welcome Anfinson:</p>
<p>We are also pleased to name Matthew as CEO, whom we are excited to have lead Great Canadian in its next chapter. Matthew is a North American leader in our industry with a deep understanding of the business. Alex Van Hoek</p>
<p>Anfinson’s contributions are also important, the executive said and noted that he has been responsible for the growth of all of the company’s 25 properties. Anfinson’s experience is not only limited to Great Canadian, though, as he has served in various similar positions across the gambling industry. He was SVP of Operations and Caesars Entertainment Corp in Las Vegas and held leadership positions with Harrah’s.</p>
<p>Anfinson is confident about the future and has already promised that Great Canadian will be bringing to North America what can be considered the best casino resorts. Presently, the Pickering Casino Resort and Casino Woodbine are still being finalized. Anfinson is similarly stoked about the opportunity to drive more growth and work with local communities across the country.</p>
<p>“We remain focused on continuously enhancing the overall experience for our guests, delivering long-term growth and value creation for our stakeholders, and doing so in a socially responsible way,” Anfinson confirmed.</p>
