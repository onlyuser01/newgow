    <h1>Peppermill Casino Wendover Alhambra Casino Westgate Hotel And Casino Casinos South Lake Tahoe Casino</h1>

<p>Hey, and which site do you have in mind? Based on your complaint, I'd say it was about NANOGAMES.IO . ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
<p>I understand you feel angry, but I would like to ask you again whether any funds are being held by the casino?</p>
<p>I could not find it in your quite long latest reply, I'm sorry. You are just talking about theft and scams, but I'd say loyalty points or purely bonus money are not yours until fully converted into real funds, right?</p>
<p>Kindly be more concrete, preferably through the complaint: https://casino.guru/nanogames-io-casino-player-s-account-got-unfairly</p>
<p>As explained, any potential rewards or "loyalty points" are not considered real funds but rather bonus money.</p>
<p>Frankly, this point is also valid:</p>
<p>"Please understand, that we can‚Äôt penalize the casino for closing your account. Casinos, in general, have a right to restrict or even close players‚Äô accounts if they suspect irregular play or other questionable activities or for no reason at all. "</p>
<p>Additionally, per our own words: you know the US is blacklisted. You knew they operated without a license, yet you kept coming back until your account was banned, and now you're using it as an argument why the casino seems to be a scam. Well, why did you keep playing there? Would you complain if your account remained open?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I can't understand that.</p>
