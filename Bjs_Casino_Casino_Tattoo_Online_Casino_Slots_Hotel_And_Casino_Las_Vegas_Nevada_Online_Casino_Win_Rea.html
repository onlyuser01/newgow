<p>GeoLocs will help the lottery operator tackle the geolocation challenges it faces</p>
<p>Mkodo, a Pollard Banknote-owned supplier of mobile and front-end technology, has made a foray into the United States thanks to a partnership with the Arizona State Lottery. Under the agreement, the former company will supply the lottery operator with its robust geolocation tool, GeoLocs.</p>
<p>GeoLocs is a reliable geolocation service that Pollard Banknote and mkodo’s partners have been using for more than a decade. GeoLocs is notably designed to address the online casino industry’s needs and is therefore one of the best geolocation solutions in the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>Focused on the North American market, the solution helps clients tackle the geolocation challenges they face.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, GeoLocs will support the launch of the Arizona State Lottery’s new online sweepstakes platform, Lucky Lounge. The geolocation service will be seamlessly integrated into the platform and will help the lottery operator remain compliant.</p>
<p>This launch expands the existing relationship between Pollard and the Arizona State Lottery. Previously, the former company assisted the operator with the launch of the aforementioned Lucky Lounge platform.</p>
<p>The platform has experienced dramatic growth since its launch, prompting the need for a robust geolocation service.</p>
<p>GeoLocs Was the Perfect Choice for the Lottery Operator</p>
<p>The Arizona Lottery’s deputy director of marketing and products, Chris Rogers, commented on the new partnership, highlighting his team’s need for geolocation verification. He noted that GeoLocs seemed like the perfect choice for the lottery’s needs.</p>
<p>The technology and expertise behind GeoLocs, as well as the knowledge of regulations and compliance in the region, has been a fantastic support and is what made the GeoLocs offering stand out as we implement geolocation within our offering. Chris Rogers, deputy director of marketing and products, Arizona State Lottery</p>
<p>Mkodo’s managing director, Stuart Godfree, also commented on the matter, expressing his team’s delight about joining forces with the Arizona Lottery. He noted that mkodo is looking forward to helping the lottery operator ensure full compliance with Arizona’s geolocation regulations and supporting its sweepstakes platform.</p>
<p>Following its early 2023 launch, we’re pleased to further establish GeoLocs as a leading compliance provider in North America. We are excited to work with the Arizona Lottery to offer it and its players the best user experience for geolocation verification. Stuart Godfree, MD, mkodo</p>
<p>Earlier this year, mkodo also formed GeoLocs partnerships with other notable companies, including Rootz and Casumo.</p>
