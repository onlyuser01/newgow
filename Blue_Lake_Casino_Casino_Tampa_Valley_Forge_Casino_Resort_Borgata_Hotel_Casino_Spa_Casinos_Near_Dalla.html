<p>Los Angeles FC start their MLS Cup defense with a game against their intercity rivals, Los Angeles Galaxy. The game is played on Saturday, February 25, 2023</p>
<p>LAFC are the reigning MLS champions, but defending the title won’t be easy as several of their key players from the last season aren’t in the club anymore. How will they cope without Christian Bale and Cristian Arango? We’ll find out on Saturday when they play the Los Angeles Derby a.k.a. El Trafico.</p>

<p>Los Angeles Galaxy Always Show Up in El Trafico</p>
<p>Los Angeles Galaxy lead the all-time series in the LA Derby with 7 wins, 5 draws, and 5 losses. The last time they played against LAFC, they lost 3-2 in a super-tense game of the 2022 MLS Playoffs. The game saw them score the equalizer in the 85th minute, but then LAFC scored the winner in the 3rd minute of the stoppage time.</p>
<p>Obviously, they would love to exact their revenge for the loss, for which they’ll have the support of their fans at Dignity Health Sports Park. When they’re the hosts, they usually do very well in the Los Angeles Derby. In fact, they’re still undefeated at home against LAFC, with 6 wins and 2 draws.</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC Aren’t as Strong as Last Season</p>
<p>Gareth Bale was LAFC’s hero in the 2022 MLS Cup game when he scored the equalizer in the 8th minute of the stoppage time in the second period of extra time. The goal took the game to penalties, where his team did better than Philadelphia Union.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for LAFC, the Welshman decided the 2022 MLS Cup was going to be his final professional soccer match. Bale retired, but he’s not the only player LAFC will miss in 2023. They will also be without Cristian Arango, who was their scoring leader last season. The forward decided to move to Pachuca in the offseason.</p>
<p>They did, however, make a couple of interesting signings, but the question is whether they’ll start playing top soccer straight away.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Galaxy vs Los Angeles FC Prediction</p>
<p>LAFC once again have a better roster than their city rivals. However, their new players still probably haven’t clicked with the rest of the team, which is why we don’t expect them to start destroying opponents straight away. That said, Galaxy do stand a decent chance in the first El Trafico of 2023. We think they can win themselves at least one point on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pick: Galaxy and LAFC to draw</p>
