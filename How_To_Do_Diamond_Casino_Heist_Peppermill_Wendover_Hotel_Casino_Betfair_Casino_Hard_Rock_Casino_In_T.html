<p>Positive EBITDA despite the COVID 19 Restrictions</p>
<p>Robert G. Goldstein, chairman, and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands Corp., commented that the company managed to generate positive EBITDA at the Singapore-based Marina Bay Sands and for the entity generally, despite the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic-related limitations on the company’s financial results. He added that the company’s team was enthusiastic about the fact that they could receive more guests in the company’s resorts and properties due to the large number of visitors, who are now able to travel to Macau and Singapore. Las Vegas Sands Corp continues to be committed to supporting its team members and to helping those who are in need in their local communities, which recuperate from the COVID 19 pandemic’s impact.</p>
<p>Goldstein also stated that the company expected to continue with its future growth because of the ongoing investments in capacity expansion and improvement of the property portfolio in Singapore and Macau.</p>
<p>In February 2022, Las Vegas Sands Corp agreed to sell its Las Vegas properties, namely The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center, for approximately $6.25 billion to Apollo Global Management. The casino resort operator stated that it would focus on its Asia operations.</p>
