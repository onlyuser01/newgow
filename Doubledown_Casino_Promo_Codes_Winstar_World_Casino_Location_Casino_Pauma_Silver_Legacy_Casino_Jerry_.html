<p>Wazdan has inked a new agreement with WWin for Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, bringing more than 70 of its top titles to domestic players</p>
<p>Wazdan, the innovative provider of premium games that have gained compliance in over 20 global regulated markets has announced it would strengthen its foothold in the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>The new deal signed with domestic operator WWin in Bosnia and Herzegovina will introduce 72 of the studio’s best-received titles to domestic players, along with their flagship game mechanics and features.</p>
<p>Bosnia, a Market with “Incredibly Exciting Potential” for Wazdan</p>
<p>Wazdan’s chief commercial officer, Andrzej Hyla, spoke about the Bosnian market as one that is capable of offering “incredibly exciting potential” for them, expressing confidence in the potential of the agreement and eagerness to get started.</p>
<p>Hyla also expressed the company’s thrill for being able to introduce some of their best games to players here, along with the similarly iconic game features that give slot players unparalleled experiences.</p>
<p>Games like Power of Gods, 9 Coins, Larry the Leprechaun, and the Hot Slot series are just some of the options that Bosnians will be able to access thanks to this move.</p>
<p>Some of the provider’s flagship features including Sticky to Infinity, Hold the Jackpot, Cash Infinity, and the highly praised Volatility Levels alternative will all allow players to gain better control over their overall experiences.</p>
<p>The company with over a decade of experience in the industry and over 500 partnered casinos is no stranger to the region. Over the years, the studio signed a number of similar partnerships with neighboring countries.</p>
<p>In May, Wazdan partnered with 8888.bg, marking its fifth deal with a Bulgarian operator. In September, the provider teamed up with ExeFeed to launch in Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
<p>WWin to Enjoy Limited Exclusivity on the Content</p>
<p>Pin Projekt’s chief commercial officer, Ivan Grkovic, expressed joy in adding “Wazdan’s award-winning features and titles” to WWin’s portfolio via Pin Projekt. Grkovic also explained they will benefit from exclusivity on Wazdan’s content “for a specific period” which was not disclosed. This means the premium provider’s content will solely be available to WWin customers in the country.</p>
<p>The CCO called the agreement “an exciting time” for them to strengthen their position as the leaders in the Bosnian market for the last two decades due to their innovative approaches and strategic deals similar to the freshly-inked one.</p>
<p>Among the numerous awards and nominations scooped up by Wazdan over the years, we can mention the latest Game Feature of the Year title at the CasinoBeats Game Developer Awards, and the Best Slot Provider in the Nordics title during the BSG Awards in 2023 and the Innovator award at the SlotsWise Awards in 2022.</p>
