<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru .</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - stated in detail in the casino's post. It is the players' obligation to read and comply with the casino's rules, and you accepted them during registration. These rules, and standard rules governing KYC/verification in online casinos say that it is necessary to complete it in order to withdraw any winnings. Verification video call is a part of the KYC process, and unfortunately, you failed to pass it. Although some questions were answered correctly, there were too many basic casino account details and data for which you stated incorrect information. If there was no bonus used, and the winnings were accumulated only by playing slots using real money exclusively, it would have been a different situation. But that is not the case here. Since you failed to pass the KYC, the casino acted correctly and in accordance with its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I was provided with further details and evidence from the casino representative. Those only confirmed the casino's claims presented above and its decision.</p>
