<p>Lynn Gilmartin was presented with the special honour of being inducted into Australia’s Poker Hall of Game this week.</p>
<p>WPT Anchor Receives Hall of Fame Honour</p>
<p>Lynn Gilmartin has been inducted into the Australian Poker Hall of Fame this week. She was presented with the award by Joe Hachem, President of the Australian Poker All of Fame, and will be joining other legendary poker figures like Jeff Lisandro, Joe Cabret.</p>
<p>“The game of poker is impressively unique, and we have the rare gift of being surrounded by so many people with the dream-chasing courage and spirit which tournament poker brings. This award is a wonderful honor. I’m so very thankful.” – Lynn Gilmartin</p>
<p>About Lynn Gilmartin</p>
<p>Lynn Gilmartin was born in Ireland and moved Melbourne, Australia in 1986. She built a career as a television host for a wide range of productions, and got her start in the poker industry in 2013 when she hosted coverage of the WSOP Asia.</p>
<p>Eventually, Gilmartin moved to Los Angeles where she became the World Poker Tour’s anchor alongside commentators Mike Sexton and Vincent Van Patten. Around the same time, she took on the roles as anchor and producer for WPT Alpha8, the World Poker Tour’s high roller series.</p>
<p>Since then, she has become one of the most recognizable faces in the poker world. Whenever there is a World Poker Tour event on, it’s Gilmartin who will keep you up to date with all of the exciting action.</p>
<p>Most recently, however, she has been recognized outside of the poker world due to her fundraising efforts. Earlier this month, Gilmartin launched a fundraiser called Poker Players for Australian Wildlife, which has helped animals affected by the wildfires that have been raging across the country. So far, her initiative has raised $90,000 and helped a countless number animals, but her goal is to reach $100,000 in donations.</p>
<p>Kahle Burns Also Honoured</p>
<p>At the same ceremony, Kahle Burns was also inducted into the Australian Poker Hall of Fame. The 30-year-old has been playing professionally for twelve years, but really thrived in 2019. Over the course of the last year, Burns managed to snag two World Series of Poker bracelets – which is something that even the most talented to poker players would struggle to do.</p>
<p>His total tournament winnings are now worth over $8 million. Kahle is now second on Australia’s All-Time Money List – just over $4 million behind Joe Hachem. He’s still quite young in his poker career, though, so there’s plenty of time for him to take off into the lead and gain legendary status in the country’s Poker Hall of Fame.</p>
