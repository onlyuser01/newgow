<p>White Hat Studios continues to pursue growth in the US iGaming market as the company has now added games by Galaxy Gaming to its library of games. Through this content alliance, White Hat Studios is expanding its reach in the table games vertical which Galaxy Gaming specializes in.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios Adds More Worthwhile Blackjack Content</p>
<p>As a result, players who use White Hat Studios’ product offering will also have access to existing and upcoming releases such as Blackjack Player’s Choice. A big focus of the portfolio is focused on the blackjack experience as provided by Galaxy Gaming with the help of White Hat Studios.</p>
<p>Some of the most worthwhile titles will now be made available with 21+3, Perfect Pairs, Lucky Ladies, Buster Blackjack, Suit’em Up, and Lucky Lucky all available player choices. Galaxy Gaming processes more than 1.2 billion wagers on its Blackjack side bet games through both online and brick-and-mortar casinos, making it one of the most successful distributors and developers of such games.</p>
<p>The table games addition will improve White Hat Studios’ unique portfolio and ensure that the studio remains a preferred choice as it breaks new ground in the regulated US market. This comes amid calls from industry heavyweights, including DraftKings CEO and co-founder Jason Robins for lawmakers to act and make sure they pass more laws that create opportunities for iGaming.</p>
<p>Executives Pleased with Current Developments for US</p>
<p>Commenting on this deal, White Hat Studios CEO Andy Whitworth welcomed the newest content tie-up and said that his company was thrilled to be joining efforts with Galaxy Gaming:</p>
<p>I’m really excited by our first title Blackjack Players Choice, which is actually a game I’ve wanted to build for years. It gives players true flexibility and choice by allowing them to select which of Galaxy’s side bets they wish to play. We have been blown away by positive operator feedback and are already building operator branded versions of the first game. White Hat Studios CEO Andy Whitworth</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming president and CEO Todd Cravens responded in kind and hailed White Hat Studios’ rapid expansion throughout US markets. He added that he was thrilled to work with White Hat on advancing iGaming content in the region and beyond. White Hat Studios was created last year after the company bought out Blueprint Gaming’s catalog.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios has been rapidly pushing for further expansion in the US. The company already has an iGaming partnership with DraftKings. White Hat Studios have made splashes in BetMGM and PlayEagle.com in Michigan.</p>
