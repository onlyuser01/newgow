<p>Gegard Mousasi Trying to Bounce Back After Losing the Title</p>
<p>For two years, Gegard Mousasi was the Bellator Middleweight World Champion. But then in summer 2022, Johnny Eblen beat him by a unanimous decision to take over the title. Almost a year later, Mousasi is coming back to fight again.</p>
<p>He’s turning 38 this summer, meaning that there’s not much time left for him to get back the title belt and retire as a champ. To get another shot at the title, he’ll need to remove Fabian Edwards from the equation on Friday evening.</p>
<p>So, can he do it? Well, he’s got experience on his side. Mousasi has been fighting professionally in the sport of the MMA since 2003. So far, he’s fought 59 bouts and his record is 49-9. He’s a well-rounded fighter who’s won 28 fights by KO/TKO, 12 by submission, and nine by decision.</p>
<p>His strongest weapon is striking but he’s also a very good wrestler and is pretty good in terms of takedown defense. Unfortunately for Mousasi, all this applies to his next opponent as well.</p>
<p>Fabian Edwards Could Be the Next Big Thing in Bellator MMA</p>
<p>This guy is 11-2 in his professional career, meaning that he’s got significantly less experience than Mousasi. However, the fact is that he was very impressive in all of those 13 fights. Yes, we’re talking about the ones that he lost as well.</p>
<p>Both of his losses happened after the final bell, with one being a split-decision defeat. When it comes to his wins, four happened by KO/TKO, three by submission, and four by decision.</p>
<p>His most notable win happened almost exactly one year ago when we saw him beat Lyoto Machida by KO in Round 1.</p>
<p>Gegard Mousasi vs Fabian Edwards Prediction</p>
<p>Fabian Edwards is a fine fighter with a great future ahead of him, but at this point, he just isn’t as good as Mousasi. That’s why anything but a win for Mousasi would be a huge upset in our eyes.</p>
<p>Pick: Gegard Mousasi to win</p>
