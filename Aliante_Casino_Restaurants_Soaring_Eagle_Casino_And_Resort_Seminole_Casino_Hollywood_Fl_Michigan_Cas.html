    <h1>Aliante Casino Restaurants Soaring Eagle Casino And Resort Seminole Casino Hollywood Fl Michigan Cas</h1>

<p>Kindred Group, the operator of the Unibet brand, continued its expansion in the U.S., entering Iowa and Indiana after signing an agreement with Caesars Entertainment to roll out sports betting and online gaming services for the casino operator in both states, subject to the passage of the respective laws and contingent on the necessary regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Online Gaming Services Dependent on Legislation</p>
<p>While both Iowa and Indiana have legalized sports betting and have live betting operations, the other gambling options that are part of the signed deal between the European gaming company and the casino operator will depend on those two states approving the necessary legislation.</p>
<p>Unibet Skins in Four U.S. States</p>
<p>Having previously entered New Jersey in September 2019, in a partnership deal with the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City where Unibet operates as one of three mobile skins, and a month later Pennsylvania, after an agreement with the Mohegan Sun Pocono, the latest move expands the U.S. presence of Kindred Group to four states.</p>
<p>“Caesars’ geographical spread in the US gives us a unique opportunity to build our footprint, with Indiana and Iowa next in line and potential other states lined up. We also share Caesars’ vision to offer customers an unforgettable experience where every guest is treated like a Caesar” Manuel Stan, SVP, Kindred US</p>
<p>One Eye On Turnover</p>
<p>New Jersey and Pennsylvania rank as the second- and third-largest markets for sports betting operations, with the latter recording in December $342.6 million of which $297.4 million online bets and, despite the relatively recent start of sports betting in Indiana, the market has quickly taken the fourth place in terms of monthly sports wagering revenue, recording in January $170.8 million of which $123.3 million online wagering.</p>
<p>Iowa has January sports betting revenue of $58 million, with $33.8 million online sports betting.</p>
<p>Kindred Group Responsible for Licensing</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Kindred Group will have to secure the required licenses for both Iowa, where Unibet will provide operations for the Harrah’s Council Bluffs Hotel &amp; Casino, and Indiana, where Kindred’s famous online brand will power a sports book and online gaming for the Horseshoe Hammond casino.</p>
<p>“As Caesars Entertainment continues to gain state approvals for legalized sports betting in the US, we look forward to adding Kindred to our list of sports betting partners in certain states” Christian Stuart, Executive Vice President, Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>Operations Will Launch Soon</p>
<p>Kindred Group will likely start Unibet operations first in Indiana, where they expect to launch by the beginning of the football season in the late summer, and then follow up in Iowa by the beginning of 2021 where the requirement for in-person registration for mobile sports betting before downloading mobile betting apps is expected to end.</p>
<p>The signed deal between Kindred Group and Caesars Entertainment will allow the European-based gaming company to operate skins in both states for 10 years.</p>
