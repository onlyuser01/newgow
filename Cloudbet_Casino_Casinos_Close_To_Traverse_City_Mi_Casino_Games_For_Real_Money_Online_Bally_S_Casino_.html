    <h1>Cloudbet Casino Casinos Close To Traverse City Mi Casino Games For Real Money Online Bally S Casino</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I accepted a match deposit bonus offer as a 6 month anniversary with Mirax Casino. I accepted the 2nd option of (code: 6MONTHS2) for a 100% bonus up to $100 and I deposited the maximum of $100. As per the website bonus terms and conditions it should have been 30x wager, $9 max bet per spin and no max win (as per all their bonuses). However, after depositing, I noticed I couldn’t bet above $1.60 and the wagering was 45x. These conditions however, only apply for a first deposit bonus of which I’d already used long ago (along with many other deposits since). I contacted chat and honestly, what a circus. They were pretty much "oh well I can’t change it now" but confirmed it was still a no max win (as per all their bonuses). Free spins are the only ones with win limits (of which I always avoid). The customer service was terrible and didn’t care nor apologise. I was supposed to be VIP also. Rather than give myself an aneurism, I wagered it patiently with the lower max bet. So, I finally got lucky (spent thousands here but no withdrawals) and won $1150. Once I’d completed wagering - my balance dropped to $200. I was not a happy Chappy. I now had to contact the same chat who went away for ages then said they’ll pass on to the relevant department. I never heard a word. I emailed a gazillion times and actually got a different excuse each time. I ALWAYS read everything carefully before I accept any offers. There was also nothing on the email to state this bonus had different terms. I was told "oh this bonus only had a max win of $200" and I said that it did not state it anywhere in the email nor the bonus terms and conditions. Nothing. They said nothing can be done. They didn’t care, they didn’t listen to me either. It’s been like talking to a brick wall. I emailed back advising it wasn’t stated anywhere of these other conditions they’ve pulled out of thin air. They then say there’s a max win of $200 for free spins. Oh my god, I know that and I specifically didn’t choose the free spins offer (which was code 6MONTHS1). They come back and say "you can’t use this offer again as you’ve already used it". Whaaaat? I didn’t ask that. They are vague and of no help and it’s pretty much oh well. So this time and about the seventh email I can’t get anywhere nor can I hear from a manager. I have all the chat transcripts also confirming it was no max win. This has been an absolute nightmare.</p>
