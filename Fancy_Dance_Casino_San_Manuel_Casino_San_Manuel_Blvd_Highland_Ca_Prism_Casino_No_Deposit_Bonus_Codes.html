    <h1>Fancy Dance Casino San Manuel Casino San Manuel Blvd Highland Ca Prism Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes</h1>

<p>Hello, I wanted to ask other people's opinions about cashback at this casino. I lost about 3000 to 3500 euros and got a total of 150 euros in cashback. That means not even 5%. The casino tries to lure players with the motto up to 25% cashback. In reality it is not mentioned exactly (wins minus losses) how much cashback you get. It also depends on your alleged loyalty level in the casino what you get. But due to the lack of rules, the casino itself decides how much cashback a player gets, they decide this arbitrarily and the cashback is only credited on request. There is only one payment per day, you cannot apply for the second. And there are no limits or you can only close the account. I can only say in 8 years online casino this is the worst. Casinos have not paid me out before, but even these were better. I had 2 nondeposits with a 10x profit cap a long time ago. After that I deposited 1500 euros again and get no more no deposit bonuses. E-mails were not answered for a long time until I wrote a bad review here. Suddenly the answers came by mail within 1 hour. Says it all, more appearances than it is, they're just trying to look good on the internet, but they're miles away from that. In addition, many deposits are missing from the transaction list, they do not want to send me a transaction list and it is refused.</p>
