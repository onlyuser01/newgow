<p>Pragmatic Play has teamed up with leading operator of casino and iGaming products 888casino. The two companies will collaborate together to create a dedicated live blackjack studio experience that will be provided directly to the operator, which will, in turn, lead to better player engagement and experiences for those people who enjoy live gaming.</p>
<p>A growing number of companies is now actively looking to create more branded and dedicated content. The deal between 888 and Pragmatic Play will allow both companies to further their products and existing footprint, boost presence with consumers, and generally deliver on a more optimized experience.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Pragmatic Play will create purpose-built tables that are specifically branded to promote the 888 name, design, and company values. On the other, 888casino will be able to stand out from live casino competitors by offering a tailored product.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is also establishing itself as a trusted party when it comes to creating dedicated studio experiences for the iGaming industry. To this end, Pragmatic even launched its Ruby Studio, which is focusing on improving the blackjack experience for all. Through Ruby, Pragmatic Play has been able to bring the best out of the table casino experiences.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely has praised 888casino as one of the best strategic partners for the developer.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to create a dedicated live casino environment tailored to its players. Showcasing our leading Blackjack solution, weâ€™re able to deliver incredible gaming experiences while simultaneously highlighting the power of 888casino," Barzely said in an official press release shared with the media.</p>
<p>888 VP B2C Casino Talya Benyamini welcomed the opportunity to be adding a product from such a distinguished studio that is Pragmatic Play. The company, Benyamini argued, offers an extensive range of products that are designed to elevate the consumer experience.</p>
<p>The executive reminded that teaming up with new content studios is a way to elevate the experience for its own consumers and players. Offering something different is what ultimately will differentiate the experience for those who choose 888casino.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is also constantly in the process of building new products. The studio is also developing both live casino and bingo games, and its dedicated studio efforts are allowing it a unique way to brand itself.</p>
<p>Recently, Pragmatic Play rolled out its full portfolio of live games on Maxbet.ro, seeking to expand its presence in new jurisdictions. Pragmatic has transformed itself into a truly global operator of iGamingproducts with a sizable footprint on several continents.</p>
