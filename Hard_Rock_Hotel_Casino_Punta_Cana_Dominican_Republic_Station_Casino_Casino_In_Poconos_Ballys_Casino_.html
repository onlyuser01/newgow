    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Dominican Republic Station Casino Casino In Poconos Ballys Casino</h1>

<p>Casino software developer Game Changing Technologies (GCT) announced that it received a gaming license from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB). The company will now be able to freely offer its B2B services to casinos and operators in the Keystone State.</p>
<p>The Software Developer Specializes in Casino Solutions</p>
<p>GCT specializes in technology solutions for the gaming industry. The software developer focuses on aiding casino operators and improving the customer experience. The San Diego-based company works with tribal and retail casinos and has amassed over 120 licenses, giving it access to over 20 US states like California, Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, and Delaware. According to the developer, its reliable partnerships allow it to be an industry leader and provide high-tech, reliable solutions.</p>
<p>Game Changing Technologies provides a range of solutions tailored to the needs of casinos. Its offerings include host-oriented customer management tools, slot machine metric analysis, and dedicated marketing management software. Among GCT’s more unusual offerings is a fully automated drink mixing and cocktail service machine aimed at bars and events.</p>
<p>GCT Adds another License to Its Growing Collection</p>
<p>Andrew Cardno, GCT CEO, commented on the new Pennsylvania license, expressing his delight in continuing the company’s North American expansion with over 120 gaming licenses.</p>
<p>When casinos are looking for a trusted partner, they need to look no further than GCT as we have proven over the past eight years that we are a highly reputable company with the utmost integrity. Andrew Cardno, CEO of Game Changing Technologies</p>
<p>GCT joins several more B2B technology suppliers that recently received permission to operate in the Keystone State. The company’s focus on casinos will help it avoid the substantial rush towards iGaming and the potential oversaturation of the market.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Gambling Sector Slows Down</p>
<p>The developer enters the Pennsylvania market at a turbulent time. The PGCB recently released the state’s July gaming revenue, which revealed that year-to-year retail slots revenue decreased by 4% to $213.9 million. Retail table game revenue remained stable, dropping by less than 1% to $86.6 million. Video gaming terminals made $3.6 million, dipping by 3.7%.</p>
<p>Despite the overall negative results, some of GCT’s potential clients in the casino sector recorded substantial revenue increases. Hollywood Casino Morgantown reported a dramatic year-to-year rise in profits from $570,000 to $6.6 million. Valley Forge Casino Resort also performed well, netting a 17% increase compared to July 2021 at $41.4 million. Wind Creek Bethlehem, Hollywood Casino at the Meadows, and Hollywood Casino at Penn National all reported modest growth, while the revenue of Harrah’s Philadelphia increased by less than 1% to $18.4 million. Parx Casino joined the remainder of the state’s properties which ended the month at a loss, with profits shrinking by nearly 12% to $56.4 million.</p>
