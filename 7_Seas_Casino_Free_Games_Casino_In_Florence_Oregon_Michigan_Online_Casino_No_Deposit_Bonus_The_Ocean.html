    <h1>7 Seas Casino Free Games Casino In Florence Oregon Michigan Online Casino No Deposit Bonus The Ocean</h1>

<p>I signed up with a no deposit bonus and completed wagering and all requirements for withdrawal so next thing they said was I had to make a deposit of minimum $30 , which I thought was much for first deposit, and I could then claim my winnings. In addition I even contacted management and live chat prior to depositing to make sure of my winnings would be available to redeem , it being a non deposit bonus. They said of course just complete kyc verification and I would be good to go which should take 2 to 3 days. Well that has turned into over a week now and it is always another excuse. I have been through such verification in other casinos that did not give me these problems I am facing. For instance... resending the same thing I done sent beforehand or this last excuse was I need to attach both sides of my card . When I ask why when all my info is on one side they respond that they want to make sure it is a working card. The thing is that it's the same one I just made the deposit with so apparently it definitely is legit. I just feel like it's a scam and worry now that alll my personal information is at stake. I would love to collect my $100 winnings cause I went on and this last resubmitted it again but if nothing else I want my deposit back. Money is too hard to come by and I am just very happy nor satisfied with this casino</p>
