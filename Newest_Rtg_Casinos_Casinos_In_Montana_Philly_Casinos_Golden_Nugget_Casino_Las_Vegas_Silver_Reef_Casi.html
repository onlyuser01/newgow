    <h1>Newest Rtg Casinos Casinos In Montana Philly Casinos Golden Nugget Casino Las Vegas Silver Reef Casi</h1>

<p>My god I am So Distraught!</p>
<p>I wish I had read reviews here in Casino Guru before I accepted the no deposit bonus from this casino.</p>
<p>But that did get spent and I had fun doing it. I liked this new casino a lot.</p>
<p>So, then I deposited 15$ to play some more on this casino and I lost that too. A little later on I decided to give it one more go and take my second deposit bonus and played another 30$. I won nothing again but was thoroughly enjoying the casino.</p>
<p>A few days later I got an email telling me that I had 10$ weekly cashback in my account so I went, and I played through my requirements and I stuck to all the rules and did not breach anything during the playback period until the requirement was completed. Then I accidently on one game slipped and clicked the maximum bet button on my next spin well after my requirements were met and I won big. I kept playing and winning on that and other games and got up to $10,000 and could not believe it. Then I made sure that I got verification for ID and all the requirements were met to withdraw.</p>
<p>I put in for a 2500$ withdrawal, as that is the maximum amount allowed at a time. I then waited seven business days and then went into my transactions to see if anything had happened and I had a 30$ chargeback on my account.</p>
<p>I thought that it was a charge for the withdrawal of 2500$ I requested. So a couple more days go by and I go on chat at the casino and speak with a really nice lady and asked what was a chargeback because I had no idea. She looked into it and said that I had a charge come back and that I was not to worry about it because they already took the thirty, but I still owed 75$ and 105$ for fees for the chargeback and if I agreed, they would just take the rest owing from my withdrawal once it is approved. Those were pretty much her exact words</p>
<p>I was so grateful because I stupidly spent my bill and food money on spoiling myself counting on my winnings. Never ever have I been so excited. Well now I am literally starving and have no toiletries or anything and telephone is cut off already, next is my internet and power.</p>
<p>After that conversation I went in to look at my bank account because I had some fraudulent transactions and thought maybe one of them was lucky legends. May have got included in those if I did not recognize the payment company. I already felt terrible and feared I would lose the winnings because I would not have been entitled to the 10$ cashback.</p>
<p>Well now I am not sure if it was my bank accidentally or if it was Lucky legends who reversed that 30$ payment but the money was there and there were three transactions for the same payment. The first going to Lucky Legends and the second going back to my account and then the third going back to Lucky Legends so there should not have even been a chargeback because the money did go to them.</p>
<p>Now I go back to the casino and talk with a gentleman in Chat and tell him what has happened and that I believe there is a mistake at their end and I am not mad or anything and had no attitude. We chatted good with each other and then he put me through to the lady I talked to the first time because she knew about this transaction.</p>
<p>I sent the actual transactions you see in mobile banking and then the copy of my original monthly statement and showed that they were in fact paid. She looks at it for a while and the comes back and says she will pass the info onto the right department and for me to get back in touch later.</p>
<p>I waited patiently until the next day and went to sign in to see if they agreed and could see it was an error and I kept getting a message "OOPS SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED" and never got back in. Never got any reply to my email messages and never heard even one word of some sort of explanation as to why they just kicked me to the curb and sent me into a mass depression and turmoil that I am still in. Without a word of a lie, I am hungry, and frustrated when I was fully entitled to the $10,000 that I won.</p>
<p>I have no food for my dog and my bills are all unpaid. Great for my credit for sure.</p>
<p>How can they do this to someone. I am so distraught and really do not deserve this the one time I win big I get shafted.</p>
<p>I am disappointed in Enclave too which is an identity verifying company because they do business with this casino, and I trusted them so in turn trusted the casino that used my identity with them to sign me in and open my account.</p>
