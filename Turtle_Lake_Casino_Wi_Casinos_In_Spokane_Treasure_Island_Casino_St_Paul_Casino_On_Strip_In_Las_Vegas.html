    <h1>Turtle Lake Casino Wi Casinos In Spokane Treasure Island Casino St Paul Casino On Strip In Las Vegas</h1>

<p>I began playing with the $125 new sign up bonus. Did very well, my first withdrawal attempt their system accepted as i had met the wagering and other requirements. I was told by an agent i had not, we went back and forth a while before i finally cornered him and he admitted he was wrong AFTER i had cancelled the request at his instruction. I resubmitted. I sent in my KYC 4-5 times with them attempting everything possible to reject it. at one point claiming my util bill was tampered with.(I should add this withdrawal initially began probably march 18th-20 somewhere in that range. 4-11 is the most recent attempt for the same funds after their run arounds and stalls) I finally after many arguments get my KYC approved and still have the email (i have 95% of the emails between them and i and am willing to provide them) so i resubmit again. Promtly rejected as i had gambled my winnings below $225 (100 for my max withdrawal and 125 to cover the initial chip) okay fine....i am beyond frustrated and now just want to burn em for the principle of the fact. I read the email, go back in @$101.27 grind on it for 2 hours and resubmit @$440+ and also respond to the email from 2hrs ago stating i have now made sure every possible reguirement is met and i want this transaction completed and to be done with it. And poof.....they go ghost. i don't get a confirmation email, i don't get a rejection email. nothing. Now since the 11th my withdrawal is still under review or risk assesment or something. I have inquired numerous times both via live chat and email. and have been told its approved, it was rejected for balance too low. my kyc wasn't approved. But mostly for the last 2 weeks ive been told that the payouts dept has it and to not contact them, wait they will contact me soon. to be honest there is sooo much more and the emails really show the insane legths they've gone to in what i believe is an outright attempt to not payout. I will gladly forward them to you because this really isn't doing the situation justice. It is by far the absolute worst customer service and blatant disregard of the procedures they claim they follow that it blows my mind. outright lying. I think you reading them and seeing the timeline would floor you. unfortunately as of this week i think I am about to do it over again with a sister site....MGMvegascasino? as i have submitted, KYC rejected, re-sent and poof....they've gone ghost.</p>
<p>Im going to apologize rright now for the mess you're about to recieve i had it going in order pretty good and was renaming them as i went.....and then that all kind of went to hell. i think i got them all....but then again i mightve missed a few. Im not including the live chat screenshots as i think you have enough as it is. if you would like them as well let me know. appreciate any help you can offer at this point. and be prepared for another one of the same nature about MGMVegascasino</p>
<p>****i am unable to upload all the relevent emails, please contact me with a email address and i will get a zip file to you</p>
