<p>Top provider of wagering solutions for the esports industry Oddin.gg has announced a new partnership with PLAYzone regarding their November Czech Championship Tipsport MCR CS:GO.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg Introduces Official Data from the Tipsport MCR CS:GO Tournament to its Platform</p>
<p>Czech-based B2B provider of esports betting solutions Oddin.gg will be able to offer a whole range of products and rights on data coming from the Tipsport MCR CS:GO tournament under a recent agreement with PLAYzone.</p>
<p>The tournament will take place in November in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and will be organized by PLAYzone. The main sponsor of the event is the top sportsbook in the Czech Republic and Slovakia – Tipsport.</p>
<p>Eight teams will be participating but the final team composition is not clear yet. However, it is clear that the best of the best will be competing for a prize pool of CZK 2,000,000 ($79.066).</p>
<p>The New Partnership Plays a Key Role in Oddin.gg’s Strategic Plans</p>
<p>The partnership with PLAYzone will be just the start of Oddin.gg’s official rights-purchasing spree. The company plans to further acquire such data assets in the future as part of its upcoming launch of a brand-new product offering live data.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg’s co-founder and Managing Director Marek Suchar elaborated on the strategic plans of the company: “Oddin.gg has big plans to shake up the esports data space, as we believe there is significant room for improvement when it comes to monetization and distribution of official esports data, not to mention offering a truly exceptional odds product.”</p>
<p>The company is going to keep acquiring such rights and it will aim for securing major deals with esports rights holders throughout the whole of 2023.</p>
<p>Suchar sees this as a very positive development that will further enhance the monetization of such rights to the benefit of all stakeholders in the esports gaming industry.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg’s strategic development plans will help rights holders bring in more revenue from their operations, it will support bookmakers in providing a wider offering of esports products also leading to more profits, and, last but not least, esports fans that love a good gamble on their favorite games and teams will be able to choose from a much wider variety of betting options.</p>
<p>Head of MČR in CS:GO Pavel Kristian also welcomed the new partnership: “Though working together on our upcoming tournament, we will have the best possible regional partner to help us grow our tournament series and establish our tournaments as a continuing part of the CS:GO Program in the region.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Kristian praised the company’s product offerings within the odds and risk management sector.</p>
