<p>The leading supplier of sports integrity solutions, Sportradar, announced that its unit, Sportradar Integrity Services, joined forces with the governing body of international skiing and snowboarding, the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS).</p>
<p>FIS Strengthens Integrity via Sportradar Deal</p>
<p>Announced Tuesday, the new collaboration sees FIS leverage Sportradar Integrity Services’ leading risk analysis for its competitions. The integrity solutions will help by delivering unique insights for skiing as well as snowboarding events. Thanks to the new collaboration, Sportradar Integrity Services will monitor betting activities for all of FIS’ events via its leading advanced monitoring system called Universal Fraud Detection System (UDFS). The system has proven its efficiency and is already recognized by experts in the industry.</p>
<p>Sportradar Integrity Services estimates that more than €40 million ($42.2 million) is being wagered on major FIS events every season. Some of the competitions that attract significant interest from punters include the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup, FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and FIS Cross-Country World Cup, among others. This once again reaffirms the need for this vital partnership that will also seek to boost the integrity of the sport.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Will Bring Benefits to the FIS</p>
<p>Andreas Krannich, Sportradar Integrity Services’ managing director, said that the interest in wagering on snowboarding and skiing events has been gradually growing recently. Moreover, he predicted that this interest will continue to grow in the future. Krannich added that this partnership reaffirms the dedication of Sportradar and the FIS to “mitigating any integrity-related threats that may occur.” In conclusion, he said: “We look forward to building our relationship with FIS throughout this agreement as we seek to uphold the integrity of all FIS’ competitions.”</p>
<p>“Skiing and snowboarding disciplines have become increasingly popular across global betting markets in recent times, with this betting interest only expected to increase in the coming years.“ Andreas Krannich, managing director at Sportradar Integrity Services</p>
<p>Operating in the last 17 years, Sportradar integrity experts helped analyze and detected more than 7,700 suspicious matches. With that in mind, more than 1,000 of those were flagged this year alone, the company explains.</p>
<p>“The insight provided to us by Sportradar Integrity Services regarding the global betting landscape within our sports and the associated risk factors will put us in the best possible position to counteract any integrity related threats.“ Sarah Fussek, director of sports integrity at the FIS</p>
<p>The FIS’ director of sports integrity, Sarah Fussek, said that Sportradar delivers unique insights which help battle integrity threats. This partnership, according to her, puts the FIS in a better position to fight those threats. Fussek deemed “essential” for FIS to have the ability to leverage robust methods to safeguard its events and competitions. Last but not least, she acknowledged that this deal will further strengthen the FIS integrity efforts and help it better understand integrity risks.</p>
