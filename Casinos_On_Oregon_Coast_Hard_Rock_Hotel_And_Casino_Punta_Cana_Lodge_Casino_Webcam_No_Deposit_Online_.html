<p>The partnership includes the unveiling of the Tipico Centerfield Party Deck at Day Air Ballpark, the fireworks series sponsorship and a welcome offer for fans</p>
<p>Global sportsbook operator Tipico continued to expand its presence in Ohio via an agreement with the Dayton Dragons, the high-A Minor League Baseball (MiLB) affiliate team of the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>Exclusive Opportunities for the Fans</p>
<p>The new partnership with the Dayton Dragons will see Tipico become the exclusive fireworks series sponsor of the MiLB team this season and a section at Day Air Ballpark named after the sports betting firm with US headquarters in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“Baseball has long been America’s favorite pastime, and this is especially true in Dayton, the proud home of the Dragons,” commented chief commercial officer of Tipico North America, David Paschkes, “thrilled to partner with one of the most successful teams in minor league baseball” and its “truly devoted fan base with the longest sellout streak” in the league’s history.</p>
<p>It is this level of fan dedication that we seek to build in the Ohio region and are ecstatic to provide Dragons fans with exclusive opportunities to enhance their love of the game. David Paschkes, CCO, Tipico NA</p>
<p>The partnership will also provide 1,000 new Tipico users from Ohio with a welcome offer comprising two game tickets and a $20 team store e-gift card. Users will be able to claim their tickets and e-card once they make their first-time deposit with the sportsbook.</p>
<p>‘The Perfect Partner’ Going Forward</p>
<p>“The unveiling of the Tipico Centerfield Party Deck, the fireworks series sponsorship and the opportunity for our fans to receive tickets are all extremely exciting promotions that we are thrilled to offer in partnership with a brand that is just as dedicated to Ohio sports fans as we are,” said the president and general manager of the Dayton Dragons, Robert Murphy, pointing to the club’s sellout streak as evidence that everyone at the club is “truly dedicated to creating the ultimate fan experience.”</p>
<p>Tipico is the perfect partner to help us achieve this goal by providing outstanding perks for our loyal fans. Robert Murphy, GM, Dayton Dragons</p>
<p>With its US headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey, Tipico is offering online and mobile wagering on sporting events, as well as online casino gaming, focusing on delivering engaging play, thrilling experiences and player protection.</p>
<p>As the exclusive sports betting and iGaming provider for Gannett, a subscription-led and digitally focused media and marketing solutions company, Tipico is the odds provider for the entire USA Today Network.</p>
<p>The partnership with the Dayton Dragons is Tipico’s latest sports-focused arrangement in Ohio as the European operator is looking to engage with sports fans and expand its presence in the state.</p>
<p>In February, Tipico became the exclusive sports betting partner of the 2023 Arnold Sports Festival at the Great Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, and just days ago, announced a fan contest tied to NCAA’s March Madness.</p>
