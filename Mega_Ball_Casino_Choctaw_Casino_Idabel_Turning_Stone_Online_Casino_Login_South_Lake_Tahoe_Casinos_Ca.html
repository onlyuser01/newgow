    <h1>Mega Ball Casino Choctaw Casino Idabel Turning Stone Online Casino Login South Lake Tahoe Casinos Ca</h1>

<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino table games and gamblers’ favorite banking game. And for a good reason – blackjack is simple and easy to learn but difficult to master. This is why the game has spawned hundreds of blackjack books that try to teach players about the game or show them some unique insight that only the author has learned about in their own experience. Many of these books are just a waste of ink or parrot others, but a handful can prove just what you need to really up your blackjack game.</p>
<p>Considering how ubiquitous blackjack is at casinos, it is no surprise that many pro players and math experts have dedicated significant portions of their lives to researching the game and searching for optimal strategies – and sometimes putting that knowledge down in the best blackjack books that we will bring to your attention right here.</p>
<ol>

Humble is a player who was able to become successful thanks to blackjack and continued to play long after publishing his book. He says that Thorp’s Beat the Dealer was a major inspiration for his work.</p>
<p>The World’s Greatest Blackjack Book was co-written by Kenneth Cooper, another meticulous blackjack researcher. In their book, the two authors provide players with everything they need to know about the odds, when to raise the stakes, and when to play it safe. This masterpiece was first published in 1987 but was later revised to include various details such as regional blackjack variations.</p>
<p>The World’s Greatest Blackjack Book was chosen to represent the game in the American Library Association’s libraries.</p>
<ol>
<li>Professional Blackjack – Stanford Wong</li>
</ol>
<p>The title gets straight to the point – Professional Blackjack is indeed a book about how to play the game like a true professional. The book was published in 1980, at which time John Ferguson (better known as Stanford Wong) had 16 years of experience with the game.</p>
<p>Wong’s pseudonym has become synonymous with a famous technique called wonging. The latter involves waiting for the perfect time to make a wager and play only until the count is favorable. This often involves sitting at a table mid-way, which is now banned in some casinos. Players can learn this and many other tricks if they get a copy of Professional Blackjack.</p>
<p>Wong is also famous for creating one of the first pieces of commercially available blackjack odds analyzing software and owns a publishing house by the name Pi Yee Press.</p>
<ol>
<li>Blackjack for Blood – Bryce Carlson</li>
</ol>
<p>Blackjack for Blood, first published in 1992, focuses on counting cards.

<ol>
<li>Blackjack Attack – Don Schlesinger</li>
</ol>
<p>Written by a prominent gaming mathematician, analyst, lecturer, and, most importantly, player, the book is one of the most important works on blackjack.

Schlesinger also explains the intricacies of playing in a team and provides valuable advice on how one can make the most out of their bets.</p>
<p>Schlesinger’s research isn’t done in a vacuum. On the contrary, the expert has worked with some of the biggest pros in gambling, including Stanford Wong, Edward Thorp, Peter Griffin, Arnold Snyder, Karel Janeček, John Auston, Katarina Walker, and Norm Wattenberger, some of which have been mentioned above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Modern Blackjack – Norman Wattenberger</li>
</ol>

Published in 2010, this blackjack book is packed with facts and teaches players about the differences between the many regional variations in contemporary blackjack. Modern Blackjack, furthermore, warns players of certain casino rules they should know before playing professionally. Wattenberger later released the second volume of Modern Blackjack which is heavily focused on advanced strategies for seasoned players.</p>
<p>“What Norm fails to tell you is that this monumental work is one of the most important, comprehensive, pieces of research ever done on the game of blackjack, and were it in normal print-book form, would be destined to become one of the all-time classics in the field. It was my pleasure to read the entire manuscript a month or two ago, and I have rarely, if ever, been so impressed with the scholarship and depth of knowledge displayed by a blackjack author.”</p>
<p>Don Schlesinger, author of Blackjack Attack</p>
<p>Wattenberger is considered to be one of the most influential gambling analysts of our time. If, by chance, this still doesn’t convince someone, they can check his web-based book, How Blackjack Works, for free. A free web version of Modern Blackjack is also available on Wattenberger’s website.</p>
<ol>
<li>Blackbelt in Blackjack – Arnold Snyder</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we have arrived at number one. Blackbelt in Blackjack was published in 1983 and remains one of the most influential blackjack books ever written to this day. Its author argues that blackjack is just like martial arts and, as a result, talks about the game as if he is talking about a competitive combat sport.</p>
<p>Snyder unveils various tricks that even pros would be happy to add to their arsenal. He also provides various tips that existing elites use to gain an advantage over their peers. As is usual for such books, Blackbelt in Blackjack teaches counting and tracking strategies and backs them up with camouflaging techniques. Over the course of 21 chapters, Snyder remains focused on but one thing – teaching players how to win real money from the game.</p>
<p>Snyder has cemented his position in the Blackjack Hall of Fame thanks to his experience with the game and his valuable works, such as Blackbelt in Blackjack and the Big Book of Blackjack.</p>
