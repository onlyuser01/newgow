    <h1>Quapaw Casino Casino Cherokee North Carolina Game Room Casino Casino Upstate Ny Wild Vegas Casino Ca</h1>

<p>Embarrassing and very unprofessional what happened with casino Barcelona ...</p>
<p>After registering, I make a deposit of â‚¬ 100 to enjoy the welcome bonus. After a while I get a pop-up window which tells me that I have "X" days to verify my identity.</p>
<p>I prepare to upload my identity document with the pleasant surprise that after a while, they block my account with money inside and verification done. Without giving credit to what happened I get in touch with them via e-mail.</p>
<p>A month later, and with a lot of waiting time between messages, I still have restricted access to my account ... I have been asked for different documents during this time, such as a registered credit card photo, bank receipt to my postal address ... .</p>
<p>Everything has been sent correctly by me and with many obstacles for theirs. At this time, after having nothing else to verify my naive opinion, his answer has been that they need a contact phone to call me from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and thus finish the verification process ...</p>
<p>Current situation: 12h pending of the mobile phone in case they call and I don't hear it ... Theirs after so much trouble generated, (if they had some elegance and knowledge about good customer service), it would be to specify a time slot a bit narrower, or call shortly after receiving my contact number so I don't have to leave your call so pending? ... For more inri I am still without having received that call: S</p>
<p>I don't think he asks for that much either ...</p>
<p>Casino Barcelona, your hope is desperate ... The worst experience and valuation without a doubt ...</p>
