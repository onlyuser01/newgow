<p>Macau Gambling Revenue Skyrockets 36.4 Percent in January</p>

<p>Macau gambling revenue saw its biggest year-on-year growth in almost four years in January. A gain of 36.4 percent from the same period a year ago returned the enclave’s gaming economy to 2012 levels, while shattering analysts’ forecasts.</p>

<p>As the Year of the Rooster, 2017 certainly gave Macau’s casino operators plenty to crow about. Not only did the sector see stable mass growth, driven by its reinvention as a family friendly destination – a necessity during the 2014-16 economic slump – but the high-rollers were back too.</p>
<p>In fact, the VIP segment was the biggest driver of growth throughout 2017, a phenomenon that apparently blindsided analysts.</p>
<p>High Hopes for Lunar New Year</p>
<p>January completed a string of 18 consecutive monthly gains, confirming that Macau’s recovery is complete. It followed almost two years of plunging revenues as an anti-graft and ostentation crackdown, spearheaded by Beijing, scared off high-rollers and forced the sector to pivot to the mass market.</p>
<p>Financials updates last week from Wynn Macau and Sands China revealed better-than-expected results in Q4, although Wynn’s stock has taken a bruising due to the sexual misconduct allegations directed at Wynn Resorts’ eponymous CEO.</p>
<p>“Overall revenue trends in January have been healthy,” Daiwa Capital Markets analysts said in a note. “We believe this situation paves the way for a solid Lunar New Year period beginning in mid-February.”</p>
<p>The Chinese New Year period is traditionally a lucrative one for Macau’s casinos, and this year they’re expected to improve on the disappointing results of last year’s celebrations, as well as at the Golden Week Holiday in October.</p>
<p>Notes of Caution on Macau Gambling Revenue</p>
<p>Nevertheless, analysts remain cautious in their forecasts for 2008. With China still very concerned about containing capital flight, there could be a political reaction to VIP growth that could dent the VIP segment.</p>
<p>Sanford Bernstein analysts said they believed VIP would decline later this year, leading to 8 percent growth for the gambling hub overall for 2018. Despite this, long-term prospects remain good, they said. Fitch Ratings was similarly conservative in its outlook in a note on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Fitch’s cautious position on VIP reflects inherent volatility and the potential for an economic slowdown on mainland China,” said the analyst. “The housing market [on the mainland] continues to show signs of deceleration, with housing sales turning negative year-on-year for three consecutive months in fourth quarter 2017. In addition, credit conditions are tightening.”</p>
