<p>Gambling.com Group has launched a new affiliate and information-oriented B2C website that seeks to inform consumers on picking the best online casinos</p>
<p>The domain and website, Casinos.com, marks the latest premium domain added to the company’s portfolio, allowing it to build on an already outstanding portfolio, and the quality service already provided through Gambling.com.</p>
<p>Gambling.com Group Deploys Its Latest Premium Domain</p>
<p>The new website was acquired by Gambling.com Group in early 2023, although the domain was originally registered in 1994. The amount total of the acquisition was not disclosed, but Gambling.com was bought back in 2011 and it cost the Group $2.5 million to do just this.</p>
<p>Gambling.com Group CEO Charles Gillespie has welcomed the addition of Casinos.com to the Group’s growing portfolio of assets. The company argued Gillespie is committed to remaining at the helm of the industry and bringing more value to readers and consumers. He similarly spoke about the parallels between the launches of Casinos.com and Gambling.com, and what has improved since 2011:</p>
<p>When we rebuilt Gambling.com in 2011 we had to start from scratch and build out all the necessary technology systems to support it. With Casinos.com we were able to leverage our mature platform and start with a focus directly on our users and the Casinos.com product. Gambling.com Group CEO Charles Gillespie</p>
<p>According to Gillespie, this new launch will lead to significant organic growth in global markets and help the company build a truly outstanding product. Casinos.com will remain a continuous source of reliable, trustworthy, and dependable information when it comes to looking up online casinos, Gillespie and Gambling.com Group have argued.</p>
<p>Merging Existing Projects and Setting Expectations High</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has also decided to stop the operations of CasinoSource and SlotSource websites and integrate their offering, content, and resources into the newly-established Casinos.com.</p>
<p>Gambling.com is confident that Casinos.com will be scaling up rapidly over the coming months and days. The Group is confident that the new domain will help players discover, locate, and interact with casinos, including from the land-based sector at a point in the future.</p>
<p>In 2022, Gambling.com Group acquired the BonusFinder.com domain to boost its presence in the North American market.</p>
