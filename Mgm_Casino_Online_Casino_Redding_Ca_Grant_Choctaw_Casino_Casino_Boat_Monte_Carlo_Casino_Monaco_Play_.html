<p>Aviatrix review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Aviatrix turns players into intrepid pilots heading out an adventure. The name of this game is NFT-inspired.</p>
<p>Players will climb into an old-fashioned propeller plane and make their way down a runway. As they take to the sky, they’ll need to cross their fingers for a safe flight.</p>
<p>Aviatrix may appeal to those looking for a novel gameplay experience as well as those who have dreamed of a life in the sky.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack blends a dreamy melody with the buzz of a vintage aircraft propeller. Whenever the player’s plane explodes, a harsh clunk interrupts the trance-like melody. Some players may find the jolt of these crashes irritating over time.</p>
<p>Players have the chance to build their own airplane in a cartoon world of vivid hues and rounded angles. With its double wings and modest size, the plane itself brings to mind early biplanes.</p>
<p>Players take off down a runway that seems to be located in a remote area. Mountains in the distance and sparse shrubbery suggest a desert setting.</p>
<p>Multiplier starts rising at take off</p>
<p>Once players are in the sky, they’ll see other planes flying alongside them. The hues of the sky range from sunset orange to deep blue, adding a celestial vibe to the flying experience. When the player’s plane explodes, this calm atmosphere is shattered.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a juxtaposition between the calm and stressful elements of flight.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>As the player’s plane takes off, a win multiplier begins increasing. The longer the flight goes on, the higher the potential prize becomes. At any point, however, the plane may explode, prompting players to lose their bet.</p>
<p>Players must balance the risk/reward of waiting for a larger multiplier and cashing out before the detonation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, players can use autoplay to set a multiplier at which to automatically pull out, cashing out for the player.</p>
<p>This game permits two types of bets to be placed each round, each of which can be cashed out at different times.</p>
<p>Bonuses</p>
<p>Players who choose to play for money will have the ability to use the Build Plane feature to create their own NFT airplane. As players gain experience points, they can add upgrades. These upgrades are purely visual and do not affect the player’s chance to win or the RTP of the game.</p>
<p>Players can participate in a range of tournaments with prizes that have been as high as €100,000.</p>
<p>Players can create custom build for their plane</p>
<p>In the real money game attached to a casino, there is also a Loyalty Program for Aviatrix enthusiasts that allows players to fly as much as they like and work their way up a Leaderboard. Special rewards are given out each day depending on how well players perform towards their goals.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this Aviatrix is not published, however, Crash games generally have a coefficient of around 97%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€10.00.</p>
<p>The volatility of Aviatrix depends on how long players choose to remain in the game. Those with nerves of steel will find themselves in a higher volatility environment. In general, volatility could be considered medium, though variable.</p>
<p>The maximum possible win for Aviatrix is 10,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this unique Crash game for players who are looking for some variation in their gambling experience.</p>
<p>Players will enjoy the cheerful animation and the creative game format. However, some players may grow frustrated by the quick turnaround of each round.</p>
