<p>Ranking the best gambling sites in Canada is no easy task, but we do our best. Our methodology in reviewing top Canadian online gambling sites is based on years of relevant experience. As a result, we have established criteria that we follow to a T to bring you the full picture. No factor is left unexplored when making recommendations about online gambling sites in Canada. The process is thorough, reliable, and yields accurate and worthwhile results. Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<p>Bonuses, Promotions, and VIP Experiences</p>
<p>Never mind what vertical you are gambling in, all top online gambling sites must provide you with a variety of bonuses and promos, and not least – a great and reliable VIP program to fall back on. We make sure to examine gambling sites in their entirety and bring Canadian players the single-most worthwhile sites that have great welcome bonus options, frequent promotions, free bets, risk-free wagers, and a loyalty and VIP program that will make every wager you place worth it.</p>
<p>Legal Status, Licensing, and Reputation</p>
<p>We understand how gambling laws in Canada work in and out. As such, we are keen to recommend top Canada gambling sites that have been licensed by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission or a province regulator such as the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario.</p>
<p>We consider player feedback to shape our opinion of a website. Canada has a track record for showing leniency towards offshore gambling sites which are some of the best sites for many Canadians. However, the betting markets are now fully shifting towards the regulated market and this trend will continue. So, even if it’s an offshore gambling site we discuss, we will always factor in player feedback.</p>
<p>Gambling Games and Products Available</p>
<p>A gambling site in Canada must provide you with the best and most worthwhile variety. Real money gambling is always about finding the top options. An online casino site will have to feature the most popular software providers, progressive jackpot slots, great live dealer games, and slot games in general.</p>
<p>Online poker gambling websites will have to have a good player base and tournament prize pools. Meanwhile, the best online sports betting platforms must offer sports fans a variety of reasonably priced betting markets that create value for recreational and more competitive consumers. At Gambling News, we make sure that this is just the case and help you find the most worthwhile Canadian gambling sites.</p>
<p>Customer Support Is Always a Good Way to Tell</p>
<p>When trying to establish the credentials of a gambling site in Canada, we always come down to the same thing – contacting customer support. Online gambling is an experience that can take you anywhere, and it’s crucial to know that the website we recommend has trusted customer support that is there for you 24/7 in some form. We test all available channels of communication, including email, phone, and live chat.</p>
<p>Speed of Banking and Payments</p>
<p>If there is one thing that has significantly changed about online gambling over the past year, that is the speed of deposits and cashouts. Gone are the days when a Canadian online casino would ask you to wait a week for your cashout to arrive. Today, we know that sportsbooks and casinos are capable of cashing out your payments in under a day and so, this is precisely what we expect from the best online gambling sites in Canada. We scrupulously examine the available banking methods first-hand and make test deposits to see for ourselves how well a website handles payments.</p>
<p>Navigation and User Experience</p>
<p>One other thing we are particular about is the quality of the navigation and user experience. We want to make sure that your gambling site provides you with a comfortable browsing experience. Most casino sites in Canada do, as they are based on innovative software that makes it easy to browse your gambling online and enjoy casino games, online betting sites, poker, and esports. We carefully check all aspects of the industry to bring you the most worthwhile experiences!</p>
