    <h1>Free Casino Slots Draftkings Casino Free 50 On Registration Hard Rock Casino Lake Tahoe Ballys Casin</h1>

<p>To begin my journey with club player casino, let's start this review from the time around mid October. I received an email from them wishing me a happy birthday. They provided me with a code for a deposit bonus and some free spins, also another code for a Free on the house chip in celebration of my special day. And let me say this, I was actually excited about it. I logged in and typed in code for my chip. And to my surprise it says sorry invalid coupon. Again I tried an same. So I went to chat help, and was told oh no I must deposit money first. Then I could get my free on the house chip. Well that sure did go south quickly.. So to get me to today's issue.. I received another email telling me about free spins again on the house.. reluctant I tried entering in the code again.. And would you believe it worked.. I was surprised and anxious to get in a few spins.. After completing the spins I decided I rather enjoyed the game so I decided to stay on that machine.. Shortly after I got into bonus round.. and holy quacamole i did it. I freaking won. The hit payed out $1400. Or let me rephrase, the hit gave me a bunch of false hope. I went to cash out, followed the procedure, which to be honest took me a good amount of my time. My withdrawal said pending. No surprise there, I expected to wait. Went to bed happy, like twas the night before Christmas. In the a.m I checked my account. Hmmm, they cashed me out 10 bucks, weird so logged in to see. The Remaining amount needed manager approval. Ok I get it, so I wait all day to check again. When I checked this evening it says manager approval of withdraw has been done and my payout is being processed. After a few hours of this , I decide to ask the help bot if it would be today that I receive the money. And this is what they said. That it's denied because I've received to many free chips( THAT THEY GIVE OUT) and that makes me not eligible to receive my winnings. Remember my birthday chip, cause I don't. I never got it, just the bait that sure was tempting, only to leave a foul taste. So here's now what I'm curious to know. Why take the time to send emails daily, if what they offer is just smoke and mirrors. I've read the details of the freebies I'm sent. I can clearly distinguish the difference between a freebie that is given after certain conditions have been met,i;e deposit this much and you shall in return to gifted this. I'm also knowledgeable about what free, no strings attached, on the house means. Or what it should mean. Which if you ask club player casino. To them free means if you give us your money first. We will give you something in return. Sounds like a purchase to me. So the only thing this casino actually hands out free is a serious let down. I wanna believe that im not the only one who has been lead down there rabbit hole to hell. Can't collect what you win. If you do win, don't celebrate yet cause now, take the amount you've won ,multiply by 1000. Take that total and park you rear cause you'll be awhile trying to reach a near impossible goal. SPOILER ALERT...if you reach it they won't pay. Just tell you that you don't qualify since you've excepted there gifts. Like for real, I feel like I was set up. Lied to, tricked, emotionally hurt and well just plain n simple just treated like I was not a vip, or valued in any way. Just the opposite. And wow I just today learned that not only is this casino a place to avoid like the covid, they also are affiliated with the other scam city casinos that flood my email daily. With more garbage then the landfill</p>
