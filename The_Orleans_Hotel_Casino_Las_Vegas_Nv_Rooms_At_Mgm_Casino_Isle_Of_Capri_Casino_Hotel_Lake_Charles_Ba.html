<p>Hey Matej,</p>
<p>If the casino looks at my previous gambling logs prior to the date in question... I always used the undo bets button when i had a change in feeling which was usually 'every round' before the round started. This was not fair and having to go through this bullshit being an honest gambler at the casino and being at an overall loss prior to this date you can see that i never had to complain because i lost fairly. What happened on the date in question was completely unfair. If my local casino told me that i couldn't take back a bet before the game started then that casino would be under investigation for fraud regarding fairness of the game. This compensation was a complete joke and i returned every single dollar back to the casino and i never accepted it via withdrawal option. I made it clear to the casino i was not accepting the compensation because it definitely was not fair and there is no proof on how that compensation was calculated as you can see from the current responses from bitcoincasino.io. Treating a player who was honest at this casino for financial gain from a error that effected the players gaming experience should be unacceptable. They used what happened to me as a way to rip me off and say f<em>c</em> you heres not even 1% back but thanks for the 99% and thanks evolution gaming for rigging the undo button by causing it to malfunction.</p>
<p>Any other casino on here would have done the right thing and returned the deposit from april 11 because they would have clearly seen the issue effected my game play. I switched to a new casino roobet and their team is honest and respectful to their players, i haven't won anything back from roobet yet but they gave me a fair gambling experience something that bitcoincasino.io failed to do for me on april 11th. If this casino can't even compensation me 5,000USD for a malfunction that occured on april 11th then there is no way they are going to compensate anyone else when something like this happens again.</p>
<p>If Bitcoincasino.io decides to compensate me because of the 1 time malfunction that occured which effected the fairness of this game and gives me a real apology then i will accept and not proceed to submitting my lawsuit papers for something as small as 5,000USD. I've already spent 10,000USD paying my lawyers to investigate what had happened and to build a case against bitcoincasino.io, i personally don't care about losing money because i gamble everyday but i'm not in the charity business and i'm taking this case personally because of the fairness which caused me to lose.</p>
