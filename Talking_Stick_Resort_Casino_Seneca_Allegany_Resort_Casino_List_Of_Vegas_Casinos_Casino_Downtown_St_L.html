<p>Daily fantasy sports and sports book operator DraftKings announced today the renewal and extension of its relationship with MansionBet, the sports betting brand of Mansion Group.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ B2B Technology</p>
<p>According to the terms of the new multi-year deal, DraftKings will continue to power the sports book and casino platform of the Gibraltar-based Mansion Group through its B2B technology, and will provide managed services in terms of compliance, payments and anti-fraud protocols.</p>
<p>“Across multiple global jurisdictions, DraftKings is changing the way fans engage with sports. Our renewal and extension with MansionBet, a tier one operator in the highly competitive U.K. market, is another example of the strategic value DraftKings’ cutting-edge B2B technology provides to our clients.” Shay Berka, Chief International Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>MansionBet initially launched in 2018, powered by SBTech’s sports book and full platform solution, looking to make inroads into the UK betting market and further strengthen its position in the online casino space by utilizing SBTech’s industry leading sports book engine and features such as Add2Bet and Action Betting.</p>
<p>SBTech was also the sports betting technology provider for Boston-based sports betting operator DraftKings until both companies merged in a $2.7 billion deal, which completed in April. The new entity retained the name of DraftKings.</p>
<p>Horse Racing Streaming Coverage</p>
<p>The sports betting brand of Mansion Group experienced significant growth since its launch and now it looks to leverage DraftKings’ whole suite of APIs across the entire sports book. The expansion will boost MansionBet’s customer offerings and experience, featuring additional horse racing streaming coverage and Timeform content from both the UK and international tracks.</p>
<p>“DraftKings’ B2B platform has been instrumental to the success of MansionBet since we launched. The extended deal will allow us to provide our players with the ultimate sports betting experience, including increased offerings and an enhanced horse racing product, utilising the impressive platforms and services that DraftKings provide.” Karel Manasco, CEO, Mansion Group</p>
<p>The extension of the deal with DraftKings is further showing Mansion Group’s resolve to provide the greatest choice and experience for its customers by offering them best-in-class products, promotions and dedicated support staff.</p>
