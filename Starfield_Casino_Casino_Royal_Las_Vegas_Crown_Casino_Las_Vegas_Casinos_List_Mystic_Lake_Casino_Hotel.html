<p>Booming Games, a developer of thematic games for the iGaming segment, has achieved an important milestone by signing a partnership with Rivalo, a Colombian operator. Thanks to this tie-up Booming Games will be able to deploy its full range of games in the local market, which is a first for the award-winning studio, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release. The news comes after a recent B2B license approval for the company in Sweden.</p>
<p>The debut of the studio in Colombia will see it bring many acclaimed games, including but not limited to Crack the Bank Hold and Win, Cash Pig, Megahops Megaways, and not least, Buffalo Hold and Win, all of which are games with established track record and strong reception among players.</p>
<p>All of these will now be available to Colombian players to enjoy as well. This is also the first time that the company has entered the Latin American market, which has been expanding not just across the sportsbook vertical, but also across iGaming. Rivalo is an operator with a strong local and regional presence, which will allow Booming Games to find its bearings and consider scaling up its offer as well.</p>
<p>Booming Games has also been determined to introduce more cutting-edge solutions and present them before wider audiences, as it is looking to deliver unforgettable gaming experiences and build up further on its brand and product. Commenting on this launch, Booming Games Chief Commercial Officer Frederik Niehusen said that the partnership with Rivalo simply marks an important milestone for his company.</p>
<p>He touted the brand for its established track record in providing players with a smooth, intuitive, and user-friendly experience. "This partnership will enhance our presence in LatAm markets, and we eagerly anticipate a fruitful collaboration," Niehusen said.</p>
<p>Rivalo country manager Felipe Agüero was similarly pleased with the developments and the opportunities to introduce new products. "We are delighted to onboard Booming Games, a prominent and dynamic game provider," Agüero said.</p>
<p>He said that the company was now excited to see how far the partnership can go, calling the collaboration a win-win situation for both participants. Booming Games has had several big developments over the past days and weeks. The company signed a content partnership with Kindred Group and it similarly onboarded with REEVO, an iGaming aggregator that helps quality products reach wider audiences.</p>
