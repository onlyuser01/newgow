<p>Partypoker Casino is another established casino in the iGaming landscape in the United States. The casino is currently operating at full throttle in New Jersey, where its main and only base of operations is established.</p>
<p>The website was launched in the Garden State in partnership with Marina District Development LLC, the owner of The Borgata, which is one of the main land-based casino destinations in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Since then, Partypoker has been ticking over nicely, driving solid gaming revenue in New Jersey and allowing players to enjoy an awesome variety of gaming choices. The casino is one of the longest-standing iGaming properties in the United States as it was established in 2013, way before PASPA was struck down and shortly after the Wire Act re-interpretation in 2011.</p>
<p>Our Partypoker review is based on the New Jersey (NJ) version of the website, with more skins forthcoming across the quickly developing iGaming market in the United States. Here it is, our Partypoker NJ review.</p>
<p>Welcome Bonus and Promotions</p>
<p>To get you started, Partypoker has made sure to carefully analyze player preferences and come up with a promo section that adds value to your experience and makes for an enjoyable ride. Note that promotions will continue to change over time so the promotions in this review may not reflect the ones available when you deposit but there will always be promotions nonetheless.</p>
<p>The welcome bonus is $25 free money on sign-up, which you will receive right after registering, along with a $1,000 deposit bonus that is matched by 100% on your first deposit. The bonus is available on all casino games, making for a great start to your session.</p>
<p>PartyPoker further customizes the experience through rewards that are available directly in your account and often personalized to feature unique promos. You always must have a registration to have full access to the full bonusing system.</p>
<p>Games and Software</p>
<p>Partypoker is a great choice if you are looking for a card room that also has a casino. You don’t have to judge one based on the other and vice versa. A look at the Partypoker casino games is enough to convince you that you have come to the right place.</p>
<p>Partypoker currently runs a substantial portfolio of titles that feature all sorts, from traditional slots to massive jackpot slots, live dealer, blackjack, table games, roulette, slingo, and more.</p>
<p>The so-called Party Pots feature dedicated bonuses that are quick to claim and always fun to have. You will find the experience quite satisfying as e Party Pots games are usually popular slot choices.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Slots are clearly the favorite at Partypoker. There are over 250 slots brought to you by various studios, and making sure that you are having a blast. IGT, NetEnt, Microgaming, and DGC will all take care of a great experience.</p>
<p>Partypoker easily brings the biggest selection of titles any card room casino can muster, putting it right on par with BetMGM and ahead of PokerStars. The slots you will discover here are many and varied and feature some excellent titles:</p>
<p>9 Masks of Fire</p>
<p>Jumanji</p>
<p>Bonanza Megaways</p>

The portfolio features numerous options that feature megaways that push the paylines to over 100,000 in a single instance, fixed and progressive jackpots, multipliers, and other special features.</p>

<p>Blackjack is a significant part of the Partypoker Casino offer, bringing you an outstanding mix of possible games. Some will be available as analogous games, but others will come in a live dealer package that makes them even more exciting to some players.</p>
<p>You get to enjoy Blackjack Fortune Spinner Pro, Premium Blackjack Pro, and Infinite Blackjack, among the available titles. If you want to further narrow down the search, you can just type in the name of the game or go to the dedicated section or simply write “blackjack” in the box.</p>
<p>Overall, Partypoker Casino NJ has a good variety to choose from, and you will definitely find at least one to stick with.</p>
<p>Roulette</p>
<p>Roulette is an even bigger sensation at Partypoker Casino, and for a good reason. While the game definitely requires a little more in terms of set-up when played at a land-based casino, you will find the iGaming version to be quite accessible and worth your while.</p>
<p>Partypoker brings you tons of titles to pick from with some 20-odd games that you can enjoy if you are a fan of roulette.</p>

<p>You may see more payment methods available as the casino launches in new states, but for the time being, New Jersey seems to be the main base of operations. The payment methods all have a very high clearance rate and allow you to quickly make a deposit or request your withdrawal.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>We have made a point of testing customer support so that we know more about what to expect from the casino. The support will always prompt you to fill out a very brief questionnaire that focuses on the potential questions and issues you may have.</p>
<p>If you can’t find an answer after a few clicks, you may choose to opt for additional help, which will come in the form of a 24/7 live chat or email. The email usually takes a little longer to get a response to, but it’s still a trusted option altogether.</p>
