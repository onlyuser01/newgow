    <h1>Tulalip Casino Jobs Mgm Casino Maryland Best Casino In Indiana Casinos New Orleans Dayton Hollywood</h1>

<p>https://topcasinoforum5.ru/redbox-lohotron/ here is a link to the forum where my complaint is described in detail. The manager of the redbox casino offered me deposit bonuses and persuaded me to make a large deposit of 100 thousand to play big. I hesitated for a long time because I wanted to play and check this casino for honesty. A month earlier, I lost about 30 thousand in the redbox and didnâ€™t go there for a couple of weeks, then I went to play and won the 50 thousand that I got, I used the deposit bonus. Then he made a deposit again and received a bonus of 5000r with a top and a large wager. I was given a personal manager who constantly called and offered all sorts of bonuses on deposit. Further, the casino manager explained to me that the wager would be laundered at a rate not exceeding 90 rubles, but at the same time I could play at any bets with an active bonus and even advised to play large first and raise the balance, then launder the wager at a rate not exceeding 90 rubles. I did so and played for 400 rubles and I caught x120 with the last money, and in total there were 50 thousand on the balance sheet. I concluded and I received a letter saying that I violated the terms of the wagering laundering. I repeat earlier I was going to make a deposit of 100 thousand and play the same way and it turns out that if I lost, I would stay with my nose and if I won I would not be paid, here is their tactics. I sent them a telephone record of the negotiations with the manager where he clearly said that I can play at any bet and they told me that the manager was wrong and they would punish him, but in fact this is their worked out scheme by which they did not withdraw money to the players. They also referred to the fact that I changed bids by raising or lowering and supposedly intuitively guessing the winnings, then they said that I already have a plus now and therefore they will not pay me. A couple of days they were cheating that they would solve my problem and most likely in my favor, but in fact, everything was done the other way around. I consider them to be scammers, they are the owners of prestige volcano casino, they are also the owners of most likely Slotika casino, allricht, Luskbeird casino and other projects. They do not work honestly. The winnings were never paid to me, according to the link above there is a screenshot of the confiscation of my balance and they just returned my deposit to me. Their manager misled the players advising them to play at high stakes and then launder the bonus, and in case of winning they referred to raising the stakes and they say the manager gave bad information and he will be punished and we will not pay you.</p>
