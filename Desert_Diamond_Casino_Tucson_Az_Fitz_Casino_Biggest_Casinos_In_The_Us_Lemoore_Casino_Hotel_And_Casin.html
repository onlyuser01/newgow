<p>Edict egaming, a leading aggregator and one of the pioneers in delivering innovative iGaming solutions, has joined forces with the slots and sports betting operator mybet. As per the agreement, edict egaming will provide its new partner with games developed by Merkur Gaming.</p>
<p>Edict Provides Mybet with Merkur Titles</p>
<p>Edict, which is a subsidiary of the Gauselmann Group, will leverage its in-house Aggregator Solution to power mybet with games developed by Merkur, another Gauselmann subsidiary. The agreement already saw 20 Merkur Gaming games launch on mybet’s website. The lineup includes hit titles such as Blazing Star, Eye of Horus and Fruitinator. According to the deal, the aggregator will continue to supply mybet with more Merkur-developed titles in the future.</p>
<p>Mybet is a fast-growing slots operator that always seeks to engage its customers with exciting new titles. The company adds new games each month as it aims to suit the needs of all of its players. As of the time of this writing, mybet’s website offers around 200 slots with more to be added in the future.</p>
<p>Edict egaming, on the other hand, is a specialist aggregator that was founded in 1998. The company has almost three decades on the market and is well-familiar with the intricacies of the slot sector. The company was acquired by the Gauselmann Group in 2008 and has worked alongside the group’s other brands since.</p>
<p>Mybet Is Excited to Grow Its Slots Vertical</p>
<p>Mybet’s managing director, Andreas Fuchs-Degler, spoke about the new partnership. He noted that his company has become one of the best-known sports betting companies in Germany. Now, mybet seeks to conquer the virtual slots sector as well. To that end, the operator seeks to diversify its offer with games from the best studios in the sector. Because of that, Fuchs-Degler is excited to team up with edict egaming and add Merkur Gaming’s critically-acclaimed slots to its portfolio.</p>
<p>Dominic-Daniel Liénard, chief executive of edict egaming, noted that edict and mybet have cemented themselves as leading companies in their respective sectors in the German market. It is, therefore, logical that two such powerhouses would team up, Liénard added. He said that mybet is both a reliable partner and one of the top brands in German sports betting. Because of its popularity, the operator is poised for growth across all verticals. Liénard concluded that he is looking forward to powering mybet with Merkur Gaming’s best-in-class titles.</p>
