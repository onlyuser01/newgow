<p>Irishman Shane Lowry is the Champion Golfer of the Year after winning The Open Championship at Royal Portrush by a commanding six shots. The victory was embraced by locals at the storied Northern Ireland course, but few saw this coming from the 32-year-old journeyman.</p>

<p>The night before the 148th playing of golf’s oldest major, Lowry was a long 80/1 at the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas to hoist the Claret Jug come Sunday. The line implied a chance of Shane winning of just 1.23 percent, with every $100 wagered netting the fortunate gambler $8,000.</p>
<p>Lowry shot rounds of 67-67-63-72 to finish at -15. His Saturday round set a new Royal Portrush record since the course was renovated in 2016.</p>
<p>Just shows you how fickle golf is,” said Lowry – who lost his full exempt status on the PGA Tour last year due to poor play. “Golf is a weird sport, and you never know what’s around the corner.”</p>
<p>The SuperBook said Lowry wasn’t in the top 10 in either ticket count or money wagered.</p>
<p>McIlroy Miss</p>
<p>Just as surprising as Lowry’s good play was Rory McIlroy’s dismal 79 in the first round. The consensus betting favorite, the Northern Irishman began his Open with a quadruple-bogey eight on the first hole.</p>
<p>McIlroy bounced back with a solid round of 65 on Friday, but it wasn’t enough to make the cut. Rory was first or second in money wagered and ticket counts at several Las Vegas sportsbooks. All of those funds are now the property of the book.</p>
<p>However, if McIlroy couldn’t win the Claret Jug himself in his native homeland, Lowry was the next best thing for McIlroy.</p>
<p>“Even though last week wasn’t the week I had envisaged for myself, I couldn’t be happier and more proud of Shane Lowry,” McIlroy said on Instagram. “How he handled everything over the weekend…. emotions, nerves and conditions tells you everything I’ve gotten to know about him over the past 15 years. 2019 Champion Golfer of the Year! Enjoy some good stuff out of the Claret Jug!”</p>
<p>Open Win for Oddsmakers</p>
<p>Brooks Koepka printed the most tickets and generated the most money wagered at the SuperBook. McIlroy was second in both categories.</p>
<p>McIlroy was also the favorite in a variety of player one-on-one matchups including against Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Koepka, Jon Rahm, and Woods. Rory lost them all other than versus Woods.</p>
<p>With the PGA Championship now played in May and no longer taking place in August, The Open concludes golf’s four majors in 2019. Oddsmakers are already looking to 2020.</p>
<p>Odds for the Masters has Koepka the favorite at 10/1. He’s followed closely by defending green jacket winner Woods and DJ at 12/1. McIlroy, who only needs a win at Augusta National to complete his career grand slam, is next at 14/1. He shares that line with Jordan Spieth – the 2015 Masters winner who finally found some form at The Open following nearly two years of struggle.</p>
<p>Lowry will arrive in Georgia as the latest major winner. He’s at 80/1 for the Masters, the same odds as last week for The Open.</p>
