<p>Fremont County, Wyoming Closes Tribal Gaming Facilities Temporarily</p>
<p>The Wind River Hotel and Casino and other Tribal gaming facilities in Fremont County, Wyoming close temporarily from today. This happened after last week Friday the Northern Arapaho Business Council (NABC) revealed restrictions in light of an increase in positive COVID-19 cases in the county. The temporary closure is in effect from today through November 30.</p>
<p>Besides gaming facilities, according to NABC, some Tribal departments will have their working hours reduced to prevent people from congregating. Offices including Enrollment, Finance, and others will be open for the public on weekdays from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. However, sanitation, food delivery, law enforcement, elderly service, and other critical departments and services will not be affected.</p>
<p>According to the NABC announcement, for the moment, pay reductions, layoffs, or furloughs will not be introduced. Furthermore, the employees of casinos will continue their employment but some may transition to temporary roles during the casino closure. The NABC said that it hopes that conditions improve so that the affected establishments may re-open on December 1.</p>
<p>Positive COVID-19 Cases Increase in Wyoming</p>
<p>The NABC Chairman Lee Spoonhunter outlined that no indication is seen that the casino is a source of the virus spread within the community. However, in light of the increased number of positive COVID-19 cases in Fremont County, the Tribal health authorities urged the Business council to temporarily close those facilities, added Spoonhunter.</p>
<p>“This is a critical moment for the Arapaho people and all residents of the Wind River Reservation.” NABC Chairman Lee Spoonhunter</p>
<p>According to Spoonhunter, responsible actions must be taken now. He outlined that if residents do not follow the guidelines and protect themselves and their loved ones – they are risking the health of their family members, elders, friends, and neighbors in the upcoming months. Last week, Chairman Spoonhunter tested positive for COVID-19 and was quarantined. He experienced mild symptoms and continues to work on behalf of the Northern Arapaho Tribe.</p>
<p>According to data from the Wyoming Department of Health, the total number of positive COVID-19 cases in the state is 14,691. Out of that number, 8,813 patients have recovered while 114 have deceased. The Department of Health statistics points out that for the 24 hours until November 8, 8:52 A.M. there were 646 newly confirmed positive COVID-19 cases.</p>
