<p>Nashville SC Hoping to Improve Their Home Performances in 2023</p>
<p>Last season, Nashville SC advanced to the MLS Playoffs after finishing in the No. 5 position in the Western Conference. They finished with 50 points, but what’s interesting is that only 24 of those points they won on their turf. There was only one team in the conference that collected fewer points at home in the regular season.</p>
<p>They did, however, start improving their home form somewhere near the end of the season. In fact, in their final five home games of the season, they went 3-1-1. Another thing going in their favor is that the last time they played against New York City FC in Nashville, they won 3-1. Playmaker Hany Mukhtar scored two goals that day and we think he could end up in the spotlight once again.</p>
<p>New York City FC Have MLS Cup Ambitions This Season</p>
<p>Two years ago, New York City FC won the MLS Cup. Last season, their journey ended in the conference final, where they lost to Philadelphia Union 3-1. This season, they wish to do even better. The good news is that they’ve signed a couple of talented players. Unfortunately, NYCFC also lost a couple of players in free agency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, their roster is still one of the most valuable in the entire league. In fact, according to Transfermarkt, they got the fourth-most expensive squad in the conference. Brazilian winger Talles Magno is their most expensive player, with an estimated transfer price of over $15 million. His fellow wingers Thiago Andrade and Gabriel Pereira are just behind him, suggesting that NYCFC’s strongest weapon is the offense.</p>
<p>Nashville SC vs New York City FC Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction for the 2023 MLS season opener is that this is going to be a super-exciting affair, probably with plenty of goals on both ends. We do, however, think the boys from New York are better, which is why we tip them to win all three points on Saturday.</p>
<p>Picks: New York City FC to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
