<p>As expected, the ICE London 2020 was every bit as exciting as we had hoped. With well over 9,000 game operators and just about 600 solutions providers in attendance, it can now be classified as a success. This time there were over 70 new exhibitors from over 35 jurisdictions across the world, a clear sign that the gambling industry is still growing and at quite a rapid pace for that matter.</p>
<p>“We go into ICE London 2020 on the back of some significant and, most importantly, some consistent growth and this year is officially set to be the biggest edition on record,” Kate Chambers, the manager of Clarion Gaming which is one of the organizers of the ICE London 2020 commented.</p>
<p>To accommodate the growing market and thus the larger number of attendees, the organizer added a number of new features that made the event truly standout. Key among these was the Consumer Protection Zone which went on to raise £65,000 for the gambling charities.</p>
<p>There were many other notable highlights from the high-profile gaming event. Even so, one of the companies that took the spotlight was Microgaming.</p>
<p>Huge Promises for 2020</p>
<p>Prior to the event, renowned Isle of Man-based gaming content developer Microgaming promised to deliver a range of new and exciting slots to its customers. This was a pretty huge deal not just for the players but also for the company itself as it adjusts following a decision to shut down the Microgaming Poker Network (MPN) which was perhaps one of its most known products.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they managed to deliver on exactly what they promised at their stand during the ICE London event. From their presentation, the company promised that, in 2020, it plans to add over 100 new and exciting exclusive titles. As if that is not enough, it will also be adding an extra 240 titles from third-party developers into its massively popular content aggregation platform.</p>
<p>For its portfolio, the game developer has been working with nine other casino game development studios that are also known for their top-notch releases. Some of the titles that we can look forward to from Microgaming and its developer partners include:</p>
<p>Sisters of Oz (featuring the revamped WowPot jackpot)</p>
<p>A deadmau5 branded slot title</p>
<p>Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar</p>
<p>Fortunium Gold</p>
<p>Age of Conquest</p>
<p>Atlantean Treasures Mega Moolah</p>
<p>Besides delivering a number of exciting titles to its users this year, Microgaming will also be doubling down on its efforts to reduce its environmental impact. This is part of the Microgaming PlayItForward, the gaming content provider’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) program. To achieve this, it will be emphasizing on such things as the provision of extensive recycling facilities as well as the utilization of both compostable and reusable materials.</p>
