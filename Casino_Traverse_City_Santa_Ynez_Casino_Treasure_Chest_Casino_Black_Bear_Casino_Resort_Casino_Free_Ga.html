<p>Jason Moore, a millionaire who profited from placing wagers on cricket games, now 53, was sentenced for the alleged murder of Robert Darby back in 2013. At the time, he was served 18 years in prison after a court found him guilty of the murder that dates back to 2005. After nearly a decade in prison, Moore continues to claim that he is innocent.</p>
<p>Now, a recent report released by The Guardian reveals that supporters of Moore plan to submit new evidence this week and encourage the governmental body in charge of judicial errors, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), to reconsider Moore’s case. His supporters plan to gather outside 10 Downing Street this Wednesday.</p>
<p>Darby was killed back in August 2005 at a pub car parking lot located in east London. Although Moore was convicted of the crime, he claimed that Martin Power, one of his acquittances, was responsible for the crime. The 53-year-old man never said that he was at the parking lot but claimed that he didn’t kill Darby. Instead, Moore said that he stayed in his car and blamed the murder on Power. Additionally, Moore claimed that Darby threatened him, owed him money and was using drugs.</p>
<p>After the crime, both Power and Moore fled from the UK. The two resided in Spain. Power was arrested several years later, in 2013 and was extradited to the UK. On the other hand, Moore fled to Dubai before returning voluntarily to the UK to clear his name in 2012. Yet, after the trial, the charges against Power were dropped while Moore was sentenced to 18 years in prison over the murder of Darby.</p>
<p>Supporters Allege Eye-Witness Testimony Inconsistencies</p>
<p>A successful millionaire from gambling, Moore was reportedly previously convicted of fraud. However, no court records tied him to any criminal offenses involving violence. In an interview for The Guardian from HMP Oakwood, Moore said: “Whenever I meet with probation, I refuse to do the courses. I just tell them I’m innocent.”</p>
<p>This is not the first attempt for Moore’s case to be reviewed. Back in 2021, the CCRC disagreed to return the case to the court of appeal. Yet, supporters of the man, which include Darby’s older brother, Tim Darby, dispute his conviction, flagging inconsistencies with witness testimony. The evidence that is expected to reach the CCRC is reportedly going to include an allegation that the single witness who identified Moore for the crime was drunk.</p>
<p>Previously that eyewitness admitted that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the murder and said that everything happened too fast. He failed to pick Moore from a lineup initially but was able to do it eight years later. While the witness admitted that he was drunk, that evidence was not disclosed during Moore’s trial.</p>
