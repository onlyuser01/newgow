<p>A week after securing micro-betting for its business in Iowa and Colorado, ClutchBet successfully launched its mobile-first online sportsbook in the latter state. The launch comes ahead of the NBA Finals and Stanley Cup Finals, allowing customers to place exciting wagers on these events.</p>

<p>What makes ClutchBet so special is the proprietary technology its platform is based on. Thanks to this, players can find customized “hyperlocal” offers and betting markets that suit their preferences. The company’s offerings are tailored by and internal trading team that ensures players get relevant markets and promotions.</p>

<p>To celebrate its launch in Colorado, ClutchBet will offer a variety of promotions to Coloradoans. Local players can register for a chance to earn up to $1,000 in free bets. In addition, the ClutchPicks section of the sportsbook will offer daily boosted game odds across many sports disciplines, providing customers with many opportunities.</p>
<p>The sportsbook has also partnered with The Wild Card Saloon in Black Hawk to promote its launch in the state.</p>
<p>ClutchBet’s senior vice president of operations, Jake Francis, commented on the launch, promising that his company will deliver the best possible experience to local players. He noted that fans can expect localized offerings that suit the needs of Coloradoan customers.</p>
<p>Francis concluded that ClutchBet’s products are designed to allow punters to engage with their favorite sports teams and athletes, bolstering the overall viewing experience.</p>
<p>Colorado is notably the second state where the ClutchBet sportsbook is available. It followed a launch in Iowa last September. ClutchBet is also set to launch in Indiana and Louisiana where it has already secured market access deals.</p>
