<p>Rizaldi said that the company is entering a “new and exciting chapter”</p>
<p>iTech Labs, a world-leading testing and certification laboratory for online gaming systems, announced that its founder, Kiren Sreekumar, has retired from his position as CEO and managing director. Sreekumar vacated his seat on October 11, in line with his planned retirement.</p>
<p>Sreekumar founded iTech Labs in 2004 and, over almost two decades, cemented the company as a leading iGaming testing lab. His leadership helped iTech Labs open laboratories in both India and Bulgaria, turning the company into a globally-recognized name.</p>
<p>Prior to retiring, Sreekumar struck a major deal with Gaming Laboratories International and appointed Alvin Rizaldi as his successor.</p>
<p>Rizaldi Takes the Wheel</p>
<p>As mentioned, Sreekumar will be succeeded by Alvin Rizaldi, who is another long-term employee. The latter man joined the company back in 2007 and has played a key, hands-on role in iTech Labs’ growth and development. According to the laboratory’s official announcement, the company wouldn’t have been the same company today if not for Rizaldi.</p>
<p>During his 16 years with iTech Labs, Rizaldi has held a number of executive roles. He was responsible for overseeing various aspects of the business, such as technical and delivery, commercial and revenue growth, compliance, accreditations and day-to-day operations. At the same time, Rizaldi was tasked with helping the company maintain robust relationships with its global network of clients, as well as with regulators.</p>
<p>Prior to being named CEO, Rizaldi served as the company’s chief commercial officer. He commented on his new appointment, expressing his excitement about the opportunity to lead iTechLabs and saying that the company is entering a “new and exciting chapter.”</p>
<p>It is a privilege to be given the opportunity to lead this great organization. We have a fantastic team, and with everyone’s support, I am thrilled for iTech Labs’ next journey of growth and success. Alvin Rizaldi, CEO, iTech Labs</p>
<p>Rizaldi thanked the outgoing Sreekumar for his exceptional contributions, leadership and guidance.</p>
<p>iTech Labs trusts in Rizaldi’s hands-on experience and proven leadership capabilities. The company said that the new CEO is poised to lead the company to new heights, maintaining and expanding on its strong business momentum.</p>
