<p>: ~10:00 PM ET How to Watch: ESPN</p>
<p>Reasons Why UFC on ESPN 47 Odds Favor Vettori</p>
<p>Marvin Vettori is as tough as it gets. He’s a great technician, but he’s also a brawler who doesn’t mind getting hit hard. He’s got a very strong chin, the evidence being that he’s never been KO-ed despite fighting some incredible strikers, including Israel Adesanya, Kevin Holland, and Paulo Costa.</p>
<p>The fight with Costa is a great example of how tough “The Italian Dream” is. Despite moving up a weight class for that fight, he did great against “Borrachinha,” throwing a total of 190 significant strikes at his opponent, which helped him win the fight via unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Marvin Vettori (190) and Paulo Costa (163) combined for 353 significant strikes landed, the 4th largest count in UFC history and the largest count ever not featuring Max Holloway, per UFC Stats. pic.twitter.com/41iyC39KcY — ESPN MMA (@espnmma) October 23, 2021</p>
<p>Since then, he’s returned to middleweight, losing to Robert Whittaker by unanimous decision and beating Roman Dolidze by the same method.</p>
<p>Not only is the 29-year-old Italian great against strikers but he’s also great against great grapplers/wrestlers. His takedown defense is 75% in the UFC, although this probably won’t matter much against Cannonier whose approach is striking-only. “The Killa Gorilla” has made only two takedowns in the 15 UFC bouts he’s fought thus far.</p>
<p>Jared Cannonier Has Promised to Knock Vettori Out</p>
<p>The 39-year-old is looking past the fight with Vetorri. His eyes are set on the UFC Middleweight championship with Israel Adesanya. But he won’t get the title shot unless he beats Vettori in the UFC on ESPN 47 main event. And he needs to do it in style.</p>
<p>In Cannonier’s case, this means that he needs to knock him out the same as he did with another 10 mixed martial artists. Actually, that’s what he’s promised to do this Saturday. But can he actually pull it off?</p>
<p>“The Killa Gorilla” is an excellent striker who lands 4.00 significant strikes per minute. His punches and kicks are also very powerful, although the fact is that they haven’t been too effective against big guys, such as his next opponent.</p>
<p>The evidence of this is that while fighting in the UFC Light Heavyweight division, he won only one fight by knockout (TKO). This time, he’s fighting a big middleweight who’s got experience fighting against KO experts.</p>
<p>Vettori vs. Cannonier Prediction</p>
<p>Vetorri is the kind of fighter you’d love to have by your side in a street fight. He’s a big aggressive dude who just loves fighting. However, his game has evolved over the years, and he’s turned into more of a tactical fighter who can outsmart his rivals.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what he’ll have to do if he wants to win on Saturday. Instead of going all-in straight away, he’ll probably try to outbox his opponent and/or take him down and keep him pinned to the ground for as long as possible.</p>
<p>We’re not sure how he’s gonna do it, but we are sure he’s going to win this fight.</p>
<p>Pick: Marvin Vettori</p>
