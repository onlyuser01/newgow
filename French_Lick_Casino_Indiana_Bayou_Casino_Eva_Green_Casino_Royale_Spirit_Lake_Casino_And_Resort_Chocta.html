    <h1>French Lick Casino Indiana Bayou Casino Eva Green Casino Royale Spirit Lake Casino And Resort Chocta</h1>

<p>LeoVegas is one of the largest operators on the market. With its vast operations and rich portfolio of iGaming products, the company is definitely a favorite among gamers of all stripes. Even though LeoVegas has had a bit of trouble in Italy over gambling ads, with the decision of the government to suspend all advertisements related to the casino’s operations, the operator is pushing ahead elsewhere.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Launches BankID in Sweden</p>
<p>LeoVegas is in a constant state of flux. Even though its operations are likely to bear the brunt of a new anti-advertisement ban in Italy, the casino is quite prepared to adapt. As one of the mobile-first casinos, LeoVegas knows how to steer clear of squabbles and drop the fights it cannot win. In light of this, the operator is making a rather big leap towards the Swedish market.</p>
<p>Leo has managed to tie its activities with BankID e-identification system, which means that gamers can log in and start gaming quicker and more importantly – safer than ever before. And from the standpoint of gamers, we always appreciate when time hassling with the red tape is slashed for the sake of how much time we spend playing.</p>
<p>In an official press release, LeoVegas CEO Gustaf Hagman went at length to explain the benefits from the adoption of this new method. For instance, he highlighted the fact that existing customers will have their login process streamlined and simplified. This will allow them to benefit from the vast portfolio of sports betting and iGaming products available.</p>
<p>These changes come amid the process of bringing LeoVegas’ operations under a proper Swedish license as of January 1, 2019. Hagman also mentioned the need for fast and reliable payouts which is yet another reason why LeoVegas decided to tie up its activities with BankID, and did reiterate that LeoVegas remains one of the leading GameTech company.</p>
<p>What is BankID?</p>
<p>BankID is a reliable way to confirm your ID quickly and reliably without any extra hassle on the part of the user. At the same time, the institutions or banks looking to confirm your identity will have less trouble too, which makes the tool a perfect fit for the iGaming sector where identity verification is important, not to mention examining the provenance of money gamers use to play.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the system is also to be lauded. Any Swedish citizen or permanent resident with a personal identification number can apply and obtain a BankID. LeoVegas was founded in Sweden in 2011, so becoming a fully-legitimate iGaming service in its country of origin is not surprising.</p>
<p>Apart from providing an array of excellent products, though, the company operates its own online gambling portal and sports betting book.</p>
<p>Naturally, BankID is not immune to scams but the level of security is heightened to the point where any foul play shows at one point or another and helps authorities take steps towards the resolution of a problem. Meanwhile, LeoVegas may need to handle its own Italian affair in light of the pending advertisement ban.</p>
