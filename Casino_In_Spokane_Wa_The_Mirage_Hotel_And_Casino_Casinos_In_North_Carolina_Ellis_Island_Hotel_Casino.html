    <h1>Casino In Spokane Wa The Mirage Hotel And Casino Casinos In North Carolina Ellis Island Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>Thank you for the confirmation, Jezzyundrafet.</p>
<p>We have received your full gameplay log from 1st January 2023 until the 28th January 2023 including your deposits or any cuts/deductions. This clearly shows and you have confirmed that as well that you were playing the 20 free spins only on 19th January and thus the maximum win limit of €50 was applied. There was only one deduction done from the winnings of €3200 to the maximum win limit of €50. No double wagering or double deduction has been done. The whole time you have been playing with the bonus so that's why the winnings have been deducted to the maximum winning amount for the certain bonus. Octocasino has acted according to their T&amp;Cs and the deduction of the winnings was done rightfully. Please understand that the winnings were "just" bonus money and as such are subject to the bonus rules. This is a common rule and you were unfortunately not entitled to the excess winnings.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously I agree with you that the livechat operator has not informed you correctly and the casino admitted that, but this was definitely unintentional as the operator most likely didn't have all the required information at the moment. I understand that this gave you the wrong impression that you were playing with real money, but unfortunately, this was not the case. The casino has apologized for that and as a sign of good will have made you a "compensation offer". It is up to you if you accept the offer or not, but we think this is a fair approach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information there is not much further that can be done.</p>
<p>Please let me know if we can consider this case resolved, or if you feel otherwise I will close this complaint as Rejected - Unjustified complaint.</p>
