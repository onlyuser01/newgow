    <h1>Casino Cancun Mississippi Casino Hotels Juegos De Casinos Gratis Casino Table Jailbreak Casino Code</h1>

<p>Hello Petronela,</p>
<p>unfortunately I don't have a screenshot which shows that I have excluded myself. But i have screenshots whic</p>
<p>I had excluded myself before the update of chips.gg which introduced new bonus programs and brought some changes (also system related). I would also like to mention that there have never been any problems with Chips.gg, I find the casino extremely fair and good. Also the live chat has always been available and helpful. I can only say that this is really a top casino.</p>
<p>But for whatever reason I feel unfairly treated regarding my problem. The reason is my chat history with the founder of the casino Chips.gg</p>
<p>He first tells me that I had to exclude me via mail, but this is only since the update of Chips.gg the case. Before the update, it was also possible to exclude within the platform. I have excluded myself about 3 or 4 days before the update because I had played a lot that day again, after the self-exclusion I received a bonus which I (because I have excluded myself) could not play although I tried it, there I saw that my self-exclusion has taken effect and I could not play, as it should be. But after I have noticed that there was a new update I have on good luck money deposited or some bonus received I do not know it anymore and simply, i was able to play again. Unfortunately I fell off the wagon right then and gambled away $18,000 +/- $5,000 I really don't know anymore.</p>
<p>After that I wrote to the Owner of the Casino (via live chat) and he first told me that I can only exclude myself via mail, since the self-exclusion was before the update, it was as already mentioned within chips.gg possible to exclude yourself. After that I told him that I did it before the update, whereupon he told me that the official way is via email and you have removed it from the platform.</p>
<p>Thereupon the operator told me that I had no cooldown set at anytime, after I became a little more intrusive and that i know my right he said he would somehow see a cooldown but I would have removed it myself which is not true.</p>
<p>I would even accuse Chips.gg that there was no function to remove the self-exclusion itself (here I'm not sure, I was neither known nor in my knowledge that you could have removed it).</p>
<p>I suspect that with the update my self-exclusion was simply reset for whatever reason and that's why I get inconsistent responses from the owner that he is not seeing my cooldown, than he sees it and then somehow i removed it ...</p>
<p>So there is a reason why they removed the self exclusion from the platform, because it was not working by 100% or susceptible/vulnerable for Updates/Changes maybe.</p>
<p>I have sent you the chat history by mail.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
