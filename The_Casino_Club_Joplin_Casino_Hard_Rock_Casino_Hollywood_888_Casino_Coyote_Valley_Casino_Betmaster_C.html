    <h1>The Casino Club Joplin Casino Hard Rock Casino Hollywood 888 Casino Coyote Valley Casino Betmaster C</h1>

<p>Dear fanatkisha,</p>
<p>I assume you are aware of the fact that it is irrelevant if your documents were uploaded to other accounts or not. And it is the same for bonuses - in this case, it is not important whether you used them or not. Regarding personal data in someone else's email/account - although it could be used by anyone, it is very unlikely that the same "anyone" would have played in the same casino, bet on the same events, and even used the same source of funds for deposits.</p>
<p>Therefore, after gathering all the necessary information and in the given circumstances, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - reasonable grounds to believe we are talking about multiple accounts used by 1 person, while it is clear that the allegations relate to sports betting play.</p>
<p>As you might know, our forum deals with complaints about online casinos only, and we do not have enough insight to take on this kind of issue.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by or one of the websites that deal with sports betting-related complaints. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Betmaster Casino team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
