<p>BF Games, a creative game development studio for the global online casino sector, has made a new decisive step in European markets. The company has launched officially with Novibet in the Greek iGaming market, a first for the supplier and an important step forward as it seeks to maintain a good pace of expansion this year.</p>
<p>BF Games is founded by industry veterans and it is focusing on leading European jurisdictions, an ambition that is now becoming more tangible with the addition of Greece as one of the places where the supplier’s games will be available. Novibet’s players will have access to a number of excellent games provided by BF Games, including Chicken Madness, Buffalo Trail, Burning Slots, and Cave of Gold, among others.</p>
<p>Novibet is a prominent local brand which means that players will have the opportunity to interact with the supplier’s products quickly and efficiently. Presently, the company offers more than 70 dedicated titles that will introduce players to traditional and innovative content, features, and gameplay opportunities.</p>
<p>BF Games Head of Business Development Claudia Melcaru was extremely pleased with the opportunity and hailed it as a milestone for the company. The key development will sustain BF Games as the supplier continues to work towards growing its presence in global markets and ensuring that it is a market leader in more than one jurisdiction.</p>
<p>"Launching with Novibet, a prominent operator in the country, puts us in the best possible position as we look to quickly make a mark and establish ourselves in this exciting marketplace," Melcaru concluded. All the while, BF Games has been making its presence felt across the board in different and important markets.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, the supplier entered an important partnership with Arena Casino and PSK. The company has been expanding beyond its local stomping grounds in Europe, heading into Ontario, Canada just last week.</p>
