<p>PSV and Rangers battle for a spot in the UEFA Champions League. Whoever wins Wednesday’s match will check the ticket to the continent’s most elite soccer competition.</p>
<p>The reason why this game is crucial is that the first part of the doubleheader finished 2-2. The match in question took place in Scotland a week ago. It was a real spectacle, in which each team had a lead at some point in the game.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to Wednesday, August 24, and the second leg of the PSV vs Rangers doubleheader is played in the Netherlands. As per oddsmakers, this match shouldn’t be a nerve-racking affair. Instead, the betting odds suggest the Dutch team will grab an easy win.</p>
<p>Still, bettors need to keep in mind that Rangers love upsetting the odds. Last season, the guys from Glasgow slain such giants as RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League. Can they do the same against PSV in the Champions League qualification?</p>

<p>PSV Players Love Playing on Their Turf</p>
<p>PSV have lost just three competitive games on their turf in 2022. All those defeats happened against pretty tough opponents, namely, Leicester City (Europa Conference League), AZ Alkmaar (Dutch Eredivisie), and Ajax (Dutch Eredivisie).</p>
<p>In their most recent game, they defeated Monaco in the previous round of the Champions League qualifiers. It wasn’t an easy win, however. After 2-2 in the 90 minutes of the regular time, the game went to extra time where Luuk de Jong scored the winner for PSV.</p>
<p>Luuk de Jong has returned to Dutch football with a bang.</p>

<p>Former Barcelona striker put on a fabulous performance in that game, showing that he’s going to be one of PSV’s crucial players in the 2022-23 season. In fact, since moving back to Eindhoven, the 31-year-old has scored a total of two goals in competitive games while also making four assists.</p>
<p>What’s interesting, however, is that there are a few other PSV players who’ve been at least as equally impressive as him in the 2022-23 season – Cody Gakpo (3 goals, 4 assists), Xavi Simons (3 goals, 2 assists), Joey Veerman (3 goals, 1 assist), Guus Til (3 goals), and so on.</p>
<p>Rangers Simply Love Being the Underdogs</p>
<p>It’s not crazy to say that even their fans weren’t too optimistic about Rangers’ chances in the Europa League ahead of the start of the last season. However, these guys managed to get all the way to the final of the competition, beating some real heavyweights along the way.</p>
<p>This season, their ambitions are even higher. They want to do well in the Champions League. However, first they need to qualify for that competition.</p>
<p>To do that, they need to beat PSV in the Netherlands. The good news for them is that they usually play good soccer on the road, which isn’t surprising knowing that their faithful fans tend to follow them everywhere they go.</p>
<p>This time, however, we might not see too many Rangers fans in the stands of Philips Stadion. The thing is that the club’s official travel partner has canceled the trip, citing unaffordable flights as the reason. As a result, the fans will have to organize trips to the Netherlands on their own if they want to watch the PSV vs Rangers game in person.</p>
<p>PSV vs Rangers Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that PSV vs Rangers is going to be a real spectacle. The hosts are expected to dominate the game, but we are sure Rangers will fight back. Unfortunately for the Scots, that probably won’t be enough to take them to the Champions League. However, their efforts will surely put smiles on the fans faces.</p>
<p>Picks: PSV to win; over 3.5 goals</p>
