<p>Leading payments platform provider Paysafe announced today a new partnership in the sports betting space after Fubo Gaming, a subsidiary of sports-first live TV streaming platform fuboTV, became the latest sportsbook operator to hire its services.</p>
<p>Reliable Payments Partner</p>
<p>Chicago-based Fubo Gaming will utilize the full suite of traditional and alternative payments offered by Paysafe for its upcoming mobile sports betting brand Fubo Sportsbook, expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Zak Cutler, who was recently appointed CEO of the North America iGaming division at Paysafe, said that Paysafe is delighted to partner with Fubo Gaming and its forthcoming Fubo Sportsbook brand. He added, “Our comprehensive range of payment solutions, with a strong emphasis on fast and frictionless deposits and payouts, will be key for Fubo Sportsbook’s interactive wagering model, and we look forward to providing strong support to the brand’s launch in Q4 and its future growth.”</p>
<p>Paysafe will take charge of Fubo Sportsbook’s credit and debit card payments and Skrill USA’s digital wallet, as well as paysafecard and Paysafecash eCash solutions. It will also cover the whole spectrum of deposit methods for players, including ACH bank transfers from checking or saving accounts.</p>
<p>The payment solutions provider will also facilitate player payouts, offering Fubo Sportsbook customers real-time transfers to their bank accounts by utilizing a choice between ACH withdrawals or Skrill USA’s digital wallet. Players will also have the option of Skrill Visa Prepaid Card at their disposal to withdraw their winning as cash at ATMs.</p>
<p>We are building our Fubo Sportsbook to deliver a truly integrated and interactive betting experience, where sports fans can be active and engaged participants of the games they are watching and wagering on.” Scott Butera, President, Fubo Gaming</p>
<p>A modern payment provider to ensure “secure, fast and easy-to-use solutions” was part of that vision, Scott Butera continued, pointing out that Paysafe is the operator to “check all of those boxes,” and Fubo Gaming is more than happy to partner with it.</p>
<p>Hyper-Personalized Betting Experience</p>
<p>With an emphasis on hyper-personalized betting experience and to align with fuboTV streaming, the holistic Fubo Sportsbook will combine data from both the betting and streaming platforms. Fubo Gaming is planning on turning passive viewers into active and engaged participants by leveraging first-party user behavior data from fuboTV.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the launch of its Fubo Sportsbook brand, Fubo Gaming acquired market access in Arizona and Iowa via Ak-Chin Indian Community and Casino Queen, respectively, to add to its market access agreements in Pennsylvania via The Cordish Companies and Indiana and New Jersey via Caesars Entertainment.</p>
