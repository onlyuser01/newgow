    <h1>Maine Casinos Movies Cannery Casino Cruise Casino Nolimits Casino Casinos With No Deposit Ellis Isla</h1>

<p>Dear Veronica,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://22bet.com/information/rules/7:</p>
<p>„Deposits:</p>
<p>22BET does not accept third party deposits. You must make deposits only from a bank account, bank cards VISA/MasterCard (Cardholder's responsibility to know the laws concerning online gambling in his or her country of domicile), payment systems Skrill/NETELLER or other payment wallets/payment options that is registered in your own name (The administration does not recommend making deposits using someone else’s electronic wallet. The administration has the right to return funds to the holder of such electronic wallet without prior notification).</p>
<p>If we determine during the security checks that you have violated this condition then your winnings will be confiscated, also 22BET is not responsible for the lost funds deposited from third party accounts."</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-players:</p>
<p>"Payments</p>
<p>For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing funds from a joint card. If you’re not able to prove that you are a legitimate owner of the payment method, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
