<p>PointsBet has appointed Edward Hartman as its new chief strategy officer. Hartman is taking over on September 6 and will be helping steer the group’s long-term strategy. The man is a well-seasoned veteran who served as EVP of business operations at the United States Football League and SVP of digital partnerships &amp; wagering at Fox Sports giving him the necessary background to carry on with PointsBet.</p>
<p>PointsBet Brings Prominent Media, Sports, and Wagering Talent</p>
<p>Before that, he held roles as SVP of corporate development for Fox Corporation and SVP of mergers &amp; acquisitions at News Corp. His focus lies mostly on the media side of the business, a vertical in which PointsBet wants to see its offer expanded. He will be working closely with the group’s global leadership team and its Board of Directors.</p>
<p>He will seek to identify and execute strategies that enable PointsBet to improve its operations across the board. PointsBet CEO Sam Swanell said that the group was pleased to see Hartman join its ranks, bringing a vast trove of relevant experience. Swanell added:</p>
<p>With more than two decades of corporate and operational development experience in capital markets, media, and wagering, I’m confident that his strategic insights will help maximize PointsBet’s success. PointsBet CEO Sam Swanell</p>
<p>Hartman himself was thrilled to be extended this opportunity with the man happy to have been offered this opportunity. PointsBet, he argued, has quickly established a competitive position across global markets, and the business enjoys backing from what Hartman called “incredibly strong” people.</p>
<p>“I am humbled and excited to have the opportunity to help drive PointsBet’s strategic priorities, particularly in the fast-growing North American market. I look forward to working with Sam and the broader management team,” Hartman concluded.</p>
<p>This news follows shortly after PointsBet said that the company is launching a dedicated sports betting newsletter to help keep punters up to date with the latest information from the world of sports gambling.</p>
<p>PointsBet also holds a license from the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission. Kansas launches its sports betting vertical today as a sort of pilot before it launches in earnest on September 5.</p>
