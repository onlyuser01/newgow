<p>Kutler's extensive experience in public policy and regulatory affairs will be vital as she takes the reins of the company's responsible gaming (RG) practice</p>
<p>In a move to strengthen its commitment to responsible gaming and sustainability, FanDuel Group, the leading online gaming company in the United States, has named Alison Kutler as its vice president for sustainability and responsible gaming.</p>
<p>Alison Kutler Brings 25 Years of High-Level Expertise</p>
<p>With an impressive career spanning over 25 years in high-level government and private sector roles, Kutler brings a wealth of expertise to her new position. Prior to joining FanDuel, she served as Senior Vice President, Global Government Affairs for Dapper Labs, a prominent NFT and blockchain developer. Additionally, Kutler held key roles at Visa as Senior Vice President of Government Affairs-Americas and served as a Principal at PwC.</p>
<p>In her new role, Kutler will lead FanDuel’s RG organization, overseeing responsible gaming policy and regulatory affairs, training, product development, and operations. Moreover, she will be responsible for managing the company’s advocacy teams, focusing on FanDuel’s Sportsbook, Casino, Racing, Daily Fantasy, and Retail functions.</p>
<p>Kutler expressed her enthusiasm for her new role, stating, “I am excited to be joining FanDuel and look forward to working with the team to further strengthen the company’s commitment to responsible gaming and sustainability.”</p>
<p>Commenting on Kutler’s appointment, Christian Genetski, president of FanDuel, stated: “We are very fortunate to have a professional of Alison’s caliber join our team in this critical role at such an important time for our company and the industry.”</p>
<p>Genetski further underlined that Kutler has had a distinguished career, which included 25 years of experience in high-level government and private sector roles, where she led business, regulatory, policy, and public affairs strategies.</p>
<p>FanDuel Group’s Sustainability Aligned with Flutter Entertainment’s Positive Impact Plan</p>
<p>As part of the Flutter Entertainment family, FanDuel Group aligns its sustainability efforts with the parent company’s Positive Impact Plan. Launched in February 2022, the plan encompasses various initiatives that aim to support customers, staff, and the public in areas such as safer gambling, diversity and inclusion, community initiatives, and environmental impact.</p>
<p>The appointment of Kutler comes after FanDuel’s recent initiatives in responsible gaming, including the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Problem Gambling Awareness Month, launched in March and a series of new measures introduced in September to coincide with the American Gaming Association’s Responsible Gaming Education Month.</p>
<p>In other news, FanDuel became the Canadian Football League’s (CFL) newest sportsbook partner, becoming the league’s first authorized gaming operator. The partnership aims to offer a variety of betting options for CFL fans while prioritizing responsible and sustainable gambling practices, and it also benefits from FanDuel’s existing partnership with TSN, the broadcaster for CFL games.</p>
