    <h1>Cast Of Casino Royale Directions To San Manuel Casino Angel Of The Winds Casino Borgata Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru .</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>Successful verification is a must to be able to withdraw any funds from your casino account unless it is about a very low amount, depending on a particular casino. Moreover, each player is obliged to use only his own funds for deposits and payment methods in their name. Since you failed to pass the KYC and the data shows it was not just a mistake, but rather intentional action(s), the casino acted correctly and in accordance with its Terms and Conditions, and we accept its decision.</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's Terms and Conditions - using a 3rd party payment method, which means a serious breach of the casino's rules.</p>
<p>Since you were given space to express yourself and have not used this opportunity despite having plenty of time for that, I would like to speed the process up instead of unnecessarily dragging it out, and I would like to inform you about our final decision regarding the matter. Basically, our attitude was already indicated above.</p>
