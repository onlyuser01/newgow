<p>Can Kansas City Chiefs Win AFC Championship Twice in a Row?</p>
<p>The Chiefs finished the regular season with an 11-6 record, which was their worst record since 2017, which was Patrick Mahomes’s rookie season. Speaking of Kansas City’s quarterback, he wasn’t too impressive in the regular season, but he’s upped his game since the start of the playoffs.</p>
<p>That’s not much of a surprise, given that this guy performs best under pressure. In the game with the Bills, he went 17 for 23 for 215 yards and two touchdowns, both of which were scored by Travis Kelce. The Chiefs also did great running the ball, with Isiah Pacheco scoring one rushing TD.</p>
<p>The result was that they defeated the bills 27-24. That’s the highest number of points the Bills conceded since November. Can they do the same against the NFL’s best defense?</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens Hoping for Their First AFC Championship Since 2012</p>
<p>This has been the best season for the Baltimore Ravens in the Lamar Jackson era, which started in 2018. The quarterback has been their standout player throughout the 2023-24 campaign. He led the Ravens to the No. 1 seed in the AFC, for which they got a free pass in the first round of the playoffs.</p>

<p>Their first game of the postseason was in the Divisional Round, which saw them destroy the Houston Texans 34-10. Jackson had a vintage performance in that game, throwing for two touchdowns and scoring two rushing TDs on his own.</p>
<p>However, he did it against the Texans, who aren’t famous for having a particularly good defense. Now, he and his teammates are facing a much tougher challenge. They’re taking on the NFL’s second defense.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs vs. Baltimore Ravens Prediction</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are the defending champions, which is why the win over the Bills in the Divisional Round wasn’t too surprising, even though they entered the game as underdogs. The same is the case ahead of the AFC Championship Game, in which they’re 3-point underdogs. So, can they prove bookies wrong once again?</p>
<p>We don’t think so. The Baltimore Ravens have grown to become a team that can beat anyone in the NFL. Their key players have experience that’s necessary to do well in games like this. On top of everything, they’re really good running the ball, which can be crucial in big games.</p>
<p>Pick: Baltimore Ravens</p>
