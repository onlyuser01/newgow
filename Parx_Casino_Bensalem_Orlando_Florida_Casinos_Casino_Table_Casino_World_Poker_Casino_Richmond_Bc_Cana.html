<p>Bethereum reports over 900,000 placed wagers</p>
<p>1M wager to bring the lucky bettor 40,000 Bether</p>
<p>Malta continues with phase two of gambling framework initiative</p>
<p>Innovative blockchain-powered platform Bethereum has posted its August recap, showing that the total bets placed via the platform has reached 900,000.</p>
<p>Bethereum Posts August Recap and Reports 900K Bets Placed</p>
<p>Bethereum, a social sports betting platform powered by blockchain, has revealed its August 2019 recap, posting strong engagement growth as well as 900,000 in total wagers placed via the company’s proprietor cryptocurrency, ‘Bether.’</p>
<p>With a clear focus on the community, Bethereum has revealed that the company now approaches the 1-million wager, which is an anticipated milestone. To reward players, the platform intends to give out 40,000 Bether to the bettor who places the millionth wager.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, excitement surrounded the platform on other fronts, with Bethereum successfully concluding its 10th AMA and once again discussing the future development goals of the project. Bethereum market themselves as a community-driven and transparent platform which strives to innovate in the crypto gambling sector.</p>
<p>The number of upstanding platforms that have managed to deliver hasn’t been high and tracking progress is not necessarily easy. Yet, Bethereum appears to have built a solid community around itself.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Bethereum will feature NFL lines as part of its latest market, which was added after request from the community. The company has been nominated as a finalist in the Central and Eastern European Gaming Conference (CEEGC) under ‘Best Cryptocurrency Gaming Platform Provider for 2019,’ the company shared in a tweet.</p>
<p>The vote is community-based, which means that the project can be supported by voting remotely via CEEGC official website.</p>
<p>Viable Markets for Crypto Gambling Platforms</p>
<p>The question with credibility remains a significant one. A cursory glance at bethereum.com reveals a decent growth so far, with bets reaching 700,000 in June, prior to hitting their the 900,000 in August.</p>
<p>According to the company, the platform has successfully attracted 6,000 players within a week of the official launch in May, but no official status updates have been given on the customer base in the news section.</p>
<p>Credibility in the crypto gambling sector is a particularly thorny issue as big projects have been known to collapse. Meanwhile, Bethereum has been focusing on both traditional sports and esports, which is likely to be more accessible to tech-savvy bettors who are familiar with cryptocurrency today.</p>
<p>Similarly, Luckbox, another blockchain-powered project has released its full-scale platform focused exclusively on esports. In July, Luckbox grew its portfolio by adding 8 additional titles. With Bethereum, we will need to wait until Q1, 2020 to see the full offer released, as per the official roadmap published on the website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) announced that its going into Phase 2 of its crypto gambling licensing framework that will hopefully allow innovative solutions such as Bethereum and Luckbox gain more credibility, despite already promising results on the part of both companies.</p>
