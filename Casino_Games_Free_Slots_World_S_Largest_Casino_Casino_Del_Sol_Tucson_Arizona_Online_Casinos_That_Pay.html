    <h1>Casino Games Free Slots World S Largest Casino Casino Del Sol Tucson Arizona Online Casinos That Pay</h1>

<p>i recently won $100 on a bonus free chip. I wagered the required amount and was eligible for withdrawal. I went to withdraw and it said I had to verify my account on the account verification form. Then I click on the verification form and the page disappears to lobby. No form. I then inquired with support about verifying my account and the representative tells me that I cannot have duplicate accounts. I tell them I don’t have and never have had multiple accounts and the agent tells me there is a user name dthompson99. My username is Dthomp001 and have never used dthompson99. I explain to him that he can check the specific player details( address etc) and he refuses to delete the account (my only account) and I need to use this dthompson99 account I’m unaffiliated with. It’s funny how when you win bonus money and actually compete the required 100x wager that they want to close my account. Long story short I emailed support and got no response other than I need to verify my account. I tried logging back on my account and my profile is restricted. Fucking scammers. Make up lies and try anything to avoid paying out customers. No proof or anything of me having a duplicate account because I don’t have a duplicate account! losers. They deserve nothing but to be shit down for ripping people off. I hope they get shut down for making an impossible verification process(go to website yourself and click verification form. Nothing but redirects you to lobby. Just a complete scam. Then they route you to customer service to be told lies that you have 2 account San drugs they’re going to restrict the account you have money on and your only account!! I hope you don’t have a John smith user name because they’ll be able to tell you there’s duplicate accounts because of similar user name with no proof just an excuse to restrict users accounts who actually win money the fair way. Shit these crooks down.</p>
