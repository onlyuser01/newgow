<p>Hammer of Vulcan</p>
<p>Release date : October 13th, 2020</p>
<p>: October 13th, 2020 Game ID : Hammer of Vulcan</p>

<p>Hammer of Vulcan is a slot game based on the God of Fire from Greek mythology. Set in Mount Etna, located on the east coast of Sicily, players spin to uncover treasures made for the Gods of Olympus from the mighty forge located within the volcano.</p>
<p>Base Game 28.40% Base Feature 29.15% Freespin 38.26% Total 95.81% Return-to-player (RTP) rate.</p>
<p>Big Win (15x) 1 in 100 Super Win (40x) 1 in 226 Mega Win (70x) 1 in 434 Epic Win (100x) 1 in 822 Win probabilities.</p>
<p>The game features 4 different and unique phases:</p>
<p>Hammer Strike – Activated when a hammer wild lands, all symbols on the same reel (below the wild) will turn into regular wilds. When this occurs within the ‘Light the Forge!’ phase, it also additionally increases the multiplier by 1. Light the Forge! – When this feature happens, all hammer wilds that land increases the multiplier by 1 and each volcano scatter provides the player with an extra spin Strike Again! – If no wins are achieved during the last spin in the ‘Light the Forge!’ phase, this feature awards the player with an extra free spin. Again, any hammer wilds that land increases the multiplier by 1. ‘Strike Again!’ will persist until a win is obtained and volcano scatters that land will also extend the chain of free spins. Buy Feature – If a player decides to play on an 80x bet, they gain direct entry into the ‘Light the Forge!’ bonus game which triggers 3-6 volcano scatters based on the regular chance of frequency.</p>
<p>With the explosive potential of free spin chains, combined with multiplier increases and volcano scatters, this is set to become one of Quickspin’s most volatile games where players can hit it big with a single spin. One thing for certain is that you’ll never find a dull moment in this visually pleasing 6-reel, 4-symbol slot game.</p>
<p>“It became clear early on that the God of Fire and his dangerous forge would be the perfect match for the thrilling math with expanding wilds and these kinds of volatile free spins. I really wanted the player to feel the weight of the game, plus the excitement that any spin could lead to a huge win – you don’t have to wait for the Free Spins to get rewarded. I also wanted the player to be on the edge of their seat with every bet and the team definitely made this happen!” Producer at Quickspin, Bjarne Grönnevik</p>

<p>Titan Thunder hosts 4 unique game features:</p>
<p>Lightning Jackpots – Players can trigger this bonus phase when they obtain 6+ scattered money symbols on their reels, providing 3 initial respins with the money symbols locked in position. Each spin causes the money symbols to display a random prize value and when additional money symbols land in the previously non-money symbol reels, they also lock in place. The ‘Lightning Jackpots’ bonus feature ends if either the player runs out of respins or when all 15 money symbols are present. If 15 money symbols are achieved then the Mega Jackpot is awarded to the player along with the random prize value specified on each symbol. Underworld Free Spins – This feature provides players with 8 initial spins and triggers when 3 scatter symbols are achieved. Retrigger – During free spins, if 3 scatter symbols are rolled, ‘Retrigger’ will award an additional 8 free spins and the current multiplier will increase by 1. Bonus Buy – If a player rolls a 40x bet, they gain instant entry into the ‘Underworld Free Spins’ bonus phase.</p>
<p>The visually pleasing 3×5 slots title, Titan Thunder: Wrath of Hades, is Quickspin’s first static jackpot game. It offers 25 pay lines and hours upon hours of exciting play with a chance to win up to 15,000x.</p>

<p>Crystal Prince offers 4 different game features:</p>
<p>Snowfall – This triggers with any win and expands the reel grid with an additional row of symbols (up to 8 maximum). Winning combinations that appear as a result of the new rows are awarded. Blizzard Seal – When the reel grid hits 8 rows for the first time, as a result of the ‘Snowfall’ feature, the ‘Blizzard Seal’ breaks and 1-3 wild frost multiplier wilds spawn on the reel to activate ‘Blizzard Mode’ Blizzard Mode – Once active, all winning symbols become locked. The remaining unlocked symbols are removed resulting in the locked symbols to avalanche down the reel grid. New symbols then fall down to fill in the empty slots and continue to do so until the whole grid is full and there are no additional winning combinations. Wild Frost Free Spins – An increasing number of free spins are awarded if you get 3, 4, 5, or 6 bonus scatter symbols, and a mix of 1-4 wild frost multipliers wilds and wild frost wilds are gained at the start of each free spin. 2 bonus scatters will cascade and provide the player with 3 extra spins.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for this amazing winter-themed slot game that offers the exciting extra row mechanism which adds another dimension to the whole spinning experience.</p>
