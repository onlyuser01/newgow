<p>iGaming solutions provider Technamin has announced a new business development with the appointment of a new regional director</p>
<p>This time, the company is bringing Hmayak Manukyan as regional director for Africa, which is a highly-promising market where Technamin wants to establish its footprint in a more permanent capacity.</p>
<p>Technamin Brings Capable Expert to Boost African Pivot</p>
<p>Manukyan is an experienced business leader who is familiar with the market and has the necessary know-how and expertise to help the company pivot towards new important opportunities regionally.</p>
<p>The company wants to merge its own in-depth industry knowledge with the burgeoning opportunities provided by the fast-developing African iGaming region. Manukyan was welcomed by Suren Khachatryan, Technamin founder and CEO, into the new position.</p>
<p>The chief executive said that the company stands to benefit from what is a wealth of industry knowledge:</p>
<p>The growing markets throughout Africa are a golden opportunity for us and I am confident we have just what it takes to provide operators with an innovative and cost-effective alternative to what is currently on offer. Technamin founder and CEO Suren Khachatryan</p>
<p>Manukyan himself was happy with the appointment and thanked him for the opportunity to step into what is clearly a responsible position for everyone involved. Manukyan added:</p>
<p>I cannot wait to see what comes of our collaboration as the African region is full of untapped potential which is crying out for better products and services. Technamin regional director Africa Hmayak Manukyan</p>
<p>In the meantime, Technamin has been amping up its own business backfoot, signing partnerships with a number of prominent developers and suppliers. Technamin inked a partnership with 3 Oaks Gaming in late November, and prior to that, the company reached an agreement to add content by TVBET.</p>
<p>The African betting and gaming market is one that has been rapidly developing over the past several months. A number of companies have established partnerships to strengthen their local presence and expand ties with various operators. Sports feeds and odds specialist SIS joined Jolibet just this month and MGA Games, an iGaming supplier, teamed up with Premier Bet.</p>
