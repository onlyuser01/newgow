<p>Push Gaming, a B2B gaming supplier, has strengthened its position in the Swedish market by signing a new agreement with Svenska Spel, Sweden's state-owned gaming operator. The latest partnership will bring new hit titles such as Bison battle, Jammin' Jars 2 and Fire Hopper, along with the upcoming titles Big Bamboo, Nightfall and other popular Push Gaming titles, to Svenska Spel members.</p>
<p>This partnership will enable Push Gaming to grow its player-first portfolio among its Swedish players. It is already established as Europe's top tier-one gaming provider. Svenska Spel's position as a key leader in the highly-regulated region will help Push Gaming's launch achieve rapid success.</p>
<p>Fiona Hickey, Head of Sales at Push Gaming, commented on the latest partnership, stating, "This latest partnership allows us the opportunity to supply our games to even more players within the extensive Swedish market. It's another top-tier partnership that sees our European presence continue to flourish and we are expecting further growth as the year progresses by partnering with key market leaders such as Svenska Spel."</p>
<p>Niklas Ortbrant is Head of Online Casino Svenska Spel. He explained that the entity is veryfocused on bringing its customers the most varied and entertaining titles possible. He added, "With Push Gaming's innovative and popular releases now being offered through Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino, we believe we have not only expanded our offering but simultaneously increased our overall quality, which we're sure will receive player approval."</p>
<p>Push Gaming has been established as one of Europe's leading entertainment suppliers. It is currently available in the majority of Europe's key regulated markets, alongside Entain and 32red.</p>
<p>The move comes shortly after Push Gaming signed a deal to continue its success in the Romanian market with Superbet. Push Gaming's portfolio of titles will continue to expand among its Romanian client base as it continues its European expansion through 2022.</p>
<p>Superbet is a leader in the Romanian market. Push Gaming continues its growth after it was fully certified by the ONJN, the Romanian national regulator.</p>
