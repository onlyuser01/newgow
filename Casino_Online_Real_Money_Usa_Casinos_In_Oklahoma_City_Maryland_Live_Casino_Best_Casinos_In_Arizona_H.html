<p>Can Viviane Araujo Upset the UFC on ESPN+ 93 Odds?</p>
<p>Viviane Araujo is the betting underdog in her fight with Natalia Silva, but this doesn’t make her a bad fighter. On the contrary, she’s a well-rounded fighter with a background in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Luta Livre.</p>
<p>Experience in these combat sports makes her a fine grappler and an even better wrestler, the evidence being that she’s never suffered a loss by submission in her professional career. Further, she only suffered 6 takedowns in the 10 UFC fights she’s fought so far.</p>
<p>Araujo is also a decent boxer as evident from the fact that she’s landing 4.34 significant strikes per minute. She does, however, get hit 5.19 times per minute on average.</p>
<p>Sure, she’s only suffered one stoppage loss in her career – back in 2017 – but she needs to be at least slightly worried that it doesn’t happen on Saturday. It’s because Natalia Silva is one of the best strikers in the women’s flyweight division.</p>
<p>Reasons Why Natalia Silva is Favored to Win at UFC on ESPN+ 93</p>
<p>Natalia Silva is a 26-year-old fighter from Brazil who’s been nothing but sensational since joining the UFC two years ago. She’s undefeated in this competition, with two wins by unanimous decision (vs. Jasmine Jasudavicius and Andrea Lee) and two by TKO (vs. Tereza Bleda and Victoria Leonardo).</p>
<p>It's Natalia Silva fight week, PEOPLE!!!!#UFCVegas85 UFC Fight Night 235. pic.twitter.com/f8WRcEnej7 — MMA By Milikin (@mmabymilikin) January 29, 2024</p>
<p>Before joining the UFC, her record was 12-5-1, with most of those losses happening in the early days of her career. In fact, the last time she lost a fight was in 2017 when Marina Rodriguez beat her by a unanimous decision at Jungle Fight 92.</p>
<p>Silva is a quick hitter who moves around fast and is very hard to hit. She allows just 2.23 strikes a minute while landing 5.20. She also has fantastic a takedown defense of 92% and is pretty good on the floor. The evidence of this is that she hasn’t lost by submission since 2015.</p>
<p>Viviane Araujo vs. Natalia Silva Prediction</p>
<p>We think Natalia Silva might be the next big thing in the women’s MMA. But this doesn’t mean she’s going to have an easy job on February 3. On the contrary, she’ll have to work hard to get a win.</p>
<p>Only if she respects her opponent will she be able to win, which is why we expect this to be a tactical performance by Silva. She’s going to land just enough strikes to get herself another win by decision.</p>
<p>Pick: Natalia Silva by decision</p>
