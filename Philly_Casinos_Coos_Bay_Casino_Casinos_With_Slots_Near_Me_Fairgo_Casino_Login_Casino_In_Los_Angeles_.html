"I continue to be excited about the opportunities that OlyBet brings to sports fans in Latvia and everywhere OlyBet operates," explained Plummer in conclusion.</p>
<p>Laura Manciet, FIM Speedway's championships Director, shared the excitement of OlyBet's boss.

"The OlyBet FIM Speedway GP of Riga – Latvia is the biggest speedway event staged in the Baltic region for over six years, featuring the world’s top riders battling for World Championship points as the series approaches its climax," explained Manciet.</p>
<p>Finally, FIM Speedway's championships Director said: "This will be a special weekend of racing, also featuring FIM Speedway of Nations – SON2 for the sport’s top under-21 teams, and we look forward to welcoming OlyBet for two nights of epic racing in Riga next month."</p>
