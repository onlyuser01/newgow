    <h1>Casino In Niagara Rio Casino Las Vegas Planet7 Casino Angel Of Winds Casino Casinos In Kc Hold N Spi</h1>

<p>On the 26th September I got a 200% deposit reload bonus, I claimed it and deposited €100.</p>
<p>After wagering of the bonus was done i had €2603 and i tried to make a withdraw but I could only make a withdraw of €2515 so I made a withdraw for that amount.</p>
<p>On the 29th September they sent me an email asking for kyc and I uploaded the documents and in the same email I asked them why I cant withdraw the last €88.</p>
<p>They answered me that they would ask the relevant team about this.</p>
<p>I dont hear anything from them until the 10th when I login to my account and see that withdraw is cancelled.</p>
<p>I wanted to contact live support but they dont have any so was not possible. So I send another email asking why i didnt get my withdraw, and they answered this:</p>
<p>Hey there, we have a Standart procedure to pick, random based higher wins and request a check from the Game Providers.</p>
<p>If we become the feedback from the Gaming Providers that all was legitime its Paid out.</p>
<p>In the Case of a Selection in that case you cannot picked again for a period of 12 Months again.</p>
<p>I have pushed the Check and hope its done within 48 Hours.</p>
<p>I made a new withdraw and Thought I will wait a while and see.</p>
<p>On the 9th Octover I send email and asked again whats is going on.</p>
<p>I get this answer:</p>
<p>Hey there as i was informed its actually in Complicance Department and under review. (Payout)</p>
<p>And then withdraw get cancelled again.</p>
<p>On the 13th I ask them again and they just says still under review and will inform as soon as compleated.</p>
<p>This is the last time they answered my emails.</p>
<p>Now yesterday when I log in to my account my withdraw have ofcourse been cancelled, but not only that also €300 less in my account and when checking transactions there is a transaction of €300 thats says manual so I have no idea what it is.</p>
<p>I sen them email and asking about this and no answer.</p>
