<p>Famed tennis Andy Roddick will now become a brand ambassador for one of the best known names in sports betting</p>
<p>Betway, one of the leading companies in sports betting, will now work with Andy Roddick to elevate its own profile among sports fans who are familiar with Roddick’s legacy and who are interested in tennis events.</p>
<p>Roddick to Elevate Betway’s Profile in Tennis</p>
<p>The sportsbook habitually covers the biggest tournaments in the sport and offers exciting fixture and betting markets as it goes along. Roddick will contribute a lot by having a dedicated column during tennis tournaments and also serving as an ambassador for the brand among sports fans.</p>
<p>The athlete welcomed the opportunity to be joining the company and consolidate its presence in tennis. Betway has been an established name in the sport, and it has delivered some of the most worthwhile betting experiences through odds boosters and competitive fixtures. Roddick himself said:</p>
<p>I’m delighted to be joining one of the world’s biggest betting brands and look forward to helping the tennis community with valuable insights as we approach some of the biggest global tournaments, particularly with the US Open on the horizon. Andy Roddick, Betway ambassador</p>
<p>The new ambassador was also welcomed by Betway CEO Anthony Werkman who was similarly excited to see the prominent tennis player become associated with the brand and join the sportsbook’s global team.</p>
<p>“Andy is a household name within tennis and his opinion and insight are going to be hugely valuable to readers of his column,” Werkman said. His appointment comes in time for the launch of “Advantage, Served,” a new platform by the sportsbook designed to provide consumers with even more insight and advantages.</p>
<p>“As we know, our customers are driven by data and statistics and our new platform will offer cutting-edge insights that will enhance the match experience to loyal tennis fans,” Werkman added, speaking highly of the new product.</p>
<p>Betway’s presence in tennis has been growing with the company recently teaming up with the National Bank Open presented by Rogers which got underway on August 5. The company is determined to continue growing its portfolio across numerous betting markets, including electronic sports, as one of its most ambitious and successful out-of-the-box initiatives.</p>
