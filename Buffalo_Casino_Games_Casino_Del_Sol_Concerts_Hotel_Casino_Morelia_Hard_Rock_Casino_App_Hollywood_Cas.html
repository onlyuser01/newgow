<p>Kick, the main disruptor in the streaming industry and a platform that is promising to revolutionize gambling streaming, has removed the lid on a major partnership with Ultimate Fighting Championship legend Max "Blessed" Holloway who has become the latest ambassador for the brand.</p>
<p>Holloway is a passionate streamer himself and he has been active on the online streaming community for the past seven years. He is now joining Kick’s distinct range of prominent streaming stars, including Twitch legends such as Amouranth, xQc and Trainwrecks, himself a co-founder of the platform.</p>
<p>Kick is also known for its frequent streams featuring Drake, and other prominent personalities. Holloway has hailed the opportunity to be featured on the platform’s roster and become a member of its ever-growing and ever-more-impressive community. Holloway said:</p>
<p>"I’m so excited to join the Kick community. I have been streaming video games with my fans for a long time, but the functionality and sense of community on this platform is on a whole new level. I can’t wait to build and grow with the Kick family and continue to engage with my fans in both the MMA and gaming world."</p>
<p>Kick was similarly excited about this opportunity and said that the partnership was indeed a step in the right direction. Earlier this month, Trainwrecks promised to completely upend the streaming world with a series of big-ticket signees, and Holloway definitely fits the profile, although knowing the platform, there will be more big names coming.</p>
<p>Kick Chief Marketing Officer AkhilSarin was similarly happy with the news, welcoming Hollway as a renowned member of the UFC community and arguing that the fighter’s impact on Kick will be felt.</p>
<p>"The interest and engagement in his initial streams was clear to see and we’re thrilled to welcome him to the platform in an official capacity," Sarin added. Kick has been a complete game-changer in the streaming community, as the platform has offered a 95-5 split with its streamers, ensuring that they get the bulk of the revenue generated through the platform.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Kick has been aptly securing some of the biggest names in the world of streaming. xQc, Amouranth and others, with their deals reportedly hitting north of $100m, although these numbers are not really confirmed officially.</p>
