<p>Rush Street Interactive, a market leader in online casino and sports betting, has strengthened its team with the appointment of the experienced Bruce Caughill. The compliance veteran will be stepping into the shoes of the operator’s new managing director.</p>

<p>Caughill’s knowledge of the law will be a key asset for Rush Street Interactive which plans to scale up its business and launch its offerings in more regulated jurisdictions. As a Canadian native, Caughill will assist the operator with launching its business in Ontario. The new managing director’s experience as a member of the AGCO will be of invaluable help as he has personally participated in the development of many of the jurisdiction’s iGaming regulations.</p>
<p>Rush Street was one of the first to be approved by the AGCO and will launch its offerings in the province as soon as the market opens on April 4.</p>
<p>Caughill Is Thrilled to Work with RSI’s Canadian Team</p>
<p>Richard Schwartz, chief executive officer of Rush Street Interactive, spoke about the new appointee, welcoming him on board. The CEO lauded Caughill’s “unparalleled legal, operational and regulatory expertise” in the Canadian gambling market. Schwartz firmly believes in the new managing director’s abilities and is looking forward to having him guide the company to growth in Canada.</p>
<p>“Bruce’s proven leadership capability, extensive experience, and strategic thinking make him a great addition to RSI,” Schwartz concluded.</p>
<p>Caughill also spoke about his new position. He said that he is delighted to be able his experience in Canadian gambling into use and support Rush Street Interactive’s upcoming launch in Ontario. Caughill added that he is thrilled by the opportunity to support the numerous Canadian employees working for Rush Street as the latter establishes its Innovation Hub.</p>
<p>Rush Street has always sought to recruit only the most capable of employees. In December, the company hired TV star Brittney Payton as its new brand ambassador. A few days later, the company diversified its offerings thanks to a deal with Inspired Entertainment.</p>
