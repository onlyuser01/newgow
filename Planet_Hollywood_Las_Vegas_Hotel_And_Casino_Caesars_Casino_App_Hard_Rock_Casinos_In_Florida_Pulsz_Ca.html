<p>The fresh hockey league 3Ice has chosen the cryptocurrency online gambling operator Bitcasino as its official partner in Canada. The deal will enhance the sporting experience while promoting the operator’s brand.</p>
<p>Bitcasino Will Produce Exclusive Content</p>
<p>As per the deal, the league will propagate Bitcasino’s offerings. The latter will work on making exclusive hockey content. A part of this content will be a Club Talk show where Bitcasino will invite various sports professionals. Fans can follow the show to see exclusive interviews with their favorite 3Ice athletes, coaches, and team owners.</p>
<p>The online casino will offer special promotions, free-to-play games, and gift certificate giveaways. Fans can also expect to see various gameday activations. The luckiest of Bitcasino’s users will have the chance to win a VIP experience for 3Ice’s Canadian tour stops. The operator will release Pick ‘Em game that punters can join for completely free and compete for some exclusive prizes and monetary rewards.</p>
<p>Bitcasino and 3Ice Share a Passion for Innovation</p>
<p>Tauri Tiitsaar, the director of casino for Bitcasino, spoke on the new deal. As a fan of professional hockey himself, he commended 3Ice for its fan-oriented approach.</p>
<p>“3Ice was brought to life for one reason only, to give the fans like me, pure excitement. This resonates very well with what we at Bitcasino have always aimed for by giving our players the most fun, fast and fair gaming experience, without taking any shortcuts.”</p>
<p>Tiitsaar added that he feels that Bitcasino and 3Ice have a lot in common and share the same vision and passion for innovation. True to Tiitsaar’s words, Bitcasino pursues new experiences and isn’t afraid of exploring new territories. In September 2021, the operator penned an esports deal, demonstrating its readiness to try out new things.</p>
<p>E.J. Johnston, the founder, and chief executive officer of 3Ice, welcomed Bitcasino as the league’s Canadian partner:</p>
<p>“We are truly excited to partner with Bitcasino and extend the skill, fun, and flash of our game to their community of sports fans.” 3Ice CEO and founder E.J. Johnston</p>
<p>He agrees with Tiitsaar, saying that the two parties indeed share the same vision as they both seek to provide valuable entertainment to the fans. Johnston is looking forward to working with Bitcasino and seeing hockey fans engage with the operator’s exciting betting offerings, hockey content, and promotions. He concluded that Bitcasino, in his opinion, is the perfect partner for 3Ice.</p>
<p>3Ice is a fairly new hockey league, comprised of six teams. The league was founded in 2021 by Johnston, who is the son of Ed Johnston – a former player, coach, and GM for the National Hockey League. Prior to founding the league, Johnston has worked as an executive producer of TV series for 8 years.</p>
