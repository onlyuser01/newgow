    <h1>Costa Bahia Hotel Convention Center And Casino Guayanilla Puerto Rico Silver Oak Casino Login Casino</h1>

<p>The Bay State is all systems go – with a final dash for the finishing line done by online gambling companies this week. Massachusetts has officially allowed regulated online sportsbooks to begin offering their interactive sports market products on Friday, March 10, and DraftKings will be amongst the regulated operators to go live, and the 21st state for the prominent US operator.</p>
<p>DraftKings has a homegrown advantage, although the company was never able to offer online sports gambling locally before. Nevertheless, it has been able to calibrate its offer and will be offering coverage on some of the state’s best-known sports franchises from across a number of leagues.</p>
<p>The New England Revolution, the Boston Celtics, the New England Patriots, and the Boston Bruins are just some of the big names that sports punters in the Bay State would be looking forward to wagering on. With the Men’s and Women’s Division I College Basketball tournaments underway, though, there is a lot more action that DraftKings will be looking to secure as well.</p>
<p>Colloquially referred to as March Madness, the event is going to be big for DraftKings and Massachusetts, although a final tally of the bets would have to wait until next month at the very least. Eligible customers will be able to bet on all events approved by the Massachusetts Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>DraftKings, too, feels connected to the state, with Massachusetts serving as the base of its operations – despite the clear limitations to offering its products directly over the years. Commenting on the upcoming launch, DraftKings Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Jason Robins welcomed the opportunity to finally launch with a legal sports betting offer and bring outstanding experiences for the millions of diehard fans in the state.</p>
<p>"This launch will mark a major milestone for our company, and we’re proud to become the hometown sportsbook for customers in the Commonwealth."</p>
<p>Apart from DraftKings, Caesars Sportsbook and Better Collective have already pivoted towards the online betting market in Massachusetts. The state is excited to also see how much online sports betting legalization will add to the actual betting numbers in terms of total handle and revenue, with the activity currently restricted to land-based operations.</p>
<p>DraftKings is also looking to raise further awareness for its products by launching the Bet Local campaign, which draws on the fact that the sportsbook is a state-grown business and looking to strike a chord with local sports fans.</p>
