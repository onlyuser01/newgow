<p>The senior-level change is with immediate effect while Kindred is yet to confirm an appointment for a permanent CEO</p>
<p>The online gambling operator consisting of nine brands, Kindred Group, announced a change within its senior-level team. The company unveiled Wednesday that its CEO, Henrik Tjärnström, resigned from his role. The change, Kindred said, is with immediate effect. Replacing Tjärnström, the company appointed Nils Andén to the role of interim CEO. That appointment is with immediate effect, confirms a statement released by Kindred.</p>
<p>Andén first joined Kindred back in 2006. For a decade through 2016, he held different senior-level roles including head of poker and head of established markets. In the final four years before leaving the company in 2016, he held the role of Unibet’s chief marketing officer.</p>
<p>His professional background includes roles with GVC Group, which is now part of Entain, as director of digital marketing. Additionally, Andén was a part of CurrencyFair as a chief marketing officer. In 2020, he rejoined Kindred and was appointed to the role of chief commercial officer for Scandinavia, East and South Europe and North America.</p>
<p>“I am very pleased with the Board of Directors’ choice of Nils Andén as the interim CEO, guaranteeing a smooth hand over.“ Henrik Tjärnström, the outgoing CEO of Kindred Group</p>
<p>Evert Carlsson, Kindred’s chairman of the Board of Directors, explained that Tjärnström was at the helm of the company during important milestones within the gambling vertical. He added: “Thus, on behalf of the Board of Directors and all shareholders I would like to thank Henrik for his valuable contributions to the success of Kindred throughout the years he has led the Company and wish him well in his future endeavors.”</p>
<p>Andén Is the Perfect Fit for Interim CEO</p>
<p>Carlsson spoke about the interim CEO appointment. He outlined that Kindred’s Board is delighted to see Andén assume the role of interim CEO. “Nils is naturally very knowledgeable about the operations of Kindred, having worked with Henrik in the executive management team of Kindred,” added Carlsson. Finally, he said that Andén is the perfect fit for that role during a transformational time for the company.</p>
<p>“I look very much forward to working closely with our Board of Directors, the executive management team and all employees to achieve the goals of Kindred.“ Nils Andén, interim CEO of Kindred Group</p>
<p>Andén was similarly delighted to assume the new role and said that he is looking forward to collaborating with Kindred’s Board of Directors, among other senior-level executives, to help achieve strategic goals for the company. He acknowledged that he was a part of the company for a decade before a brief interruption. Finally, Andén predicted further success and growth for Kindred.</p>
