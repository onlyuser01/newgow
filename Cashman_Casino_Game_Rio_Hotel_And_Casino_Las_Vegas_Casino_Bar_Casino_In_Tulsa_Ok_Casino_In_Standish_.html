<p>The leading online casino provider in Italy, NetBet Italy, announced it forged a new deal, expanding further its portfolio of content. The company revealed Monday it joined forces with RAW iGaming, an innovative provider of casino games. Per the deal with the leading provider, NetBet Italy expands further its portfolio of offering and delivers engaging options for its growing customer base.</p>
<p>Thanks to the partnership with RAW iGaming, customers of the operator in the country will be able to tap into slots like Blackbeards Super Slice Rings, Popeye vs Brutus Super Slice, as well as Mad Joker Super Slice, among other entertaining and engaging titles.</p>
<p>Under the deal with RAW iGaming, NetBet Italy's growing customer base will be able to tap into the provider's innovative SuperSlice engine. The unique solution is designed in a way to elevate player excitement by providing slices that contain different boosts such as multipliers, free spins, re-spins, high or low value symbols, as well as expanding wilds. This functionality creates unique experiences and thrill with every spin, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Tom Wood, RAW iGaming's CEO, shared his excitement about the latest collaboration saying: "This is a great partnership that will allow NetBet players to access our truly thrilling online casino content for the first time." Finally, he explained: "This integration will allow NetBet to stand out from its rivals with disruptive and innovative content that keeps players coming back for more."</p>
<p>Claudia Georgevici, NetBet Italy's PR manager, was also excited about the latest partnership. "Here at NetBet, we pride ourselves on our relationship with our game providers and we welcome RAW iGaming to our online casino," she explained. Finally, Georgevici outlined: "They truly are ahead of their time with their unique graphics and intuitive gameplay, and we are certain that this will be the start of a fantastic partnership that will last for many years to come."</p>
<p>The deal with RAW iGaming comes after recently, NetBet Italy expanded its content library after teaming up with the popular developer of games for the iGaming vertical, G Games. In a recent deal, the developer agreed to supply its games for the operator in the country, which helps expand its reach to new audiences.</p>
<p>As a result, NetBet Italy clients were able to tap into a selection of classic slots, as well as fan-favorite titles from G Games. The deal was announced earlier this month and strengthened further the operator's presence in the country.</p>
