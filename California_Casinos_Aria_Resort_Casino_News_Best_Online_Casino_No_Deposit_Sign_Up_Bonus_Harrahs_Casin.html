<p>Hub88, the leading company offering an efficient integration platform for gambling suppliers, announced a new content integration partnership with Slotmill, the fast-growing iGaming industry content supplier.</p>
<p>Hub88 and Slotmill Ink New Deal</p>
<p>The new collaboration was announced Monday and sees Hub88 expand its casino portfolio of content by integrating highly-popular games from Slotmill. Those games include popular titles such as Sands of Eternity, Wildfire and Money Jar, among others popular games.</p>
<p>For the leading content supplier, the partnership means it will expand the reach of its quality products. On the other hand, Hub88 will strengthen its global footprint by expanding its casino offering. The integration of the new titles is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with Hub88 and look forward to a partnership that definitively will help us meet our ambitions growth targets.“ Andreas Ternström, chief commercial officer at Slotmill</p>
<p>Slotmill’s chief commercial officer, Andreas Ternström, said that the content integration deal with Hub88 brings excitement to the company. He added that the company is looking forward to the benefits the new collaboration will bring and help Slotmill hit new growth objectives.</p>
<p>“Slotmill has established itself as a provider of high-end slots and is regarded as “NetEnt 2.0” by many in the industry.“ José Micallef, managing director at Hub88</p>
<p>Hub88’s managing director, José Micallef, acknowledged that Slotmill is famous for its quality content for the iGaming industry. In fact, he added that the company is labelled as the second version of NetEnt by operators within the gambling industry. Micallef pointed out that Slotmill’s content offers supreme entertainment for the players. In conclusion, Hub88’s managing director said that the company is looking forward to launching the leading developer’s content to its network of operators around the globe.</p>
<p>Slotmill Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Slotmill inked an agreement with Svenska Spell. As a result, the company agreed to provide its leading content bolstering the operator’s offering. While this collaboration expanded Svenska Spell’s portfolio of content, it also helped Slotmill by expanding the reach of its products.</p>
<p>Before that, in June, Slotmill announced a new distribution deal with Games Global, the leading aggregation platform operator. Under the terms of the distribution deal, Slotmill agreed to provide its full portfolio of content for Games Global.</p>
<p>It was back in 2019 when Slotmill was founded. Since then, the company has been growing rapidly to reaffirm its position as a leading provider of premium casino games. To ensure the quality of its products, the company gathered a team of casino industry veterans with years of experience.</p>
