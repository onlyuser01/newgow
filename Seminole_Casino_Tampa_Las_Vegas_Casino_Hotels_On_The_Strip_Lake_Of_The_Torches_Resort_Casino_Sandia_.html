<p>T-Rex II Slot Review</p>
<p>As RTG’s second installment in the T-Rex series, T-Rex II continues the story of the fiercest predators that continue to excite our interest even today, thousands of years after their extinction from this planet. With excellent bonus features, plenty of multipliers and, of course, the tale of the fascinating dinosaurs getting eaten, the 5×3 slot with 25 active lines has plenty to offer.</p>
<p>Thanks to the progressive jackpots and the maximum win that can reach 50,000x bet per line, T-Rex II is a game that also sparked our interest. Keep reading our comprehensive online slot review to find out all about the gameplay, theme, storyline, paytable, animations, soundtrack, and bonus features.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Watch the Dinosaurs Get Devoured by T-Rex</p>
<p>Similar to the first game in the series, T-Rex II features the same dinosaur theme and has also preserved most of the original, eye-catching graphics. The dinosaur symbols are of good quality while the Royal symbols have more of a horror look. As expected, the T-Rex is the main character of the game, with plenty of Dinosaur Eggs, Stegosaurus, the Dilophosaurus, Ankylosaurus, and additional creatures roaming the land next to it.</p>
<p>The carefully designed game elements and smooth visuals are likely to appeal to both fans of the genre as well as players who are simply looking for a fan of RTG’s quality releases. The backdrop is represented by the cave created by the collapsing rocks seen in the intro of the game, explored by the dinosaurs hiding from the massive T-Rex ready to eat them.</p>
<p>T-Rex II: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols are represented by the royal cards that pay between 5x and 125x for three, four, or four identical symbols landing on an active payline. Qs, Ks, and As pay between 5x and 250x for three to five symbols, while the wild purple berries pay 10x, 50x, and 300x for three, four, and five matching symbols on an active payline. The Stegosaurus, the Dilophosaurus, and the Ankylosaurus are the highest-paying symbols in the game, rewarding players with payouts ranging from 2x to 2,500x.</p>
<p>The game’s wild symbol is represented by a T-Rex while the scatter is the dinosaur egg. We are going to discuss their roles and effects on the game later on in the section dedicated to the bonus features in our review.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The sound effects and soundtrack manage to create a dreadful, horror-like atmosphere, with a few improvements compared to the original game. The animations are also noticeable while the reels are spinning and the special game symbols are used to create the generous payouts. The most interesting sounds are generated when the wild T-Rex symbol replaces the other symbols, with specific roaring sounds from the animals being heard. The sounds will likely remind players of the iconic movie Jurassic Park.</p>
<p>T-Rex II Gameplay</p>
<p>The game counts between one and 25 active lines while also allowing players to take their pick from 1 and 25 coins with different coin values that can take the total bet from $0.25 up to $125. The maximum stake to pay is capped at 5,000x, a rather generous reward compared to other video slots available today. The game also comes with high volatility that allows it to pay back as much as it says it can. The progressive jackpots are also seen cycling through on the small display visible in the upper right corner.</p>
<p>Players can easily consult the game setting, game history, or access the game info including all the available symbols and their payouts in the paytable by clicking the hamburger menu with three horizontal lines to the right of the screen. The game controls are also found there including turbo mode, the highest bet amount, automatic spin mode, or automatic spin mode for players who wish to see the reels spinning without touching the spin tab.</p>
<p>T-Rex II: T-Rex Terror Wilds, Free Games &amp; Progressive Jackpots</p>
<p>The game has a few interesting bonus features, with the most important of them revolving around the T-Rex symbol. Not only does the T-Rex work as a substitute that replaces other symbols in different winning combinations, but it works by applying its 2x multipliers to the newly calculated rewards. Players scoop up double wins, with more wins waiting to be triggered. However, the wild symbol cannot replace the scatter. Once the T-Rex wild is seen landing on the first reel, it signals the T-Rex Terror Wild feature. Provided the dinosaur wants to eat the rest of the symbols representing the other dinosaurs on the grid, high-value dinosaurs will be replaced with T-Rex wilds.</p>
<p>When a minimum of three scatters are seen landing on the reels, they trigger the Free Games feature which rewards players 10 to 100 free spins, depending on the exact number of scatters used to initiate the feature that will stay active during the free games.</p>
<p>Players can win progressive jackpots at the end of any base game. The jackpots can be randomly triggered and they are automatically added to any other wins scored by the players. The contribution of the random progressive jackpots cannot go over the value of 1.5% of the RTP.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Players looking forward to a well-executed dinosaur-themed slot with good features and an amazing potential for good payouts can try out Realtime Gaming’s T-Rex II title, the sequel to the original game released earlier. The thrill of the progressive jackpots comes from the fact that players never know what they are going to get. Fans of games with progressive jackpots are likely to find this title interesting enough to give it a try.</p>
<p>Plus, the excitement of watching the dinosaurs getting devoured by the mighty T-Rex along with the multipliers and the rest of the special bonus features turn the game into an excellent recommendation on our behalf, especially for fans of the genre. However, players who are looking for a fast-paced slot with a lot of explosive action on the reels might not fully appreciate this 2019 release from the popular studio.</p>
