<p>Rise of Ra review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Rise of Ra is a hieroglyph inspired ancient Egyptian slot machine.</p>
<p>It’s the first in a series of Rise of Ra games from EGT. As a result of its earliness in the series, it feels a little dated in some ways. But the theme is a classic one, and even dull versions of the ancient Egyptian slot tend to work pretty well.</p>
<p>This is definitely a dull version of the ancient Egyptian slot.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring a 60 spins long free spins bonus game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are reasonable, though the faces on the human symbols look a little dodgy. The artifacts and hieroglyphs look nice.</p>
<p>And everything is reasonably well animated with a soundtrack that is minimalist but fine.</p>
<p>Most of this slot’s attitude to design seemed to get the basics right, and then stop.</p>
<p>Big win in the Rise of Ra slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>This slot has five reels, three rows and fifteen win lines.</p>
<p>The system used is a little clunky and lacks a turbo version to speed things up.</p>
<p>There is a basic free spin bonus (details below) and a gamble feature. But, as with the graphics, everything feels minimalist and basic. Phoned in even.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. Any win that includes one or more Wilds is doubled.</p>
<p>Big win thanks to the combination of a high symbol and a Wild symbol</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols trigger fifteen free spins. During the free spins, a multiplier of x3 is applied to all wins.</p>
<p>At the end of any random spin, Rise of Ra can trigger a jackpot bonus. This starts with a picking game in which 12 cards are dealt out and the player must pick cards until they have three of a matching suit.</p>
<p>Rise of Ra has four progressive jackpots. These are – from smallest to largest – the club, diamond, heart, and spade jackpots. The player then wins the jackpot of the suit they matched three times.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.97%, pretty much spot on on our yardstick for average, which is roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.15 up to a maximum of $/£/€90.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Rise of Ra slot machine</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With an RTP of 95.97%, which is pretty much average, this game could be an adept for a recommendation, if it had high volatility or unique gameplay. However, it earns itself no points with its medium volatility and ordinary bonus features.</p>
<p>The whole slot feels like it was put out with minimal effort. Give it a miss and check out one of the other slots in the ancient Egyptian style, of which there are plenty.</p>
