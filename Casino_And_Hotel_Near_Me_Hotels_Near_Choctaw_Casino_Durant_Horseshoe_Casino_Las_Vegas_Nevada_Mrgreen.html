<p>US State Department Accuses Philippine Casino Sector of Ongoing AML Deficiencies</p>

<p>The Philippines has tightened anti-money laundering (AML) controls at its casinos, but the gaming sector is still guilty of “ongoing deficiencies,” according to the recent US State Department’s Narcotics Control Strategy Report.</p>

<p>These include the liberal acceptance of proxy betting and the sector’s high transaction reporting threshold of $100,000.</p>
<p>The annual State Department report is compiled to outline the efforts of key countries across the globe to attack the international drug trade and combat money laundering and financial crime.</p>
<p>Bangladesh Bank Heist</p>
<p>The 2016 cyber-heist on the New York Federal Reserve Bank embarrassed the Philippine government into reforming its lightly regulated casino sector – to a degree.</p>
<p>Computer hackers, possibly acting on behalf of the North Korean government, were able to transfer $101 million from a bank account owned by the government of Bangladesh. Some $89 million found its way into casinos in the Philippines where most of it promptly disappeared.</p>
<p>The incident drew the world’s attention to the Philippine’s AML failings. Its Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001 had imposed transaction reporting directives on the financial sector but had exempted casinos. But facing pressure from the World Bank, the country’s lawmaker’s tightened controls.</p>
<p>The State Department noted the country’s casinos were now controlled by the Anti-Money Laundering Act, but suggested they were still getting an east ride. For example, where the country’s financial institutions are required to file a report to financial regulators on all transactions over roughly $10,000, for casinos the threshold is roughly $100,000.</p>
<p>In the US and many jurisdictions around the world, $10,000, or its rough equivalent value in local currency, is the reporting threshold for both casinos and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Living by Proxy</p>
<p>The State Department also noted that the junket industry, which lends money to high-rollers to gamble at the casinos, was still exempt from the Act, making it easy for wealthy criminals to circumvent checks and balances. Non-cash transactions are also excluded from AML reporting.</p>
<p>The report highlighted the prominent culture of proxy betting, in which a gambler or gamblers are able to give instructions, usually online, to an individual inside a live casino to place bets on their behalf on games like baccarat in real-time. Customers can open accounts, deposit money, and settle at proxy betting websites.</p>
<p>While gambling in casinos on behalf of a third-party is usually illegal in the US and Europe for AML reasons, and has recently been banned in Macau, Philippine operator-regulator PAGCOR actively nurtures and licenses proxy betting companies.</p>
<p>The State Department also expressed concern about PAGCOR’S dual role of operator-regulator, which it said raises conflict-of-interest issues.</p>
