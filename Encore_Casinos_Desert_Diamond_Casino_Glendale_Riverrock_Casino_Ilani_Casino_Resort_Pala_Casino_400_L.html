    <h1>Encore Casinos Desert Diamond Casino Glendale Riverrock Casino Ilani Casino Resort Pala Casino 400 L</h1>

<p>I participated in 4 tournaments that started in November 2023 and ended on 03/12/2023, in which I won prizes in all four . You'll find the photos attached.</p>
<p>The total prize money I should have received is R$1050.00 .</p>
<p>The payment promise was 14 days later, according to the Terms and Conditions of the Tournaments, which would have been on 17/12/2023.</p>
<p>Without prior notice, on the date 17/12/2023, Leon edited the tournament descriptions, removing the information about my win, and changed the payment date to 31/12/2023. They did this in conjunction with a list of winners that was never even publicized.</p>
<p>What's really unsettling is that, after the tournament ended, and with the payment supposed to be processed 14 days later (which is already a lengthy timeframe, but I accepted it because it was mentioned in the terms), they edited the image that was recorded in my account with my position and altered the payment date to 31/12/2023.</p>
<p>Concerned about this confusion, I took and saved screenshots of my rankings along with the support team's confirmation.</p>
<p>In summary,</p>
<p>I received $500 on 20/12/2023 and $250 on 21/12/2023.</p>
<p>However, there was no notification or email telling me which tournament the winnings were from. I was still missing $300 and the money just showed up in my account on one day, then the next, without any details.</p>
<p>When I contacted support, they told me that I wasn't in the winning placement for one of the tournaments and my prize was smaller.</p>
<p>I wonder, how can they determine this? They don't publish a list of winners, the terms and conditions state that the ranking is updated in real time, and they themselves, confirmed my placements, but when it came to paying they changed the date and simply stated that my position was different, 17 days later. What? Am I crazy or am I blatantly being ripped off?</p>
<p>Attached are the photos of the terms and conditions before and after they were edited (by Leon)</p>
<p>As well as my positions before and after they were edited (by Leon)</p>
<p>And also the support team confirming my positions before and then telling me something different afterward without any explanation.</p>
