    <h1>Casinos In Kansas City Missouri Casino Florence Oregon Casino Free Play Albuquerque Casino Casinos N</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>the casino wants to collect data. I don't know any casino in Europe that needs so much data! I have already submitted the following data for verification!</p>
<p>Copy of the identity card (front-back)</p>
<p>Copy of the identity card (front and back) incl. Selfie as I hold the ID in my hand</p>
<p>Copy of the transaction from my bank 2x</p>
<p>Copy of my bank card front and back (What is bullshit, I did not pay in with a credit card with Klarna) Bank card therefore complete nonsense</p>
<p>Copy of my bank card front and back including a selfie as I hold the card in my hand!</p>
<p>I have never seen it at a casino in Europe. Cashed out at 30+ casinos. I forwarded the whole of the EU data protection officer because of a violation of data protection here in the case. Informed my lawyers. If necessary, I will file a criminal complaint or file a lawsuit for damages and breach of data protection regulations. In addition, data must be sent unsecurely via e-mail! This concerns an amount of 150 euros not 10,000 euros.</p>
<p>It is held out over and over again! This shows how the casino tries not to pay out every penny.</p>
<p>You should downgrade the casino or with the notice it requires countless data to request a payout, no matter what amount. that scares off most of the people. Rightly so!</p>
<p>The answer is always that!</p>
<p>Dear customer,</p>
<p>You have previously contacted us regarding the verification of your account and informed us that you have used Klarna Sofort to make deposits on your gaming account.</p>
<p>Please clarify whether you have linked your bank account or your bank card directly to Klarna Sofort.</p>
<p>You have also tried to withdraw funds from your account using BankTransfers.</p>
<p>Please clarify whether you entered your card or IBAN when you tried to pay out.</p>
<p>As for data protection, please rest assured that it is 100% secure. Further details on data storage and data processing can be found here https://gg.bet/de/privacy-policy.</p>
<p>With best regards</p>
<p>GG.bet customer service</p>
