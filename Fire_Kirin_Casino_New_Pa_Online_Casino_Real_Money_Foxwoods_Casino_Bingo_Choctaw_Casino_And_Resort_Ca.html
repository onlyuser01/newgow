<p>The deal was announced Thursday and will see the entry of MGA Games’ portfolio of products in Italy. Under the terms of the new collaboration, Microgame will distribute MGA Games’ premium products to online casino operators in the country. The content includes the developer’s new Italian Celebrities portfolio, as well as other localized slot content. The deal will see more than 50 Microgame customers access the unique portfolio and leverage it to their advantage.</p>
<p>“We are really proud to be the first in Italy to include MGA Games, a real giant of online gaming, among our suppliers, and to be the first to bring its sought-after specialties to the Italian market.“ Marco Castaldo</p>
<p>Marco Castaldo, Microgame’s CEO, shared his excitement about the new partnership. He acknowledged that the company is proud to be the first supplier in Italy offering MGA’s content. Castaldo added that MGA Games offer unique content including localized offerings which will be perfect for the iGaming market in the country. In conclusion, he predicted that the new partnership will broaden Microgame’s offering.</p>
<p>“We are sure that this new partnership will further distinguish our offer, the most complete in the Italian gaming industry,“ added Castaldo</p>
<p>MGA Games’ CEO, Joan Sanahuja, added that the new deal marks an important step in the company’s growth strategy for the market in Italy. Moreover, he acknowledged that the gambling market in the country is the second-largest market in Europe. Speaking about Microgame, Sanahuja deemed the company as the ideal partner. Last but not least, MGA Games’ CEO acknowledged that the new deal brings excitement for the company as prepares to enter the market in Italy.</p>
<p>“This collaboration represents an important step in our expansion strategy towards Italy, the second largest regulated market in Europe.“ Joan Sanahuja, CEO at MGA Games</p>
<p>Earlier this month, MGA Games announced another strategic partnership. The company joined forces with Fair Play Casino, which marked the debut of its content for customers in the Netherlands. Under the terms of its deal with Fair Play Casino, MGA agreed to provide 10 games with an option to increase the number later. While this deal undoubtedly expanded Fair Play’s content offering, it also helped MGA increase its footprint in Europe.</p>
