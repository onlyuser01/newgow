    <h1>Casino In Tulsa Ok Charles Town Wv Casino Online Casino Roulette Casino Hotel News 4 Winds Casino Ne</h1>

<p>A symbiotic relationship between a developing gambling market and regulatory instruments is a sign of sustainable growth, and Michigan has been on a roll lately on both fronts.</p>
<p>eCOGRA Expanding Further in the US</p>
<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) granted eCOGRA sports betting and iGaming authority to act as an Independent Testing Lab (ITL) in the state. As an ITL, eCOGRA will be able to offer its expertise in the regulatory certification of iGaming and sports betting operators in the state. This is not the first US state the lab has a presence in.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, eCOGRA has limited operations in New Jersey and Colorado, with minor vendor licenses and a business focused on third-party cybersecurity testing and certification. Michigan and Pennsylvania, however, have embraced the company as a fully-fledged ITL for gaming operator certifications. The news marks another successful step in eCOGRA’s expansion into the US.</p>
<p>“We are committed to expanding our service offering to new jurisdictions important to our clients. We will continue pursuing approvals where our services are required, being the preferred ITL,” eCOGRA’s chief executive officer, Shaun McCallaghan was cited in a report by Online Casino Reports. It seems an increasing number of US states are starting to take advantage of the lab’s expertise.</p>
<p>Michigan’s Growing Gambling Scene</p>
<p>While eCOGRA has been on the up and up itself, its US expansion is somewhat tied to the local gaming market and the US regulatory microclimate overall. This is where developments on the state level start coming into play, and Michigan fits the bill perfectly, as the state has been looking to expand its gambling market lately.</p>
<p>The MGCB has been very busy as a result, or rather – the state’s progress in this regard has been thanks to the efforts of the MGCB. NetGaming recently received its supplier license from the MGCB, commenting on the “arduous” application process, which – not at all coincidentally – involves a great deal of assessments and due diligence on MGCB’s part.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix is another entity that has kept MGCB busy and brought yet another ingredient that enriches Michigan’s offerings. EveryMatrix received its license to distribute content in the state through the CasinoEngine platform. This introduced not only more iGaming content in the state but also marked a big step in EveryMatrix’s efforts to further expand and solidify its US presence.</p>
<p>Michigan has been in industry news a lot lately, with a huge step in expanding gambling in the state officialized at the beginning of the year. The move toward sharing the Michigan and New Jersey player pools was made by PokerStars. This made PokerStars the first Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement (MSIGA) operator in the state.</p>
