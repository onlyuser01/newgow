    <h1>Slots Casino Live Casino Restaurants Casinos Miami Emerald Queen Casino In Fife Casino Pair NuxGame</h1>

<p>Amigo Gaming will be able to deploy its entire portfolio of slot games and incorporate them with NuxGame’s innovation-driven platform. The companies will work on the gradual introduction of new content to the platform.</p>
<p>More Gaming Titles to Come to NuxGame’s Platform</p>
<p>According to the official press release, Amigo Gaming wants to see anything around two or three new titles introduced to NuxGame’s platform per month. Amigo Gaming’s titles are flexible and they will allow players to pick from a range of languages, as well as a mixture of FIAT and major cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>This partnership allows NuxGame to continue bolstering its presence in iGaming and ensure that it brings worthwhile titles and products to players in its main markets, which include Southeast Asia, Central Europe, and Latin America. NuxGame is topping off previous deals with V8 Poker and LSports with the latest addition of Amigo Gaming.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new opportunity, NuxGame CRO and business development Dmitry Volkov said that the company was delighted to see Amigo Gaming contribute its games and noted that the supplier has already achieved success in many of the key markets that NuxGame itself found important. Volkov added:</p>
<p>NuxGame is confident this new offering will prove just as popular with our clients, as we continue our efforts in exceeding their expectations and providing them with an unmatched solution. NuxGame CRO and business development Dmitry Volkov</p>
<p>Amigo Gaming business development director Marga Fernandez was similarly happy to see this new alliance between the supplier and NuxGame form. It’s an important stepping stone for the company, Fernandez explained, as it would allow the studio to further expand its presence globally.</p>
<p>NuxGame has also been pushing to rapidly improve its overall platform and ensure that its iGaming operations are up to industry standards. The company has also been consolidating its regional footprint by striking specific region-focused partnerships with payment suppliers, operators, and studios.</p>
