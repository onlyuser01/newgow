    <h1>Casinos Casino Movie Pokerstars Casino Bonus Caesars Casino Michigan Tacoma Casino Free Casino Games</h1>

<p>Dear pyaephyoaung5384,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I'm sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>I checked the 1xBet Casino's Terms and Conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>9.If the customer refuses to undergo or cannot pass identity verification and/or the KYC process under applicable law, 1XBET.IE reserves the right to void their bets (including bets placed from duplicated accounts). Furthermore, 1XBET.IE reserves the right to take any reasonable measures, including but not limited to blocking the account, freezing the available funds until the customer is completely verified and their deposit methods have been checked and confirmed or even suspending or closing the account associated with unverified customers.</p>
<p>Could you please advise which documents you have already provided and when exactly did you send the last one? Have you provided all the required documents as soon as possible and in the correct format? If you are not been able to provide the casino with the identity documents necessary for verification, I'm afraid they have the right to close your account. Have you been informed by customer support if your initial deposit amount would be returned to you?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
