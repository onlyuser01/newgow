    <h1>Binion Casino Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino Aruba Free Casino Games Slots Best Western Plus Casin</h1>

<p>Anyone who has played a roulette game knows that hot numbers are numbers that have come up frequently for the last hours and cold numbers are numbers that have come up less. So, when betting, some players would bet on cold numbers, thinking that since they have not come up, then they probably will in the next hours. While this makes sense, I must also admit that betting on hot numbers is a surer way to ensure you score some wins - after all they are hot numbers for a reason. But then throw in lucky numbers and colours in the mix and it's all man for himself. What strategy do you usually adopt?</p>
