<p>Rush Street Interactive has gained entry into Ohio, Maryland and Missouri through a Penn National Gaming market access deal.</p>
<p>RSI Breaks Ground into Ohio, Maryland and Missouri</p>
<p>One of the leading iGaming and sports betting firms in the United States, Rush Street Interactive, has gained market entry into Ohio, Maryland and Missouri, moving into three new jurisdictions where the company will deliver its top-notch gambling product suites and expertise.</p>
<p>To this end, RSI has partnered up with a familiar and trusted partner, Penn National Gaming, Inc. As a result, RSI will bring its flagship BetRivers.com gaming and betting platform for a period of 20 years in all three states before renewal is necessary.</p>
<p>The company would also have a right to a second skin in each state, depending on regulatory approvals, obtained licensing permits and the availability of such skins in the first place. RSI will pay Penn National an agreed-upon industry fee in exchange for the market access. The payment should happen as soon as one of the skins launches. Meanwhile, Penn National is planning a West Virginia expansion in Q2, 2021.</p>
<p>RSI president Richard Schwartz said that his company was happy to be breaking ground in three new pivotal jurisdictions in the United States. According to Schwartz, RSI will be able to bring its “best-in-class” online gaming offering to each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Because of RSI’s already established footprint in neighboring states, Schwartz is confident that BetRivers.com would be able to build and develop its marketing efficiencies. At the same time, the company continues to seek out new expansion opportunities with commercial and tribal casinos, as well as industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>Rush Street’s Reaches to 68m Players and Bettors</p>
<p>“We expect to continue entering into additional market access arrangements in the future, as other opportunities arise,” he added. RSI’s footprint is impressive as it is.</p>
<p>The company has access to 68 million people through its already established footprint in legalized betting and gaming states, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa and Illinois.</p>
<p>RSI is equally focused on a social and recreational gaming experience on top of any traditional iGaming and sports betting. Yesterday, Penn National’s wholly-owned subsidiary Penn Interactive secured market access to the New York market through another 20-year partnership.</p>
<p>Presently, Rush Street has access to 35% of the country’s population, giving it a significant footprint in the newly-regulated gambling markets in the United States. At the same time, RSI remains a market leader in places such as New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois.</p>
