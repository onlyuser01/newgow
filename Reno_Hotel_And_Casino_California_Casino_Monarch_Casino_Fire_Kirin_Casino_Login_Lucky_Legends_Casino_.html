<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Betntflix does not pay out winnings. They say I did broke term 8 which states you can not bet more then deposit size that is needed to receive max bonus. With a 100 percent deposit bonus and max bonus of 100 euro you can bet max 100 euro. When you deposit 150 euro you can still bet max 100 euro. I did deposit first 100 euro and did lost that deposit and bonus and had empty balance. It was weekend and they have 50 percent reload bonuses with max bonus of 100 euro. I did deposit 200 euro which is needed to receive 100 euro bonus. I did not bet over 200 which was needed to receive 100 euro bonus in the case of 50 percent bonus. They only give example of 100 percent bonus in term 8 but say deposit size needed to receive max bonus. If you can also only bet 100 euro with a 50 percent bonus with max bonus of 100 then the rule is that you can max bet the same as bonus regardless if it 50 or 100 percent bonus. Which is a very simple term but that is not like their term 8 . I think they can not understand term 8 themselves when it is a 50 percent bonus in stead of 100 percent bonus and with only example given of 100 percent bonus in term the mess up when it is 50 percent bonus and you need 2 times the deposit amount for the same bonuis. It could also be they thought i was still playing 100 percent bonus which i blewfast just before the second bonus. They say it is final so I need ADR. They are stupid or pretent to be. They also said it was primarely term 8 I broke so if you agree with me they will make another excuse, probably. In Netherlands i can acces no more then like 10 bookies but I did try a few that advertise here they were all LCS limited and don't pay out. LCS limited with betnflix but also bestamigo en 21.red have now stolen in 1 month more then other bookies have in 7 years before but will open seperate cases for them.</p>
