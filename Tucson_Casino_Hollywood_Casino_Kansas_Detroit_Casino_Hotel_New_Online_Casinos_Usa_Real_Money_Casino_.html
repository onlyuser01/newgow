<p>Wynn Las Vegas has announced a new partnership with TB12, a health and wellness program that promotes a healthier lifestyle. Wynn will use this agreement to encourage its customers to live healthier lives.</p>
<p>TB12 Will Host Sessions at the Encore Fitness Center</p>
<p>TB12 is a program developed by the National Football League quarterback Tom Brady and the alternative medicine specialist Alex Guerrero. The program introduced a lineup of habits that people can implement in their lifestyle and be healthier. The TB12 Method is based on five core principles, namely pliability, nutrition, hydration, movement and mental fitness.</p>
<p>As per the agreement, TB12 coaches will provide Wynn guests with Body Coach lectures. The sessions will take place at Wynn Las Vegas’ Encore Fitness Center where coaches will provide visitors with personalized treatment plans.</p>
<p>The sessions are scheduled to begin on September 22. Interested customers may sign up now and receive access to the Body Coach sessions, as well as various bonuses such as spa services. During the sessions, visitors will be able to purchase healthy food and beverages from the Encore Juice Bar.</p>
<p>TB12 Is Excited to Work with Wynn</p>
<p>Grant Shriver, chief executive of TB12, spoke about his company’s agreement with Wynn Las Vegas. He noted that his team is excited to bring the TB12 Method to the Las Vegas Strip and inspire people to live healthily.</p>
<p>TB12 is expanding rapidly in the marketplace and as we looked for a new partner on the West Coast, we knew the Wynn could bring forward an integrated wellness program for their visitors of all ages and level of activity. We’re thrilled to bring TB12 to the Vegas strip, activating at the highest level at one of the most prestigious resorts. Grant Shriver, CEO, TB12</p>
<p>Tom Brady, co-founder of TB12, personally spoke about the collaboration with the operator.</p>
<p>After our successful collaboration with the Wynn for The Match back in June, it was a natural next step to make this partnership official on behalf of TB12. Our TB12 Body Coaches who are the heart and soul of our business and experts in the field of health and wellness will be able to provide guests the exact blueprint of the work Alex and I have been doing together all these years. Tom Brady, co-founder, TB12</p>
<p>According to Brian Gullbrants, president of Wynn Las Vegas, introducing TB12 to the resort’s customers is a new step in the company’s commitment to guests’ well-being.</p>
<p>The introduction of TB12 signifies a fresh approach to wellness at our resort. Offering guests a way to maintain their wellness goals while on-the-go demonstrates our commitment to providing unique amenities not found anywhere else in Las Vegas. Brian Gullbrants, president, Wynn Las Vegas</p>
