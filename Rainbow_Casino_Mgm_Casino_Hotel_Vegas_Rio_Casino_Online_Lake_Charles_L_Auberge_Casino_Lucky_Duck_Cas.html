<p>The long-anticipated opening date for Fontainebleau Las Vegas, the towering 67-story casino resort on the iconic Las Vegas Strip, might have just been revealed. While Fontainebleau has yet to officially announce the date, a recent report from the Las Vegas Review-Journal suggests that Wednesday, December 13, is the day when the resort will unlock its doors to the public.</p>
<p>Fontainebleau Las Vegas Overcomes Delays for December Debut</p>
<p>The Fontainebleau Las Vegas, known for its distinct blue tower, will be the first new casino resort to grace the Las Vegas Strip since Resorts World‘s debut back in June 2021.</p>
<p>Standing tall as the tallest building in Nevada, the Fontainebleau will house a staggering 3,644 hotel rooms, making it a prominent addition to the Las Vegas skyline. Additionally, it boasts over half a million square feet of convention and meeting space, with its primary exhibition area sprawling over 105,200 square feet. It’s a testament to the resort’s grandeur, as it rises from the ashes of the demolished El Rancho Hotel and Casino site.</p>
<p>The journey to this grand opening has been fraught with challenges. Initially announced in May 2005 with a projected opening in 2008, the Fontainebleau faced setbacks due to the Great Recession and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Koch Industries’ real estate investment arm, in collaboration with Miami real estate developer Jeffrey Soffer’s Fontainebleau Development, acquired the towering structure in 2021, giving new life to the iconic project.</p>
<p>In December last year, Fontainebleau Las Vegas secured a $2.2 billion loan from various banks and investors, ensuring the completion of its long-delayed project, with plans to open in 2023.</p>
<p>While in June this year, Fontainebleau Las Vegas made strategic senior-level appointments to bolster its leadership team ahead of its December opening, with Mark Tricano becoming the president, Michelle Reda taking the role of chief casino marketing officer, and Kimberly Virtuoso being promoted to senior vice president of people.</p>
<p>Fontainebleau Las Vegas Unveils Extravagant Casino, Dining, and Entertainment Options</p>
<p>Fontainebleau Las Vegas will offer a vertically integrated casino experience, much like the Cosmopolitan, with its gaming area occupying the ground floor and the second and third floors dedicated to retail and dining. The casino floor is set to feature an array of 1,300 slot machines, including multigame options with video poker, keno, and blackjack, as well as 127 table games offering blackjack and three-card poker. Enthusiasts can also look forward to a spacious sportsbook spanning.</p>
<p>The resort plans to pamper visitors with 90,000 square feet of high-end retail space, though specific retailers are yet to be announced. In the culinary department, Fontainebleau aims to delight with 27 upscale dining options, including the American restaurant Vida and Southeast Asian cuisine at Komodo, among others.</p>
<p>Entertainment seekers will be spoiled for choice with three distinct venues – a day club, a nightclub named LIV, and a massive 3,800-capacity theatre, all curated by Miami-based Groot Hospitality and nightlife guru David Grutman. Fontainebleau has already managed to lure superstar DJs Tiesto and Zedd away from Resorts World’s Zouk Group, setting the stage for thrilling nights on the Strip.</p>
<p>High above, the resort’s rooftop pool deck will offer seven different pool experiences sprawled across six acres, providing a luxurious retreat for guests.</p>
