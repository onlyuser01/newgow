<p>The re-launching of mobile sports betting services in West Virginia is confirmed to take place prior to the end of August</p>
<p>State lottery director John Myers revealed information for two sports betting apps, which are just about ready to roll-out but the dates remain unclear</p>
<p>While concrete information remains somewhat scarce it is suggested that full-out launch will come before the first full slate of college football games, starting August 31st</p>
<p>Following a 6-month interruption in services, West Virginia is ready to re-launch mobile sports betting and it seems like there’s going to be a surprise for the local audience.</p>
<p>A Scuffle in Service Earlier This Year</p>
<p>When, at first, mobile sports betting services were launched on state territory back in December 2018, the situation was presented as a temporary interruption of services. Later it became clear that Delaware North – owner of the Wheeling Island Casino in Wheeling and Mardi Gras Casino in Cross Lanes, as well as the first operator to launch a sports betting app in the state of West Virginia – had a management dispute about service provider Miomni and a third-party tech solutions vendor. This led to a law suit, which Miomni is still fighting.</p>
<p>Delaware North’s BetLucky app had a good run, results showing a $670,443 in revenue for its short, 4 month, operational period.</p>
<p>Two New Apps Borderline Ready to Launch</p>
<p>In an announcement state lottery director John Myers said that now there are two new candidates, ready to pick up on the niche. “Testing is completed on one and ongoing on another. I don’t have an official roll-out date yet,” he added. Names were not revealed but various sources point to the fact that the two involved are DraftKings at Hollywood Casino in Charles Town, as well as FanDuel, who already run a land-based sportsbook at The Greenbrier, a resort casino owned by state governor Jim Justice.</p>
<p>Though it is not confirmed, DraftKings have already tried launching a mobile sports betting app in West Virginia three months ago / in late May. The application is said to have been tested and approved but questions arose among officials in regards to a wallet server located outside of state territory, which operates with the financial information of the apps’ customers. The debate was quickly dismissed over concerns related to the Department of Justice’s revised stance on the interpretation of the Wire Act.</p>
<p>William Hill also runs a sportsbook operation in the state at the Mountaineer Casino Racetrack &amp; Resort and is also presumed to be interested in launching a mobile app. This makes perfect sense in light of their recent Android release in Iowa.</p>
<p>August 31st marks the date of the start of West Virginia’s college football games. After which, in the beginning of September, the National Football League starts its season. Both events make for the biggest rush for punters towards sports betting operators. Last years’ handles during the time made for some 45% in both Mississippi and Nevada.</p>
<p>Upcoming games for West Virginia college teams may not figure greatly on sportsbook boards, though, as both West Virginia University and Marshall University will be playing lower tier competitors.</p>
