<p>Reflex Gaming and Yggdrasil have joined hands for the release of Secret of Anubis DoubleMax, an interactive 5x3 slot with DoubleMax and Pop and Drop cascade mechanics</p>
<p>Leading gambling machine supplier in the UK purchased by Dransfields in 2019, Reflex Gaming, has paired up with iGaming publisher of premium content, Yggdrasil Gaming, for the release of Secret of Anubis DoubleMax.</p>
<p>The fresh slot is an adaptation of Reflex Gaming’s popular game played in brick-and-mortar venues.</p>

<p>Uncover the Enigmas of Ancient Egypt</p>
<p>The slot is powered by Yggdrasil’s Game Adaptation Tool &amp; Interface, which is a top-notch technology that enables partners to use preconfigured, regulation-ready, fully standardized development tools to generate premium content that can be rapidly distributed.</p>
<p>The interactive slot throws the focus on Anubis, the Egyptian God of the Afterlife, and introduces players to the Pop and Drop cascade mechanic, where at least one Wild symbol is added prior to the drop of the rest of the symbols.</p>
<p>The DoubleMax mechanic has been used to make sure that all cascades give players an unlimited win multiplier that will double its value every time a winning cascade is triggered.</p>
<p>While engaged in the base game, players can randomly trigger the Sand Storm bonus. This will remove the icons from the reels and initiate a cascade that will create a guaranteed win.</p>
<p>To enter the Free Spins Bonus round, players need to land at least three Scatters. During the round, they can receive between seven and 13 free spins, as well as the chance to gamble for additional spins during the available “all or nothing” mini-game.</p>
<p>While the Free Spins Bonus round is still active, players will continue to see the win multiplier build up, only to reset once the feature is finally over.</p>
<p>The game lets players boost their bet by 25% which will allow them to double the chances of engaging the Free Spins round. They can also choose to pay x100 the stake to purchase a bonus consisting of seven free spins.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s chief gaming officer, Mark McGinley, spoke about the “incredibly lucrative combo” provided by the special mechanics.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s chief product officer, Mat Ingram, also praised the same dynamic mechanics, calling the new slot “the complete package”. He also mentioned the maximum win potential of the game which is capped at a little over 20,000x the bet.</p>
<p>In October, the same duo released 8 Balls of Fire, following other interesting launches including Fast Fruits DoubleMax in July and Purrfect Potions in May.</p>
