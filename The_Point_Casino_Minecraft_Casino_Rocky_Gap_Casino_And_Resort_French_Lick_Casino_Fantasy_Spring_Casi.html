    <h1>The Point Casino Minecraft Casino Rocky Gap Casino And Resort French Lick Casino Fantasy Spring Casi</h1>

<p>FunFair Games continues to strengthen what is an already-impressive lineup of executives and professionals. The latest edition features the hiring of former Entain Director Mark McGinley who will be joining the company as its new chief executive officer. In his role, McGinley will continue working on the company’s mission statement which is to deliver on a new and innovative igaming experience across the board.</p>
<p>FunFair Games Ready to Scale up Content Distribution</p>
<p>He will be tasked with boosting the product roadmap as well as scaling the overall business reach. FunFair Games is planning to establish a global distribution channel for its games, feeling that its products are cutting the quality they need to be to reflect positively on the brand and its ambitions to transform the igaming industry in terms of content.</p>
<p>McGinley was head of game studios for Entain which puts him in a unique position to steer the development and distribution process moving forward. He has held several important roles that have provided him with the necessary experience as well. McGinley worked at RNG Foundy, Odobo, and Casumo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, FunFair Games COO Lloyd Purser will refocus his efforts on FunFair Ventures, the venture capital arm of the broader company – FunFair Technologies. Commenting on this appointment Purser said:</p>
<p>“Everyone at FunFair Games is thrilled to have Mark on board as his experience and contacts across the industry will be invaluable to the business.” FunFair Games COO Lloyd Purser</p>
<p>Purser added that the igaming market has shown that it’s “ripe for a new style of game,” and this is precisely what FunFair Games will seek to deliver on. To make this a reality, though, the company will now rely on McGinley to see the process through and take the offer to the next level.</p>
<p>The Right Man for the Job and Company Success</p>
<p>McGinley himself said that he was pleased to join the highly-innovative FunFair Games. He admitted that he is looking forward to helping the company grow its offer and making it known to more stakeholders. A huge part is put on the multiplayer experience, which McGinley argues is key.</p>
<p>“The multiplayer vertical has garnered a lot of attention lately, with many realizing how prosperous this area can be, and FunFair Games aims to be at the forefront of this exciting space in the industry,” he concluded.</p>
