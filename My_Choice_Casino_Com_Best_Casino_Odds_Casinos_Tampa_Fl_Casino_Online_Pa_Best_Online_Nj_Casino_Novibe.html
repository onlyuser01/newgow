<p>Novibet and Gaming Innovation Group announced their extended partnership, which will see Novibet continue using GiG’s Comply tool to automatically ensure compliance with its affiliate marketing programs.</p>
<p>Novibet Will Continue Using GiG’s Comply</p>
<p>The Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) announced on its website the extension of its partnership with Novibet – the European gaming operator – and will continue providing its Comply product to the operator. Comply is an automated marketing compliance tool that can “scan web pages for content including links, iGaming code red words and regulatory requirements,” as described by GiG in its news post.</p>
<p>The use of such tools enables operators, such as Novibet, to actively and proactively gain and remain in control of their marketing compliance. The tool is supposedly highly customizable and flexible, allowing for a high degree of fine-tuning criteria and multiple parameters.</p>
<p>Novibet’s international affiliate manager (IAM) – George Gerakanakis – was cited in the news post saying that GiG’s “Comply tool will continue to support the affiliate compliance team across the regulated markets” in which the company operates.</p>
<p>Novibet Growth Plans Coming to Fruition Soon</p>
<p>And Novibet has been keeping busy, increasing its prominence across multiple continents. The beginning of April saw Novibet signing Brian Hughes – the horse racing champion jockey – strengthening its name in Ireland. This came hot on the heels of the company announcing its intentions to go public at the end of March. George Athanasopoulos – Novibet’s chief executive officer – commented that the company has been focusing on generating “positive cash flow” in its growth strategy, as well as “efficiently entering” into new markets.</p>
<p>An essential market for Novibet’s growth strategy has been expanding its business into North America, as Mr. Athanasopoulos said while discussing the Caesars and Big Bola partnership that Novibet just announced: “The expansion of our iCasino platform into new regulated markets, including in North America, is a major pillar of our growth strategy.”</p>
<p>The Caesars deal will enable Novibet to operate in New Jersey, as well as Pennsylvania, by 2023, after acquiring all the required licenses and operation approvals. The ten-year deals will extend Novibet’s rich gaming portfolio into the US, marking a big stepping milestone for the company. As for the other important NA deal, Novibet signed Big Bola Casinos, enabling the company to extend its reach into Mexico as well. Big Bola Casinos is one of the few operators in the country with a license to provide iGaming and online sports betting services, making the $1 billion Mexican market available for Novibet to tap into, with forecasts putting the deadline sometime before the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Canadian gaming market is also on Novibet’s expansion list, with the operator has applied for a license to operate in Ontario earlier in the year, soon after the Canadian province legalized and started regulating online gambling. Launch there is also expected by the end of the year.</p>
