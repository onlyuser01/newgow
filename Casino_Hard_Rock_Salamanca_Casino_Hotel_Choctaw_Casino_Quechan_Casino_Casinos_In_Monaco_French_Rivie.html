    <h1>Casino Hard Rock Salamanca Casino Hotel Choctaw Casino Quechan Casino Casinos In Monaco French Rivie</h1>

<p>I have two complaints.</p>
<ol>
<li>Withdrawals are slow.</li>
</ol>
<p>I applied for withdrawal. Even in the current situation, there is no action from the casino side.</p>
<p>It is said that telephone authentication is required when withdrawing money, but when a call comes in from overseas, it will come without notification, so I can't call you back. Also, I don't know when it will come, so I don't have a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>The user cannot understand whether the delay is due to the number of days or the lack of phone verification. With this kind of response, I wonder if the casino here really applies for withdrawals.</p>
<p>The withdrawal limit is also quite low compared to other sites, so at least I would like you to process withdrawals like a normal casino. As a user, I am not convinced that a withdrawal takes so long when a deposit takes only a few seconds.</p>
<ol>
<li>All games are unplayable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Starting March 11, 2023, all games, including live games, are no longer playable. The galaxyno support says it's a server error, but I feel like they're intentionally stopping play.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether it really corresponds if there is no news so far. Technical support should properly investigate the cause and fix it. It's the first time I've ever been to a casino where I couldn't play due to a game error. Or rather, the support person is responding lightly, but I think it's better to be a little more aware of the problem that there is a defect that all of the company's games can not be played.</p>
<p>*I was able to play without problems on sister sites bcasino and boocasino.</p>
<p>Please take care of the withdrawal application and the game bug as soon as possible.</p>
