    <h1>Fanduel Casino Las Vegas Casino Hotel Reno Hotels Casinos High 5 Casino Sweeps Bristol Casino FanDue</h1>

<p>FanDuel announced Thursday it launched its FanDuel sports book app in Iowa, making the state the seventh US regulated jurisdiction to feature its state-of-the-art app and online experience.</p>
<p>In partnership with Boyd Gaming, the sports betting brand owned by Flutter Entertainment is bringing its industry-leading mobile app and platform to Iowa, to provide unique sports wagering experience to sports fans in the state. Iowans can now place bets across a variety of professional sport events, including football, basketball, baseball, golf, MMA, soccer and tennis, with a multitude of different betting options at their disposal.</p>
<p>In-Person Registration Required</p>
<p>The FanDuel mobile sports betting app is available for both iOS and Android platforms for residents of the state. Due to the need for in-person registration, customers who opened an account with FanDuel need to physically visit one of its two sports books hosted by Diamond Jo Casino in Dubuque and Northwood to complete their registration. After that, wagering through the app is available anywhere in the state.</p>
<p>Online and mobile betting with FanDuel is powered by International Game Technology (IGT) and its PlaySport platform. The technology provider for the B2B gaming industry recently announced it would set up a new trading team in Las Vegas to cement the market position of its leading PlaySports betting platform by adding an extra array of customer services.</p>
<p>Being one of the innovators on the sports betting scene, FanDuel was the first to offer live streaming of sporting events inside its sports betting app, as well as Same Game Parlays, allowing punters to build parlay bets utilizing betting markets from the same game.</p>
<p>Steady Market Expansion</p>
<p>The launch of FanDuel mobile and online sports book in Iowa sides the state with Colorado, Indiana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Illinois, as the sports betting operator is seeking to expand to almost any market which becomes regulated.</p>
<p>The partnership with Boyd Gaming which started back in 2018 and allowed FanDuel entry into Indiana and Pennsylvania, is also providing market access to Illinois as it includes the opening of a retail sports book at Par-A-Dice Casino in East Peoria, pending regulatory approval for land-based sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The lucrative partnership between FanDuel and Boyd Gaming saw so far, besides the mobile sports wagering app being launched in two states, the opening of retail FanDuel-branded sports books inside 8 Boyd gaming properties across the US.</p>
