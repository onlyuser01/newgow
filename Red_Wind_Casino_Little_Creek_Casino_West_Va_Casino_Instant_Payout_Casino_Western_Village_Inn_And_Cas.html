<p>Wazdan, a leader in the development and distribution of innovative content for the iGaming industry, has signed a new partnership in Switzerland that will allow the company to further boost its reach in the country</p>
<p>Wazdan has signed with Grand Casino Luzern’s digital brand, mycasino, and will bring its products to market with one of the most prominent local operators. All games will begin to be released with mycasino.ch in batches in the early months of 2023.</p>
<p>While the full release is going to come in stages, Wazdan has already launched 9 Burning Dragons in the market and has vowed to continue growing in the European market. The integration was facilitated by Wazdan’s official partner, PAF, and this is the fifth jurisdiction worldwide where Wazdan and PAF have collaborated for a content rollout.</p>

<p>Wazdan commercial director Bekki D’Agata has hailed the opportunity to see Wazdan build up its presence in yet another important market. She said that Switzerland is a “massive market focus” for the company and that Grand Casino Luzern is one of the most impressive local partners to pick from. D’Agata added:</p>
<p>Our product portfolio has been well received by the Swiss community, and we’re looking forward to our entire offering being rolled out in the coming months. Wazdan commercial director Bekki D’Agata</p>
<p>Grand Casino Luzern AG CEO Wolfgang Bliem was similarly excited about this new partnership and the opportunity. He said that Wazdan’s portfolio of games brings a number of innovative mechanics and distinct visuals that will allow mycasino to significantly expand its offer.</p>
<p>Mycasino.ch online casino director Diemo Kastner was similarly pleased with the new opportunity. Kastner said that the company was constantly on the lookout for cutting-edge content that will help the brand make all the difference when marketing its product and seeking to strike home with new players and audiences.</p>
<p>“Wazdan brings innovative titles as well as a fantastic engagement-boosting suite of tools, and we can’t wait to see how they are received by our players,” Kastner said. Wazdan has signed a number of partnerships over the past days.</p>
<p>Despite the festive season, the company has been particularly busy with securing new market entries. Most recently, Wazdan broke ground with a license in the Czech Republic, but it has not yet announced any partners. In Spain though, the company has launched with Pas.es and brought its full portfolio of game options to the market.</p>
