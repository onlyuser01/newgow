<p>Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami adventure started in the best way possible – The Soccer Messiah scored the winning goal from a free kick in the fourth minute of the stoppage time. Will we see him save the day for “The Herons” in their second game of the 2023 Leagues Cup as well?</p>

<p>Inter Miami Hoping for Another Lionel Messi Masterclass</p>
<p>Lionel Messi made his debut for Inter Miami on Friday evening, scoring the match-winner in stoppage time. He spent just about 40 minutes on the pitch, but on Tuesday, July 25, we should see the soccer GOAT play a more important role.</p>

<p>Not only is he expected to have his first start for Inter Miami, but we could also see Sergio Busquets in the starting XI. With these two guys on the pitch, “The Herons” have every right to hope for a good result against Atlanta United.</p>
<p>However, even without Messi and Busquets in the team, they’d still have a good chance against this opponent. The thing is that Atlanta UTD is one of only five teams Inter Miami’s defeated in the 2023 MLS. Can “The Herons” do it in the Leagues Cup as well?</p>
<p>Atlanta United Hoping to Up Its Form ASAP</p>
<p>Even though Atlanta United is one of the most valuable clubs in the MLS, this team hasn’t been impressive in 2023. In fact, the boys from Georgia have won only three of their last 10 games. Further, they’re coming to the Leagues Cup after two straight losses in the MLS.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that both of those happened on the road. Actually, playing away from home is something these guys seem to hate. We’re not saying this without proof. For instance, Atlanta UTD is 2-5-5 on the road in the 2023 MLS, while also being without a single win over Inter Miami in Florida.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Atlanta United Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction for this Leagues Cup game is that Inter Miami is going to win again. We think it’s going to be an even better performance than in the first round of the competition, when Lionel Messi saved the day for David Beckham’s club in the closing moments of the game. This time, we think “The Herons” will get the job done sooner.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami to win</p>
