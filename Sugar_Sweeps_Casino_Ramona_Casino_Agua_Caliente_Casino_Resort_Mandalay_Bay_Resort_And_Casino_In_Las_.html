<p>The New York State Assembly and Senate are in sync on how to expand mobile betting in the state. This past Monday, Assemblyman J. Gary Pretlow introduced a bill, A8538, to allow OTBs (off-track betting) and pro-sports venues to have mobile betting kiosks. New York’s mobile betting options would be expanded with fixed-odds horse wagering, as well.</p>
<p>New York Making Sports Betting Strides After Cuomo Ouster</p>
<p>Pretlow’s bill mirrors that of the Senate, S.7536, which was introduced by Senator Joe Addabbo on November 19, 2021. This appears to be their latest collaboration, as they oversee the racing and wagering standing commissions in the New York State Legislature.</p>
<p>Addabbo had previously pushed for stadium sports betting, but couldn’t find enough support.</p>
<p>These two legislators were key negotiators during talks that resulted in legalization of New York’s mobile betting via the state budget in April 2021.</p>
<p>New York will launch mobile betting through its nine licensed sportsbooks ahead of the 2022 Super Bowl next February.</p>
<p>The Assembly bill reads, in part, “subject to regulations promulgated by the commission, mobile sports wagering operators may enter into agreements with affiliates to locate self-service mobile sports betting kiosks that are owned, operated and maintained by the mobile sports wagering operator and connected via the Internet to the mobile sports wagering licensee’s server or other equipment used to accept mobile sports wagering at a licensed gaming facility pursuant to this section upon the premises of the affiliate. Authorized sports bettors may place account wagers, and place and redeem non-account cash wagers at such kiosks.”</p>
<p>Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium and the Mets’ Citi Field are some of the venues that could have kiosks placed on their premises. The Saratoga, Belmont, and Aqueduct race tracks would be included, as well. The same four upstate casinos will handle all mobile sports bets.</p>
<p>Approval Doesn’t Mean Immediate Launch</p>
<p>Even if the bills are approved, kiosks will not be ready for use at the tracks and sports stadiums right away. Sportsbooks would need to wait 12 months before the state approves agreements with horse tracks or the Aqueduct video slots facility.</p>
<p>This would mean kiosk betting at tracks would be possible until late 2022. The Assembly bill states that mobile sports betting kiosks at New York’s pro-sport arenas and stadiums couldn’t be authorized by the state until after 20 months following approval of the bill.</p>
