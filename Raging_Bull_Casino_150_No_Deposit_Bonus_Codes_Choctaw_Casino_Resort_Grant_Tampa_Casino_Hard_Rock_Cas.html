<p>Thoroughbred content from Parx Racing will be available at Monmouth Park and MonmouthBets web and mobile platforms</p>
<p>Supplier of data analytics and content for the global horse racing industry, BetMakers Technology Group, announced today that Parx Racing has become part of the content available on MonmouthBets.</p>
<p>New Way to Enjoy Horse Racing</p>
<p>Thoroughbred content from Parx Racing will be made available to bettors via a content rights management agreement signed with BetMakers’ Global Racing Network division. BetMakers is the exclusive provider of the technology powering Monmouth Park, as well as the only legal and regulated fixed odds wagering platform in the US, MonmouthBets.</p>
<p>Reiterating the company’s dedication “to offering bettors the best possible racing and wagering experience,” Parx Racing’s chief operating officer Joe Wilson hailed the agreement with BetMakers as a new way for the audience to enjoy horse racing in the Philadelphia region.</p>
<p>“BetMakers has been a strong technology and service partner to Parx Racing and their investment and performance in the Mid-Atlantic racing industry gives us confidence that offering our racing for fixed odds betting in New Jersey will be a win for all of Parx Racing’s stakeholders,” Wilson said.</p>
<p>Under the content management agreement, Parx Racing will be available for fixed odds betting at Monmouth Park and on MonmouthBets web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Last month, BetMakers made history by launching the first regulated fixed odds horse racing app in New Jersey. Fixed odds wagering has also been legalized in Colorado but the state is not live yet.</p>
<p>Variety of Betting Options</p>
<p>Jake Henson, chief executive officer of BetMakers Technology Group, expressed the excitement around the expanded partnership with Parx Racing that will allow access to the track’s “premium Mid-Atlantic thoroughbred racing to fixed odds betting enthusiasts in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>“Players demand variety and the offering of fixed odds betting in conjunction with traditional tote betting will meet that demand while introducing new players to horse racing,” Henson said, outlining that, combined with “a strong and growing slate of racing content,” this variety provides bettors with “an evolving betting experience with more exciting news to come.”</p>
<p>Park Racing is joining a growing list of BetMakers’ partner tracks including Delaware Park, FanDuel Sportsbook and Horse Racing (formerly known as Fairmount Park), Caymanas Park of Jamaica, Emerald Downs, Century Mile, Canterbury Park, and Monterrico and Hipodromo Chile of South America.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, a survey commissioned by Betmakers Technology Group found out that 83% of those wagering on horse racing would like pari-mutuel betting to be accompanied by fixed odds wagering systems, thus illustrating a desire for innovation in the space that is traditionally dominated by pari-mutuel systems.</p>
