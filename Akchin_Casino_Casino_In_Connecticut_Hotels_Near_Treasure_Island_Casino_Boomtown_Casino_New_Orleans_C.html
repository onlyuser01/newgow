    <h1>Akchin Casino Casino In Connecticut Hotels Near Treasure Island Casino Boomtown Casino New Orleans C</h1>

<p>I set up the account cuz I got an email saying you know no deposit needed 50 free spins off the 53 spins I made like $15 and the wager requirement was $150 I play Dragon gym on Dragon Jim they have a buy bonus selection but at 20 cents to buy the bonus was 20 bucks so I had to play it a little bit and I got it up to like $22 and then I bought the bonus feature for 20 bucks and I won like 1200 from it so I quickly met my wager requirements for $150 I then noticed that it went from like 1,000 or $900 left turn to 50 so I went and read the terms and conditions and all the rules and regulations and went and requested the payout through cryptocurrency I got an email saying that it was denied for account verification purposes to email these documents to this email address I quickly sent in the documents to the email address they provided me I then got to automated generated response email stating that the documents I sent in would not be viewed because the only time account verification forms are viewed as with a payout request and that account verifications are for only no depositing accounts and through cryptocurrency account verification isn't a requirement did any further help I could email Live Support or go to the web page and do the 24/7 support chat option so quickly email address at Limitless casino.com I was thinking a screenshot of email I got skating that the documents I sent him wouldn't be reviewed I didn't call and texted the 24/7 chat on the casinos website let him know what was going on as well sent in the ID documents that they required selfie holding my ID next to my face in a second form of identification documents and he stated that through no deposited account s have to be verified so I asked him if I should make a deposit he said yeah I received the email from the Live Support saying that through cryptocurrency account verification isn't a requirement but as soon as the bank team gets my documents I sent that they will be viewed that's just an automatic response email and make a deposit and they don't credit it to my account my email everybody hey I'm trying to verify my account here's a documents you guys require I just keep getting the same generated response through email I keep getting the Live support emailing me saying through cryptocurrency I don't have to verify my account when I talk to life support chat they say that at any time the casino can ask for ID verification documents to ensure the safety of their customers I sent them screenshots of their support team their banking teams their account verification team that says cryptocurrency account verification isn't necessary I also had a conversation with the 24/7 live chat stating that the deposit I made is pending he could see the note that says not to process it for account verification purposes meaning that they process it I wouldn't have to verify my account I've got another one saying that as soon as my account verified my deposit will be added to my account I just keep getting a run around and just keep reaching a dead end Street I've tooken screenshots of every conversation I've had with these people and how much they contradict their selves and tell me to do this so I do this and then I get a automated email saying that the documents aren't going to be viewed well why would they send an automated email if it wasn't true telling you what to do but when you try to make the payout request I'm not able to because account verification purposes so the account verification process I feel is like almost a scam because you can't request to pay out to do it and when you email the bank team they send you an automated email back saying that the documents you just sent in won't be viewed because they're only viewed with the payout request and when you talk to the life support you just get nowhere with these people</p>
