    <h1>Rivers Casino And Resort Casinos Kansas City Mo Treasure Bay Casino And Hotel Casino Tampa Fl Double</h1>

<p>Dear Bollelan12,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your delayed withdrawals.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if they were your first withdrawals in this casino?</p>
<p>Am I correct in understanding that you didn't accumulate your winnings with an active bonus and that you haven't undergone account verification since it wasn't requested of you?</p>
<p>It’s quite usual for withdrawals to take a couple of days or even weeks to get fully processed. This means that it may take some time before your money appears in your account. That’s why we advise players to be patient and wait at least 14 days after requesting their withdrawals before they submit a complaint. Assuming that you had your withdrawals approved, I truly believe it’s only a matter of time before you receive them.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
