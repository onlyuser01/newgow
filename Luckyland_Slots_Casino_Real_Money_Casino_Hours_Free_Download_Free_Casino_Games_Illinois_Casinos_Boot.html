<p>Evoplay, an innovative slots studio, has signed a partnership deal with Fortuna Entertainment Group, a leading European gambling company. The studio agreed to power Fortuna’s brands with dozens of new games.</p>
<p>Evoplay to Provide PSK Casino with Games</p>
<p>As per the deal, Evoplay will provide the operator’s Croatian subsidiary, PSK Casino, with a total of 43 titles. Those will include a whopping 31 slot games as well as 12 instant games. Thanks to the agreement, PSK Casino players will be able to access hit titles such as Jelly Boom, Ice Mania and Penalty Shoot-Out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Evoplay agreed to help PSK Casino organize various competitive tournaments for the operator’s players. Croatian bettors can expect those to roll out very soon.</p>
<p>Notably, this deal continues Evoplay’s strategy to expand across the European region. The studio recently launched in Italy and plans to foray into other jurisdictions as well. Since Fortuna owns brands in several markets across Central and Eastern Europe, the partnership will help Evoplay expand its footprint in the continent. The operator will likely add Evoplay titles to its offerings in Romania next.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Benefit Both Sides</p>
<p>Mekinic Bozo, PSK Casino’s brand and sponsorship manager, shared that he is looking forward to working alongside Evoplay. Moreover, his whole team is excited by the opportunity to provide its players with dozens of new games.</p>
<p>Speaking about PSK’s vision, Bozo said that delivering exciting products and engaging experiences is the key to the brand’s success.</p>
<p>With Evoplay now joining our impressive network of partners, we have all the resources needed to fully facilitate joyful Croatian players’ experiences. The PSK brand’s slogan: “Play Your Game”, fits well with the wide selection of Evoplay games. Mekinic Bozo, brand and sponsorship manager, PSK Casino</p>
<p>Vladimir Malakchi, the chief commercial officer of Evoplay, also shared his thoughts on the matter. He mentioned that the studio is glad to be able to work with Fortuna – one of the largest casino companies in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>That is an exciting chance for us to be presented by leaders and well-known and recognized operators in the whole market. We did our best in order to select the most performing titles in order to provide our partner’s players with top-level gaming that is fully localized and adapted to their needs. Vladimir Malakchi, CCO, Evoplay</p>
<p>Malakchi teased that Evoplay has planned various gamification activities for the remainder of 2022. He is sure that they will help Fortuna engage more players than ever. Malakchi concluded that he hopes this is the start of a long-term partnership between Evoplay and Fortuna.</p>
