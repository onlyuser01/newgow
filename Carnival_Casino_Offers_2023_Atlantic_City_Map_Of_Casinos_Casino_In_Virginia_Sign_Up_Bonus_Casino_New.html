    <h1>Carnival Casino Offers 2023 Atlantic City Map Of Casinos Casino In Virginia Sign Up Bonus Casino New</h1>

<p>Italian sports news outlet Planetwin365.news has inked a new strategic deal with Lazio Women, a local female soccer team.</p>
<p>Lazio Women Will Promote Planetwin365.news’ Branding</p>
<p>As per the agreement, the SKS365-owned news portal will sponsor Lazio Women throughout the entire 2022-2023 soccer season. The infotainment brand will be named as the team’s exclusive partner and will establish a presence at the Mirko Fersini stadium. Planetwin365’s logo will be promoted during Lazio matches including both the club’s men’s and women’s teams.</p>
<p>This agreement is an extension of Lazio and SKS365’s existing partnership, which was formed last season. Now, the two parties will join forces to launch a collaborative social network program across the soccer club’s digital outlets. Furthermore, the infotainment company will receive dedicated spots on Lazio Style Radio where a Planetwin365 expert will talk about the club’s statistics.</p>
<p>Another conjoined operation envisioned by the partnership is a new solidarity initiative that will promote diversity and inclusion among fans of the Italian team. This move is in line with Lazio’s commitment to social responsibility, which recently saw it support a local non-profit.</p>
<p>The Deal Attests to SKS365’s Commitment to Inclusion</p>
<p>Troy Cox, SKS365’s chief commercial officer, spoke on the new agreement. He said that his company is delighted to join forces with Lazio Women and support the team throughout the upcoming soccer season. Cox hopes that this partnership will bring benefits to both sides. The CCO added that the agreement will help Planetwin365.news boost its presence and reinforce its digital engagement campaigns.</p>
<p>Cox also noted that the agreement with an all-female sports team attests to SKS365’s commitment to inclusivity and diversity in pro sports. He said that sportsmanship, loyalty, inclusion, fair play and solidarity are all key values of the agreement with Lazio Women. Finally, Cox concluded that the agreement further expands his company’s relationship with the city of Rome.</p>
<p>Lazio Women representatives added that they are delighted to have Planetwin365.news join the Lazio family. According to the club, this new agreement reinforces its relationship with SKS365 and is one that will bring higher visibility to the women’s team. Lazio said that care for its players is among the club’s top priorities.</p>
<p>Around the same time last year, Pragmatic Play, one of the biggest gaming providers in the world, inked a deal with SKS365’s sports betting division, Planetwin365. This agreement helped the former company consolidate its foothold in Europe, one of its target markets.</p>
