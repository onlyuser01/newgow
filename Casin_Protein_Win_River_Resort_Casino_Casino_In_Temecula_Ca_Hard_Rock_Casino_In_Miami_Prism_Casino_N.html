    <h1>Casin Protein Win River Resort Casino Casino In Temecula Ca Hard Rock Casino In Miami Prism Casino N</h1>

<p>Okay so what you are saying is that its clear the rules contradict each other all things considered. Cause it may say that its removed upon cashout but it also states that after the required wagering is finished if the player continues playing then all wins are void. Thus leaving no way to reach a max cashout of 20x deposit. So its okay that we disregard that rule and stick with the one in the casino's benefit. I don't know the laws where this casino's servers are located but here that is called a bait and switch, and highly illegal. No self respecting casino or their team of lawyers would allow such T&amp;C to exist or they would risk losing their license to operate.</p>
<p>Just saying, in your own words that "all the rules must be followed" after previously saying there is nothing you can do that the casino isn't following one of their own rules as one of those rules is a 20x max cashout that is impossible to obtain when applied to the rest of the T&amp;C is a very generic answer and does not speak to the heart of the issue.</p>
<p>Considering my question was never answered and given the rest of the T&amp;C prevents it from ever being able to be answered its clear that only the rules that benefit the casino are the ones followed.</p>
<p>In any case, like I said before the $75 is not going to break the bank, and though I feel that what the casino is doing is not only ethically, morally, and possibly legally wrong I am done caring about the $75.</p>
<p>If you cant help with the $75 then who do I turn too for the rest of the withdraw? It sat there for around a week and a half before they took out the $75 and resubmitted it as $525. Now its been going on two weeks that the resubmitted cashout is still sitting under a requested status. Its not even "under review", or any of the other statuses they use.</p>
<p>This is an unreasonable amount to time considering they have not once emailed me asking to verify my account, if they need documents what documents, where to send them, or any other correspondence related to the cashout other than what I emailed you from the payments department. This step takes long enough and for them never to email and just leave it up to the customer to guess or assume that it will get done somehow is a very bad business practice. It should not be left up to the customer to guess what they need and where to send it or even reach out to them for that info. This stuff is up to the casino to communicate to the customer in a timely manner.</p>
<p>I will not communicate with the representatives of this casino any more than I have to. They are clearly scamming customers with their promotional material and I want no part of it. I will send them any verifying documents they need to process the withdraw but I must be told by either you or them where and what to send.</p>
<p>They did on the other hand they feel it fitting to bombard my email with more bait and switch promotions...</p>
<p>After all is said and done and I have received my rightful winnings minus $75, I will make sure to let every casino rating site know the shady business tactics this casino uses, unneeded wait times for withdraws, and generic responses from support when its clear they are in the wrong.</p>
