    <h1>San Juan Casino 12 Tribes Lake Chelan Casino Anderson Indiana Casino Kwataqnuk Resort Casino Polson</h1>

<p>My vip manager offered me a 35 euro bonus with a turnover of 1400 euro to transform the bonus balance into a real balance.</p>
<p>I had already sent the documents and everything in fact you had already made a first withdrawal so I thought that for the second there were no problems but I was refused several times I did not understand why I wrote in chat they tell me they want a screen shot of the last payment okk but my bank does not allow screen shots and so I took photos from phone to phone I will have sent a dozen until someone was accepted ... but that's not all it's already been a day when they tell me that I with my browser I have a double account and I had to explain this thing .... yes indeed every now and then my mom who opened 20 bets plays from my phone it depends she has a phone a little older and every now and then we play together so they tell me to send all the documents of my mom if not they do not accept me the withdrawal ok we send all the documents with my mom and still the withdrawal is refused 3 days have already passed and then they want this blessed screen shot as well d my mom, despite having already sent all the papers, bank statements, documents, in short, documents that are sufficient to establish that she is a person in all respects with all the papers in order but nothing they want the impossible screen shot where you have to see the transaction name and surname now and date card number all in one screen .... but this does not exist perhaps for some bank maybe yes but in the app of findomesti no !!! So my mom came in from the PC taking photos at the open bank with everything they asked for now I say if I gave you everything you wanted what changes between a phone screen shot or a PC photo? Where can you clearly see all that you have requested ??? Nothing after that I try again to make a withdrawal ah! We had also sent the bank screens from the app as many as we could with the transaction but not with everything they requested because it does not exist in the app ... you could see the card number and transaction in the app this ... as a complete overview there it was I make the withdrawal again but no withdrawal REFUSED ok I realized that this money does not want to give it to me and I was 3 days to kill my life and with the anzia because above all I also sent paper printed from the PC bank statement photos of cards in front behind but they are never enough so I decided to close because a casino that does not pay winnings is worth less than 0</p>
<p>Bad stay away</p>
