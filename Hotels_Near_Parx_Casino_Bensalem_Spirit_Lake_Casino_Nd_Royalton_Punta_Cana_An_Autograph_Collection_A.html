<p>GamblingNews recently sat down with Mattia Busuttil, the head of rest of world at PressEnter, formerly known as Betpoint. Busuttil, who joined the company a little more than three months ago, brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the platform, ready to drive its next phase of success. PressEnter has a number of iGaming platforms and is also partnered with Playson, Yggdrasil and, more recently, 1Ã—2 Network.</p>
<p>Busuttil made the switch to PressEnter after seeing what the company was achieving and where it is headed. Smaller organizations, compared to large global conglomerates, have the ability to adapt quicker to change and can introduce innovation more easily. Busuttil recognized the capabilities of PressEnter to be a pioneer in the next stage of iGaming development and is helping facilitate those changes with his experience, network and skills.</p>
<p>Now that the rebranding process has been complete, PressEnter can dedicate more resources to innovation and expansion, extending its reach across the globe. The company has expanded quickly and brought on dozens of employees recently to help it face new challenges. There is no region that PressEnter is not interested in addressing and, as it explores new opportunities, it continues to onboard new jurisdictions it can serve.</p>
<p>As others have indicated, one of the biggest challenges for PressEnter, as well as the industry, in general, is regulatory compliance. The disparity in gaming regulations from one location to the next means that operators have to be acutely aware of every aspect of their operations in order to ensure compliance. When providing services to multiple jurisdictions simultaneously, and launching in new areas, avoiding missteps is a top priority for operators.</p>
<p>PressEnter is fully embracing its new brand and will be launching a number of new initiatives in the near future. The company is ushering in a new era of global gaming and is going to ensure that it remains one of the top operators in the industry.</p>
