<p>A bill that requires people on gambling self-exclusion lists in New York to attend problem gambling educational programs prior to their removal from the lists was referred to Assembly Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Committee having passed through State Senate.</p>
<p>Problem Gambling Education Program</p>
<p>Senate Bill S4207 introduced by Sen. Joseph P. Addabbo, chair of the Senate Racing, Gaming and Wagering Committee and one of the proponents of mobile sports betting legalization in New York, recognizes the importance of educating people and providing resources to tackle gambling addiction.</p>
<p>“Problem Gambling Awareness Month serves as a reminder that gambling addiction is real and requires effective resources to educate, support and treat individuals.” Sen. Joseph P. Addabbo Sen. Joseph P. Addabbo</p>
<p>According to the provisions in the bill, a problem gambling education program developed by the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services will be made mandatory before any state resident is removed from a self-exclusion list.</p>
<p>As part of problem gambling controls, New York allows its residents to place themselves on self-exclusion lists to protect themselves from compulsive gambling behavior and excessive gambling by restricting access to gambling facilities.</p>
<p>Commitment to Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>Addabbo, who is also a sponsor of one of the two bills pushing forward with legalization for mobile sports wagering in the state, S1183, expressed his commitment to responsible gambling ahead of March Madness, prompting the new bill as necessary to raise awareness and enhance self-exclusion services for individuals exhibiting patterns of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>“With March Madness upon us, we want to inform the public about problem gambling. Every year during March Madness there is a spike in both gambling and gambling addiction helpline calls. I continue my steadfast commitment to manage gaming responsibly in New York.” Sen. Joseph P. Addabbo</p>
<p>S1183 and the other bill propped by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, A1257, featured on the respective Assembly and Senate budget proposals for 2021-2022 as state lawmakers look to cash on legal mobile wagering. Currently, residents in New York are only allowed to place bets in-person in one of the 4 upstate casinos.</p>
<p>“The expansion of gaming in NYS, including Resorts World casino in my district, demonstrates the importance of local jobs, educational funding, economic growth and also the need for educational programs that can help better inform our citizens of gambling addictions.” Sen. Joseph P. Addabbo</p>
<p>The New York Gaming Commission, state agencies, retailers and commercial casino operators launched in March initiatives aimed at raising public awareness for problem gambling to remove the stigma on problem gambling addiction.</p>
<p>”It is vitally important that we continue to provide a safe racing, gaming and wagering environment in New York.” Sen. Joseph P. Addabbo</p>
<p>The impasse related to legal mobile sports betting in New York continues, as both Assembly and Senate bills propose licensing model for sportsbook operators, while Gov. Cuomo insists on the idea to run the activity via a model similar to the state lottery.</p>
