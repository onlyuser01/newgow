<p>Strive Gaming, a B2B platform that focuses on ensuring that partners have a firm grasp of regulation and channel player engagement and growth in the fast-developing gambling market in North America, and the United States, has announced a new addition to its executive lineup. In the latest move, the company has appointed Jamie Shea as its new chief marketing officer.</p>
<p>Strive Gaming Brings DraftKings Veteran to Assist It</p>
<p>Shea is a seasoned industry veteran who has held numerous positions in the industry. One of her notable professional stints is as VP of sportsbook operations and VP of VIP marketing at DraftKings, where she played a crucial role in helping the company expand in the months and years after PASPA was overturned in 2018.</p>
<p>The decision made it possible for DraftKings and other companies to start moving towards full-scale legalization of sports betting and in places iGaming offers. Shea also worked as head of sportsbooks in Nevada and has garnered relevant hands-on experience at sports betting venues at the Venetian, Station Casinos, the Flamingo, and Hard Rock, among others. She also worked with IGT to create a new consumption platform for the United States’ market prior to her joining DraftKings.</p>
<p>She brings all of this relevant experience to Strive Gaming today to assist the company with its B2B marketing push, company communications, and more. She will also be head of the management service function, which the company shared in a press release, which has to do with risk &amp; fraud agents, customer support agents, CRM experts, and more. Shea will have to travel between the Las Vegas office in Nevada and the Vancouver office in Canada.</p>
<p>A Worthwhile Addition to Strive Gaming’s Growing Team</p>
<p>Commenting on her appointment, Strive Gaming CEO Max Meltzer said that Shea made an excellent addition to the C-level lineup for the company. He argued that establishing the company as the leading B2B provider in the North American market is an essential focus and maintaining this pole position will now be facilitated by Shea and her vast industry experience. He added:</p>
<p>Jamie understands platforms, technology, people and is a joy to work with which is why we all look forward to working with Jamie. Strive Gaming CEO Max Meltzer</p>
<p>Meltzer highlighted Shea’s relevant experience as part of DraftKings’ team, but he also hailed her expertise in managing and working in different channels of the experience, pertaining to both digital and on-premises sportsbooks in the United States.</p>
<p>Commenting on her appointment, Shea said that she was excited to be stepping into this position after DraftKings. Shea said that she believes she has the know-how to prove to operators why teaming up with Strive Gaming is an important part of their own growth and standing in the US market. “All while helping drive efficiencies internally through our managed services team,” Shea concluded.</p>
