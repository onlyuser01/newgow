<p>Huddle, a next-gen iGaming tech provider, has reinforced its leadership team with the addition of Dylan Mitchard as vice president of business development. Mitchard has years of experience in the technology and iGaming industries, which he will leverage to speed up Huddle’s growth.</p>
<p>Dylan Mitchard Joins Huddle</p>
<p>As mentioned, Mitchard has previously worked for notable companies in the tech and iGaming sectors. His career started with a tenure at GlobalData where he worked as a business development executive. Thanks to his hard work, he was quickly promoted to global business development manager.</p>

<p>As VP of business development, the new appointee will be in charge of forging key new business partnerships, helping Huddle grow and expand its reach. The company was recently supported by the casino juggernaut Las Vegas Sands and earlier underwent a merger with DeckPrism Sports, a US-based sports odds specialist.</p>
<p>Huddle Is happy to Have the New VP on Board</p>

He said that the entire Huddle team is delighted to have Mitchard join the company as VP of business development.

<p>In addition, Gaspar believes that Mitchard is a great fit for the company. The business development officer is looking forward to working with the new VP on strengthening Huddle’s business.</p>
<p>More importantly, we see him as a great cultural fit. I am honored that he will be working alongside me in building our business development vertical from the ground up. We wish Dylan all the best in his new role. Leo Gaspar, chief business development officer, Huddle</p>
