<p>Sun Palace Casino is another brand by Main Street Vegas Group. The casino launched back in 2002 alongside other flagship online casinos by Main Street. Sun Palace shares many of the features most of the other casinos in the network do, including an awesome 400% welcome bonus up to $10,000, along with a variety of Realtime Gaming (RGT) games and payment methods. Players can affect deposits and payouts quickly and with arrange of familiar options.</p>
<p>In my Sun Palace Casino Review, I have tested every individual aspect of the website, including the array of games, mobile compatibility, and games. You can play at this casino on the go and from a range of devices, but I will cover this a little later. For now, it suffices to say that Sun Palace Casino is a decent choice for US players.</p>
<p>You will find various treats at the casino, including a loyalty program, various promotions, and awesome Real Series games designed exclusively for Realtime Gaming (RTG) casinos.</p>
<p>Reputation Built Over 20 Years</p>
<p>Main Street Vegas Group has one of the most extensive lists of the longest-running casinos. Upon reviewing the group’s products I found five brands dedicated to delivering a variety of excellent games. Most casinos were launched in the early 2000s or even before that, giving the company some leeway in establishing its reputation.</p>
<p>Sun Palace Casino has been online since 2002, providing players with what seems like a fantastic selection of Realtime Gaming titles. The casino is geared towards a global audience with a particular focus on Australia, Canada, and the United States. In my opinion, this brand tries to uphold industry standards for safety and security and holds a license from the Central Dispute System (CDS), adding to its credibility.</p>
<p>Sun Palace Casino: From the Welcome Bonus to the Loyalty Program</p>
<p>My first mission as a reviewer is to hop over to the bonus section and put myself in the shoes of a new player. With a massive selection of bonuses, Sun Palace is definitely a casino you would like to visit and stick with. The selection of promotions is quite extensive, and the Sun Palace Casino welcome bonus is a great way to get started.</p>
<p>400% Bonus up to $10,000</p>
<p>The first deposit bonus at the casino is a traditional Main Street Vegas Group one. While these promotions tend to change every once in a while, the current offer provides you with a 400% matched bonus up to $10,000.</p>
<p>To trigger the bonus all you need to do is deposit $25 and punch in the Sun Palace promo code 400BONUS and you will be on your way with a hefty starter’s capital. Players who deposit $2,500 will access the full bonus amount.</p>
<p>The bonus applies to slots, scratchcards, and keno cards and you will need to subject both your deposit and bonus to a 40 times wagering requirement.</p>
<p>150% Bonus up to $7,000</p>
<p>The next bonus you can claim is the 150% match bonus up to $7,000 is listed as another option for players who are looking for a slightly smaller overall bonus. The downside here is you will get a worse match rate, but the bonus allows you to bet on your favorite games, including scratchcards, keno, and slots. To trigger the bonus you have to deposit $25 and enter SLOTS200 bonus code.</p>
<p>Enjoy a No Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>A great touch at Sun Palace Casino is the addition of a no deposit bonus. Players who are keen to get started at the casino and test around can opt for the $20 free cash and 20 free spins promo.</p>
<p>To claim the coupon you can use either the 20FREECASH or 20FREESPINS bonus code. The cash is available on all slot games whereas the free spins are earmarked for Crystal Water Slot.</p>
<p>More Promotions by Sun Palace Casino</p>
<p>Apart from the awesome freebies you can get on your way in, I have reviewed and studied the other promotions you can get at Sun Palace Casino. The operator packs an extensive variety of options, including the Double Match Up Monday, Cashback Monday, Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays: T-Blend, Wild Wednesday, and Triple Weekend.</p>
<p>If you have played at other Main Street Vegas Group brands recently, you will notice that there is a lot of overlap in the available bonuses. Outside of these promos, I have found an awesome $1,000 weekly reload, as I have at other casinos by the same group, in fact, a refer-a-friend promo, and a dedicated loyalty program.</p>
<p>One small but understandable downside of the promotions is that you need to be a registered user to explore the Terms and Conditions. Now, if you are just fishing for a good casino, you will probably want to collect more information before registering. However, I do believe you will find that Sun Palace Casino does offer what most players want.</p>
<p>Casino Games and a Real Series Slot Experience</p>
<p>Having pioneered a variety of games, Realtime Gaming is one of the best suppliers in the North American market. While the studio was in a bit of a standstill a few years back, RTG has been spiffing up its offer recently, and specifically with the introduction of the Real Series slots.</p>
<p>The unique series of slot machines enjoys touched-up graphics, more game features, and a busier release schedule. The casino has an extensive selection of new titles and a very special bonus to cover your adventures in these games. A special bonus offers to match your deposit by 200% and throw in free spins for Achilles Deluxe, the latest Realtime Gaming available to players.</p>
<p>I noticed that the New Games section is one of the quickest growing ones at Sun Palace Casino and this is by design. RTG’s team has truly stepped its efforts to provide you with a wholesome gaming variety, and that means variety. Here are some of the games to include:</p>
<p>Wild Hog Luau</p>
<p>Cash Bandits 3</p>
<p>Achilles Deluxe</p>
<p>5 Wishes</p>
<p>Diamond Fiesta</p>
<p>Vegas Lux</p>
<p>Magic Mushrooms</p>
<p>The selection of online slot games is quite extensive and doesn’t stop there. You will find other awesome games by the studio such as Dr. Winmore, Storm Lords, T-Rex, Halloween Treasure, The Mariachi 5, and more.</p>
<p>Realtime Gaming surprises with some titles that have unique gameplay, so much that they are listed under another category altogether. You will be remiss not to try Banana Jones, try Scuba Fishing, or play Fish Catch.</p>
<p>The casino’s portfolio has only been improving over the last years and always for the better. Besides, I have noticed several progressive jackpot games you can try and win over $1 million on occasion. It does sound good to me.</p>
<p>Stacking the Table Games Portfolio High</p>
<p>Another excellent opportunity to showcase Sun Palace Casino’s commitment to players is to take a look at the existing portfolio of table games. Often ignored by casinos, table games are very entertaining and Realtime Gaming has spent a lot of time developing excellent products.</p>
<p>In fact, I don’t think playing at Sun Palace would feel as fulfilling were it not for the extensive selection of table games. There are over 20 quality table games to try ranging from card games to roulette tables. Specifically, you can try:</p>
<p>Baccarat</p>
<p>Blackjack Perfect Pairs</p>
<p>Caribbean Draw Poker</p>
<p>Face Up 21</p>
<p>Pai Gow</p>
<p>Pontoon</p>
<p>Craps</p>
<p>Vegas Three Card Rummy</p>
<p>The selection doesn’t stop here and Sun palace is in the habit of adding more relevant games such as Let m Ride, European Blackjack, and other great additions to make your experience worthwhile.</p>
<p>Video Poker and Great Payouts</p>
<p>It is true. While I am not a fan of video poker myself, I can certainly appreciate the contract that exists between casinos and players. Video poker is one of the most ambitious games out there as it offers generous return to player (RTP) rates, often above 99%. Realtime Gaming’s selection of titles is spot on with games such as:</p>
<p>Aces Eights</p>
<p>Deuces Wild</p>
<p>Bonus Poker</p>
<p>Loose Deuces</p>
<p>Seven Wild</p>
<p>Joker Poker</p>
<p>There are of course others to choose from with close to 20 dedicated video poker titles that will make the experience a hoot and a half for you. Now, video poker is a game that will invite both skill and luck and give you a feeling of satisfaction once you master the paytables to your advantage.</p>
<p>Banking Options: How to Deposit and Withdraw</p>
<p>Lucky for you, Sun Palace Casino makes it very easy to transact money to and from the casino. I found the banking section to be transparent and processing times to be reasonable. Put another way, you should have no trouble depositing and withdrawing.</p>
<p>Each method will have somewhat different conditions, but it will be worth it nevertheless. Here is a brief overview of how you can deposit and withdraw from Sun Palace Casino.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>To deposit you can use several payment methods. Neteller may also be available based on where you are playing from. For the rest of the payment options, you should always have these available:</p>
<p>Visa – $20/$5,000</p>
<p>MasterCard – $20/$5,000</p>
<p>American Express – $20/$5,000</p>
<p>Bitcoin – $5/$500</p>
<p>No fees apply to any of the listed payment options, making for worry-free transactions and the best bargains you will get on any casino.</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>To withdraw from Sun Palace, you will once again have a selection of trusted payment methods. They offer decent limits as well as zero fees to make your withdrawing experience great:</p>
<p>Check via Mail – $150/$399</p>
<p>Check via Courier – $400/$2,500</p>
<p>ACH Direct Deposit – $150/$1,250</p>
<p>Bitcoin -$150/$5,000</p>
<p>There is a weekly $2,000 withdrawal limit and an $8,000 monthly withdrawal limit. However, you can increase the limits by climbing up the Loyalty Program. A regular user can only withdraw $2,000 per week, but you will be able to withdraw $5,000 each week for a Platinum and Diamond user.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can expect your transactions to be processed within 48 hours for most payment methods. However, keep in mind that some methods, such as check and ACH Direct Deposit may take up to several business days.</p>
<p>Sun Palace Casino Mobile</p>
<p>Now, I always like to test a casino from multiple gaming devices. It allows me to fully study and get a feel of a casino before I reach any conclusion. Sun Palace Casino mobile just feels great. I tried the casino on several operating systems and devices, and it always worked well:</p>
<p>Android</p>
<p>BlackBerry</p>
<p>iPad</p>
<p>iPhone</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Tab</p>
<p>Now, you can even play from a Kindle, but the device naturally has fewer operating capabilities so it might not be the best choice. Sun Palace has a great instant play platform, though, and you can rest assured that Android or iOS, you will have a neat experience playing on the go.</p>
<p>Sun Palace Casino also comes with a dedicated Android app. You can download the app directly from the website and install it with a single click. You will have to authorize Unknown Sources first for the installation setup to proceed.</p>
<p>Check Out the Customer Support</p>
<p>If you do need to get in touch with customer support, you can contact the helpline 24/7 via the live chat. Furthermore, you can leave a message to email [email protected] and expect a prompt response. There is even a brief FAQ section to help answer some of your immediate questions.</p>
<p>A Final Word about Sun Palace Casino</p>
<p>It’s always exciting coming to the end of a review. With my Sun Palace Casino review, I explored every aspect of the platform’s features. Powered by Realtime Gaming, Sun Palace is one of the oldest gaming options players can enjoy today.</p>
<p>With close to 20 years in business, you will find the casino to be one of the most trusted and popular online platforms for US players. There are tons of awesome promos to choose from and games that are definitely worthwhile. The best part is that you are free to choose what games to play and what bonuses to play.</p>
<p>Whether you are a casual player or a Platinum high roller, Sun Palace Casino will have a place for you.</p>
