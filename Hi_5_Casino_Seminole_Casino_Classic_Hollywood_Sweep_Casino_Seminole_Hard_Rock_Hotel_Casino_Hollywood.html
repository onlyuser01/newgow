    <h1>Hi 5 Casino Seminole Casino Classic Hollywood Sweep Casino Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood</h1>

<p>Was referred by a friend on January 16th to Kineko Casino and Sportsbook and deposited by eth same day to begin playing. Played heavily for 3-4 days until I began to wait on my withdrawals.</p>
<p>My very first withdrawal request (1.5 eth / 3803.03 USD) worked just fine. My subsequent withdrawals totaling 15,212.1 USD at the time (eth value) were not paid out. I sent a message to live chat to ask when they might be sent and in the morning via email I was told:</p>
<p>"Hi</p>
<p>Just had this message back from the management team regarding your account</p>
<p>An investigation by the management team has confirmed you have multiple accounts</p>
<p>This is strictly against our T&amp;C</p>
<p>As a result your withdrawal has been cancelled and your account has been blocked</p>
<p>As you have already withdrawn more than your deposits the account has been nullified and has a zero balance</p>
<p>There will be no further communication on this matter which is now closed"</p>
<p>I promptly replied letting them know I do not have multiple accounts, I was referred by someone who lives in my complex but we do not live in the same unit but we do share a common free wifi in the lobby / common areas of the apartment complex. I was never asked for any ID to verify who I was or anything like that.</p>
<p>The only reply I have got in response to this was:</p>
<p>"I can only repeat the above message as I have no access</p>
<p>I am on support, it is the management team who have done the investigation and having reached a conclusion they now have closed the matter and will not comment further"</p>
<p>There is only one agent who runs the entire live chat support. He is not able to give me the contact information to anyone else in this management team to ask what has happened or to try to explain the situation or anything like that. My remaining funds of 5760.04 USD that was as balance in the account at the time was also zeroed out.</p>
<p>A total of 20972.14 USD between cancelled withdrawals and zeroed out balance and I can't even get a proper explanation or speak to anyone regarding the matter. Looking for any assistance in this matter possible.</p>
