<p>The Finnish National Lottery’s subsidiary, Fennica Gaming, announced a new partnership, expanding further the reach of its trailblazing digital technology. On Thursday, the company announced a deal with the German lottery operator, offering its services in the state of Hessen, Lotto Hessen.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new partnership, Lotto Hessen will benefit from Fennica Gaming’s range of advanced eInstants, delivering new experiences for its growing customer base. Per the new deal, the lottery will integrate digital solutions, expanding its portfolio.</p>
<p>The introduction of new games by Lotto Hessen will be facilitated via Fennica Gaming’s state-of-the-art cloud platform and game engine, also popular as games as a service (GaaS). The platform will enable the operator to benefit from innovative technology that ensures it is always up to date and meets the high security and quality standards of the gambling vertical.</p>
<p>Moreover, thanks to GaaS, Lotto Hessen will be able to quickly deploy new and engaging games for its customers. Expanding its offering is expected to boost the German lottery’s operations, while at the same time, expanding the reach of Fennica Gaming’s leading technology.</p>
<p>Although the integration of the content from Fennica Gaming has started, it might take a few months until Lotto Hessen brings the new content to its customers. Once the process is completed, customers of the lottery can expect engaging content at some point this summer.</p>

<p>Joni Hovi, Fennica Gaming’s SVP, said that the company is delighted to team up with Lotto Hessen which is the first lottery in Germany to integrate its eInstant games portfolio. “Today we are happy to start a new era in our cooperation and we believe that our games will be a great fit for Lotto Hessen and that they will provide hours of excitement and entertainment to their customers,” he added.</p>
<p>“We believe that Fennica Gaming’s cutting-edge games will be a great success and will keep our customers engaged and entertained for years to come.“ Alexander Sausmikat, EVP at Lotto Hessen</p>
<p>Alexander Sausmikat, Lotto Hessen’s EVP, added the lottery is excited to sign the new deal with Fennica Gaming and deliver new forms of engaging and responsible entertainment for its customers. Speaking about the negotiations, he said that the process “was smooth, following the industry standards in corporate governance, compliance and integrity.” Finally, Sausmikat predicted that the new collaboration will deliver success for the lottery and Fennica Gaming.</p>
