<p>Circa Sports partnered with Full House Resorts, which will operate the upcoming American Place Casino in Waukegan</p>
<p>Circa Sports Illinois has received its license to operate in the state, marking a significant milestone in the eagerly awaited launch of legal sports betting in Prairie State. The Nevada-based sportsbook operator obtained its sports wagering management services provider license from the Illinois Gaming Board on April 27 in Chicago, granting it the authority to offer online and in-casino betting services.</p>
<p>Anticipation Builds as Circa Sports Prepares for Late August Launch in Illinois</p>
<p>This approval positions Circa Sports Illinois as one of the eight licensed sportsbook operators in the state. With this crucial step complete, the operator is now on track to debut in the third quarter of 2023, specifically targeting a late August launch, just in time for the start of the football season.</p>
<p>Circa Sports has partnered with Full House Resorts to provide both retail and online sports betting platforms for the upcoming American Place Casino. As the main casino is still under development, Circa Sports will be temporarily located at “The Temporary” in Waukegan until the completion of the probationary stage required by the Illinois Gaming Board to receive a nonrestricted casino license.</p>
<p>The sportsbook’s launch is eagerly anticipated, as it promises to offer a diverse range of betting options on various sporting events. In addition to the sportsbook, American Place Casino plans to enhance its offerings by expanding operating hours and increasing the number of table games available to patrons.</p>
<p>The introduction of the sportsbook is expected to attract a larger customer base and contribute to the overall lively ambience at American Place Casino.</p>
<p>Illinois Considers Legalizing Online Casinos</p>
<p>Circa Sports partnered with Full House Resorts to enter the Illinois sports wagering market back in May 2022. Illinois marks the fourth state where Circa has expanded its operations, following Nevada, Iowa, and Colorado.</p>
<p>The initial agreement term is eight years, with the potential for two four-year extensions. The CEO of Circa, Derek Stevens, expressed excitement about bringing their market-leading solutions to Illinois, highlighting the state’s status as a rapidly growing market in the sports betting industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in February Illinois State Senator Cristina Castro introduced bill SB1656 to legalize online casinos in the state. The proposed legislation would allow casinos and racetracks to apply for internet gaming licenses, with a $250,000 cost per license.</p>
<p>The bill set a 15% tax rate on adjusted gross revenue and included provisions for responsible gambling and diversity efforts. While a previous attempt to legalize online casinos failed, the success of sports betting in Illinois has made lawmakers more receptive.</p>
<p>The introduction of online gambling could provide a much-needed revenue stream, but it may face challenges due to existing tax revenue from video gaming terminals and the upcoming launch of new casino venues.</p>
