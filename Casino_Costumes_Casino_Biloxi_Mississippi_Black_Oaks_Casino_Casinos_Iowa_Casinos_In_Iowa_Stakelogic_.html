    <h1>Casino Costumes Casino Biloxi Mississippi Black Oaks Casino Casinos Iowa Casinos In Iowa Stakelogic</h1>

<p>Stakelogic is in fine fettle this week, as the supplier of innovative content for the iGaming vertical continues to dish out one successful partnership after the next.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration includes Swedish operator ATG, a popular brand in the local market, which will significantly benefit from Stakelogic’s expansive portfolio of online slots, with the supplier pushing both classic and modern games and stacking the library with fresh experiences for players to explore.</p>
<p>ATG players will have the opportunity to check out a variety of entertaining slot options, with popular picks such as Wild Wild Bass 3, Wild Hogs, and Rooster Mobs among some of the most popular titles here. Stakelogic has a reputation for building unique games that draw inspiration from traditional gaming mechanics as well as modern reinterpretations of slot games.</p>
<p>The company is also bringing its Super Wheel mechanic to the offer, which will power up the gameplay and add a distinctiveness to ATG’s portfolio as well.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Sales Manager Neil Tanti was similarly pleased with this opportunity, arguing that Sweden is an important market, and working with a company such as ATG is an important step forward for the company to further expand its reach in the region.</p>
<p>"Players in Sweden demand the best from their online casino content, and we believe our unique brand of online slot action provides them with exactly that," Tanti said.</p>
<p>ATG Head of Sports and Casino Christian Erlandsson was similarly pleased with this development and said that Stakelogic was indeed an important supplier of casino games that the company was very happy to be working with.</p>
<p>Stakelogic made several big moves this week as well, with the company appointing Edgars Isajevs as Head of Live Casino, one of the core business units of the Stakelogic brand. The company similarly confirmed that it has been able to break ground in Ontario with the help of Rootz, a local, licensed and respected brand that is quickly building its presence as well.</p>
