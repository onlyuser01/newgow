    <h1>Bear River Casino Hotel Live Social Casino Green Valley Ranch Casino Best Western Plus Casino Royale</h1>

<p>The fast-growing and globally-recognized gambling technology company, Playtech, announced it strengthened its European presence via a new partnership with the popular Swedish online casino and betting operator, Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino. Playtech unveiled details regarding the new collaboration Wednesday and confirmed that the tie-up further expanded the company’s position within the regulated gambling market in the country.</p>
<p>Per the new deal, Svenska Spel supercharged its poker offering by launching Playtech’s iPoker network and poker product. The launch was a part of the operator’s ongoing strategy for innovation within the poker vertical, the company said. Thanks to the aforementioned launch, Svenska Spel’s customers can now benefit from Playtech’s product that provides options for more tournaments, as well as bigger prize pots.</p>
<p>The collaboration builds upon a strong foundation between the duo. Initially, Playtech and Svenska Spel joined forces back in 2019. That deal saw the leading gambling technology provider become an exclusive poker partner of the Swedish gambling operator.</p>
<p>The Deal Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Fredrik Hard, Svenska Spel’s head of poker and bingo, shared his excitement about the latest partnership and acknowledged that Playtech’s technology brings benefits to poker players. He outlined that the technology delivers new and engaging experiences for the passionate poker fan base in the country. Finally, Hard noted: “This deal is a great proof of the quality of Playtech’s offering and we hope to see this relationship go from strength to strength in the future.”</p>
<p>“Launching Playtech’s poker offering is a great step forward for Svenska Spel.“ Fredrik Hard, head of poker and bingo at Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino</p>
<p>The collaboration with Svenska Spel represents an important milestone for Playtech. This is because only recently, the company secured its business-to-business permit for the country, required under a new regulation that is expected to come into force. At the same time, the collaboration helps expand poker, which marks one of Playtech’s important verticals.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be expanding our very successful partnership with Svenska Spel and increasing our presence across Sweden.“ Marat Koss, VP of interactive gaming at Playtech</p>
<p>Marat Koss, Playtech’s VP of interactive gaming, explained that the company is excited to expand its successful deal with Svenska Spel. He pointed out that the collaboration will help boost the company’s presence in the country while delivering engaging and entertaining options for poker fans. Finally, Koss said that Playtech is delighted to see the operator leverage its iPoker products.</p>
