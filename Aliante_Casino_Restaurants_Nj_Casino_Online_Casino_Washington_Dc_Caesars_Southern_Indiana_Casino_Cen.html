<p>As the Casino Guru Awardsceremony approaches, we sit down with one of the nominees for "The Best Implementation of RG Tools" category. Rasmus Kjaergaard, Mindway AICEO, tells us more about his company’s reach in the industry and the tools it has developed to help address a glaring problem with a brand-new approach that involves neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and expert human assessments. Here is how Mindway AI makes history and raises the standards in the industry.</p>
<p>Q: It’s an absolute pleasure to speak with Mindway AI today as one of the most prominent examples of how technology can be leveraged to strengthen responsible gambling. Can you tell us what you have learned about problem gambling in your ten years of neuroscience research?</p>
<p>What we have found is that to utilize the strength of AI for RG in terms of big data analysis and finding patterns for the detection of at-risk and problem gambling the algorithm needs a very strong target. In parallel gambling behavior is an individual matter of each and every gambler, thus there is no ideal target in any data set we can ask the algorithm to use as a strong target. To come across this problem we have invented our patent pending approach we call the GameScanner® "Virtual Psychologist". Here we combine human RG psychologists’ assessments with Machine Learning. Algorithms, as the bespoke strong target. We do this with a very high accuracy, which opens for a far more individualized and early detection, monitoring, and intervention of at-risk and problem gambling behavior. So to speak, AI for RG with a human touch.</p>
<p>Q: Do you believe there is sufficient research done in the industry to help understand customers’ gambling journey and do you think the industry tends to aggregate rather than address each customer individually?</p>
<p>We firmly believe that there can never be enough research in areas such as gambling and gambling behavior, where there is a real risk of people developing serious issues. We do acknowledge that there is being researched a lot into this field and that operators often donate a lot into research purposes, which is applaudable. We have also noticed a lot of great actions being taken, however, as you mention, the industry may tend to look at its aggregated player base instead of focusing on the individual player’s gambling behavior.</p>
<p>This is one of the key points where we differentiate from other solution providers. Our GameScanner’s Virtual Psychologist approach for instance provides an overall view of the operators’ entire customer databases, however, operators are also presented with an individualized and very comprehensive dashboard view of each and every player in their database. This enables the operators to take tailored action to every specific customer based on the customer’s individual gambling behavior, which will provide a higher success rate in regards to them regaining their footing.</p>
<p>Q: How has Mindway AI helped make the gambling industry more responsible over the past ten years, and what are some of the significant milestones you are proud of to this day?</p>
<p>Mindway AI has existed since 2018, but it has its roots as a Danish university spin-off project that has lasted more than a decade. Since 2018, Mindway AI has helped aid everything from end-users to Operators and Regulators. We have done this by providing operators with tools to help their customers, and by helping shed light on the big issue concerning problem gambling. For instance, we have presented our solutions to the Danish Parliament. One of our key milestones is definitely back when we reached active monitoring of 1 million active monthly users.</p>
<p>In retrospect, this is of course a small number compared to the 6.5 million we currently monitor in 18 different countries. The fact that we, a small tech start-up, can help more than 6 million active users maintain a healthy gambling habit is a great feeling. Another big pat on the back from the industry, which is something we are very proud of, is the wide array of awards we have been lucky enough to win. Lastly, our article in NY Times regarding responsible gambling in online casinos is also a proud moment, since such a big newspaper noticing us is a testament to how huge the possibilities of neuroscience and responsible gambling is.</p>
<p>Q: Is the key to preventing to solving problem gambling once and for all truly in the neuroscience and neuroimaging research you conduct?</p>
<p>We believe that the early individualized, automatic detection of at-risk players is an immense game-changer in the industry regarding responsible gambling. This is doable on the back of neuroscience and neuroimaging. The GameScanner® identifies at least 87%[1] of problem gamblers that professional psychologists also identify as being problem gamblers. This is a testament to how precise and effective neuroscience and neuroimaging can be.</p>
<p>Our solutions identify potential at-risk players at an early stage and very effectively, however, there can never be enough tools in the fight against problem gambling. An important tool against problem gambling for instance is legislation. Regulators around the globe have exponentially increased their focus on responsible gambling, which in turn forces operators to take more measures in the fight against problem gambling. This is a key factor in solving the global, big issue concerning problem gambling since it increases awareness, research, and therefore customer protection as an end-product.</p>
<p>Q: Why do you think Mindway should win the "The Best Implementation of RG Tools" distinction this year?</p>
<p>Mindway Ai should win this big distinction since we are an industry-leading RG solution provider, that has proven to fulfill the exact requirements of the operators we are doing business with. We work with significant operators like Entain, Flutter, Holland Casino, Lotto24, and many others in a lot of jurisdictions, incl. also the jurisdictions considered the most regulated, e.g., the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden etc. We always collaborate and make sure the implementation of our RG tools happens as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>We are constantly being told by our business partners that our solutions work very effectively and are very easy to use. Furthermore, it is greatly appreciated that our solutions are tailored to our customers. For instance, Gamalyze can be deployed with partly or fully white labeling to match the operator’s graphical profile, and the GameScanner® solution can be tailored to the operator’s exact customer database, by allowing experts to look at a sample set of their data. Therefore, Mindway AI has the Best Implementation of RG Tools.</p>
