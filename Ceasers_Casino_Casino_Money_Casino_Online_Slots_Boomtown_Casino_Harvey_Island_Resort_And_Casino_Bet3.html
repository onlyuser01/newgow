<p>The Arizona Department of Gaming will award Fubo’s former license to bet365, just as earlier rumors claimed. As a result, the international gaming giant will foray into the Grand Canyon State, expanding its presence in the United States.</p>
<p>For reference, Fubo Sportsbook, the former partner of the Ak-Chin Indian Community, ceased its operations in Arizona following its parent company’s shutdown of the brand. The closure followed Fubo’s strategic review of the division that determined none of the potential investors would have given the brand the freedom it needed.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, the Ak-Chin Indian Community was left without a partner, freeing up the space for bet365’s arrival. Earlier reports correctly suggested that the former Fubo license would be handed to either bet365 or Fanatics.</p>
<p>Bet365 will now have to make its launch in Arizona within 180 days of the day it was approved for a license (August 29).</p>
<p>Arizona had two more available sports betting licenses but failed to find suitable companies within the application period.</p>
<p>Bet365 Continues to Grow in the US</p>
<p>Bet365 is currently live in five US states, namely Colorado, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio and Virginia. The international operator is also set to launch in Kentucky with Sandy’s Racing &amp; Gaming, a joint venture between the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and Revolutionary Racing Kentucky.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, bet365 gave up on pursuing an online license in Massachusetts. Initially, the company had unveiled a partnership agreement with Raynham Park, hoping to capitalize on opportunities in the state. However, the operator eventually discarded these plans.</p>
<p>The Operator Is Going from Strength to Strength</p>
<p>In other news, bet365 recently bolstered its content offering in the Canadian province of Ontario thanks to a partnership agreement with Bragg Gaming. As per the deal, Bragg agreed to provide the operator’s Canadian operations with games from its Atomic Slot Lab and Indigo Magic studios.</p>
<p>Speaking of new content, bet365 just joined forces with NoLimit City to roll out a new exclusive slot called Apocalypse Riders X. The game features three of the developer’s exclusive mechanics, namely xWays, xNudge and xSplit, as well as a brand-new mechanic called xBomb.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, bet365 also unveiled a new marketing campaign under the slogan “Never Ordinary.” The advert celebrates contemporary sports and was released ahead of the Premier League match between Burnley and Manchester City.</p>
