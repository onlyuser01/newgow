<p>The leading provider of slot games, scratch cards and games offering unique prizes, Hacksaw Gaming, continues to expand its presence in Europe. The company said Thursday it joined forces with StarCasinò, a famous operator in Italy that is a part of The Betsson Group.</p>
<p>The new collaboration sees Hacksaw Gaming expand further its Italian and European footprint. Under the terms of the new deal, the leading developer agreed to deliver some of its most popular games for StarCasinò customers in the country.</p>
<p>Such titles include Hand of Anubis, Stack 'em, as well as Wanted Dear or a Wild. Per the new deal, the company confirmed it has already launched the aforementioned titles for the casino operator. Still, Hacksaw Gaming acknowledged that it plans to expand the partnership in the upcoming weeks and bring even more games for StarCasinò in Italy.</p>
<p>Stefano Tino, StarCasinò's Managing Director, shared his excitement in a statement released on January 26, 2023, saying: "The arrival of Hacksaw confirms our will to make StarCasinò a reference point for all online gaming enthusiasts through an increasingly innovative, wide-ranging and engaging offer."</p>
<p>He explained that the company's offering continues to grow and pointed out that in 2022, StarCasinò introduced more than 1,100 new games from 7 global providers. This, according to Tino, boosted the popularity of the brand as it enjoyed a high rate of customer loyalty and engagement.</p>
<p>Moreover, he said that the variety of games from leading developers helped with customer acquisition as well. Finally, Tino said that StarCasinò will continue to expand its offering and deliver unique experiences for its customers throughout the whole year.</p>
<p>Gabrielle Star, Hacksaw Gaming's CCO, was similarly excited and acknowledged that the company enjoys strong demand for its products in Italy. She added: "This was the latest territory that we've begun operating in and to announce the expansion by going live with StarCasinò within one month of launching in the market is a proud moment!"</p>
<p>In conclusion, Star pointed out: "We are looking forward to working together in this partnership and making Italy the next big thing for Hacksaw Gaming."</p>
<p>The recent collaboration comes after only recently, in December, Hacksaw Gaming entered the regulated gambling market in Italy with 888. Looking at expanding further in Europe, the company has decided to enter the country, where leading gambling operators have already established their presence.</p>
<p>Thanks to the collaboration, Hacksaw Gaming introduced its leading games for 888casino customers in the country, expanding further the game library of the operator. At the same time, the company benefitted from engaging with new audiences.</p>
