<p>EveryMatrix's JackpotEngine and BonusEngine will also be integrated into BetKing's platform</p>
<p>Online casino gaming software provider EveryMatrix announced today that its CasinoEngine platform went live with KingMakers’ betting brand BetKing via a single integration.</p>
<p>The Partnership Bears Fruit</p>
<p>The integration of EveryMatrix’s CasinoEngine into BetKing’s platform is set to enrich the product offering for Nigerian online casino players with the industry’s largest casino content library. It is the result of a three-year deal agreed between KingMakers and EveryMatrix in November 2022.</p>
<p>Commenting on the integration, the head of gaming at KingMakers, Lauren Holder, paid attention to the period between signing the deal and going live now, outlining that it “has been a very smooth process” and a pleasure to work with the team at EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>The Nigerian and wider iGaming African market is an area we believe has huge promise and, together with EveryMatrix’s leading productivity platform and the wide variety of flexible content options and revenue-boosting functionality it offers, we believe the opportunities are endless. Lauren Holder, head of gaming, KingMakers</p>
<p>Providing BetKing with its iGaming platform and an ever-growing portfolio of online casino games, EveryMatrix will help the KingMakers’ brand grow into a world-class, multi-vertical digital entertainment provider. Among EveryMatrix’s recent additions to the platform was the integration of Amplifier AI from Future Anthem.</p>
<p>‘The Sky Is the Limit’</p>
<p>The head of CasinoEngine at EveryMatrix, Stian Enger, hailed the integration with BetKing and its limitless potential for the business, eager to help the pan-African betting and gaming brand grow and achieve its objectives in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“The sky is the limit in terms of potential for BetKing and we’re very excited to go live and accelerate the brand’s casino growth in the months and years to come,” Enger said, outlining that as BetKing is now the leader in sports betting market share in Nigeria, in no time it will achieve the same growth with casino, boosted by CasinoEngine’s capability to acquire and keep customers.</p>
<p>To further boost the gaming experience for its Nigerian players, BetKing will also integrate EveryMatrix’s JackpotEngine and BonusEngine solutions, bringing jackpot customization and a wide range of player reward and bonus management features.</p>
<p>The JackpotEngine, a jackpot management system allowing gambling companies to create, customize and manage their own jackpots, has been recently certified by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA).</p>
<p>Nigeria has a legal gaming market estimated to be worth €560 million ($602 million) in gross gaming win in 2023 by gambling research agency H2 Gambling Capital. Analysts further believe that the market has the potential to double in the next three years.</p>
