<p>The former athlete reportedly plans to take a guilty plea to driving under the influence in relation to a car accident which resulted in the death of a young woman</p>
<p>Henry Ruggs III was the first-round NFL draft pick and back in 2021, he inked a multi-year deal with the League that was believed to be worth more than $16 million. Ruggs also played an important role with the Las Vegas Raiders as a wide receiver.</p>
<p>At the time it looked like the young man had a bright future ahead of him, but that all changed after a car crash that resulted in the death of a young girl. It is believed that the former athlete was driving at a speed of up to 156 mph. After the incident, the Raiders ended their deal with Ruggs as he faced different charges related to the crash.</p>
<p>Allegedly the ex-Raiders wide receiver was driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. He reportedly had a 0.16% blood-alcohol level which was twice what the legal limit in Nevada was. In the crash that was caused by Ruggs, a 23-year-old woman named Tina Tintor was killed. The ex-pro athlete’s Chevrolet Corvette rear-ended Tintor’s car which resulted in her death as well as the death of Max, the woman’s pet dog. At the crash site, Ruggs refused to take a sobriety test.</p>
<p>Now, a few years after the tragic incident, Ruggs spoke to a judge Tuesday confirming he will admit to drunk driving which caused the crash resulting in the death of the young woman, media reports revealed. Reportedly, the former professional athlete admitted he will enter a guilty plea in front of Justice of the Peace Harmony Letizia.</p>
<p>Sentencing is Scheduled for Next Week</p>
<p>Initial charges against Ruggs included DUI which resulted in fatal injury as well as reckless driving. He was also up for a misdemeanor gun-related charge because police uncovered a loaded handgun in the crashed car of the former athlete. Those charges may have resulted in a sentence of more than 50 years in prison. However, under the guilty plea that Ruggs may engage in, his sentence may be set between three to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>After the crash that resulted in the death of Ms Tintor, Ruggs was treated for a leg injury while his girlfriend who was in the passenger seat, Kiara Je’nai Kilgo-Washington, was treated for an injury to her arm. Although prosecutors proposed a $1 million bail for the former athlete, his bail was set at $150,000. The sentencing of the ex-Raiders wide receiver is planned for May 10, 2023.</p>
