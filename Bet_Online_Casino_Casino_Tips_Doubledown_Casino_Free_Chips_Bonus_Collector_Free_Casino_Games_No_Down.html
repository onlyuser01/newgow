<p>Sixth Year of Gary Russell’s Reign</p>
<p>Now a 33-year-old, Russell Jr. started his boxing journey in his teens, achieving considerable success as an amateur pugilist. The best example is the bronze medal at the 2005 World Championship.</p>
<p>Russell Jr. turned pro in 2009, defeating Antonio Reyes in his first professional bout. From there, he went on to win the next 23 fights before finally being stopped by Vasiliy Lomachenko by majority decision in June 2014.</p>
<p>He rebounded a few months later with a win over Christopher Martin Peña. Then, he got a title shot against Jhonny González, which Russell Jr. won, getting ahold of the WBC featherweight title.</p>
<p>He won the championship belt in March 2015 and since, no one was able to take it from him. Five boxers tried but failed each time. Are we going to see Russell Jr. keep his title for another year?</p>
<p>Undefeated Magsayo having Big Dreams</p>
<p>The Filipino pugilist is the current holder of the WBO International featherweight title, which he won in August 2021 by beating Julio Ceja by knockout. The win over Ceja was Magsayo’s 23rd win of his career, as well as his 16th KO win.</p>
<p>Ceja was the most high-profile boxer Magsayo’s fought so far. Before losing the fight, the Mexican was 32-4. He did, however, lose two of the three earlier fights. That fact has made people doubt Magsayo’s ability against in-form boxers.</p>
<p>The undefeated Filipino has a chance to prove his detractors wrong. For that, he needs to beat Russell Jr. on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>Pick: Magsayo by KO</p>
