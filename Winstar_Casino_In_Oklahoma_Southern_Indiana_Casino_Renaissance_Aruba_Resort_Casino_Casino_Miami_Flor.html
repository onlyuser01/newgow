<p>The fast-growing business-to-business (B2B) content and aggregation platform, REEVO, forged a new partnership with the leading iGaming content provider, SYNOT Games, a statement reveals. Announced last week, the latest collaboration seeks to further expand REEVO's wide range of offerings by bringing in engaging games from the aforementioned provider to its growing portfolio of partners and their players.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted content agreement, SYNOT Games will provide its exceptional games for REEVO. The iGaming provider's thrilling content will be integrated into REEVO's continuously-growing platform, allowing it to reach new audiences and partners. Thanks to the new deal, REEVO's partners and their clients will be able to access fan-favorite games like the Book of Secrets 6 Dice, Respin Joker Dice, as well as Firebird Double 27 Dice, among others. Overall, SYNOT Games offers more than 120 thrilling and engaging games that bring unique features. The company's content is available in 32 different languages.</p>
<p>The collaboration with SYNOT Games comes on the heels of another important deal announced by REEVO. Earlier this month, the company joined forces with the leading iGaming content developer, Barbara Bang. Under the terms of that deal, REEVO expanded its aggregation platform once again, bringing thrilling games that stand out with unique features, mechanics and themes.</p>
<p>The deal with SYNOT Games further expands REEVO's aggregation platform. The company currently offers more than 8,000 games from more than 70 leading iGaming content providers. As a result, the aggregation platform delivers a wide range of table, crash and slot games. Additionally, REEVO's platform offers unique live gaming experiences via live dealer games, among other exclusive titles.</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO's Head of Sales, shared her excitement about the latest deal saying: "Partnering with SYNOT Games marks another leap forward for REEVO, and weâ€™re genuinely excited about the possibilities it opens up." She outlined that an ongoing goal for the company is to bring elevated experiences to its growing customer base.</p>
<p>Poola added: "Collaborating with SYNOT Games, who shares our passion for delivering engaging gaming content, allows us to achieve this goal more effectively." Finally, REEVO's Head of Sales said: "This partnership will enable us to offer an even wider array of high-quality games through our leading aggregation platform, bringing added value to our operator partners and a new level of entertainment to players."</p>
