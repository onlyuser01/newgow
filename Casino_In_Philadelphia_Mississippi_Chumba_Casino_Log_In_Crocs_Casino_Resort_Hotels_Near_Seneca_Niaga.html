<p>Responsible gambling charity BetBlocker has announced that it is further expanding its coverage and will now be available to Spanish-speaking customers through a partnership with Coolbet, an established and trusted online casino brand and operator.</p>
<p>BetBlocker is a powerful app that is designed to enable consumers to restrict access to gambling websites from various devices, with the app presently having a library of more than 85,000 gambling websites. Commenting on this new milestone negotiated with Coolbet, and his company’s efforts to create a robust and consumer-focused product, founder Duncan Garvie had this to say:</p>
<p>"Blocking software offers a great tool to both restrict the access of those in crisis and support those looking to maintain control. And because so much of the funding for responsible gambling charities is derived in English-speaking markets it is very easy to take an Anglocentric worldview. It is easy to be complacent and view it as ‘job done’ if you provide the service in English."</p>
<p>As Garvie noted, the app was trying to break away from the idea that only English speakers were impacted by gambling, and BetBlocker is a tool that transcends national and language borders to deliver its solutions where players need them the most. Garvie also praised Coolbet’s efforts to make this a possibility and ensure that players in Spanish-speaking regions have access to an advanced tool that is designed to positively impact a large number of lives.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Coolbet President Endre Nesset welcomed the chance to be collaborating with BetBlocker as well. "Coolbet is a brand built on fairness and transparency. We believe that the entertainment and thrill that comes with gambling must go hand in hand with responsibility," Nesset added. He said that the app will prove an important ally in making sure that consumers are protected.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Coolbet has been also building up its presence in different markets and adding to its extensive portfolio of games. The operator teamed up with Stakelogic recently to enhance its live casino portfolio. To strengthen its presence in key markets, including Latin America, the operator also announced that it is going to work with Enteractive to benefit from its user base of dormant accounts and reactivate them.</p>
<p>Any returning player will now have the opportunity to benefit from BetBlocker’s value-added responsible gambling tool that is always looking for the player first. Casino Guru has also embarked on a similar responsible gambling initiative captured by the Gamtegrity platform, which includes the Global Self-Exclusion System (GSES).</p>
