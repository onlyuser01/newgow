<p>Max Verstappen Going for Another F1 Win</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is favored to win the Qatar Grand Prix sprint shootout. We believe he will pull it off, thus securing the Formula 1 title for the 2023 season. This, however, doesn’t mean he’ll give up on the actual race. On the contrary, you can be 100% certain that he wants to win the Qatar GP on Sunday.</p>
<p>The reason? This is one of only three races on the Formula 1 calendar that he still hasn’t won. There’s a simple explanation as to why that is the case, though. This event was held only once so far. It happened two years ago when we saw Lewis Hamilton triumph. Verstappen finished second in that race, but he did record the fastest lap.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2023, and Verstappen seems much, much better than Hamilton and all the other drivers in Formula 1. He also has the best car, as well as the best team of mechanics to support him.</p>
<p>Sergio Perez Eying a Podium Finish</p>
<p>Max Verstappen’s Red Bull Racing teammate is second in the Formula 1 Drivers’ Championship standings with 177 points fewer than the Dutchman. The chance of him getting to the top is almost nonexistent. In fact, his goal for the 2023 season is to finish second.</p>
<p>He’s 33 points ahead of Lewis Hamilton in the standings, and with six races left on the 2023 F1 calendar, his spot isn’t safe yet. He had a chance to increase the lead over Hamilton in Japan, but due to a crash, he had to retire from the race.</p>
<p>Now, he’s hoping to win some points, finishing on the podium in the best-case scenario. He does have what it takes to win this race, but only if his teammate Verstappen lets him. That might happen if the Dutchman wins the F1 title on Saturday.</p>
<p>2023 Qatar Grand Prix Prediction</p>
<p>Our Qatar GP prediction is that one of the Red Bull Racing drivers will win Sunday’s race. Verstappen is the favorite for a reason, but we wouldn’t be too shocked if +1100 Perez upsets the odds.</p>
<p>Pick: Max Verstappen to win; Perez to finish on the podium</p>
