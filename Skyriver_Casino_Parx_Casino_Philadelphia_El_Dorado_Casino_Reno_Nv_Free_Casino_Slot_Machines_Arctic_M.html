    <h1>Skyriver Casino Parx Casino Philadelphia El Dorado Casino Reno Nv Free Casino Slot Machines Arctic M</h1>

<p>Thank you for your response and explanation, Casino Midas Team.</p>
<p>Dear Tato1111,</p>
<p>After a throughout discussion and consideration of all the facts, we have come to the following conclusion:</p>
<p>As was already previously mentioned. We can agree with you that the casino could have closed your account far sooner, but on the other hand, it is nothing unusual that the casinos are trying to retain their customers, so unless there is no gambling problem clearly stated, the casino doesn't have to close your account immediately.</p>
<p>As the Casino Midas Team stated, you have requested to close your account only after you were not provided with any further bonuses from the Casino team. No clear request for self-exclusion or clear information that you have gambling problems has been submitted by you in your emails to the casino.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings xxx Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information we are forced to reject this complaint.</p>
<p>We are sorry We could not be of more help on this occasion. If you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
<p>Casino Guru</p>
