<p>Hi petronela. Good morning I appreciate you reply. Yes as I said if the time is 10 to 11. The credit of your deposit will arrive around 2 to 3 am...how can you play that? The player will complain to the libe chat they will always say that the bank is having update? What update everynight update? Its happen to me 4times already. I finish my work around 10:30pm and I want to relax deposit a little amount to spin a little but I fall to sleep of waiting. Who's player will wait 5hours waiting before he can play ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ that's why last night after work I want to play. But I remember my horror experience. So I chat to the liberal chat and they said the bank is having update again jesus!!!! I cancel my deposit and play AK47.bets casino. Upon deposit credits arrive...no drama. No waiting. Although the game is limited but in terms deposit and smooth playing in late night...I think AK47.bets deserve the 20star....happy luke casino only happy during day time on the night time 10pm to 2am....its not happy anymore. Its waiting time casino</p>
