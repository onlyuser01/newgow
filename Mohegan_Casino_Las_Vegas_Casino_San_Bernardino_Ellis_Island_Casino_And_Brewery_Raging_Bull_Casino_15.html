<p>Hard Rock venues in Florida reopen tomorrow. The venues will follow strict social distancing protocols and enhanced sanitation procedures.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Properties in Florida Reopen Tomorrow</p>
<p>Florida’s casinos reopen as of tomorrow, June 12. The casinos in the state were closed back in mid-March. The prime reason for the closure was the growing COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to flatten the curve and help the state fight with the spread of the coronavirus, all casino operations were suspended. Now, after nearly three months, the casinos in the Sunshine State can finally restart business. Resuming business, all operators will have to follow strict social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols.</p>
<p>Hard Rock has announced that the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood, the Seminole Casino Coconut Creek and the Seminole Classic Casino in Hollywood will all reopen at noon on Friday, June 12. The resuming of operations marks the return of some 3,200 employees back to work. Besides the casinos, some of the restaurants will also reopen doors, following guidelines for social distancing. The Seminole Hard Rock in Tampa already resumed operations back in May, while the Seminole Brighton Casino in Okeechobee will reopen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Further to the announcement by Hard Rock, the premises of Hard Rock Live at Seminole Hard Rock and The Pavilion at Seminole Casino Coconut Creek will stay closed for the moment. The Seminole Casino Immokalee is also expected to announce a reopening date soon.</p>
<p>The Post COVID-19 Casino Atmosphere at Hard Rock’s Venues</p>
<p>Commenting on the subject, Jim Allen, CEO of Seminole Gaming and Chairman of Hard Rock International said: “Hard Rock and Seminole Gaming have made a tremendous commitment to sanitary protocols and a safety-first mentality for both guests and team members.” He continued by saying: “We are making sure our resorts and casinos are safe and sound so our guests and team members have peace of mind when they return.“</p>
<p>But what are the safety measures which can be expected at the venues? For starters, the casinos will operate at 50% reduced capacity. All guests and employees will undergo temperature checks prior to entering the premises. Following CDC guidelines, all visitors or employees with a temperature above 100.4 degrees will not be allowed to enter. All visitors will have to wear masks. If a visitor doesn’t have one, the venue will be able to provide it. Social distancing will be ensured by turning off slots machines.</p>
<p>Enhanced sanitation protocols will be followed which will include disinfecting of high traffic areas and touchable surfaces. Hand-sanitizers will be allocated in stations near the casino entrance and around the venues. Signs will be encouraging the guests to keep social distance. Poker tables, game tables and service related areas will all have plexiglas separators. Last but not least, air purification will be conducted constantly. According to Hard Rock, this will be done with the help of a AtmosAir bipolar ionization system which kills virus bacteria in the air.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Florida, Disney prepares to reopen the Walt Disney World resort. The company plans to reopen doors for visitors as of next month. Similar to Hard Rock, Disney will also take extra care when it comes to sanitization and social distancing. Limited visitors will be allowed in restaurants and gyms. The company also noted that contactless options for payment are going to be encouraged.</p>
