<p>Hi so they have approved my kyc document I won around 3000 dollars and there withdrawal process is very strict my first withdrawal I asked for a bankwire of $500 as I had read you can do this in there terms and conditions however I am unsure if I misread it as they sent me a cheque of $325 roughly id need to check exact figure I explained to them my 2 bank accounts do not accept international cheques most places don’t and for me to send the cheque back they told me it would cost $250 to void it , they then sent me a money gram payment as they advised this method at first I agreed however I then asked not to recieve payment this way however they sent it anyway and due to covid -19 I cannot collect it as the journey is an hour away to collect and I do not drive therefore if need to make an un necessary journey, they then agreed to fortnightly bank wire of $750 which I thought would be fine as it was processed and approved however I didn’t recieve the money so I submitted a query to ask for a tracking. Number incase my bank had made an error - no response, I asked how to complain to higher management - no response, I asked who I can complain to as in there license holder - no response. They then returned the 1st withdrawal back to bingo account and I haven’t recieved the 2nd into my bank, but they just keep advising me to withdraw again but I do not see the purpose in applying for it not to arrive they have gave no reason to what has went wrong. Today is withdrawal day and I have another bank account I use so I have emailed to ask if they want to try send it to that account this time I am awaiting a reply.</p>
<p>i have made many queries to the site about this and I have all the emails going back and forth if you read mine I ask questions, they do not get answered directly for some reason. Starting to worry I have been scammed!! Hope you can help me recover something back don’t know what else to do !</p>
