    <h1>Vegas X Online Casino Coconut Creek Seminole Casino Buffalo Run Casino Resort Juegos De Casinos Grat</h1>

<p>I have not received my winnings from this casino because it seems they have processed my withdrawal to the wrong crypto address. They somehow mistakenly sent the funds to my depositing address instead, that is the address where I originally sent my deposit to play at the casino. It's worth mentioning that I have successfully received payment into the same crypto wallet from several other casinos without any issues, but only Stellar Spins have managed to make this odd mistake. I've emailed them and provided screenshots that proves it is an error on their behalf but the casino have denied all accountability and insists that they have sent the funds to the correct address. I'm not sure what else to do apart from enlisting your help in hope to resolve this matter. Please see below for a timeline of this event and sorry for the lengthy explanation but the whole thing is rather bizarre and quite confusing, so please bear with me. Much thanks.</p>
<p>On July 3, 2022, I made a deposit of $45.96 AUD to Stellar Spins Casino using bitcoin as the payment method. I won $600 AUD and submitted a withdrawal request for that amount. At the time, I noticed that their withdrawal page was missing a crypto address field. Other casinos would have a space or box where you can put in your receiving crypto address, this ensures funds will be sent to the correct address. However this option was missing from their withdrawal page, which I thought was strange. I emailed them to raise this concern and in the email I clearly stated my receiving btc wallet address and instructed them to send the funds to that address.</p>

<p>On July 5, I received an email from the casino requesting proof of my crypto address. I sent them a screenshot from my Exodus wallet showing my receiving btc address which begins with "bc1", as well as a screenshot of a transaction record showing the btc address beginning with "3M", where my deposit of $45.96 AUD was sent on July 3.</p>
<p>(see attachments - Email_2_220705)</p>
<p>On July 12, I received an email advising that my withdrawal request of $600 AUD have been processed and funds had been sent to my receiving address. However I did not receive any funds and upon checking the crypto address stated in their email, I realized they made an error. The address mentioned in their email was NOT my receiving btc wallet address but it was actually that depositing address beginning with "3M". For me it's easy to distinguish the difference between the two addresses because I know that my receiving btc address from my Exodus wallet always begins with "bc1". I'm not sure how this mix up could have possibly occurred for them, but when I contacted support via live chat the representative was confident that they have sent the funds to the correct address. It is extremely frustrating because I have proof that they have gotten the addresses mixed up.</p>
<p>And something else that seems questionable is, I have noticed some inconsistencies to my account before and after I submitted my withdrawal request. For example, I suddenly can no longer make crypto deposits, this option is all of a sudden not available on my deposit page anymore. The only deposit method available now is credit card, NeoSurf or Eezee Wallet. However after a bit of digging, I discovered that crypto deposit options are still available for other players, and it's only my account that seems to have been blocked from using this payment method. It seems rather dubious, but of course without proof I can't determine exactly the reason behind this, but I can only suggest that the casino is possibly attempting to hide their error by preventing me from retrieving my btc depositing address on the deposit page which would then match that address they claim they have sent the funds to, and therefore proof of their error.</p>
<p>(see attachments - Screenshot 1_Deposit Page BEFORE &amp; AFTER)</p>
<p>And finally it's probably worth mentioning that their withdrawal page have since been updated with an additional box to put in your crypto wallet details which did not exist at the time I made my withdrawal request.</p>

<p>I hope I have provided sufficient evidence to support my case, if you require anything further please let me know. I have made several deposits into this casino and finally got a nice win, but this withdrawal process has been extremely frustrating, exhausting and disheartening and I'm starting to doubt whether I would ever receive my winnings, if you could help in any way, it would be so much appreciated. Thank you.</p>
