    <h1>Sugarhouse Casino 4 Fun Aria Hotel Casino Agua Caliente Casino Hotel Casino Naples Fl Century Casino</h1>

<p>I was playing poker on Party Poker and decided to play some slots in their casino (Party Casino).</p>
<p>I was playing at 40p stake on Dragons Fire and got a feature. After 5 spins in I was only on 4euros but as I had the poker balance showing on another window it shot up from $163 to $2002. The casino balance remained at 129 euros so I thought where has this come from. Low and behold in the feature I was awarded an extra 50 free spins so then I knew it was going to be a massive payout on the feature. 1/2 an hour later when the feature had finished it paid 1650euros which now matched the poker balance in dollars. It sort of took the fun element away a bit but was nice to watch and see it unfold. From then onwards every spin I had I knew if it was going to win. So basically every spin is predetermined and the bells and whistles are just for show. Could this apply to online poker so that it be rigged in some way. I know there are more variables in poker but the cards being dealt out could easily be fixed in this way. If somehow people had access to this information they would know all the cards coming out and play the hand accordingly make all the right decisions 100% of the time. It would certainly explain some very strange play. Anyway I digressed away from the slot story</p>
