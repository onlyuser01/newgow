<p>Los Angeles Galaxy Has High Ambitions for the 2022 Season</p>
<p>Led by Greg Vanney, the coach who led Toronto FC to the 2017 MLS Cup, Los Angeles Galaxy has big plans for the upcoming season. These guys are expected to play offensive-minded soccer from the very start, given that their strongest weapon is their attack.</p>
<p>Chicharito, the man who scored 17 goals last season is their crucial player in 2022. Now a 33-year-old, the Mexican striker used to play for Manchester United in the past. He’s not getting any younger, but this season, he’s going to have several youngsters to help him out in the offense.</p>
<p>One of those is Serbian forward Dejan Joveljic, who joined Galaxy from Wolfsberger AC, a team competing in the Austrian Bundesliga. Last year, he scored 18 goals in the Austrian top-flight, which made him the second-highest scorer in the league.</p>
<p>The bad news for Galaxy is that New York City has at least equally good strikers on its roster.</p>
<p>New York City Wants to Keep Hold of the MLS Cup</p>
<p>It’s never easy to retain the MLS title for two straight seasons. In fact, the last time we saw a team win back-to-back MLS seasons was in 2012 when Los Angeles Galaxy did it.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be easy, but New York City players are determined to pull it off. What gives them confidence is that most of their key men from the last season are still in the club. One notable exception is Ismael Tajouri, a Libyan midfielder who scored seven goals for New York City in its title-winning season. Starting in 2022, he’s playing for Galaxy.</p>
<p>On the bright side, New York’s best attacker, Valentin Castellanos is still on the roster. The man who scored 22 goals in the MLS last season, as well as made 8 assists, is expected to lead NY’s offense on Saturday.</p>
<p>With so much offensive power on both ends, it’s very likely we will witness a lot of goals in the Galaxy vs NY City game. But who will win? Probably no one – a draw seems like the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>Picks: Draw; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
