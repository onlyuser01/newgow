    <h1>South Point Casino Movies Rio All Suites Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Nv Nooksack Northwood Casino Imm</h1>

<p>Dear dario9d,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the casino T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>10.Betting Limitations:unless otherwise stated on the main Bonus page, all Bonuses are subject to a maximum betting limitation in relation to the deposit amount. Failure to comply with this "maximum bet rule" may result in account closure, Bonus removal and any winnings obtained during Bonus wagering. Any bets using deposited or bonus funds prior to completing the Bonus are subject to the following limits:</p>
<p>Maximum risk per bet in Casino - 20% of the deposited amount</p>
<p>Our position is closely explained in Fair Gambling Codex. The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you have been accused mistakenly and that you have not breached the maximum bet rule, feel free to forward me your game history together with a link to the specific bonus that you redeemed and played. My email address is veronika.l@casino.guru.</p>
<p>If there is any other relevant communication between you and the casino, please send it as well.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
