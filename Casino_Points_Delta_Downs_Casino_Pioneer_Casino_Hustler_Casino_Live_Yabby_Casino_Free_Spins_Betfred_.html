<p>Betfred, a prominent British sports betting operator, has announced the official date for the opening of its Mohegan Sun Sportsbook in Nevada. The news was shared via email press release with the Mohegan Sun Sportsbook coming online on Thursday, February 9, hosted in the Virgin HotelsLas Vegas.</p>
<p>The sportsbook already has the necessary approvals from the Silver State regulators, to name the Nevada Gaming Commission and the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which okayed Betfred as the operator for the upcoming sportsbook last month.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity in the US and North American market, Betfred Founder and Chairman, Fred Done, said that he was excited to have completed the long, but important regulatory process in Nevada. The facility means a lot for the Betfred team as it’s the company’s entry into Nevada, the "sports betting capital of the world," as Done put it.</p>
<p>JC Hospitality CEO and President Richard Bosworth, whose company owns the Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, was equally pleased with the development and hailed the opportunity to see the Mohegan Sun Sportsbook launch together with Betfred on the company’s properties.</p>
<p>The opening will be attended by Cincinnati Bengals legend Elbert "Ickey" Woods who will place the first wager at the newly-minted sportsbook at the venue at 3:00 pm local time. The choice of first punter is not random either, as Betfred is the Official Sports Betting Partner for the Bengals.</p>
<p>Mohegan Casino Las Vegas General Manager Joe Hasson was similarly pleased to welcome this new launch, adding that the entire team at Mohegan welcomed the arrival of this new project. Betfred has been similarly looking to expand in the United States, anticipating the importance of the market which was at the time only one year into regulation.</p>
<p>Betfred USA Sports was founded in 2019 in an attempt for the entertainment giant to establish a firmer foothold in the fast-evolving market. The original group was founded in 1967 by brothers Fred and Peter Done and it operates out of the United Kingdom where the company owns more than 1,400 betting shops.</p>
<p>Betfred has also been expanding its reach and presence in the market in the United States through a partnership with another Nevada-based sports franchise, the NHL team Vegas Golden Knights. The Thursday launch is the latest successful effort by the company to increase its presence while adding value for sports fans, bettors, and sports at the same time.</p>
