    <h1>Desert Diamond Casino Glendale Arizona Arizona Charlie S Casino In Las Vegas Altoona Iowa Casino Bes</h1>

<p>Ruined what was a good experience.</p>
<p>Well I would have probably given a good review, a month ago. However, not so much anymore. Everything started out good I would have even recommend them as a top casino however due to incidents the past 2 weeks I will not be.</p>
<p>I had several withdrawals pending, via wire transfer, how ever my fault I miss typed the transit number while entering the wire transfer info. I had tried to communicate that with customer service and just kept getting put off. Told the money will be deposited into my account anyways, every customer service member i talk to seem to just not care and would respond back with oh wait a few days. It will show up, when I told them it won’t they seemed to all ignore me. I had talked to 3 people over live chat 1 over email. And no one seemed to care. By the final person I chatted with over live chat I was quite upset and a little stressed out. As there was a unforeseen financial emergency. My pet got sick and my rent was due. My whole pay check needed to go to these events leaving me no money for my basic needs. So it turned out these winnings were going to come in handy to help me out. However anytime i asked about it I just got told to wait a few more days. Yes I’ll admit I was probably in the wrong a bit by letting my frustration and stress do the talking. However after it had been a week and my first withdrawal wasn’t in yet I was starting to get a bit upset. Meanwhile the 3rd guy I had talked to, kept just egging me on, telling me I don’t know how withdrawals work, and that he needs to re educate me on them. And but would be no help to me, or give me answers.</p>
<p>Without thinking to much, I made a few comments like:</p>
<p>"I needed that money for food".</p>
<p>"Guess ill just starve at this rate"</p>
<p>"It's not like your going to make my funds appear so I can finally eat after 3 days"</p>
<p>Which they took as I have a "Gambling" issue, because for once I actually needed my winnings. Any other time I could not have cared less how long they took. Well it was not because of "gambling" issue, but unforseen circumstances in my day to day life. They decided to lock my account then close it permanently. And tell me I need to look into help. The reason they closed my account was due to those comments.</p>
<p>I was emailed by their customer support supervisor. Telling me she did closed it due to those issues and sent my withdrawal through again. When I tried to explain the situation and the circumstances as to I was a bit stressed out at the time. And closing my account was totally uncalled for. She ignored my final email, and I got no response. She did not care, and just decided that was the way to go. If your pet/kid was sick and you were a little tight on money would you not be a little stressed also?</p>
<p>I still have not seen my withdrawal from almost 2 weeks ago, and the other few I was told were deposited successfully, I have sent screen shots of my accounts and no withdrawals on my statement, just to be told AGAIN wait a few days.</p>
<p>Every aspect of dealing with customer service was unprofessional, from staff on live chat to customer service supervisors. And a big waste of time. I would not be this upset and writing this review if she did not close my account permanently. As this was my main casino, and my favourite up until this recent incident. It’s really disappointing that this is how they treat their customers. And just shows that they do not care about customers. It’s rather sad to see what was a good site go and pull something like this.</p>
