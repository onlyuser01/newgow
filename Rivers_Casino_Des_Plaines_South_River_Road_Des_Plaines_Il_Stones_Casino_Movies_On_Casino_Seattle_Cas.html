    <h1>Rivers Casino Des Plaines South River Road Des Plaines Il Stones Casino Movies On Casino Seattle Cas</h1>

<p>Online sports betting and iGaming platform provider Soft2Bet announced that a Swedish player had won one of the largest jackpots at YoYo Casino, one of the operator’s online brands. Soft2Bet released a special video on their official YouTube channel, congratulating the lucky individual who will walk away with 229,072.90 SEK, equating to roughly €214.000.</p>
<p>The Lucky Player Won the Second Largest Jackpot</p>
<p>The company intentionally avoided releasing detailed information about the jackpot winner to protect their privacy. The lucky player struck the Major jackpot while playing Book of Atem Wowpot, an Egyptian-themed slot title created by Estonian iGaming developer All41 Studios. The game has a progressive jackpot mechanic and a maximum bet multiplier of x5000. The Swedish client won the title’s second-largest prize- the Major jackpot.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet head of country managers Peter Christian Noer lauded the Wowpot title for helping increase player engagement at YoYo Casino. He also remarked that seeing players win big was always a welcome occasion.</p>
<p>“This kind of win is what all players dream of – hitting the big jackpot. We are super happy that one of our players got to experience this… and we always hope to see more players collect big wins .” Peter Christian Noer, Soft2Bet head of country managers</p>
<p>Soft2Bet’s Brands Enjoy Significant Success in Sweden</p>
<p>Soft2Bet was founded in the summer of 2018 with a team of only 70 people but experienced substantial growth as it obtained several B2C and B2B European licenses. The company currently has over 1,000 employees in offices across Cyprus, Malta, and Bulgaria. It entered the Swedish iGaming and sports betting market in April 2020 with the online casino site YoYoCasino, shortly followed by sports betting brand Campobet.</p>
<p>After its initial success, the operator added a third brand to its Swedish portfolio with Betinia.se. The new Soft2Bet sportsbook had a novel approach focused on increasing brand loyalty. It utilizes gamification elements to elicit a stronger emotional bond with players and increase their connection to the product.</p>
<p>The Company Is Enjoying Substantial Momentum</p>
<p>Outside of Sweden, Soft2Bet has a presence in a dozen other countries, primarily in Europe and Latin America. In January, the operator received a B2B license in Denmark, expanding its reach in the Nordics. The company will rely on its Swedish experience to better power Danish betting companies with its various games. Furthermore, Soft2Bet will be allowed to provide local operators with its proprietary sports betting platform.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet has been enjoying double-digit growth every quarter, using this success to fuel growth and expand its portfolio. The company recently partnered with online gaming creator Evoplay, significantly increasing its collection of quality titles. In return, the game developer received access to Soft2Bet’s impressive market reach. The two companies pledged to fully use the partnership to the fullest and retain their momentum into 2023.</p>
