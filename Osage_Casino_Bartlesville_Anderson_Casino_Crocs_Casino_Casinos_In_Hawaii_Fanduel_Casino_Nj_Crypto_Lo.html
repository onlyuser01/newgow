    <h1>Osage Casino Bartlesville Anderson Casino Crocs Casino Casinos In Hawaii Fanduel Casino Nj Crypto Lo</h1>

<p>Hello, my complaint is not necessarily about a delayed payment but about the shenanigans this casino clearly displays. To elaborate, I requested a Coindraw withdrawal on 12/23/2022, which after approximately 24 hours was kicked back and the amount placed in my available balance. When I inquired through chat support I was told that my withdrawal "timed out due to a system glitch, and I need to resubmit my request." OK fine. I resubmitted the withdrawal request and after about 24 hours the withdrawal was once again kicked back and the amount placed in my available balance. I went to chat support and was informed without any explanation as to why my w/d was canceled that I exhausted my Coindraw withdrawal attempts and need to select another method. I mean come on. I've been playing at online casinos for a very long time and this type of dodginess is a huge red flag. Not to mention, there are no other w/d methods listed, just Coindraw. The whole thing stinks of payout avoidance, and I firmly believe it is imperative that you investigate not only my withdrawal experience but the casino as a whole. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.</p>
<p>-Darren</p>
