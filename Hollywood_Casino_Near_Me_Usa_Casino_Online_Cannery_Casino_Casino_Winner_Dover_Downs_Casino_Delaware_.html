    <h1>Hollywood Casino Near Me Usa Casino Online Cannery Casino Casino Winner Dover Downs Casino Delaware</h1>

<p>Thank you for your reply and the data provided, Nick. Please, look at my last messages and questions on Skype. In the meantime, I will also update the disputed amount to â‚®/$25.</p>
<p>Dear Nelimal,</p>
<p>I think you started mixing 2 different issues here. As for the "LOKOLIFE" bonus, as you call it, I see it was claimed and used after the main issue of this complaint (the original disputed amount of $60, while $34 has been already paid out) was resolved. Or, was there any "LOKOLIFE" bonus used before the main issue occurred?</p>
<p>Although I requested a few more details from Nick, I would like to explain the situation as it looks according to the provided data and details, which confirms Nick's claims above.</p>
<p>You mentioned winnings of $15 first, and that then you made a deposit of $30 (I see $31 there). But, the mentioned $15 were not winnings, those were just free funds for only tournament play purposes, so it seems like they were not withdrawable funds yet. Since there was no other activity, and you decided to withdraw all funds without playing, you were informed that it is necessary to wager your deposit at least 1x - maybe this information was incorrectly interpreted by customer service, or it was not explained to you correctly, because a deposit on top of free funds caused the "mixing funds". Then, I see again a withdrawal request of a $45 - $30 real money deposit that was not played and $15 free funds that were not withdrawable. When you had $60 in your balance and requested a new withdrawal, the casino found out the funds were mixed, while logically - if you had $60, should have wagered your $31 deposit at least 1x, and you still had free funds of $15 in your balance, it is very likely your deposit had not been wagered yet. Even if the obligatory wagering was made, it would have not been possible to withdraw anything because the funds were mixed. At this point, the casino "reset" your balance, removed the free funds for tournaments of $15 and left only your deposit of $31 there. This was the time you were asked to wager your deposit at least 1x again to be able to make a withdrawal.</p>
<p>You requested several withdrawals while you bet only $1.1 from your deposit after the "reset". Then, I see that you played with your deposit and managed to collect something around $50 in your balance when you requested a withdrawal of $35 ($34 that was successfully processed and $1 as a fee that was deducted from the payment). After this Coindraw withdrawal of $34 was processed, I see you claimed the mentioned "LOKOLIFE" bonus (18 Free Spins) - at that moment, your balance was $0, so it looks like the remaining balance of around $15 was lost by playing prior to these Free Spins activation.</p>
<p>To be honest, since we are talking about the "mixing funds", I cannot see anything unusual in your transaction history, but I was not provided with your gameplay history, therefore, I asked Nick for some additional details.</p>
<p>Is my explanation enough for your, or is there anything else I could help you with? Is there anything in my explanation that could be incorrect, or do you feel that it happened in another way? Feel free to correct me.</p>
