    <h1>Cherokee Casinos Payday Casino Dayton Casino Lady Luck Casino Online Hotel Casino Monte Carlo Las Ve</h1>

<p>I hope it wasn't an exception &amp; they might start paying people now!</p>
<p>I have a hard time believing this, but miracles happen every day ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Let's hope that we've come to our senses.</p>
<p>Even the nasty thing they did here could be forgiven if they started to sincerely apologize!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if that sounds childish, it really hurts me when I see operators like this ripping off their customers.</p>
<p>Nobody deserves to be pissed off like that.</p>
<p>I hope that one day we will live in a system that just doesn't allow that anymore.</p>
<p>A lot of things in this industry are geared so that there is almost nothing you can do when push comes to shove.</p>
<p>And if you do then you need a damn good lawyer who will probably cost more than the profits.</p>
<p>I just hate it.</p>
<p>Especially when I read things like "I won really well and bought things before that because I counted on the money &amp; now have no money for food".</p>
<p>Of course you should always wait until the profits are there before you spend your money, but I think it's normal that you're happy and want to buy something because you think money will come...</p>
<p>They don't just steal people's money, they steal their trust.</p>
<p>They really break things...</p>
<p>And that the paper is made from the paper for a piece of tree &amp; then money ^^ so a piece of tree ðŸŒ³ for that you fool your customers who make you what they actually are.</p>
<p>I don't like this world. ðŸ™‚</p>
