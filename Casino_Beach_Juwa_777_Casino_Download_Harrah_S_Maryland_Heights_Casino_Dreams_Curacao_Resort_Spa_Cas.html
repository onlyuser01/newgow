<p>Two fallen Premier League giants are locking horns on Saturday – Liverpool vs Chelsea. Let’s see who will do better at Anfield</p>
<p>Exactly one year ago, Liverpool and Chelsea were in the Top 3 in the Premier League. Ahead of their duel on Saturday, January 21, the two are occupying the #9 and #10 position, respectively.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that neither team can be proud of their recent performances, but the fact is that both teams do have the manpower necessary to bounce back. And we’re certain both will return to the winning track very soon; but which team will do it first?</p>

<p>Moneyline Odds Liverpool -118 Draw +275 Chelsea +320</p>

<p>Liverpool Need to Patch the Holes in their Defense</p>
<p>The Red have played two Premier League games so far in 2023, and they lost each time. First, the Brentford Bees strung them 3-1 in London; then, the Seagulls pecked them apart 3-0 in Brighton.</p>

<p>Conceding three goals per game isn’t something Liverpool’s defense got us used to. However, there’s an explanation for that. The Reds’ best defender – Virgil van Dijk – is out with an injury.</p>
<p>The situation is even worse when it comes to Liverpool’s offense, with (at least) four strikers currently on the injury list. Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota are definitely out of the protocol, while Darwin Nunez and Roberto Firmino are doubtful for Saturday’s game.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even without those four, Jurgen Klopp does have a number of fantastic forwards at his disposal – Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo, etc. – they just need to start playing better soccer ASAP.</p>
<p>Chelsea’s Offense Needs to Start Scoring More</p>
<p>Chelsea’s fans are once again talking about the “No. 9 curse.” The player wearing that shirt – Aubameyang Pierre-Emerick – has been in dreadful form this season. He’s played 10 Premier League games in the Chelsea jersey, scoring only one goal along the way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his colleagues from the attacking department haven’t been much better either. Plus, many of them have suffered injuries that will keep them off the pitch in Saturday’s game – Christian Pulisic, Raheem Sterling, and Armando Broja.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it’s no surprise Chelsea owner decided to splash out a hefty sum to bring Joao Felix on a loan deal from Atletico Madrid. He was supposed to add more firepower to the Blues, but the 23-year-old Portuguese got a red card on his debut. As a result, he now won’t be available for the Liverpool vs Chelsea game.</p>

<p>They also signed Ukrainian rising star Mykhailo Mudryk, but he might not be ready to start on Saturday. So, who will play in Chelsea’s attack?</p>
<p>It’s almost 100% certain coach Graham Potter will move attacking midfielder Kai Havertz closer to the opposition goal. Chelsea’s scoring leader (five goals in the EPL) does know how to play in this position, although we can’t call him an expert striker.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>Liverpool’s defense has been horrendous in 2023, but luckily for them, so is Chelsea’s offense. That’s why the Reds don’t need to worry much about protecting their goal on Saturday.</p>
<p>The big question is whether their banged-up offense can find the net against the Blues. With the help of the fans at Anfield, we think they can.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
