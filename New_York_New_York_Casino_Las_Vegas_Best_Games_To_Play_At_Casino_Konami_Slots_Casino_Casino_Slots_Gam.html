<p>XB Net, a global betting premium supplier for horse and greyhound racing, has renewed its partnership with Entain, international gaming and sports betting operator.</p>
<p>Xb Net Continues Its Collaboration with Entain</p>
<p>XB Net, a global wagering solution and leading premium supplier of content for horse and greyhound racing in North America, has announced the renewal of its retail-and-online distribution agreement with Entain, a global sports wagering and gaming operator and joint owner of BetMGM in the US.</p>
<p>Senior Vice President of International at XB Net, Simon Fraser, stated that announcing the renewal of the partnership with Entain is a turning point for the company as the operator’s brands are very dependent on the international success of horse racing.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, XB Net will deliver its multi-faceted wagering services, data, and live pictures of over 60 tracks in North America. XB Net currently covers around 75% of the US racing, including some of the most prestigious races like the Pegasus World Cup. It also covers the final two legs of this summer’s Triple Crown, featuring the Preakness and Belmont Stakes and Breeders’ Cup World Championships at Del Mar on November 5 and 6, the season’s flagship finale.</p>
<p>Fraser said that the continuation of the partnership is a validation of the team’s work over the past 12 months. According to him, it will help return value to key stakeholders in the business.</p>
<p>XB Net Provides Reliable Coverage and Betting Opportunities</p>
<p>With the renewal of the partnership, XB Net will enable Entain to optimize its programming timetable on all of its brands, providing wagering opportunities to attract new customers and retain existing users. The supplier will deliver its reliable coverage of domestic and international races to Entain’s brands across all regulated global markets.</p>
<p>According to Fraser Entain’s support in bringing live North American racing to more customers has helped the supplier grow internationally. Entain’s strategy for global expansion coincides with XB Net’s vision and values.</p>
<p>Aiming to expand its footprint on a global scale, XB Net recently joined forces with LiveScore Bet, the sportsbook of LiveScore Group, following another deal weeks before that with Australian sports betting arena operator CrossBet.</p>
<p>XB Net stands out as one of the most trustworthy suppliers of live North American horse racing content. It offers betting data, live broadcast and video streaming on behalf of its partners, utilizing low-latency feeds from more than 2,500 meetings, broadcasting over 25,000 races annually.</p>
<p>Entain Group Trading Director Tom Ritzema stated that Entain has a commitment to customer service and innovation, aiming to deliver its users the most reliable sports coverage across all of its brands. XB Net’s betting tools, advanced data, and content on North American racing will boost player enjoyment over a summer full of racing events, starting this month with Preakness, the second leg in the Triple Crown.</p>
