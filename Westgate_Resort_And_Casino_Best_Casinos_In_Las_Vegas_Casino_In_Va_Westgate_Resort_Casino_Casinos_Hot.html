<p>Jungle Stripes Slot Review</p>
<p>Jungle Stripes is a 5×3 video slot released by Betsoft in June 2021. The provider that is popular for its state-of-the-art visual effects created with the help of 3D elements and cinematographic presentations however opted for a little more simplicity when designing the jungle-themed slot.</p>
<p>With an excellent 97.03% Return to Player rate, a maximum win capped at 500x, free spins, and a bonus round with a focus on expanding sticky wild respins, the game introduces players to a satisfying number of twists that make it a good alternative to Netent’s Starburst slot that it found its original inspiration in.</p>
<p>The tropical forest-themed game is played on five reels and it counts 10 pay lines that pay both ways. If you wish to learn all about the theme, graphic design, sound effects, animations, game features and special mechanics, and table payout, read our expert online slot review for Jungle Stripes.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Get Lost Through the Lavish Jungle</p>
<p>While displaying clear Starburst influences, Jungle Stripes’ main focus is represented by the expanding sticky wild respins feature that will not only carry players into a whole different realm thanks to the winning potential of the feature but will also add more excitement in terms of graphic design and overall visual effects.</p>
<p>The jungle setting looks more appealing compared to Netent’s iconic release. This is due to the Shere Khan expansion that appears to be injected with growth steroids and the special shading effects that the developer has used to beautifully highlight the artistic quality of all crayoned symbols. For example, the lotus flowers appear to be glowing nonstop and the shadowy tiger claws appear to have a more dangerous appearance. The fluorescent mushrooms seem to be growing from crystals while the rest of the symbols are all similarly detailed and they will immediately captivate the interest of new players who have never tried the slot before.</p>
<p>Jungle Stripes, therefore, features a warm overall feel thanks to the damp and vividly colored rainforest used as a backdrop. Players are invited to walk straight into the wilderness and wait for the tiger’s claws to trigger some mouth-watering wins. The same mesmerizing jungle is packed with wild animals and mysteries. Players need to discover them one after the other while keeping a close eye on the Jungle King making an apparition. His rumbling growl will instantly shake up the peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p>The glowing lotus flowers along with the fluorescent mushrooms seen growing from crystals nicely complement the theme while turning the land into a magical go-to destination where everyone can start exploring for large wins and fast-paced action.</p>
<p>Jungle Stripes: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game counts seven symbols without considering the wild and scatter symbols since they do not trigger extra payouts. The slot’s highest-paying symbol is represented by the glowing lotus flowers along with the fluorescent mushroom symbols growing in pink crystals. Matching three identical lotus flower symbols will reward players with a payout of 3.75. Landing across four of these symbols will pay out 15x the stake while matching five lotus flower symbols will trigger a payout of 37.5x.</p>
<p>On the other hand, landing three, four, or five mushroom symbols will bring players 2.25x, 7.5x, and 18.75x wins.</p>
<p>The highest-paying symbols are followed by the mid-paying symbols represented by the tiger claws and the ladybug on a leaf symbol with payouts of 1.05x, 3x, and 7.50x for landing three, four, and five matching symbols on the winning lines.</p>
<p>The As, Ks, and QAs are the lowest-paying symbols. They reward players with wins of 0.45x, 1,20x, and 1.25x for three, four, and five identical symbols.</p>
<p>The game pays both ways and all coinciding wins on different pay lines are added together. The highest win per line direction is the one that will be paid off.</p>
<p>While the symbols are somehow related to the general jungle theme, they do not go together very well, leaving the impression that the developer randomly chose the designs.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game’s background music is upbeat and carefully chosen in relation to the theme without sounding too obnoxious. It features a nice blend of melodic drums combined with specific sounds you would normally hear when exploring a jungle.</p>
<p>Players also get to enjoy the specially created animation sound effects occurring once a win is triggered. While these sounds are heard much louder compared to the regular background music, some players may also argue that the clinking sounds do not blend very well with the theme in itself.</p>
<p>Jungle Stripes Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is smooth thanks to the highly responsive and easily identifiable tabs and buttons controlling the Menu, Bets, Paytable, Rules, Options, Music, Autoplay mode, and more. The Spin, Skip, and Stop buttons allow players to easily manage the way the reels are spinning. The X/- (Decrease/Increase) buttons let players select the value of their bets. Each of these buttons also has a shortcut correspondent on the keyboard for simplified gameplay. Players can choose up to 100 automated spins. It is also possible to turn the sound effects and background music on and off for more focus.</p>
<p>Jungle Stripes: Jungle King Wilds &amp; Moonglow Free Spins</p>
<p>The game primarily counts two different bonus features, with the wilds engaging the features during the base game. The scatters engage the free spins bonus round.</p>
<p>Stacked Jungle King Wilds Bring Automatic Re-spins</p>
<p>Once the Jungle King tiger symbol is seen making an appearance on reels two, three, or four, it turns into a stacked wild taking over the entire surface of the reel. Stacked wild symbols bring players thrice as many win opportunities compared to classic wilds.</p>
<p>The wild will keep its position while the other reels will automatically begin to spin again, awarding players with a second opportunity to win without actually paying for a new stake. Since the game pays both ways, the win potential is even greater. Provided the wild lands on the third reel, it brings players wins in either direction. Landing another wild during the re-spins will cause both of the wilds to stay in place for a fresh re-spin. Players cannot get several wilds during a single spin.</p>
<p>The stacked wild symbol is relatively simple, it packs a punch in terms of value. It gives you extra opportunities to win at any point. You don’t have to wait until you get free spins to get a big win.</p>
<p>Moonglow Free Spins Feature</p>
<p>The glowing moon represents the scatter in the game that can only pop up in the middle reels. This means players cannot land more than three scatters during just one spin. Getting three scatters will reward players with ten free spins that cannot be triggered again since there are no moon symbols on the free spins reels.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Jungle Stripes is a 5×3 video slot game that pays both ways with a maximum win capped at 500x, or expanding sticky wild respins, and free spins. Players looking for a jungle-themed game with fast-paced action and gameplay can try out this popular Betsoft title released in June 2021.</p>
