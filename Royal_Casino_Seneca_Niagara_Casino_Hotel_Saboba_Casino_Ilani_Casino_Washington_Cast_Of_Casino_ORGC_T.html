    <h1>Royal Casino Seneca Niagara Casino Hotel Saboba Casino Ilani Casino Washington Cast Of Casino ORGC T</h1>

<p>ORGC is not obliged to go for a traditional riverboat casino but must first secure an approval</p>
<p>Osage River Gaming and Convention (ORGC) has joined forces with Bally’s Corporation for a new casino project at Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri’s premier lake resort destination. The former company is currently working hard on getting its Osage River casino project approved.</p>
<p>The involvement of Bally’s in the project was revealed in a letter from ORGC to the City of Lake Ozark a few days ago. The letter also outlines the gaming group’s planned location for the casino, noting that it would take roughly 20 acres of the 90-acre Eagles’ Landing Phase 4 property. ORGC’s letter also noted that the rest of the area would be redeveloped as a hotel with a convention center, restaurants and shops.</p>
<p>For reference, Eagles’ Landing is a Gary Prewitt-operated development zone on both sides of Highway 54, on the edge of Lake Ozark. Currently, one side of the Eagles’ Landing property sports a variety of shops. The other side, where the Phase 4 parcel is situated, is a quarrying operation.</p>
<p>ORGC Is Not Obliged to Do an Actual Riverboat Casino</p>
<p>In any case, ORGC is not obliged to go for a traditional riverboat casino. While Missouri law is centered on riverboat casinos, it also allows them to be built on the shore, as long as they fulfill a number of requirements. For reference, Missouri defines legal casinos as “excursion gambling boats.” However, the state interprets this term rather broadly and, in 2021, amended the definition to include “nonfloating facilities.”</p>
<p>Despite that, casino operators should still have a few rules in mind. As mentioned, excursion gambling boats can be on the shore, as long as they are within 1,000 feet of the Missouri or Mississippi River (the Eagles’ Landing Phase 4 is within 1,000 of the edge of the Osage River floodplain).</p>
<p>In addition, casino facilities must be licensed by the Missouri Gaming Commission. The state currently has only 13 licenses, all of which are handed out to various companies. Finally, gambling properties must have at least 2,000 gallons of water inside or underneath the facility in rigid or semi-rigid containers, tanks or structures.</p>
<p>However, ORGC would still have to secure an amendment that would allow it to build a property on the Osage River.</p>
