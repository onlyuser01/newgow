<p>Storm Lords Slot Review</p>
<p>Storm Lords is one of RTG’s most popular Asian-inspired video slots released in 2019. The game features an excellent design that carries players straight into the fascinating world of martial arts where they will meet a series of Chinese Wuxia warriors ready to prove their skills.</p>
<p>The 5 x 3 reel game counts 50 pay lines and gives players the chance to win up to 50,000x the stake. If you are eager to learn more about the slot with cool bonus features and its fantasy theme, keep reading our expert online slot review. We have tested all the features, explored the paytable, and formed our opinion on the slot and we are not ready to share it with you.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Meet Warriors Cloud and Wind</p>
<p>RTG’s talented development crew has once again put all its efforts and dedication into designing the game and using the best graphic quality possible for all the features. The end result is a highly immersive game with stylish anime that displays a temple surrounded by beautiful cherry blossoms in the mountain region covered by snow.</p>
<p>The backdrop is complemented by the symbols that represent the emperor, the princess, and the priest, alongside the standard playing cards. Players who are passionate about fantasy, and Chinese history in general, or lovers of slots with a flawless design will appreciate the game’s theme.</p>
<p>With inspiration from the captivating Chinese Wuxia genre, translated to “martial heroes”, Storm Lords throws the focus on the two main characters who also represent the Storm Lords: warriors Cloud and Wind. The duo, together with the rest of the warriors, live right in the eye of the storm and they are constantly on duty, ready to fight against the enemies that are constantly threatening their people.</p>
<p>Storm Lords: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The studio has chosen 11 nicely-themed symbols for the reels, including the amulet scatter symbol, the coin bonus symbols, and the pair of expanding wild symbols. To score a win, players need to match a minimum of three up to five symbols, respectively. The green amulet symbol pays 2x, 10x, and 100x for combinations of three, spurt, and five identical symbols. 9s and 10x pay 5x, 10x, and 50x for three to five matching symbols, while three to five Js and Qs pay out 5x, 10x, and 80x. Players who land three to five Ks and As will hit the following win multipliers – 10x, 20x, and 100x.</p>
<p>Male characters on a yellow background and female characters on a pink background payout 10x, 50x, and 200x. The game also features two symbols that can pay out for two, three, four, or five symbols on a single payline. They are the male character on a red background which pays 2x, 20x, 80x, and 500x, and both Storm Lords land together, with payouts of 2x, 20x, 80x, and 800x.</p>
<p>The Storm Lord wild symbols replace the standard symbols in the game and they fill the entire reel when they pop on the second and fourth reels.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>RTG has selected a suitable, evocative soundtrack for the game that nicely accompanies the rhythm of the spinning reels. The animations are equally impressive and stunning, perfectly matching the mix of vivid colors and state-of-the-art graphics that make the slot very visually appealing.</p>
<p>Storm Lords Gameplay</p>
<p>While packed with wilds, scatters, multiple free spins, re-spins, and treasure coins, the game is smooth and easy to play on desktop and mobile devices alike. Players need to start by selecting the number of lines they would like to activate and play, then pick the exact amount they would like to stake. This can range between $0.01 and $1 for a single bet line.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the reels, RTG has placed the critical game information such as the bet per line, lines, balance, and total bet. With the help of the arrows placed on both sides of the lines and the bet per line tabs, players can change the number of pay lines and easily grow or decrease the size of their bets.</p>
<p>The icon that displays the stacks of coins located at the left of the Spin tab will help players automatically choose the largest bet possible. The Autoplay feature can be activated by clicking the corresponding icon located to the right of the Spin tab. The game also comes with Turbo mode (lightning sign) which nicely speeds up the action on the spinning reels.</p>
<p>For more detailed information on the payable, pay lines, settings, and overall game action and history, players can simply click the icon showing three lines.</p>
<p>Storm Lords: Wilds, Treasure Coin &amp; Scatters</p>
<p>The game’s wild symbols work by replacing all adjacent symbols with the exception of scatter symbols to generate winning combinations. As previously mentioned, the wilds can be seen popping on the second and fourth reels, further expanding to fill the perspective reels and creating some massive wins for players.</p>
<p>The Treasure Coin feature is triggered when players land a minimum of six treasure coins on any random position on the grid. In exchange, players receive three 3 re-spins while the treasure coins remain locked in place. Lucky players who manage to come across another treasure coin successfully reset the re-spins, further increasing their wins. The total number of coins will eventually determine the size of the wins at the end of the treasure coin feature.</p>
<p>The scatter symbol which is represented by the amulet can also trigger free games when a minimum of three symbols are seen landing during a regular spin. Players can scoop up six free spins with the wild reels. The free spins can also be re-triggered, bringing six additional free games. During the free spins, the Cloud feature and the Wind Wilds will stay locked in position on the second and fourth reels, respectively.</p>
<p>The Treasure Spins feature is similar to the wild reels feature and awards six free games that can trigger an additional treasure coin feature for extra chances to win.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With appealing graphics and a mesmerizing Chinese martial arts theme, Storm Lords is a high-quality slot from RTG with excellent bonus features that add to the excitement of the gameplay during the base game.</p>
