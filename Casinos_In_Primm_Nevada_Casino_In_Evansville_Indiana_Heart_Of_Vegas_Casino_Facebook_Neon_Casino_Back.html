    <h1>Casinos In Primm Nevada Casino In Evansville Indiana Heart Of Vegas Casino Facebook Neon Casino Back</h1>

<p>Hey Nick</p>
<p>They actually waited until it was time to withdraw to inform me that a deposit of $25 needed to be made in the last 30 days to withdrawal. So they returned my winnings and said they were voided and could no longer redeem them.. like what?</p>
<p>It gets even better. Now I have $283 in my cash balance just sitting there so I decided maybe I should and deposit maybe I can claim some portion of my winnings. No, not at all because an error message pops up stating that my cash balance us over $100 and I'm not able to make a deposit at this time...ok what?</p>
<p>Now I'm sitting here unable to withdrawal or deposit with $283 in my cash balance. I contact customer service and they mention that I need to spend the money down to $100 to make a minimum deposit of $25...I'm like wait..What?</p>
<p>I won by using some bonus money I acquired from a challenge a few weeks ago. I was able to complete all levels of the challenge which in turn boosted my cash balance from bonus balance to around $280 which I cannot withdrawal.</p>
<p>This casinos t&amp;c's are out right ridiculous I thought to myself. So idk how to fix this, or if it's even possible but they definitely know what they're doing. I call situations like this with casinos "cash traps"</p>
