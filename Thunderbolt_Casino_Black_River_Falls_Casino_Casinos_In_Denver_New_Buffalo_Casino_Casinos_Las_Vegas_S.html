<p>Los Angeles Rams running back Ronnie Rivers was successful at playing a different kind of game on Saturday. He won more than a half-million dollars while trying his luck at Three Card Poker at Caesars Palace Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The total mega-progressive payout to the young football pro at the Las Vegas Strip gaming property was $514,837. He won with a royal flush between his three cards and the three cards held by the dealer, KTRK, a Houston TV station, reported.</p>
<p>Rivers was in Las Vegas to celebrate his 24th birthday, which was on January 31. He also celebrated his mother’s birthday. He plans to use the jackpot to purchase a house.</p>
<p>Even though he spent the weekend in Vegas, Rivers didn’t participate in this weekend’s Pro Bowl, which was held in Allegiant Stadium. Rivers, who is only 5 feet 9 inches tall, played for the Rams this recent season.</p>
<p>Third Time’s The Charm</p>
<p>Last May, he was signed by the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent. He was released by the team shortly after and then signed by the Seattle Seahawks in August. The Hawks also released him within a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>His luck changed when he signed first to the Rams’ practice squad in September. In November, he made it onto the Rams’ active roster.</p>
<p>Rivers previously played football for the Fresno State Bulldogs. While at Fresno State, he was named to the First team All-Mountain West. Rivers began playing football in high school. He was one of six finalists for Cal-Hi Sports’ Mr. Football State Player of the Year as a senior at Freedom High School.</p>
<p>Not The Only Big Winner</p>
<p>The Caesars Entertainment gaming property handed out several other jackpots in January. On January 30, a mystery player won more than $1 million. The player was on the casino floor at 4 a.m. when they won the $1,040,252. jackpot on a slot machine.</p>
<p>On January 15, another mystery player won a $119K jackpot on a slot at Caesars Palace. On January 13, another unnamed player won two separate $100K jackpots, also at Caesars Palace. The patron hit his first win, which was good for $100,250, at 1:09 a.m. Then, exactly 15 minutes later, at 1:24 a.m., the same player won again. That total was $100,500.</p>
<p>Both wins were on the Triple Play Draw Poker video poker machine.</p>
