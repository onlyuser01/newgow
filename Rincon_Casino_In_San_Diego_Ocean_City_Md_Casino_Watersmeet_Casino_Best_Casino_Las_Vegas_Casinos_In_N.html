<p>The three appointments should aid the government’s ongoing efforts to curtail gambling harm and align with its long-term goals</p>
<p>The New South Wales (NSW) Government has appointed Mr. Chris Bertinshaw as the new Chair of the Responsible Gambling Fund (RGF) alongside two new trustees, aiming to strengthen its commitment to minimizing the adverse impacts of gambling across the region. The three fund members possess significant governance skills and will be instrumental in introducing meaningful change.</p>
<p>NSW Remains Committed to Public Welfare</p>
<p>RGF Trustees are entrusted with recommending the utilization of funds for various initiatives related to gambling harm minimization, including research, community education, support services, and policy assistance. Their expertise and guidance are also invaluable in shaping gambling policies, as the Trust holds a vital representative position on the government’s Independent Panel on Gaming Reform.</p>
<p>Minister for Gaming and Racing David Harris emphasized that the new appointments underscore the government’s dedication to addressing gambling-related harm throughout the state. The RGF Trust receives its funding through a levy on casinos and is a vital component in the government’s efforts to curtail the region’s growing problem gambling concerns.</p>
<p>“The RGF enables NSW to support world-leading programs, services, and campaigns to reduce gambling harm in our communities.” David Harris, NSW Minister for Gaming and Racing</p>
<p>Minister Harris thanked outgoing RGF Chair John Dalzell for his exceptional leadership since 2017. Dalzell oversaw revamping the GambleAware service delivery model and a substantial expansion of education and awareness initiatives supported by the fund. Harris used the opportunity to highlight the government’s ongoing support via an additional $10 million to the RGF across 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>Bertinshaw and His Colleagues Are Seasoned Professionals</p>
<p>The newly appointed leaders are poised to serve three-year terms. Chris Bertinshaw, the RGF’s new Chair, brings over three decades of experience in governance and public health. His extensive background as Chair of the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District Board and as a CEO of various organizations positions him to provide valuable strategic direction to the RGF.</p>
<p>Anastasia Polites and Steven Gal will also be invaluable additions as Trustees. Polites has an extensive background in employment and industrial relations law, while Gal brings a wealth of expertise in health and community development, having led funding reforms across diverse populations. They join the three existing reappointed trustees, Anne Fitzgerald, Robert Lagaida, and Professor Joel Negin.</p>
<p>“The three new trustees reflect an impressive diversity of experience across health, governance, law, public policy, and serving underrepresented communities.” David Harris, NSW Minister for Gaming and Racing</p>
<p>These new appointments are a testament to the government’s unwavering dedication to addressing the challenges posed by gambling. The additions to the RGF team boast impressive leadership skills and board experience, which will be valuable assets to the Trust as it works to prioritize the welfare of NSW citizens and minimize gambling harm within communities.</p>
