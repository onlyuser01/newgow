<p>Dear pashudada87,</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly the transaction was deducted from your wallet but wasn't credited to the casino balance?</p>
<p>If your deposit has never been credited to your casino account, the only thing I would recommend is contacting your payment provider. They need to investigate, but bear in mind, that it’s a complicated process that might take up to one month approximately. In these cases, the casino usually has its hands tied. I would also strongly recommend against depositing any more funds until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>If the money got lost during the transaction, it’s going to take some time before it’ll be credited to your casino account or returned to your bank account or e-wallet.</p>
<p>I’m sorry that we couldn’t be of much help at this time. I will leave this complaint open for a month and kindly ask you to keep us updated. Thank you very much for your understanding.</p>
