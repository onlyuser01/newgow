    <h1>Riverstar Casino Four Winds Casino Michigan Caf Casino Prism Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Pa Online</h1>

<p>I registered at casimba recently and made 3 welcome deposits, 1st deposit $333, 2nd deposit $1000, 3rd deposit $1000. I had some lucky wins and yesterday (31st of December 2019) I wanted to withdraw $5000, which left me roughly $3400 in the casimba account. The welcome bonus has been completed well before that time. A few hours later, the withdrawal was cancelled, all of my winnings were confiscated. I received an email from casimba accounts stating that I breached clause 6 in terms of conditions which states" Clause 6 - The maximum bet allowed while the Welcome Bonus is in play is NZD 5. Should You bet higher than this while the Welcome bonus is in play, the Casino reserves the right to confiscate all winnings.</p>
<p>During play, while the welcome bonus was active, I never bet higher than $5, apart from certain slots where you can buy the bonus for a particular game. One of the games that I really enjoyed playing was buffalo rising megaways, where you can buy the bonus at different stakes up to $20 stake, in my case I bought the bonus several times for $400 (the bonus buy is 100x the initial bet of $4). After reviewing my account history I noticed that casimba considers a bonus buy of $400 at buffalo rising as a maximum bet. However, in terms and conditions this is not clearly stated that bonus buys are maximum bets and therefore not allowed while the welcome bonus in play. From my perspective a bonus buy of $400 at buffalo rising is a $4 bet, but because it’s a bonus buy its x100 the bet and that is how I interpreted the terms and conditions not exceeding the $5 bet limit. For example, If i choose a bonus buy of $800 (100x$8) at buffalo rising, its a $8 bet then I would have breached the terms and conditions, however i did not do that. Casimba’s terms and conditions are designed with a number of loopholes, that are subject of interpretation and were deceiving and misleading me. I been trying to get in touch with the personel who manually removed all my winnings from my casimba account without success. There is several questions which I would like to get an answer to:</p>
<p>Why was I allowed to make 3rd deposit under the welcome bonus even though according to casimba I breached clause 6 on the 26th of December 2019?</p>
<p>Why is it not clearly stated in the terms and conditions that bonus buys are not allowed while welcome bonus is in play?</p>
<p>Why is it not clearly stated in terms and conditions that bonus buys are considered maximum bets? Some slots have two betting options, the normal bet per stake and also the bonus buy which is 100x (e.g. buffalo rising megaways?)</p>
<p>Why are winnings only confiscated after you decide to withdraw money and not as soon as you breach clause 6?</p>
<p>This is unfair because once the bonus is complete if you strike big which I have, you have the illusion of winning money, and that is deceiving and unfair play, and as such I am requesting casimba to make changes to their modus operandi.</p>
<p>I kindly request you to review Casimba’s terms and conditions and force them to make it more clear and transparent, especially about the bonus buy to prevent other players from being stripped of their winnings. Furthermore, I kindly request you to review my account history and reconsider casimba's actions taken against me of confiscating all my winnings. Currently, my account has been locked as of now.</p>
