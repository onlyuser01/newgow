    <h1>Westgate Casino Las Vegas Queens Casino Big Fish Casino Login Casino In Wheeling Wv Cherokee Casinos</h1>

<p>The leading content-driven iGaming technology provider, Bragg Gaming Group, continues its US expansion after announcing a new launch. On Monday, the company revealed it has launched its leading content and technology in New Jersey with the famous sports betting and entertainment company, DraftKings.</p>
<p>Thanks to the launch, proprietary content from Bragg's Atomic Slot Lab studio, including Fairy Dust, the Girl with the Golden Eyes and Egyptian Magic launched with the operator in the Garden State. What's more, the collaboration brought premium content from Bragg's partner studios. As a result, new titles and premium games are now available to New Jersey customers at DraftKings' casino.draftkings.com.</p>
<p>In a statement released on January 30, 2023, Bragg's Chief Operating Officer and President, Lara Falzon, said: "The launch of our new proprietary and exclusive third-party content with DraftKings in New Jersey demonstrates the continued success of our initiative to expand existing relationships with leading North American iGaming operators."</p>
<p>According to her, Bragg's launch of new content and Remote Game Server (RGS) technology with DraftKings marks a milestone moment for the company. Falzon predicted that entering such a strategic US jurisdiction will help Bragg continue its expansion across the country, allowing its content to reach new players in important online gambling markets.</p>
<p>Finally, Bragg's President and Chief Operating Officer said: "We are pleased to build on our relationship with DraftKings and look forward to providing their New Jersey players with engaging content that delivers a great gaming entertainment experience."</p>
<p>The recent launch in New Jersey further strengthens the collaboration between Bragg and DraftKings in North America. In fact, the latest launch builds upon a strong foundation between the duo after the recent launch of Bragg's RGS content and technology with DraftKings in Michigan, another key US jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Besides the introduction of RGS technology and content in Michigan last year, the duo collaborated for Bragg's Spin Games RGS in a total of four states including New Jersey, Michigan, Connecticut, as well as Pennsylvania. Now, the latest extension of the collaboration between Bragg and DraftKings further solidifies their North American-facing partnership.</p>
<p>Citing research from H2 Gambling Capital, Bragg explained that the online gambling market in New Jersey is expected to rake in $1.8 billion in gross win this year, making the latest deal a strategic move.</p>
<p>The partnership with DraftKings comes on the heels of another deal inked by Bragg. Earlier this month, the company joined forces with Swinnt, forming a new content alliance.</p>
