<p>Demetrious Johnson Going for the GOAT Status</p>
<p>Many believe that Demetrious Johnson is the best flyweight fighter in the history of mixed martial arts. Now a 36-year-old, he used to be the UFC Flyweight Champion for several years. In fact, after winning the title in 2012, he went on to defend it 11 times.</p>
<p>It was Henry Cejudo who ended Mighty Mouse’s reign in 2018, winning the title fight by a split decision. After that fight, Johnson decided to move to the ONE Championship, where his journey started with three wins in a row.</p>
<p>But then, he got a chance to fight Adriano Moraes for the title in 2021. Johnson entered the cage as the betting favorite, but his opponent shocked everyone by beating him with a knockout (grounded knee – a move legal in ONE Championship) in Round 2. It was Johnson’s first-ever loss inside the distance.</p>
<p>Those who believed the KO loss was nothing other than a glitch in the matrix were proved correct in the rematch some 16 months later. In August last year, Johnson got his revenge on Moraes, beating him by KO and winning the ONE Championship Flyweight title. Now, it’s time for the two foes to meet for the third time.</p>
<p>Can Adriano Moraes Beat Mighty Mouse Twice?</p>
<p>Moraes is five inches taller than Mighty Mouse and has three inches longer reach. He used this to his advantage in their first fight – keeping his opponent at a distance and throwing a multitude of strikes at him.</p>
<p>It was a short uppercut that put Johnson to the floor in the first fight, after which a grounded knee followed that won the fight for Moraes.</p>
<p>In the rematch, Moraes did okay boxing-wise throughout the first couple of rounds. It was the penultimate round when everything fell apart for the Brazilian. DJ hit him with a right hook, with a flying knee coming as a follow-up, which knocked Moraes out cold.</p>
<p>Demetrious Johnson vs Adriano Moraes Prediction</p>
<p>Adriano Moraes has already proved to the world that he’s one hell of a fighter. Still, the fact is that Demetrius Johnson is better. DJ wasn’t lucky in the first fight against Moraes, plus he wasn’t overly familiar with the rules of the promotion (e.g., grounded knee).</p>
<p>However, in their second fight, he reminded everyone why he’s considered a GOAT candidate. We’re certain he’s going to do the same in Johnson vs Moraes 3.</p>
<p>Pick: Demetrius Johnson to win</p>
