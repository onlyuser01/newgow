    <h1>Odawa Casino Petoskey Grand Rush Casino Online Casino Singapore Hooters Casino Las Vegas Casino Slot</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I deposited 400 EUR with Brite to play at Freshspins. Before doing so I carefully checked their bonus terms and especially what is the maximum bet and what games are excluded from playing with bonus funds.</p>
<p>The wagering was a very large one, 24000 EUR.</p>
<p>I managed to clear the wagering and was left with a balance of 4100 EUR. However today I noticed that instead of processing my withdrawal of 4100 EUR they only paid back 400 EUR instead of 4100 EUR. So less than 10% of the money I won.</p>
<p>When I asked about this in chat they said they have a right to close my account as per their T&amp;C. I read the T&amp;C they pasted to me and agree they have a right to close my account. However they do not have a right to take my money.</p>
<p>Also worth nothing that they did not close my account, even though that is what they said. They only took my money and I am still able to log in. Even the deposit button still works and it is offering me some freespins on my next deposit.</p>
<p>Please Freshspins pay me my winnings, you can close the account if you want.</p>
<p>They did not inform me of any of this before I went to chat so I asked them to email me. This is the email I received:</p>
