<p>Paysafe has extended its partnership with PointsBet to add Michigan to its list of gambling markets supported by the payment service provider.</p>
<p>PointsBet Has Launched Michigan Operations</p>
<p>Specialist payments platform provider Paysafe has announced the expansion of its partnership agreement with leading sportsbook operator PointsBet to add Michigan to its list of supported gambling markets.</p>
<p>PointsBet just recently launched its sports betting operations in Michigan under its trademark. The operator had already been using Paysafe’s services in five regulated US markets.</p>
<p>In addition to standard fixed-odds betting, the sports betting firm offers innovative features such as a spread betting model called “PointsBetting“.</p>
<p>Customers in Michigan can now deposit money using credit and debit cards processed via Paysafe’s payment system. They can also use ACH (automated clearing house) bank transfers from checking and savings accounts, thanks to PointsBet’s new integration with Paysafe. Similar deposit strategies are available in the other five states where the sportsbook operates.</p>
<p>Paysafe’s Long-Term Strategy</p>
<p>Paysafe will also increase its presence in the US online gaming market, where it has recently announced multiple partnerships and is working on long-term expansion as more states regulate the industry.</p>
<p>With the authorization of the Gaming Control Board, Michigan was able to launch its regulated iGaming market on January 22. About $115 million were generated in online bets in the first 10 days of operation, the regulator said.</p>
<p>Gregory Kirstein, the Director of Business Development for iGaming at Paysafe, declared that PointsBet’s dedication to providing premium cutting–edge sports wagering content has solidified its status as a leader in the quickly growing US iGaming market.</p>
<p>“We look forward to building on an already fruitful relationship by supporting the Michigan launch through our payment processing services, which streamline the customer payments journey and drive long-term loyalty,” Kirstein declared.</p>
<p>Originally from Australia, PointsBet debuted in the US in 2019, following approval from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE). The operator went on to collaborate with the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, NJ.</p>
<p>Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and New Jersey are the six states where the company is currently operational. These jurisdictions are covered by the operator’s partnership with Paysafe.</p>
