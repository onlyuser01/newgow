    <h1>Silverton Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Casino In Iowa Sign Up Bonus Casino Casino Shelbyville Indiana</h1>

<p>Hi gianluca</p>
<p>We have investigated your concerns and here are our findings:</p>
<p>On the 29th of November 2019, you were informed that your withdrawal request of €6000 was cancelled due to irregular play.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions of the casino are presented to all players before they created an account at the casino and it explicitly informs the players of the following:</p>
<p>"If you do not agree with any of the terms of this Agreement, do not click "I agree", do not continue to use the website, download, install or otherwise use the software, and remove the software from your computer."</p>
<p>Once a player clicked "I AGREE" it signifies that they understood the terms and agreed to abide the rules of the casino.</p>
<p>Rules are commonplace in the industry. At our casino, we make a point of having the rules in plain sight. Some feel that our terms do not fit their play and decide not to play or create an account. In your case, you made the active choice to play.</p>
<p>Your winnings were voided as you have broken the terms and conditions of the casino "Placing single bets equal to or higher than 30% of the most recent deposit in play, if it is smaller than the bonus." Your deposit in play was €150 and therefore you are not allowed to place bets equal or more than €45. Your gameplay shows that you made bets ranging from €47 to €100, on blackjack and sports bet.</p>
<p>On 14th December 2019, in light of your complaint the casino had offered you €400 as a goodwill gesture and the closure of this case. On the very same day, you’ve cancelled the pending withdrawal of €400, played and lost. Thereafter, you proceeded to reopen the case despite your agreement. Again, as a goodwill gesture, the casino has refunded you €400.</p>
<p>Please be advised that you are welcome to send the complaint for review to our regulating authority and we will be providing the same information with evidence.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>WhiteLion Bets Casino</p>
