<p>Major League Baseball has secured a first partnership in Latin America with sports and gaming operator Betcris.</p>
<p>Betcris Becomes Official Latin American Partner for MLB</p>
<p>Sports betting operator Betcris and Major League Baseball (MLB) have teamed up for Latin America, with the sportsbook now the official MLB partner for the region. As per the deal, Betcris is an official partner for the company in Latin America, although their partnership stretches internationally.</p>
<p>Betcris can now use MLB branding products, such as the league’s logos on both the sportsbook’s website as well as wagering app. Betcris will also advertise and market a string of league events. The sportsbook will broadcast MLB Jewel Events.</p>
<p>This will happen in every market where Betcris holds an official license to operate in. Furthermore, Betcris will make sure to hold the integrity of baseball games by upholding industry standards to avoid foul play.</p>
<p>Betcris’ chief executive JD Duarte was excited with the news, arguing that teaming up with MLB has offered the company extensive opportunities. It has also highlighted the dedicated effort that Betcris has put in improving its own offer. He also added:</p>
<p>“This partnership will strengthen Betcris’ position in the gaming industry by allowing us to cover all the action in the field and it could not come at a better time. We share a vision with MLB to deliver fun and exciting content to our audiences and that starts with the 2020 season.” -Betcris chief executive JD Duarte</p>
<p>Betcris is excited to be part of MLB family in one way or another, Duarte explained, and he highlighted the difficulties in the past, citing the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) which restricted most sports betting in the United States before a Supreme Court ruling defeated the legislation in 2018.</p>
<p>MLB’s Popularity and Expansion Moves</p>
<p>Betcris, though, doesn’t operate in the United States specifically. The company is based in Malta, and it has headquarters in Costa Rica where its parent company, TV Global Enterprises is based.</p>
<p>However, Costa Rica is considered a restricted area to US sports fans in terms of betting opportunities. The bookie’s main footprint lies in Latin America and specifically Peru, Panama and Mexico.</p>
<p>Kenny Gersh, executive VP of Gaming and new business ventures at MLB, has also welcomed the partnership. Gersh said that many of MLB’s most loyal fans lived in Latin America and it was important to find the right gaming partner to offer something in return to all the passionate audiences in the region.</p>
<p>“Betcris has taken great strides in recent years to listen to their users and continually offer great services and we believe their experience will only further elevate the engagement opportunities for our Latin American fans.” -MLB VP of Gaming and Business Ventures, Kenny Gersh</p>
<p>MLB continues to expand its footprint after previously this week, the league has teamed up with Tabcorp, an Australian sport betting operator and owner of a sports TV network.</p>
<p>Australia, Tabcorp and MLB have said, has a growing interest for American sports and securing an official partnership in the country was the right move.</p>
<p>MLB today is popular in Australia, Latin America, the United Kingdom, and especially Japan, which is one of the main markets.</p>
