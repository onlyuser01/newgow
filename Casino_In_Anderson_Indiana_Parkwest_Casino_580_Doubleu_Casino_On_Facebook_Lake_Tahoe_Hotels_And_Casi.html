<p>Our Argentina vs Saudi Arabia prediction is that La Albiceleste are going to win on Tuesday morning. We’re 100% sure of that. Unfortunately, bookies share our opinion, which is why they’re giving extremely short odds on Argentina, somewhere in the ballpark of -625.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are many other bets available, including the spread (a.k.a. Asian handicap), goals over/under, and many other betting markets. Then, there are also some 2022 World Cup props worth checking out, including those focused on players.</p>
<p>In our Argentina vs Saudi Arabia preview, we’re going to analyze all of the aforementioned bets, sharing our top picks along the way.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi in the Spotlight</p>
<p>Lionel Messi is probably the best soccer player in history, but his story is coming to an end. He’s now 35, meaning that it’s very unlikely he’s going to play in the 2026 World Cup. That said, the tournament in Qatar may be his “last dance.”</p>
<p>Argentina’s captain should have a good time in Qatar. He’s 100% injury free and has been playing good soccer over the last couple of weeks. Messi also has plenty of motivation to excel in the 2022 World Cup. The thing is that his national team hasn’t won the trophy since the days of Diego Armando Maradona.</p>
<p>Another great thing for Argentina is that they’re drawn into Group C, which is arguably the easiest group in the tourney. They’re expected to finish above Mexico, Poland, and Saudi Arabia, which is the biggest underdog in the 2022 World Cup.</p>
<p>Is Saudi Arabia Really the Worst Team in the Tournament?</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia might be the very worst team taking part in the Qatar tournament. Oddsmakers are giving +30000 on this team lifting the trophy, which practically means that such a scenario is impossible to play out.</p>
<p>We think these guys are going to have a horrible time in Qatar, especially in the first game. The thing is that they’re playing against one of the main title favorites, a team that’s superb in the offense. Meanwhile, the Saudi offense doesn’t look very lethal.</p>
<p>This team has scored only seven goals in 14 games played in 2022. None of those games was against a team that’s as strong as Argentina.</p>
<p>Argentina vs Saudi Arabia Prediction</p>
<p>Argentina will obliterate Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, putting away at least a couple of goals. We believe that many of those goals will be the work of Lionel Messi. In fact, we think he could even score a hat-trick in this game.</p>
<p>When it comes to Saudi Arabia, we just can’t see this team scoring. That said, a blowout win for Argentina is the most likely outcome in our opinion.</p>
<p>Picks: Argentina (-2.5); over 2.5 goals; Lionel Messi to score</p>
