<p>Sky Betting &amp; Gaming has announced that it donated over £250,000 ($313,500) to support the Children’s Heart Surgery Fund in Yorkshire</p>
<p>Premier online betting operator in the UK by number of customers that provides pre-match and in-play odds in a variety of markets, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming (Sky Bet), has made a donation of over £250,000 ($313,500) to the Children’s Heart Surgery Fund (CHSF), one of Yorkshire’s top charities.</p>
<p>The announcement was made during SBG’s Annual Charity Gala held in Leeds earlier in the week when hundreds of staff members and guests reunited for a fund-raiser hosted by ITV Racing’s Oli Bell and Ed Chamberlin.</p>
<p>Flutter UK &amp; Ireland Donated £120,000</p>
<p>While the silent auction, sponsorship packages, Mascot Race, and raffle prizes all contributed to raising an important amount throughout the night, Sky Bet’s parent company Flutter UK &amp; Ireland (Flutter UKI) decided to add a further £120,000 to the list of donations.</p>
<p>This way, the Leeds Congenital Heart Unit will afford to buy a new, top-tier echo software package that would allow them to use advanced software for highly detailed heart analysis.</p>
<p>At the head of the year, the staff at Sky Bet voted to support the CHSF. Ever since they have been involved in a series of fund-raising challenges and activities with the goal of raising money for the charity that does not receive any funds from the government.</p>
<p>In the past eight years since it has been running its charity event, Sky Bet has managed to raise approximately £800,000 ($872,000) that reached local and nationwide charities. The list includes Macmillan Cancer, the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, Support Dogs, and Teenage Cancer.</p>
<p>The company’s chief commercial officer, Steve Birch, called the Charity Gala one of their “proudest moments” while praising the work done by the staff to raise money for the cause that he called exceptional.</p>
<p>The Children’s Heart Surgery Fund (CHSF) is a not-for-profit organization that provides lifesaving and life-changing support for children with congenital heart disease across Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Sky Bet’s “Life-Changing” Contribution, Praised by CHSF</p>
<p>CHSF’s head of marketing, Andy McNally, spoke about the “life-changing contribution from Sky Betting &amp; Gaming and Flutter UKI” that is expected to make a huge difference in terms of treatment for patients suffering from congenital heart diseases.</p>
<p>He added that the fresh donations will support both patients and their families and provide them with the “best possible experience” at the Congenital Heart Unit as well as other 19 cardiac clinics in the area.</p>
<p>McNally thanked the Sky Bet staff and everyone who helped organize the event. Each year, the CHSF takes in more than 17,000 patients of all ages.</p>
<p>In August, Sky Betting and Gaming announced it would continue to promote safer gambling practices together with the English Football League.</p>
