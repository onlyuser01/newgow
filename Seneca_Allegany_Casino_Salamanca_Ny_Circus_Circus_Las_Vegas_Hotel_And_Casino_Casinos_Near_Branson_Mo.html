<p>Is gambling legal in Mississippi? The gambling industry in MS is an interesting one. You can enjoy a wide range of playing options, from sports betting to horse racing. But online gambling has been pushed aside and still remains illegal to this day. Keep reading to learn more.</p>
<p>Mississippi gambling laws</p>
<p>According to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, online gambling is illegal. While online casinos can advertise the forms of gambling they offer, it is illegal to bet at these sites from within the state.</p>
<p>The gambling age in Mississippi?</p>
<p>If you wish to partake in any form of gambling in Mississippi, whether it's at a land based casino or purchasing tickets from the state lottery, the minimum age is 21. Certain tribal land based casinos may allow players 18 years of age, but 21 is the average age at most casinos in MS.</p>
<p>Are there taxes on gambling winnings?</p>
<p>According to Mississippi online gambling laws, all winnings are taxable and must be declared on your tax return. The winnings are subject to a 3% non-refundable income tax, and most casinos withhold this tax when paying out winnings.</p>
<p>How are online casinos regulated?</p>
<p>While many bills have been submitted (and failed), there is still hope that online casinos in Mississippi will soon be a reality. Right now, standard online and mobile casinos are not legal in the state, but online gambling does exist in a very limited manner. A few land based casinos feature an app that can only be accessed when on the casino grounds. It provides a sense of gambling "online" while still being within the legal bounds of the casino's jurisdiction.</p>
