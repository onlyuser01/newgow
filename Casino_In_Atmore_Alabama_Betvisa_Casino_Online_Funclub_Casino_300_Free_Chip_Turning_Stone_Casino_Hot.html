<p>Dear LouAnn123,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding the relevant screenshot:</p>
<p>I’m sorry to hear about your problem. However, please note that on the first screenshot the casino email address is not correct.</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gambling section on the website, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion</p>
<ol>
<li>We realize that cases might occur where Registered Customers’ gambling might grow into a serious problem; hence we offer a self-exclusion option for a period from six months up to five years, or permanent self-exclusion as per Registered Customer's request. If you require to self-exclude yourself, please get in touch with us on support@betobet.com using your registered e-mail address, with the subject "Self Exclusion" specifying the period you wish to be self-excluded for. Please take under consideration, that only upon a clearly stated self-exclusion request will the access to your Account be denied to you as per the agreed upon timeframe. Otherwise all accounts shall be treated as simply "closed" and can be reopened at any time upon Registered Customer's request. Bet O bet is responsible for keeping self-excluded only the Accounts which are specifically mentioned in the Registered Customer's request. The Company takes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any Duplicated Accounts connected to the closed or self-excluded one(s)."</li>
</ol>
<p>Could you please advise if you have tried contacting Customer Support between 18/04/2022 and 24/05/2022?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
