    <h1>Carnival City Casino Nugget Casino Hotel Sparks Lake Charles Hotels Near Casino Downtown Grand Hotel</h1>

<p>iGaming developer and aggregator of content Relax Gaming has struck a new landmark deal with bet365. Thanks to this partnership, bet365’s players will have access to a number of Relax Gaming’s in-house slot games, including Money Train 2, Snake Arena, and Temple Tumble to name a few.</p>
<p>Bet365 Gets Access to Relax Gaming’s Titles and Partners</p>
<p>By signing this partnership, bet365 attests to Relax Gaming’s pulling power with the iGaming community as the company has established itself as one of the most innovative and worthwhile developers of content both through aggregating it from third parties and developing it in its dedicated studios.</p>
<p>Apart from the existing Relax Gaming portfolio, bet365 players will also have access to a number of other titles by those same third parties. Relax has hand-picked more than 50 casino suppliers and partners who are available through the Powered By Relax and Silver Bullet partnership programs.</p>
<p>The partnership with Relax marks bet365’s ambitions to be seen as more than the world’s leading sports betting operator. The company hopes to achieve a more prominent status in iGaming as well, appealing to new audiences and improving the experience for existing customers.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard was pleased with the opportunity to team up with bet365 and expand this partnership with the operator. She added:</p>
<p>Naturally, bet365 needs no introduction. As the biggest operator in our sector, taking our products to live with them is a hugely important moment for us as we continue to expand at pace. Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard</p>
<p>Attard said that Relax Gaming was delighted to be a part of this partnership and was thankful that bet365 has chosen to trust it. Relax Gaming most recently added fresh content from Peter &amp; Sons and it listed Apparat Gaming’s products on its list of available partners as well.</p>
