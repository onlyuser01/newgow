<p>The deal is an important part of Bragg’s growth strategy for 2023 which will see them further expand their global geographical reach.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group, a content-driven iGaming technology provider, has expanded its footprint in Switzerland through a new agreement with Pasino.ch. As agreed, the provider will supply the online operator with iGaming content.</p>
<p>Pasino.ch, which is the online arm of the Geneva-based Casino Du Lac Meyrin SA, will thus be able to offer a selection of Bragg’s top titles, driving customer engagement and providing fans with unforgettable experiences.</p>
<p>Pasino.ch’s parent casino is furthermore a member of the French Groupe Partouche, one of the largest French gambling holdings. The group operates a number of brick-and-mortar casinos across France, Switzerland, Belgium and Tunisia.</p>
<p>The operator has been a major player in Switzerland since the European country legalized online gambling in 2019. Bragg Gaming will therefore be able to grow its brand as many more people in the country will have access to its games.</p>
<p>Bragg’s content has a proven appeal to European audiences and Swiss players. The launch with Pasino.ch further cements the provider as a leading European gambling supplier.</p>
<p>The Deal Is a Part of Bragg’s 2023 Strategy</p>
<p>Lara Falzon, Bragg Gaming Group’s president and chief operating officer, commented on the new agreement, saying that the Swiss market is fast-growing and very promising. The agreement with Groupe Partouche, Falzon said, will “significantly strengthen” the company’s presence in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Falzon added that the agreement is a major step in Bragg’s growth journey and an important part of its growth strategy.</p>
<p>The relationship is an important part of our growth strategy for 2023 which will see us further expand our global geographical reach with established names such as Groupe Partouche. Lara Falzon, president &amp; COO, Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rupert Ecker, Pasino.ch’s managing director, lauded Bragg Gaming Group’s portfolio of games, saying that they are sure to bring great entertainment to the operator’s players. He added that the new integration will allow the gambling company to remain competitive.</p>
<p>Bragg’s collection of games brings great entertainment to our players and is a valuable addition to our licensed Swiss online casino. Staying competitive through a wide and constantly growing offering is crucial to us, and Bragg provides proven titles that will ensure we stay ahead of the game. Rupert Ecker, MD, Pasino.ch</p>
