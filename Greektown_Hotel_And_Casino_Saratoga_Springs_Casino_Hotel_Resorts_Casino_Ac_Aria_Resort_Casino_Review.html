    <h1>Greektown Hotel And Casino Saratoga Springs Casino Hotel Resorts Casino Ac Aria Resort Casino Review</h1>

<p>Malta-based Nasdaq-listed online publisher Raketech Group Holding PLC (Raketech) has announced the nomination of two new managing directors. The new senior management board members will be responsible for overseeing the company’s operations in Malta and the US.</p>
<p>The appointments are a result of Raketech’s desire to see its commercial objectives for 2022 grow at a faster rate. The company also plans to intensify further the presence of its media network across several regulated markets specializing in online gambling.</p>
<p>Ian Hills and Danielle Parsons to Bring Their Expertise to the Table</p>
<p>By onboarding Danielle Parsons and Ian Hills to manage their US and Malta operations, Raketech is expecting to harness the impressive industry expertise of the duo and use it to its best advantage.</p>
<p>To accept the new Raketech position for its American branch, Parsons has given up her position as a senior director of product partnerships at GAN, a top supplier of iGaming systems for the land-based American market.</p>
<p>Parsons will be the new managing director for North America, where she will oversee the company’s media portfolio performance. The portfolio was expanded in 2021 when the company took over Statsalt.com, Winnersandwhiners.com, and Pickpapa.com, the most successful communities of sports tipsters in the industry.</p>
<p>Hills also had to leave behind his positions as general manager and head of finance and commercial planning at Blexr Media, one o fRaketech’s main competitors, to join the Malta board of senior directors.</p>
<p>In the past, Hills was also a financial controller for Mr Green and Mansa Gaming. His new responsibility will be to manage the daily operations of Raketech’s headquarter in Malta. At the same time, Hills will use his experience to support the company’s international teams in quickly reaching their goals.</p>
<p>Raketech’s Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for governing all operations while tackling all administrative and organizational tasks together with the business affairs of the Group. All of these operations are completed while fully complying with Malta’s strict laws and under the close governance of Chapter386 of the Laws of Malta, including the Maltese Companies Act of 1995 and the company’s memorandum.</p>
<p>Plus, starting June 28, 2018, when the company started trading on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market, Raketech started to apply the Swedish Corporate Governance Code. Both Parsons and Hills will need to manage all operations in their assigned jurisdictions while fully complying with these regulations. At the same time, they will direct all their efforts towards taking over more markets while strengthening their presence on the European continent.</p>
<p>Raketech, Proud of the New Nominations</p>
<p>The Group has expressed its belief that both Danielle Parsons and Ian Hills will successfully reach their goals while bringing more than two decades and half of industry experience to the table. Having worked with some of the most prestigious companies in the online gambling world, the two should assist Raketech with the company’s accelerated growth strategy. At the same time, they are expected to pave the way for even more resounding successes in fresh markets.</p>
<p>Last November, Raketech acquired ATS Consultants, a sports market tipster affiliate for $15.5 million, while also recording a growth of over 30% in revenue during the third quarter compared to previous year’s numbers. Raketech is on the right track and the two new managing directors might be just what the company needs to hit the gas pedal and reach their final destination a lot sooner.</p>
