<p>The Houston Astros claimed the World Series title on Saturday night, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 4-1 in Game 6. The team’s hard-won victory also provides the background for possibly the biggest win in sports betting history. Famous furniture businessman, philanthropist, and gambler Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale walked away with $75 million after betting a substantial sum on his favorite team.</p>
<p>The Winnings Will Go to Promotions and Charity</p>
<p>Mattress Mack is not new to the world of high-stakes gambling. Last year, he wagered $9.5 million on last season’s Super Bowl but lost them all after the Cincinnati Bengals failed to secure a victory. However, the savvy businessman reportedly used the opportunity to sell $ 20 million in furniture in game-related promotions, essentially hedging his bets.</p>
<p>McIngvale appears to have taken a similar approach with this most recent wager, offering Gallery Furniture clients substantial promotions should the Astros claim the title. Thanks to the team’s victory, all customers who purchased select products worth over $5,000 during the bonus campaign are now eligible to receive double their paid amount. The gesture is part of McIngvale’s desire to give back to the community.</p>
<p>Whatever we can do to make people’s lives better even if it’s through this magical game of baseball, we will. Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale</p>
<p>As a well-known philanthropist, McIngvale used the opportunity to give away 200 mattresses to Houston first responders and veterans. He regularly uses his gambling winnings for generous promotions and charity, often standing among the first to help during extreme weather emergencies like the 2021 Texas power crisis and winter storms.</p>
<p>McIngvale Cements His Place as a Houston Icon</p>
<p>To achieve the world-breaking winnings, McIngvale had to spread his $10 million wager across several sportsbooks like BetMGM, WynnBet, Betfred, and Barstool. The biggest bet happened at Caesars, who will have to pay the lucky entrepreneur $30,000,000. Ken Fuchs, Caesars Entertainment’s head of sports, congratulated McIngvale on his win:</p>
<p>“What can we say? We just wrote the biggest check in sports betting history. Would we do it all again? You bet.” Ken Fuchs, head of sports at Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>McIngvale’s contributions to Houston did not go unnoticed, as he was selected to throw out the ceremonial first pitch ahead of the final game, making the Astros’ eventual victory even more emotional. The tycoon later shared a photo of his winnings using his official Twitter profile, using the opportunity to thank his community for their continued support, promising to do all he could to give back to the city.</p>
