<p>Together with its gaming studio subsidiary 1x2gaming, 1x2 Network has added yet another revolutionary title to its prestigious branded content with a clear focus on gamification. The developer has released Branded Coin Vault, a mining-themed slot game that allows operators to customize the game’s logo, select their preferred size for the gameboard, or change the number of mines popping on the reels. The developer will use William Hill as the pioneer operator to introduce the game to players eager to gain more control over their gaming.</p>

<p>1×2 Network Continues Its Shift toward Gamification</p>
<p>Without a doubt, 1×2 Network is eager to be a part of the unavoidable shift toward gamification in the gambling industry that was initiated a few years ago. Players are thirsty for more gamified elements. This means they want to be given the chance to use more skill and strategy to improve their chances of winning. Accordingly, the developer created the Arcade Games suite of games that fall right into these criteria. These games provide players a different gameplay experience that does not exclusively rely on chance and randomness. The games come with a classic, old-school 80s arcade gaming feel, excellent mechanics, and impressive payout potential. They also allow players to opt for different gameplay session lengths. The portfolio includes titles like mine Games, Pop ‘Til You Drop, Coin Field, and Coin Vault. The newly released Branded Coin Vault slot game perfectly matches the aesthetics and type of gameplay found in the Coin Vault variant that it is based on. The new game features fluctuating RTPs (88%, 93%, 95%, 97%) and a maximum payout of €250,000 ($269,000).</p>
<p>Enter the Vault at Your Own Risk</p>
<p>Branded Coin Vault invites players to enter a bank vault at their own risk while grabbing their attention with eye-catching neon purple design elements that glow. The symbols are represented by bank cells. Every time a new cell opens, players’ winnings go up. Players must focus on avoiding the mines or else they will lose their winnings.</p>
<p>Operators will get to customize the game’s logo, change the colors of all animations and give the background a completely new look to match and leverage their brand aesthetics and reputation.</p>
<p>1×2 Network’s account management and marketing director Rory Kimber believes the Branded Megaways collection “took the industry by storm” while expressing certainty that Branded Coin Vault will have the same impact on operators and players.</p>
<p>At the beginning of April, William Hill paid one lucky player over $36,000 for a $1.31 wager. The operator that was founded in 1934 currently has 10 licenses in different European and South American countries.</p>
