    <h1>Apache Casino Lawton Ok Talking Sticks Casino Casino In Florida Emerald Queen Casino And Hotel Fife</h1>

<p>NetBet continues to deliver state-of-the-art iGaming solutions in the Italian market with the addition of products by Play’n Go. The move is designed to strengthen the online casino operator’s rapport with both local gamers as well as its existing relationship with the supplier of leading iGaming solutions.</p>
<p>Operating out of Malta, Play’n Go is the author of a plethora of successful iGaming products with the motto “WE ARE GAME.” The company has introduced a number of slots, including branded games, dynamic payways, grid slots, and more.</p>
<p>It has worked on fixed odds, table games, and video bingo, with some of the latest games on the Play’n Go portfolio, including Captain Xeno’s Earth Adventure, Beasts of Fire, Hooligan Hustle, and more.</p>
<p>Play’n Go’s company profile has been reinforced over the years by player-favorite games such as Book of Dead, Reactoonz, Fire Joker, and others that have established themselves as leading titles in each targeted market.</p>
<p>Partners Happy with Their Italian Focus</p>
<p>NetBet Italy PR manager Claudia Georgevici commented on the partnership and praised it as a well-thought-through move:</p>
<p>“Play’n Go is a favorite among our players, and we’re delighted to continue our offering of their products to all our loyal customers. The inclusion of this provider helps us in our commitment to delivering the best online casino experience that we’re known for.” NetBet Italy PR manager Claudia Georgevici</p>
<p>Play’n GO head of sales Luisa Allegro welcomed the partnership and said that signing this new deal would allow more players to experience the company’s products. Allegro did mention the dynamic payways category, which is a particular point of pride for the company, and added:</p>
<p>“And with more innovative Dynamic Payways titles on our roadmap, that should do well in Italy too, and we can’t wait to get started with NetBet, and expect that this is just the start of a long and fruitful relationship.” Play’n GO head of sales Luisa Allegro</p>
<p>Play’n GO expects its products to strike home with NetBet gaming audiences in the Italian market. While Italy experienced some strong restrictions of its iGaming market over the past year, this has not stopped new companies from diving headfirst and establishing a firm foothold in the jurisdiction.</p>
