<p>DraftKings releases mobile sports betting app for WV</p>
<p>This is the second app to arrive on the market after FanDuel‚Äôs</p>
<p>DraftKings teams up with NetEnt for a New Jersey partnership</p>
<p>DraftKings has become the second operator in West Virginia to launch a mobile sports betting app, following an earlier release by FanDuel this week.</p>
<p>DraftKings Launches WV Second Mobile App</p>
<p>Daily fantasy sports betting provider DraftKings has launched its dedicated mobile sportsbook in West Virginia and pushed for an expansion of its efforts back in New Jersey, where the company struck a partnership with NetEnt.</p>
<p>As a result, NetEnt will be in charge of providing more iGaming products to DraftKings‚Äô efforts to establish footprint in a new vertical. Back to West Virginia, all sports betting fans will now be able to use a native sportsbook app on mobile or simply head to the browser version and make a wager.</p>
<p>DraftKings provides both daily fantasy as well as regular sports betting odds, and as a result, users will be allowed to switch between the two verticals as they see fit. The operator has pooled its efforts with Penn National Gaming, the land-based operator which has made it possible for DraftKings to expand for mobile. A partnership between the two companies was previously struck in December.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, DraftKings‚Äô co-founder and chief revenue officer Matt Kalish had the following to say regarding the situation:</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are thrilled to continue our DraftKings Sportsbook expansion by getting our product into the hands of West Virginians.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Kalish further added that DraftKings was excited to be able to provide fans with specific and generous options. It has always been the company‚Äôs mission to try and broaden its selection of betting options, odds and rewards in West Virginia, he added.</p>
<p>Mobile Grows in WV and Beyond</p>
<p>DraftKings‚Äô mobile option in WV is the second to arrive after Flutter Entertainment-owned competitor, FanDuel went ahead with a launch on its own on Monday.</p>
<p>ICYMI, we are now LIVE in the great state of West Virginia, thanks in part to our friends at @The_Greenbrier üí∞</p>

<p>Originally, DraftKings hoped to beat FanDuel by obtaining an early entry into the market, but their plans crumbled. A launch scheduled for June, 2019 never got the approval of the West Virginia Lottery Commission, which was concerned about the physical location of the company‚Äôs servers.</p>
<p>This was occasioned by an ongoing fight with the Department of Justice and specifically the latest Wire Act Opinion which could lead to legal prosecution against parties transferring data across state borders. The Wire Act is not quite yet defeated, although the U.S. Congress stated that it would not spend any money on funding potential legal action by DOJ.</p>
<p>With all of this afoot, DraftKings didn‚Äôt miss to enhance its iGaming offer back in New Jersey, adding NetEnt to its catalog of gaming products. NetEnt‚Äôs managing director for America, Erik Nyman, promised that players in New Jersey could look forward a number of exciting game releases before 2019 is out.</p>
<p>Mr. Nyman also expressed his company‚Äôs satisfaction to have partnered with a company that has such a large player base, acknowledging the opportunities ahead of NetEnt.</p>
