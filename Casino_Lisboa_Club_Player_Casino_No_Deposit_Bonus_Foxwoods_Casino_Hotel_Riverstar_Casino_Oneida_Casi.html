<p>The agreement will see the two parties share information about suspicious betting activity identified during Swedish sporting events</p>
<p>The Swedish Gambling Authority (Spelinspektionen, SGA) has joined forces with the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on sports betting integrity.</p>
<p>Under the MoU, the Swedish regulator will work with the largest international betting integrity monitor in the world, allowing it to better prevent fraud. The agreement will see the two parties share information about suspicious betting activity identified during Swedish sporting events.</p>
<p>The IBIA represents the majority of Sweden’s licensed betting market. For reference, experts valued Sweden’s sports betting market at SEK4,690 million (roughly $450 million) in sports betting GGR in 2022.</p>
<p>The current MoU follows the Swedish Government’s recent decision to amend the Gambling Ordinance and align Sweden with the Macolin Convention. As a result, the Spelinspektionen will set up and run a platform for itself, licensed betting operators and national sports federations to share information regarding suspected match-fixing cases.</p>
<p>The Partnership Will Protect Swedish Sports from Fraud</p>
<p>Camilla Rosenberg, the Spelinspektionen’s director-general, commented on the MoU saying that information sharing is very important to the integrity of sports. Because of that, her team is delighted to have signed this memorandum.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are delighted to have reached this agreement with IBIA which will be beneficial to our coordination of the national platform and general work against match-fixing. We look forward to our cooperation with IBIA. Camilla Rosenberg, direct-general, Spelinspektionen</p>
<p>IBIA’s chief executive officer, Khalid Ali, also commented on the matter, saying that his team is delighted to have reached an agreement with the Swedish regulator. He said that his association vows to work closely with the SGA to maintain the integrity of Swedish sports and Sweden’s regulated sports betting market.</p>
<p>IBIA will utilize its global customer account transaction data to identify and report suspicious betting on Swedish sporting events to the SGA and engage in any related investigatory actions. Maintaining the integrity of the market is of paramount importance. Khalid Ali, CEO, IBIA</p>
<p>For reference, the IBIA is an international non-profit organization that seeks to protect the integrity of the sports betting sector. Its member list includes almost 50 companies and over 125 sports betting brands whose collective annual betting turnover exceeds $137 billion.</p>
<p>Last year, the IBIA also joined forces with the data security specialist IXUP to strengthen its capacities and explore products and services that can improve the integrity of the US sports betting market.</p>
