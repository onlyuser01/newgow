<p>The mentor solution is based on 15+ years of academic research by Dr Michael Auer, Neccton’s director and head of development</p>
<p>Intouch Games, a Skywind Group-owned operator &amp; platform provider, has secured an agreement with Neccton, a leading provider of responsible gambling and anti-money laundering software. The agreement will expand the latter company’s presence in Europe while protecting the operator’s business from fraud.</p>
<p>The products that Intouch will receive will protect both the company itself and its customers. It will benefit from Neccton’s mentor solution, which provides AI-driven real-time data analysis. Thanks to this, the operator will be able to identify gambling harm and react quickly.</p>
<p>The mentor tool is designed to recognize various early signs of gambling harm, helping operators intervene on time and protect their customers. The tool can spot a variety of triggers, such as an increase in deposit frequency, spending, etc. The solution directly warns the player while alerting the operator, allowing it to provide further intervention.</p>
<p>Neccton’s mentor solution also boasts modules for fraud, AML and CRM, making it a one-stop shop for operators wishing to protect both their business and their customers. Intouch Games will therefore be able to stay ahead of its competitors in terms of player protection and compliance.</p>
<p>Mentor Is Based on Years of Research</p>
<p>The provider’s software solutions are based on 15+ years of academic research by Dr Michael Auer, Neccton’s director and head of development. He is a much respected academic when it comes to responsible gambling, with his research being cited by many regulatory bodies. Mentor is Auer’s magnum opus because of its reliability and proven efficiency.</p>
<p>Dr Auer himself commented on the agreement with Intouch Games, welcoming it to the Neccton family and saying that he is excited to supply the brand with the mentor solution. Auer noted that the agreement will allow the operator to differentiate itself from its competitors.</p>
<p>Working with us means they are ahead of the curve with player protection, and what operator would not want that? We are looking forward to a great partnership with Intouch Games – and even more UK players protected with our software. Dr Michael Auer, director &amp; head of development, Neccton</p>
<p>Intouch Games’ director Hilary Stewart-Jones also commented on the matter, noting that her team deeply respects Dr Auer and his amazing work.</p>
<p>We all hugely respect Dr. Auer’s work in this critical field and look forward to many years of collaboration in raising the bar of the RG industry norms. Hilary Stewart-Jones, director, Intouch Games</p>
<p>In February, Neccton’s mentor solution was also implemented into Betsafe following an agreement with the gambling giant Betsson.</p>
