<p>Supplier of technology, content and services for the online casino gaming industry EveryMatrix announced an agreement with the National Lottery of Malta to provide online games for the operator.</p>
<p>Highest Service Standards</p>
<p>EveryMatrix signed an agreement with National Lottery plc, a subsidiary of Malta-based IZI Group, to supply the country’s national lottery operator with its online casino game titles.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, Franco DeGabriele, chief commercial officer at National Lottery plc emphasized the historical moment that will see the National Lottery of Malta being operated by a local entity for the first time since the lottery’s privatization 18 years ago, adamant that National Lottery would live up to expectations to “provide the market with a service that is local, innovative and of the highest levels of quality.”</p>
<p>“We will invest in the systems to ensure the service offered meets the highest standards and is built on the most rigorous compliance frameworks. Our digital innovation will put Malta on the global map, and we will work closely with the authorities to eradicate all forms of lottery abuse.” Franco DeGabriele, CCO, National Lottery</p>
<p>The agreement with EveryMatrix will make all of the National Lottery of Malta’s draw-based games available online and accessible by both desktop and mobile devices, via integration with IGT, the National Lottery’s company of choice to supply the lottery technology.</p>
<p>Player Engagement Opportunities</p>
<p>Delighted with the partnership with National Lottery, EveryMatrix Group CEO Ebbe Groes outlined how the company’s system will help the lottery operator engage with its local customers.</p>
<p>“We believe the benefits delivered by our system will enable the national lottery to safely channel Maltese players away from illegal or abusive secondary lotteries.” Ebbe Groes, Group CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>“The integration of the world’s no. 1 lottery system provider speaks volumes about the performance of our platform,” Groes concluded.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix will provide the lottery operator with its suite of online games and will integrate IGT’s retail transaction engine into its CasinoEngine solution, the iGaming Integration Platform via IGT’s Aurora Everywhere.</p>
<p>Established in 2004, IZI Group placed its strategic focus on land-based gaming and quickly grew into a market leader across all gaming segments, including casino, retail sports betting, video lottery, and bingo, driven by its desire to innovate and provide fair and responsible gaming.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix and IGT signed a patent license deal in May which allowed the casino content supplier to distribute games that incorporate IGT’s proprietary game features, including those patented by IGT’s licensing program members.</p>
