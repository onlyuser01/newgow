<p>Games Global has set a new record for online progressive jackpot payout eclipsing other popular titles such as Mega Moolah and Divine Fortune and getting to the very top of the pecking order. The company’s own progressive title, WowPot!, has just paid a massive €38.4m jackpot that will turn a few heads, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>The WowPot! Jackpot was hit on Wheel of Wishes on December 20, 2023, and it has doubled the previous biggest number to ever have been hit on a progressive jackpot game – €19.4m won exactly at Mega Moolah. Well, Microgaming’s title is not the only coveted jackpot experience in town any more as WowPot! is definitely going to be more popular after the win.</p>
<p>The game has been played by more than 5.3m people worldwide and it has paid out a total of €225m with the recent win accounting for a hefty bulk of the total. The WowPot! Progressive jackpot has been implemented across many games and portfolios, including 9 Blazing Diamonds WowPot!, Triple Edge Studios, Neon Valley Studio’s Queen of Alexandria WowPot!, and so many more.</p>
<p>Naturally, Games Global, Chief Product Officer Andy Booth, was very happy to see Games Global achieve this milestone and establish its name in the industry.</p>
<p>"We would also like to extend our congratulations to the winner of this celebration. Now that it has been won, our job is to reset it and go again, hopefully making another record-breaking jackpot in the process," Booth added.</p>
<p>The progressive jackpot has already been hit on several occasions before, with Games Global reporting wins as big as €17.5m off a single instance in the previous year. The four-tier WowPot! the jackpot has been around for a while now, bringing various opportunities for players who are looking to have a blast playing their favorite games and still stand a chance to win a mighty jackpot indeed.</p>
<p>Wheel of Wishes, the game that has been awarded the jackpot, was created by Alchemy Gaming, a Games Global studio, and was originally launched in 2020. Although WowPot! took some time to take off, the feature has been very popular, and it has driven the Wheel of Wishes brand as well.</p>
<p>Alchemy Gaming Head of Studio Rory Harpur too spoke about the new milestone by the company and hailed the opportunity to see Wheel of Wishes grab headlines and make such a significant impact.</p>
<p>"A truly historic day for the Alchemy team, for our partners at Games Global, and in the wider industry," Harpur said. Previously, Games Global introduced its live casino games with Betsson Group.</p>
