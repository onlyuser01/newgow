<p>Supplier of B2B solutions to the online gaming industry EveryMatrix announced the official launch of its Managed Services unit established earlier this year.</p>
<p>‘Another Important Milestone’</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s Managed Services team was established to provide 360° support to the executive teams of the company’s B2B clients, supporting their actions from acquisition and retention marketing to product management and payment solutions to help them improve their brand performance and capitalize on opportunities.</p>
<p>Our company is constantly evolving and developing, and with the addition of the Managed Services solution, we reached another important milestone. I am sure Tom Dyson will do a great job leading the talented and brilliant team responsible for this project.” Stian Hornsletten, Chief Commercial Officer and Co-Founder, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Led by Tom Dyson, a recognized gaming industry professional with extensive knowledge of the industry and experience in leading teams for companies like Gambling Compliance, ProgressPlay and Gaming Realms, the Managed Services unit offers an outsourced option for online casino or sports betting operations. It provides expertise in areas like marketing, affiliate, CRM &amp; VIP, product management, payments and fraud, bonus abuse monitoring and customer support.</p>
<p>Cost Optimization Is Key</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement of the Managed Services official launch, head of unit Tom Dyson pointed marketing as one of the activities that bear the largest costs in online gaming businesses, stressing the importance for every iGaming operator to optimize its marketing spend to be able to “achieve growth in one of the most competitive corners of the internet.”</p>
<p>Because of this, and the labyrinth of regulatory challenges presented to the modern operator, many traditional marketing agencies struggle to make the most of their client’s budgets. Our new team can solve this problem by combining our industry experience and unrivaled product expertise but most importantly through a shared measure of success with our clients.” Tom Dyson, Head, Managed Services, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s modular and API-driven products for online casino, sports betting, payments and affiliate management can either work together as an entire platform or independently. Designed to help its clients deliver an outstanding experience to their customers, EveryMatrix’s solutions offer easy integration with existing platforms of bookmakers, lottery operators and others, operating on different business scales.</p>
<p>In July, EveryMatrix became an associate member of one of the largest member groups in the global gaming industry, the World Lottery Association.</p>
<p>The company is also a member of the European Lotteries Association and iDevelopment and Economic Association (iDEA), the voice of the online gaming industry in the US.</p>
