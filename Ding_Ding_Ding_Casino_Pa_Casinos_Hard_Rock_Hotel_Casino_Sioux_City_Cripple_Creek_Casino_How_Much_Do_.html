<p>Not long after launching a new baccarat offering, Gaming Corps, a Swedish supplier and developer of gaming content, announced that it has secured approval to launch in Latvia. Now that it has been greenlit by the Lotteries and Gambling Supervisory Inspection, the company will be able to offer its casino games to local players.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps is a very experienced developer that is experienced in creating exciting video games and iGaming content. It boasts a rich library of titles, which will now become available to operators in Latvia and their players.</p>
<p>Gambling companies that integrate Gaming Corps content into their platforms will be able to engage consumers with hit crash, mine, table and slot games, as well as Plinko. Some of the company’s best games include titles such as Coin Miner, Jet Lucky 2, Penalty Champion and Raging Zeus.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps Is Delighted to Launch in Latvia</p>
<p>Gaming Corps’ chief executive officer, Juha Kauppinen, commented on the new license, expressing his excitement to expand his company’s presence. He said that Gaming Corps is delighted by the opportunity to offer its great casino games to players in Latvia. Kauppinen added that the developer will continue pursuing further growth opportunities in regulated markets.</p>
<p>The CEO noted that his company is now famous for its rounded portfolio of games, which caters to the needs of many operators and suits the tastes of many players. He promised to continue creating localized experiences for gamblers while expanding Gaming Corps’ footprint through strategic deals.</p>
<p>We have built a reputation for offering a rounded portfolio of games which cater for all our active markets, supporting our customers with the best content for localized player references. We will continue to do this in what is an exciting period of expansion for us, and I look forward to welcoming more partners to the Gaming Corps family. Juha Kauppinen, CEO, Gaming Corps</p>
<p>The Company Has a Strong Presence in Europe</p>
<p>The foray into Latvia is the latest in a string of market launches and follows successful launches in the Netherlands and Spain. In addition, the company recently secured the new B2B license in Sweden.</p>
<p>For reference, Sweden recently decided to regulate B2B companies and will require suppliers to secure a license before operating in the country.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gaming Corps’ content is available in a number of other markets, including Malta, Portugal, Romania, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Estonia.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Gaming Corps also minted a partnership agreement with QTech, injecting content into the latter company’s aggregation platform.</p>
