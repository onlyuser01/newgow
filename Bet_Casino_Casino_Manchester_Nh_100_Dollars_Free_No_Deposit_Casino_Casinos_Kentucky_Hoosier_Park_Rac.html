<p>VSiN is bringing more broadcasting talent to expand its programming scope, debut new shows, and provide more quality sports betting content and analyses to US sports fans.</p>
<p>Vegas Stats and Information Network Grows Media Team</p>
<p>VSiN, the Las Vegas sports media network, is expanding its reach with bringing more broadcasting talent to increase the programming scope and cover more events. Specifically, the Vegas Stats and Information Network, or VSiN for short, will try to expand into sports betting audiences and bring the numbers up following the moribund pandemic season and tapping into pent-up demand.</p>
<p>VSiN’s focus lies solely and entirely with sports betting, and it was the first media network, starting in 2017, to make the shift towards sports betting coverage at a time when the status of PASPA was still undecided.</p>
<p>Taking a preemptive move has allowed VSiN to embed itself in the national consciousness and appeal to sports fans and bettors. Part of its success has been the addition of Tim Murray whom the network hired in 2019.</p>
<p>With the addition of fresh broadcasting talent, the 24/7 network can now expand to over 100 live linear hours during the weekend and provide you with all the sports betting action you may be looking forward to.</p>
<p>Here is what VSiN founder and CEO Brian Musburger had to say in an official statement on the occasion of growing the network’s casting talent:</p>
<p>“VSiN has experienced incredible growth over the past 18 months, significantly expanding distribution, advertising sales, and industry partnerships, while enhancing our product across channels.</p>
<p>We’re excited to build on that momentum by launching new shows and introducing new talent,” Musburger said. “This new programming will allow us to cover sportsbooks around the country and provide unique and valuable insights to our growing audience of sports bettors.”</p>
<p>New Shows Coming in the Weeks Ahead</p>
<p>With collegiate sports looking at an uncertain future for the 2020/2021 season, VSiN is feeling confident that it would be able to capitalize on sports in 2020. Even though events have been fewer this year, due to the lockdown, sports betting went up by 10.4% in H1, 2020.</p>
<p>You can place a legal bet in 18 states with at least 10 more in an advanced stage of passing online betting legislation. Meanwhile, Musburger has confirmed that the network plans on launching several other shows in the near future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, VSiN is looking forward to opening a second studio, which is currently developed at the site of the Circa Resort Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The property is due to open in October. Meanwhile, the company also provided the names of the actual anchors that are coming to bolster the company’s efforts, including Murray, Mike Pitchard, who is a sports broadcaster, James Salinas who covers sports as a journalist and Danielle Alvari who worked at the NFL Network.</p>
<p>There will be a range of shows that VSiN is going to be pushing, including Betting Across America, THE Pre-game Show and My Guys in the Desert. In each case, the network will focus on providing bettors with credible and actionable advice to turn their wagers into a success.</p>
<p>All new faces on the team have experience in running comprehensive and entertaining sports betting products that provide bettors with the necessary insight to be better informed.</p>
<p>As part of the Betting Across America show, VSiN has teamed up with BetMGM and will invite the sportsbook’s oddsmaker to discuss the latest moves in the sport in focus and issue advice. The show will be broadcast live from BetMGM venues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BetMGM has been signing a number of high-profile partnerships, teaming up with the PGA Tour and NASCAR, to name just a few.</p>
