<p>The world’s leading sports technology company, Sportradar, announced the launch of a refreshed OTT subscription service called NHL.TV, just in time for the 2022-23 National Hockey League (NHL) season.</p>
<p>Sportradar Backs Revamped NHL.TV Solution</p>
<p>The announcement came Monday and sees a refreshed OTT subscription service launched by the NHL in collaboration with Sportradar. The refreshed solution will cater to clients outside Canada and the US and offer unrivaled experiences for live and on-demand NHL games for sports fans. The refreshed NHL.TV subscription service is powered by Sportadar’s leading solutions that “help the NHL manage the end-to-end workflow,” the company explained.</p>
<p>Those solutions include Sportradar’s leading OTT frontend applications, OTT backend applications, as well as UX/UI design. At the same time, the company will help with third-party integrations for the refreshed platform. As a result of the new launch, the refreshed solution is now available to sports fans in more than 120 different jurisdictions around the world. Besides live game streaming, the revamped solution offers unique personalization features such as highlights and on-demand videos. According to Sportradar, the refreshed NHL.TV solution will be available for TVs with Android, Fire TV but will also be supported by Foxxum Operating System.</p>
<p>The recent collaboration builds upon a strong foundation. Last summer, in June, Sportradar linked a groundbreaking agreement with the NHL, designating the company as the League’s Official Betting Data Rights, Official Media Data Rights and Official Betting Streaming Rights partner. This enabled the operator to distribute NHL official data, as well as statistics to sports betting, media and technology companies around the world. In addition, Sportradar was named the Official Integrity Partner of the NHL. This helped boost the integrity of the sport while Sportradar vowed to monitor global betting activities for NHL competitions.</p>
<p>NHL.TV to Bring Unique Experiences for Sports Fans</p>
<p>Stephen McArdle, NHL’s senior executive vice president, digital media and strategic planning, revealed that NHL sports fans around the world are just as excited about technology and entertaining experiences as the fan base of the League in North America. He added that the newly refreshed NHL.TV available for international markets will bring personalized and enhanced gaming experiences for sports fans. Last but not least, McArdle said that the NHL is looking forward to continuing its already strong collaboration with Sportradar and delivering more excitement for customers of the OTT solution.</p>
<p>“Today’s sports fans expect a viewing experience that is highly personalized and tailored to their unique interests.“ Ed Blonk, chief commercial officer at Sportradar</p>
<p>According to Sportradar’s chief commercial officer, Ed Blonk, currently, sports fans are interested in engaging and personalized viewing experiences. He explained that leveraging technology that has been developed for years enabled the company to deliver the revamped NHL.TV, which “has the ability to meet and exceed viewer demands.” Finally, Blonk said that Sportradar will continue its engaging B2B partnership with NHL and continue to deliver products that boost fan engagement.</p>
