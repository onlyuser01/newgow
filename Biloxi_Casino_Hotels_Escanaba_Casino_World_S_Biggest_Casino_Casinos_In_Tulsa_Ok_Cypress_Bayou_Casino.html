<p>Sightline Payments, a provider of cashless payment solutions, has strengthened its team with four new promotions. The company picked four loyal employees and provided them with leadership roles.</p>
<p>The four employees that Sightline opted to promote are Felicia Gassen, Kathleen Duffy, Katie Kuthe and Rose Zwirn. Each one of them has served the company for over a year and has helped Sightline grow and evolve. Now, the four employees will have opportunities to grow professionally and help the company open a new chapter.</p>
<p>Omer Sattar, one of Sightline Payments’ co-CEOs, said he is happy to announce the promotions. He noted that the four women are all extremely talented, energized, enthusiastic and detail-oriented doers. Sattar noted that those are all the qualities Sightline expects from its workers.</p>
<p>Felicia Gassen – Chief Administrative Officer</p>
<p>Felicia Gassen joined Sightline’s team back in 2021. She began her time with the company as its chief of staff and used her experience to guide Sightline’s personnel. A former executive director at Global Gaming Women, Gassen is an experienced worker who quickly found her way around. As a result, she has now been named as Sightline Payments’ chief administrative officer.</p>
<p>Commenting on her promotion, Gassen said that she is thankful to the CEOs, Omer Sattar and Joseph Pappano, for the opportunity they have given her. She added that she is happy to be surrounded by “such brilliant colleagues.”</p>
<p>Kathleen Duffy – VP PMO</p>
<p>Kathleen Duffy, on the other hand, is a former Aristocrat, Caesars and Las Vegas Sands worker. As such, she boasts years of experience in the sector and has extensive knowledge of the gambling ecosystem.</p>
<p>Duffy joined the payment solutions provider in 2020 and worked as director of its IT Project Management Office. Sightline was happy with the veteran’s performance and has now rewarded her by promoting her to senior VP of its Project and Release Management Office.</p>
<p>Katie Kuthe – VP of Client Solutions Delivery</p>
<p>Katie Kuthe is the most loyal Sightline worker of the bunch. She joined the company in 2014 and has worked with its team for almost a decade. Kuthe served as a director of product deployment but has now been named as the company’s vice president of client solutions delivery.</p>
<p>She will be responsible for ensuring Sightline’s clients are happy with the company’s products and solutions.</p>
<p>Rose Zwirn – Vice President of Business Development</p>
<p>Rose Zwirn is an experienced account management worker who joined Sightline in 2019. Prior to that, she worked as a senior account manager at Blackhawk Network and has years of experience in the field.</p>
<p>Sightline promoted Zwirn to senior vice president of business development and trusted her with managing the company’s growing business.</p>
