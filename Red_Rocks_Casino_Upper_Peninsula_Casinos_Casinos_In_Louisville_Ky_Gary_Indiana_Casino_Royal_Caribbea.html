<p>Betway continues its expansion on the Eastern European market as it launches Betway.bg in Bulgaria. The news was announced by the sportsbook on Monday and it was distributed to Bulgarian media and Betway’s affiliate marketing partners.</p>
<p>Bulgaria’s National Revenue Agency Issued the License to Betway</p>
<p>The launch of the UK-based sportsbook in Bulgaria marks the 12th jurisdiction in Europe where Betway will operate. The group has B2C licenses in Germany, Portugal, Denmark, Malta, the UK, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Sweden, Ireland, and France. As for other territories outside of Europe, Betway is also making significant efforts in Ghana.</p>
<p>Bulgaria’s National Revenue Agency oversees online and land-based gambling activities and reports to the country’s Ministry of Finance. This regulator issued the market license to Betway and with it, Betway’s plans of expanding in Eastern Europe have started.</p>
<p>Originally, the sportsbook was given a license in Poland, but it still hasn’t launched its services there due to the fact that its parent company – Super Group, was focused on a SPAC merger with Sports Entertainment Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>As a way to make sure that Bulgaria’s Gambling Act is in compliance with EEA business law, Bulgarian authorities decided to updated provisions of the law. Betway’s launch in the country proved to be a massive success as locals can wager on numerous sports: soccer, tennis, basketball, e-sports, etc. All of the bonus offers from the sportsbook are also up for grabs.</p>
<p>Betway Partnered with Simplebet to Deliver Products in 5 US States</p>
<p>Betway is also making sure that it does not lose any focus on the US market. After all, US online sports betting and online gambling in general, is facing huge expansion and every operator wants a piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Most recently, Simplebet and Betway announced a partnership through which Simplebet will be able to deliver its products via Betway’s platform in 5 US states: Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Jersey, Colorado, and Indiana.</p>
<p>Anthony Werkman, the CEO of Betway, stated that as the company continues to grow on the US market, it is vital for it to provide the best experience for its customers and that is exactly what it plans to do by partnering with Simplebet.</p>
<p>Simplebet’s CEO and co-founder, Chris Bevilacqua, also shared his excitement. He said that everyone at Simplebet is excited to have the company’s micro-betting products on a platform as big as Betway’s. The news was announced just before the Super Bowl, the biggest event in the US sports calendar.</p>
<p>Enhanced customer experience is also the reason why Betway signed an expansion deal with Genius Sports back in January. With the expanded deal, Genius Sports will provide Betway with its LiveData and LiveTrading solutions.</p>
