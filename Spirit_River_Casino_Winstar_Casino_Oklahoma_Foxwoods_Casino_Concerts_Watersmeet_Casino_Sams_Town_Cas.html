    <h1>Spirit River Casino Winstar Casino Oklahoma Foxwoods Casino Concerts Watersmeet Casino Sams Town Cas</h1>

<p>hi first of all, and although i have a player account with hyperino and recently around. 12000-14000euro won. This sum resulted at the end of several games, the exact amount I cannot say because Hyperino has blocked my player account at the moment so that I have no access. In any case, my current balance is between 12000-14000 euros. Now I wanted to Cash out 1800 euros and see that only my friend's account number is visible to where the money can be transferred, although when I opened my player account I entered my own Postbank account and also confirmed it with a 4-digit pin at hyperino. Now I had previously 2 or 3 times via Klarna, my girlfriend deposited her current account into my player account with 10 euros each time, so I assume that hyperino has recognized it as a verification through my girlfriend's online deposit. But then I ask myself why do I have a 4-digit pin got sent to my own Postbank current account because I could see my account statement via Postbank and through d When I entered my 4-digit pin at hyperino, my player account was verified. When I tried to withdraw 1800 euros, I happened to see the option [add another account], and I clicked on it and added my postbank account details again. I then tried Pay out 1,800 euros to my friend's account and 1,800 euros to my own Postbank account. I should then submit my girlfriend's documents to hyperino, such as an identity card, a bank card scanned from both sides and an account statement not older than 3 months, where it should be my girlfriend's address can be clearly read. the same documents were asked of me. i submitted everything as requested by my friend and me. but now i had not submitted an ID card, but only a valid temporary ID card from myself. i got it an e-mail from Hyperino that provisional identity cards are not recognized and the processing of the payment can only be processed further as soon as the final ID card is submitted. I had applied for this and submitted it to Hyperino after more than 2 weeks. Now every time Hyperino says I should be patient and it is in the examination again and again hold off and put off, that's why I ask you for help.</p>
