    <h1>Wow Vegas Casino Casino 1995 Movie Redstag Casino Ts Casino Agua Caliente Casino NineCasino Player f</h1>

<p>Dear Caniggia2021,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. First, I’d like to explain to you what the difference is between closing the account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can reopen the account anytime, and the casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances (after the cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who are addicted/with a gambling problem).</p>
<p>I have checked the Terms and Conditions of NineCasino, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>10.CLOSING OF THE ACCOUNT</p>
<p>Users may close their User account by contacting Us via support@ninecasino.com. Ninecasino shall return to You any and all funds from the User Account. The method of repayment will be chosen at the absolute discretion of the Company. In order to ensure anti-fraud measures, prevention of laundering proceeds of crime and financing of terrorism and abuse on the part of the User, Ninecasino reserves the right to verify User’s identity in the process of closing User’s account. It means that Ninecasino is entitled to request up-to-date documents from the Users, conduct an interview (Skype call or Zoom call) with a User, request confirmation of source of funds or/and a high-resolution and visible photo of a user’s selfie with his/her up-to date documents near his/her face, even though the User have passed identity verification in the past. Company reserves the right to close your User Account and to refund to you funds from the balance of the User Account, subject to the deduction of relevant withdrawal charges, at NineCompany's absolute discretion and without any obligation to state a reason or give prior notice.</p>
<p>Could you please specify the reason for closing your account? Would you be so kind as to forward me the account closure requests that you sent to the casino? My email address is veronika.l@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
