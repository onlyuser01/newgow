<p>Foxwoods Casino is restarting the Grand Theater, its biggest indoor entertainment venue, setting it at 25% operational capacity.</p>
<p>Biggest Indoors Entertainment Venue Restarts at Foxwoods Casino</p>
<p>The show will go on at Connecticut’s Foxwoods Casino which reopened its largest indoor entertainment venue setting it at 25% operational capacity. The Grand Theater is now part of Phase 3 of the state’s reopening plan, and the casino feels confident in bringing back entertainment, following in the example of Las Vegas casinos.</p>
<p>Commenting on the pending restart, Foxwoods Casino VP of Entertainment and Marketing, Monique Sebastian, the casino has been planning to continue, indoor performances for the past four months. She specifically had this to say:</p>
<p>“We have been intricately planning how to safely resume live, indoor entertainment for over four months, which resulted in a thoughtful and slow process to ensure we rebuilt the right infrastructure in our theatres.” -Foxwoods Casino VP of Entertainment and Marketing, Monique Sebastian</p>
<p>Reopening the venue sends a strong signal to the state which was one of the most heavily impacted at the onset of the pandemic, but has managed to adapt despite a growing number of infections since the mid-March lockdown was introduced.</p>
<p>Foxwood Resorts successfully restarted operations earlier this year on June 1 but had not been able to reintroduce its entertainment facilities to the extent it wanted to due to strong opposition from Gov. Ned Lamont.</p>
<p>He finally acquiesced to the restart of operations at outdoor event venues and indoor spaces, but up to pre-agreed 50% capacity limit in early October.</p>
<p>Every County to Decide whether to Scale to Phase 2 for Itself</p>
<p>The governor is responding to the toughest recessions Connecticut has seen in its recent history, but also finally has the data to allow the reopening of the activities in question.</p>
<p>While cases have begun rising again during Phase 3 of the state’s reopening initiative, Gov. Lamont has decided to pursue a different path and allow each county to introduce rollbacks as they see fit based on the numbers cited in each. Calls for a rollback to Phase 2 have been wide-spread, though.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Foxwood Resorts is preparing to welcome a number of entertainers, including Almost Queen on November 5 along with Anthony Rodia, Bob Marley, Jerry Seinfield and Vic DiBitetto all making an appearance by the end of 2020.</p>
