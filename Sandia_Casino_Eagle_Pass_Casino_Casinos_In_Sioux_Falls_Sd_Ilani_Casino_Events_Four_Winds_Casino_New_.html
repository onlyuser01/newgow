<p>Kansas City Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes Might be the Best QB in 2022</p>
<p>When WR Tyreek Hill moved to the Miami Dolphins, there were fears that the Chiefs’ passing game was going to suffer. However, after two weeks of the 2022 NFL season, they already got six passing touchdowns.</p>
<p>The main reason why they’ve been great in passing is that they got Patrick Mahomes as their QB. The man is sitting in the no.1 position in terms of passer rating (127.9), with a total of 595 passing yards and seven touchdowns. Further, Mahomes remains without a single interception.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mahomes’ output, the Chiefs have scored a total of 71 points in two games. They’ve conceded 45 points so far, which isn’t great, but the fact is that they’ve played against offensive-minded teams in the first two weeks of the season – the Arizona Cardinals and the Los Angeles Chargers.</p>
<p>Things Aren’t Looking Great for the Indianapolis Colts</p>
<p>The Colts are 0-1-1 in 2022, even though they were favored to win both of their games. In Week 1, they were strong favorites against the Houston Texans, but the underdogs managed to cause an upset and get a tie.</p>
<p>In Week 2, the Colts’ performance was even more embarrassing. They got blown out by the Jacksonville Jaguars, who entered the games as underdogs. The final score was 24-0 for the Jags, who outplayed the Colts in all aspects of the game.</p>
<p>The Colts offense was shut out by the Jaguars defense, who kept QB Matt Ryan to 16/30 for 195 yards, no touchdowns, and three interceptions. The Jags defense also managed to keep the 2021 rushing yards leader Jonathan Taylor at bay. He recorded only 54 yards that evening.</p>
<p>The Colts defense also had a nightmare evening, conceding 24 points in total. The reason why this needs to worry them a lot is that they conceded so many points against a team led by former Chiefs offensive coordinator, Doug Pederson. If they were unable to stop the Jags, imagine what the Chiefs are going to do to them in Week 3!</p>
<p>Chiefs vs Colts Predictions</p>
<p>The Chiefs are going to rip the Colts apart on Sunday. We think Mahomes is going to continue playing great, while Kansas’ defense has a chance to improve its stats and keep the Colts to under 20 points.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs to win and cover the spread; under 49.5 to hit</p>
