<p>Tiger Woods On Five Year Tournament Slump, But Still Betting Favorite at Quicken Loans National</p>

<p>Tiger Woods hasn’t won a PGA Tour event in nearly half of a decade, but heading into this week’s Quicken Loans National at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm, he still has the second-shorts odds of winning among the 120-player field.</p>

<p>Rickie Fowler (7/1) is the favorite at the Westgate SuperBook. He’s followed by Woods at 12/1.</p>
<p>After Fowler and Woods, Francesco Molinari and Marc Leishman are next at 16/1. Kyle Stanley rounds out the top five at 20/1.</p>
<p>Fowler has nine top-10 finishes in 14 starts this year. He additionally won the Hero World Challenge, an unofficial PGA Tour event last December that also benefits Woods’ foundation.</p>
<p>The short odds on Woods and Fowler are due to a relatively weak Quicken Loans field. That’s a result of many star players venturing to France for the HNA Open. Players there include Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, and Sergio Garcia.</p>
<p>Tiger is the tournament host this week outside DC, with the PGA Tour event benefiting the Tiger Woods Foundation. He’s won the event two times in its 10-year history.</p>
<p>Value Players</p>
<p>Although he hasn’t won since 2003, sports bettors routinely bet on Woods to win each time the 79-time PGA Tour winner tees it up. Tiger said in March his continued short odds are due to “a lot of gamble-oholics out there.”</p>
<p>In the 2018 wraparound season, Woods has made the cut in eight of the 10 tournaments he’s played. He’s finished in the top-25 six times, and has two top-10s. He’s amassed earnings of $1.5 million, and currently stands 61st in the FedEx Cup rankings.</p>
<p>Better Play, Longer Odds Kyle Stanley (20/1), the Quicken Loans National defending champion, has 10 top-25 and four top-10 finishes in 2018, and has won over $2.3 million. He’s 34th in the FedEx Cup. Gary Woodland (40/1) has two top-10 finishes, plus a win at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, and sits in 33rd on the points list. Stewart Cink (40/1) is coming off a T2 finish at last week’s Travelers Championship, which included a final round 62. His previous tournament was a T4 finish at the FedEx St. Jude Classic.</p>
<p>A $100 bet on Woods nets $1,200. The gambler who makes the same wager on Stanley would pocket $800 more at $2,000. A bet on Woodland or Cink would return $4,000 should they be the victor on Sunday.</p>
<p>Wooed by Woods</p>
<p>Nevada and online sportsbooks have benefited from Woods’ game finding respectability. Interest and golf handle skyrocket when Tiger is inside the ropes.</p>
<p>The key for oddsmakers is to have Tiger play well enough to spur bets throughout the four days, but then not win. He’s done a lot of that recently.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers additionally serve up numerous prop bets to increase handle. For this week, the SuperBook asks if Woods will make the cut (Yes -700, No +500), if he’ll finish in the top-10 (Yes +150, No -180), and whether he’ll conclude the tournament in the top-20 (Yes -150, No +130).</p>
<p>With The Open Championship less than a month out, Woods is at 25/1. Dustin Johnson is the favorite at 12/1.</p>
