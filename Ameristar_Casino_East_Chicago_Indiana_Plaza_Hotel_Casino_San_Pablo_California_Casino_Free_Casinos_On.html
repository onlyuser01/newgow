<p>Hyper Burst review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>With a Polynesian-flavour, this slot is full of volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>The game is set in an island jungle, with wins taking the form of flowing lava. Players will be faced with an array of mysterious masks and etched letters. Like any adventurer, they will face the quest head on.</p>
<p>The references to Polynesian culture definitely feel more like a resort performance than an authentic portrayal. However, the colourful atmosphere keeps things light and fun.</p>
<p>Players looking for a warm, exotic fantasy will enjoy this game.</p>
<p>Bigger wins are scarce in this highly volatile Yggdrasil Gaming slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The music is theatrical with dramatic drums and mystical flutes. The reels spin with the sound of rumbling stones. Upon winning, the explosion of the volcano is extremely satisfying.</p>
<p>The mask symbols present a touristy impression of Polynsesian tribal art, but are eye-catching. Each mask has a unique colour and expression and their eyes glow on winning spins.</p>
<p>The highlight is the animation of the gushing lava that pours over the reels when the player wins. This creates a gratifying moment before the next spin.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Hyper Burst is a six reel, four row slot, with twenty-five win lines.</p>
<p>When players win, this triggers the Respin mode. This means that two of the four middle reels combine to form two-by-two symbols. Further Respins increase the size of these blocks by one.</p>
<p>While in this mode, consecutive wins will prompt another Respin and trigger the lava reel to grow.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. If the Wild symbols’ own payouts are worth more, this is activated instead.</p>
<p>During Respins, if the lava reel has grown to be four reels wide, Hyper Mode is activated.</p>
<p>Each win awards a respin and the lava reel expands by one reel</p>
<p>The Hyper Mode begins by giving players a x2 Multiplier. Every consecutive win also gives players another Respin (this is unlimited). Meanwhile, the Multiplier can increase up to x10.</p>
<p>This serves as the game's only Bonus feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96%, exactly our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this volcano-themed game with medium RTP and high volatility that meshes well with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>The steamy Polynesian setting is a great escape and the gushes of lava during Hyper Mode add showstopping drama.</p>
<p>Players will enjoy the colourful island world, and the engaging pace of gameplay.</p>
