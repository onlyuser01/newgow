    <h1>Fortune Online Casino Casinos In Panama City Florida Dreams Casino 200 No Deposit Bonus Codes Carniv</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether you'll be able to help with this complaint or not as Fortune Clock appear to be unregulated but thought I'd give you a try anyway.</p>
<p>I've had a number of issues with them over the last few months, largely relating to withdrawal delays and them waiting for their maximum 36 hour withdrawal times before depositing funds into my account, however this issue is different.</p>
<p>I played over the course of last week, depositing €900 by Friday and doing okay. On Saturday I received an email from my Account Manager Emily, advising that if I deposited a further €100 before the week ended, I'd be eligible for 10% cash back of €1000 or more deposited during that week. I proceeded and sadly lost all that I had deposited, albeit having made a withdrawal but depositing it again and coming out with nothing.</p>
<p>I received a follow-up email yesterday advising that Emily had spoken with the Bonus Team and that they wouldn't be honouring the cashback as I had made a withdrawal during that week and that due to this I was actually better off. I explained that by this time I hadn't benefitted at all and that I'd only added additional funds on the basis that I'd have the cashback as a safety net.</p>
<p>I have the email if it helps.</p>
<p>Please can you let me know your thoughts?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Stephen</p>
