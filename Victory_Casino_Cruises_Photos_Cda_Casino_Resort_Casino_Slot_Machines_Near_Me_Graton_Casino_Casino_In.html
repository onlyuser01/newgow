<p>Horse racing industry data analytics and content supplier BetMakers Technology Group announced its partnership with Supreme Ventures’ subsidiaries Supreme Ventures Racing and Entertainment Limited (SVREL) and Prime Sports Jamaica (PSJ) saw the launch of fixed odds betting at Caymanas Park racetrack.</p>
<p>Managing Fixed Odds Betting</p>
<p>BetMakers’ Managed Trading Services Division will manage fixed odds wagering for all fixed odds bets placed on Jamaican and international race meetings via betting stands at Caymanas Park racetrack.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, BetMakers’ head of Business Development USA Dallas Baker hailed Jamaica’s culture and passion for horse racing, as well as the potential the vertical represents for betting operators.</p>
<p>“The culture and passion for racing in Jamaica really needs to be seen to be believed,” Baker said, adding that “Jamaica punches well above its weight when it comes to betting handle,” anticipating the “exciting times” ahead following BetMakers’ launch of fixed odds wagering “in a second jurisdiction in the Americas.”</p>
<p>BetMakers and the two subsidiaries of Supreme Ventures partnered almost two years ago when they signed exclusive five-year deals, under which BetMakers received the exclusive right to manage fixed odds on all racing at SVREL venues and online in Jamaica and distribute Jamaican racing from Caymanas Park internationally.</p>
<p>“Committed to the Growth of Racing”</p>
<p>“Like all of our partner tracks, we are committed to the growth of racing and reinvestment in the industry,” Baker continued, using as an example Australia’s “boom in racing handle over the 15 years following the deregulation of fixed odds betting” which saw the emergence of new industry players and brought innovation and technology to a higher level to enhance customer experience to “an all-time high.”</p>
<p>Under the 2020 deal, BetMakers will also manage SVREL’s fixed odds betting at more than 100 off-track betting (OTB) parlors and serve as SVREL’s sponsor in exchange for the exclusive naming and branding rights to a new trainers pavilion at Caymanas Park racetrack, as well as broad advertising rights for key events.</p>
<p>Baker continued by paying tribute to the team at Caymanas Park spearheaded by Chairman Solomon Sharpe and its commitment to promoting horse racing, outlining the team at BetMakers is more than willing “join with them in efforts to grow racing for all participants in Jamaica,” stressing that the launch is the first step in the multi-faceted partnership with Supreme Ventures “where both parties are committed to working together for the benefit of the industry.”</p>
<p>BetMakers Technology Group also confirmed that its online fixed odds wagering will be available early next year at the official betting site of Caymanas Park racetrack.</p>
