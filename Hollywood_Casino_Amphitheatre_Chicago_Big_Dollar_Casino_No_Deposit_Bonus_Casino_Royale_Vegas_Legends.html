    <h1>Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Chicago Big Dollar Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino Royale Vegas Legends</h1>

<p>i contacted them today in live chat asking for update but he told me we dont work with refunds.</p>
<p>i sent him a screenshot showing the withdrawal as initilized and same time as available balance /</p>
<p>if the casino was honest they immidiatly should have apoligized and compensated my deposits as good gesture at the end it is their fault that this happened . i requested 3x a withdrawal does that not mean i really wanted toi cashout and it was my intention not to keep play.oke i played away my win but that does not take the facts away that they created the opertunity to do that.besides the site is horrible lagging and slow and i get kicked out of the game every 2 spins.i remember you have CG a codex about restricted countrys,if a player manege to acces the site from a restricted country he should be payed in case of a win and refunded ?</p>
