<p>The leading provider of content for the online gambling industry, Pragmatic Play, will be showcasing its products and speaking at this year's Peru Gaming Show (PGS), one of the most anticipated events in Latin America for the gambling vertical. This year's edition of the Show marks a milestone moment as it is its 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>Following tradition, this year's PGS will attract globally-recognized operators, software developers and providers. It marks an important event for the Latin American region where companies can engage in networking opportunities and exhibit their products.</p>
<p>The 20th edition of PGS is set to take place at Jockey Exhibition Center in Lima, Peru. The expo and conferences are scheduled for June 14 and June 15, 2023, while exclusive networking opportunities are planned for June 13, 2023. On June 14 and 15, the Show has planned different panels and seminars that will discuss future and current trends and interesting topics within the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Victor Arias, Pragmatic Play's Vice President of LatAm Operations, will be presenting the company for the event. He will participate in different panels between June 14 and June 15 along with other members of the company.</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement in a statement, Arias said: "We are always excited to be attending the Peru Gaming Show and this year looks to be an extra special one, as we celebrate the eventâ€™s 20th anniversary and provide market-leading insights across the two days."</p>
<p>Finally, Pragmatic Play's Vice President of LatAm Operations added: "PGS allows us to showcase our products and services within Latin America, where we've become a prominent name in the industry. We embrace the opportunity to expand on partner relationships, foster new ones and celebrate our success in the region thus far."</p>
<p>As noted by Arias, PGS will provide a unique opportunity for Pragmatic Play to showcase its products. The company will hold an exhibition in stands 46 and 49 during the two-day show. This will allow it to present its leading technology and games, unlocking new growth opportunities for the Latin American region.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play's latest announcement comes on the heels of an important deal. Only recently, the company confirmed it signed a new partnership with ComeOn Group. Under the terms of the new collaboration, Pragmatic agreed to supply its Live Casino solution for ComeOn.nl in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Other than that, Pragmatic continues to grow its content portfolio and only recently released a new slot called Sticky Bees. The new 7x7 reel slot game features a naturalistic theme, quality graphics and engaging features.</p>
