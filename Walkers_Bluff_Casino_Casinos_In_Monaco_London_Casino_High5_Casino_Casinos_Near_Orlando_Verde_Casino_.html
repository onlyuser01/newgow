    <h1>Walkers Bluff Casino Casinos In Monaco London Casino High5 Casino Casinos Near Orlando Verde Casino</h1>

<p>I started playing on the Verde Casino app and made two deposits from my Bancomer bank card in digital format. I won around 1000 pesos on the first day and requested to withdraw it in two parts. They asked me to verify my personal data account, which I did by uploading the necessary documents. They promised to inform me of the verification results between 5 minutes to 12 hours via my email, not on the deposits. The withdrawal attempts were rejected due to issues with the document verification. I contacted customer support through the online chat, and they advised me the same instructions for verifying my information and to have patience.</p>
<p>I continued to play and won almost 3000 pesos, and again, the same problem occurred. There were excuses about the documentation, which I uploaded again in the required size and format. When I contacted the online chat, they advised me to be patient and thanked me for submitting the necessary documentation again. After waiting 12 hours, I received another email confirming again that the verification was unsuitable and my withdrawals were denied again.</p>
<p>I wanted to added more information, but the app would not permit me to input more data, stating that the verification process was complete, but there was still no successful cash withdrawal.</p>
<p>The app is TERRIBLE. I don't understand how Google allows this type of fraud.</p>
<p>Plus, all of their emails were in English, adding more confusion to the process.</p>
<p>I believe they should verify the users before the first deposit is made, not when they try to withdraw the money they have "won".</p>
<p>The experience was unpleasant to say the least.</p>
<p>I would NOT recommend this app at all. COMPLETE ALERT - DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAPS OF THESE DISHONEST, NON-SERIOUS PEOPLE WHO LACK A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. THEY HIDE BEHIND A COMPUTER TO CONTINUE SCAMMING PEOPLE.</p>
<p>If there was an option to file a lawsuit, I would without hesitation.</p>
<p>It's a shame that laws in our country aren't enforced against these scammers.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention, I hope that people do not fall into these ILLEGAL practices.</p>
