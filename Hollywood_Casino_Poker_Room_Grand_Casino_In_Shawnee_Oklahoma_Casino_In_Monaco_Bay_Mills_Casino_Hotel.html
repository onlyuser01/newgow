<p>Complaints</p>
<p>So., 10. Dez. 2023 um 18:23</p>
<p>Dear Licensing Authority,</p>
<p>Thank you for your message.</p>
<p>However, I would like to clarify the facts in my following e-mail to you.</p>
<p>Therefore a comparison with the claims of the casino and the reality. I'll list them one below the other.</p>
<p>Casino Claim:</p>
<p>We would like to bring to your attention that up until the email received on 20.11.2022, we were not made aware of the customer's concern regarding Gambling addiction. As soon as the customer notified us about this matter, we took immediate action and closed his account on the subsequent day.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reality:</p>
<p>This is categorically untrue, as the image of the chat with the VIP Manager was before that date and the gambling addiction was mentioned there, he even gave me a bonus straight after I mentioned it. The burden of proof was put on me to reprodcue a chat protocol I had not backed up before the old phone broke. The burden of proof should be on the casinos side, as keeping records is certainly mandated. Keep in mind the same account manager handled me on all 3 brands. Furthermore, any session duration and spending checks have been ignored and the Source of Funds was not established. After this chat, the operator has failed to close my accounts on th eother brands as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Casino Claim:</p>
<p>Regarding the customer's claim on the license and his condition with gambling addiction, we have already communicated with him, discussing his responsibilities in accordance with our terms and conditions as mentioned below:</p>
<p>4.1 By opening an account on our Website and by using our Website you warrant that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you are acting on your own behalf;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you do not have a gambling addiction, you don’t use the Website under the influence of alcohol, drugs or other substances;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;…&gt;</p>
<hr />
<p>Reality:</p>
<p>This is a one way rule and does not absolve the casino of any consequent wrongdoing, an addiction can be developped after the fact and addicted persons will not declare themselves as addicted or read the terms. Besides, this part of the Terms and Condistions has not been on the website when I signed up, you can certainly confirm this with the operator which will have GIT commits and logs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Casino Claim:</p>
<p>2.2 The Company does not provide any assurances or warranties with regards to the legality of your use of the Website, particularly in case gambling is prohibited, regulated or unregulated in your jurisdiction. It is solely your responsibility to know the laws of your country concerning online gambling and the use of the Website, at all times. Before attempting to open an account with the Website and thereafter each time before using it you must verify whether online gambling is legal in your particular jurisdiction. By using this Website, you warrant that you are legally allowed to gamble online. If at any time online gambling in your jurisdiction becomes illegal or otherwise restricted, you must immediately close your account with the Website and stop using its services.</p>
<p>&lt;…&gt;</p>
<hr />
<p>Reality:</p>
<p>This part of the terms does not hold any water before a German court and you full well know this, the duty to close accounts from restricted countries and prevent sign ups falls on the casino, the casino even hired German speaking VIP Account Managers, while all the German speaking countries outlaw playing on a non local licenced casino. The country selection option was always available and still is.</p>
<hr />
<p>Casino Claim:</p>
<p>3.8 Self-exclusion request: you can contact the customer service via e-mail, and we will assist you in closing your account. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to notify the Company of any other accounts you may have with us, and to refrain from opening any new accounts. The Company will make reasonable efforts to prevent the opening of new accounts but it's ultimately your sole responsibility to make sure no other accounts are opened. The Company shall not be liable for potential losses on other accounts. We are not liable for any losses or damages which could be potentially caused by gambling.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reality:</p>
<p>These reasonable efforts standards appear to be rather low and again, you cannot push the liability to the players like that, you are aware of that, as you have been made liable in German courts before.</p>
