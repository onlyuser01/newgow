    <h1>Mystic Lake Hotel Casino Milwaukee Casinos Live Social Casino Casino Royal Offers Newyorknewyorklasv</h1>

<p>Hi guys, I really don't know what to do anymore. On January 4th I played and reached the BigBadWolf slot. The casino implements the 5 second rule everywhere and the maximum bet of 1 EUR.</p>
<p>However, I was able to play higher stakes in this slot. So it was actually clear to me that it was a kind of test slot, or a just for fun game. However, all my money was gone afterwards. The support passed this on. I have been assured ever since that they are working on it. However, I don't hear anything. In addition, my account has been blocked for real money stakes for a week. I can prove everything and now really wonder if I am also the culprit. You can't give me a timeline either, and you put me off every time. I just want my money back and now I think that compensation would be appropriate, I have already left money well in the casino whlgermekt and everything has always worked. But I'm just not getting anywhere here.</p>
<p>Can you help me there?</p>
