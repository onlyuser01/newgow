    <h1>Gold Coast Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Wow Casino No Deposit Bonus How Much Do Dealers Make In Casino</h1>

<p>Good morning I find myself with another problem with this casino. Last Saturday I ask for a withdrawal of 3900 euros ... they don't accept it because they answer me that I have to make a maximum of 3 at a time with an amount of 1500 euros each. I do this even if it doesn't seem correct. They spend more than 48 hours but still do not escape anything..the contact and they tell me that there are too many withdrawals pending and are late ... but obviously it is clear that it is an excuse ... among other things on this site I lost a lot ... then as soon as I won a higher amount they started to find excuses .... so after more than 48 hours they told me that today it was escaped ... but nothing when contacting them always took time ... so I cancel the withdrawals and replay them ... and strangely I lose them all in a strange way at the live casino '... I ask that at least the 2 withdrawals of 1500 euro each be returned to my account ... since they did not respect the timing. And above all they are unfair because they do not accept a single withdrawal of more than 1500 euros. It is clear that they disadvantage players. I ask you to contact the casino immediately. And that they give me at least my 3,000 Euros which should have escaped me in 48 hours and they didn't. Help me</p>
