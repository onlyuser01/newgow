<p>Manchester United Playing Terrific Soccer Right Now</p>
<p>The Red Devils are 6-0 in all competitions since the end of the World Cup break. During their surge, we saw them score a total of 15 goals while conceding just one. As a result of their superb run, Man United are through to the later stages of the EFL Cup and the FA Cup, while also making it into the top 4 in the Premier League.</p>
<p>Erik ten Hag has now recorded 20 wins in only 27 matches with Manchester United. ‚úÖ</p>

<p>Speaking of the English top-flight, that‚Äôs where Erik ten Haag‚Äôs men are 4-0 in their last four, which has helped them get to the No. 4 position in the standings. With 35 points, they‚Äôre level with No. 3 Newcastle, with one game in hand. They‚Äôre also relatively close to Manchester City who are four points ahead.</p>
<p>Table leaders Arsenal are slightly far ahead ‚Äì by 9 points ‚Äì but if the Red Devils can keep on playing top soccer, they might be able to catch up with them. So, can they continue playing great? We‚Äôre not so sure.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs just that their EPL schedule has been relatively easy in the last couple of weeks, so it‚Äôs not too much of a surprise that they‚Äôve won so many games. Beating Man City, on the other hand, would be a sign that they mean business.</p>
<p>Manchester City Still Favored to Win the EPL Title</p>
<p>Despite trailing by five points behind Arsenal, the reigning champions are favored to win the Premier League once again. Right now, online sportsbooks are giving -175 on the Citizens to keep the EPL trophy in their possession.</p>
<p>The reason? Manchester City‚Äôs roster is incredibly good. In fact, this is the most valuable squad in the world, with players like Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne, and others who seem capable of outplaying any opponent at any given location. This includes their city rivals even in the games played at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>Actually, Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men won the previous two Manchester Derbies played at Old Trafford, each time by 2-0 scoreline. They also won the last two duels played at Etihad Stadium, with the most recent one being a 6-3 win. That game took place last October when we saw Erling Haaland and Phil Foden score a hat-trick each.</p>
<p>Manchester United vs Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>The Red Devils are 4-0 in the Premier League in the last four, but the teams they defeated are Fulham, Nottingham Forest, Wolves, and Bournemouth. Three of those are currently in the bottom five positions in the EPL standings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Man City have had a tough couple of fixtures lately, most notably their previous game with Chelsea which they won 1-0. If they could beat the Blues in London, why wouldn‚Äôt they beat the Red Devils in Manchester?</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester City to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
