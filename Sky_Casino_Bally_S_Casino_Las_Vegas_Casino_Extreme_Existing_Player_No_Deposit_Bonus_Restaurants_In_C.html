    <h1>Sky Casino Bally S Casino Las Vegas Casino Extreme Existing Player No Deposit Bonus Restaurants In C</h1>

<p>I deposited 50 euros and received another 50 euros bonus. Then I started playing. I first played with small amounts and then with bets of 5 and higher amounts before I wagered this bonus 35 times. I came up with an amount of 9,000 euros, of which I wanted to withdraw 4500 euros. 2 days after pressing withdraw, I received a message that my pending withdrawal was rejected. Then I quote:</p>
<p>As mentioned in our bonus terms and conditions, wagers on any game using the betting system do not count towards the wagering requirements.</p>
<p>"We reserve the right to withhold an amount in excess of a player's original deposit if the player has placed wagers of a maximum of € 4 or € 0.50 per line or 15 percent of the bonus amount before the wagering requirements for that player certain bonuses have been met.</p>
<p>Please note that the original deposit is available in your account. "</p>
<p>It was not pointed out during the game that I was not allowed to flush with a high stake. Also, it was not possible for me to see at any time when I had fulfilled these bonus conditions so that I would have had to play with a smaller stake the whole time. I also play with other providers, something like this has never happened to me. I think it's a cheek. You can imagine how it's going to be someone who expects to pay 4500 euros and have another 4500 euros in credit. Instead, the 4500 euros I wanted to pay off were withheld, as well as the remaining 4450 euros. So I only had 50 instead of 8950 euros. When I contacted the chat I was told that you were sorry but there was nothing you could do. Only the 50 euros I paid were available. All the winnings were gone and were simply deleted from my account. It wasn't even offered that I wager the amount again with a stake that you determined. Just keep the money.</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken, I have also played high with other providers before the bonus condition was met, but the payout has never been denied to me. I've never seen anything like it before.</p>
<p>I turn to you now because I really don't know what to do next. I would be very happy if you would help me further by establishing the Kontalt or tell me how to proceed so that I get at least part of the 8950 euros. I would also be happy if you achieved that I have to wager the amount with a certain stake or whatever I have to do in order to get my winnings or at least part of it.</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your support and wish you a nice evening.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
