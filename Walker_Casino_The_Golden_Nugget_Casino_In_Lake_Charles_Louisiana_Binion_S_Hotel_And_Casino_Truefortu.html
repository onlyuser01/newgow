    <h1>Walker Casino The Golden Nugget Casino In Lake Charles Louisiana Binion S Hotel And Casino Truefortu</h1>

<p>Another week and another golf event is taking place with the 2021 PGA Tour World Wide Technology Championship promising to be a worthwhile event. Hosted out of Playa Del Carmen, Mexico this Thursday, November 4, the event will bring back a number of great golfers. Most of them decided to give the Bermuda Championship the cold shoulder, but quite a few big names will be coming back for the World Wide Technology Championship.</p>
<p>Justin Thomas and Brooks Koepka are topping the odds for this edition and that means we will see a lot of cut-throat action at the very top. Yet, there are many other golfers to keep an eye out for, and those include Viktor Hovland and Abraham Ancer, both of whom have been showing a lot of promise and consistency. In fact, Koepka falls behind both.</p>
<p>Of course, there are the golf course’s particularities to factor in. In any event, the 2021 World Wide Technology Championship will offer golf fans a great opportunity to place a bet on a field of talented players.</p>

<p>The 2021 World Wide Technology Championship is taking place on Thursday, November 4. The event will be broadcast on the Golf Channel on Thursday-Friday at 3 pm ET and the Saturday and Sunday coverage will air at 2 pm and 5 pm ET.</p>
<p>Lay of the Land: What to Expect from the Event?</p>
<p>There are plenty of great golfers who are going to be showing up for this one and you would probably want to try betting on the ones that have the best chances of success. That is where we come in. First, we have Justin Thomas (+1000) who is given great odds of succeeding.</p>
<p>However, there are a few caveats to mention here. For starters, he hasn’t won an event since his showing at the PLAYERS Championship in March this year. Yet, he has amassed 16 PGA Tour wins in his career, making him one of the most capable golfers to enter the field.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of success in recent events, JT is definitely looking strong in this one and his momentary slump may be coming to an end. We believe that the El Camaleón Golf Club could be a great place for him to break out of his doldrums and swing for a win.</p>
<p>What about Viktor Hovland (+1400) then? Well, he is given great odds just the same. Hovland won the event in 2020 which gives him a strong foothold in tomorrow’s competition.</p>
<p>He has done a few T18 and T40’s of late, with his most notable showing during the Tour Championship back in September when he finished T5. Hovland has what it takes to bring this one home, but he will need to do consistently better than his last few showings.</p>
<p>How about some of the long shots here? Billy Horschel (+3100) definitely doesn’t stand out from the rest, but he has done fairly well at this golf course. He was tied for fifth place last year and he has a good track record on short tracks throughout his career. He has numerous T10 finishes and this will give him a fair shot in the upcoming event. However, Thomas seems the best pick here, along with Hovland that is.</p>
