<p>Leap Gaming, a B2B supplier of high-end virtual games for online, mobile, and retail markets, has received a license by the Spelinspektionen (Sweden’s Gambling Authority, SGA), allowing it to launch its offerings in the country.</p>
<p>Leap Gaming Secures a Swedish License</p>
<p>Following this achievement, the provider will be able to power the SGA licensees with its proprietary gambling titles. This deal is a monumental milestone for the company as Sweden remains one of the biggest markets in Europe.</p>
<p>By launching in Sweden, Leap Gaming will significantly increase its footprint in the European gambling sector. The company has been steadily expanding across the continent’s regulated markets, launching its critically-acclaimed offerings in several of the key markets. Leap Gaming extended its presence to Spain and Italy and even launched on the newly-regulated Dutch gambling market.</p>
<p>Leap Gaming’s titles are renowned for their quality, which helps the provider grow its reach. By launching in more jurisdictions, the company gets the opportunity to sign numerous new deals and increase its overall presence. Sweden boasts some of the biggest gambling brands in Europe, which is a great opportunity for Leap. Following the approval by the SGA, the operator can legally power brands such as Betsson, Evolution Gaming, and LeoVegas with its state-of-the-art products.</p>
<p>Sweden Continues to Be a Top Betting Market</p>
<p>The Swedish gambling market is considered to be one of the best in Europe. So much so, that countless unlicensed operators have tried to appeal to the local punters, much to the dismay of the SGA.</p>
<p>The market has been steadily growing in 2022 and continues following this tendency to this day. The majority of people prefer playing from home, which has cemented online betting as the main driving force in Sweden. In January, the country’s gambling authority reported that seven percent more people have started playing for money.</p>
<p>With such a high interest, gambling regulation has been a key topic of the SGA. As mentioned, the country has been having a problem with unlicensed operators taking unregulated bets. Additionally, the authority’s envisioned gambling reforms that can change some of the established rules. While the SGA rejected the idea of bringing back gambling limits, it did decide to introduce new regulations to better control the market.</p>
<p>The most recent change was SGA’s decision to introduce a $12,000 application fee for operators who want to apply for a license. This sum is more than twice as much for renewing a license, sitting between $31,000 and $62,000.</p>
