<p>The partnership was made possible by the Dench eGaming Solutions platform</p>
<p>Spinomenal, a leading provider of iGaming content, has signed a major Bulgaria-facing deal with Alphawin. Under the agreement with the local operator, the supplier will provide games to the Bulgarian market.</p>
<p>The new integration is made possible thanks to the Dench eGaming Solutions platform. As a result, a variety of gaming titles will be injected into Alphawin’s platform. This will include a rich suite of popular Spinomenal games, such as Book of Rampage, Lucky Jack – Lost Jungle, Majestic King and Queen of Ice and Demi Gods 2.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Alphawin players will be able to access the Spinomenal Universe, which includes many great games, such as the recently-released Book of Lucky Jack – Baba Yaga’s Tales.</p>
<p>Alphawin is a fairly new but ambitious Bulgarian operator that will allow Spinomenal to greatly expand its presence in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Spinomenal Is Looking Forward to Growing in Bulgaria</p>
<p>Spinomenal posted an update on LinkedIn, thanking everyone who made this agreement possible, including Alphawin’s Adriana Dasheva and Dench eGaming Solutions’ Adrian Toshkov and Dobromir Mitev.</p>
<p>In addition, representatives from Aphawin and Spinomenal addressed the matter, sharing their excitement about the deal.</p>
<p>Adriana Dasheva, Alphawin’s head of casino, praised Spinomenal’s exceptional games for their outstanding visual quality and engaging features. According to her, the games are well-suited for the Alphawin platform.</p>
<p>With its high-quality graphics and wide range of features, the Spinomenal portfolio is a great fit for our casino. We’re excited to be working towards a long-lasting highly successful partnership as we take the Bulgarian market to the next level together. Adriana Dasheva, head of casino, Alphawin</p>
<p>In the meantime, Spinomenal’s chief executive officer, Lior Shvartz, praised the Bulgarian iGaming market, saying that it represents a big opportunity for his company. He echoed Dasheva’s words, expressing his desire for a successful long-term partnership with the operator.</p>
<p>Bulgaria is a significant iGaming market for us and we’re very happy to officially launch our games within Alphawin’s online casino offering. We look forward to strengthening our partnership as we work together to make a long-term success of the deal. Lior Shvartz, CEO, Spinomenal</p>
