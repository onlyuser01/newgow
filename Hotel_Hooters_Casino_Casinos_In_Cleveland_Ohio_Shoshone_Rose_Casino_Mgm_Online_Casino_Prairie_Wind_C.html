<p>Leading sports technology company at the intersection between sports, betting, and media Sportradar has announced it would fuel the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) Men’s T20 World Cup with a fresh live fielding data tool. The tool will be used to collect innovative cricket data during the ongoing cricket event Down Under. At the moment, Sportradar is ICC’s official data provider.</p>
<p>Sportradar’s Proprietary Tool, a World Premiere</p>
<p>The new proprietary tool has never been used before. It will be used to gather and code regular bowling and batting statistics as well as comprehensive fielding data by capturing as many as 80 different data points per every bowled ball. This will be possible by using the lowest latency rate possible in the industry. The collected data will fuel ICC’s fan-oriented platform as well as the official mobile app. It will also make an appearance on bespoke international media outlets and new broadcaster feeds. This is expected to help set the ground and expand live commentary with the help of more detailed insights into the action.</p>
<p>At the same time, cricket aficionados will improve their level of engagement with the popular sport by getting a deeper understanding of what is going on during a live match. At the same time, the same tool is expected to help global cricket boards access the analytics for cricket teams, high performance, assets, and power match centers. In return, this should simplify the selection and ranking methodology for players in the upcoming future.</p>
<p>“Committed to Delivering Innovation” to Grow the Sport</p>
<p>Speaking about their goals, Sportradar’s managing director for Strategy and Sports Solutions Sam Taylor explained that Sportradar is all about creating the “most intelligent cricket platform” on the planet. He also explained the company’s fresh data capture tool represents a new “step in this direction.” Taylor expressed the company’s commitment to “delivering innovation and technology” that would help expand cricket as a sport. He acknowledged Sportradar’s thrill regarding the event that the company has chosen for the launch of the fresh tool. The event consisting of group stages and knockouts is the eighth ICC Men’s T20 World Cup tournament and it will be held in Australia from October 16 to November 13.</p>
<p>Sportradar currently provides over 1,700 sports federations, operators, media outlets, and player platforms in 120 countries with its know-how and technology. The company has over 3,500 full-time employees spread across 20 different countries. At the beginning of October, the company agreed to have its Orako and trading services integrated into Pragmatic Solutions’ player. The previous month, SportsGrid Technology Solutions announced it would integrate its proprietary video and editorial content into Sportradar’s tools used for data and visualization account management platform.</p>
