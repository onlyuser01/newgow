<p>Leading casino technology company Playtech has signed a new content distribution deal with the pioneer gaming company that introduced Atlantic City to gambling four decades ago, Resorts Digital Gaming. Playtech’s innovative community gameshow “Live Slots” will reach Resorts’ players, along with some of the freshest releases that incorporate revolving studio designs and mesmerizing augmented reality modes.</p>
<p>The New Deal to Bring Superior Experiences to Players</p>
<p>Playtech will get its innovative products and services up and running via Omni-Channel technology, with the promise of creating a superior player experience. The supplier will offer its Live Entertainment, Live casino, and iCasino content to the online platforms hosting Mohegan Sun Casino and Resorts Casino. The launch of the fresh and exciting content will be simultaneous with the launch of Resorts’ own channel for live streaming. The Playtech games launch is still pending approval from the Division of Gaming Enforcement in New Jersey. The division was founded in 1977 under the Casino Control Act. Its main purpose is to protect the integrity of the gambling industry in the state.</p>
<p>Resorts‘ players will get access to game shows with revolving studio designs such as Adventures Beyond Wonderland or Buffalo Blitz. They will, this way, get to test games based on augmented reality for the first time. Playtech has also been working on a one-of-a-kind social game show called “Live Slots.” The game is led by a presenter. Players get to share both their losses and wins, expressing the unity of the gaming community.</p>
<p>The Partnership Is “An Exciting Step” Towards New Heights</p>
<p>Playtech’s chief operating officer Shimon Akad expressed the company’s delight “to be working with one of New Jersey’s most iconic gaming brands.” He called the partnership “an exciting step” toward offering a larger number of US gamers with secure, seamless, and highly enjoyable experiences. Akad also spoke about Playtech’ ability to create and maintain important “strategic partnerships” with leading operators in the industry from all parts of the planet.</p>
<p>Resorts’ chief executive officer Ed Andrewes expressed similar views and feelings of excitement for sealing the deal with Playtech, while bringing “an enhanced gaming experience” to its loyal customers via the supplier’s innovative products. Andrews also said the company was ready for additional expansion and diversification steps in the future next to Playtech, with the purpose of delivering “more unforgettable experiences” for players.</p>
<p>Playtech started 2022 with impressively good financial results as shown by its first-quarter results. In June, the company decided to sell its underperforming financial trading division for $250 million.</p>
