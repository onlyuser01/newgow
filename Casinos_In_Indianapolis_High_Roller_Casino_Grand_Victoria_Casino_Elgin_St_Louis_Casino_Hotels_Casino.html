    <h1>Casinos In Indianapolis High Roller Casino Grand Victoria Casino Elgin St Louis Casino Hotels Casino</h1>

<p>My payout has been going on for almost 3 months now, at first I thought everything was quite normal and understandable until the payout process became more and more viscous and I am here now waiting for my next payout of 500 euros to be confirmed (500 is the daily limit) which already is waiting for confirmation for almost a month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it became more and more noticeable that the support team does not really help but rather lets time pass and actively tries to make this process last longer and then there is less and less information coming out later on in the course of this problem and one has the feeling more and more straight to be scammed.</p>
<p>I exchanged views with a few other people affected and this then showed that the method used is the same for alone (1000-1500 euros paid out where a far larger amount sits on the account balance and still has to be paid out`) this is at all the same.</p>
<p>It seems as if this action was planned and one never had the intention to found a functioning casino.</p>
<p>As a further refinement, the bonus offer seems very lucrative in order to attract as many players as possible. Daily deposit bonuses of 200% and upwards are very unusual in the industry but are still represented.</p>
<p>In summary, there is a lot to be said against the casino, if you can even call it that.</p>
