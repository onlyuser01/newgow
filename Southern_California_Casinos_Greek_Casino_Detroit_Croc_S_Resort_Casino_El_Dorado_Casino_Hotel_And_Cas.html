The reel is presented at the center of the screen, while retro-style sound effects complement the gameplay that resembles a videogame from the ’90s.</p>
<p>Amit Samji, Push Gaming’s principal game producer, explained that Rat King represents the company’s first pay-anywhere game. “It also benefits from an inventive collection mechanic which is a testament to the incredible creativity our development team is blessed with,” he added. Finally, Samji predicted that the popular retro design, backed by engaging and thrilling features will catch the attention of online players.</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s newest slot game comes on the heels of an important content partnership with bet365 that dates back to earlier this month.

<p>Online Players Can Enjoy Multipliers, Free Spins</p>
<p>Players of Rat King can benefit from the game’s cascade mechanic. Landing at least seven or more symbols anywhere on the reel grants a win. Those symbols are then removed from the gameboard, allowing their spot to be filled by new symbols, granting a chance for consequent wins. Additionally, Rat King delivers multipliers that can boost the wins up to 500x, granting players a chance for significant payouts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, landing a minimum of three scatters can activate a bonus round. Collection of further scatters can grant players up to 20 spins. During the free spins round, “any multipliers collected are held throughout with each additional scatter granting three spins creating a culmination of mechanics, wins and increasing multiplier values,” explains Push Gaming.</p>
