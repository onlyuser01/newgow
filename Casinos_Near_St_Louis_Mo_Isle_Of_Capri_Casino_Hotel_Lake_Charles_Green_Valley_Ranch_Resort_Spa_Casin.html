    <h1>Casinos Near St Louis Mo Isle Of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa Casin</h1>

<p>Hi, I signed up with 24slots.com a few days ago trusting that they have Curacao egaming license 1668/JAZ as stated in their terms and conditions. I only sign up to casinos with this license because it's the only one that has a regulatory body to respond to complaints.</p>
<p>I actually later found out that this license is fake.</p>
<p>I then asked for explanations via email to their support and via chat.</p>
<p>No reply by email.</p>
<p>Via chat instead they gave me this embarrassing answer: "I would like to inform you that at the moment there are few problems regarding this. So I inform you that everything will be resolved as soon as possible". And then they immediately closed and blocked the chat.</p>
<p>Now they have also closed my gaming account without giving me any explanations.</p>
<p>I want to clarify that I have already paid €3680, of which €800 deposited last night by bank transfer but not yet credited to my gaming account. However, this amount was successfully debited from my bank account.</p>
<p>With this complaint, I therefore ask the casino to return the €800 deposited but not yet credited to the gaming account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe it is right that I am also fully reimbursed for the money lost (2880€) due to false communications on their gaming license.</p>
<p>If a player communicates false communications to the casino about his identity or payment methods we know what happens.</p>
<p>When it is the casino that does it, however, it must answer in the same way as we do with them in case of violations.</p>
