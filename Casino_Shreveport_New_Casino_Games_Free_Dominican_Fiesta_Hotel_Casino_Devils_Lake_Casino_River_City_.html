<p>Caesars Entertainment, one of the world’s largest gambling companies, has released its 14th Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report, a company-wide initiative that is determined to promote better diversity, equity, and inclusion, supporting core values such as gender and racial parity in leadership positions.</p>
<p>The company is working towards a goal to achieve such parity by 2025 and continue to be a leader in the promotion of such values in the gambling industry as a whole. Apart from its commitment to a diverse workforce, Caesars is similarly looking to reduce Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 100% by 2050, while continuing to support team members, invest in local communities and embark on other initiatives across numerous verticals.</p>
<p>Presently, the company’s strategic goals encompassed by its Social Responsibility Report focus on five main pillars, including Education, Team Member Support, Environmental Impact, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Community Investment, with the company tailoring its business to best meet these targets and goals.</p>
<p>The company is looking to divert waste from landfills, reduce water consumption, and slash its carbon footprint, as well as invest in the education of its members through initiatives such as the All-In On Education program which provides low to no-cost education options for its team members.</p>
<p>More than $1m has been distributed in the form of student debt assistance to over 400 team members as the company seeks to continue offering support. Overall, 14,700 team members have set up accounts with the company’s educational platform.</p>
<p>Commenting on the findings of the latest report, Caesars Entertainment SVP of Corporate Social ResponsibilityHeather Rapp welcomed the achievements of 2022 and spoke excitingly about the milestones achieved:</p>
<p>"In 2022 we focused on enhancing our existing goals as well as offering more robust support for our Team Members and communities. This past year’s progress is a reflection of the dedication of our leadership and our Team Members to making an impact both inside and outside of the Company."</p>
<p>Caesars has been investing in communities at a rapid pace, putting down $81m in 2022 alone, divvied up between various initiatives. In terms of environmental impact, 2022 saw a water consumption reduction of 14% compared to 2019, marking another significant success for the organization.</p>
<p>All the while, Caesars has been scaling up its presence in the digital and land-based gaming and hospitality sectors, continuing to operate as the biggest company in the United States.</p>
