<p>PostePay</p>
<p>What you get from your country's postal service depends on where you are – in Italy, you can get one of the country's most popular payment cards.</p>
<p>Poste Italiane launched PostePay in 2003 as a way for its customers to buy things online. At first, it was in the form of a simple prepaid card that users could load money onto at their local post office. According to the company itself, 13.8 million of the cards have been issued since, underlining just how popular the method is with the Italian people.</p>
<p>Prepaid cards were joined by PostePay debit cards before long, and improvements in technology brought along a dedicated app and digital wallet, making the service more accessible for users.</p>
<p>With Poste Italiane being the largest company in the Italian logistics sector and one of the leading financial firms, its logo is everywhere in Italy and almost part of the nation's identity. It's also listed on the Italian stock exchange and is 29.3% owned by the national government, so the PostePay service is regarded as extremely secure.</p>
<p>Read on to find out more about the advantages and disadvantages of using PostePay, how to make a deposit with it and how to find the best PostePay casino.</p>
<p>PostePay pros and cons</p>
<p>PostePay has several important positives that make it a popular option for online users. First, it's an extremely secure company as it's backed up by the Italian government, meaning that it's virtually impossible for the company to go bankrupt short of a national catastrophe. Its prepaid card is also a great option for online casino use as you can only spend what you put on the card. This makes it much easier to track what you spend and avoids using credit facilities, something that we advocate in our How to gamble safely article.</p>
<p>The card is also linked to Visa and Mastercard which means you can use it on any site that accepts these two payment options. This greatly increases the number of possibilities for users, and makes it one of most flexible payment methods in Italy.</p>
<p>PostePay is also incredibly simple to use. You just go to the nearest Poste Italiane branch, give the cashier your card and the amount of money you wish to load onto it. That's it. To get a card, all you need to do is share a few personal details – you don't even need a bank account.</p>
<p>Despite these perks, PostePay is out of reach if you live outside Italy. Only post offices there issue the cards, so to sign up you have to be within the Italian borders. Once you have one, though, you should be able to use it anywhere around the world in places that accept Visa and Mastercard.</p>
<p>Also, there are fees associated with some of PostePay's cards. This should only be a small annual amount, but it may be a little frustrating when there are so many free cards out there. To check these fees out, take a look on the official website.</p>
<p>How to use PostePay in online casinos</p>
<p>Once you've found a PostePay casino that you like, then depositing is simple. To do this, you simply follow the same process as you would with a debit or credit card.</p>
<p>Set up your casino account and make sure you're signed in Go to the casino's cashier section and select 'PostePay' from the list of methods Enter your PostePay card details, which should be the 16-digit card number, expiry date and CVV code Enter the deposit amount, double-check that everything is correct and click confirm.</p>
<p>You should have the funds arrive in your account right away, but it might take a short while longer. If they're not there after a couple of hours, then it might be a good idea to contact PostePay or the casino to check that everything has gone through fine.</p>
<p>If you're using a PostePay prepaid card, then you won't be able to withdraw with it – in which case you'll have to use a different method. It's possible that you can withdraw to a digital wallet, however, but this depends on the casino in question. To find out, just ask the casino's customer service team who should give you a quick response.</p>
