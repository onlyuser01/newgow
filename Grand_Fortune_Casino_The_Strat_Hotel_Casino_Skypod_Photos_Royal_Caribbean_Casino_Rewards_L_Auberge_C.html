<p>FuboTV, the streaming giant that now offers betting options through Fubo Gaming, has appointed Julie Haddon to its board of directors in a bid to reinforce the company’s executive lineup of sports career professionals. Haddon’s addition will give the company a boost as she’s the owner of the Chicago Red Stars women’s football team and will now sit on the audit committee and advise general strategy.</p>
<p>Much Valued Team Member Joins FuboTV</p>
<p>Haddon is not a chance appointment either. She has extensive experience working with some of the most prominent sports franchises and leagues out there, including holding a position as Senior VP of global brand and consumer marketing with the National Football League. She was the main initiator behind the NFL Pride LGBTQ+ group.</p>
<p>Her appointment was welcomed cordially by FuboTV co-founder and chief executive David Gandler who saw in her arrival an opportunity to elevate the overall company offer across media, tech, and sports coverage.</p>
<p>Gandler praised Haddon for her ability to build global audiences and having done so at the heart of some of the most popular franchised leagues out there. He added:</p>
<p>“I have no doubt Julie will bring a valuable perspective to FuboTV as we aim to transform the TV space for consumers while providing value to our shareholders. I’m looking forward to working closely with Julie and welcoming her to FuboTV’s board of directors.” FuboTV co-founder and chief executive David Gandler</p>
<p>Haddon also has other relevant B2B experience that is not necessarily connected to sports. The executive served in various positions at Blue Sky Studios and DreamWorks Animation. She is now part of the TOCA Football board and is a senior advisor for Bettor Capital, which is a venture company focusing on spurring innovation in sports betting and gaming.</p>
<p>A Worthwhile Addition to Fubo’s Lineup</p>
<p>Haddon was equally pleased to join and said that she was thrilled to be part of the company’s growth and help spearhead its further objectives.</p>
<p>She confirmed that she will be looking to innovate, accelerate and achieve all the opportunities that the company has set out for itself in order to provide fans better opportunities to engage with their favorite sports while never missing a moment of the experience through FuboTV.</p>
<p>FuboTV has been expanding its footprint at a good clip. In January, the company gained streaming rights for the English Premier League in Canada.</p>
