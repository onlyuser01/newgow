<p>Yggdrasil has partnered with ReelPlay for the launch of Greek-themed Hercules 10K WAYS, a slot with multi-level mode and the 10K WAYS mechanic</p>
<p>The 2013-founded iGaming publisher that constantly expands its global reach via YG Masters, YG Game IP, and YG Franchise, Yggdrasil, has sealed yet another exciting alliance with ReelPlay after the release of Bucks and Doe 10K WAYS this July and Going Wild in Vegas WildFight in August.</p>
<p>Together with the studio that is known as the “home to the original Infinity Reels”, Yggdrasil has created a mesmerizing storyline of “epic proportions” in the newly released Hercules 10K WAYS slot.</p>
<p>With an impressive win potential as a result of a plethora of bonus features mixed with the iconic 10K WAYS mechanic, the game is focused on one of the most popular of all heroes that Ancient Greek tales have given us – Hercules.</p>

<p>The New Slot, Part of the YG Masters Portfolio</p>
<p>Created with the help of Yggdrasil’s GATI technology that allowed ReelPlay to use a variety of preconfigured, standard toolkits to generate the cutting-edge content of the slot, Hercules 10K WAYS is the freshest ReelPlay release that is now part of the prestigious YG Masters portfolio.</p>
<p>The game closely follows equally interesting titles, including Going Wild in Vegas WildFight and Hot Rise’s Nightmares VS GigaBlox by Boomerang.</p>
<p>The exploration of the world-famous Greek heroes is done with the help of a plethora of “fearsome and richly rendered 3D beasts”, all defeated in the labors part of the well-known mythological tales. The list includes figures like Hydras, Cerberus, the Nemean Lion, or the Erymanthian Boar.</p>
<p>Hercules represents the wild symbol in the game. Once a win is scored in the base game, the winning symbols are taken off the reels, making way for fresh symbols seen dropping as part of the cascading wins feature.</p>
<p>Hercules Battles Spins and Victory Prizes</p>
<p>To activate the multi-level mode Hercules Battles Spins feature, players need to land at least five Golden Apples. During the multi-level mode, players who defeat all beasts receive a bonus Victory Prize.</p>
<p>Originally, players are entitled to three respins prior to the epic duel that will be carried between Hercules and several beasts. The corresponding symbols of the beasts will feature both prize and health values.</p>
<p>The feature will go on throughout multiple levels until Hercule no longer has any health left, or until he exits the battle victoriously.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s chief gaming officer, Mark McGinley, expressed their thrill about being able to breathe life into the Labours of Hercules, which he called some of the “most famous mythological tales ever told.”</p>
<p>At the same time, ReelPlay’s chief executive officer, David Johnson, called the new slot one that “features titanic tussles and ferocious fights” in an adventure filled with action that is meant to take their successful 10K WAYS mechanic one step further.</p>
<p>Last week, Yggdrasil released the Chinese-themed slot GigaGong GigaBlox with a maximum multiplier set at 2,498x and the popular Game Engagement Mechanic, GigaBlox, at the center.</p>
