<p>ESPN brings Kelly Stewart on board to help the program boost its expertise in sports betting and offer audiences more actionable information on key wagering contests.</p>
<p>Reinforcing ESPN’s Betting Podcasts with @KellyInVegas</p>
<p>Kelly Stewart is joining ESPN’s team as a sports betting analyst, bringing a vast experience and insight into the inner workings of sports betting, a vertical that ESPN now fully espouses and seeks to provide the best possible content for.</p>
<p>The addition of Kelly, known as @KellyInVegas as per her Twitter handle, is a step in this direction. ESPN’s daily sports betting news, Daily Wager, and the dedicated podcast of the same name will now benefit from Kelly’s expertise in all matters concerning sports wagering.</p>
<p>She will sit as an analyst and provide her unique insight into anything that has to do with sports betting across a number of media channels, including podcasts, radio shows, and join SportsCenter as well as other productions owned by ESPN.</p>
<p>ESPN senior coordinating producer Scott Clark has welcomed Stewart’s appointment and said her addition was expanding the program’s dedicated sports betting content. “She’ll be an important asset to all that we are doing in the space and like the rest of our sports betting team, she will be busy,” Clark added.</p>
<p>A Professional Long-in-the-Making</p>
<p>Stewart’s profile as a sports betting handicapper has long been in the making with over a decade of experience for leading publications from the world of sports, including Bleacher Report and WagerTalk.com.</p>
<p>“I’m very excited about my opportunity to work for ESPN,” Steward said accepting the position on ESPN’s team. She said that gambling has always been a part of her life and said that wagering against friends and on a plethora of events has always been something she cherished.</p>
<p>“I guess you could say the move to Las Vegas after college was just a natural progression for me, and I quickly gravitated to legal sports betting. I was privileged to be mentored by some of the best in the business,” she added.</p>
<p>Now, Stewart is looking to share that same expertise that got her into sports betting over 10 years ago with ESPN’s audiences.</p>
