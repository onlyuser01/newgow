    <h1>The Point Casino And Hotel Double Casino Promo Code Seneca Casino Niagara Falls Casino Royale Vesper</h1>

<p>The Casino Guru Awards project has been forging at full steam ahead, with our Responsible Gambling Tools and Social Responsibility Initiative judges fully revealed. Casino Guru has brought together more than 25 iGaming and industry professionals together to help assess and distinguish the most capable and driven companies in the industry, across a range of categories.</p>
<p>While all the entries we have received established players in the industry, there are only a few that will be able to grab the highest accolades this year during the Casino Guru Awards ceremony in February. To get there, your company first needs to head over to the nomination page and submit its bid. Nominations close at the end of November and the shortlists are released on December 1, 2022, so there is time to register your bid in one of six categories:</p>
<p>The Fairest Bonus Policy</p>
<p>The Fairest General T&amp;Câ€™s</p>
<p>The Most Impactful Social Responsibility Initiative</p>
<p>The Best Implementation of RG Tools</p>
<p>The Most Transparent Casino</p>
<p>The Most Effective Handling of Complaints</p>
<p>Should a casino website win, Casino Guru will issue a special badge that reflects that in our casino list. All applicants need provide their business and website name, a contact email and also a short 250-summary with the web submission. A separate letter that goes into more detail can be provided via the upload attachments on the official Casino Guru Awards website. While the application process is streamlined and simple, Casino Guru reminds you to review the description of the category your business is applying for carefully.</p>
<p>In case a confirmation email is not coming through once you have nominated your business, please contact us at awards@casino.guru. Hurry up and secure your nomination now. While you wait for the shortlist, we welcome you to visit the interviews section where we will habitually publish our conversations with all the participants in the Social ResponsibilityInitiative and Responsible Gambling Tools categories.</p>
