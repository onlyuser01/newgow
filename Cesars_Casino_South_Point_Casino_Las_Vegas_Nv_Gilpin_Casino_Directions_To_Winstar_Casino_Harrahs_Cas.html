    <h1>Cesars Casino South Point Casino Las Vegas Nv Gilpin Casino Directions To Winstar Casino Harrahs Cas</h1>

<p>I didn't even know I could ask them to resign!</p>
<p>Anyway, the withdrawal method had Pix, jeton and bitcoin, for those of us who live in Brazil and a bureaucracy to be able to make the bitcoin and jeton wallet!! Not to mention they have a very high withdrawal rate!</p>
<p>Pix is a better and faster method! They told me that it's instantaneous and that, of course, they do the verification every 36 hours. But mine is taking longer than expected because it's the PIX withdrawal method!</p>
<p>MY SECOND WITHDRAWAL ATTEMPT TODAY HAS BEEN 15 DAYS, AND MY MONEY DIDN'T DROP INTO MY BANK ACCOUNT AND NEITHER RETURNED TO THE BALANCE IN THE CASINO! , I think they are holding my money to not pay me ! because I knew pix withdrawal falls on time! And tomorrow the 08/07th will be ONE MONTH that I've been trying to make this withdrawal!</p>
<p>I need it to be by the pix method! If they have a problem, wouldn't it be better to deactivate the PIX withdrawal option? because I think this is disrespectful to the players!</p>
<p>And they always tell me to wait, wait, but I'm tired of waiting and I want my money in my bank account!</p>
<p>The first time I applied for a withdrawal, they said the payment provider was trying to send funds and the money was coming back! I contacted my bank NUBANK, and they told me that there was no attempt to deposit in my account !!!!</p>
<p>Chat staff does not solve my problem, I've been waiting for almost 1 month, they say they are solving the problem, but they never solve it !!! AND I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY MONEY IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT!!</p>
<p>How many more withdrawal attempts at this casino will I have to make? There are already 2 withdrawal attempts</p>
<p>And detail , the girl in the chat told me that it was for me to do it for bitcoin , I asked how many days it takes for the money to drop into my account , she told me it was 10 days , I asked if there would be delays too , she said that maybe yes , it could the same problems occur as the pix!</p>
<p>If she told me that (I have prints) and because there may also be a delay for another withdrawal method, which makes me think again, that they are the ones holding my money, and not letting it be processed in my bank account, and so on the balance returns to the casino so I can play and lose everything !!!!!</p>
<p>The first time I requested the withdrawal, it took 14 days and it returned to the game account, and this second time now, it's been 15 days and it didn't fall into my bank account and it didn't even return to the casino.</p>
