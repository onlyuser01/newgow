    <h1>Limitless Casino Free 100 Online Casino Michigan Hard Rock Casino Tahoe Station Casino Las Vegas Sta</h1>

<p>The company’s live division has introduced its latest game, Ukrainian Roulette, which consolidates its presence in the roulette genre</p>
<p>BETER Live has already developed several live casino versions of the popular game, including classic European and French variations, along with Gravity Roulette, now building upon this previous success with the addition of Ukrainian Roulette.</p>
<p>BETER Hosts First Ukrainian-Speaking Roulette</p>
<p>The game is available to BETER Live’s partners, and it has been built after a surge in demand for a product such as the one now presented by the developer. This game is unique as it features a Ukrainian-speaking presenter and the company has de facto built the first game to have done so.</p>
<p>BETER Live is confident that the new product will prove an immediate hit with partner operators, and their audiences who have long been keen to experience a high-quality, uninterrupted live casino roulette that is streamed in Ukrainian.</p>
<p>The game is hosted out of the Main BETER Live Studio to ensure that the game offers unchallenged visuals and smooth gameplay from start to finish. The colors of the Ukrainian flag are also visible in the game.</p>
<p>BETER Live Director Anna Vikmane has welcomed this new opportunity and said that BETER was very proud to be rolling out a new variation of the popular roulette game with a Ukrainian-speaking game presenter. Vikmane added:</p>
<p>What’s important for us is not only keeping pace with the latest trends in the iGaming industry, but also listening to the audience and understanding what products are most relevant to them. BETER Live Director Anna Vikmane</p>
<p>Vikmane said that BETER Live has the technological know-how to continue delivering content that players can associate themselves with.</p>
<p>BETER Continues to Focus on Tailor-Made Gameplay</p>
<p>BETER CEO Gal Ehrlich was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see BETER continue to deliver new and exciting content for its partner operators, meeting user demand in the process. BETER is moving more and more towards tailor-made products that are designed to resonate with bigger audiences and fill the vacuum in iGaming.</p>
<p>Ukrainian-speaking players now have a game that has been built exclusively for them. In the meantime, BETER Live launched Gravity Sic Bo, part of the Gravity series. The company has also been building up its experience and presence in various markets, but importantly – its technological capabilities and streaming capacity with two new studios in Romania launched in April.</p>
