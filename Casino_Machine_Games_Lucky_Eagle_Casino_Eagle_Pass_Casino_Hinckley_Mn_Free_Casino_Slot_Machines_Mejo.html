<p>Leading British online gaming company bet365 continues its foray into the key US market with another launch. The company’s offerings will now go live in Colorado, following an agreement with Century Casinos.</p>
<p>Bet365 Goes Live in a Second State</p>
<p>Bet365 may be a leading company in Europe but is just starting its US journey. The company’s betting products have been available in New Jersey for a while and will now launch in Colorado as well. The British operator secured a license earlier this year and will now launch in the state thanks to its deal with Century Casinos, a company that operates ten casinos across the USA.</p>
<p>Eligible gamblers will be able to access bet365’s critically-acclaimed sports betting offerings and place wagers on thousands of games across the top sports leagues in the world. Bet365 will also provide customers with exciting opportunities, parlay bonuses, wager boosts and payout offers. Players who choose to play with the British powerhouse will, moreover, be able to benefit from other features such as live sports streaming and cash-out options.</p>
<p>The Operator Continues to Expand Its Presence</p>
<p>A bet365 representative spoke about the launch in Colorado. He noted that the renowned operator is happy to launch in a second US jurisdiction and hopes that sports fans will enjoy playing with “the world’s favorite” online sports wagering company.</p>
<p>Bet365 is furthermore excited about the launch’s timing. The spokesperson noted that he is excited to see bet365 become available in Colorado ahead of the new National Football League season. The beloved sports event kicks in next week and will provide NFL enthusiasts with many new memorable moments. Bet365 will, meanwhile, provide bettors with the opportunity to experience its market-leading in-play products and enjoy its “unrivaled new customer offer.”</p>
<p>Bet365 is famous for its engaging offerings and exciting promotions. The company hopes to become a key player in Colorado’s sports betting market.</p>
<p>Bet365 remains bullish on expanding its influence and engaging more sports fans worldwide. The company has operations in many regulated jurisdictions across several continents. The operator is one of the powerhouses in Europe and is a key player in many countries. Because of that, bet365 recently introduced live casino tables with Dutch-speaking croupiers, aiming to reinforce its foothold in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>A week ago, the British operator reinforced its team by naming the experienced Gareth Kennedy as head of partnerships. Kenedy has a long history with the company and was happy to assume responsibilities for the company’s relations with its partners.</p>
