<p>The Canadian streamer, whose real name is Félix Lengyel, was removed from the casino while visiting with his family to celebrate his birthday. He later took to X to share his experience.</p>
<p>According to his tweet, security personnel approached and dragged him out of the casino. The streamer pressed the casino’s security for an explanation. He then discovered he had been blacklisted from gambling anywhere in Québec.</p>

<p>The article also detailed a case of a local man influenced by xQc to gamble after seeing his online streams.</p>
<p>Enneric Chabot, a Quebec City resident, followed xQc for years. In 2021, he saw an episode of the streamer gambling on Stake.com. Chabot had allegedly never gambled before and decided to open an account on the gambling platform. Chabot developed a gambling problem and, after falling deeper into debt, filed for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Million Dollar Contract</p>
<p>Kick, partially owned by Stake.com, has proudly announced that it will spend big money to attract streaming talent. Several months ago, it backed up the claim when it signed xQc to a lucrative content agreement worth as much as $100 million.</p>
<p>The foundation of the nonexclusive agreement is a $70-million payday for xQc that can grow to at least $100M over two years if he meets certain milestones. The deal underscores the growing influence and value of top-tier content creators and highlights the intense competition among streaming platforms vying for exclusive partnerships.</p>
<p>The nonexclusivity of the agreement means that xQc can continue to deliver content through Amazon-owned Twitch as well. He reportedly makes a minimum of $3.4 million a year as a base salary, not including his sponsorship deals.</p>
