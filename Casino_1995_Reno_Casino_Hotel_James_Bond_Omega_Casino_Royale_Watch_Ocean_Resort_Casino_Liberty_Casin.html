<p>BetGames, a studio that focuses on developing innovative games for the betting and gaming verticals, has launched its very first proprietary crash game, Skyward, which will elevate the experience for partner operators who are interested in offering out-of-the-box experiences to their players.</p>
<p>Skyward is fast-paced and rewarding, and it offers captivating adventure for players who may or may not be familiar with the genre and the unique gameplay angle it invites. Specifically, BetGames prides itself on creating a product that offers an overall range of experiences that is engaging, simple and yet intent and decision-driven.</p>
<p>Players participate by placing a bet, seeing a plane take off, and deciding when to abandon the plane lest it crashes, and their stakes are lost. The farther out a plane soars, the bigger the stake’s multiplier becomes, leading to potentially significant wins for the players.</p>
<p>The maximum multiplier that can be won this way is 100,000x, which is a solid payday. BetGames CPO Ian Catchick commented on the fresh rollout and said that the company was happy to introduce Skyward as part of the company’s portfolio, and particularly following the success of Instant Lucky 7, another acclaimed game by the company which has enjoyed a strong reception by gaming audiences.</p>
<p>"With the hugely popular high-frequency aircraft-themed crash game concept, Skyward brings a new level of excitement and engagement to our extensive portfolio of pre-existing games," Catchick added.</p>
<p>Catchick confirmed that BetGames is fully committed to delivering innovative and worthwhile experiences for gaming audiences. The company has also been known for a series of innovative products that span the full range of the gambling expeirence.</p>
<p>Its Twain Sport product has already been driving a steady revenue for partners, and the new crash game would be no different, the company believes. Apart from this, BetGames has also pioneered a range of experiences, such as Dice Duel, Wheel of Fortune, Lucky 5, Lucky 6 Speedy 7, 6+ Poker, War of Bets, and others.</p>
<p>A big focus of the company’s efforts lies in creating live gaming experiences, but evidently, BetGames’ reach has been growing well across this and other exciting verticals.</p>
