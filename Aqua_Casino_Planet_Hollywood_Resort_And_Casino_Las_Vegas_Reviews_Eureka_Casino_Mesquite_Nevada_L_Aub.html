    <h1>Aqua Casino Planet Hollywood Resort And Casino Las Vegas Reviews Eureka Casino Mesquite Nevada L Aub</h1>

<p>10/22/2019. (00.00 - approximately) I saw a new casino, deposited 1000 rubles with a 200% bonus, talked with the operator about the conditions (bet no higher than 350 rubles, winnings are unlimited, slots that cannot be played do not open). I played a wager x50 deposit + bonus and 120.000 tr remained on the balance I bet on the conclusion of 6.00 am going to work. In the evening I read the mail, you need verification (passport, qiwi, selfie with the site) I send it. 10/23/2019 (12.00) add. documents (utilities), send. 10.24.2019 on the payment should be visible your full name and address, or a check or other document with your address and payment. I explain that there are no such documents, and this is not possible with communal services because the owner of the house is not me (therefore, I am sending the communal apartment with the name of my mother and my address, an extract from the house book, which shows that my mother and I are registered in this house, and a check for Internet payment with kiwi, kiwi was verified with my name and patronymic in it + lk from the Internet, and payment screen). 10.24.2019 write that it is not enough to send where your address and your name are no later than 3 months. I write I do not have such documents it is impossible. 10/25/2019 There is no answer from the financial department of the casino, I call at 19.00 on the hot line and ask to hurry the fin. department, explaining that they delay me in verifying documents that I don’t have (they tell me the financial department works until 6:00 p.m .; Sat, Sun. weekend) after talking on my account, all the standing funds on the withdrawal are returned, while I played in Victorius, I was thrown out and the account was written blocked. I call and write in support, the answer is that you were blocked by fin. department (which by the way works until 18.00 but blocks at 19.00) and only he can give you an answer about blocking, so wait for blocking. a minute later letters came that payments were canceled, and a payment of $ 1000 was requested (my deposit, as I understand it). I’m all confused about this, there’s no explanation for the ban, they don’t get in touch with me, they write only templates, they will contact you shortly. Contacted closer to midnight, and they showed the winnings were canceled in the amount of 117k, and your deposit was returned (although nothing was returned), and they didn’t deposit and they should win, I barely washed the indelible wager after spending the whole night and effort to verify. unban, and withdraw no win, no bonus conditions are not violated not 1. Just thrown.</p>
