<p>Betting operator Parx Interactive has signed deals with two professional sports players. As a result, the retired National Football League veteran Rich Gannon and the Ultimate Fighting Championship champion Eddie Alvarez will join Parx Interactive as brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>Parx Interactive Gets Two Sports Stars as Brand Ambassadors</p>
<p>As brand ambassadors, Gannon and Alvarez will serve as figureheads that help raise the betting operator’s image through various appearances and activations during certain events. They will also propagate Parx Interactive’s brand through social media.</p>
<p>Matthew Cullen, senior vice president of iGaming and sports for Parx Interactive, revealed that his company is delighted to work with the two professional sports athletes. Cullen believes that Gannon and Alvarez are a perfect addition to the company that will help to spread Parx’s brand name as sports, sports betting and social media platforms continue to intertwine.</p>
<p>“We are committed to being at the leading edge of this convergence to engage sports fans and provide them with the content they demand from the names they respect,” Cullen stated.</p>
<p>As a part of Parx Interactive’s brand ambassador squad, Gannon and Alvarez join other famous celebrities such as the sportscaster and analyst Dei Lynam, the radio caster Sam Wilson and radio personality Natalie Egenolf who all joined Parx this year. The ambassador team will now have the responsible task of popularizing Parx’ brand.</p>
<p>Parx Interactive’s Expansion Efforts</p>
<p>Parx Interactive has been quite active in its efforts to expand and popularize the company. One of the operator’s most notable recent feats was its partnership with the Gun Lake Casino in Michigan that resulted in Parx launching its online gambling app in the state.</p>
<p>Later the Michigan Gaming Control Board approved Parx Interactive and its local partners, the Gun Lake Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan, for a sports betting license, increasing the offerings of the operator in the state.</p>
<p>Additionally, Parx partnered with the specialized paying platform Paysafe in order to ensure Michigan players the best and safest betting experience. Through this partnership, players can withdraw their prizes and send payouts to their banks by using Skrill in real-time. Alternatively, players can use the automated clearing house option.</p>
<p>Cullen was excited by the Paysafe addition. Parx believes that the addition of such a state-of-the-art paying option will boost the appeal of the operator’s gambling offerings and will attract more customers.</p>
<p>Finally, a few weeks ago Parx’s ownership company, Greenwood Gaming, and Entertainment inked a multi-year partnership contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL franchise just before the start of the competitive season.</p>
