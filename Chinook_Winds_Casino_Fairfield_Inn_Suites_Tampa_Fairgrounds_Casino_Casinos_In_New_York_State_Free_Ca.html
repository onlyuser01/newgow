<p>Information about Amatic casinos</p>
<p>Amatic is an Austrian casino game provider, which is smaller and a bit less known than the giants in the industry such as NetEnt or Microgaming. However, its games are definitely popular among players who know them from European brick-and-mortar casinos. And they are now available online, too.</p>
<p>This list of Amatic casinos contains all gaming sites that offer games from Amatic to their customers. Feel free to pick your favorite, and, if you are interested to learn more about this game provider, you can also read more about below.</p>

<p>More about Amatic and the company's history</p>
<p>Amatic (full name Amatic Industries) is an Austrian supplier of gaming products established in 1993. It has been operating as a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of gaming technology for land-based casinos ever since, so it's fair to say that the company has a long history. And it's a successful one, too.</p>
<p>It was founded by Reinhold Bauer, who has already had a lot of experience in the gambling industry. He decided to utilize his knowledge and started a new company, which was then known as Amatic Trading. The company specialized in producing slot machine games and cabinets for land-based casinos, which is still one of the cores of its business today.</p>
<p>The name of the company was later changed to Amatic Industries, and it kept on growing. Amatic developed a collection of roulette games for brick-and-mortar casinos and kept improving their line of slot machines and other products designed for land-based gambling.</p>
<p>Apart from regular standalone cabinets, Amatic also developed their own video lottery terminals (VLT). VLTs might look the same to players from the outside, but they function differently to normal cabinets. VLTs are connected to a central game server, which is where the game logic is stored. The VLT cabinets only display the results of the game to the player, but all operations are performed outside of them. This allows controlling multiple locations at once and managing them with a central management system.</p>
<p>Thanks to the constant improvement, Amatic remains one of the top suppliers of games, slot machine cabinets, video lottery terminals and other solutions for brick-and-mortar gambling establishments, especially popular in European countries.</p>
<p>Amanet â€“ Amatic's online gaming division</p>
<p>Following the success in land-based gambling, Amatic has decided to branch out to the online gambling world and created its online gambling division known as Amanet. This included first and foremost migrating the company's game selection, at least the most popular titles (43 games were launched at once) to the online environment, so that players can enjoy them online.</p>
<p>This all happened in 2011, which is when at least some online casinos started offering titles from Amatic to their customers. Luckily, the company has realized that Flash is no longer the way to go, so all Amatic games are available in HTML5 and can be played on all devices.</p>
<p>In addition, all games are available in multiple languages and have been tested in land-based casinos prior to being introduced to those that operate online. That means both players and casinos can be sure that everything works as intended.</p>
<p>However, Amanet doesn't just offer games to online casinos. The company has also created an online casino back office system, which provides operators with analytical and marketing tools, as well as other functionality needed to run an online gambling site.</p>
<p>Games from Amatic</p>
<p>Given the company's history, it's understandable that its games are mostly slots with a timeless, classical style. Many of them are classical 5-reel slots with multiple winlines, which is undoubtedly a tried-and-tested game design popular among players. Amatic games share similar features with games from other popular European game providers such as Novomatic or EGT.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of more innovative titles, you might want to look elsewhere. That being said, Amatic has already introduced some games which branch out of the truly classic slot design. Some games include the so-called all-ways payout system instead of the classic fixed number of winlines.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular titles by Amatic are:</p>
<p>Book of Fortune</p>
<p>Diamond Monkey</p>
<p>All Ways Fruit</p>
<p>Bells on Fire</p>
<p>Dragon's Pearl</p>
<p>It's fair to say that Amatic games are not breaking any records in terms of popularity in online casinos, but they definitely have their place in the online gambling world and are sought after by European players who want to play games which they've already played in land-based venues.</p>
