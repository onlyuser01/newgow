<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I get the feeling that you are the casino representative. That's good that you try to help out the player, but I also feel that you are not quite familiar with the forum and its feature yet. That's all right, I'm here to help you. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>This forum doesn't support personal messages, so it would be good if you advise the player on which email address they are supposed to send you their credentials, please.</p>
<p>Another point is that your account has to be manually synced with the brand/brands you wish to represent here, please mind the rules:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/forum/bonuses-and-promotions/rules-for-casino-representatives-adding-promotions</p>
<p>Among the rest:</p>
<p>2) Your forum account needs to be manually synched with casino brands that you represent. You need to send us names of these brands and your forum username (or e-mail address) to forum(at)casino.guru. Then we'll be able to synch your forum account with all the casino brands. You also need to contact us from an official casino address or from an e-mail address of a company that is responsible for marketing agenda in given casino brands.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me at radka@casino.guru</p>
<p>If you need further help, just mention that in the email, please ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Stay well!</p>
