<p>Global sports betting and entertainment brand Betway has taken another dive into African soccer through a new</p>
<p>The company, which has been expanding its presence in the African region, has extended its existing collaboration with the Ghana Football Association in support of the country’s top women’s soccer competition, the Premier League.</p>
<p>Betway Strengthens Positions in Ghana Sports Market</p>
<p>Betway is going to maintain a principal development partner for the topflight event, while also ensuring that it grows awareness for its brand and products in the country. Betway country manager Kwabena Oppong Nkrumah welcomed the opportunity to see the sportsbook brand continue to collaborate with the Football Association. Nkrumah added:</p>
<p>Through our sports sponsorships, we have demonstrated our commitment to the development of sports since our inception in Ghana. Our goal is to help grow our women’s football in Ghana and develop an interest in the game. Betway country manager Kwabena Oppong Nkrumah</p>
<p>Nkrumah said that Betway will continue to seek the empowerment of women’s soccer in the country and beyond, including the administration, coaches, and actual players. Betway is building upon its mentoring program from last year and hoping to bring new opportunities for sports in the country while also positioning its betting brand firmly.</p>
<p>GFA general secretary prosper Harrison Addo was similarly pleased with the partnership and said that it was an important opportunity for the Women’s Premier League. He said that the collaboration between GFA and Betway will continue to result in strong improvement for the event and further develop and boost the competition.</p>
<p>Betway’s backing, Addo argued, will also help close any remaining gap between men’s and women’s soccer in Ghana. “The recent improvements in women’s football have started yielding great results,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Betway and Others Continue to Grow across the African Betting Market</p>
<p>In similar regional moves, Betway was able to secure a deal with the SA20, South Africa’s newest T20 cricket league. Betway and Twain Sport announced a similar groundbreaking deal for the African market, bringing more quality products to local consumers.</p>
<p>Potential in the sports and sports betting markets in Africa has been significant, so much that this year should see a surging interest among companies looking to expand their pull in the market. Sports Information Services completed a partnership with Jolibet, seeking to consolidate its presence in the region. MGA Games, a prominent iGaming company, has teamed up with Goat Interactive’s Premier Bet brand for the region.</p>
