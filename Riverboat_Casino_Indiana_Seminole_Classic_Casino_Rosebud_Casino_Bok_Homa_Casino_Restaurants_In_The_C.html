    <h1>Riverboat Casino Indiana Seminole Classic Casino Rosebud Casino Bok Homa Casino Restaurants In The C</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have made withdrawal on 19th September and still waiting for the transfer. Casino is advertising that withdrawal will take 4 working days and withdrawal is free of charge but that's not true. On 23rd September (after 4 days) they sent me email that that my withdrawal was processed and transfer will take 7 business days plus less processing fees. Whilst I made withdrawal on 19th there was information that withdrawal is free (I attached screenshot of withdrawal as a proof). 7 business days for withdrawl? These days transfer take 1-2 days. Why casino is holding withdrawal for 7 days?</p>
<p>I feel this is very unfair treatment because it takes 2 weeks to receive the withdrawal instead of 4 days as they stating in their terms and conditions and there are some hidden fees which there is no information of how much. Please can you help me get some answers. Is just me or its every their customer treated like that.</p>
