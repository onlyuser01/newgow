    <h1>Casino Pair Allegany Casino Play Casino Free Captain Jack Casino No Deposit Bonus Riverfront Casino</h1>

<p>I had a agent tell me on repeat the deposited funds are played first , no where in the terms does it state the bonus and the deposited funds are conjoined, if they were, the agent wouldn't have told me on repeat that I played thru my deposit , and then started to wager the bonus, that's why I didn't get the 2.8 mbtc , so then I guestioned if I played thru my deposit then how did I have funds in my account when I canceled the bonus , and had my deposit , they would tell me to hold for 5 to 10 minutes and just say the wager wasn't completed, but never did they just tell me the bonus and deposited funds are conjoined, they would say other wording, and I even had a agent tell me they would talk to there colleagues to add rules when I was explaining to them what my thoughts were, even told me that it is very confusing in there own words they told me that , as I continued to question it went from me playing my deposit to , I didn't play thru it that I canceled without wagering it , then try to sell me on giving me the bonus back , which was the 2.8mbtc, but had to wager it 36Ã— and my wagering was at 101 mbtc, but again told me in there own words , they would give bonus back " where I left off" so the wager was 15.75 mbtc originally and they tried to make it 101mbtc, then they took it away saying that they had to do the calculations manually, and instead of me starting "where I left off" they gave me 350 ubtc with 45 wager , so everything they have told me has either been changed or they backed tracked on, and again they made it very clear that the deposited funds are played first , but when I told them I didn't go below 350 ubtc so the funds would be mine , they would revert back to the bonus wasn't wagered, never telling me , bonusand deposit had to be wager very clearly they would say bonus , well bonus is 350 ubtc not 700 ubtc, no where in the terms does it say the deposited amount with bonus is wagered as 1 , as they told me they would talk to agents to add rules, so to me y'all were adding rules as this conversation was happening</p>
