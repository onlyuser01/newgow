<p>Slots Temple, an iGaming affiliate business that offers free slots tournaments resulting in real cash prizes, has notched a monumental achievement in the United Kingdom. The company has been cleared for launch by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), which will result in the company’s free-to-play products now being available on the market.</p>
<p>Slots Temple Makes Big Move into the UK Market</p>
<p>As a result, players who participate in the company’s slot tournaments for free can win real money. In order to participate in any of Slots Temple’s contests, players need to be at least 18 years of age. Players then must compete against others in an attempt to top the pecking order and claim the biggest prize.</p>
<p>Slots Temple has an ample choice of slot games that players may pick from with more than 10,000 dedicated slots. The bulk of these is developed by leading gaming studios, including Relax Gaming, Push Gaming, 4ThePLayer, and many others.</p>
<p>Players need not wager any of their own money to gain entry or compete for real money prizes. Slots Temple director Fraser Linkleter welcomed the opportunity to be launching in the UK market and what the long-term implications for business and players:</p>
<p>It’s always great to achieve an industry first, and we’re proud to be the first affiliate site to receive UKGC licensing. Licensees are held to high regulatory standards, and we believe this demonstrates our long-held commitment to social responsibility.</p>
<p>This license would bring more free play opportunities for players in the United Kingdom, Linkleter shared. Slots Temple is also open about its business model which depends on affiliation with iGaming brands.</p>
<p>Free Entries and Transparent Business Model at Slots Temple</p>
<p>The company explained that it lets players sign up to licensed online casinos and receive a commission on each successful referral. The base product, however, is available for free and there is no obligation to sign up for any casino to use the Slots Temple website, the company reminds.</p>
<p>Cash prizes for these free contests can go up to £5,000, making for particularly appealing targets for any casual and recreational player. Slots Temple is now set to launch a number of tournament series. There will be different categories, including Turbo and Risk Tournaments, with players having fixed balance but free to adjust their bet size in order to try and end up higher up on the leaderboard.</p>
