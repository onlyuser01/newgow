<p>The three new members who have experienced gambling harm firsthand will contribute to the work of the Lived Experience Council</p>
<p>Late in December 2022, GambleAware, the charity that is on a mission to help prevent problem gambling and ensure everyone is safe from gambling harm, announced the creation of its Lived Experience Council, which consists of people who were affected by problem gambling and seek to help others by raising awareness and participating in strategic long and short-term initiatives of the charity.</p>
<p>The Lived Experience Council, GambleAware said, would have a total of 12 members. Now, as reported by SBC, the Council saw the addition of three new members. While one member remains anonymous, the other two are Steve Ramsey, who has experience in collaborating with NHS Gambling Clinics, the Gambling Commission and is six years into recovery, as well as 25-year-old Megan Vanderson who has been in recovery from gambling harm since last year via the Gordon Moody’s residential treatment program for women.</p>
<p>Zoë Osmond, GambleAWare’s chief executive officer, spoke about the importance of the contributions of people with lived experience of gambling harm to the work of the charity. “I would like to extend a warm welcome to our new council members and look forward to working with them in our mission to prevent gambling harms and provide vital support to those who need it,” said Osmond in conclusion.</p>
<p>“It’s essential that the opinions of those with experience of gambling harms guide our work, to ensure we always have their needs in mind, and we are extremely grateful for the work the existing council has already done.“ Zoë Osmond, CEO at GambleAware</p>
<p>Lived Experience Council’s Chair Welcomes the New Members</p>
<p>Benjamin Howard, the Lived Experience Council’s chair, said that it is exciting to see the addition of three new members. “It is fantastic to be involved in the strategic development of the organization, and I’m excited to see how these new voices can add to great conversations we’re already having,” he said, explaining that it is significantly important for the council to have diverse opinions. This, Howard said, is imperative for the successful work of the Lived Experience Council. Finally, he addressed the broader mission GambleAware has to reduce problem gambling with the support of people with lived experience of gambling harm.</p>
<p>“As a young person who has experienced gambling related harms and addiction struggles first hand, I hope to become a voice to raise awareness of the stigma of gambling harms in young people and women.“ Megan Vanderson, member of GambleAware’s Lived Experience Council</p>
<p>Vanderson commented on the topic explaining that she is a person with lived experience of gambling harm and would like to help raise awareness of stigma related to gambling addiction. She expressed hope that she will continue her gambling recovery and share her story with others with the ultimate goal to make a change.</p>
