    <h1>Harrington Raceway Casino Eldorado Casino Shreveport Treasure Bay Casino Biloxi Ms Casinos In Ruidos</h1>

<p>Hello Jozef,</p>
<p>Below we will describe in detail all the points about the player after a detailed check with our partners.</p>
<p>The first account of SPORTWETTE2 player was registered on 26.03.2021 and was closed because of gaming addiction at the request of the player on the project burningbet.</p>
<p>After 11.09.2021 player creates on the project allreels login SPORTWETTE2, with other personal data as well as phone number, e-mail, address, etc.</p>
<p>Also on 12.09.2021 the player creates a login SPORTWETTER2 on the project burningbet, again with excellent registration data.</p>
<p>On 12.09.2021 the player SPORTWETTER2 on the project burningbet asked to close his account since he is gaming addiction. The account is closed within 24 hours according to the rules.</p>
<p>This data was provided to the partners to check on their part end close his account since he is gaming addiction problems.</p>
<p>Since the player entered different data everywhere when registering, trying to mislead everyone, time was allocated to find the player Risk Department.</p>
<p>2021-09-13 at 08:18 a.m. The Risk Department found a player with similar data and was shut down according to project regulations due to "game addiction".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the player made a deposit 2021-09-13 at 06:30 in the amount of 100eur.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the player was blocked due to gambling addiction, and all his winnings were canceled according to the regulations of the project.</p>
<p>In this situation, the Risk Department conducted a full check, the player was closed on all partner projects.</p>
<p>But since the player indicated everywhere different personal data in the shortest time to close it on all projects was not possible. But based on this situation, the player thus tried to mislead all projects, thereby obtaining benefits for himself by violating the rules of the project that he guarantees to indicate only valid data at registration.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the player on all projects was closed within 24 hours according to our project rules.</p>
<p>Moreover, the player disregarded the rules of the project, namely:</p>
<p>Also according to the rules of the project, the player is obliged not to open a new account. The Casino is not responsible for you opening a new account and any losses you may incur after opening a new account. We reserve the right to close any account that has been created in violation of these rules at any time.</p>
<p>The player is a scammer who tries to mislead every project and you also, unfortunately.</p>
<p>If necessary, we will provide all data to players, as well as personal data at the request of the licensing authority in confirmation that the player everywhere indicated false data in an attempt to circumvent our system of blocking players with a gambling addiction.</p>
