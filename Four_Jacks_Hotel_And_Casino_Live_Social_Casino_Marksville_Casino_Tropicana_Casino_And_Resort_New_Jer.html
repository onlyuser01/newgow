<p>The Seminole Tribe's move is anticipated to create over 1,000 new jobs and significantly boost tourism and revenue for the state</p>
<p>The Seminole Tribe of Florida has announced its plans to introduce in-person sports betting, craps, and roulette at its Seminole Hard Rock casinos across the state starting in December. The decision follows a recent ruling from the US Supreme Court, upholding the Seminole Compact, a 2021 agreement between the tribe and the state of Florida, allowing the tribe to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>The Online Launch of Sports Betting Remains Uncertain</p>
<p>The Seminole Tribe’s casinos in Hollywood and Coconut Creek will kick off the in-person sports betting festivities on December 7, with additional locations joining the fray on December 8 and December 11, reported the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. The announcement has generated excitement among gambling enthusiasts, but questions linger about the potential launch of online sports betting, which the tribe has yet to confirm.</p>
<p>The legal battle surrounding the Seminole Compact has been complex. The US Supreme Court’s recent decision not to block the 2021 deal marked a significant victory for the Seminole Tribe. The compact allowed for sports betting statewide, but the tribe is opting for a more measured approach by initially introducing in-person betting at its facilities. This cautious approach aims to avoid legal challenges, especially from opponents like West Flagler Associates and Bonita-Fort Myers Corp., who are planning to appeal the case to the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Legal Dilemmas Surround Seminole Tribe’s Online Betting Strategy</p>
<p>While the Seminole Tribe’s compact includes provisions for online sports betting, the tribe has not provided any details about its online gambling plans. The agreement stipulates that bets placed using mobile apps or electronic devices will be exclusively conducted by the tribe, provided the servers are located on tribal land. This aspect remains a point of contention among legal experts and gambling operators.</p>
<p>The Seminole Tribe has opted not to launch its sports betting platform, the Hard Rock Bet mobile application. Despite having legal authorization, the Tribe is exercising caution, wary of potential risks associated with an early platform rollout.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s recent ruling has stirred debates about the wider implications of the case. Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concerns about the compact’s alignment with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, emphasizing issues related to equal legal protection. Simultaneously, during the legal battle over the Seminole Tribe of Florida’s exclusive sports betting compact, US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar defended the agreement, stating that it adhered to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). She clarified that IGRA does not impose restrictions on gaming compacts concerning gaming activities conducted on non-tribal lands.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding online sports betting, the Seminole Tribe’s decision to launch in-person betting marks a significant milestone. The tribe’s move aligns with the trend toward legalized sports betting, as witnessed in 35 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</p>
