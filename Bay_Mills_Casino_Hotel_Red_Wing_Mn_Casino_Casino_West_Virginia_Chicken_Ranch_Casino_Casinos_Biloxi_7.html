    <h1>Bay Mills Casino Hotel Red Wing Mn Casino Casino West Virginia Chicken Ranch Casino Casinos Biloxi 7</h1>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>so i joined to 7bit casino on 26th of September. Used no deposit bonus (i get 877trx from free spins). I waggered this two days later. After I waggered money was cut off from about 5000-6000trx to about 650. That was sad but of course, I understandâ€¦</p>
<p>i made deposit 37.2trx and wanted withdraw money but then I find out that I can withdraw money from 1100 trx. I didnt have time for play so I left this account. I came back today (1.10.2023), won a little bit and made withdrawal request of 2300 trx. It was discarded and the reason is that their system has discovered that I have duplicate account. Well.. its my first account. Nobody use my laptop or wifi. So its not true.</p>
<p>for my question about evidence on that Ive got only question like this:</p>
<p>"Dear Player,</p>

<p>so yeah, they can always said that youve got duplicate account, STEEL your money and move on.</p>
<p>Its not a big money but still, its funny and disgusting.</p>
<p>by the way, after my deposit I get 50 free spins and this bonus is still on my account. If ive got duplicate account and cant use bonuses, why they dont cancell them? Are they waiting my play? Great, its better steel your players winngins not cancell bonuses before they start playðŸ¤£</p>
