<p>The multi-year partnership with Boot Hill Casino &amp; Resort opens the way of the gaming company to its 14th state.</p>
<p>Bally’s to Attract Customers from Nearby States Too</p>
<p>US iGaming company Bally’s Corporation has inked a multi-year partnership with Boot Hill Casino &amp; Resort, located in Dodge City, Kansas. The deal brings the betting operator to its 14th location in the USA, after the states of Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, Nevada, Philadelphia, Rhode Island, and Virginia.</p>
<p>Sports betting regulation is still pending in Kansas, but once the industry is launched, Boot Hill Casino will provide its customers with access to Bally’s mobile sportsbook Bally Bet. Boot Hill Casino operates as a manager on behalf of the Kansas Lottery, which owns and operates all types of gaming in the state. Hence, the law requires Bally’s to transfer its mobile sportsbook elements to the lottery.</p>
<p>In addition, Bally’s Corporation will collaborate with media operator Sinclair Broadcast, which is expected to result in more sports enthusiasts from nearby states. The partnership with Sinclair Broadcast will allow Bally’s to integrate content into its portfolio of 19 regional sports networks.</p>
<p>Clark Stewart, chief executive officer of Boot Hill Casino &amp; Resort, highlighted Bally’s robust growth and excellent operating track record. Stewart expressed his confidence that Bally’s rich portfolio of online sports betting solutions available at Boot Hill Casino will be extremely beneficial for Kansas sports fans.</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited to work with Boot Hill Casino &amp; Resort in Kansas. This relationship, which marks the 14th state in which customers can access our omnichannel platform, provides a significant opportunity for Bally’s to enter into yet another attractive mobile sports betting market.” George Papanier, president and chief executive officer of Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>Bally’s Signs Key Acquisition Deals in June</p>
<p>In the beginning of June, Bally’s Corporation finalized its acquisition of the Tropicana Evansville casino operations from Caesars Entertainment. The deal also gives Bally’s the rights to the Evansville operations’ sports betting and iGaming skins, which will expose the company to the expanding Indiana gaming market. The transaction stands at $140 million.</p>
<p>In June, Bally’s completed another major deal with the acquisition of gaming technology supplier Bet.Works for $125 million. Bet.Works is a US-based sports betting platform, which provides services to operators in New Jersey, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado. The deal includes Bet.Works’ proprietary technology stack and turnkey solutions, including marketing, operations, customer service, risk management, and compliance.</p>
