<p>Haha this is what GamingCuracao sent to me today (their regulator). I am accused of using VPN (which I have) but when you use a VPN Suprabets website doesn't open at all. I can make a video of that. I told then that they should give me all IP logs. They are all from Slovenia. And I am accused of using Martingale strategy. Is this illegal? Hahahaha what a scam this is. Both GamingCuracao and Suprabets are a scam. I will never use casinos with such "licences". Also BTW my winnings were not part of Martingale strategy. I made a baccarat bet for 400€ and for 400€ and then for 1200 € lol. Mainly I used my mobile phone cellular data and occasionaly my regular desktop computer. I tried again to open Suprabets website and it does NOT open at all. I can make a video of that.</p>
<p>And this martingale strategy...even if it is illegal there I lost money with it. I won 2400€ when I didn't use it. So what a freakin scam this is. Both regulator and Suprabets go hand in hand. This shit is regulated only in name as www.thepogg.com says it</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>After careful analysis with the operator we detected that you have used a VPN, which is not allowed due to well know reasons (player that were banned, multiple accounts, forging identity, etc )</p>
<p>Your country is open to play on their site, so no proxy/vpn was needed.</p>
<p>On top of the VPN we see that you used a technique they warn players that is not allowed called: Martingale.</p>
<p>Because of technical limitations they cannot stop a player from using Martingale strategy and a player might state that he/she did not read the terms.</p>
<p>So usually they pay the winnings and warn the player he/she cannot continue with the strategy and will be blocked if he/she continues to apply it.</p>
<p>On this case seeing you were using a VPN which limits their capability of detecting linked accounts or multiple accounts, you might have been warned already about this.</p>
<p>Looking closer, you seem to be fully aware that you should not use Martingale, because you were playing in several games with similar RTP to roulette like baccarat.</p>
<p>And on these 2 games, you were playing in different versions of it ( Speed Baccarat A, Speed Baccarat B | Turkish Roulette, Auto-Roulette VIP MOB)</p>
<p>And on top of this not making clean doubles like 1-&gt;2-&gt;4, but near double bets (6-&gt;15 or 2.9 -&gt; 6.05 )</p>
<p>So to recap, VPN by itself is completely not allowed, but all this also clearly indicates you knows that martingale is not accepted by their casino and were possibly warned in another account and you were trying to bypass and circumvent the system by using a VPN and mixing several games and making near-double bets .</p>
<p>They made the decision to close your account for these reasons and according to the terms your winnings can be voided if this is suspected.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
