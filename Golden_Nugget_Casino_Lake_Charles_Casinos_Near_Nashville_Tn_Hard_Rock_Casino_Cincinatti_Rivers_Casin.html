    <h1>Golden Nugget Casino Lake Charles Casinos Near Nashville Tn Hard Rock Casino Cincinatti Rivers Casin</h1>

<p>The innovative, award-winning, mobile-first online gambling operator, Casumo, expanded its global reach by entering a new jurisdiction. The company headquartered in Malta unveiled Monday that it expanded its presence to Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>Garry McGibbon, Casumo's VP of Commercial, commented in a statement saying that the company is thrilled to introduce its services in Ontario. Moreover, he acknowledged that Casumo is among the first operators to secure a license in Ontario. This, according to McGibbon demonstrates the casino's leading technology and team expertise. In conclusion, McGibbon said: "We're excited to get going with our plans to bring Casumo magic to the fingertips of players all across Ontario."</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent entry into Canada's most populous province, Casumo can now offer its leading services to customers in the state. As a result, players in the province can enjoy Casumo's leading portfolio including table, card games and slots.</p>
<p>What's more, customers in Ontario will have the chance to experience Casumo's leading live dealer games such as live blackjack, live roulette, live baccarat and more leading live casino titles. Besides Android and iOS devices, Casumo can be accessed via desktop devices as well.</p>
<p>Casumo's content is separated into four main categories such as online casino slot games, casino table games, Slingo games and casino game shows. The operator offers a rich portfolio of content from leading developers such as Pragmatic Play, Evolution Gaming and NetEnt among other proven iGaming industry leaders.</p>
<p>Currently, Casumo offers unique experiences and entertainment via innovative technology through its brands Casumo, Casino Secret, Dunder and Kazoom Casino. Offering mobile-first online gaming solutions, the company also supports safe casino entertainment. Besides casino products, Casumo offers sportsbooks as well.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Casumo is licensed by the gambling regulator in Malta, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). Although Europe is the main market for the company, it continues to expand its reach to new jurisdictions. Besides Canada, the company has a well-established presence in key European markets such as Germany, Sweden, Spain, the UK and more.</p>
<p>It was back in April this year when Ontario launched its online regulated gambling market. Despite the opening of the market, to launch their services in the province, operators needed to secure a license from the gambling regulator in Ontario, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).</p>
<p>Considering that Ontario is Canada's most populous province, many leading operators secured licenses early. Major industry players such as FanDuel, PointsBet, Rush Street Interactive and bet365 were among the first to secure online gambling licenses. Now, Casumo further expands the list of licensees in the province.</p>
