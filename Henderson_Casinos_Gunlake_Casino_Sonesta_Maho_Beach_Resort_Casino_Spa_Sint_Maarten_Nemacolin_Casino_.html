<p>The fast-growing business-to-business (B2B) provider of leading gaming solutions and content, REEVO, announced it forged a new partnership with Evolution Group's premium provider of casino games, Red Tiger. The new deal, lauded as a strategic collaboration, is expected to bring benefits to the two companies.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Red Tiger will significantly expand the reach of its leading content, delivering new experiences to new players and operators around the world. At the same time, the partnership will help elevate REEVO's position as a provider of premium gambling content.</p>
<p>Per the new deal, the extensive portfolio of titles provided by Red Tiger will become available for REEVO's operator partners. The company currently offers table games, slots and other casino-style games that stand out with unique features. Those games will be integrated into REEVO's platform and this way engage with new audiences around the world.</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO's Head of Sales, shared her excitement about the partnership in a statement saying: "We are delighted to partner with Red Tiger, a provider known for their exceptional games and innovation." She explained that this partnership complements the company's goal of delivering immersive and engaging content.</p>
<p>Finally, Poola said: "By integrating Red Tiger's impressive portfolio into our platform, we are confident that we will exceed the expectations of our operator partners and elevate their success in the dynamic iGaming industry."</p>
<p>The collaboration with Red Tiger comes on the heels of another deal announced by REEVO recently. Earlier this month, the company forged a partnership with Thunderkick, a fast-growing independent slots studio. Under the terms of that content aggregation deal, the developer's complete collection of slots would be integrated into REEVO's aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Again in May, REEVO signed a partnership with Spinoro, a fast-growing provider of solutions for the online gambling vertical. Thanks to that deal, REEVO expanded further the reach of its games, allowing Spinoro's Game Hub to tap into a portfolio of popular games.</p>
<p>REEVO's latest deal with Red Tiger isn't surprising, considering that the two companies share a similar vision for offering supreme experiences for their partners and customers. By teaming up with REEVO, the developer will be able to showcase its content to more customers, delivering new games.</p>
<p>Besides teaming up with studios and iGaming developers, REEVO constantly grows its portfolio of content by developing its own games. By now, the company offers a range of content that can be integrated via a single API.</p>
