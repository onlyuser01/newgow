    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Tulsa Casino In Ga Casino In Tennessee Belterra Casino Resort Casino Bonus Oh</h1>

<p>I started playing at cbet a while ago. Everything was going well. As time went on, as expected, I started losing money.</p>
<p>The last deposit I made (200 usdt) was for a bonus which gave me a certain wager. After completing the wager, I finished with the bonus.</p>
<p>The problem began when I wanted to withdraw the available balance in my account, originally 3800usdt. Suddenly, I was informed that I couldn't withdraw due to something known as "turnover". After some research, I discovered that the turnover is a security method used by the casino to prevent fraud and money laundering, among other things. However, none of these cases applied to me. Moreover, the turnover amount was excessively high, unreasonably so compared to my deposits. I had deposited a total of 2000usdt in the past, and while the maximum turnover usually tends to be double your total deposits (4000usdt), mine was a staggering 15000usdt.</p>
<p>I contacted support again and again to try and resolve the issue of my high turnover, which, to begin with, shouldn't even have been there. But all I managed to do was have it increase, despite not placing any more bets or making any more deposits.</p>
<p>I attempted to complete the turnover, and in doing so, I spent 300 usdt on the casino's slot games to see if anything would change. However, my turnover only escalated.</p>
<p>I discussed the situation with a colleague who suggested that I pretend to have a gambling addiction. That way, they would be forced to close my account and pay me the funds that were left within it.</p>
<p>That's how I ended up contacting their support through the chat feature on their website and pretended to be addicted to gambling. They then proceeded to block my account and contacted me via email.</p>
<p>The first email I received asked me to log in and withdraw my money.</p>
<p>When I logged in again, the turnover was still there. I complained that I couldn't withdraw my money, and I also couldn't complete the turnover as I had been blocked for addiction.</p>
<p>I asked them to unblock my account and assured them that I wasn't an addict and was in a position to gamble responsibly. However, they decided to keep my money and permanently block me. Currently, I am not receiving any responses from them via the website's chat feature or email.</p>
<p>I'm left with a blocked account containing 3500 usdt and no response.</p>
<p>I've been considering legal action, but honestly, I don't know how to go about it.</p>
<p>What can I do? Can anyone help?</p>
