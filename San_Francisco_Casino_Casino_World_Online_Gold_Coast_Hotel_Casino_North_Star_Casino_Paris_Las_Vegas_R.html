<p>Arsenal have a chance to increase the points difference between them and Manchester City to five points. For that to happen, they need to beat Everton on Wednesday, March 1, 2023</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Everton duels are usually very fun to watch. We expect the same this time as both teams are hungry for points. The Gunners need them to get away from Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table. The Toffees are desperate for points in order to get away from the relegation zone.</p>

<p>Arsenal Is Determined to Win on Wednesday</p>
<p>The Gunners are 18-3-3 this season, collecting 57 points in 24 EPL games. Two of their three league losses happened within the last five rounds. One of those was a loss to Everton. In Sean Dyches’ first game as the Everton coach, the Toffees beat the Gunners 1-0 in Liverpool, even though the visitors from London were way better in that game.</p>
<p>Some three weeks later, the Gunners have a chance to get a payback. But it’s not just about revenge; Mikel Arteta’s men need to win this game to solidify their position at the top of the Prem. Right now, they are just two points ahead of Man City, but they got one game in hand.</p>
<p>If they beat Everton, they’re going to create a five-point gap between them and the reigning champions. This seems like a very strong motivation for each of their players to play their best soccer on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Everton’s Relegation Struggles Continue</p>
<p>There are only six Premier League teams that have never been relegated from the English top flight. That might change this season if Everton don’t get away from the relegation zone. At the moment, they’re in the danger zone, sitting in the No. 18 position with a 5-6-13 record (21 points).</p>
<p>The bad news is that they got the same number of points as the team just behind them (Bournemouth), as well as just three more than the bottom-placed team (Southampton). What this means is that they could drop down even further in the near future.</p>
<p>The good news, however, is that they’re not far behind those teams from the safe zone. For instance, they only have one point fewer than Leeds, two points fewer than West Ham, and three fewer than Wolves and Leicester City.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Everton Prediction</p>
<p>Since Sean Dyche has taken over Everton, this team is 2-0-2 in the Premier League with a score differential of 2-4. They don’t score a lot, but they also don’t concede a lot since he’s been their boss. We expect the same will be the case with this game. Arsenal will beat Everton, but we won’t see annihilation.</p>
<p>Picks: Arsenal to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
