    <h1>Casino In Orlando Florida Rivers Casino Pittsburgh Casino Drive Pittsburgh Pa Sandia Resort Casino C</h1>

<p>On 11/15/21 I tried to withdraw the amount of 150.00 dollars from my credit card. This withdrawal was canceled by the casino on the same day because they were not able to withdraw via credit cards (PAYED IN via CREDIT CARD) On 11/16/21 I then made a withdrawal request via my account. This payout was approved immediately and also appeared under Payouts in the transaction log. Also with transaction number. The money never arrived, or if it was actually transferred, it was sent back by my bank because my bank does not accept dollar transfers. So since 11/16/21 the money has been floating somewhere, but no longer appears in my casino account.</p>
<p>But it is strange and extremely worrying that an attempt was made to buy something in an online shop the next day with my credit card. My Bnak took good care and locked the CARD! After 3 days I got a new card with which I again deposited 20.00 at Zodiacbet, another attempt was made to withdraw money with this card to buy one. My card was blocked again and I was given a 3rd credit card. I now had the justified suspicion that someone from Zodiacbet was using my card here to make private purchases! Suspicion because these cards were not used anywhere else. So I paid a third time at 8:00 p.m. into Zodiacbet and lo and behold, an attempt was made again to buy 466.00 EIR using my card. I then shared that with Zodiacbet. That's a lot of stuff that Zodiacbet allows itself. The finance department stops responding and the chat, at least one certain Ivan no longer answers. Obviously it seems to be being cheated. wanted because I only paid with these credit cards at Zodiacbet and only used these credit cards at Zodiacbet.</p>
