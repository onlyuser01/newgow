<p>CT Interactive is a fast-growing online software provider that develops slot games catering to the iGaming sector. Founded more than a decade ago, in 2012, the company continues to grow and now offers more than 200 engaging HTML5 games, suitable for desktop, mobile and tablet devices.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, CT Interactive unveiled a new deal, allowing it to expand further the reach of its thrilling games. The iGaming developer confirmed that its exclusive content is currently live with BetFlag Italy's platform, bringing a plethora of popular casino-style games. As a result, BetFlag customers can now access quality games from CT Interactive such as Lucky Clover, 40 Treasures and Chili Fruits, among other fan-favorite games.</p>
<p>It was back in June 2012 when BetFlag started to operate in Italy. Since then, the online casino operator grew to become among the top 10 most popular operators in the country, offering a staggering portfolio of 5,000 games.</p>
<p>Laviero Saganeiti, BetFlag's Casino project manager, shared his excitement about the new content agreement with CT Interactive in a statement. "Our specialists are committed to providing their customers with a high-quality, interesting online gaming experience," he said. Finally, Saganeiti pointed out: "We are accomplishing our goals and reaching a larger audience thanks to our partners from CT Interactive."</p>
<p>Kiril Kirilov, CRM at CT Interactive, added that the company grew and expanded its presence in Italy amid increasing demand for its quality games. In conclusion, he pointed out: "We are proud that the local operators chose us as their partner."</p>
<p>The collaboration with BetFlag Italy comes after last month, CT Interactive expanded its partnership with Favbet. Under the terms of the agreement, Favbet strengthened its offering for customers in Croatia. That collaboration helped CT Interactive reach new customers.</p>
<p>Before that, back in June, the prominent developer and supplier of casino games expanded further its Latin American presence via an agreement with Betmexico. Per that agreement, CT Interactive agreed to supply its products to the operator, expanding further its Latin American and global footprint.</p>
<p>Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive's Head of Business Development EMEA, shared her excitement about the collaboration with BetFlag. "We are thrilled that our content is live with one of the top Italian operators," she said. "One of the reasons why our products are so popular in the region is because the Italian players love how diverse, modern, and exciting our products are," explained Tsankarska in conclusion.</p>
