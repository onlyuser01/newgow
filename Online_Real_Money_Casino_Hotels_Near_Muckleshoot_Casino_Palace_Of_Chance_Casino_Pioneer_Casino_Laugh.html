<p>Wazdan has released HalloWIN, a fresh network campaign just in time for the spooky season, alongside a much-anticipated Los Muertos sequel</p>
<p>In July, we informed you of three upcoming network promotions from Wazdan, all set to round off the final months of 2023. The list included the HalloWIN Drop network campaign ready for launch on October 23. Now, the day has come for the innovative provider of casino games to officially kickstart the eerie campaign backed by its award-winning promotional tool Mystery Drop.</p>
<p>Prize Pool of €2.5 Million</p>
<p>The promotion, which will end on November 19, comes with a mouth-watering prize pool of €2.5 million ($2.65 million) provided by the provider in full.</p>
<p>Speaking about HalloWIN, which is the studios’ “penultimate network promotion of the year,” chief commercial officer, Andrzej Hyla, said it would add to the excitement of the Day of the Dead celebrations by giving away cash prizes to lucky players across all of their slots.</p>
<p>Hyla also mentioned the use of their award-winning Mystery Drop tool which is expected to give back to their partners by increasing their rates of engagement and driving revenue.</p>
<p>Iconic Games Revamped</p>
<p>Wazdan has also hit the refresh button and revamped some of its most iconic titles to further support the exciting campaign.</p>
<p>The list includes top-performing games like Hot Slot: 777 Cash Out with Cash Out, Chance Level, and a Grand Jackpot prize, Sizzling Eggs with the Collect to Infinity feature, and 9 Coins with Cash Infinity and Hold the Jackpot bonus rounds. At the end of last month, Wazdan released the eco-friendly version of Hot Slot: 777 Cash Out.</p>
<p>The games have been given a Halloween makeover and they are ready to give players more “spine-tingling, special spooky” scares in their new editions.</p>
<p>The studio’s freshest batch of Halloween-themed games comes to once again prove Wazdan’s ongoing efforts to offer more heart-racing content for players while generating top results for their partners.</p>
<p>New Halloween Slot Released</p>
<p>Moreover, the studio that counts over 180 employees “passionate about games and fuelled by innovation and creativity” has also announced the launch of a sequel to one of its most haunting Hallowed-themed games, Los Muertos.</p>
<p>By embracing the iconic horror theme and embedding the Unique Gamble Feature that offers extended player sessions by doubling the rewards up to seven times in a row in Los Muertos II, Wazdan hopes to attract an even larger number of steady players.</p>
<p>The slot with three reels and five paylines comes with straightforward and engaging gameplay. It incorporates the Special symbol that exclusively pops up on low-value symbols for even more generous wins.</p>
<p>The available Volatility Levels let players customize their gameplay and choose from larger wins scored on occasion to smaller wins scored more frequently.</p>
<p>In May, Wazdan announced the three-month Breaks the Rules Mystery Drop campaign with a prize pool going over the $1 million mark.</p>
