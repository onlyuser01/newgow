<p>Light &amp; Wonder will propel the ambitious startup forward by distributing its content through the OpenGaming platform</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder has penned a new deal with the studio startup DreamSpin, adding its content to the OpenGaming aggregation platform. This is a big opportunity for DreamSpin which is ambitious on becoming a leading provider of slots.</p>
<p>DreamSpin is a brand-new studio founded by iGaming industry veterans FruitySlots and HideousSlots, two major slot streamers. The new company will leverage its founders’ experience to create bespoke content based on their own experience with the iGaming sector and the slots community.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, DreamSpin will inject its portfolio into the OpenGaming platform. As a result, Light &amp; Wonder will become the startup’s exclusive distributor. Operator partners of the OpenGaming platform will thus be able to incorporate slots by DreamSpin into their own offerings.</p>
<p>Thanks to the agreement with Light &amp; Wonder, DreamSpin will be able to quickly expand its global footprint, solidifying itself as a major newcomer to the sector.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder, on the other hand, will grow its OpenGaming platform thanks to the new integration. This move cements the company as one of the world’s leading iGaming ecosystems, Light &amp; Wonder noted. The supplier said that this highlights its continued commitment to the diversification of its content offering.</p>
<p>The deal also attests to Light &amp; Wonder’s positive attitude toward independent studios and its desire to help them boost their international reach.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Jumpstart DreamSpin</p>
<p>Representatives from the two companies praised the deal, highlighting its benefits to both parties. DreamSpin’s founder, Josh Green, said that his team loves turning its ideas and vision for thrilling gameplay into reality. He is therefore thankful to Light &amp; Wonder which will distribute DreamSpin’s passion projects.</p>
<p>It’s a pleasure to work closely with Light &amp; Wonder, the OpenGaming platform is the perfect fit to distribute our games, tapping into their extensive global reach. Josh Green, founder, DreamSpin</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Steve Mayes, Light &amp; Wonder’s digital partnerships director, emphasized the importance of streamers to the contemporary iGaming ecosystem and the influence they have on players. He praised DreamSpin’s founders for their venture, adding that Light &amp; Wonder is excited to support the startup studio.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to have DreamSpin on our platform, and we can’t wait to deliver their games to operators and players worldwide. Steve Mayes, digital partnerships director, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>In other news, Light &amp; Wonder just extended its licensing partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery Global Themed Entertainment, allowing it to develop more licensed titles.</p>
