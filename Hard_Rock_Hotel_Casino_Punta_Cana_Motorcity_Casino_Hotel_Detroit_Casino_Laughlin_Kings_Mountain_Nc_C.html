<p>Renato Moicano Plotting Another Finish</p>
<p>Born and raised in Brazil, Renato Moicano started his martial arts journey as a grappler. He got himself a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Alex Leleco. Apart from BJJ, Moicano also earned a black belt in Muay Thai.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2017, and he’s decided to become a part of the American Top Team, where he’s been training alongside such elite fighters as Jorge Masvidal, Bo Nickal, Dustin Poirier, and others. The result is that he’s become a well-rounded fighter with fantastic stamina.</p>
<p>Still, Moicano’s No. 1 strongest weapon remains grappling. He’s incredible on the floor, the evidence being that 10 of his 17 wins happened by submission.</p>
<p>Can Drew Dober Upset the Odds?</p>
<p>Drew Dober is seen as a +125 underdog in the UFC on ESPN+ 93 fight for several reasons. First of all, even though he’s a fantastic striker, he’s not superior to Moicano in this respect. Dober lands 4.58 significant strikes a minute, while Moicano’s number is 4.75.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Dober’s kicks and punches are more powerful, the proof being that he’s got 14 wins by KO/TKO in his portfolio. Some of those happened against some really tough guys like Bobby Green, Rafael Alves, and Terrance McKinney.</p>
<p>But can he do the same to Moicano? The Brazilian fighter did lose three fights by this method. Those losses happened against Rafael Fiziev, The Korean Zombie, and Jose Aldo. All of those guys are arguably better strikers than Dober. Nevertheless, the fact that three of Moicano’s five losses happened by this method certainly is something that’s giving Dober confidence ahead of Saturday’s fight.</p>
<p>Renato Moicano vs. Drew Dober Prediction</p>
<p>Renato Moicano is a better fighter than Drew Dober, but the American has a nuclear option in his fists. He definitely has what it takes to KO Moicano, but we think the Brazilian won’t let that happen.</p>
<p>He knows how to box and we’re sure he won’t let Dober land too many devastating strikes. He’ll prevent that by making a takedown and finishing the fight by submission.</p>
<p>Pick: Renato Moicano by submission</p>
