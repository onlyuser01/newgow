<p>Hawaii Cops Raid Illegal Gambling Operations</p>
<p>Illegal gaming rooms, drug operations, and massage parlors in Hawaii were raided by the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) on Wednesday in sweeping court-approved searches.</p>
<p>The enforcement activity, called “Operation Firestorm,” led to the arrests of four suspects on charges including second-degree electronic enticement of a minor, as well as drug and gambling offenses, according to Hawaii TV station KHON2.</p>
<p>Among the operations searched were three illegal game rooms in Nanakuli. The searches led to the seizure of 38 illegal gambling devices valued at about $300K, police said.</p>
<p>Police also seized about three ounces of suspected methamphetamine (meth) and more than 50 oxycodone pills.</p>
<p>More raids are expected to take place in the future.</p>
<p>Two Robberies at Mississippi Casinos</p>
<p>Sheriff’s deputies are searching for the bandits who took part in recent robberies of visitors to two Tunica, Miss., gaming properties.</p>
<p>At about 4 a.m. Sunday, a man tried to rob a patron in a restroom at the Gold Strike Resort &amp; Casino. The victim was struck on the head with a firearm.</p>
<p>The gun discharged and the victim suffered minor injuries, according to Tennessee TV station WREG. It appears no cash was stolen.</p>
<p>The Tunica County Sheriff’s Office is also investigating the armed holdup of a visitor by two men at the Horseshoe Tunica casino, located near the Gold Strike Casino, on April 23.</p>
<p>That incident also took place in the restroom and also occurred at about 4 a.m., WREG reported. One of the robbers aimed a gun at the victim and the bandits stole about $1,350 from his pockets.</p>
<p>The sheriff’s office has issued a warrant for Jernard Black, 33, of Tunica, in connection with the Horseshoe casino robbery.</p>
<p>Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Reports Swatting</p>
<p>New York State authorities are searching for the suspect or suspects who phoned in fake reports of a bomb and gunfire at the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort on May 4.</p>
<p>The Akwesasne, N.Y., complex was completely evacuated and searched by officers and a specially trained dog. No threats were found, and Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal police officers believe it was a case of swatting, which typically involves someone making a call to emergency service providers, especially police, and reporting a fake dangerous incident. In some cases, the caller is at the claimed scene of the incident and watches uniformed personnel arrive.</p>
<p>An initial investigation revealed the calls were made by someone outside the US.</p>
