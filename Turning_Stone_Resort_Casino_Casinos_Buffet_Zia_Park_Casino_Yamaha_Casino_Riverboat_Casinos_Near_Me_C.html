<p>Crown Resorts has received an official date for its Crown Sydney Casino opening with the beginning of gaming operations set for Monday, August 8, 2022. This comes after last month the New South Wales Liquor and Gambling Authority cleared the company for launch, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.</p>
<p>This marks an important victory for Crown Resorts, which was dragged into a regulatory battle that imperiled its licenses and operations as a gaming property in Australia. Originally, the hotel and hospitality operations at the Barangaroo venue began in January2020, but the gaming floor was delayed as the gambling watchdog continued to grill the company over its suitability to hold a license.</p>
<p>This effectively put the existence of the AU$2.2bn casino in question, but finally, a regulatory ruling allowed Crown Resorts to carry on. Despite finding it "unsuitable," the regulator argued that it would allow the company to start gaming operations while appointing a special monitoring commission of its own to guide the property on its journey back to suitability.</p>
<p>Regardless of the clouds that have gathered over the company, Crown Resorts is confident that it has a strong hand to play. The casino is opening a dedicated gaming space known as the "Crystal Room," and there will be 160 gaming tables and 70 electronic table games to commence operations. More will be added as operations pick up. Earlier this year, Crown began looking for croupiers and other gambling staff anticipating the launch.</p>
<p>The gaming floor is targeted at a high-end clientele with a big focus on premium and VIP gamers. This is where the second dedicated gaming space, the "Mahogany Room," comes in. Commenting on this achievement for the press, Crown Resorts CEO Simon McGrath said:</p>
<p>"The opening of our gaming operations at Crown Sydney is a defining moment for Crown, and the culmination of months of hard work from our dedicated team."</p>
<p>McGrath said that the entire team at Crown Sydney has been long preparing for the launching of casino operations. He assured that the staff was prepared to welcome all VIP members and their guests and said that players can expect to find a safe and responsible gambling environment at the property.</p>
<p>The executive stressed that in designing its gaming operations, Casino Resorts has opted for the highest levels of government compliance and assured that the company will do comprehensive checks to ensure that due diligence regarding players is on point. Last but not least, McGrath said that Crown Sydneyâ€™s interior and design set a new standard for luxury and elegance that is certainly going to appeal to customers.</p>
