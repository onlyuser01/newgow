<p>In 2012, Chelsea had a chance to win the FIFA Club World Cup, but Brazilian team Corinthians stopped the Blues in the final. Fast-forward to 2022, and Chelsea has another shot at the title. This time, Chelsea’s opponent is another team from Brazil – Palmeiras.</p>
<p>Are we going to see history repeat itself? Oddsmakers don’t think so. Instead, they think of Chelsea as the favorite, as you can see for yourself in the section below.</p>

<p>Chelsea Looking for Its First Title of the Year</p>
<p>It would be great for Chelsea to start the year by becoming the club champion of the world. The Blues just need to beat Palmeiras in the final for that to happen. They surely have the manpower to do so, but their coach Thomas Tuchel might decide to tell his boys to take it slowly.</p>
<p>As we saw in the semifinal game against Al-Hilal, Chelsea players might not be willing to give their utmost in this competition if it would mean risking injuries. There’s an obvious explanation for this – Chelsea has some really tough matches coming up in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>For example, by the end of February, the Londoners will have to play against Lille in the Champions League, as well as against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup.</p>
<p>Palmeiras Players are Pumped-Up for the Final</p>
<p>This is going to be the first final of the FIFA Club World Cup for Palmeiras. The Champions of South America got there after defeating the African champ, Al Ahly. It was 2-0 for the Brazilian team, which showed quality in literally all aspects of the game.</p>
<p>Palmeiras’ right-winger Dudu was the best player in the game, whom we saw score once and make one assist. He completely dominated his part of the pitch, creating chances for his team, as well as providing cover for the defense. In fact, all of Palmeiras’ midfielders did great in that match.</p>
<p>No surprise there as each of Palmeiras’ top 7 highest-valued players is playing in the center of the field. As a result, this team is very tough to play against – they defend with all they got and attack in packs.</p>
<p>That said, Chelsea isn’t going to have a field day on Saturday. Still, the player quality is on the side of the winners of the 2020-21 Champions League. If the Blues take their chances, they should be able to win.</p>
<p>Picks: Chelsea to Win; Under 2.5 Goals</p>
