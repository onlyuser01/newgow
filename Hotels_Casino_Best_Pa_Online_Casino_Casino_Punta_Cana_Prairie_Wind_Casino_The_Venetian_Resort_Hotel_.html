<p>Your captivating fishing expedition will take place over the nicely designed grid counting six reels and 2,304 pay ways.</p>
<p>Get the reels to spin and cross your fingers for the Big Catch feature that allows the reels to grow in size and expand up to five times the original size, resulting in as many as 5,625 pay ways.</p>
<p>Make sure you land a pair of Wilds on the first and second reels to activate the bonus round and wait for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth reels to expand.</p>
<p>Once the Big Catch feature is engaged, the fish will make an appearance. The Bass symbols can trigger money values paid out on top of the standard wins.</p>
<p>Insane Catch, Insane Spins, Mystery Bass &amp; Super Wheel</p>
<p>You might also want to keep a close eye on the Insane Catch symbol. Once they hit and trigger the Insane Catch bonus, you will receive between two and five Insane Spins.</p>
<p>During these special spins, reels one and two will blend and turn into a massive multiplier showcasing values of up to 10x. The rest of the symbols will then turn into independent reels displaying Mystery, Bass, and Insane Catch symbols.</p>
<p>Mystery symbols feature 2x to 5x multipliers while Bass symbols are paid out with the applied multiplier. The Insane Catch symbols will attract even more spins.</p>
<p>What you truly want to see popping is the “game-changing Super Wheel feature” that reunites the studio’s one-of-a-kind brand of slots with enticing action experiences in live casinos.</p>
<p>Trigger the feature to instantly travel from the lake to a live studio where you are allowed to spin the money wheel packing a plethora of prizes and three additional bonus features.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new release, the company’s chief executive officer, Stephan van den Oetelaar, described it as a “little Christmas gift” to thank fans for their ongoing support.</p>
<p>Last week, Stakelogic Live was given the green light to launch on the Greek gaming market. The announcement followed the September news regarding Stakelogic Live’s confirmed live casino Bonus Tool launch.</p>
