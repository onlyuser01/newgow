    <h1>Golden Nugget Lake Charles Casino Casino In Biloxi Mississippi Is Casino A True Story Hollywood Casi</h1>

<p>I'm having trouble with a withdrawal</p>
<p>・I first applied on November 17th and when I inquired because it was taking a while, I was told</p>
<p>"We have processed it on our end, so it might be a delay on the payment provider's side (VegaWallet)"</p>
<p>・I usually use VegaWallet and have never encountered such a problem, so I contacted Vega</p>
<p>"It was found that Oh My Spin has been using Vega without going through the proper procedures, so we have suspended its use. You cannot withdraw until the affiliate has completed the proper procedure" they replied.</p>
<p>・As a result, I was refunded because the proper procedure was not completed.</p>
<p>・I received a standard withdrawal cancellation email and was urged to change my withdrawal method</p>
<p>I wanted to switch to a bank transfer, but gave up and deposited again with JETON because the system allows deposits but not withdrawals.</p>
<p>・Because wagering requirements were applied to the deposit amount, I had to reduce my funds for no reason to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>After barely meeting the wagering requirements, I applied for withdrawal via JETON, the method I had used for depositing.</p>
<p>However, yet again, I received a withdrawal cancellation email and the balance was returned to my account.</p>
<p>At this point, I am consulting via email but cannot get any responses.</p>
<p>I have also inquired several times via live chat</p>
<p>However, the only reply I get is "we will escalate this to the finance department and email you", and nothing gets resolved.</p>
<p>Although Oh My Spin has a good reputation on Casino Guru, I find this issue to be malicious.</p>
<p>What should I do? I would appreciate any advice.</p>
