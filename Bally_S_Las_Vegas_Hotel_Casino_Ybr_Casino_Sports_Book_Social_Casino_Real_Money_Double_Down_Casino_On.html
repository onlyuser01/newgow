    <h1>Bally S Las Vegas Hotel Casino Ybr Casino Sports Book Social Casino Real Money Double Down Casino On</h1>

<p>Attatched you will find the month prior to the month in question. Its ironic there wasn't anything originally and now when I checked I see that the exact same coupon and the exact same money won on the coupon twice in my transaction history. Funny how that happened ...I also noticed that there were three total redemptions in my history as well and last night I couldn't seem to find them. Still the fact remains all coupons are approved or denied by the casino. So the casino allows people to redeem these even though it is against their terms and conditions and did deny other coupon attempts by the player. This shows me that I have the casinos approval to play this free chip without any fault of my own. So more or less if it is not allowed why would the casino approve these multiple free chips when if we were not allowed to play them we should have been denied like I had been several times during these attempts at redemption. So my problem is if the player is not allowed to redeem multiple coupons why does the casino approve them and set the player up to lose any winnings made from the coupons the casino sent to the player and also approved by the casino before they were even played by the player. Why were the duplicate coupon redemptions allowed when it will not work without the casino approving the bonus amount as a deposit and placing these winnings in the account when the player should have never been able to redeem the exact same coupon twice. I play at many other casinos and I know that if there is an attempt at multiple redemptions the coupon is denied just like this casino denied and approved what they apparently wanted too. Because per their terms and conditions that should have never happened because it would have been denied prior to redemption. When the code is entered into the redeem coupon area it should have told me that I would be unable to redeem because it had already been redeemed the max amount of allotments. If in fact it was....which at this point I know better. Apparently the casino will go above and beyond to let the player make a mistake that will cause any withdrawal attempt to be rejected. Then actually tell the player they have to lose the winnings down to under $5. Instead of removing the "unauthorized" balance from the player account....How is this at all fair to the player? The player is t</p>
<p>old more or less by the casino yes play on this free play we sent you but don't win or attempt to withdraw because it was what....practice? I would love to have this explained so I understand how this is at all fair to the player.</p>
