<p>May was a strong month for the land-based casinos in Denmark, judging by figures released by the regulator in the country. Overall, land-based casinogross gaming revenue (GGR) this May hit DKK 32m ($4.5m), according to data released by the Danish Gambling Authority on Monday. When compared to the DKK 10.8m ($1.5m) in GGR reported by brick-and-mortar casinos from the same period during May 2021, an increase of nearly 200% is observed.</p>
<p>While the result in May this year is good when compared to 2021, still, when compared to April, land-based GGR dipped slightly. In April this year, GGR for brick-and-mortar casinos in Denmark hit DKK 35m ($4.8m). Similarly, in March GGR for land-based casinos was DKK 34m ($4.7m), while in February it hit DKK 31m ($4.3m). Those results reaffirm that the Danish casinos are on their way to a financial rebound, after the economic impact brought by the pandemic in the last few years.</p>
<p>Similarly, GGR for gaming machines in Denmark also saw strong revenue in May this year. In total, gaming machines GGR this May hit DKK 108m ($15m). When compared to May 2021, when GGR for gaming machines halted at DKK 55m ($7.6m), an increase of 97% was observed.</p>
<p>What's more, based on the figures released by the regulator, May is the fourth month in a row with GGR for gaming machines surpassing DKK 100m ($13.8m). In April and March, gaming machines' GGR was DKK 110m ($15.2m), while in February GGR hit DKK 109m ($15.1m). Without any doubt, those results once again reaffirm the strong recovery of the land-based gambling industry in the country.</p>
<p>In contrast to the significant increase in GGR for land-based casino operations, online gambling GGR marked a slight decline this May. Online casino GGR in May hit DKK 245.6m ($34m). When compared to the online casino GGR from May 2021, a decrease of 0.4% was observed.</p>
<p>Regardless of the year-over-year decrease in May, the overall online casino GGR remains strong. When compared to April this year, online casino GGR increased by nearly 1.5%. Additionally, May marks the 18th month in a row with online casino GGR above DKK 200m ($27.7m).</p>
<p>Another decrease was observed in the GGR for betting operationsin Denmark during May. The activity generated DKK 185.5m ($25.7m), down 7.3% when compared to May last year.</p>
<p>When compared to April, betting GGR in May decreased by 16.6% from the DKK 222m ($30.7m). However, comparing the DKK 185.5m ($25.7m) in betting GGR from May to March, when GGR halted at DKK 155m ($21.5m), an increase of nearly 20% is observed.</p>
