    <h1>Coconut Creek Seminole Casino Hotels Close To Foxwoods Casino Borgata Casino Hotel Elk Valley Casino</h1>

<p>The problem is that the payment is not processed at all. On the contrary, it is being delayed and I am being stalled.</p>
<p>The payout was declined by the casino after 3 days without informing me. Now I get an error message that I can't even request a payout. â‚¬500 are on the player account. I can't even close my player account because of the balance.</p>
<p>So I asked for manual payout. Live support keeps saying something different. The payout is queued, although the funds are still in the player's account. How does it work? They didn't even want to give me the email of the responsible department. Then suddenly the finance department is closed.</p>
<p>Now I'm supposed to wait another 3 days until it's processed, plus the weekend comes on top. I'm just supposed to wait for the next excuses from the casino. What can I do for the provider's problems? I actually expect that my request will be processed immediately if I have fulfilled the conditions of the withdrawal of 3 days waiting time, but the casino is causing the problems.</p>
<p>For me the case is clear. The provider Rabidi NV consciously uses these means and procedures so that players just gamble away everything again. The provider would normally have to be on a blacklist so that every player is warned.</p>
