<p>New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick Warns Players About Sports Betting</p>

<p>New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick is arguably the greatest NFL coach in history. The 71-year-old is an eight-time Super Bowl champion, an NFL record, that includes six titles earned as head coach.</p>

The warning comes after several NFL players have incurred suspensions and fines for violating the league’s policy on sports gambling. (Image: CBS)</p>
<p>Belichick has mentored countless coaches, and those coaching offshoots might be smart to take a page out of his latest playbook when it comes to warning players about the perils of participating in sports betting. Following several cases involving NFL players gambling on sports and subsequent suspensions and fines levied against those who violated the league’s policy on gambling, Belichick reportedly sat down with his players to address the matter.</p>
<p>Bill Belichick actually talked about that [sports betting] in very large detail,” Patriots defensive lineman Deatrich Wise told reporters on Tuesday after the team’s meeting in Foxboro. “He always tells us what we need to do, what we need to stay away from. We had a whole meeting just about that. We do a good job of learning from coach Belichick.”</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the NFL confirmed that Indianapolis Colts cornerback Isaiah Rodgers is under investigation for violating the league’s gambling policy that mandates that referees, players, and team personnel refrain from betting on NFL games. The NFL also prohibits those individuals from wagering on all sports while on the premises of NFL facilities.</p>
<p>Rodgers is no stranger to Massachusetts, as he attended the University of Massachusetts where he played for the UMass Minutemen.</p>
<p>Legal Betting Prohibited</p>
<p>Legal sports betting began in Massachusetts in February at the state’s three commercial casinos, Encore Boston Harbor, MGM Springfield, and Plainridge Park. Online sports betting commenced in March. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission says more than $500 million a month has been wagered on sports in the commonwealth since online books went live.</p>
<p>Despite legal sports betting being available to Massachusetts residents and visitors over the age of 21, the NFL’s gambling policy prohibits players from betting on the NFL. They also must not gamble on sports while at an NFL stadium, team practice, or any other team or league-sanctioned event.</p>
<p>The NFL, the most bet on sport in the US, continues to slowly ease its opposition to the US gaming and sports betting industries. After years of unsuccessful lobbying against state and federal efforts to repeal sports betting bans, the NFL has somewhat given in to expanded gaming, as legal sports betting has been credited for increased fan engagement, television ratings, and overall interest in the sport.</p>
<p>Stadium Sportsbooks</p>
<p>The NFL most recently lifted its provision that banned sports betting from occurring on the grounds of its stadiums. The league’s owners earlier this year approved of in-stadium sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The Washington Commanders are the only team with an in-stadium sportsbook accessible within the ticketed area. The Arizona Cardinals, along with the New York Giants and Jets, have operational retail sportsbooks on their stadium grounds outside of the gates.</p>
<p>Plainridge Park Casino, a slots and sports wagering facility that doesn’t offer live dealer table games, is located in Plainville, less than five miles south of Gillette Stadium where the Patriots play their home games. Plainridge is home to a Barstool Sportsbook.</p>
