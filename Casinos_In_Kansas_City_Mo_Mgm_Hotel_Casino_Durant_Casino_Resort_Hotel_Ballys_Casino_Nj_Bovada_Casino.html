    <h1>Casinos In Kansas City Mo Mgm Hotel Casino Durant Casino Resort Hotel Ballys Casino Nj Bovada Casino</h1>

<p>Leading online casino operator Casumo announced a new partnership with the award-winning business-to-business (B2B) supplier of mobile and front-end technology for iGaming, casino and sports betting operators, mkodo limited. Under the terms of the freshly minted agreement, mkodo agreed to supply the iGaming operator with GeoLocs, its geolocation verification solution. Per the terms of the new collaboration, Casumo will benefit from the innovative solution, powering its operations in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, Casumo will be able to operate within the regulated gambling sector in Ontario, while complying with the specific geolocation requirements of the region. With GeoLocs, the operator’s players will benefit from a smooth experience for location verification. Online customers can easily and quickly verify their location via Casumo’s application or website, reducing what could be a lengthy process.</p>
<p>Operating for more than a decade, mkodo’s geolocation verification solution is renowned for its effectiveness and scalability. GeoLocs offers dedicated location verification services for the online gambling sector, and it is already used by major operators in the industry.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the solution addresses emerging challenges related to geolocation within the online gambling sector across North America. At the same time, GeoLocs stands out with its seamless integration option that doesn’t require additional downloads or companion apps. Moreover, the solution enables operators to “allow” or “disallow” regions, ensuring compliance with geolocation regulations in different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Recently, Casumo announced a deal with MGA Games. Details regarding the content agreement emerged earlier this month and saw the online gambling operator bolster its Spanish-facing business with the addition of engaging titles from MGA Games.</p>
<p>The New Partnership Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Mark Busuttil, Casumo’s chief product officer, acknowledged the importance of the online gambling sector in Ontario. He confirmed that the company wanted to enter the jurisdiction ever since it opened its online gambling market. “By choosing GeoLocs as our geolocation provider, we are confident that we can offer our players a seamless and user-friendly experience that meets the compliance and regulatory demands of the territory,” added Busuttil. Finally, he spoke about the innovative technology GeoLocs brings and predicted that the solution will help propel Casumo’s growth in the region.</p>
<p>“The technology, knowledge, and expertise behind GeoLocs has been key in supporting us to license and operate in Ontario, during what is a highly anticipated and exciting milestone for Casumo and our players.“ Mark Busuttil, chief product officer at Casumo</p>
<p>Stuart Godfree, mkodo’s managing director, shared the excitement of Busuttil. He explained that the company is proud to join forces and power the expansion of Casumo in Ontario. Godfree predicted that the collaboration will reaffirm GeoLocs’ presence in the region. Finally, he said mkodo is thrilled to deliver its innovative solution and enable Casumo’s clients in Ontario to benefit from seamless geolocation verification.</p>
