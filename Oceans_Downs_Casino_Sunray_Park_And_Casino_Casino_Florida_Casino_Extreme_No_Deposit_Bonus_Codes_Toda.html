    <h1>Oceans Downs Casino Sunray Park And Casino Casino Florida Casino Extreme No Deposit Bonus Codes Toda</h1>

<p>Dear nonyabizzo1,</p>
<p>We would like to clarify the situation regarding your withdrawal attempts. Our support team has sent you 8 emails detailing the reasons for each rejection of your withdrawal requests. Here is a summary of the issues mentioned in the emails:</p>
<p>December 22, 2023: Your withdrawal request was declined due to incorrectly filled in data. The beneficiary name should match your name as it appears in your identity document, without "Mr.", "Miss." and any abbreviations.</p>
<p>December 29, 2023, and January 5, 2024: We informed you that the transaction was successful on the payment provider's side and asked you to contact your bank for confirmation.</p>
<p>January 13 and 14, 2024: We notified you that the funds were returned to your casino account again due to incorrect withdrawal information. We requested you to enter the correct details.</p>
<p>Despite our numerous attempts to reach you via email and forum discussions, you did not respond to any of our communications, but continued to communicate on the forum.</p>
<p>Recent withdrawal requests:</p>
<p>• January 14, 2024: Your request to withdraw funds to a bank account was rejected due to incorrect details. We immediately sent you an email asking you to check and correctly enter the withdrawal information.</p>
<p>• January 15, 2024: You attempted to withdraw funds to cryptocurrency. However, as the deposit was not made in cryptocurrency and your cryptocurrency account was not verified, the request was canceled. We sent you an email asking you to request a withdrawal via bank transfer and double-check the bank details. This requirement is due to our Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policy, which mandates that we process withdrawals using the same method as the deposit.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 880 AUD in your casino account, and you have not made any new withdrawal requests.</p>
<p>We kindly ask you to check carefully your details when requesting a withdrawal, because you keep ordering it to the account that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Please do not use previously saved data that you entered when ordering previous payments. Enter all data manually again, as you may have made a mistake in your saved data and are repeating it.</p>
<p>We remain committed to helping you resolve this issue and urge you to contact us via online chat or respond to one of the emails we sent you. This will allow you to directly communicate with our support team and possibly process a withdrawal request with the correct details immediately.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Playfina Casino</p>
