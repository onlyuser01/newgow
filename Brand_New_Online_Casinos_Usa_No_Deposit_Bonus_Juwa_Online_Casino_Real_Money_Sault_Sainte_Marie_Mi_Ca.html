<p>The judges with extensive experience within the gambling vertical confirmed they will participate in the Judging Panel for the upcoming awards</p>
<p>Macau-based gaming news platform, Inside Asian Gaming (IAG), announced today that more than 60 judges with experience within the gambling vertical are going to participate in the upcoming 2023 IAG Academy IR Awards. So far, a total of 67 judges, that will deliver their expertise for the Awards’ Judging Panel, confirmed they will participate. The long list of judges that confirmed their participation includes representatives of globally-recognized gambling operators and suppliers. Additionally, judges with experience in media, consultancy and law, among other strategic areas related to the gaming vertical will participate as a part of the Judging Panel for the upcoming awards.</p>
<p>Andrew W Scott, IAG’s vice chairman and CEO will be the chairman of the Judging Panel. He will be joined by big names in the gaming sector, including Thomas Borman, Galaxy Macau’s SVP of electronic games, Michael Cheers, IGT’s sales director – Asia and Ashley Fong, Aristocrat’s product planning and strategy manager, among others.</p>
<p>The Much-Anticipated Event Is Scheduled for This September</p>
<p>The upcoming 2023 IAG Academy IR Awards are scheduled to take place on Wednesday, September 13, 2023, at The Ballroom at Hilton Manila, Newport World Resorts. The prestigious event will include awards in 20 different categories, as well as a special ceremony within the IAG Academy Hall of Honor. That ceremony will deliver Rising Stars, Industry Icons, as well as a special Outstanding CEO Award.</p>
<p>IAG confirmed that judges will be recused from specific categories in which their employer may be nominated or may cause a conflict of interest. They will be able to vote on categories they are not recused from and where they have the necessary qualification. If some of the judges consider they are not qualified to pass judgment for a specific category, they may not vote on it.</p>
<p>Voting will be conducted electronically between August 31, 2023, and September 9, 2023. Upon reviewing the categories and nominees, the judges will be presented with a video of up to two minutes, as well as PDF materials of up to five pages. Before casting their votes, they can familiarize themselves with this data and also use personal knowledge regarding the nominees.</p>
<p>According to IAG, more judges can still join the Judging Panel for the upcoming 2023 IAG Academy IR Awards. To participate, applicants need to have a minimum of 10 years within the integrated resorts (IR) sector and a minimum of five years of that experience needs to be within the Asia-Pacific region, among other requirements.</p>
