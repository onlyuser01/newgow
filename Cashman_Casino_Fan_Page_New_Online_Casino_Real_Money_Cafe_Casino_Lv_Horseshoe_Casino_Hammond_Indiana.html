    <h1>Cashman Casino Fan Page New Online Casino Real Money Cafe Casino Lv Horseshoe Casino Hammond Indiana</h1>

<p>I have tried receiving my issue with multiple chat sessions and several emails. I had two slots malfunction three times and every time they glitched during my free spins. Your accumulated winnings do not get automatically credited as your spinning, only after the free spins are complete does the amount get added to your funds. Seeing how when I refreshed the slot to resolve the issue, which every casino I have played up until this one picked up where it left off before the glitch, and the slot acted like I wasn't in the middle of a bonus of any kind. Obviously losing all money that was accumulated and the bonus spins that were yet to be played. They said in both a chat session and several emails that they had credited me 3 separate times amounts of $47 ,$7.90, $10 and $14.95 which would of been close to my accumulated winnings but all that shows on my transactions is one casino credit of $10 which I can verify actually was put in my casino account. They went as far as to say they had to send to the gaming creators to verify this issue. I wasn't thinking the first time a slot glitched on me and lost about $37 with no proof. The other times I took screenshots as it was glitching. If they would just credit what they say they credited minus the ten dollars I would be satisfied and move on. So I have most chats and all emails between various entities. A along with screenshots.</p>
