    <h1>Missouri Casinos Casino Topeka Ks Casino Stocks Casino On Line Free Limitless Casino 200 Free Chip N</h1>

<p>On Saturday, September 08, I played a bonus that they sent me in this casino, I make my complaint after 5 days since they notified me that they would not pay me and they kept all my winnings. As I always read the terms of agreement of the bonuses, this casino unfortunately has a scam type system for its bonuses which does not adjust the maximum bet since it tries to make the user make a mistake so that it exceeds the limit that they estimate, for which I had I had to play very carefully without going over this limit to win and I did, I managed to win the maximum jackpot in the Dork Units game, as attached in the photo 10,000,000 CLP, that is, 10,000 times my bet of 1,000, the maximum bet that I can do according to the bonus is 5,000. After this I continued playing in the casino never passing the 5,000 bet to avoid problems and completed the bonus wager which was 3,000, so I decided to withdraw money 3,000,000 clp which was what I was allowed.</p>
<p>After several days, as shown in the image, they inform me that the money will be returned to my account (which is false) everything disappeared from my account, they left me 300,000 clp, I don't know why, 9,200,000 of what I had.</p>
<p>I need help with that, I've been playing in this company's casinos for months, always investing in their bonuses, getting paid occasionally and the first time I win something and they scam me?</p>
<p>What can I do? Where can I sue them apart from this place?</p>
<p>In the support chat they tell me that 759 which is completely false, in fact I always play spins of 50 spins if I had exceeded the limit I would have noticed.</p>
<p>please help me get my legally earned money.</p>
