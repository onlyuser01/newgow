    <h1>Jamul Casino Buffet Casino Oklahoma City Bigfish Casino Oxford Maine Casino Free Casino Slot Machine</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am Webmaster of www.evolution.casino</p>
<p>I would like to inform all affiliates that Evolution Gaming started case by Wipo to claim this domain of my website from me.</p>
<p>They use excuse that I used their Logo inside of my Website. ( I use their logo in homepage where is infos about Evolution Gaming.) Because of this reason, they wants to have this domain, which I have for 5 years.</p>
<p>I was very positive with them, I respected them, I removed their logo. I asked if I can change anything else for them. But what they want only to have my domain.</p>
<p>They blame me that I use their name for affiliation. and use their logo. This was very weird. Because in my website, I wrote positive contents about Evolution Gaming and I make nice reviews for their games. and I make affiliate for online casinos which has Evolution Gaming Live Casino Games.</p>
<p>So I understood real reason after.</p>
<p>After I make a bit reseach, I got it. 1 day before they send me email: they bought other domains like evolutiongaming.casino</p>
<p>It means: Evolution Gaming LTD eigher start their own online casino or they will make affiliate like Netent.</p>
<p>It is really funny, that Evolution Gaming try to earn money with affiliation. If they are so greedy for money, how can we trust this game provider ?</p>
<p>I hope to win by Wipo. and I won't sale my domain.</p>
<p>As Affiliate we promoted Online Casinos. Online Casinos and Game Providers earned a lot of money. Now Game providers wants to be affiliate. As affiliate my dream is to have own game provider brand. Netent and Evolution Gaming's dreams are to be affiliate. They are funny...</p>
