<p>Consumers will now have their peace of mind with EGBA introducing a new Code of Conduct that fully complies with GDPR. As a result, players will have better control over how their personal data is used and only grant it with their free and unambiguous consent.</p>
<p>New Code of Conduct Defines How Operators Process Data</p>
<p>The European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA) has published a new code of conduct for processing data that will comply with EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR).</p>
<p>EGBA has been able to contribute the first sector-specific guidance that will help the industry achieve full GDPR compliance and establish clear-cut standards for such. GDPR has already turned two years, disrupting some form of communication, but also ensuring that companies and websites carry much more responsibility for consumers’ personal data.</p>
<p>Maarten Haijer, EGBA secretary general, commented on the move, arguing that the organization was pleased to introduce a new code that demonstrated the online gambling sector’s commitment to personal data protection.</p>
<p>Haijer also revealed the number of people actively participating in online gambling in Europe, citing the number as 16.5 million customers. As per the new code, all operators must set up practices showing full compliance with GDPR.</p>
<p>Haijer urged operators to be even more transparent by stating clearly where personal information is stored and for what purposes it is used for, although this already must be covered by any legitimate operator’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>A Little More Legwork for Operators</p>
<p>With the code of conduct now a reality, operators will need to carry out an internal review and ascertain whether they have been complying with the code, and plan possible changes to how they run operations.</p>
<p>All operators must keep proper documentation that proves that they are GDPR-compliant. Operators will further need to conduct a continuous review of their operations lest they miss something out, EGBA cautioned.</p>
<p>Evidence of any compliance audits must be stored for up to three years. Players must give their consent before any personal information can be collected and used. Requesting a consent must be carried out unambiguously and freely.</p>
<p>To be fully compliant with the code of conduct, players will also have to be offered an opportunity to withdraw their consent and data easily, and be aware that such opportunity exists.</p>
<p>The code also specifies that unused data should be destroyed and once a player and a gambling operator conclude business together and have no further ties, the data should once again be deleted from the operator’s servers.</p>
<p>“Data, and how it is used, is playing an increasingly important role in how citizens and businesses interact online – and the online gambling sector is no different,” Haijer cautioned. He is correct, data has been crucial in setting marketing trends but also vulnerable gamers and using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze aberrant gaming behavior indicative of addiction.</p>
