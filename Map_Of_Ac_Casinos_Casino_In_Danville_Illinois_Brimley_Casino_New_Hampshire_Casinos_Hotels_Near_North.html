<p>Azure Gaming Australia Pty Ltd, a supplier of gaming machines and products, has named Mitsuhiro Miyazaki as its new SVP of product management for the Asia Pacific. As part of his duties, Miyazaki will now be in charge of the company’s development and operations in New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>Miyazaki’s Expertise Is Welcome in Azure Gaming</p>
<p>Miyazaki will leverage his industry expertise to better understand and interpret local needs, predict demand and chart the production roadmap for the region. He will be tasked with coming up with insightful strategies as part of the R&amp;D team and ensuring that compliance and sales targets are met.</p>
<p>As part of his duties, Miyazaki will also have to work on boosting sales in a sustained and exponential matter, analyzing consumer and client demand and stepping in preemptively. Miyazaki is a trusted professional and as such, he will also be a director for Azure Gaming Australia, once the official licensing process is complete.</p>
<p>He will work on this venture along with Cameron Louis and Robert Ziems, two other Azure Gaming executives. Azure Gaming remains confident about Miyazaki’s extensive background knowledge. The company cited both his experience with products and R&amp;D as a significant asset that will only help the company’s offer grow.</p>
<p>Azure Global CTO and chairman Masumi Fujisawa welcomed the addition of the new executive and expressed his confidence that he will make a strong addition to an already well-performing team:</p>
<p>We believe the wealth of experience that Mr Miyazaki brings with him will help strengthen Aruze’s product research, planning, and roadmaps throughout the Asia Pacific region. Azure Global CTO and chairman Masumi Fujisawa</p>
<p>Miyazaki’s expertise has been actively honed and shaped as part of other big conglomerates, including Konami Australia.</p>
<p>An Experienced and Well-Seasoned Industry Veteran</p>
<p>He has held various roles within the company, including a managing director for the Australian branch but also other leadership positions as part of the international sales operations of the globally acclaimed company, including as part of Konami’s United States operations.</p>
<p>His technological and business backgrounds are particularly valuable to Azure Gaming today. Miyazaki worked with Hitachi Ltd and Renesas Technology Corporation, and his industry nous and knowledge will now hopefully allow him to settle quickly on the job and help steer Azure Gaming’s expansion in the Asia Pacific.</p>
