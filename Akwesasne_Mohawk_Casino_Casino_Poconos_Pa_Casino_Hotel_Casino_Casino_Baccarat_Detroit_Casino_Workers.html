<p>The cryptocurrency gambling operator Stake.com has expanded its LATAM deal with the Ultimate Fighting Championship martial arts series.</p>
<p>Stake.com and the UFC Extend Commitment</p>
<p>The operator began its relationship with the UFC in March 2021. According to the pre-existing agreement, Stake.com served as the championships official betting partner for Asia and Latin America, excluding Brazil. As per the deal, Stake.com will also become UFC’s official betting partner in Brazil.</p>
<p>The agreement will see Stake.com’s brand propagated throughout UFC’s key assets in Brazil and the rest of Latin America. The championship will include Stake’s logo across its marketing and will feature it inside The Octagon during certain events. Stake.com will also be UFC’s presenting sponsor during the Pay-Per-View event in Brazil.</p>
<p>The two parties will team up promotional activations, providing fans with premium MMA-related content. Fans will be able to watch it on all of UFC’s social media channels. The partnership will also see Stake and the UFC provide fans with tons of promotions and premium experiences.</p>
<p>Lastly, the deal will include an annual brand ambassador fund that will provide exclusive opportunities to UFC fighters.</p>
<p>The Parties Are Happy to Offer More VIP Content to Fans</p>
<p>Mladen Vuckovic, the chief executive of Stake.com, spoke on the importance of the UFC deal to his company. He shared that this relationship will only grow stronger and that the operator can’t wait to welcome UFC’s global fanbase to its innovative platform.</p>
<p>“Our current player base relished the partnership, making the most of VIP experiences and exclusive content to bring them an experience with one of the biggest sporting organizations in the world. This is something they cannot find anywhere else.” Stake.com chief executive Mladen Vuckovic</p>
<p>Nick Smith, the vice president of global partnerships for the UFC, said that the partnership with Stake.com is going really well and he’s excited to continue it in 2022. He is glad to add Brazil to the partnership as he recognizes the importance of the region and the rising demand for sports betting in the country.</p>
<p>Smith said that he looks forward to teaming up with Stake.com once again and offering fans a unique way to experience the MMA action through sports betting. Smith added that the deal with the operator has been welcomed by most fans:</p>
