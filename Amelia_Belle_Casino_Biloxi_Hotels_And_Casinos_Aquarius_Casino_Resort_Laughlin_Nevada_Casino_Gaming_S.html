<p>Dear lpacherresll,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem, but the casino is not in the wrong here. This is stated in the General T&amp;C:</p>
<p>"b) You must enter all the requested mandatory information into your registration form, including your name, place of residence, date of birth, e-mail address and relevant payment information, all of which must be true, complete and current. The name on your registration form must match the name on your debit/credit card, if using. You may only register your own details. You may only register your own details. You participate in the games strictly in your personal non-professional capacity for recreational and entertainment reasons only. You participate in the games on your own behalf and not on behalf of any other person. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that the information you provide is true, complete and current and you must update your account immediately in the event of any changes in the accuracy of the information provided."</p>
<p>This is one of the most basic rules of online gambling and we cannot penalize the casino for this situation. I can only recommend that you always create an account in your own name and deposit and withdraw with a payment method that has been issued in your name.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if there is anything else I could help you with, otherwise, I will be forced to reject this complaint.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
