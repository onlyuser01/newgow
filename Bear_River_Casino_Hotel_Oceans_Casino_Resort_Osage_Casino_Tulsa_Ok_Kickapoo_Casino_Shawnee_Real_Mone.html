<p>Folsom Prison review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Folsom Prison is themed around the iconic American penitentiary made famous by Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>Players will march up to an ominous penitentiary and find a grid of barred cells. Inside the cells are glum prisoners and emblems, and with a little luck, players might just make it out alive.</p>
<p>This slot is a good fit for fans of Johnny Cash, and those in the mood for a sombre atmosphere.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The rhythmic, gloomy soundtrack references the music of Johnny Cash, especially "Folsom Prison Blues", a single he recorded live at Folsom Prison in the 1960s. The reels land with a metallic clang that brings to mind a prison door slamming.</p>
<p>On either side of the reels, watchtowers stand made of brick. The air has a sickly yellow tint that adds to the hopeless feel of the prison world. The reels themselves are packed with prison cells, and many are locked with bars.</p>
<p>The characters of the game look simultaneously world-weary and tough as nails. The oldest prisoner sports a tattoo on his forehead reading "Cash" in elaborate script, giving a clever nod to players’ goal and the theme’s inspiration.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics and soundtrack combine to create a grim world of hard time and blues music.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Folsom Prison has a 4-6-6-6-4 reel structure after expansions, but starts with a 2-2-2-2-0 structure.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>Players have the option to opt into the Toast Bet feature which increases their bet by 20% and provides a guaranteed Scatter on the second reel.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol symbol comes in two forms and substitutes for all paying symbols.</p>
<p>Players can open the locked positions on the reels by landing special symbols. Whenever a Wild, Scatter, xSplit, or xWays symbol lands on an open position, the closest locked positions above and below are opened.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol appears only on the middle two reels during the base game and only on the fifth reel during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>If players land 3 Scatters during the base game, the Walk the Line free spins feature is triggered, starting with 8 free spins. Players are awarded +2 free spins if they land a Scatter during the feature, but +1 spin if the Scatter is affected by xSplits.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.07%, just about our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
