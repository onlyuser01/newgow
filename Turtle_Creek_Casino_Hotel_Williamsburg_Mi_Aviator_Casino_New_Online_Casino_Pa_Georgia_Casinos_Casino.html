<p>Caesars Entertainment has revealed new details about its forthcoming Caesars Sportsbook and World Series of Poker Room based in Harrah’s New Orleans. The company expects everything to proceed according to plan and the two new additions to be launched in the fall of this year.</p>
<p>Both the sportsbook and brick-and-mortar card room are part of a grander renovation plan that saw the hospitality and entertainment company invest $325m to overhaul the property. Caesars is banking on the additions of a new sportsbook and card room to elicit a strong response from local gamblers in Louisiana, but also turn an important hub for gaming enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Caesars is deploying the 5,700 sq ft sports betting space which will feature four dedicated betting windows along with 12 self-service kiosks to ensure that sports fans never miss anything from the betting game. The video walls and constant odd feeds will ensure that sports fans are always in the loop and TVs will cover and broadcast events.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the World Series of Poker card room will come along with 20 poker tables and drinks. Players and visitors can expect the new property to take the Caesars brand and elevate it to new heights, which will then serve for future renovation plans.</p>
<p>Caesars has already confirmed similar plans for its other Louisiana property, the Lake Charles Casino Resort, and will then proceed with another renovation project in Atlantic City, where the company owns several casinos. Commenting on the present and upcoming renovation, though, Caesars Entertainment Regional President Dan Real:</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook at Harrah’s New Orleans will be the foremost sports betting and viewing destination in the southern United States.</p>
<p>Real is confident that the new sportsbook and the 147-foot video screen will be the beating heart of the property. There will be 140 dedicated seating spots for customers to enjoy as they can also book private viewing areas if they want to have a bit of privacy and share the game in the company of close friends.</p>
<p>The "Fan Cave" experience will be capable of hosting up to 10 people. As to the World Series of Poker and its new dedicated card room, Harrah’s New Orleans General Manager Samir Mowad was upbeat about what it meant for the property and the poker community in Louisiana.</p>
<p>He assured us that the property will deliver the best possible experience for poker players who are looking to compete or play recreationally with local events hosted around the clock.</p>
