<p>Pariplay Ltd. and Valiant Entertainment agreed on the extension of their partnership for three more years.</p>
<p>A Strengthened Real Money Games Partnership</p>
<p>On Wednesday, leading content aggregator and iGaming titles developer Pariplay Ltd announced it had reinforced its alliance with New York-based comic books publishing company Valiant Entertainment.</p>
<p>The partnership was initially signed in 2014 and allows Pariplay to release Valiant-branded games. A new series of entertaining, character-based games will join Pariplay’s existing portfolio.</p>
<p>Both companies are delighted to add three more years to their mutually-beneficial partnership. President of Consumer Products, Promotions, and Media Sales at Valiant Entertainment Russell Brown shared the company’s excitement and said that “Pariplay’s far-reaching global presence provides an excellent platform to introduce all new branded games.”</p>
<p>Richard Mintz, Marketing Director at Pariplay, declared the company was very satisfied with the results of the deal and that Valiant-inspired games are very popular among players.</p>
<p>“With their library of over 2,000 characters, the possibilities with them really do seem endless,” he said.</p>
<p>Adding a brand new set of Valiant-branded casino games will contribute to Pariplay’s international expansion campaign and will offer players a nice gaming experience loaded with exciting stories and fun comic characters.</p>
<p>A Wide Range of Games Available</p>
<p>As a result of this successful collaboration, Pariplay has already developed a range of games featuring Valiant’s characters, including the hit titles Bloodshot, Bloodshot Rising Spirit, and X-O Manowar. Besides, as a leading aggregator and content provider, Pariplay, has just launched another action-packed signature game named Faith, featuring another popular of Valiant character, the famous Harbinger Renegade.</p>
<p>Founded in 1990, Valiant Entertainment was acquired by DMG Entertainment in 2018. Under the direction of the Los Angeles-based global entertainment leader, Valiant’s iconic characters came to life and became global franchises, most notably Bloodshot, which had its own action movie released earlier this year and starring Vin Diesel.</p>
<p>Thanks to this renewed partnership, Valiant’s characters have a new home to enjoy for the next three years, thanks to Pariplay’s unique iGaming offering. The company is committed to responsible and fair gaming. It currently holds a gaming license from the Gibraltar Gaming Commission and another from the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>Pariplay has also entered into a content partnership with award-winning Digitain recently, with Pariplay seeing its unique content, Ignite Studio solution and Fusion aggregation platform hitting the shelves at Digitain’s B2B partners.</p>
<p>Additionally, the firm has entered the Spanish iGaming market last month via 888casino’s Spain-facing MGA Games brand, seizing an opportunity to reach new consumers, after having entered the Portuguese and Swiss markets earlier this year.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s most recent tie-up with Valiant allows the company to pivot towards a global market full of opportunities and not least, a chance to deliver a unique iGaming experience other developers would be keen to match up.</p>
