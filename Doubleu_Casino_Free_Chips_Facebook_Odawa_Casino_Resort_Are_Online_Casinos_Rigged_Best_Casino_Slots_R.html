    <h1>Doubleu Casino Free Chips Facebook Odawa Casino Resort Are Online Casinos Rigged Best Casino Slots R</h1>

<p>It's not the payout amounts that are a problem for me, it's the truly ridiculous time it takes for them to actually pay you. I deal with 4 online gambling companies and Xpokies is, hands down, the worst for payment delays.</p>
<p>Understandably it takes a little time for the first payout with every company...but once they have all your documents and everything has been verified things really speed up: usually 24 to 48 hours, max, from the time of requesting payout to the funds arriving in your bank account. It's fantastic. But not Xpokies.</p>
<p>Regardless of your account having previously been 100% fully verified they insist you download, print out and verify each and every deposit manually, with a signature. Then you have to scan the completed manual verification form and send it back to them. Its should be relatively quick and easy...but nope. It can, and has, taken them the better part of a week just to email me the verification form. And regardless of how promptly I have filled it in and returned it (I normally take less than an hour to return the completed form by email) it still takes them literally weeks to send the payout. Average wait time is 3 weeks, but if the payout is $400 or more it takes even longer. And that's for payouts which have never been questioned, or inspired scrutiny of any kind, no problems, investigations or controversy...no issues of any kind! I have had 4 withdrawals so far, the largest of which was $1100, well within their weekly payout limit. But despite Xpokies having confirmed their receipt and verification of all the forms and documents required (remember this was now my fourth withdrawal, not the first) the requested payout amount remained in my gaming account, just sitting, doing nothing, without any further updates on when, or if, it was going to be approved (let alone processed) for another 6 full days! After finally receiving notification of approval and the funds were withdrawn from the gaming account, it took an additional 10 days for it to appear in my bank account. And one last insult, although their website proudly and boldly states that no fees of any kind are incurred for credit card payouts and deposits (which is the only method Ive ever used on their site), a $60 fee was taken from the amount they finally paid me.</p>
<p>I have serious concerns about their solvencyâ€¦otherwise they have the absolute worst, most inefficient staff ever hired! Players should be made aware that this is their standard business practice and not an uncommon event. Their claim of "lightening fast withdrawals" is anything but!</p>
