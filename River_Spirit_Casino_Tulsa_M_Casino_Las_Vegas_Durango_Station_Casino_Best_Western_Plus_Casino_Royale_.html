<p>What to Expect from Cutelaba vs Clark</p>
<p>Many people will be interested in the upcoming fight between Cutelaba and Clark. Cutelaba has long been touted as a fan-favorite athlete who has won the hearts of many. Known for his quick first-round finishers and powerful KO/TKOs, Cutelaba is bringing a lot of punching power.</p>
<p>He is coming into the fight on a bad beat, though, after achieving a draw versus Dustin Jacoby and losing against Magomed Ankalaev back-to-back. Yet, he is still tipped to win at (-145).</p>
<p>Most of his wins so far have been clocked against little-known fighters but fans still enjoy watching Cutelaba whose presence in the ring is noticeable and resonates with the crowds. He has been dubbed “THE HULK” by fans.</p>
<p>If Cutelaba manages to find his way to the top, he is bound to become an even bigger sensation as his one-punch/game-over style is truly entertaining unless you are on the receiving end of this punch.</p>
<p>To do that, he will have to overcome Devin Clark who is evenly matched. Clark has also been struggling to establish a clear record. He most recently lost to the event’s main card fighter, Anthony Smith in a 2:34-minute bout. He won his fights against Dequan Towsend and Alonzo Menifield in five minutes each.</p>
<p>Both fighters were fairly good and experienced, giving Clark a solid foothold. Clark will be facing two problems in the upcoming bout. On the one hand, he has to stay clear of Cutelaba’s one-shot punch. On the other, he has to outlast and outfight him. With an aggressive fighter such as Cutelaba, this is likely to be a difficult task, but if Cutelaba goes in too aggressively, he might end up tired early in the fight.</p>
