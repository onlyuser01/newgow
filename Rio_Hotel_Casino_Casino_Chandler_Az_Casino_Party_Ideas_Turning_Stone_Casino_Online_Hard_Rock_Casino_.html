    <h1>Rio Hotel Casino Casino Chandler Az Casino Party Ideas Turning Stone Casino Online Hard Rock Casino</h1>

<p>It has been more than a year since slots studio Wazdan took its products to live in the US, beginning</p>
<p>with the state of New Jersey. Having gotten over 50 games certified in this state alone, the company</p>
<p>has gone on to expand to two other states, Michigan and West Virginia, as well as the Canadian</p>
<p>province of Ontario. With no signs of slowing down, Wazdan will soon be entering Pennsylvania and</p>
<p>Connecticut, as well as releasing new games with innovative, engagement-boosting features.</p>
<p>We caught up with the company’s COO, Michal Imiolek, to discuss its aggressive expansion and its</p>
<p>plans for the future.</p>
<p>How would you describe the company’s first year in the US?</p>
<p>Everybody knew when it first appeared that the US opportunity was a massively appealing one, but</p>
<p>we have been truly taken back by the uptake of our games in the states that they have been rolled</p>
<p>out in.</p>
<p>There is a huge amount of cultural crossover between America and Europe, so we were confident</p>
<p>that our games and mechanics would resonate with US players considering they have been tried and</p>
<p>tested in a more mature market. What will be interesting is seeing US customers’ tastes develop as</p>
<p>they become more discerning.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we’re working to have our portfolio feature a mix of established content from our</p>
<p>existing catalog and innovative new games. As well as that, we’re making significant headway</p>
<p>through our unique games range with pioneering features, innovative reel arrays, attractive</p>
<p>bonuses, and new ways to win.</p>
<p>Of course, this rapid progress doesn’t mean it hasn’t been a challenging year on the other side of the</p>
<p>pond. Introducing an offering that has been successful in a mature market doesn’t necessarily</p>
<p>translate to immediate uptake in a brand-new one – rather the sector will need to constantly</p>
<p>monitor and learn from the situation in order to ensure continued success.</p>
<p>What have been the most important factors in appealing to the US player base?</p>
<p>There is absolutely no doubt that a mobile-first offering is essential to appeal to the US player base.</p>
<p>A recent report indicated that a staggering 95.3 percent of slot players use mobile devices.</p>
<p>Players in every jurisdiction are constantly on the lookout for something new, and the US is certainly</p>
<p>no exception. Nowadays, new features don’t just need to be entertaining but also functional and</p>
<p>easily understood at the same time, so often it is not a case of reinventing the wheel and more a</p>
<p>case of finding a niche in the market.</p>
<p>It’s still early days, but the initial signs are that the US iGaming market is as seismic as anticipated.</p>
<p>There are some wrinkles to be ironed out, and the sector has yet to crack customer needs,</p>
<p>expectations and preferences, but the sheer potential of the landscape will make this effort well</p>
<p>worthwhile.</p>
<p>What do you expect from the US opportunity going forward?</p>
<p>New Jersey is the number-one state in terms of iGaming revenue, with Pennsylvania and Michigan in</p>
<p>second and third place. All three states generated an impressive $1bn in gaming revenue last year; a</p>
<p>record no state had achieved before this, and we expect this momentum to continue.</p>
<p>However, there are significant barriers to entry that don’t exist in Europe. The challenges presented</p>
<p>by the fragmented nature of the developing landscape are well known. Every jurisdiction has its own</p>
<p>distinct licensing requirements, which vary greatly from state to state, representing a high cost in</p>
<p>terms of resources and the amount of time it takes to be granted a license.</p>
<p>The country’s size, scale, and potential are different from any other market, but this is also balanced</p>
<p>out by operators and suppliers having to be regulated in individual states, which means high</p>
<p>regulatory costs and barriers to entry for many of them. This will require a deft hand and careful</p>
<p>attention to how customer preference sways, but the gains justify the input.</p>
<p>What should operators be doing to maximize retention?</p>
<p>While a great deal of operators in the US have made player acquisition their priority, which has</p>
<p>made sense as the market is not new, those looking to succeed in the long term should now turn</p>
<p>their attention to retaining the customers they have already accumulated. This is easier said than</p>
<p>done, of course. There are many factors to consider, including customer service and quick payout,</p>
<p>but the most important element is making sure the customer enjoys the product.</p>
<p>We are glad to say that our products, including Hold the Jackpot titles Power of Gods: Hades, Sun</p>
<p>of Fortune, and Fortune Reels, have seen positive uptake. However, the reality is that this is a new</p>
<p>market, and we are still identifying what will resonate effectively with its audience.</p>
<p>Of course, few tools are more effective in acquisition and retention than innovative jackpots, and it</p>
<p>has become apparent that the US audience is strongly receptive to the dynamic. Given how iconic</p>
<p>jackpots have been in US land-based casinos, this shouldn’t surprise us, but our Hold the Jackpot</p>
<p>bonus series has undoubtedly captured imaginations. US players appreciate a great deal of control</p>
<p>over their gaming experience, with customizable volatility being highly regarded. With that in mind,</p>
<p>we have ensured our proprietary customization tools are available, enabling audiences to set their</p>
<p>games to what suits their style of play best.</p>
