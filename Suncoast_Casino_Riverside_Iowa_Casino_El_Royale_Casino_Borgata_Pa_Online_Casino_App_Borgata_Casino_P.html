<p>Dear Leon,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. Could you please advise if you have requested your limits to be decreased and, subsequently, increased inside your account manually or you have done it through a Customer Service team? Furthermore, please specify which limits you have requested to be changed as there are 4 different kinds.</p>
<p>I have checked responsible gaming section, and this is what I found https://www.megalotto.com/en/?modal=%2Fen%2Fresponsible-gaming:</p>
<p>SET YOUR LIMITS TO REDUCE YOUR RISK</p>
<p>It is advisable to decide on your financial limits before you start to play, as the chances of players experiencing a gambling problem, is greatly reduced with this in mind.</p>
<p>You can control your play with 4 different types of limits:</p>
<p>· Deposit limits enable you to set a limit on the amount of money you deposit into your account for a given period;</p>
<p>· Net loss limits allow you to control the maximum amount of money you can lose over the selected period;</p>
<p>· Wagering limits allow you to limit the amount you can wager for the period selected;</p>
<p>· Session limits will limit the amount of time you can stay logged into your account.</p>
<p>The financial limits can be set on a daily, weekly or monthly basis and you can adjust your limits whenever you choose to. This facility is available online here when logged in or by contacting our Customer Service team.</p>
<p>The financial limits may be reduced immediately at any time. Any request to increase or remove a limit is subject to a 7 days ‘cooling-off’ period. The original limit will remain active until then."</p>
<p>Could you please forward any relevant communication or screenshots of your account settings to petronela.k@casino.guru? I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards, Petronela</p>
