<p>After a glitch caused the partypoker MILLION to be cancelled two weeks ago, the brand held the tournament again with great success.</p>
<p>Partypoker MILLION Awards $152,700 Top Prize</p>
<p>When partypoker decided to relaunch its partypoker MILLION tournament, things didn’t exactly go according to plan. A glitch resulted in a whole flight of players not being carried over to Day 2 but, the online poker brand tried again the following week with much better results.</p>
<p>This time around, Day 1A started on November 3rd with Day 1s running until November 10th. All of the players who survived their Day 1s were moved forward into Day 2, and there were no setbacks keeping any players from competing.</p>
<p>All in all, the partypoker MILLION attracted 4,658 runners for a generous prize pool of $931,600. To make the $1 million guarantee, partypoker put in almost $70,000 – so there was a bit of an overlay which certainly benefitted players.</p>
<p>The winner of the event was Velazquez76, who earned $152,700. Second place went to mickeyMous3, who received $106,650.</p>
<p>It was thought that the glitch which occurred during the first week would have discouraged players from taking part in the next partypoker MILLION, but this wasn’t the case. In fact, there was even less of an overlay this time around. It also helped that partypoker offered buy-ins to all of the players who were affected the previous week.</p>
<p>The partypoker MILLION will now be run every week, so you could have your shot at winning big if you’re an online poker fan. The event has a schedule that is flexible for players, running Day 1s all week. Players can enter as many Day 1s as they want, and only their biggest stack will be carried through to Day 2.</p>
<p>The idea behind this format is to allow for players to take part in a generous tournament but without having to worry about playing for 12 hours or more at a time. In fact, partypoker states that the tournament has been designed so that players have the time to sleep even if the make the money.</p>
<p>The buy-in for the partypoker MILLION is $215, but there are all sorts of satellites running throughout the week for players with all sizes of bankrolls. Buy-ins range from $4 to $33 you can vie for the chance to win a life-changing prize even if you’re a microstakes player on partypoker.</p>
