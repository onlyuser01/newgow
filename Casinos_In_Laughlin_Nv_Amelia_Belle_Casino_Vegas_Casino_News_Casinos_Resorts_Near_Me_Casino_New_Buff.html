    <h1>Casinos In Laughlin Nv Amelia Belle Casino Vegas Casino News Casinos Resorts Near Me Casino New Buff</h1>

<p>Had a tonybet account since 2022. No issue, fully verified, multiple deposits and withdrawals. Stopped gambling months ago due to some issues. Also have left country where they were licensed. Can't gamble where I am now in gibraltar.</p>
<p>Realised I had 260 in the account, which was a 200 deposit and small winnings from a sports bet I think. I requested teh withdrawal and then they said I needed to send in a pdf of my address. I pointed out I was fully verified for two years and no longer lived in the country so needed the money returned and account closed.</p>
<p>They then seemed to revel in the fact they were closing my account and stealing not only my 60 euro winnings but also my 200 euro deposit!!!!</p>
<p>Ive been advised this is against EU consumer law and some people online have sent me evidence of them returning money to players in similair circumentsances, so maybe I got someone on their bad day or its discrimination?</p>
<p>Attached is the email they have sent to me no short of 5 times. WIll be contacting my solicitor monday and their ADR.</p>
<p>Wanted to warn people and see if anyone had this before?</p>
<p>Has affected me emotionally to be honest so will be looking for compensation.</p>
<p>Attached is the term they keep referencing. Not sure how this applies to me? It also does not say they can steal a deposit, I also can't find anything in their Ts and Cs that superseeds EU consumer law or where I agreed to this?</p>
<p>I am also attaching my account being verified and the withdrawals put throgh in 2022.</p>
<p>I am also attaching the last time I deposited (which is the deposit they are trying to steal) last year in April 2023.</p>
