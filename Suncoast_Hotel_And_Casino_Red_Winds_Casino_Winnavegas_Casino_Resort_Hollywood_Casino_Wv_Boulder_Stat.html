<p>Ahead of Round 28 of the Italian Serie A, Napoli and AC Milan are occupying the two top spots in the standings, both with 57 points. Inter is behind with one game in hand, meaning that the title race is going to get even more interesting.</p>
<p>That said, winning as many points as possible is what these teams are all thinking about, which promises a super-interesting battle on Sunday at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.</p>

<p>Napoli Dreaming of the Title</p>
<p>After losing 4-2 at home to Barcelona in the Champions League, it doesn’t seem very likely Napoli can stay in this competition. That said, they might decide to focus entirely on the Italian top-flight. That is where they stand a pretty good chance of winning their first trophy since the Maradona days.</p>
<p>They are 17-6-4 this season, with no defeats in the league since the start of the year. Their most recent Serie A game saw them beat Lazio in Rome. Lorenzo Insigne was superb in that game, scoring once and making one assist (to Fabian Ruiz).</p>
<p>As a result, Insigne is now Napoli’s joint top-scorer with two other players – Dries Mertens and Victor Oshimen. All three have scored seven goals so far. Fabian Ruiz is just behind with six goals, while Piotr Zielinski has five goals to his name.</p>
<p>That said, Napoli has plenty of offensive weapons which is surely giving this team a lot of confidence ahead of the clash with AC Milan. Apart from being great offensively, the Sky Blues from Naples have also been great at the back. In fact, with just 19 goals conceded in 27 games, they have the best defense in Serie A.</p>
<p>AC Milan Doesn’t Know of a Defeat in Seven Games</p>
<p>AC Milan is without a loss since January 17, when they lost to Spezia. This team is undefeated in seven games in all competitions. This may sound impressive, but four of those games were draws. In fact, each of AC Milan’s three previous games finished in a draw. They played 2-2 with Salernitana and 1-1 with Udinese. Their most recent game saw them play 0-0 with Inter in the Italian Cup.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why AC Milan hasn’t been better is that several of its key men are out with injuries. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Milan’s top-scorer is out with a tendon injury, while two defenders – Simon Kjaer and Alessio Romagnoli – are out with a knee and thigh injury respectively.</p>
<p>Without them on the pitch, AC Milan is likely to struggle. In fact, even with those guys playing in their first game with Napoli this season, AC Milan failed to do much. On December 19, they lost 1-0 to Sky Blues at home.</p>
<p>Picks: Napoli to Win; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
