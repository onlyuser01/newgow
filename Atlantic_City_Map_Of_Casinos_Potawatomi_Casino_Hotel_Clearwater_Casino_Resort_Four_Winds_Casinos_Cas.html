<p>Global hosting provider Internet Vikings has minted a new multi-year partnership with PlayStar Casino for the United States and a particular focus on the New Jersey market. The casino is pending launch in the Garden State in the first quarter of 2022 subject to final approvals.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, PlayStar chief business development officer Adam Noble said that the company was thrilled to be teaming with Internet Vikings to carry out PlayStar’s launch in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“Sportsbook and iGaming hosting is a very different landscape in the US compared to Europe that presents a number of challenges. This partnership allows us to get on with our core business, safe in the knowledge our technology stack is in good hands,” Noble explained.</p>
<p>The move marks an important step-up for Internet Vikings, which has been mostly focusing on iGaming businesses in Europe. With the PlayStar tie-up, the company will bring its expertise across the Atlantic once again, and in one of the pivotal gaming markets in the US.</p>
<p>The company already established its footprint in Colorado and West Virginia earlier this year with company CEO Peter Ekmark welcoming the new opportunity in New Jersey and the United States.</p>
<p>“We are extremely proud for two reasons. First of all, entering New Jersey is an achievement on its own. Currently, it’s the most sought after, yet difficult to enter, state in the US,” the chief executive said.</p>
<p>Yet, New Jersey’s importance to the iGaming industry is significant as it handles 21.5% of the total sports betting handle out of all regulated states, at least for the first half of 2021. Online gambling in August increased by 29% year-over-year, clocking in $113.2 million, Internet Vikings explained in a press release.</p>
<p>The company acknowledged the difficulties that are often associated with gaining market entry as the regulators expect a spotless performance by companies willing to set up their operations on the market.</p>
<p>Ekmark thanked PlayStar for putting their trust in Internet Vikings and said: “We are not planning to stop here. We will continue to expand and transform so that we can fulfill the needs of our clients at every step of their growth process.”</p>
