    <h1>Sky City Casino Hotel In Acoma Pueblo New Mexico Reno Nevada Casino Hotels Tulalip Resort And Casino</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>i played 2 deposit bonuses on Rocknrolla without any luck. so i deposit for the 3rd deposit bonus. I have better luck on that bonus and wager the hole bonus. when i had 1 spinn remaning off the wager i had the ammount off 109000uBTC (3990Usd) after that spinn my ammount changed to 54,789.82uBTC (1896 usd) i ask the chatt why? and they told me that they had a maxwin on that bonus for the amount of 50000uBTC. i had read all the terms of the bonus and there is nothing about a maxwin in there rules. i contakt the chat again and ask them where i can find the rules they refer to on there site. the answear i get is followin from the chatt "We are saying here, that this is the current maximum payout. i am not able to clerify any further for you as that is what this bonus is set to"</p>
<p>so they confirm its not in the rules.</p>
<p>i feel that this was wrong but i dont want to be a problem for the casino becouse i had 1896usd in uBTC left on the account. i made a withdraw on that money, after that they asked my to send in pictures for verifacation. i send them all the pictures they asked for. it was passport, adress and a selfie with a paper when i had written the date on. after that i didnt heard anything so i asked the chat why its taking that time and they answear that they working on it. yesterday i recived a mail and i think that i finely should get my withdraw. this is what they write to me.... "</p>
<p>Hi Swara,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our KYC &amp; AML team have informed me that they are not able to verify your account with us and that we must close it down. Per company policy, we will allow you to withdraw your most recent deposit which in this case is 4,988.04 uBTC. We have set your balance to this amount now, please make a new withdrawal request and we will process it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>this is after i send them all the documents they asked for. i have not doing anything wrong and if they told me that they need more pictures to verify my account i should send them more pictures. but they never asked fore that before they took this decision.</p>
<p>So first they took 2000usd then they took 2000usd more for absolutly no reeson. i am totaly sad and have no idea what i should do to get my money back. I hope that you can help me to solve this problem for me.</p>
<p>i have printscreen pictures and emails to confirm this if you need it.</p>
