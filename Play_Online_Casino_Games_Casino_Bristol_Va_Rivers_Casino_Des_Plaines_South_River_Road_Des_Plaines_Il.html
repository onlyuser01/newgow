    <h1>Play Online Casino Games Casino Bristol Va Rivers Casino Des Plaines South River Road Des Plaines Il</h1>

<p>I received an email to play with 50 free spins, I used them, went completely thru all requirements.</p>
<p>Played for hours and made a deposit also after all requirements had long been gone thru. Followed everything exactly as stated.</p>
<p>I also had made a couple deposits to this casino before then.</p>
<p>They denied my payout and completely took my entire balance. I did get 50.07 credited to my account later on.</p>
<p>I then withdrew that and processed a deposit with a bonus, and later another deposit with bonus.</p>
<p>My 3rd deposit and code, I did the exact same thing and copied the bitcoin address to aend the deposit to, and pasted directly into my Coinbase wallet to process the deposit. 5 hours later I still had no balance in my account.</p>
<p>i contacted the casino, went thru 4 different live agents that kept closing my chat on me and/or refusing to answer.</p>
<p>I then contacted via email, in regards to the live agents but my deposit.</p>
<p>I was told my deposit was wrong and they don’t have a deposit showing or reflection of one pending, I had already contacted my wallet provider and it was sent to the correct address, and brango kept telling me it was not, how do you mess up a copy and paste directly over, but the other deposits that were done exactly the same way went thru, but my deposit was lost.</p>
<p>they refused to do anything about it, so I lost my deposit, I was awarded 10 free spins but when I’m sending screenshots and conversations and proof of the transaction and everything, still tell me I didn’t do that and they have no deposit showing. And they have since stopped responding to any attempt to contact them.</p>
<p>i receive coupons in my email, everything is rejected if I try to claim or proceed.</p>
<p>they were so rude and so uncaring.</p>
