<p>Joining the Nevada Gaming Commission, Markantonis brings extensive experience as a gaming executive after being a part of industry-leading companies for decades</p>
<p>George Markantonis, an entertainment and gaming industry veteran with decades of experience, joined Nevada’s state governmental agency tasked with the regulation of casinos, the Nevada Gaming Commission. The gaming executive was appointed to the commission by Gov. Joe Lombardo.</p>
<p>Confirmation about the appointment emerged Thursday. Markantonis’ new role with the Nevada Gaming Commission is effective as of Friday, April 28, 2023, confirms a statement released by Gov. Lombardo. In his new role, he will be replacing Steve Cohen, the outgoing Commissioner.</p>
<p>This appointment doesn’t mark the first time an experienced gaming executive joins the Commission. Back in 2015, Gov. Brian Sandoval appointed the former gaming executive Michonne Ascuaga to the gaming commission.</p>
<p>Now, Markantonis brings extensive experience of more than three decades in the industry to the Nevada Gaming Commission. At the start of his career, he was a part of Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts. During his 17-year tenure with the company, Markantonis held different leadership-level roles with the company for markets such as the United States, Canada, as well as South Africa.</p>
<p>The Seasoned Gaming Executive Brings Extensive Experience</p>
<p>Markantonis’ professional background after Westin Hotel &amp; Resorts includes a senior vice president of hotel operations position with Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. After that, he was also a part of the development of Kerzner International’s Atlantis, The Palm, Dubai, UAE as CEO. Then, Markantonis was appointed to the role of managing director and president of Kerzner International Bahamas Limited and he held that role for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Following his tenure with Kerzner International Bahamas, Las Vegas Sands appointed the gaming executive as president and chief operating officer of The Venetian, The Palazzo Resorts and the Sands Expo Center early in 2015. In 2021 Markantonis transitioned to the role of CEO of the property after it was sold to VICI Properties and Apollo Global Management. He held that role until mid-2022 when he was appointed to a special advisor role.</p>
<p>“I’m honored to serve on the Nevada Gaming Commission, and I’m grateful to Governor Lombardo for entrusting me with this role.“ George Markantonis</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Markantonis thanked Gov. Lombardo for the trust and said that it is thrilling to join the Nevada Gaming Commission. Last but not least, he added: “I look forward to utilizing my industry experiences to serve the commission in its work protecting the integrity of Nevada’s gaming industry and the interests of all the Nevadans who rely on its ongoing success for their livelihoods.”</p>
<p>Gov. Lombardo was similarly excited about the latest appointment. He thanked the outgoing Commissioner for his efforts and welcomed Markantonis to the Commission.</p>
