    <h1>American Indian Casinos California Casino El Camino Photos Casino Slots Resorts Hotel Casino Caesars</h1>

<p>This casino is a complete rip off and uses apparently scripted slots! Since May 08, 2023, I have now turned over several thousand euros. Not once have I made a win to continue playing with. The slots only run permanently with dead spins as soon as you achieve a micro win.</p>
<p>Play and Go slots in particular is worse than Book of Dead at its worst!</p>
<p>Even if you bet 1 euro, you won at most 12 euro in slots like Reactoonz 2 and Gigantoonz, although these are known for being generous!</p>
<p>If I gamble several hundred euros and then only win 12 euros in a feature, then that is very, very noticeable!</p>
<p>For days, despite deposits of 500 and more euros and maximum stakes of 1.00 euros, small profits! No bonus games.</p>
<p>Nothing happens for hours apart from recurring same slot spins.</p>
<p>Striking: No bonus rounds or other feature games. How is it possible that you have no luck at all with such high deposits?</p>
<p>Several hundred to thousands of spins and nothing comes up?</p>
<p>I'm aware that you have to factor in losses, but in this case you have no gains at all. The raputations don't fit at all. And I also like to play the same slots with very low amounts for several hours.</p>
<p>In addition, the support does not answer e-mails! The chat is rarely available and when it is, he always talks himself out of it. There also seems to be only one supporter!</p>
<p>I want a listing that shows how the comparison between wins and losses looks like.</p>
<p>That alone would tell you that this casino is a rip off.</p>
<p>In addition, there are the daily spins that you get in bonus form. You get 3 free spins permanently. Even if you collect these, you only get Deadspins.</p>
<p>Not even in more than 30 days have you had a bonus credit where you could start wagering because you might win 0.16 cents! As soon as you win an amount in this casino, you only get dead spin waves, which you don't know from other casinos, no matter which slot you go into!</p>
<p>The cashback is also very interesting: You gamble away several hundred euros in a week and then get 1.57 euros back. 1-7 percent. This is more than ridiculous rip off these assholes!</p>
<p>The other bonus conditions can also be thrown into the bin. You have to deposit 100 euros at a time to get bonuses. Collectively, these don't count, so you don't get anything for your loyalty either...</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I don't understand why the casino does so well on Casino Guru when there are consistently negative reviews on Trustpilot alone!</p>
<p>Even with the deposit options, there are only negative features! It is stated that you do not have to pay any additional costs for credit card transfers, but then you are charged usury amounts!</p>
<p>The casino is completely dubious!</p>
