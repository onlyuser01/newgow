    <h1>Hotels Near Wheeling Island Casino Arizona Casino Hotels Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort Choctaw Casino</h1>

<p>I won on 1/30 and requested a withdrawal of $305.75 to my BTC wallet. This casino advertised fast payouts but previous withdrawals took days. I can see my withdrawal request just sitting there in queue today 2/3. This being the longest I've waited. I receive the following conflicting answers each time when I contact customer service. See attached and below. My withdrawal hasn't even been approved 5 days later?</p>
<p>On 1/31:</p>
<p>"This is Sarah Addams from Cryptoloko Casino!</p>
<p>The Coindraw withdrawal time frames are based on an algorithm that assesses customer activity. Most payments are done in minutes and/or hours, but we do allow 24-48 business hours to cover any unforeseen issues or delays."</p>
