    <h1>Double Down Free Casino Chips Casino Royal Casino Machine Games Casino Extreme No Deposit Bonus Code</h1>

<p>Hello, I need your help!</p>
<p>About a month ago, I registered on this betting site.</p>
<p>at the time of deposit, as I did not have a prepaid card in my name, I used that of my son.</p>
<p>No problem for the deposit, in fact I was granted.</p>
<p>Therefore I am aware that I have violated the terms and conditions, I would like some clarifications.</p>
<p>I won the net sum of € 900. I sent my identity document and my account was immediately validated.</p>
<p>When withdrawing € 250, I am reminded not to make deposits with cards in the name of third parties, the money deposited is reversed and I am confirmed that my withdrawal was regularly being processed and that it would be processed within 3 days working.</p>
<p>When I withdraw the remaining part, € 650, they ask me for proof of residence. I send a bill, notifying that I had recently changed residence, but that in any case that bill still reflected my old residence. Their procedure, suspend the account, ask me again for the copy of my driving license, I send it and subsequently no longer receiving an answer, now my account is in a blocked state.</p>
<p>For a large casino it was enough to simply regularize my position as it was doing, instead to avoid my withdrawal, they disappeared.</p>
<p>That's a ridiculous figure for taking such a stern attitude towards me. All the more reason, why give the possibility to deposit anyway? Large casinos, when depositing with other cards immediately block your deposit reminding you of these terms and conditions. I would therefore simply like to ask the staff, if there is a possibility to unlock my account, to receive my sum and to continue playing on this site which by the way I was really enjoying it.</p>
