    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tulsa Cancun Casino Resorts St Croix Casino Slot Madness Casino Fantasy S</h1>

<p>Their original email on May 3rd "Your withdrawal request has been canceled. Reason of decline: "Congratulations on winning the deposit bonus! We are also obliged to notify you that the maximum winnings that will be paid out resulting from a cashback bonus, a comp points bonus, a tournament bonus, any deposit bonus, VIP bonus, a weekly bonus, except for welcome bonus will be 10 000 EUR, 10 000 USD, 15 000 AUD due to our Bonus Terms and Conditions - https://hellspin.com/rules/bonuses Therefore, we have made the decision to confiscate the exceeds winnings. You are left with the maximum amount that is allowed to withdraw from the deposit bonus. Please withdraw it before depositing and playing new bets!""</p>
<p>Please note that I have tried to communicate with support , and they have refused to work with me. There final answer over email was " Kindly note that this decision is not a subject for further discussion."</p>
<p>I will address different concerns/different dates in this complaint.</p>
<p>There are two errors that I would like to address regarding the correction of my balance.</p>
<p>Note : When a player claims a bonus at the casino with a deposit, the player is eligible of withdrawing their winnings when they've won with their cash portion, and have the ability to cancel the bonus. Once your cash balance disappears, the players options are to keep playing with their bonus funds and successfully wager bonus or they may cancel it.</p>
<p>On April 19 I made a deposit of 900 and got a bonus of 450, I had winnings of approximately 6580$ with cash balance , out of this only 4000</p>
<p>$ was paid. Balance remaining was 2580 $. (bonus was canceled because my balance was won with cash balance). - screenshot attached.</p>
<p>The week after, On April 26, I made a deposit of 1200 and got a bonus of 600 (while I had a pending withdrawal of 2000 + 580 from the week before) ; I had winnings of approximately 19656$ with my cash balance, out of this nothing was paid to me. (bonus was canceled because my balance was won with cash balance). - screenshot attached.</p>
<p>Therefore their correction on my account by removing 7236.80$ is erroneous,</p>
<p>as it should've have been only 4656.80 $ (7236.80 - 2580)</p>
<p>Finally, they cannot apply the terms and conditions to my winnings on April 26th , as my winnings were derived solely from Cash Balance. You will be able to verify this as my bonus was cancelled. - shown in the screenshot.</p>
<p>I ask the casino to credit back my account 2580 $ which was wrongfully taken because those winnings were from April 19th.</p>
<p>Secondly credit the other 4656.80$ from April 26th as my winnings were won with the cash portion of my deposit.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
