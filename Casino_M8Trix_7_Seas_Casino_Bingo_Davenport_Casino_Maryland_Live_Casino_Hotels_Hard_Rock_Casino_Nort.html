<p>Legendary Battle of the Nian review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Legendary Battle of the Nian is themed around Chinese imagery, as well as the historic Nian Rebellion.</p>
<p>As the sun sets, players will enter a temple where they’ll find bells, gongs, lanterns, and drums. If they get especially lucky, players might even meet a mysterious dragon.</p>
<p>This slot will appeal to those who are curious about East Asian culture and history.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack mixes traditional Chinese music with modern electronic notes. This creates a dramatic effect that draws players into the game world.</p>
<p>The reels are held within the walls of a temple, with fierce stone lions guarding either side. Behind the reels, a city adorned with lanterns and sculptures can be seen.</p>
<p>Among the symbols are various instruments, including a glossy gong, a drum and drumsticks, and swinging bells. Stone letters carved with ornate designs can also be seen on the reels. Each symbol is illustrated in a vivid cartoon style.</p>
<p>Warm hues of red and gold create a warm and welcoming atmosphere for this slot. The reels seem to glow from the ground up, suggesting the heat of a fire.</p>
<p>Together, the soundtrack and animation create an engaging East Asian fantasy.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Legendary Battle of the Nian is a five-reel, three-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels. These wins are calculated from the leftmost reel towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>After winning combinations pay out, the winning symbols vanish, making room for more symbols to fall into their positions from above. This is called a Cascade.</p>
<p>Players can buy direction into the Free Spins feature by selecting the Feature Buy option for 60x their total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Wilds appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and substitute for all symbols excluding Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Scatters, the Free Spins feature begins, starting with 15 free spins. Every position containing a triggering Scatter is given a level 1 upgrade.</p>
<p>For every Cascade that takes place during the Free Spins feature, positions containing Scatters are awarded a level 1 upgrade. If the position already had a level 1 upgrade, it is granted a level 2 upgrade. Finally, if the position already had a level 2 upgrade, it is granted a level 3 upgrade.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Free Spins feature, a prize is awarded corresponding to each upgrade that was achieved.</p>
<p>Level 1 upgrades award 0.5x-1.33x the total bet, level 2 upgrades award 1.67x-5x the total bet, and level 3 upgrades award 6.67x-16.67x the total bet. Level 3 upgrades can also award Minor Prizes of 33.33x the total bet, or Major Prizes of 166.67x the total bet.</p>
<p>A Grand Prize of 5,000x the total bet is awarded if all positions achieve a level 3 upgrade.</p>
<p>If players land 3 or more Scatters during the Free Spins feature, the feature is retriggered with an additional 15 free spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.14%, close to our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.30 up to a maximum of $/£/€210 per spin.</p>
<p>Legendary Battle of the Nian offers medium volatility, making it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility Chinese culture and history-themed slot.</p>
<p>Legendary Battle of the Nian offers a solid RTP, an attractive frontend, and engaging bonus features.</p>
<p>However, mathematically-inclined players may wish to note that this slot’s volatility is more moderate. These players might move on to more volatile slots eventually, but they’ll still enjoy checking out Legendary Battle of the Nian.</p>
