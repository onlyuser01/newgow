<p>In a bid to supply tailor-made content, Microgaming has signed a ground-breaking partnership with up-and-coming South African iGaming developer Aurum Signature Studios this week.</p>
<p>Microgaming Adds Aurum to Bring More Unique Content</p>
<p>Leading iGaming developer Microgaming has grown its portfolio with the addition of Aurum Signature Studios, an up-and-coming developer of games for the online casino sector operating out of South Africa. With this move, Microgaming consolidates what is a growing portfolio of dedicated independent game designers.</p>
<p>The company, Microgaming says, will become the first to provide it with tailored-made slots developed exclusively for its product portfolio. Aurum has already developed a number of promising slot titles under its own brand, including but not limited to The Immortal Captain Rizk!, 20 Year Celebration, Galactic Gold, Treasure Quest, A Tale of Elves, and others.</p>
<p>Imbuing each game with quality graphics and a number of player-favorite features, Aurum already sports an impressive portfolio of over 20 dedicated games deployed across numerous operators worldwide.</p>
<p>Signing up with Microgaming will allow the company to gain sufficient exposure on a global market dominated by a company that leads the way in crafting unique player-focused games.</p>
<p>Aurum already employs a team of talented artists, coders, and game designers who create bespoke gaming products that work well on desktop and mobile and fit in with Microgaming’s own omni-channel strategy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Microgaming is scaling up its portfolio of developers by adding more talented companies and consolidating them under its own brand name. Microgaming’s network has expanded significantly over the years.</p>
<p>The company announced in October that it will be deploying the Megaways feature across a number of its upcoming slots, having signed a partnership with Big Time Gaming, the studio that holds patent rights over the mechanic. In a similar deal in October, Microgaming made a return back to poker, announcing a number of poker games.</p>
<p>Executives Happy to Grow and Expand</p>
<p>Both companies have been pleased with the partnership, with Microgaming CEO John Coleman welcoming the opportunity to strengthen the company’s portfolio and content strategy with a worthwhile new addition,</p>
<p>Coleman said that Microgaming seeks to create “varied and innovative” products and that Aurum would make a strong addition to this end. He cited growing customer demand for unique and personalized gaming content which is precisely what capacity Aurum is being brought in.</p>
<p>Madelein Özok who is Head of Aurum Signature Studios said that the company was thrilled to be teaming up with Microgaming.</p>
<p>The “sheer scale of the company” would allow Aurum to gain the exposure and reach high-tier operators on a global scale, Özok said. “It’s our mission to create exciting, innovative games, and we knew we were on the right track when Microgaming chose to exclusively launch Aurum as its bespoke provider,” the executive concluded.</p>
