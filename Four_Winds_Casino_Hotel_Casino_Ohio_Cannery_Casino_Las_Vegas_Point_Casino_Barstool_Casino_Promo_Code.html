<p>Smoking and consuming beverages on casino floors in Atlantic City will resume this Friday, following an order by state officials.

<p>Indoor Dining Resumes on Friday with Occupancy Limits</p>
<p>In a statement, Governor Murphy said: ‚ÄúGiven the progress we continue to see statewide, and with the proper precautions and limitations in place, I am proud that we can take this step today to allow our restaurants to once again welcome patrons back for indoor dining services.‚Äù He also expressed hope that the resumption will only lead to a future increasing in occupancy limits.</p>
<p>According to data by the Atlantic County Division of Public Health, for the last six days until yesterday, there were no newly reported deaths related to COVID-19. In total, Atlantic County has seen 3,989 positive COVID-19 cases with 245 deceased patients. On the bright side, some 2,697 patients have already recovered.</p>
<p>But here is what Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said in a statement: ‚ÄúSitting at a table inside a favorite restaurant and enjoying a good meal with family and friends has been a shared missed experience for New Jerseyans.‚Äù He added that the introduced measures are aiming at ensuring the health and safety of both visitors and employees.</p>
<p>Smoking-Free Casinos Still a Controversial Topic</p>
<p>Smoking-free casino floors is a controversial topic for a long time. But only recently, we observed some changes which were introduced by casino operators. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the mandatory wearing of masks, many operators chose to ban smoking from the casino floors. This however raised concerns with many operators in terms of how will the smoke ban impact their revenue, given that in the COVID-19 environment many venues operate under reduced capacity.</p>
<p>But looking at data from a poll by Las Vegas Advisor revealed last week, we see that smoke-free casinos are supported by 72% of the interviewed gamblers. According to the paper, 150 casinos that used to allow smoking before the COVID-19 shutdown, have reopened and introduced a ban on smoking. The responders who participated in the poll had to choose from 13 sections which contained statements regarding smoking in casinos. Some 72% out of the 1523 responders supported smoke-free casinos. In contrast, an approximate one-fourth of the total number of people approved smoking in casinos.</p>
