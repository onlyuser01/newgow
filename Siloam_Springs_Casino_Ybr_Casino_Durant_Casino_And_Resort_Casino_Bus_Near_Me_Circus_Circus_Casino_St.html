    <h1>Siloam Springs Casino Ybr Casino Durant Casino And Resort Casino Bus Near Me Circus Circus Casino St</h1>

<p>I signed up to Starda casino with the intention of playing some serious money (£1000+).</p>
<p>I accepted a small no deposit bonus. 50 free spins to test site. Well aware of bonus violations as another casino stole over 600 EURO from me for supposed max bet violations.</p>
<p>I followed ALL rules. My 50 spins made me 8.83 EUR. There was a 45x wager requirement. I completed it with tiny bets of 0.2 and 0.3 eur. The total winning during wagering was over 150 EUR, but the casino capped it at 10x the win (88.3 EUR).</p>
<p>I was really keen on depositing a large amount as I liked the casino a lot (they had Funky Time and a lot of new games). It is then that the problem started.</p>
<p>My withdrawal of 20 EUR was denied. I was referred to bonus terms 10.6. Chat stated: "Management reserves the right to request a deposit of equal amount to what you want to withdraw, and wager that 3x before withdrawal accepted."</p>
<p>Confused, I looked at 10.6. VIOLATIONS?!</p>
<p>"10.6.</p>
<p>Liability for bonus abuse</p>
<p>Before wagering a no deposit bonus, the personal data must be filled out in the profile. If the profile is filled out after receiving a no deposit bonus, the bonus and all related winnings shall be void.If you have an active bonus and obtain free spins and other bonuses in any game, you have to wager them before switching to another game. If you place bonus money bets in any other game when there are unused free spins or other uncompleted bonus games, these actions shall be considered a deliberate violation of the Casino rules. If the Casino identifies such violations, it reserves the right to refuse any payouts and/or confiscate all winnings obtained using the aforementioned strategies.If you create duplicate accounts, intentionally provide false information upon signing up or inaccurate data during account verification, the bonuses you have received and all related winnings shall be void.</p>
<p>If a no deposit cumulative bonus is received but we suspect fraudulent activity, we reserve the right to ask you to make a deposit equal to the wagered bonus funds in your account at the time the withdrawal request is submitted (not less than 10 €, and ask to wager the deposit three times.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change, alter, or amend the bonus terms and conditions at any time. Players should regularly check the Terms and Conditions for any updates."</p>
<p>I asked Chat agent, to clarify if any violations had been made. Chat refused to explain. They said management had decided that for any withdrawal I make, I need to first deposit the equal amount and wager 3x.</p>
<p>Even more confused, I asked to have this put in writing as that was not part of bonus terms.</p>
<p>Chat agent said not to ask more questions, that this was management's decision.</p>
<p>I then asked them, is that rule applying for ALL WITHDRAWALS? Chat agent ended chat saying: "This is standard Curacao license.... In order to withdraw funds, you need to win back your deposit".</p>
<p>WHAT?? I have never heard of such a rule.</p>
<p>I feel cheated here for such a small amount. I told them it was sad to see such fraud in open daylight as I was going to wager £1000 here tomorrow, but after this bullshit I am staying far away from Starda.</p>
<p>STAY AWAY.</p>
