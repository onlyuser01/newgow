<p>Phased reopening for Seneca Nation’s venues have been planned to start in June. The Nation’s president comments on the enhanced safety protocols applicable for all venues.</p>
<p>Seneca Nation Plans Restart of Operations</p>
<p>The announcement was released last week, on Friday, when the Seneca Nation noted that a reopening plan for its properties will start early in June. No specific dates or venue names were specified, but the Nation is yet to discuss the phased plan upon releasing a final statement with further details in the next few days.</p>
<p>The gaming operations of all of the Nation’s venues were ordered to temporary shutdown on March 16. This was forced by the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in New York State, and the main goal was to reduce the outbreak. Now, nearly 3 months since the shutdown of operations, some 4,000 employees have already been affected but the temporary closure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the restart of the Nation’s casinos will also help with the recovery of New York’s economy. Although there is a high chance that the Nation’s properties will reopen at reduced capacity at first, the restart of operations will be beneficial for the entire Western New York region which usually generates millions of monthly revenue.</p>
<p>Rickey Armstrong Sr, Seneca President commented on the subject by saying: “Over the past two months, we have taken extraordinary steps to protect the health and safety of our territories, our people, our workers and our guests.” He further noted: “The Nation and its gaming enterprises will implement comprehensive safety protocols informed by public health guidance and industry best practices that will exceed those of many other facilities and businesses.”</p>
<p>The enhanced safety protocols will include wearing of masks for both visitors and employees. In addition, Armstrong noted that temperature screening will be done for the workers and guests too. Personal protective gear as well as social distancing will be implemented. Last but not least, enhanced sanitization will be done. The listed rules will be applicable for all of the Nation’s properties that will reopen.</p>
<p>Armstrong did not miss to say that with phased reopening, the company will be able to oversee the properties and, if necessary, make individual adjustment of operations for certain venues. In conclusion, Armstrong pointed out that the safety will be the Nation’s guiding principle for the reopening of businesses. He also expressed excitement for welcoming back the Nation’s employees and returning the “world-class service” for the guests.</p>
