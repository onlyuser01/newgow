<p>The suspicions for match-fixing against the Swedish ice hockey team Björklöven were lifted on Thursday this week. Upon completing its investigation, the Swedish Ice Hockey Association revealed that it found no suspicion that the team or any individual within the team participated in match-fixing.</p>
<p>Björklöven Cleared from Any Suspicion of Match-Fixing</p>
<p>The Swedish ice hockey team Björklöven announced that it has been cleared of all suspicion of match-fixing on Thursday this week. The club was under investigation after a game it played against Mora on Monday. The Swedish Ice Hockey Association revealed that it completed the investigation and found “no suspicion whatsoever that Björklöven or any individual within Björklöven participated in match-fixing”.</p>
<p>According to Abbe Torsleff, Swedish Ice Hockey Association’s Head of Security, the investigation found that deviations in betting odds movements occurred from manual error at a betting company. Consequently, Björklöven was cleared of all suspicion of match-fixing.</p>
<p>Torsleff thanked all involved parties for the cooperation in recent days. In conclusion, he outlined that he is glad that with the help of all collected evidence and facts, a conclusion was made which frees the team from all suspicion of irregularities.</p>
<p>What Led to the Investigation?</p>
<p>The suspicion of match-fixing came after a match between Björklöven and Mora on Monday. After Björklöven was leading 3-0, Mora scored eight goals and in the end, won with a score 8-4.</p>
<p>Considering how unexpectedly the game had changed, some betting operators even decided to remove the game from the betting boards. Seeing the unusual odds movement, Svenska Spel too decided to temporarily pause the winnings. Consequently, the investigation was launched.</p>
<p>After the team was cleared from all suspicions on match-fixing, Anders Blomberg, CEO of Björklöven, said in a statement that now is the time for the team to look forward and focus on the upcoming challenges such as the game against AIK. Furthermore, he added: “I want to thank all those who have stood by our side through this“. In conclusion, Blomberg outlined that he hopes that this event will only make the club stronger and bring the fans and the team together.</p>
