<p>Los Angeles FC vs Los Angeles Galaxy is arguably the most interesting matchup of the second round of the 2022 MLS Playoffs. LAFC got straight into Round 2 after finishing in the #1 spot in the Western Conference in the regular season. Galaxy, who finished fifth, had to play against Nashville SC in Round 1. They won 1-0, thus booking the quarterfinal clash with their intercity rivals.</p>

<p>Los Angeles FC Offense Looking Great</p>
<p>LAFC is probably the best team in the entire MLS (or even in entire North America). Their strongest weapon is their offense, where they got players like Gareth Bale, Cristian Tello, and Carlos Vela, all of whom have plenty of experience playing for elite clubs in Europe. Then, there’s also Cristian Arango, a Colombian forward who’s their scoring leader in the 2022 MLS season.</p>
<p>Their defense, however, hasn’t been that great this season. In the regular season, LAFC conceded a total of 38 goals, which isn’t bad at all. In fact, that makes their defensive average just over one goal allowed per game. The problem is that, even though they don’t concede too many goals, they do concede often – we saw them allow at least a goal in each of their previous five games.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Galaxy Hoping for an Upset</p>
<p>Los Angeles Galaxy have a pretty decent record against their city rivals. In the 10 LAFC vs Galaxy games played since the start of the decade, their record is 5-2-3. Unfortunately for them, oddsmakers don’t think they’re going to win once again.</p>
<p>They’re seen as big underdogs in Thursday’s game, despite the fact that they’ve been playing amazing soccer lately. Galaxy are without a loss in the MLS since mid-September, with four wins and one draw in their previous five games.</p>
<p>They look strong in all areas of the game, but they’re probably not strong enough to beat such a good team as LAFC.</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC vs Los Angeles Galaxy Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that the Los Angeles Derby is going to be a real spectacle. We’re going to see plenty of goals on Thursday evening, with LAFC scoring at least one goal more than Galaxy.</p>
<p>Picks: Los Angeles FC to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
