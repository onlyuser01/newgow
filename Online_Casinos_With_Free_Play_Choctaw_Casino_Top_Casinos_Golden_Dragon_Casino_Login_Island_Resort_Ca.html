<p>Bragg Gaming Group, a global gaming technology and content group behind several notable B2B iGaming companies, has introduced changes to its team. Christina Romero, one of the group’s directors recently resigned from the company. As a result, Bragg will add the experienced Mark Clayton as a replacement.</p>
<p>Clayton Joins Bragg’s Board</p>
<p>Romero resigned with immediate effect to explore other opportunities. Since Bragg was reluctant to have a vacant seat on its board, it immediately found a replacement. Mark Clayton brings years of experience in law and gaming and will be a valuable addition to Bragg Gaming’s team.</p>
<p>Clayton is a law specialist who also has significant experience in business and gambling. In 2005 Clayton became the chief of corporate securities division of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the state’s gambling regulator. This helped him greatly enhance his knowledge about the gambling ecosystem.</p>
<p>In 2014, Clayton joined Greenberg Traurig, a law company, where he got the chance to work with some of the most notable gambling operators in the US market. He got to help clients such as Caesars Entertainment, 888 Holdings, Flutter Entertainment, DraftKings, Entain and Las Vegas Sands, among others.</p>
<p>Clayton has also worked as a member of the compliance committees of several notable gaming companies. This includes The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Caesars, and most recently Palm Resorts Casino.</p>
<p>Chairman Godfrey Welcomed the New Member</p>
<p>As a part of Bragg Gaming Group, Clayton will join experienced industry veterans such as chairman Paul Godfrey, Holly Gagnon, Paul Pathak, Rob Godfrey and vice chair Matevž Mazij.</p>
<p>Paul Godfrey, the board’s chairman, welcomed Clayton to the company. He lauded the appointee as “one of the most accomplished attorneys” in the entire gaming industry. Godfrey noted that Clayton’s career saw him provide legal and strategic advice for decades and emphasized that the new director has worked with some of the most influential companies in gaming.</p>
<p>Mark’s wealth of expertise and experience will serve us well as we continue to execute on our global B2B iGaming expansion initiatives. We are very pleased to welcome Mark to the board. Paul Godfrey, chair, Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming has been heavily focusing on expanding its business with new content. Two weeks ago, the group rolled out new content in Ontario thanks to a deal with Rush Street Interactive. A month ago, Bragg also expanded its content in the Netherlands via Fair Play. Around that time, the company launched its Spin games in Connecticut.</p>
<p>In late June, Bragg helped Kalamba Games launch some of its games in the United States.</p>
