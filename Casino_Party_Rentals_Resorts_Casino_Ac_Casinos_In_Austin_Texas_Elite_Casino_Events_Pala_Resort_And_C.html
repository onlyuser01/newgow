<p>Hello Reddog Casino and Petronela,</p>
<p>I am in receipt of correspondence from Red Dog and so far Red Dog has been right on time with their processing and correspondence as per their website's detailed notes about payout methods and timelines. I just submitted the form for my bitcoin wallet as per their instructions this morning.</p>
<p>As I told Petronela, this is my very first online casino experience. I've only occasionally played at land based casinos in the past and therefore I am very green in my knowledge of everything related to online casinos.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to point out a very interesting thing that I discovered: Once Red Dog Casino approved my very first pay out of $2500 to my credit card, their email said it may take UP TO 10 business days to show up on my credit card. However, I just checked this morning and it appears that the very first $2500 has already been credited to my credit card (well ahead of the timeline in their approval email). So, that means Red Dog Casino is processing payments in an efficient manner and according to the terms they specified on their website.</p>
<p>So far, everything that Red Dog said on their website has turned out to be accurate (up to this point).</p>
<p>...With all of the above being said, the only "WISH" I had -- and it is a wish at this point since Red Dog is doing exactly what they said they would do -- is if I could somehow get approved for a VIP status so that I can both deposit and withdraw larger amounts. I would also like to bet higher amounts (higher limit tables), but again, that is just a personal wish. I'm not sure if it will be possible in the future, but I would love to be considered for higher deposit/withdrawal/betting limits. The land based casinos I recall visiting in the past all had higher table limits of up to $5000 and $10,000 for normal players (and I believe their VIP guests get much, much higher limits). Again, this is just a "wish" and it is NOT a complaint of any kind.</p>
<p>...But thanks again Petronela and Red Dog Casino for all of your help in keeping me informed of the process and in following up with me at every stage. I really, really appreciate the service from Casino Guru and Red Dog Casino and once the entire process is over, I will gladly write a review (on this website) highlighting the experience i have had so far with Red Dog Casino. As a newbie, I think I can offer a lot of insight to other "newbies" about what to expect going from a land based casino to an online casino. Plus, Red Dog has one of my favorite games (it's a pure chance/pure luck game, but it's so much fun). That could be a separate review all unto itself!</p>
<p>Any way, thanks again for everything. I am very appreciative. Keep up the good work.</p>
