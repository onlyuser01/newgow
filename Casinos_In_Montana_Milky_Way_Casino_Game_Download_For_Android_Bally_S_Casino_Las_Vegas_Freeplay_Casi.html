<p>The fast-growing iGaming operator, Rootz Ltd, announced its entry into the German regulated gambling market. Last week, the company said that it entered the market as one of the first operators. The entry comes after Rootz received a license to operate online slot games in Germany.</p>
<p>To enter the regulated gambling market and offer its services, the operator had to meet requirements set by the State Treaty, the statewide gambling law. Lawmakers passed the State Treaty on Gambling last year in the summer. A prime goal of the new law is to regulate the gambling activities such as online slot machines but also protect players as well as children.</p>
<p>Complying with the State Treaty allows Rootz to legally introduce its online slot machines for customers in Germany. This marks a major step for the company, considering it is among the first Malta-based operators to gain access to the market.</p>
<p>In a statement released on September 22, 2022, the company revealed that it will now launch three brands that will offer legal and safe services in Germany. What's more, Rootz acknowledged that its brands will comply with all technical requirements as well as player and youth protection regulations.</p>
<p>Rootz Ltd's CEO, Lasse Rantala, commented by saying: "We are very pleased to meet the high requirements of the new State Treaty on Gambling with wildz.de, wheelzgames.de and spinz.de and to launch our brands nationwide in autumn 2022."</p>
<p>It was back in 2018 when seasoned iGaming industry experts founded Rootz. Since then, the company has been continuously growing. Primarily, Rootz focuses on the quality of its content rather than the quantity. The company has a dedicated team of professionals that fuse highly-popular trends along with state-of-the-art graphics, delivering entertaining and safe products.</p>
<p>Currently, Rootz is licensed and regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). Besides Germany, the company caters to customers in other major markets in Europe and around the world.</p>
<p>During the 2022 SBC Summit this year, Rootz was among the companies that received an award. Last week, the company revealed that it was recognized as the winner of the 2022 SBC Award for Innovation in Casino and Gaming Entertainment.</p>
<p>But Rootz did not only collect an award from the 2022 SBC Summit. The company was awarded Best Use of Technology at the 12th annual Women in Games (WiG) Diversity &amp; Employee Wellbeing Awards, a prestigious event that took place at London's famous Savoy Hotel.</p>
