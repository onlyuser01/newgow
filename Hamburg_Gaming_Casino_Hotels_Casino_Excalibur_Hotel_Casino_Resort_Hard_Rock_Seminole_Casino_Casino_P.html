<p>The discrimination lawsuit gained traction with the defense of the Council of Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey asking for dismissal by revealing counter allegations</p>
<p>Back in April 2022, Neva Pryor, an expert with extensive experience in problem gambling, filed a lawsuit against the Council of Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey (CCG), claiming she was subjected to racial discrimination. In her lawsuit, she claimed that Fred Hogan, a former president of the CCG, made racial comments against her.</p>
<p>The lawsuit’s plaintiff is of African American heritage, while Hogan is Caucasian. Pryor claimed that Hogan engaged in discussions in a “rude and condescending manner” at some point after being appointed CCG president in 2016.</p>
<p>Additionally, the plaintiff claimed he did not treat other Caucasian workers the same way. Allegedly, Hogan scrutinized Pryor, and even enforced rules that impacted her daily work. As an example, the plaintiff claimed the former executive did not allow her to discuss matters with different members of the CCG board, something that was a part of her job description.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims Pryor was subjected to a racist comment back in 2018. During a Christmas party of the CCG in December of that year, Hogan allegedly told her “Don’t let me get Black with you,” as she was walking near him.</p>
<p>The legal claim follows a racial discrimination complaint filed with the vice president of the CCG board by Pryor on February 15, 2021. Only five months after this complaint was filed, the Council did not renew its contract with the gambling addiction expert.</p>
<p>Defense Claims Misconduct by Plaintiff</p>
<p>Lawyers of the CCG presented their side of the story, asking for the court to dismiss the lawsuit. According to the defense, the alleged racial discrimination treatment against Pryor did not impact her employment. In fact, they claimed she was subject to multiple performance reviews with positive outcomes and resulted in pay raises.</p>
<p>Moreover, CCG’s defense explained: “Further, even if one were to assume that Hogan made one race-based comment to Pryor in December 2018, this is clearly insufficient to constitute behavior so severe/pervasive as to alter the conditions of employment or render the working environment hostile or abusive.”</p>
<p>Besides the pay raises, CCG’s lawyers raised counter allegations, claiming that the Council reviewed her discrimination complaint filed in February 2021 and found out about misconduct by Pryor. Allegedly, she engaged in “a myriad of improper / inappropriate conduct,” including using vulgar expressions, inappropriate language and name-calling. According to CCG’s defense court filings, Pryor insulted one former employee by calling him a “motherf***er.”</p>
<p>The legal case is currently ongoing.</p>
