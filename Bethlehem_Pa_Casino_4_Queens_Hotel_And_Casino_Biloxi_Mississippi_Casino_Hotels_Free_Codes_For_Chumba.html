<p>British lottery players did not have a bad year all in all. Overall, the National Lottery made 360 participants millionaires, with many more prizes paid out to small-time winners throughout 2021. The lottery registered a strong uptake in winning tickets bought despite growing economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Lottery Mints One Millionaire a Day</p>
<p>Based on the results, this means that the lottery made a millionaire each year of the calendar 2021. The lottery paid out over £4.7 billion to a total of 853 players, who received prizes worth at least £50,000 throughout the year.</p>
<p>The lottery made sure to offer a detailed breakdown and insight into consumer habits and who the luckiest lottery players are based on various socio-economical criteria. As it turns out, builders managed to bag the bulk of the winnings, followed by transport drivers, engineers, and care workers.</p>
<p>Not all have been forthcoming with their winnings, though, with the EuroMillions jackpot winners who bagged £122 million and £111 million respectively, preferring to stay out of the public’s eye.</p>
<p>The National Lottery senior winners’ advisor Andy Carter hailed 2021 as a remarkable year for gamblers everywhere across the country. The dedicated team handling winners at the lottery has been working hard to make sure that lucky customers are getting all the assistance they need coming in possession of what is a remarkable wealth. Carter added:</p>
<p>“We have been able to bring joy to hundreds of households and we can’t wait to meet at least 10 more newly-made millionaires.” National Lottery senior winners’ advisor Andy Carter</p>
<p>A Long-Standing Record of Rewarding Players</p>
<p>It gets even better when you consider that since the National Lottery launched in 1994, it has paid out £45 billion. It has done good to both the individual winners and the public purse, as the tax proceeds from lottery sales have been directed at various social sectors.</p>
<p>The National Lottery-funded athletes who have been able to win 189 medals from the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, a milestone well worth celebrating and an example that responsible gambling can have great benefits on society.</p>
<p>There have been a few anecdotal cases, too. Two criminals, who stole a person’s bank card data and used it to buy a winning scratch ticket, ended up in jail after they kicked up a fuss that the lottery would not let them bag the prize. They even turned to the tabloids to get the public on their side, but things did not go well from there on in.</p>
