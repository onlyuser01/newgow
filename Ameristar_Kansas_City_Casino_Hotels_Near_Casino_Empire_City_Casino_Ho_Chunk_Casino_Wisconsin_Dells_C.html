<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I know very well that the casinos can neither do anything nor have any idea about the slots .... basically they can do nothing and are out of place. I find it sad that such people are used as support, they copy you any texts and have no idea of the matter nor can they prove that something is going right ...</p>
<p>I think it outrageous that you get a relatively high win as a new customer with the first deposit and then the entire profit no matter what use no matter how many times you reopen the session to 99% loses everything. This has nothing to do with a RTP or luck but this is the software deposited in the slots program that always lets the casinos win.</p>
<p>There are casinos that sometimes pay winnings and where the software seems to run less abzokkermäßig, but most go for 100% profit and zokken from .... there can be as much RTP as it wants ....</p>
<p>The slot provide dare not out of their holes out but refer to the casinos ....</p>
<p>best regards</p>
<p>But as long as no casino manages to transparently show players that they do not rip off or that what they are telling is true, one can only speak of systematic licensed fraud allowed, at least in many casinos ....</p>
<p>It is so lying to all who say something else.</p>
