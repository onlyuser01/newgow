<p>Playtika Holding Corp launches IPO in an attempt to boost its valuation to $10 billion and capitalize on gaming trend</p>
<p>Playtika Launches IPO</p>
<p>Israeli gaming company Playtika Holding Corp has launched an initial public offering in the US to further boost its growth and capitalize on the growing demand for mobile gaming.</p>
<p>The company is attempting to raise $1.67 billion and thus increase its total valuation to nearly $10 billion. Playtika, which is owned by a Chinese investor group, will sell 69.5 million shares at $22 to $24 a piece.</p>
<p>The company hopes to capitalize on two recent developments on the market: the upsurge for listings in the US last year and the rapidly growing demand for video games. The increase is, of course, a result of the pandemic and accompanying lockdown measures. Consumers spend most of their time at home, which in turn boosts the need for entertainment, such as video games.</p>
<p>Timing is Everything</p>
<p>Playtika designs and casino and slot-based gambling games for over 35 million monthly users. While these kinds of games are not new, they certainly saw a big spike in profitability and interest last year.</p>
<p>In fact, many jurisdictions across the globe have turned to online gambling and betting as a new source of income to fill in their budget shortfalls. Some recent examples include Portugal and Spain. The Philippines, on the other hand, is looking into e-cockfights.</p>
<p>The timing of Playtika’s IPO is a bit unfortunate, however. As previously mentioned, Playtika is owned by a group of Chinese investors, including Giant Network Group Co Ltd and Yunfeng Capital.</p>
<p>The IPO comes during a time of heightened scrutiny and tighter regulations and norms against Chinese firms. Three Chinese companies were delisted from the US stock exchange market only three days prior to Playtika’s IPO.</p>
<p>The company plans on listing itself as “PLTK” on the Nasdaq.</p>
