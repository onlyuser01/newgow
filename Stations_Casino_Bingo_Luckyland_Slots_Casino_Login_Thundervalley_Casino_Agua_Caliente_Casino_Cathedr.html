<p>Sports betting services provider Kambi Group plc and Canada’s top casino operator Great Canadian Entertainment are joining forces in an agreement that spans multiple years.</p>
<p>Kambi Supports Great Canadian in Launching 10 Sportsbooks Across Ontario Casino Venues</p>
<p>Kambi is going to provide its cutting-edge retail sportsbook services to 10 out of the 12 casino and entertainment venues Great Canadian operates in Canada’s Ontario province as per a new partnership agreement the two companies signed in October.</p>
<p>Great Canadian will launch sportsbooks across 10 of its establishments in Ontario with the help of Kambi. Pickering Casino Resort, which is the latest addition to Great Canadian’s portfolio of casinos in Ontario, is also included in the partnership.</p>
<p>Kambi’s sportsbook solution is renowned for its high performance which will be a great asset for Great Canadian. Under the new partnership, Kambi is also going to provide its innovative sports betting kiosks to Great Canadian’s new sportsbooks. Their most prominent feature is the fully customizable digital signature.</p>
<p>As the new partnership comes toward the end of this year, it will have an insignificant impact on Kambi’s financial results for the fiscal year. However, it is going to reflect in a more sizable way on Kambi’s revenue in 2023.</p>
<p>Executives from Both Companies Express Their Excitement about the New Collaboration</p>
<p>Kambi’s CEO and co-founder Kristian Nylén said he was delighted to partner with Great Canadian which is a major player in the Canadian gambling market with an unparalleled presence in the retail sector.</p>
<p>Nylén also added: “This underlines our position as the leading multi-channel sportsbook provider in North America and we are looking forward to working with the talented team at Great Canadian to deliver a market-leading sportsbook experience for its patrons.”</p>
<p>Great Canadian CEO Tony Rodio also highlighted the importance of the partnership with Kambi by noting that the introduction of sports wagering in 10 of their casino properties is a major milestone that will improve and enhance the entertainment and gambling experience the guests at these venues have.</p>
<p>Rodio also expressed his gratitude towards Kambi and also towards Ontario’s gambling regulator, the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, Alcohol and Gaming Commission, and Ontario’s provincial government for the continued support during this complicated process of being the first casino operator to introduce retail sports betting in Ontario.</p>
<p>The partnership with Kambi aligns with Great Canadian’s recent rebranding and its strategic goals to enhance its retail gaming and hospitality product offerings across Canada.</p>
