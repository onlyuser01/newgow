    <h1>Las Vegas Casino Resorts Game Casino Seven Mile Casino In Chula Vista Casino Open Near Me Hotels Nea</h1>

<p>LeoVegas Group is pivoting towards Poland where the iGaming company is now setting up a new tech hub that will help it continue to bring more innovation and progress to the industry. Poland is not a chance pick either. Places such as Krakow and Warsaw already host or have hosted prominent development studios, including NetEnt’s Krakow offices.</p>
<p>Creating New Tech Opportunities out of Warsaw</p>
<p>Operating out of Stockholm, LeoVegas Group is now launching its new development hub in Warsaw, the capital. The hub will feature 60 new developers who will help the company build a next-generation platform that can be deployed across the company’s all assets, from sportsbooks to online casino platforms. This comes amid surging financial results for the company.</p>
<p>The tech hub developers in Warsaw will work with their colleagues from across Europe, including Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Presently, the hub is tasked with the development of a new proprietary platform by the name of Rhino, which is a player account management (PAM) initiative.</p>
<p>Rhino will facilitate a number of processes for the company, including the management of player data, transactions, engagement, and protection. Once off the assembly line, Rhino will be deployed across LeoVegas’ extensive portfolio of brands. Commenting on this launch, LeoVegas Group chief product and tech officer Mattias Wedar said:</p>
<p>“Our new hub in Warsaw is a key part of our strategy to stay right at the forefront of innovation, new product development, and payments while offering a highly personalized experience to our customers. Our new hub will kickstart this next phase of development.” LeoVegas Group chief product and tech officer Mattias Wedar</p>
<p>Technology Remains Core Focus for LeoVegas</p>
<p>The company remains fully focused on technological development as it believes it will pave the way for future successful ventures. One-third of LeoVegas’ workforce is currently working on various technological projects for the company, with the number expected to grow as LeoVegas continues to expand and deploy new brands and solutions. LeoVegas secured an entry in Ontario earlier this month, marking a historic move for the company, which will now be allowed to work as an online operator in the market.</p>
