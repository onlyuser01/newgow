    <h1>Wind Creek Hotel And Casino Montgomery Alabama Limitless Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes For Existing</h1>

<p>Swedish-based sports betting and online gambling affiliate company, Leadstar Media, announced Tuesday that it received a license in Virginia. The company received an affiliate license to operate in the Old Dominion and consequently launched four websites that are focused on sports betting.</p>
<p>Leadstar Media Is Now Licensed in Virginia</p>
<p>Legalized in April 2020, Virginia launched its sports betting market in January this year. While sports betting around the US continues to grow, Leadstar Media’s latest move reaffirms that the company plans to further increase its presence and enter new jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Besides Virginia, the company is licensed to offer its services legally in other key markets such as Colorado, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, to name a few. Moreover, this year Leadstar sought to increase its presence in the US by developing new and existing products for the market. The company had backed up its US expansion plan by creating a strong team as well.</p>
<p>“Leadstar Media is set to acquire licenses in further states that are already regulated.” Leadstar Media</p>
<p>Currently, sports betting is live and legal in more than 35 US states thanks to PASPA’s repeal back in 2018. The more jurisdictions legalize and launch the activity, the bigger the market would get. Projections show that the US is set to become one of the biggest if not the biggest online betting market in the world. As Leadstar is looking to further expand, the company said that acquiring new licenses in more US states will remain a key objective in 2022.</p>
<p>According to Leadstar, the four US-focused websites: Unitedgamblers.com, Sportsbooksonline.com, Bookiesbonuses.com/us, and Bettingscanner.com can provide more information such as payment methods, bonuses, legality, and more.</p>
<p>The Old Dominion Is the Sixth State Where Leadstar Is Fully Licensed</p>
<p>Leadstar Media’s CEO, Eskil Kvarnström, said that the company is excited to enter Virginia. He explained that this is the sixth US state where the company is fully licensed. Kvarnström acknowledged that entering Virginia after the company has been focused primarily on the US market puts a successful end of 2021.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to announce our entry into Virginia, the sixth U.S state where we are fully licensed.” Eskil Kvarnström, CEO at Leadstar Media</p>
<p>According to Leadstar’s CEO, a key priority for the company next year would be to “assert ourselves as the top sportsbook comparison affiliate in Virginia.” In conclusion, he outlined that Leadstar’s US-facing products are prepared in line with the company’s expansion plans to enter new jurisdictions in 2022.</p>
