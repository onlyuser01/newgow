<p>For example, the Wild symbol may substitute for any other symbol in the game bar the Scatter. There is also a potential 10,000x multiplierbased on your base bet, adding to the excitement. By landing Scatter symbols, you will get to benefit even more as there are up to eight free spins you may claim yourself.</p>
<p>If you end up landing more Scatter Symbols during a free spin round, you stand to benefit from an extra free spin as well. Pragmatic Play is particularly proud of its latest addition as Secret City of Gold makes it possible for players to have a blast from start to finish.</p>
