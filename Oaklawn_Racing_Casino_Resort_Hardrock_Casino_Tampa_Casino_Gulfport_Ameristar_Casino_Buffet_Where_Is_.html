<p>Pragmatic Play and Stake.com will be pushing the envelope of live casino gaming with a new bespoke product the partners have revealed. Pragmatic Play, which has an extensive footprint in the development of various igaming products, and has built some of the most compelling live casino games will collaborate with the world’s leading cryptocurrency betting and gaming website to create an even more memorable product.</p>
<p>Pragmatic and Stake to Create a Dedicated Live Studio</p>
<p>Under the terms of the partnership, the companies will create a 12-table live game studio that will feature Stake.com branding and use Pragmatic’s expertise to create immersive live experiences. There will be a total of 10 blackjack tables with one allocated for roulette and baccarat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Stake co-founder Edward Craven acknowledged how important Pragmatic’s contributions to the live gaming sector have been over the past year. Pragmatic has made a clear commitment to meeting all of Stake’s expectations which is what sealed the deal in the end, Craven confirmed. “We look forward to it going live and really highlighting the unique capabilities of our brand,” he concluded.</p>
