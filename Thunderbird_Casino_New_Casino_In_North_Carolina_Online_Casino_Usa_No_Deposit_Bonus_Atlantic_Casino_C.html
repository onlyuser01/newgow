    <h1>Thunderbird Casino New Casino In North Carolina Online Casino Usa No Deposit Bonus Atlantic Casino C</h1>

<p>I signed up for Vulcan Vegas and played with the first deposit bonus.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I won the cash part, but I have about $4400 in cash.</p>
<p>The point of contention is that I registered one Chinese character of my name incorrectly when registering the site.</p>
<p>I mistyped a character due to a mis-tap, and I didn't notice it for a while.</p>
<p>I made a deposit and played with it, and after a while, when I went to see my page to withdraw money, I typed in one wrong kanji for my name.</p>
<p>As soon as I noticed it, I made an inquiry to the live chat, and the support person replied that it could not be corrected here, and that the correction would be made by the department in charge after submitting the identity verification documents.</p>
<p>After that, after a few days, I received a KYC verification completion email, and when I tried to log in, my account was frozen.</p>
<p>5.3 of the terms was brought out and the account was frozen, but it is normal for users to make incorrect entries.</p>
<p>I found the error myself and have asked the support to fix it openly.</p>
<p>It may be unavoidable if the other party found it first and pointed it out, but the result I reported myself was the confiscation and freezing of the assets.</p>
<p>Even if I sent an inquiry by email, it was ignored, and I continued to communicate via live chat, but each person in the live chat gave a different explanation.</p>
<p>In the first inquiry before the lock was applied, the answer was that if I submitted the kyc, the department in charge would correct it.</p>
<p>After the freeze, one live chat representative unilaterally disconnected the chat without listening.</p>
<p>Another support seems to have reported to the upper part, but the account closure is decided, but as a condition to unlock as an exception, all winnings will be confiscated. It is said that if you drink this condition, you will start the cancellation procedure.</p>
<p>It's not a convincing problem, but I thought that the first thing to do was to unfreeze it, so I accepted the condition to recommend the procedure.</p>
<p>However, when I went to ask about the progress today, I was told that the account suspension was final and could not be reversed.</p>
<p>I submitted a screenshot of the past live chat and the other party admitted the error.</p>
<p>Vulcan Vegas doesn't seem to share live chat queries with support.</p>
<p>And I have no intention of investigating unless I present evidence of the exchange.</p>
<p>If I hadn't taken a screenshot of the exchange, they'd just confiscate the winnings and wouldn't bother asking about it.</p>
