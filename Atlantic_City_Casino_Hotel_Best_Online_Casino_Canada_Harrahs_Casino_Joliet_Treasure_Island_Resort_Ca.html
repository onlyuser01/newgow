<p>The partnership with AGA’s public service campaign will broaden MLB’s responsible gambling efforts alongside the new Platinum Member status of the league within the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG)’s Leadership Circle, following an expansion of MLB’s partnership with the NCPG.</p>
<p>Both partnerships that were announced during the inaugural Responsible Gaming Education Month showcased MLB’s determination to promote gaming literacy and consumer education.</p>
<p>Hailing the partnership with MLB as a “milestone for the campaign and responsible gambling efforts nationwide,” AGA senior vice president Casey Clark underscored the league’s understanding of the growing collective commitment to responsibility alongside growth in legal sports betting in the US.</p>
<p>“This partnership will have a meaningful impact, teaching fans across the country the fundamentals of responsible wagering,” Clark concluded.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, AGA will provide the league with responsible gaming counsel and expertise, including benchmarking and annual training on best practices, while MLB will deliver responsible sports betting public service announcements across its digital media channels and select broadcasts and will offer all 30 MLB clubs extended campaign partnership opportunities.</p>
<p>Kenny Gersh, executive vice president of Business Development of MLB, outlined the league’s commitment to providing its fans with all the “tools and resources necessary to bet responsibly” was growing alongside the expansion of legalized sports betting in the country.</p>
<p>“With the expertise and additional resources of the AGA and NCPG,” Gersh continued by highlighting that the league will be in a position to expand its responsible gaming efforts to drive “new education, awareness and support service initiatives” and “help keep sports betting safe, fun and entertaining.”</p>
<p>On behalf of the NCPG, the council’s executive director Keith Whyte applauded the league’s “ongoing commitment to addressing problem gambling,” looking forward to supporting MLB’s expanded efforts in delivering responsible gambling education.</p>
<p>“MLB’s extensive reach will make a significant impact in raising awareness of the National Problem Gambling Helpline and the resources available for treatment,” Whyte concluded.</p>
<p>As the first professional sports league to join the NCPG back in 2005, MLB expanded now to Platinum Member of the council’s Leadership Circle, promoting the NCPG’s National Problem Gambling Helpline and other problem gambling-related initiatives of the council across all of the league’s media platforms.</p>
