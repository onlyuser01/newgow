<p>Loto-Quebec has issued an update that it is suspending the physical sales of tickets and closing down its terminals across the province, as a response to the measures of the province government aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus /Covid-19/. The lottery ticket provider will continue its online sales and will coordinate with other lottery operators for the inter-provincial lottery sales.</p>
<p>The decision of the lottery operator is coming after the government in Quebec ordered the temporary closure of all retail betting and gaming facilities, as part of the temporary shutdown measure applied to all non-essential businesses such as restaurants, bars, cinemas, and shopping centers across the world, looking to contain the virus spread by enforcing isolation through social distancing. The temporary closure in Quebec will be valid until May 1.</p>
<p>Province Lottery Company Implements Measures Of Its Own</p>
<p>Loto-Quebec informed its clients that all tickets purchased so far would remain valid for the upcoming draws and further sales will continue online, as the company acknowledges it is the only safe way to continue operations within the current environment dominated by the social distancing outcry.</p>
<p>The lottery operator will get in contact with all of its 8,500 retailers and kiosk operators throughout the province to let them know about the new measures the company is overtaking with regards to helping contain the spread of the virus infection.</p>
<p>“With the health and wellbeing of its customers in mind, Loto-Québec, takes the current situation very seriously and will not hesitate to put into place additional measures as needed. We will inform the public as soon as possible concerning the implementation of this new measure.” Loto-Quebec</p>
<p>Ontario The Latest To Enforce Closures</p>
<p>Quebec is not the latest province in Canada to issue such measures related to the severe virus outbreak, as Ontario ordered non-essential businesses to close down beginning Tuesday, leaving open only grocery stores, pharmacies, takeout, and delivery restaurants, supply chain suppliers, and essential manufacturing industries, as well as liquor stores. The closure will be for a period of 14 days, initially, but would possibly extend, dependent on the virus situation.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the American Gaming Association /AGA/ has informed that 90% of all land-based casinos in the US are already closed down due to the coronavirus measures, warning of the huge financial impact not only on the gaming but also on the leisure and hospitality industry. In the UK, after initially taking a lighter non-restrictive approach, the government ordered all retail betting shops, as part of non-essential businesses, to close, to prevent the further transmission of the virus between clients.</p>
