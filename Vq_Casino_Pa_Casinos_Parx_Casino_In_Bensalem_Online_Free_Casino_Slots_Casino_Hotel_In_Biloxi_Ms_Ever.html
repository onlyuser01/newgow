<p>EveryMatrix has been working to significantly expand its reach in both the sports and casino verticals with the company now strengthening its SlotMatrix RGS platform offering with a new partner</p>
<p>Rogue, a prominent developer of iGaming products, has been named a SlotMatrix Exclusive Partner, which will benefit both companies. On the one hand, EveryMatrix will strengthen its portfolio and offering in the iGaming vertical while Rogue will be able to deploy what it describes as a disruptive type of slot content which will be introduced to SlotMatrix partners across the globe.</p>
<p>Rogue Becomes the Latest Innovative Addition to SlotMatrix’s Lineup</p>
<p>SlotMatrix is EveryMatrix’s leading B2B aggregator that brings relevant game content to partner operators from some of the world’s most successful and innovative studios, suppliers, and developers.</p>
<p>Rogue is a studio that is fully focused on creating games that “deviate from the standard” which is the supplier’s main development philosophy that drives and guides the creation of each individual game. Rogue has already created an impressive portfolio of titles that stand out by virtue of their unique mechanics.</p>
<p>The studio has pioneered game features such as Blockchain, Happy Returns and Turbo Reels. Some of the games that have already launched under the Rogue banner include Happily Ever After and OverDrive, with the company having a lot more content planned for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Rogue CEO John Parsonage welcomed the opportunity to become a SlotMatrix Partner. He argues that the collaboration would allow the company to showcase its game-changing content throughout EveryMatrix’s extensive network of partners and help the games reach new content.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Head of Operations RGS Games Ashley Bloor hailed the addition of Rogue, describing the latest partner as an “exciting studio” which is run by a talented creative team of developers and designers. Rogue fits perfectly with the type of studios and developers that the company has been adding.</p>
<p>Recently, SlotMatrix expanded its list of developers with BangBang, another innovative studio that is dedicated to creating fresh mechanics and gameplay experiences from scratch.</p>
