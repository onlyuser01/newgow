<p>Jeffrey Yabuki is stepping in as chairman of Sportradar’s global board of directors and will support the company’s global restructuring and push towards more tailored integrity solutions.</p>
<p>Yabuki Takes Lead in the Board</p>
<p>Sportradar is strengthening the company’s executive line with the appointment of Jeffery Yabuki as the company’s chairman of the global board of directors effectively immediately the company announced yesterday.</p>
<p>Yabuki is a well-seasoned veteran who transfers from Fiserv, a payments technology company where he worked as executive chairman of financial services, as well as a CEO before that.</p>
<p>He will be joining other company heavyweights such as Carsten Koerl, who is global chief executive, and TCV’s John Doran, among others.</p>
<p>Yabuki has expressed his confidence in Sportradar’s success and product, arguing that the company’s leading vendor of sports data intelligence responsible for upholding sports integrity worldwide, adding:</p>
<p>“I am honored to join the global board to partner with Carsten and the incredibly talented Sportradar leadership team to create differentiated value at the intersection of sports entertainment and technology leadership.” Sportradar newly-appointed global chairman of the board of director Jeffery Yabuki</p>
<p>A Global Restructuring Effort with Local Focus</p>
<p>Koerl was equally excited with Yabuki’s appointment, confirming that the company was happy to have him. He pointed out to Yabuki’s extraordinary leadership, business acumen and strategic approach, all of which have helped Fiserv establish itself as a leading financial services supplier and payment technology provider.</p>
<p>This appointment is part of a broader restructuring within the company with Sportradar upping the ante and seeking what it describes as a more localized approach. Koerl will continue to oversee business globally, but he will be supported by three regional CEOs.</p>
<p>The reorganization has seen Werner Becher step in as CEO for UK, EMEA and Latin America, backed by Arne Rees as CEO of North America. The company’s interest in Asia Pacific are protected and steered by Eduard Blonk who serves as regional CEO and reports to Koerl.</p>
<p>Sportradar has an undeniably positive effect on sports integrity. The company has helped Brazil tackle match-fixing and educate athletes and sports personalities about the dangers of the practice.</p>
<p>Match-fixing is a glaring problem in sports and sports betting and is expected to get more sophisticated in future, demanding timelier and more innovative solutions, as well as the willing participation of stakeholders.</p>
