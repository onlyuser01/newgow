    <h1>The Linq Casino Las Vegas Nevada Hotels Near Graton Casino The Lodge At Cliff Castle Casino Agua Cal</h1>

<p>I made a 250 win in this Casio a few months ago. As a result, I had to verify myself with all the trimmings. The payment then worked. Now I deposited 15 EU and wanted to play. I then entered a bonus, which didn't work. So I went live chat. I was then informed that this bonus is not for players from Germany. I was then informed of another bonus. Everything okay. Finally, they said they wanted to talk to me about a technical problem. My profile account/name would not match my ID. I didn't even know what was meant. Eventually I was accused of cheating. Until I figured it out. I mistyped my birthday when registering. A bit of transposed digits. And next to my name was my nickname, which was already there as a username. When entering my automatic entry help was triggered. I noticed all this when I pressed save. I wanted to correct it immediately, but I couldn't. Anyway, I clarified that with the chat and should be changed. I didn't look and then forgot. After months I had this gain of 250 EU and I was not told anything like that it is not right there. I felt like I had to submit my documents a hundred times. Over and over again. With a selfie and all the trimmings. I understand the whole thing with verifying that everything is correct. But if you have to constantly upload everything again and I'm told nothing of the sort has arrived then that's strange too. But after a few weeks everything worked out. Now, months later, I had forgotten the whole thing again, I then paid in these 15 EU. And suddenly I was accused of cheating. The lady in the chat didn't want to believe me that this was a mistake and that I couldn't correct it myself. Also probably not from the live chat that wanted to do this didn't interest her. I was accused of fraud. I should make a video ID. But I don't want this, because I know for sure that if I win, it won't be discussed anyway and I'll have to do it all over again. Also, I don't want to have any videos of myself on the web now. Photos do it very well from their current quality. I was so annoyed about the fraud allegation that I no longer want to support playing there at all. I would also like to have the 15 EU back although I know that casinos don't do this anyway. I find the whole thing an insult. There are now so good and ferry casinos that I no longer need a jet casino.</p>
