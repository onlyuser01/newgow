<p>Galaxy Gaming and Blueprint Gaming have entered a licensing agreement which will enable the latter to launch a new range of table games that will feature Side Bets, a signature mechanic pioneered and owned by Galaxy Gaming. The news was shared via email.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming will now use the supplier’s trademark Side Bets solution to boost engagement for the new games it has planned, and introduce it to its table games. Blueprint Gaming is confident that the addition of this mechanic will translate into a number of net positives for the company.</p>
<p>This will include better engagement, a boost in popularity, and retention across the board. The Galaxy Side Bets feature will be incorporated into Blueprint Gaming products starting in the second quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming is not shy about its ambitions with Side Bet. The studio will be bringing this feature and the games it is incorporated in across all jurisdictions the company's currently licensed to operate in.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming Director of Key Accounts and Marketing UK Joe Purvis has welcomed the opportunity to enhance the company’s games with a new feature that will lead to even better engagement across the board.</p>
<p>Purvis said that Blueprint Gaming feels confident that the Side Bets feature is designed to help encourage growth and player engagement, and this is precisely why the company will be deploying it.</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming Director of iGaming Jason McCulloch was similarly open-armed about the deal, arguing that the partnership will also see the deployment of Galaxy Gaming content such as 21+3, Perfect Pairs, Lucky Ladies, Buster Blackjack, and others, as part of Blueprint’s offer.</p>
<p>"These games represent some of the most popular side bet titles in the world and we look forward to seeing them thrill players across the globe," McCulloch explained. Apart from this partnership with Galaxy Gaming, Blueprint Gaming has been very active with other prominent companies from the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>The company struck a content alliance with Light &amp; Wonder in October and rolled out its content with NorthStar Bets in January. The launch with the operator in Ontario, Canada, has allowed the company to further expands its geographical reach. Now, Blueprint partners stand to also benefit from the forthcoming Side Bets games.</p>
