    <h1>Casino Le Film River City Casino Casino Laughlin Miami Casino Club Lake Charles Casino Bundesliga Be</h1>

<p>If you’re not too familiar with what’s going on in the German top tier, here’s a Bundesliga betting preview you might find useful.</p>
<p>There are three Bundesliga matches on the program on Sunday, May 24. The games might not seem too interesting at first glance, but each of them can be crucial for the teams involved. They can also be great for betting.</p>
<p>Schalke vs Augsburg</p>
<p>When Bundesliga went on the break due to COVID-19 pandemic, Schalke was in the sixth place, the one that leads to the Europa League. However, this team’s first post-lockdown game did not go well. Schalke got hammered by Borussia Dortmund.</p>
<p>The final score was 4:0, which is embarrassing enough, but things could’ve gone even worse for Schalke. Their goalkeeper saved a couple of shots, while some Dortmund players missed the target on a few occasions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, David Wagner’s boys need to do much better in the upcoming matches if they want to play in one of two continental competitions next year. Luckily for them, their fixture list seems easy. In the next four rounds, Schalke is playing teams from the bottom half of the table – Augsburg, Dusseldorf, Werder Bremen, and Union Berlin.</p>
<p>The problem is that the boys in blue haven’t been too great in the attacking department. In fact, there are only four teams in the league which have scored fewer goals than Schalke.</p>
<p>On the bright side, this team has been pretty decent at the back. Actually, the 4:0 defeat to Dortmund last Saturday was one of the most embarrassing moments of the entire season. Another good news for them is that they’re playing a team that’s been in a very poor run.</p>
<p>Augsburg is without a win since the first day of February when they beat Werder Bremen. After that, they lost five matches and drew one, allowing 15 goals and scoring only four.</p>
<p>Pick: Schalke (-102)</p>
<p>Mainz vs RB Leipzig</p>
<p>Last Sunday, RB Leipzig slipped against Freiburg, playing a 1:1 draw and dropping to the fourth place in the Bundesliga table. You got to feel sorry for this team as they were attacking with all they got in that match.</p>
<p>At one point in the game, the RB Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann had four classic attackers on the pitch, but that didn’t help his team find the net more than once. In fact, that decision almost cost RB Leipzig gravely. Freiburg scored a game from a counter-attack, but VAR ruled it out due to offside.</p>
<p>This time, RB Leipzig has an easier task as Mainz is not as good as Freiburg. Scoring a couple of goals against this side should not be a major problem as Mainz has allowed 55 goals already. Only one team (Werder Bremen) has conceded more.</p>
<p>Pick: RB Leipzig (-208); Over 2.5 goals (-128)</p>
<p>FC Koln vs Dusseldorf</p>
<p>If there were a dictionary entry for ‘mid-table Bundesliga team’ FC Koln’s logo would’ve been there. This team is currently in 10th place with 33 points. They got nothing to worry about relegation. At the same time, their chances of qualifying for one of the continental competitions are very, very slim.</p>
<p>As a result, FC Koln can relax and enjoy the rest of the season. Dusseldorf, on the other hand, is ahead of some stressful times. The team is in 16th place, which is the one that leads to the relegation play-off. If Dusseldorf finishes the season in that place, they will have to face the no.3 team from Bundesliga II.</p>
<p>The trouble is that Dusseldorf’s playoff rival might be Stuttgart or Hamburger SV, both of which are pretty good teams. This is why the best scenario for Dusseldorf would be if they managed to leapfrog Mainz in the 15th place. For that to happen, this team needs to start winning games.</p>
<p>Pick: Double Chance Dusseldorf/Draw (-110)</p>
