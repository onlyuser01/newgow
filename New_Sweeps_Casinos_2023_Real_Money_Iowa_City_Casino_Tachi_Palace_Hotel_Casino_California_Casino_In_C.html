<p>MrQ, one of the fastest-growing online casino brands in the United Kingdom, is now going to double down on its content offer by bringing more trusted and player-favorite live casino products. To this end, the company is partnering with OnAir Entertainment, a supplier of some of the best titles in the vertical, along with innovative game shows and classic games, Casino Guru News learned via email press release.</p>
<p>The partnership will significantly strengthen MrQâ€™s standing in the regulated gaming market in the United Kingdom and help the brand to bring products to its customers that are worthwhile, fun, and out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>MrQ has been able to already establish its reputation as a forward-thinking casino that is always looking to tap into fresh experiences for its players. The addition of OnAir Entertainment will further strengthen this reputation, and help the operator build its legacy.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment will bring traditional experiences, such as roulette and blackjack, but also feature some of its more innovative titles, including Card Matchup and Nexus Roulette. Company Chief Commercial Officer James Jones welcomed this opportunity and said that he was thrilled to see the live studio supplier partner with MrQ in a bid to further revolutionize the gambling landscape.</p>
<p>"Through our state-of-the-art technologies, we offer bespoke experiences to our partners, and in collaboration with MrQ, we will push the boundaries of industry standards, enhancing players' satisfaction to extraordinary degrees," Jones added.</p>
<p>MrQ Gaming Operations Manager Aaron Braund was similarly excited and receptive to the opportunity. He called OnAir Entertainment a company that was a natural pick for the brand. "Together, we anticipate further growth in our live casino vertical and look forward to a prosperous partnership," Braund added.</p>
<p>Previously, MrQ also teamed up with Pragmatic Play, once again with a focus on the live casino experience. Apart from strengthening its portfolio of live games, MrQ has also reached out to some of the most prominent suppliers in the industry to bolster its slots portfolio as well, bringing games by Push Gaming over the past months as well.</p>
<p>In the meantime, OnAir Entertainment has similarly strengthened its presence in regulated markets with the company announcing some ambitious plans for its live casino games over the past months. For example, OnAir Entertainment confirmed that it is looking to expand with brand-new studios in the United States this year.</p>
<p>The company also said that it is interested in building its presence in Romania and launched a new dedicated studio to help the firm service its markets.</p>
