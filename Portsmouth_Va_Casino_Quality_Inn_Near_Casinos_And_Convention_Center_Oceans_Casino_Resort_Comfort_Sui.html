<p>Manchester City vs Manchester United a.k.a. the Manchester Derby is one of the fiercest rivalries in the Premier League. The rivalry started 141 years ago, and since, the two have met 187 times. The Red Devils lead the series 77-53-57, but most of their wins happened before Sheikh Mansur became the owner of Manchester City.</p>
<p>One of the first things he did when he took charge was to appoint Pep Guardiola as the boss of the sky Blues. With the Spanish manager at the helm, the Citizens are 11-3-6 against their archrivals. Judging by the betting odds, they’re likely to add another win to the list on Sunday.</p>

<p>Manchester City Players Look Much Better Than Their City Rivals</p>
<p>Manchester City is one of the only two Premier League teams that are still undefeated in the 2022-23 season. Guardiola’s men have a 5-2-0 record and a score differential of 23-6, which is the best in the league.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that almost 50% of those goals (48% to be precise) were scored by Erling Haaland. The 22-year-old striker has put away 11 goals in the Prem, which makes him the scoring leader in the league. The most impressive fact is that he’s scored five goals more than the two players just behind him on the EPL top-scorers list.</p>
<p>Can Man United Defense Handle Haaland?</p>
<p>Manchester United are 4-0-2 in the Premier League this season, with a score differential of 8-8. Their defense was their biggest problem at the start of the season – they conceded six goals in the first two games.</p>
<p>However, since then, they’ve been doing great at the back. The partnership between two center backs – Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez – seems to be working out for them, although there is a worry that they might not be able to stop Haaland on Sunday.</p>
<p>The thing is that in the previous four games, they were faced against much shorter opponents. Martinez, who is the shortest center-back in the Premier League (standing at 5’7) might not be able to deal with 6’3 Norwegian.</p>
<p>And even if Man United’s defense manages to stop Haaland, there’s a worry that their offense isn’t going to do much. With just eight goals scored in six EPL games, they’re among the worst teams attack-wise.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that Manchester City is going to destroy their city rivals on Sunday. They are simply the better team, and now that they have Haaland in the final third, they look unbeatable.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester City to win; Over 2.5 goals. Haaland to score anytime</p>
