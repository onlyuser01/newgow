<p>The first game for the NFL 2022 season is already in the books with the Buffalo Bills winning convincingly against the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday night. Now, GeoComply has been able to pick and share the first data recapping how the game went from the point of view of the US sports betting market.</p>
<p>GeoComply Posts Surging Betting Data from US States</p>
<p>According to the geolocation specialist, volumes across the country were up 77% to 22.6 million compared to 12.7 million on the opening Thursday in 2021. This percentage has gone up by quite a bit for New Jersey where GeoComply measured the post-PASPA opening game in 2018 which attracted 460,000 people compared to the 2022â€™s opening game which resulted in a 550% increase to 3 million people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New Yorkers had their first chance to bet on an NFL Kickoff game which resulted in driving 3.7 million geolocation volumes across the state. Buffalo area betting activity went up by 210% compared between September 1 and September 8, indicating that local teams do drive interest in sports betting.</p>
<p>Overall, sports betting numbers in the United States are expected to go up this NFL season. The mass legalization and rapid opening of retail and mobile sports betting options have made it possible for more adult Americans of the legal gambling age to actually place a bet.</p>
<p>In fact, the American Gaming Association estimates that no fewer than 46.6 million people in the United States will be making a bet on the 2022 NFL season this year. Sportsbooks are also eyeing the opportunity of a massive windfall.</p>
<p>Sports betting is bound to continue expanding in the United States, as 31 states and Washington, DC have live and regulated sports betting with five more states regulating it but not yet live. California is also making a dash for the finishing line, but private stakeholders and tribal operators are butting heads over the final language of the bill.</p>
