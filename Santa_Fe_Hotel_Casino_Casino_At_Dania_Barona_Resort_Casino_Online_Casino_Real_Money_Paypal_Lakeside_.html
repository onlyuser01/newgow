    <h1>Santa Fe Hotel Casino Casino At Dania Barona Resort Casino Online Casino Real Money Paypal Lakeside</h1>

<p>The shares of the leading provider of technology and services, powering betting and gaming operators, Bragg Gaming Group, increased Wednesday, after one of its largest shareholders sent a letter, supporting different business combinations, including partial or full sale of the company’s assets. The letter was sent by Jeremy Raper, the founder of Raper Capital, a company that is in charge of some 375,000 shares in Bragg and the second-largest disclosed investor in the company.</p>
<p>In his letter, sent to CEO Matevz Mazij, the expert spoke about Bragg’s acquisition of Oryx a few years ago, explaining that its current stock price is 25% lower when compared to that period. Raper acknowledged the company has seen “chronic underperformance,” regardless of its listing on NASDAQ dating back to 2021. Raper Capital’s founder explained in his letter to Bragg: “Suffice to say, the public markets have had plenty of opportunity to appraise our Company’s growth story, over time, and yet the record demonstrates that it will not, or cannot, accord even the lower bounds of what most shareholders would consider fair value.”</p>
<p>According to Raper, Bragg can ensure proper returns for the shareholders via a partial or full sale of company assets. He encouraged the company to pursue all possible strategic alternatives, including the aforementioned sale that can help maximize the value for all of its shareholders. Moreover, Raper said he believes that minority shareholders would agree that this would be the best course for Bragg.</p>
<p>“As such, it is evidently clear that a third-party sale of the business is the only way to crystallize a proper return for the underlying business value that you, and legacy management, have created.“ Jeremy Raper, founder of Raper Capital</p>
<p>Proposed Sale To “Unlock Latent Value” for Shareholders</p>
<p>Raper Capital’s founder compared the proposal to similar recent transactions within the iGaming vertical that have taken place over the last 24 months. He uncovered that on average, transactions similar to the proposed one were 19x EV/EBITDA, while a median multiple was approximately 15x EV/EBITDA.</p>
<p>Speaking about Bragg’s shares at the time of writing, Raper said that they trade barely at 5.5x EV/EBITDA. He said that even with a conservative 12x EV/EBITDA Bragg’s share would be worth $13.5 per share based on current year numbers or $18 per share on FY24E numbers.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his letter, Raper said that he plans to continue to be a long-term shareholder of Bragg. “By calling for a sale of the company now, I only seek to preserve, and finally unlock, that latent value for the benefit of all stakeholders,” he explained.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Bragg confirmed that its current chief operating officer and president, Lara Falzon, gave resignation notice. At the time of the announcement, the company confirmed that she would step down from the two roles, effective from the end of the year.</p>
