<p>OnAir Entertainment, a leading provider of live casino games, has unveiled a new game based on Gameburger’s famous 9 Pots of Gold slot. Thanks to OnAir Entertainment, the developer’s popular title will be turned into a gameshow-styled live casino offering.</p>
<p>OnAir Adapts a Famous Slot into a Live Casino Game</p>
<p>The so-called 9 Pots of Gold StreamIcon is an innovative offering that will diversify OnAir’s live casino portfolio. The game takes inspiration from Gameburger’s original slot and turns it into an engaging live experience. The game will now have a live presenter and other innovative features that will debut on the live leprechaun-themed title.</p>
<p>9 Pots of Gold StreamIcon will allow players to place a bet per spin and decide how many spins they wish to bet on. The host will then press a large physical button that triggers a spin. This novel idea will spark a new life into the beloved slot game and engage customers in a new way. In addition, the StreamIcon edition will come with spin and mega multiplier features. Other additions are free spins and a pop-up wheel offer that provides players with an extra chance to win prizes.</p>
<p>The game will be streamed from OnAir’s studio. The live casino will add a social element to the title. To further emphasize that, OnAir Entertainment will also introduce custom chat stickers, allowing players to interact and have fun. The game will debut in September, with OnAir planning to release other games within the next few months.</p>
<p>9 Pots Was the Perfect Game for StreamIcon’s Launch</p>
<p>OnAir’s business development manager, Nare Grigoryan, lauded StreamIcon as a “true innovation” in the live casino sector. According to her, the new concept will allow the company to turn every slot game into a live casino experience.</p>
<p>Grigoryan added that she believes 9 Pots of Gold is the perfect inaugural game thanks to the popularity it enjoys in multiple regions.</p>
<p>It is innovations like StreamIcon and game launches like 9 Pots of Gold StreamIcon Edition that ensure OnAir Entertainment stands out from its rivals and is also why we have quickly become the live casino provider of choice for tier-one operators and forward-thinking online casino brands. Nare Grigoryan, business development manager, OnAir Entertainment</p>
<p>Matthew Carvajal, Gameburger’s creative design lead, is honored to have 9 Pots of Gold adapted into a live casino title. He called this a “great moment” for his company and said that it has been a lot of fun to work with OnAir’s team. Carvajal concluded that he can’t wait to see how players react to the new title.</p>
