<p>The 9 a.m. meeting comes as the state’s casinos remain shuttered and gaming property executives are looking forward to finding out reopening times. Many have already authored reopening plans.</p>
<p>The workshop agenda says directives and plans for licensed casinos from Gov. Steve Sisolak and the gaming board will be discussed during the meeting.</p>
<p>Among those likely to speak is newly appointed Nevada COVID-19 Response Director Caleb Cage.</p>
<p>Caleb Cage to Address Gaming Workshop</p>
<p>Cage was named this week to the newly created director’s position. He could explain at the meeting how the office impacts the gaming sector, and his board appearance will be among his first public events as director.</p>
<p>Earlier, Cage was chief of the state’s Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security Advisor. After graduating from the US Military Academy, West Point, he served in the US Army in Germany and Iraq.</p>
<p>Later, he was executive director of the Nevada Office of Veterans Services. He also worked as an administrator in the state’s higher education system.</p>
<p>Mr. Cage has proven invaluable to the State in its effort to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Sisolak said in a statement released on Monday.</p>
<p>“Mr. Cage brings a wealth of experience that will ensure our federally supported, state managed and locally executed response plan is effective in the immediate and the long-term.”</p>
<p>Chairwoman Morgan, Health Officials to Participate</p>
<p>Also, gaming board Chairwoman Sandra Douglass Morgan will provide an update during the workshop. She played a key role in the board’s drafting of a casino reopening policy that was approved this month by the board and the Nevada Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>During a recent commission meeting, Morgan predicted that some gaming properties will submit additional regulations in their own reopening plans. She explained the commission document included “universal” policies for operations, ranging from small casinos to large venues.</p>
<p>Other workshop speakers include Mason Van Houweling, CEO at University Medical Center in Las Vegas. He will discuss UMC’s testing operations for coronavirus and partnerships with casinos. Wynn Las Vegas is among the many casino companies already using UMC for worker coronavirus testing.</p>
<p>Another speaker is Dr. Fermin Leguen, the chief medical officer and director of clinical services at the Southern Nevada Health District. He will provide an update on testing and contact tracing.</p>
<p>Clark County Fire Department Chief John Steinbeck will discuss the department’s response to the pandemic and community-based testing initiatives. Dr. Anthony Slonim, who is president and CEO of Renown Health, a regional healthcare provider, will discuss current and future testing capacity.</p>
<p>Also speaking is Dean Dow, president and CEO of the Regional Medical Services Authority (REMSA). It provides ambulance service in Washoe County, Nevada, and multistate health air transportation. He will discuss COVID-19 response capabilities.</p>
<p>The board meeting will be streamed live.</p>
