<p>ParlayBay, a provider of innovative sports betting content and games, has launched its first-ever real-money portfolio of games, which is marking the company’s branching out into new areas of the sports betting experience.</p>
<p>ParlayBay Dips Water in Real Money Games and Products</p>
<p>The launch is celebrated as a milestone, and it comes two years after ParlayBay launched in the segment. Upon joining the sector, the company promoted its free-to-play titles as a way to boost engagement and invite sports fans to explore the concept of sports wagering in a stress-free and secure environment.</p>
<p>The real money betting games will be incorporated with 7bet, which will be the first operator to welcome this new solution by the company, and which will roll out in Lithuania. ParlayBay has pioneered a number of excellent games, such as BOSS, GEKKO, CUT, RUSH, GREYHOUND and STREAK among other major releases.</p>
<p>ParlayBay brings tons of opportunities to bettors who wish to make the transition from free-to-play to real money betting options seamless. The games offered by the company offer lightning-fast markets and micro-betting opportunities, which drive player engagement for partner operators, but also focus on helping consumers better understand sports betting.</p>
<p>ParlayBay is also going to introduce its PARLAYPOWERS in 2023, which is an innovative tool designed to help partners reach out to players and leverage ParlayBay’s product offer through tailored and customizable options. The tool is going to help business drive player acquisition and retention efforts, and help launch free bets, and earlybird bonuses. Commenting on the latest launch of real money games, ParlayBay CEO Patrick Nordwall said:</p>
<p>This is a landmark achievement for us, as this is the first time in our short history that we’re able to implement real-money gaming to our thrilling titles. Commenting on the latest launch of real money games, ParlayBay CEO Patrick Nordwall</p>
<p>7Bet Welcomes the Opportunity to Work with ParlayBay Again</p>
<p>Nordwall similarly noted that this new announcement also meant a big leap forward for the company. 7bet CEO Justinas Slaizas welcomed the opportunity as well and said that the operator was stoked to provide players with innovative products that appeal to player bases.</p>
<p>With this in mind, ParlayBay is the perfect partner for us, and we’re excited to be the first operator going live with the company’s unique product. Justinas Slaizas, CEO, 7bet</p>
<p>7bet head of sportsbook Ignas Jurgelevicius also welcomed the opportunity.</p>
<p>ParlayBay and 7Bet previously launched products in Lithuania together in September. The latest collaboration is an extension of their successful partnership. ParlayBay also formed a content partnership with BlueOcean Gaming.</p>
