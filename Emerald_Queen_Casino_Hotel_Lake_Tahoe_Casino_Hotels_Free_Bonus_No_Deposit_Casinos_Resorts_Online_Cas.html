<p>British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC)’s PlayNow sports betting and iGaming brand has launched and is now available to Saskatchewan players. This is the third province where the brand has been able to launch. The rollout is the result of a partnership between SaskGaming and the Saskatchewan Indian Gaming Authority which has made the introduction of more interactive sports betting products available.</p>
<p>Launching BCLC’s Online Gaming Brand with Saskatchewan</p>
<p>There are more than 400 games to choose from in the casino sector already, and the PlayNow brand is planning to continue innovating its product offering, including live casino and poker products. PlayNow is likely to continue introducing these products over the next year.</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch BCLC president and CEO Pat Davis said that the launch was welcome and that it was an opportunity for the organization to bring more legal and online regulated gambling to Saskatchewan. All of this is in line with the organization’s commitment to social responsibility and generating strong financial results that translate into communal good. He added:</p>
<p>We would like to thank our partners at SIGA and SaskGaming for their collaboration in bringing our safe, secure and industry-leading PlayNow.com platform to the province of Saskatchewan. BCLC president and CEO Pat Davis</p>
<p>SIGA president and CEO Zane Hansen also welcomed the partnership and said that the organization was thrilled to be the exclusive provider for Saskatchewan’s first and only legal online gambling site. Thanks to this new roll-out, players in the province will be able to enjoy secure gambling options and visit their favorite casinos to play games, or even place bets on popular sports events.</p>
<p>SaskGaming president and CEO Susan Flett was happy with the opportunity and said that it was a historic day for casino gaming and entertainment in Saskatchewan. “PlayNow.com will change the gaming industry as we know it and I want to extend my appreciation to BCLC and SIGA for helping make this launch a reality,” Flett concluded.</p>
