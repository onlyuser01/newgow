    <h1>Aladdin Resort And Casino Las Vegas Ducky Luck Casino Free Chip Valley View Casino Hotel Tropicana C</h1>

<p>Thank you for your reply. First they told me that I needed more documents because they were unsure about the first for the kyc. I supplied a plethora and they couldn't say it wouldn't work. Next they said the bonus had a 40$ max out but there was a min out was 100$. I told them that I had my bonus total, which was all I had in my wallet over the 100$ min out. They then told me that I had to make a deposit first. They wouldn't let me withdraw unless it was a 60$ deposit, this wasn't ever in any of the text that I found anywhere, it had said a deposit was needed before a withdrawal but not how much. I was very Leary but eventually I deposited 65$ in litecoin, 5$ extra so they couldn't say that after the transfer that fees made it less than 60$. Deposited and played the 2X walkthrough off and then played it down until I had slightly over 100$. They then said I needed to provide documents for kyc check (again) at this point I'm figuring I lost the money because how absurd is this so far. I provide it. I wait about a month being told 3 more days every day I ask. I then get a denial because I was told that somewhere along the way I bet $7.50... I didn't, and they didn't provide any documentation that I did. So they took away the forty dollars bonus leaving me with 60, then as a free "bonus" they added 5$. I told them I didn't want it and to keep the fricken 40$ give me back my deposit. They said no because they could only cash out min 100$. Nothing they could do. Then nerfed my account so I couldn't win anything off the sixty inorder to get to the min cash out. And I know if I did they would say something about the 5$ bonus I didn't ask for. They are crooks. I still want my 60$ back.</p>
