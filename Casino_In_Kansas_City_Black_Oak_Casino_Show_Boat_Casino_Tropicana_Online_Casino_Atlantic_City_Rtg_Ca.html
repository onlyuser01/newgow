    <h1>Casino In Kansas City Black Oak Casino Show Boat Casino Tropicana Online Casino Atlantic City Rtg Ca</h1>

<p>The popular turnkey and casino platform developer will incorporate the aspiring casino software development company’s iconic titles using its unified application programming interface (API) system. The deal also includes the iconic Zeppelin game, one of Betsolutions’ greatest hits thanks to unique “crash” game mechanics and multiplayer features.</p>
<p>The New Deal Paves the Way for Additional Provably Fair Games</p>
<p>Other blockchain-powered games from Betsolutions have been this way given the green light to become available for similar integration with API. Provably fair is the algorithm that relies on technologies that enable online randomization for stepping up and reaching new levels of fairness and transparency.</p>
<p>It uses the perks of blockchain technology to complete randomization activities including the shuffling of card decks, coin flipping, or dice throwing. The process can be verified by all players engaged in a certain provably fair game.</p>
<p>Betsolutions’ co-founder Guram Rukhadze explained the new agreement would enable their games to reach “thousands of players across CIS, Asian and European markets”, which was the company’s current goal.</p>
<p>Looking to set the foundation for powerful connections on the market while building a name “that will echo for years to come”, Betsolutions found it necessary to associate with “the best gaming distributors”. SoftGamings was on the list, according to Rukhadze, hence their decision to come together.</p>
<p>At the end of 2022, SoftGamings, the company that describes itself as “the world’s most innovative developers of gaming platforms and supplier of robust, turnkey gaming systems” made it on the prestigious shortlist of nominees for the Platform Provider of the Year Award during the Global Gaming Awards. The event will be held on February 6 in London.</p>
<p>SoftGamings Aims to Keep Its Offer “Fresh”</p>
<p>The company’s director of partnerships Anna Lalina explained how important it is to continuously attract new game providers in an attempt to maintain it “fresh and appealing” for operators and players. Lalina further explained that the decision to sign with companies like Betsolutions was “a step in the right direction”. Its current roster of clients features more than 80 reputable casino brands known all over the planet.</p>
<p>To date, the company that has the “Build Your Own Casino” logo has worked on developing its own bonus, loyalty program, and dedicated tournament system. Last November, the company received regulatory approval from the gambling commission in Romania that would allow it to launch its casino and sports betting offerings in the country.</p>
