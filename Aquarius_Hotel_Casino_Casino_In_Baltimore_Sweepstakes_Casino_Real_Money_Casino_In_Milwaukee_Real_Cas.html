<p>The leading supplier of iGaming products, Wazdan, announced a new multi-brand partnership with the dynamic online iGaming operator, PressEnter Group. On Friday last week, Wazdan unveiled details regarding the partnership which will expand its reach across the MGA jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The collaboration will see PressEnter Group brands gain access to Wazdan's complete portfolio. Under the terms of the new deal, the supplier's leading products will be introduced for PressEnter Group brands that include JustSpin, NitroCasino, NeonCasino, RapidCasino, UltraCasino and award-winning 21.com.</p>
<p>The multi-brand deal will see highly-popular Wazdan hits such as Power of Gods: Medusa, Magic Spins as well as the recently released slot, SizzLing Eggs, become available for PressEnter's brands. What's more, the new agreement sees innovative features and mechanics, including volatility levels, collect to infinity and hold the jackpot, become available for PressEnter's brands.</p>
<p>In a press release dated May 10, 2022, PressEnter's Chief Product Officer, Hampus Eriksson, said: "Offering our players the most engaging and thrilling content is incredibly important to us and Wazdan's collection of slot titles, with their artful graphics, strong math models, and thrilling mechanics will be an excellent addition to our casino portfolio."</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Head of Business Development for Europe and North America at Wazdan, Bekki D'Agata, added: "We pride ourselves on partnering with exciting, innovative brands and PressEnter Group has made impressive strides since being founded in 2018." She pointed out that PressEnter aligns well with Wazdan. In conclusion, D'Agata said that the company is looking forward to the success the new collaboration will bring to PressEnter's brands.</p>
<p>Founded more than a decade ago, Wazdan is among the leading slot developers globally. The company has a portfolio of more than 140 fun games that combine innovation, technology and creativity to create new experiences.</p>
<p>Based in Malta, Wazdan currently holds licenses from the Malta Gaming Authority, the UK Gambling Commission, the Swedish Gambling Authority, Hellenic Gaming Commission, as well as the Romanian National Gambling Office. Currently, the company is certified and can offer its services in New Jersey in the US, Denmark, Spain, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Switzerland, Portugal, Columbia and more key global markets.</p>
<p>The recent deal between PressEnter and Wazdan complements the iGaming developer's ongoing global expansion. Early last month, Wazdan expanded its presence to Ontario, Canada. The company entered Canada's most populous province after receiving approval from the gambling regulator, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).This marked Wazdan's 20 regulated market entry.</p>
<p>Late in May, Wazdan was shortlisted for the SBC North America Awards in the category of Rising Star in Casino. The nomination for the prestigious award is a significant recognition for the innovative games provider.</p>
