<p>Microgaming Poker Network confirmed that it will shut down on May 19, 2020.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Microgaming announced that it would be shutting down its poker network at sometime in the future. Now, the exact closure date of the Microgaming Poker Network (MPN) has been confirmed May 19, 2020.</p>
<p>There was once a time when Microgaming was one of the biggest poker network on the web but, over the years, it was surpassed by other brands. Eventually, PokerStars and partypoker became the leaders in the online poker world.</p>
<p>Eventually Microgaming Poker Network players starting to make their way over to the bigger brands. So, it was only a matter of time before MPN started to lose a significant amount of business.</p>
<p>MPN will deal our last hand on May 19th, 2020.</p>
<p>Our MD @AlexScott72o: 'Let’s do everything we can to make the next six months something special, which we can look back on with pride.’#ChallengeAccepted — MPN (@ThrillOfPoker) November 25, 2019</p>
<p>The announcement of closure was originally made in September 2019. Executives at Microgaming had reviewed the software and decided that it would be best for the company if the network were to be shut down.</p>
<p>“The network model no longer fits with our strategic vision for poker, and this is the right time to announce the closure as we focus on redistributing key resources and personnel across the business,” read a statement from John Coleman, Microgaming’s CEO.</p>
<p>However, he also mentioned that this wouldn’t be the end of poker at Microgaming. There is no word on what poker plans Microgaming has in the future, but we do look forward to seeing what’s next.</p>
<p>What Does This Mean for MPN Poker Players?</p>
<p>If you’re a player on the Microgaming Poker Network, you don’t have to worry. According to MPN’s Managing Director, Alex Scott, migration will be an easy process and you’ll still have access to your money.</p>
<p>All of the sites that are on MPN will be finding new suppliers. So, there should be no downtime in between switching from one poker client to another.</p>
<p>These are the sites that will be changing online poker suppliers once MPN shuts down in May:</p>
<p>Grosvenor Poker</p>
<p>One Time Poker</p>
<p>OlyBet</p>
<p>Bets10</p>
<p>188Bet</p>
<p>NordicBet</p>
<p>PCF Poker</p>
<p>CoolBet</p>
<p>Paf</p>
<p>BetSafe</p>
<p>Betsson</p>
<p>32Red</p>
<p>So, if you’re a player on any of the above sites, you may notice that there will be some changes to your poker software as they migrate to new software.</p>
