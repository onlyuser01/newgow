<p>NuxGame, a developer of iGaming solutions, has signed a new partnership with Flows, a platform dedicated to assisting game studios in creating brand-new titles using familiar and innovative archetypes without the necessity to code the titles and products. Dubbed a "no-code innovation platform," Flows brings an interesting perspective to the game-development process and one that NuxGame can benefit from.</p>
<p>As a result, NuxGame partners will be able to leverage Flows’ unique proposition and develop new features and applications without the need for code. Flows is focused on making it easier for platform providers to enable third parties to develop creative products that do not necessarily require a solid coding background to make it happen.</p>
<p>NuxGame implements all its solutions into a partner’s offering by using its API technologies to deliver a range of experiences across both casino and sports betting. The new tie-up will further allow NuxGame customers to "supercharge their business model," the company says in an official press release.</p>
<p>The end goal is to ensure that operational costs are reduced, and development times cut, with key processes being automated safely and reliably. All of this brings brands closer to providing a first-class player experience that inspires loyalty and trust between business and consumer.</p>
<p>NuxGame CEO Daniel Heywood welcomed this opportunity and said that the company was excited to have the chance to make yet another improvement and addition to its proposition. "We are delighted to be able to give our customers greater choice," Heywood added. He hailed the fact that Flows’ offer came with zero coding requirements, making it more agile and accessible.</p>
<p>Director of Sales at Flows, Domenico Mazzola, was similarly happy to have teamed up NuxGame. He welcomed the fact that NuxGame had recognized the benefits and upsides of leveraging Flows and its portfolio of solutions. No-code automation can have a truly positive impact on NuxGame partners, Mazzola said.</p>
<p>"We look forward to building a long-term relationship with them and welcoming their customers to Flows in the not-too-distant future," he concluded. As to Flows, the platform itself is developed in an agile way that allows it to integrate seamlessly alongside any other coding solution.</p>
<p>Flows prides itself on being a no-code and plug-in platform that is easy to integrate into any company’s offering. Previously, Flows signed a partnership with Nazionale Elettronica.</p>
