    <h1>New Usa Online Casinos With No Deposit Bonuses The Casino Dania Beach Railroad Pass Hotel Casino Spi</h1>

<p>The last news from Riot Games was back in April with the announcement of a partnership with EU LCS. Today, they announced a record not only with their brand but for Twitch.</p>
<p>Twitch is an online site where people can post videos on various topics, such as eSports, poker, and more. Riot Games has been posting videos and commentary on Twitch for a long time and recently they hit a new record.</p>
<p>Riot Games is the first Twitch Channel to break one billion views.</p>
<p>League of Legends</p>
<p>Riot Games is the creator of League of Legends. The Twitch channel that shares League of Legends news and other eSports information has reached a new height that not every company has a chance of attaining—one billion views. Most companies and Twitchers may hope to reach a few hundred thousand, maybe even a million, so seeing one billion is worth noting.</p>
<p>The company managed to get the record-breaking views when they posted a live game between FlyQuest and OpTic Gaming. The game occurred on June 24, 2018. It is also the second day of a two week LCS Summer Split happening in North America.</p>
<p>Riot Games channel only broadcasts to European and North American regions. It shows matches for international competitions, such as the Mid-Season Invitational and the World Championship. They have also broadcast games from Korea’s LCK, which is broadcast on OnGameNet. Korean games may decide to come back to the Riot Games channel with Riot Korea if the LCK and the League Park get a new studio in Seoul.</p>
<p>If you decide to start following the channel, the oldest video you can start with is one broadcast on September 8, 2012. It was the most popular video in part two of the Season Two World Championship Finals that occurred between Azubu Frost and Taipei Assassins. The video managed to gain 657,130 views, a far sight from the 1 billion of Sunday’s broadcast.</p>
<p>The company feels it was a major achievement and is happy to have something good to report after a few years of heavy criticism that has occurred in the last couple of years. Several League forums and Reddit have questioned the game’s survivability, but as the first Twitch Channel to get one billion views—you might not be able to argue that bad press anymore.</p>
<p>Riot Games will broadcast LCS games in the future and will have the World Championship 2018 up later in the year.</p>
