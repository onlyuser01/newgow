<p>GGPoker is hosting the WSOP Winter Online Circuit Series which will see over $100 million in prize pools distributed across hundreds of events.</p>
<p>Over 18 Gold Ring Events in GGPoker $100m Poker Series</p>
<p>GGPoker is happy to announce yet another poker festival that will have poker fans excited, with the WSOP Winter Online Circuit Series coming in big, boasting the eye-popping $100 million in guaranteed prize pools, leading industry website Pokerfuse informs. There will be hundreds of events for poker aficionados to enjoy this holiday season, with the events getting underway from December 13 through January 10, 2021.</p>
<p>If poker is your thing, you will get the chance to experience a vastly competitive field, but also enjoy a few more recreational competitions. For those aiming big, GGPoker is offering 18 Gold Ring Events for the total prize pool of $30 million in guaranteed prizes divvied up between the events.</p>
<p>A $10M Main Event to Remember</p>
<p>With a new WSOP event confirmed, GGPoker is not missing out on the opportunity to host its own $10 million Main Event which will see the final table take place on January 16, a week after the regular scrimmages have come to a rewarding halt, at least for those who have made it through.</p>
<p>GGPoker has not spared any effort in setting-up the upcoming Main Event bout, calling it “the biggest $1K of all time,” and with the event featuring $1700 as the buy-in. The Main Event, which is a phased event, will get underway much earlier, on January 4 when Day 1 gets underway, Pokerfuse says. Phase 2 will kick on January 10.</p>
<p>Players looking for a slightly less demanding event can try the Mini-Main Event, which has a $170 buy-in. While the buy-in may look much lower, the prize pool isn’t, and there are $2 million up for the taking there as well.</p>
<p>Another big highlight here is the Big 50 which will have $1 million in guaranteed prize pool, but could grow further. There will be a WSOPC $100k Series Leaderboard as well, so ultimately, you will have a ton of different ways to enjoy yourself if you are a poker fan this holiday season, and especially so if GGPoker is available in your region.</p>
<p>Schedule to All 18 Gold Ring Events</p>
<p>Thanks to poker reporter Christian Zetzsche we have a screenshot of the full schedule for the 18 Gold Ring Events and GGPoket.TV’s broadcast schedule.</p>
<p>Many expected that another festival will be added along the @WSOP Main Event and a WSOPC has now been confirmed.</p>

<p>GGPoker Targeting Medium and High-Stake Players</p>
<p>The upcoming poker festival will be targeting mostly medium-to-high stake players with the buy-ins varying between $100 and $1000, Pokerfuse says in its report.</p>
<p>The festival’s ring events feature a ton of worthwhile options to experience, with the prize pool divvied up in amounts ranging from $500,000 to $2 million for most events excluding the WSOPC #18: $1,700 Main Event, $10M GTD.</p>
<p>While the entry-level may seem a little steep at the present moment, there is a solution for talented but cash-strapped poker players, with the Winter Circuit Series able to join a number of satellite events available for as little as $5 on GGPoker.</p>
