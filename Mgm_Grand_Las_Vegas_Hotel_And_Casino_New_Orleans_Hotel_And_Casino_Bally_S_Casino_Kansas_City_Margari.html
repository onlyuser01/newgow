<p>Hi, I can’t tell you with a 100% certainty when I registered because I can’t access my account, but it’s been almost a month ago.</p>
<p>A day before my account closure I successfully withdrew 1000€ EUR with no problems on this site. I had previously completed KYC verification but when I tried to withdraw my remaining balance, they blocked my account and sent me an e-mail - "Good Day. We are bringing to your notice that we made a decision to stop any collaboration with you (closing your gaming account) on the basis of General Terms and Conditions of the Bookmaker Company:</p>
<p>The bookmaker reserves the right to close a betting account immediately and void any bets placed thereon should the bookmaker establish that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when the bettor placed the bet, they had information on the result of the corresponding event;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bettor was able to influence the outcome due to their participation in the match (sportspeople, coaches, referees, etc.) or because they acted on behalf of participants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bets were placed by a group of bettors acting in concert (as a syndicate) in order to exceed the limits setby the bookmaker;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one bettor has a few betting accounts (multiple registration);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bettor is suspected of using special software or hardware facilitating automated betting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>unfair means were used to obtain information or circumvent restrictions imposed by the bookmaker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the aforementioned circumstances balances on customers’ accounts shall be refunded after an investigation has been concluded. The balance shall be calculated excluding any unfair profits generated. The bookmaker reserves the right not to reimburse the bettor for any service charges imposed by payment systems while depositing and/or withdrawing monies from the BETWINNER account.</p>
<p>The decision was made after rigorous investigation of the case by The Security Department.</p>
<p>We ask you not to create gaming accounts with The Company.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that your actions have been recognized as flagrant violation of The T&amp;Cs of our Company, the decision of stopping any cooperation with you was final and not subject to further appeal.</p>
<p>All further questions concerning the case of blocking from your side will be ignored."</p>
<p>I haven’t received any update from them about my remaining balance and when could I receive it.</p>
<p>And talking about games, I only bet sports games, mainly live games on top tournaments.</p>
