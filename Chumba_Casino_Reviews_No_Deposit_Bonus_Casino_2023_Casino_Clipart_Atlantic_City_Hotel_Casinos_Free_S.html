<p>Zombie Invasion Slot Review</p>
<p>Zombie Invasion slot game by Dragon Gaming is an excellent celebration of how far the studio can build its visual authenticity. The game delivers 30 fixed paylines across a five-by-three grid and accepts bets ranging from $0.30 to $90. Players stand to win a maximum amount of 1,000x of their original bet size and enjoy a medium-volatility slot with a 96% return-to-player rate.</p>
<p>There are loads of special saucy features in this one, making for exciting gameplay thanks to the Escape Infected City Game, Random Wild, and Free Spins, all of which are seamlessly baked into the core gameplay. Let’s dive into the game and explore it to its fullest. If you are eager to try the Zombie Invasion slot for free for yourself, refer to the demo above instead!</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Repel the Man-Eating Tides</p>
<p>Zombie Invasion by Dragon Gaming is set in the near future when some sort of biological catastrophe has turned the majority of the population into flesh-eating undead, or zombies if you will. The toxic spills or whatever calamity has befallen humanity has now left a handful of survivors scrambling to live on and hoping to get to safety – wherever safety may be!</p>
<p>Thematically, this game scores very high, as the grid tells the plot that may have a few blanks but makes for a very solid storyline altogether. As you spin the reels against a backdrop of zombies clamoring to tear down a fence, and probably eat you, you will come across many of the survivors, armed to the teeth, and ready to fight for dear life. Whether you hit the Butcher Symbol or the Pump Action Survivor, there are plenty of whimsically introduced symbols that are designed for your benefit.</p>
<p>The entire grid is an iron door with a barbed fence on top and the Zombie Invasion is stylized in grungy textures. The spin button is fittingly a red biohazard sign, as the zombie apocalypse in Dragon Gaming’s game has most likely been caused by a laboratory mistake that has gone wrong.</p>
<p>Zombie Invasion Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Right, so about those symbols… the game comes with both high and low-paying ones, which is nothing shocking. The lowest symbols are the letters A, K, Q, and J, and they pay from 5x to 100x for 3 and 5 respectively. You also get paid 25x for 4 symbols of a kind on a payline. There are six high-paying symbols that show various survivors who are determined to fight to their last breath.</p>
<p>In doing so, they may reward up to 500x for the Pump Action Survivor if you get 5 of those lined up on a payline. There is also a Wild Symbol that will help you complete paylines. The game also features a yellow toxic-container-like Scatter Symbol, and not least, an entire and very apt bonus game to enjoy.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Wow! Let’s just take a step back and appreciate the level of detail that has gone into designing the Zombie Invasion slot. Whether you play for free instant play or real money, Zombie Invasion is an engrossing game that will suck you in if you are a fan of the zombie franchise and the setting.</p>
<p>Dragon Gaming has spared no effort in building a game that is thematically sound and captivating, with the animated backdrop of zombies pressing against a fence and trying to get to you and the blood-stained low-paying symbols, and grime-covered survivors who are fighting tooth and nail to not become snack for a throng of enraged undead.</p>
<p>The audio only adds to the completionist effect of the theme, with the growls and rumbling of the zombies in the backdrop reminding you that there is an undead who is probably trying to eat your brain. Yum!</p>
<p>Zombie Invasion Gameplay</p>
<p>Zombie Invasion plays great on any device, owing to the HTML5 technology used in crafting it. Players will have an easy time navigating everything – from setting the table limits to using some of the extra features, including Dragon Gaming’s signature GAMBLE Feature that is pulsating in the bottom right corner – almost too invitingly.</p>
<p>You can also click on the “+” next to the Spin Button and choose from several options. For example, players can click on the Max Bet option, switch on Turbo, or set an Auto Spin. Players can further tinker with the sound themes and some of the visuals to adjust the game to their liking.</p>
<p>Zombie Invasion Slot Features: Free Spins, Random Wild, Escape Infected City</p>
<p>Zombie Invasion is meticulously crafted, and it features a bunch of awesome features that add to the fun you get from the game. Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<p>Free Spins: The free spins in Zombie Invasion are a huge part of the gameplay. They feature anything between 10, 15, or 20 free spin rounds.</p>
<p>Random Wild Feature: You can further enhance your Free Spins Feature with Random Wild which will appear during the bonus level and strengthen your chance to win.</p>
<p>Escape Infected City Game: The highlight of the slot is the Escape Infected City Game, which is triggered with the Runner Zombie, Policeman Zombie, and Waitress Zombie which land on reels 1, 3, and 5 respectively. During the bonus game, players will try to slay zombies, and for each one they do away with, they will get various perks – from multipliers to extra goodies and a progressive bonus level. If a zombie does get you, you will win the money from the last level and the game ends. Pretty sweet deals for dying during the zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Survive the Zombie Apocalypse the Mad Max Way</p>
<p>Zombie Invasion is one of the most vivid and rewarding slots there is. Painting a dark picture of the future, the slot makes up for its macabre setting with exciting gameplay features, and a bonus level that will keep you on your toes. You may win up to 1,000x of your bet size, benefit from various free spins and wild features, GAMBLE if you feel extra confident, and generally have fun slaying the zombie waves!</p>
