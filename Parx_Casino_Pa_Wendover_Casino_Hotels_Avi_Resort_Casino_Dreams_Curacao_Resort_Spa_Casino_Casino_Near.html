<p>The independent body established to safeguard the integrity of professional tennis, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), announced a new leadership change Wednesday. The Agency revealed it appointed Karen Moorhouse as its new CEO.</p>
<p>In her new position as CEO, Moorhouse fills in the spot which was left vacant back in September after Jonny Gray left the ITIA. A statement released by the organization on December 14, 2022, reveals that Moorhouse's appointment will be effective as of February 6, 2023.</p>
<p>Sharing her excitement, Moorhouse said: "I am absolutely delighted to be joining and already hugely impressed by the caliber of individuals I have met so far at the ITIA and across the sport, and their commitment to integrity."</p>
<p>She explained that the integrity of tennis is safe under the guidance of the ITIA. Moorhouse added that in her new position with the organization, she will continue the work with different sports governing bodies, stakeholders and other organizations.</p>
<p>At the same time, she pointed out that ensuring compliance and following the rules will be a main priority for the ITIA. Finally, Moorhouse said that her work and the Agency's work will be focused on "ensuring that Tennis remains a trusted sport attracting new players, commercial partners and fans."</p>
<p>Joining the ITIA, Moorhouse brings decades of experience within the sports vertical. She spearheaded the Rugby Football League in the UK as Chief Regulatory Officer, but her professional experience includes a non-executive director position on the Board at the Rugby League World Cup as well.</p>
<p>Jennie Price, ITIA's Chair of the Board, welcomed Moorhouse saying: "Karen stood out from a strong field of candidates as the person who combines the skills, experience and personal qualities to take integrity in tennis to the next level."</p>
<p>Price acknowledged that Moorhouse has deep knowledge of sports integrity and "brings impressive governance and commercial experience to the role." The ITIA's Chair of the Board pointed out that Moorhouse is a proven expert and a strong asset to the team. Last but not least, Price welcomed Moorhouse to the Agency.</p>
<p>The latest senior-level appointment follows a ban issued by ITIA recently. Earlier this month, the Agency announced it banned Bulgarian chair umpireStefan Milanov for six months. At the time of the announcement, the ITIA said that it uncovered the chair umpire placed bets on tennis which is why the sanction was imposed. Besides the six-month ban, the ITIA issued a fine of $10,000 (with $5,000 suspended).</p>
