<p>DraftKings will be opening up a new office in Las Vegas, which will employ over 200 employees.</p>
<p>Over 200 Employees to Start at DraftKings’ New Vegas Office</p>
<p>DraftKings has been experiencing tremendous growth across the United States and, to stay on its upward trajectory, the brand will be opening up a new office in Las Vegas. The company wants to be close to all of the talented gaming professionals that the city has to offer, which will further boost advancement in the American gambling market.</p>
<p>Over 200 employees will be working at the new office. This is a huge step forward for DraftKings, as the company’s original Las Vegas office that was opened in 2018 only had about a dozen workers.</p>
<p>“This is an iconic city when it comes to sports betting. It’s been the hub of all of that activity in our country for many decades. We see ourselves as looking to integrate as deeply as possible into the community.”</p>
<p>One of the first people to come on board in Las Vegas was Johnny Avello, who formerly worked as the sportsbook director at Wynn Las Vegas. He was hired in 2018 to work in the same position at DraftKings, and the brand will be looking to hire similarly experienced employees for its new location.</p>
<p>The reason that the company wants to get further into the world of Las Vegas, as it is the world’s gaming hub. Since it is home to some of the biggest casinos in the world, Vegas offers a talented workforce that can help DraftKings offer players a better gaming experience on the platform.</p>
<p>At the Las Vegas office, there will be a call centre that deals with all aspects of the customer experience. Staff in the centre will be able to handle inquiries all day, making for convenient service that will benefit customers.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ USA Expansion</p>
<p>Since DraftKings was established in 2012, the company has seen impressive growth. Within the course of the next three years, it became the official daily fantasy sports service of the NHL and the MLB. Then, it wasn’t long before the company started further expansion in the United States.</p>
<p>In 2018, DraftKings launched its first licensed online sportsbook in New Jersey. Since then, the brand has launched sportsbetting services in New York, West Virginia, Indiana, Mississippi, Iowa and Indiana.</p>
<p>As more and more states start putting together the framework to offer sportsbetting services, DraftKings is in an ideal position. It is certainly a leading gaming operator in the United States, and its new offices will allow for further development with staff based in the country’s gambling capital.</p>
