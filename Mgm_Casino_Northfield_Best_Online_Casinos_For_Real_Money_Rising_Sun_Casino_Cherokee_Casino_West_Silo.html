    <h1>Mgm Casino Northfield Best Online Casinos For Real Money Rising Sun Casino Cherokee Casino West Silo</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have an issue with the hugely exaggerated fees applied by the B-bets casino to my withdrawal.</p>
<p>I played at the casino more than 1 year ago. I won 2750 euro. It took several months to verify my accounts but I finally did it. Then it took another 2 months to get paid since the casino has decided to pay me in 3 installments and was always late to pay in time.</p>
<p>After the last payments it turned out that the casino has only paid me 2475 euro and the rest 275 euro was charged as a "Skrill payment fee".</p>
<p>Now, I play at online casinos for many years. In 99% of cases Skrill payments are absolutely free. In the other 1% - the casino might charge you but not more than 1%. It is ridiculous to charge a player 275 euro for sending him his winnings by Skrill.</p>
<p>I requested the casino to pay me in full. The reply was that they have sent me the amount in full but "the third party payment processor" has charged 11% for himself. This is a clear lie. The payments I received from the casino to my Skrill were all done by Condor Malta Ltd (as shown on my Skrill statement), which is the name of company owning B-bets casino. And there was not any third party involved in the transactions.</p>
<p>Please help me to get my winnings in full.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
