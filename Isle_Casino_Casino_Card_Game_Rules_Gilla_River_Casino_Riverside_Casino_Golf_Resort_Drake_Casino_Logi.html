<p>The Spurs are Ready for a Good Season</p>
<p>All signs are there that this is going to be a good season for Tottenham Hotspur. First of all, the Spurs have a fantastic head coach. Antonio Conte is the man in question, who led them to the Top 4 finish in his first season in charge of the team. By doing that, the Spurs booked themselves a place in the Champions League after a two-season break.</p>
<p>Conte did it while having a pretty decent roster at his disposal. This season, however, the Spurs are going to be way stronger than before. While keeping the core of the team intact, the club brought in several big-name players, most notably:</p>
<p>Richarlison (from Everton)</p>
<p>Clement Lenglet (from Barcelona)</p>
<p>Ivan Perisic (from Inter)</p>
<p>Yves Bissouma (from Brighton)</p>
<p>With such a strong squad, Conte’s team looks destined for good things in the 2022-23 season. And good things should start coming their way straight away – they should do very well in Round 1 of the Premier League.</p>
<p>It’s not just because the Spurs look phenomenal, it’s also because Southampton’s players do not.</p>
<p>Are We Going to See the Saints Struggle in 2022-23?</p>
<p>The Saints roster looks almost exactly the same as the last season, with a few notable exceptions. Armando Broja, for instance, who was one of their key forwards, has returned to his club Chelsea after a season-long loan spell.</p>
<p>All the other key players from the 2021-22 season are still in the squad, but the Saints haven’t made any major additions during the summer transfer period. Knowing all this, it’s only logical to assume they’re not going to do much differently than the last time. As a reminder, Southampton finished 15th in the previous season.</p>
<p>They did do great against Tottenham last season, beating the Spurs in North London and drawing at Saint Mary’s Stadium. This time, however, it should be a whole different story.</p>
<p>Tottenham vs Southampton Prediction</p>
<p>Bookmakers see the Spurs as the favorites in Saturday’s game and it’s for a reason. They are a much better bunch than Southampton, plus, they play on their turf this weekend. The only scenario we see in this game is a comfortable win for Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
<p>Picks: Tottenham to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
