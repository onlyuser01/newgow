    <h1>Island View Casino Gulfport Mississippi Casino Restaurants Near Me Fitzgeralds Casino Casino Deposit</h1>

<p>Good Day</p>
<p>I attempted to make a withdrawal prior to making the deposit, however it was declined due to reason being "deposit required before withdrawal".</p>
<p>I received an email from the casino stating that I need to make a deposit before I can proceed with my withdrawal. I have told them that I have already made the verification deposit a few weeks back and have already completed 1 successful withdrawal, however they insisted that I should make another deposit before I can proceed with the payout which I</p>
<p>have done. I spoke to more than one consultant who gave me the same instructions so at this point I simply followed the instructions that was given to me.</p>
<p>A few hours later I received an email stating my withdrawal has been declined reason being "mixing deposit with free spins" and that this is forbidden which means I violated the terms and condition. I fail to understand why the casino can say I'm</p>
<p>"mixing deposit with free spins" as they clearly instructed me to make the deposit. I did not deposit out of my own, therefore it was not my mistake but the casino itself for providing me with false information as I simply followed their instructions. My winnings were voided and I was left with my initial deposit which is very unfair as this was not my mistake, therefore I am entitled to receive the withdrawal and I cannot take responsibility for a mistake that I did not make.</p>
<p>Please find attached proof of the above matter.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
