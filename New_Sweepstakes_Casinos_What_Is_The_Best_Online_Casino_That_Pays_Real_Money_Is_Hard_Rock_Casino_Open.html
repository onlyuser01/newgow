    <h1>New Sweepstakes Casinos What Is The Best Online Casino That Pays Real Money Is Hard Rock Casino Open</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming has teamed up with Peter &amp; Sons, a supplier and developer of iGaming products, with the latter now becoming a member of the company’s Silver Bullet platform. Relax Gaming is a content provider for the industry, producing games in-house but also using its powerful aggregation iGaming platform to deliver products from other developers to business clients.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons Finds New Way to Players</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons was established in 2019 and has quickly gained prominence in the sector, making it possible for the studio to position itself better with other partners with a strong presence in the iGaming sector. The latest collaboration attests to both firm’s product and portfolio.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons will gain access to a number of tier-one operators through the Silver Bullet partnership which will enable the developer to rapidly expand its potential audience and introduce its games to new players. Peter &amp; Sons is just the latest to join Relax Gaming in recent months, with GAN, Four Leaf Gaming and Blue Guru all making a move in the sector.</p>
<p>Commenting on this accomplishment, Relax Gaming CEO Simon Hammon said that Peter &amp; Sons’ reputation in the vertical was beyond question. It’s one of the most well-respected studios and it’s a great honor to see their games added to Relax’s constantly-growing platform offering as well.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons business development manager and co-founder Yann Bautista Wiberg said that the team was similarly-pleased to be part of the Silver Bullet program. Wiberg added that the studio’s games have a huge hit with players so far and any new opportunity to prove that with fresh audiences is precisely what Peter &amp; Sons is after.</p>
<p>Delivering Content for the Entire Industry</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is a leading aggregator of iGaming content in the industry. The company features more than 4,000 online casinos brought by a motley bunch of providers keen to pool their efforts in a bid to reach the most audiences possible. Aggregators are changing the game for many small studios that can compete neck-and-neck with more established competitors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Relax Gaming has done some in-house reshufflement with Hammon stepping in as the new chief executive earlier in July. The company also added Apparat Gaming to its list of available suppliers to share with the wider iGaming industry in June.</p>
