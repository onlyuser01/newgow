<p>TopGolf and BetMGM are banding together to bring a more authentic experience at TopGolf’s recreational venues, tapping into augmented reality, and other loyalty benefits.</p>
<p>TopGolf Parks BetMGM Experience at Driving Ranges</p>
<p>BetMGM and TopGolf are teaming up to bolster their brand identities and boost awareness about sports betting, with driving ranges the targets of this partnership. The companies struck a multi-year partnership that will now benefit TopGolf locations in states where BetMGM holds a license to extend sports betting products.</p>
<p>This means that BetMGM’s brand and logo will appear at driving ranges in Detroit, Denver, Nashville, and not least Las Vegas. Arriving at driving ranges allows BetMGM the opportunity to try and target audiences who are more likely to place a wager, but necessarily actively doing so.</p>
<p>Explaining the company’s strategy, BetMGM head of partnerships Kyle Wachtel argued that such micro-deals were important. “You don’t only need those flashy media partnerships, whether it be CBS, ESPN, or others,” Wachtel said.</p>
<p>He argued that there are other targeted approaches and that a lot could be achieved if working together with different brands. BetMGM will expand its branding partnership by rolling out the M life Rewards, a loyalty program available to sports bettors and MGM Resorts International guests.</p>
<p>Augmented Reality and Beyond</p>
<p>The loyalty program may grant TopGolf credits for completing particular objectives on the BetMGM app, the company says. To up the ante, TopGolf and BetMGM will get their hands on augmented reality games, offering a new experience for visitors. Entain, one of BetMGM’s parent companies, has already signed a partnership with Verizon for virtual reality and augmented reality technology in sport betting.</p>
<p>TopGolf is a good entry point for BetMGM with golf fans, too, as TopGolf’s track record is more focused on leisurely players and entertainment rather than hardcore golfers. Originally, TopGolf started as an entirely golf-oriented organization, but these days it builds recreational venues that feature restaurants, arcades, mini-golf courses, and even music venues, bringing a new level of experience.</p>
<p>BetMGM is in no hurry to expand at every state TopGolf operates, but that would happen eventually as sport betting becomes legally available. Wachtel said his company understood the fragmented nature of the market, but it was equally important to scale up as soon as it became possible.</p>
<p>TopGolf is also well-acquainted with MGM Resorts, as its Las Vegas location is at the MGM Grand. The company also offers swing suites across other MGM properties, and not least the MGM Grand Detroit. Wachtel says his company doesn’t plan to introduce official sportsbooks at TopGolf venues, though.</p>
<p>BetMGM has been signing up numerous deals all over the country to bolster its presence through targeted partnerships. The company teamed up with former NFL player Barry Sanders to boost its portfolio in Michigan.</p>
<p>In January, the brand broke into Virginia’s newly-regulated sports betting market and the company already has numerous outstanding partnerships with sports franchises as the Washington Nationals, Philadelphia 76ers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Detroit Red Wings, and many others.</p>
