<p>BetMGM is branching out from sports betting and iGaming through a new app dedicated to horse racing in Ohio. The app will be gradually rolled out in other markets where horse racing is legal in the US, with BetMGM confident that it can enter a new vertical and continue to exercise market dominance as it has in sports betting.</p>
<p>The app is now available to download for both iOS and Android devices in the Buckeye State, making for easy access to a number of thoroughbred, harness, and quarter horse events at over 200 tracks around the world.</p>
<p>Covering Flagship Horse Racing Events All Over the World</p>
<p>BetMGM’s offer will feature flagship events such as the Grand National, Melbourne Cup, Triple Crown, and other noteworthy events from the world of horse racing. The app similarly covers the Saudi Cup and Dubai World Cup, Belmont Stakes, Breeders’ Cup, the Royal Ascot, and more events from the horse racing circuit that elicit the strongest betting action.</p>
<p>To deliver on a solid product, BetMGM is tapping NYRA Bets, the platform used by the New York Racing Association Inc (NYRA) to deliver racing content to stakeholders in the United States. As a result, consumers in Ohio will have the opportunity to place remote wagers using the BetMGM solution as long as they are within the state’s borders.</p>
<p>BetMGM, which has been focusing on expanding its footprint in the regulated sports betting market, is now making a leap forward in a new vertical, which is a natural continuation of its overall business model.</p>
<p>Company CEO Adam Greenblatt said that BetMGM was excited to be introducing a dedicated mobile experience for horse racing fans in Ohio and added:</p>
<p>“In partnership with NYRA Bets, we’ve created an innovative digital experience for horse racing fans and anticipate the platform’s future launch in additional states.” BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt</p>
<p>MGM Northfield Park SVP of marketing and operations Matt Buckley, whose facility is partnering with the launch, said that the land-based racetrack was excited to be helping the BetMGM brand bring more actionable betting options to Ohio and was a sign of Northfield Park’s own commitment to advancing horse racing in the state and beyond.</p>
