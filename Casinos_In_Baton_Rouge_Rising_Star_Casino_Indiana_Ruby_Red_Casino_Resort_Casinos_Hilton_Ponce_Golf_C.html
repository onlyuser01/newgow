<p>The provider of infrastructure and security solutions of the iGaming industry has expanded with a new office in India, ensuring that it’s prepared to service more partners</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies specializes in the provision of managed hosting, connectivity, cloud, and security services that help some of the world’s best online gambling brands to continue running their businesses.</p>
<p>New Office in India to Strengthen Operations</p>
<p>The expansion with an office in India will actually strengthen the company’s ability to recruit talent, but also anticipate future expansions in the region, giving it a firmer foothold locally. Continent 8 Technologies presently covers more than 95 locations on four continents and it is aiming at 100 by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies has put a strong emphasis on this new opportunity as it allows the company to scale up its services, understand local needs, and continue to position itself as a reliable and trusted partner. Company CCO Brian B. Koh said:</p>
<p>We are a truly global company so it’s important that we have a presence in all corners of the world to help deploy our long-term plans and support the wider organization and its commitment to being the number one infrastructure and security provider to the online gambling industry and businesses in other highly regulated sectors. Company CCO Brian B. Koh</p>
<p>Another executive to speak highly of the recent success is the company’s CEO and founder, Michael Tobin, who confirmed that Continent 8 is ambitious about its geographical growth and expansion and that it is constantly on the lookout to secure new expansion locations.</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies Builds Up Its Global Presence</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies now has 225 people working for the company around the globe. Continent 8 has been particularly well-represented in the North American region, where the company has focused on the United States.</p>
<p>There have been several market entries over the past months with Continent 8 obtaining licensure to join and launch in Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Ohio. The United States has experienced a rapid re-regulation of its iGaming and sports betting industries, which have been growing steadily.</p>
