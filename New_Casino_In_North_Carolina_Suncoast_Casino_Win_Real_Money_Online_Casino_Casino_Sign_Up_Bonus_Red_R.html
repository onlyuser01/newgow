    <h1>New Casino In North Carolina Suncoast Casino Win Real Money Online Casino Casino Sign Up Bonus Red R</h1>

<p>Fantasma Games, a Stockholm-based slots studio, has forayed into the US market with BetMGM thanks to an agreement with Light and Wonder.</p>
<p>The Swedish Developer Entered the US Market</p>
<p>Fantasma Games’ titles will be available in the United States for the first time. The Swedish developer will launch its titles on BetMGM’s casino platform in Michigan and West Virginia. Fantasma’s games will become available through OpenGaming, the content aggregation platform of Light and Wonder, its distribution partner.</p>
<p>The first Fantasma titles which to hit the US market are Wins of Nautilus Megaways and Bounty Showdown. The two became available in West Virginia on May 5 and will launch in Michigan in three days. Depending on their performance, more Fantasma games will come to BetMGM’s casino offerings in the US.</p>
<p>As Wings of Nautilus Megaways’ name suggests, it draws inspiration from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne, one of the pioneers in the science fiction genre. The title’s unique underwater atmosphere has established it as one of Fantasma’s best games. Bounty Showdown, on the other hand, follows a classic Wild West narrative and helps players relive the emotion of old cowboy movies.</p>
<p>Everyone Involved Expects Fantasma to Be Successful</p>
<p>Fredrik Johansson, Fantasma Games’ founder and chief executive officer, is excited by the US launch. He called this a key moment for the company. According to the CEO, this is something his team worked towards for the past three years. To Johansson, the launch in the US is proof that Fantasma’s games are good enough for the competitive US market.</p>
<p>Speaking about the games, Johansson said that Fantasma’s core strategy is to go beyond gambling and engage players with exciting and atmospheric titles. He hopes that BetMGM’s players will enjoy them as much as bettors in Europe.</p>
<p>Steve Mayes, Light and Wonder’s director of partnerships, praised Fantasma Games’ team for its creativity and vision. He said that players of other OpenGaming partners have already experienced the thrill of Fantasma first-hand and have grown to love the developer. Mayes expects punters in West Virginia and Michigan to love the two new games.</p>
<p>Oliver Bartlett, BetMGM’s director of gaming, also spoke about the launch. He emphasized that BetMGM is constantly seeking to add new premium titles to its diverse portfolio. Bartlett added that he is excited to add Fantasma Games’ thematic titles to the company’s offerings.</p>
