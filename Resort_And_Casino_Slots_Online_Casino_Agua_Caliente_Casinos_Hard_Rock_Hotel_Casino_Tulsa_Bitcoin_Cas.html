<p>Splash Tech has introduced a new game it is confident will help operators create retention and attract new users. Sports Lotto is a free-to-play (FTP) game that can be used by casinos, sportsbooks and more, offering a versatile gaming solution with a dedicated target.</p>
<p>Splash Tech On the Edge of Innovation</p>
<p>Sports Lotto is a fully integrated web application that can be customized to any casino, sportsbook, or media site to help build the brand and retain customers. It is delivered using a low-code Software Development Kit (SDK), which allows for rapid customization and speed to market. The web app’s content can be customized to any sport and any league and can support any language.</p>
<p>Sports Lotto has a lottery-style component that rewards users who make imperfect or perfect predictions, depending on the configuration. The prizes can be customized from $1 to $100 million, with free bets, free spins, and tangible rewards offered.</p>
<p>Splash Tech’s expanding team works with providers around the globe, adapting and integrating Sports Lotto for customers’ business requirements as part of its fully managed service. The company’s games increase engagement by asking questions that are quiz-like. This appeals to sports fans and gets gamers to really get involved.</p>
<p>Splash Tech Makes a Splash in the FTP Segment</p>
<p>Splash Tech creates market-leading, highly engaging, FTP daily retention games. These help brands like MaximBet, MLB, Betcris, and 888, which are already partnered with the company, grow their brands, show their customer experiences, and attract new customers. The company holds vendor licenses in several US states, as well as in Latin America, Europe, and Africa.</p>
<p>Splash Tech just announced Ross Main as its new sales director. He has held previous senior sales positions at SBC and Kambi.</p>
<p>Ross said of his new appointment, “I am delighted to be joining Splash Tech now. Customer Engagement is an increasingly difficult challenge in the industry. Operators are constantly looking to find new ways to engage, acquire and retain their customers across highly competitive Casino, Sports Betting, and iGaming markets. Splash is the premium FTP games provider for operators across the world and I can’t wait to show my network and beyond this flexible and scalable world-class technology.”</p>
