    <h1>Presque Isle Downs And Casino Funzpoints Casino App Miami Casino Login Gala Casino Casino World Onli</h1>

<p>Table Trac has expanded its C-level lineup with the addition of Thomas Florio who will now head the company’s business development in specific regions</p>
<p>Florio is a well-seasoned industry veteran himself with a proven track record who will now be at the helm of the company’s expansion in the Eastern US and new territories.</p>
<p>Tapping a Well-Seasoned Industry Veteran</p>
<p>He has worked in the industry for more than 35 years and has extensive experience in casino operations and manufacturing which makes him an ideal pick for Table Trac, a company that has specialized in the development of casino management systems.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Florio said that he was very happy to see this opportunity unfold and for him to actually help steer one of the biggest companies in this particular vertical:</p>
<p>I am eager to hit the ground running and assist the team in getting to the next level. Thomas Florio, business development head, Table Trac</p>
<p>Florio’s relevant experience spans companies such as Wynn Resorts, Penn, and various tribal casinos both in the United States and Canada. He has worked with Caesars Entertainment and has been an executive in gaming manufacturing, holding positions with AGS, TCS-John Huxley, Aristocrat, and many others. His appointment was similarly hailed by Table Trac Inc president Chad Hoehne who said:</p>
<p>Gaining the benefit of Mr Florio’s experience and industry knowledge has an immediate impact on CasinoTrac’s expansion plan. I am pleased to welcome Tommy to Table Trac. Table Trac Inc president Chad Hoehne</p>
<p>Growth Becomes Core Focus for Table Trac</p>
<p>This latest appointment tracks with the company’s overall expansion efforts that have seen other high-ranking industry executives join. Table Trac recently added Jeff Baldi who has become the company’s SVP of commercial strategy, a further testimony to the company’s switch into a higher gear.</p>
<p>Table Trac has been growing its presence in the United States and Canada, as well as globally, with the company planning on more expansion moves over the coming months. One recent success was achieved in Mississippi where the company obtained a license to install its gaming management equipment across the state.</p>
