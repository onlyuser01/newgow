<p>22,000 Malaysians Arrested for Illegal Gambling in 2018 in Predominantly Muslim Country</p>

<p>Malaysian police have announced 22,000 arrests across more than 10,000 raids of illegal gambling operations in just the past eight months.</p>

<p>Inspector General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun released the figures this week. Gambling is strictly forbidden in Islam, the primary religion of the country.</p>
<p>Malaysia — which is more than 60 percent Muslim in population and whose official religion is Islam — also has strict laws against such activity, except for the national lottery and one opulent casino, Resorts World Genting.</p>
<p>Fuzi says that 2018 has seen 22,300 people arrested over the course of 12,449 raids. The sweeps were conducted on illicit gambling dens and lottery syndicates.</p>
<p>“These numbers show a decrease compared to 12,628 raids and 24,338 arrests last year,” Fuzi said in a statement.</p>
<p>Despite fewer raids, cash seizures increased from RM 3.73 million ($USD 900,000) in 2017 to RM 4.67 million ($USD 1.13 million) in 2018, with $350,000 of that coming from illegal lottery schemes alone. In addition to the cash, police seized 25,267 mobile devices, tablets, and computers linked to illegal activity.</p>
<p>Tipping the Scales</p>
<p>A flood of tipsters have played a big role in helping police pin down where the illicit activity is taking place.</p>
<p>Since installing a dedicated hotline in every region, authorities have received 716 tips: of those, 161 turned out to be false, but another 414 of them led to successful raids.</p>
<p>Those tips have also helped them to concentrate their raids on specific regions. Police point to the Johor territory on the southern tip of the peninsula — as well as the region surrounding the capital of Kuala Lumpur — as the areas with the highest concentration of gambling activity.</p>
<p>No Breaks for Bad Cops</p>
<p>Fuzi also had a warning for Malaysian police who think their law enforcement status might allow them to fly under the radar.</p>
<p>“Stern action will be taken against any officer, including OCPDs (Officer in Charge of Police Districts) and state police chiefs who do not dispense their duties effectively,” he said.</p>
<p>Last year, Malaysian authorities said that they wouldn’t be able to make significant inroads into illegal gambling activity without first doing something about all the corruption within police ranks.</p>
<p>According to a story in the Straits Times, Fuzi himself is set to be fired in an effort to clean up police ranks from the top down. The report indicated that Fuzi — who was appointed by the former premier last year — would be replaced in what was described by sources as “an 8.5 Richter shake-up.”</p>
<p>The source indicated that Fuzi would be out by July, but with the chief still leading the wave of gambling raids, that has yet to happen.</p>
