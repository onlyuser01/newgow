    <h1>Treasure Island Casino Minnesota Casino Near Me With Slot Machines Walker S Bluff Casino Resort L Au</h1>

<p>So I'm asking for a phone bill so I can withdraw even though I withdraw before and I told him that my phone is prepaid so I have no phone bill and I proceeded to give them my phone payment history and they said that that's not enough that's not what they're looking for and they're not exactly telling me what they're looking for and I have to go through customer service just to get in contact with the compliance team and the compliance team is not contacting me back and I asked to talk to the manager they're not telling me anything they're just saying that I have to talk to the compliance team even though the confines team is not getting back to me and I did give him a PDF of a phone of my phone inquiry of like of me payment and then I also gave them a screenshot of my phone payment and it also proceeded to tell them that it's prepaid and I don't get a bill and they're saying that's the only thing I can give them which is ridiculous because I already completed the verification process the identity of process of that verification and they already paid me out first time first time was 150 and now that is 890 they don't want to pay me out even though I paid in Bitcoin and I did not pay in Visa which is a know your own the kyc so I don't understand what the issue is and nobody's telling me what the issue is they're just keep on having me go through a loop to talk to nobody basically and they're not talking to me telling me what can I use for alternatives.
