<p>ESA Gaming has just added a new country to its growing list of operating jurisdictions. After receiving a license to offer its products and services in Romania, ESA Gaming announced that it will expand into the country’s online gaming market.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming Lands in Romania</p>
<p>Romanian online casino operators are now able to make partnership agreements with the software provider and its EasySwipe line of products. EasySwipe is rapidly gaining popularity in the industry and is found in several countries already.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming’s innovative game suite EasySwipe features lightweight titles that are mobile-first and are developed in HTML5 using a mobile-first approach. Operators will be able to benefit from a variety of features designed to increase customer retention and revenue. This includes the ability for bettors to “swipe into and swipe out” of high-quality games that do not interfere with their current betting activity.</p>
<p>Joker Poker and Egyptian Reels are two of the top-quality games available for integration under this new license.</p>
<p>Romania, with its substantial size, has almost 30 licensed online gambling operators. The market is expanding rapidly and the potential for legal gambling in real money casinos is enormous, with a population close to 20 million.</p>
<p>This license marks a major milestone in the history of the software provider. Romania joins ESA’s active list that includes Colombia, Italy, and Portugal. It also holds supplier licenses in Malta and Greece.</p>
<p>Romania a Hotbed of Activity</p>
<p>There have been a number of additions to Romania’s iGaming market in recent months. GGPoker and Gaming Realms launched in the country last November. They were followed by Push Gaming and the addition of Red Tiger to Superbet in December.</p>
<p>Last October, Enteractive partnered with Fortuna Entertainment, an elite Central European betting company. The customer retention specialist oversees the company’s player reactivation campaigns.</p>
<p>Romania is home to a variety of operators within the gaming industry. SuperBet is one of the most productive. Statista reports that the company earned $135.72 million in revenue in 2019. Due to COVID-19, this figure fell to $128.88 million in 2020. However, 2021 brought a new wave of activity, and further growth is expected this year.</p>
