<p>The innovative crypto casino asked its fans to stay informed and told them that its re-licensing is a completely standard procedure</p>
<p>Rollbit, an online operator that claims to be “crypto’s most innovative casino,” addressed its community’s concerns regarding its license status. The company vowed to continue maintaining transparency regarding the matter.</p>
<p>Rollbit noted that its license is currently in its annual renewal period. The company pointed out that this is a completely standard procedure for all Curaçao-based platforms.</p>
<p>The company added that it is maintaining active communication with its licensor about the renewal. Rollbit also told its users that it will provide more news as soon as possible. While regulatory affairs tend to be an internal process, the company promised to keep its fans updated.</p>
<p>Since Rollbit’s inception, we’ve undergone the same renewal process each year, which ensures that we maintain the standards expected of a licensed casino. Rollbit statement</p>
<p>As promised, the company did share an update later, saying that its licensor had suggested some changes related to its NFT and crypto offering.</p>
<p>This Is Not an Anomaly</p>
<p>The company also addressed its NFT and Crypto Futures products. It noted that these have never been covered by its casino license. However, Rollbit reminded readers that this has always been the case and that this has always been noted in its site’s footer.</p>
<p>Despite that, the team has not received anything that would suggest that its business is problematic. Rollbit reassured fans that its diligent legal team is always working hard to ensure the legitimacy of its activities.</p>
<p>Rollbit furthermore added that this is not the first time concerns have been raised during a renewal period. The company said that the gaming and crypto industries can benefit a lot from constructive criticism. However, Rollbit advised users to do more research before voicing their concerns.</p>
<p>Rollbit also said that it has implemented minor UI changes based on its licensor’s recommendations. However, nothing else has changed, the company emphasized. It noted that its operations continue to run smoothly, “with fully covered balances and no issues with deposits or withdrawals.”</p>
<p>Rollbit concluded:</p>
<p>Our team continues to build. We can’t wait to share what we’ve been working on. Rollbit statement</p>
<p>Rollbit’s statement comes in the wake of customer concerns that saw many traders sell the platform’s RLB token. This reactionary approach caused RLB trading prices to sharply decline.</p>
<p>According to data from CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, a single RLB equals $0.015 USD as of the time of this writing.</p>
<p>The price of RLB tokens has been declining since mid-March when the tokens’ price fluctuated between 0.32 and 0.39.</p>
