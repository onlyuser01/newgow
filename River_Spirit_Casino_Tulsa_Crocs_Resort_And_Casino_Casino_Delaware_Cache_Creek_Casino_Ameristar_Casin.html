    <h1>River Spirit Casino Tulsa Crocs Resort And Casino Casino Delaware Cache Creek Casino Ameristar Casin</h1>

<p>Dear ptujpettau,</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this issue into our attention.</p>
<p>You are indeed correct about your interpretation of the T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p>Rule 9.3 was presented in our T&amp;Cs on some localizations, due to a technical faulty, and is now in the process of being removed. Of course, we are obliged to respect our T&amp;Cs and will comply with this rule for the affected users, until the T&amp;Cs are updated.</p>
<p>As Kristina described, Rollino is a licensed casino and as such, we are required to enforce mandatory deposit wagering requirements, without the option to withdraw with 2% fee before wagering is completed.</p>
<p>We hereby advice you to take into consideration that withdrawing funds before wagering is completed won't be possible after the T&amp;Cs are updated, in case you plan to deposit again in the future.</p>
<p>Looking into your account, we can see that you've already managed to complete the wagering requirement , and even win more then the disputed amount of €807. We would like to congratulate you for that !</p>
<p>As of 28/11/23 15:18 UTC, your account balance is €0.04, and you have 2 pending withdrawal requests in the total amount of €1,052 -</p>
<p>492 EUR via bank transfer (noda) - set to be executed on 29/11/23 560 EUR via Skrill - set to be executed on 29/11/23</p>
<p>Our financial department will send you email notifications tomorrow once the withdrawals have been executed.</p>
<p>You are welcome to update here once the withdrawals have been received and this dispute can be marked as resolved.</p>
<p>Moving forward , we'd like to wish you only positive experiences playing at Rollino Casino.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Rollino Team</p>
