<p>The leading American resort company, Westgate Resorts, unveiled a new initiative ahead of this year’s Veterans Day.</p>
<p>US Military Have a Chance to Win a Complimentary Vacation</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the company announced a new initiative honoring active-duty US military members, Gold Star families and veterans. The new initiative will seek to award those members with a free three-day, two-night vacation. Starting from November 11, 2022, at 9 AM, the first 1,000 eligible military personnel that sign up via the company’s mobile app, Westgate Resorts Mobile App, will be able to enjoy a complimentary weekend vacation. The vacation applies to up to four guests at the Studio Villa at Westgate Vacation Villas and Town Center Resort between December 9 and December 11, 2022.</p>
<p>Military members that are interested in participating in the initiative will need to download Westgate’s mobile app and sign up with the company’s World of Westgate Loyalty account for free. It’s important to mention that military members that want to participate in the initiative need to use a World of Westgate Members account to gain access to the complimentary stay form; the company explained that this process can only be completed via the Westgate Resorts Mobile App.</p>
<p>Combat veterans will need to provide a valid DD214 form, while active military members will need to submit a Military ID to complete their reservation. The latest initiative marks the 11th year Westgate awards complimentary vacations for military personnel. To date, the operator has given away more than 26,000 complimentary vacations via those unique initiatives.</p>
<p>The Vacation Will Offer Plenty of Unique Experiences</p>
<p>Participants in the initiative will experience different family-fun activities such as military vehicle demonstrations as well as the annual 5K run. There will be live entertainment as well as other activations that will deliver unique experiences for the guests. What’s more, the servicemen and women will receive free admission to the company’s Shipwreck Island Water Park. Jen Kramer, the famous Las Vegas magician will also perform for the lucky visitors.</p>
<p>“It is our honor to welcome and pamper thousands of the most deserving American heroes for a weekend filled with great music, beautiful weather and patriotism.“ David Siegel, founder, president and CEO at Westgate Resorts</p>
<p>Westgate Resorts’ founder, president and CEO, David Siegel, revealed that the company is delighted to once again serve thousands of American heroes. He explained that the unique weekend will deliver incredible experiences for the visitors during a weekend filled with patriotism. Last but not least, Siegel said: “Having served in the military myself, I know the importance of quality family time for those who are actively serving or who have recently served our country.”</p>
