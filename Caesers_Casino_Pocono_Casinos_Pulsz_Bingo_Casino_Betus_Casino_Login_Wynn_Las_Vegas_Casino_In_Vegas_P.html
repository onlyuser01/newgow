<p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), has posted a financial report for the first half of 2022 and the data states that its YoY revenue has increased by 68.11%. In the period between January and June 2022, the total reported revenue reached P26.70 billion ($481.9 million).</p>
<p>PAGCOR’s Revenue Even Exceeded the Original Expectations</p>
<p>Originally, PAGCOR’s revenue expectations for the first half of 2022 were P24.4 billion ($440.4 million), however, the official report states that these expectations were exceeded by 9.39%.</p>
<p>The net income of PAGCOR was P2.15 billion ($38.8 million), which is a 2,630.51% increase compared to the P79.07 million ($1.4 million) made in H1 of 2021.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why PAGCOR recorded such massive growth compared to 2021 is the loosened COVID-19 restrictions. This is something that was noted by PAGCOR’s CEO and chairman, Andrea Domingo earlier this year.</p>
<p>She stated that the gaming industry was poised to grow due to the businesses re-opening as a result of the eased movement restrictions. PAGCOR has been extremely successful under her wing, as shown by official reports.</p>
<p>The Philippine Regulator’s Nation-Building Contributions Were Mesmerizing</p>
<p>In terms of contributing toward nation-building, PAGCOR handed out P21.23 billion ($383.2 million) in H1 of 2022, which is 62.69% more compared to the same period in 2021.</p>
<p>The National Treasury received P11.71 billion ($211.4 million) as government share, the Bureau of Internal Revenue received P1.23 billion ($22.2 million) as franchise tax, and P6 billion ($108.3 million) was given as cash dividends.</p>
<p>Significant contributions were given to the Philippine Sports Commission, as it received P587.18 million ($10.6 million). The National Government Agencies received P52.39 million ($945,000), the Board of Claims under the Department of Justice received P22.7 million ($409,000) and the Dangerous Drugs Board received P30 million ($541,000).</p>
<p>PAGCOR is no stranger to being generous when it comes to nation-building. Back in June, the corporation received a commendation from Rodrigo Roa Duterte, the president of the Philippines, for vital contributions to the government’s COVID-19 responses.</p>
<p>Alfredo Lim, the president and COO of PAGCOR, received the reward on June 16. Lim stated that the commendation is a testament to the gaming firm’s efforts to build up its revenue and thus, provide more resources to the government to tackle various problems such as COVID-19.</p>
<p>Most recently, PAGCOR opened a multi-purpose evacuation center in Laguna. This facility is set to be used as a shelter during crisis times. If this scenario ever occurs, the facility will have all the necessities that sheltered people might need.</p>
<p>During peaceful times, the facility will be used to host many events, and hence, the spacious building will be able to accommodate a lot of participants.</p>
