    <h1>Wizard Of Oz Casino Slots Casino Abq New Mexico Caesars Casino Danville Va Harrington Casino Delawar</h1>

<p>I was told once verified the withdrawal process would take two business days well today makes the third business day when I contacted them they told me they had sent an email regarding the withdrawal well I checked my email there is no such email he proceeded to inform me that in addition to the two to three days business days it would take another week before they would be even processed through withdrawal now I have not been told this this entire time till today. today is the third business day I've been told by their reps every day this week that I would have it by Tuesday at the latest Wednesday and now they're telling me I'm looking at at least another week that withdrawal is still in pending nothing has been done to it I do not believe you should withhold information from your customers about withdrawals because some of us depend on that money but anyway the LIE is the main problem. I have emails that can prove everything I've just said from the first email from the support department stating that I would have my winnings by Tuesday and upon request I'll be more than happy to provide.</p>
