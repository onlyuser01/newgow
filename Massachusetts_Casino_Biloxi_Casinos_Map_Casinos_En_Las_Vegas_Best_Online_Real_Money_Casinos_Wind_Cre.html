    <h1>Massachusetts Casino Biloxi Casinos Map Casinos En Las Vegas Best Online Real Money Casinos Wind Cre</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru Team,</p>
<p>I recently created an account at King Billy and got 21 no deposit free spins there for registering. With a bit of luck, I was able to fully implement the winnings from the free spins. I'm no longer sure how big the win was, but after it was successfully implemented, this win was reduced back to €100 and I now had this €100 as real money credit in my account.</p>
<p>I haven't had this much luck with online slots in a long time so I decided to keep playing with this bankroll. I was also aware that I have to register for a withdrawal and have to have made a deposit. I wanted to catch up on all that after the weekend.</p>
<p>After a lucky streak, I earned a credit in the 4-digit range. I don't remember the exact amount. Something between 1000-2000€. I was about to set a loss limit so that I wouldn't lose everything again and take care of the payout. Nevertheless, I increased my bets for a few spins and was able to earn more than €10,000 with a couple of really nice hits. Since I had a good feeling, I played with the maximum bet of €50 given by king billy. After several hours of online slots and very good winnings, I had an account balance of just over €100,000 at the peak and finally landed at around €80,000 + lvl ups, loyalty points, etc. That's what happened to me in my 10-year term as player never happened.</p>
<p>Suddenly I couldn't start any more slots and it said my account was locked. After about an hour I was able to log in again and had to realize that my credit was only €100.</p>
<p>When I asked in the chat, I was told that the maximum win from the bonus was €100 and that the rest of my balance was confiscated.</p>
<p>I don't understand that because I have already wagered my bonus winnings and it was capped at €100 at the beginning.</p>
<p>Now I have this 100 € as a credit available again and I know that if I make a profit with it, sooner or later it will be reduced to the amount of 100 €.</p>
<p>So basically it's my own fault now if I play with it, because everything I win will be confiscated at some point anyway. Why is the amount available to play and shows up as real money? It is almost impossible to win with this €100.</p>
<p>If I had made a minimum deposit of €10 at some point in between, would I have kept my winnings? For example, when my credit was initially €2000.</p>
<p>Have you had similar cases and can you help me?</p>
<p>Thanks very much!</p>
