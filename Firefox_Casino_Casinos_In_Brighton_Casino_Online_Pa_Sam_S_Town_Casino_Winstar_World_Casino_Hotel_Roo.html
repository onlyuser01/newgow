    <h1>Firefox Casino Casinos In Brighton Casino Online Pa Sam S Town Casino Winstar World Casino Hotel Roo</h1>

<p>Hey Nicky,</p>
<p>I took the liberty of having your requested withdrawal approved mere moments ago, I will do my best to see that the payment goes out on your behalf as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I also took the liberty of taking the time to review literally every interaction you've had with the casino in every department in every form. We take misinformation seriously and if you had been informed that a $100 max chip had no maximum cashout I was determined to get to the bottom of it and take the necessary action to assure the agent in question was fully informed of the rules regarding free chips within our casino system.</p>
<p>On deep review I couldn't seem to locate an instance where you were informed anything beyond the actual cashout value of the chip of 1x or $100, it was mentioned a number of times in your email interactions. Could you provide a screenshot perhaps of where the chip was listed as no max cashout? If it is being advertised as no maximum cashout we need to know about it so we can assure other players such as yourself aren't mislead in the future, if you could shed any light on it it would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Every bonus we issue is worth very real cash if you meet the required terms and you have, without a doubt. The maximum possible amount available for cashout is indeed $100, while it's certainly not the $587 you were hoping for it's CASH, for FREE! There is always a bright side I believe and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>Moving forward towards your payday, I will need to confirm a bit of information before a check can be issued. I will send you an email in a few moments with those confirmation details. Please get back to me as soon as possible with those details and we can move from there. Also, if you can get me a screenshot of those faulty bonus rules send them to me there as well, thanks so much.</p>
<p>Best wishes, I hope this finds you well, and congrats on the win!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Nick and Club Player</p>
