<p>Fire in the Hole review</p>
<p>Fire In the Hole slot is themed around an old-fashioned gold mine.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the Fire In The Hole Slot is both cosy and exhilarating with the warm glow of lanterns illuminating the path ahead.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The background music is a loop of tension-inducing classical notes. Unfortunately, the repeat gets tiring quite quickly so players who would prefer not to have the distraction may opt to hit mute.</p>
<p>The animation style is consistent throughout the game and maintains high quality with various mining tools shaded dramatically. This creates the effect of lantern light and shadows. The gold symbols are especially eye-catching and seem to glow from within.</p>
<p>Set deep underground, this game is filled with pickaxes, rope, and leather boots. Players will amble down a rocky tunnel hoping to catch a glimpse of gold.</p>
<p>The mine tunnel in the background is animated beautifully and its depth is alluring though also intimidating. Players will be curious to explore this underground setting and see what it has to offer.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics and music of this game work well to create a mining world vibe.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fire in the Hole slot is a six reel slot. Players begin every spin with 3 rows and up to 6 rows can be triggered. The winways system means that the more rows there are, the more ways to win. These go from 486 win ways for three rows up to 46,656 win ways for six rows.</p>
<p>Rows can be unlocked by winning combinations, xBomb Wild explosions with no win, and the Wild Mining feature (see below for details).</p>
<p>Fire In the Hole Slot also has a cascade feature called the Collapsing Mine feature in which winning symbols vanish so that new symbols may fall down to take their place. Each "collapse" increases the number of rows by one.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels from left to right.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>When players land 3, 4, or 5 Bonus symbols they begin the Lucky Wagons free spins feature. They will begin with 3 spins and these will be reset anytime a coin lands on the reels.</p>
<p>Main bonus feature of the game, the Lucky Wagon spins</p>
<p>The xBomb Wild symbol can substitute for all symbols except the Bonus symbol. The xBomb Wild works by removing adjacent symbols except for Bonus symbols. It also increases the win multiplier for the next collapse.</p>
<p>The xBomb Wilds will explode and trigger a collapse, regardless of whether it is part of a win or not.</p>
<p>Players trigger the Wild Mining feature when 3, 4, or 5 matching symbols align horizontally but there is no winning combination. Those symbols will vanish, creating Wilds in the middle of their alignment. The number of Wilds created increases with the number of matching symbols.</p>
