<p>While 2021 didn’t give us much to be cheerful about, the lottery winnings in British Columbia, Canada, managed to set a record in total winnings paid out to players. The British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) reported that it paid out over $891 million in total prizes, which includes $23 million paid specifically to players from the Kootenay region.</p>
<p>Record Breaking Results for British Columbia</p>
<p>BCLC managed to sell a record number of tickets as well with over 102 million tickets sold to customers through the lottery’s retail outlet and online shop. The pandemic should have in theory tampered with the appetite for tickets and games of chance, but it had the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest winners throughout the year included Christine Lauzon who managed to win $70 million on the Lotto Max jackpot in September, which makes her the largest single-prize winner the lottery has ever seen in its history.</p>
<p>BCLC interim president and CEO Lynda Cavanaugh was pleased with the results, pointing out that the lottery has served its purpose well throughout the year, raising additional tax revenue for the state and making many people happy along the way:</p>
<p>“As 2021 wraps up, we’re celebrating all of our players and so many amazing, life-changing dreams that came true for lottery winners.” BCLC interim president and CEO Lynda Cavanaugh</p>
<p>Supporting the Budget and Local Player Communities</p>
<p>Cavanaugh thanked the players who had participated in the lottery throughout the year, pointing out that the province of British Columbia was the one to ultimately benefit. The lottery, Cavanaugh argued, continued to support communities that players lived in.</p>
<p>“It’s a win-win-win, and today we’re celebrating the 3.8 million winning tickets sold in the Kootenay region in 2021.” BCLC interim president and CEO Lynda Cavanaugh</p>
<p>Regardless of the record-setting handle, the BCLC has confirmed that it remains committed to responsible gambling throughout all of its operations. British Columbians stand to benefit from a lottery that is fully committed to keeping any risk behavior at bay and promoting a responsible play where games of chances are a form of entertainment.</p>
<p>The BCLC is also involved in the newly regulated sports betting market, which has given the state-owned giant more opportunities to deliver on sterling gambling results. In the first two months of operation, the BCLC’s PlayNow.com website has managed to collect a total of $25 million worth in sports bets placed.</p>
