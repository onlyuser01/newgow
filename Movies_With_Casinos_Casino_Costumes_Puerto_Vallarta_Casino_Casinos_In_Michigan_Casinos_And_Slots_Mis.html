<p>The lawsuit against Penn National Gaming and two of its casinos alleged employees' paychecks were unlawfully reduced</p>
<p>Last year, casino workers in Missouri filed a class action lawsuit against Penn National Gaming and two of its casinos in the state, the Argosy Riverside Casino and Hollywood Casino St. Louis. In their lawsuit, the workers claimed that the trio breached multiple laws by illegally reducing their paychecks. Allegations filed by the casino workers claimed the companies reduced their paychecks to cover costs for maintaining, obtaining and renewing gaming licenses for Missouri.</p>
<p>Further allegations filed by the workers claimed the aforementioned companies created a tip pool applicable for table game dealers. Those tips were allegedly then used to cover paid time off for employees who were non-tipped such as supervisors and managers.</p>
<p>Judge Approves a $5.5 Million Settlement</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Penn National Gaming, Argosy Riverside Casino and Hollywood Casino breached the Fair Labor Standards Act. The casino workers alleged breaches of the Missouri Minimum Wage Law and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.</p>
<p>Representing the plaintiffs are lawyers George A. Hanson, Alexander T. Ricke from Stueve Siegel Hanson LLP, as well as Ryan L. McClelland and Michael J. Rahmberg of McClelland Law Firm, P.C.</p>
<p>According to a report released by Missouri Lawyers Media, a judge recently approved a $5.5 million settlement, siding with the casino workers. US District Judge Stephen R. Bough, gave an initial approval last year in January. Now, as confirmed in the recent report, the judge gave final approval for the settlement of the lawsuit on May 25.</p>
<p>From the approved $5.5 million settlement, some 35% will be allocated toward attorneys’ fees. The Kaufman Fund along with Angels’ Arms, two charity organizations are going to benefit from unspent money.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Missouri, twelve ballot initiatives will seek to pave the way for legal sports betting across the state. Supported by professional sports teams and legislators, the activity is yet to be legalized across Missouri. Each of the 12 proposals can appear on the Ballot in November, subject to collecting a minimum of 171,592 signatures by May this year.</p>
