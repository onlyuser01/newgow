<p>DraftKings and the Professional Fighters League (PFL) entered into a multi-year partnership under which the Boston-based gaming brand was designated the Official Sportsbook and Daily Fantasy Partner of the league.</p>
<p>“We are excited to further our relationship with the Professional Fighters League as their first official betting and daily fantasy partner.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>Unique Prop Bets</p>
<p>The new agreement announced ahead of the start of the MMA 2021 season on April 23 will allow DraftKings to leverage PFL’s SmartCage technology and offer unique prop bets and gaming opportunities to fans of mixed martial arts across the country, pending regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with DraftKings as we look to advance the sport by delivering a premium and unique betting and gaming experience to the millions of passionate MMA fans in the US.” Peter Murray, CEO, PFL</p>
<p>DraftKings will use real-time fighter data and analytics captured and distributed by the SmartCage technology utilized by the PFL to track fighter performance via metrics such as punch speed, kick speed, fighter tracking, heart rate and caloric burn, to introduce innovative and distinctive prop bets.</p>
<p>“Our SmartCage technology and unique season format are integral components of PFL and will enable us to offer unmatched prop bets and gaming opportunities. MMA’s league is back with our season debut this Friday, April 23 in primetime on ESPN2, ESPN+ and ESPN Deportes.” Peter Murray, CEO, PFL</p>
<p>In November last year, the PFL partnered with IBM distributor Flagship Group Solutions to add IBM machine learning to the operating via sensors placed inside the octagon SmartCage platform and improve data collection.</p>
<p>“MMA is mainstream. The fan is young, loyal, passionate, and engaged, and PFL delivers an innovative product. We look forward to bringing a premium betting and fantasy experience to this growing audience in what is a monumental partnership for combat sports and the gaming industry.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>Odds Integration and Branding, Additional Pool Prizes</p>
<p>The Official Sportsbook and Daily Fantasy partner designation will see live DraftKings odds being integrated into every PFL event broadcast across the ESPN and streaming platforms, and during the league’s pre-fight show DraftKings will present, co-hosted by Jonathan Coachman, a former college basketball player, and former MMA fighter Ian Parker.</p>
<p>The partnership with the No. 2 MMA company in the world will provide for DraftKings’ logos to feature in and around the cage and for the brand to exclusively use the “Official Partner” designation for promotions and advertising, while both partners will collaborate across digital channels and social media content.</p>
<p>In turn, DraftKings will offer fans of MMA a chance to win cash prizes on top of PFL-branded pools related to events from the regular season, the playoffs, as well as from championship events, to expand on the 2019 PFL Championship Pick’Em game.</p>
