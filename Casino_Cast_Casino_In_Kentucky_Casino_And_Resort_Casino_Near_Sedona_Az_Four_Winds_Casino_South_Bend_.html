<p>The leading online marketing company catering to the global gambling sector, B90 Holdings plc, strengthened its C-suite with two new strategic appointments. The company revealed on Monday it hired the services of Andrew McIver for the role of Non-Executive Director. Judging by a statement, he joins B90 Holdings, effective immediately.</p>
<p>McIver's career started with Arthur Andersen LLP where he served as a Chartered Accountant. After this role, he moved to corporate finance at Kleinworth Benson. His professional background includes Non-Executive Director roles for AIM-quoted and private companies. Additionally, he was the Director of Finance for House of Fraser plc.</p>
<p>The industry expert was a part of British Telecom plc, Signet Group plc (now Signet Group Limited), as well as Hilton Group Finance plc (now Ladbrokes Group Finance plc). Throughout McIver's professional career, he was a part of Sportingbet plc, the leading online gaming company. He spent more than 10 years with the company, holding leadership roles such as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Group Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>More recently, McIver was a part of one of the largest online bingo operators, Jackpotjoy plc. This was between 2016 and 2018 when he served as Group Chief Executive. Under his guidance, Jackpotjoy successfully advanced its listing to the London Stock Exchange. He also played an important part in the restructuring of the company's operations.</p>
<p>Besides the aforementioned companies, McIver was a part of Planet Win/SKS365 Malta Ltd, the leading Italian gambling company. For the last three years, he held the role of Non-Executive Chairman, contributing toward the growth of EBITDA from £25m to £65m.</p>
<p>In addition to McIver's appointment, B90 Holdings confirmed another strategic change. The company revealed that the recently hired consultant, Farzad Peyman, was now elevated to the permanent role of Chief Finance and M&amp;A Development Officer. In his new role, Peyman will help strengthen B90's financial and M&amp;A structure.</p>
<p>Ronny Breivik, B90's Executive Chairman, shared his excitement about the two senior-level appointments. "I am delighted to welcome Andrew and Farzad to B90," he said. Breivik added: "I have had the privilege to know and work with Andrew for many years, a respected individual in the gaming industry, with a wealth of unmatched experience."</p>
<p>Speaking about Peyman, he acknowledged the significant knowledge and experience he brings to B90 Holdings. Breivik said that he will be excited to work once again with Peyman.</p>
<p>B90's Executive Chairman pointed out that the recent changes follow the appointment of Mark Blandford as Strategic Adviser earlier this year. "Our team looks forward to pooling our vast insight, knowledge, strategic experience, and networks to capitalize on opportunities which we have in our sight, and with a clear and open runway for growth," explained Breivik in conclusion.</p>
