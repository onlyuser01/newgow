<p>Jon Jones is making his heavyweight debut this Saturday, some three years after his last fight. He’s fighting for the vacant title against Cyril Gane at UFC 285 in Vegas</p>
<p>Jon Jones vs Cyril Gane is the main event of UFC 285, and one of the most exciting heavyweight fights in years. Jones, who’s widely considered the light heavyweight GOAT has a chance to win the title in the heavyweight division. The only obstacle standing in his way comes in the form of Gane.</p>

<p>Jon Jones Hasn’t Been This Big and Strong Ever</p>
<p>Jon “Bones” Jones is 26-1-1 in his professional career, but one may argue that he’s actually 28-0. His only loss was a disqualification for illegal elbows in a fight that he was winning. The fight that was declared no contest was originally a KO win for Jones over Daniel Cormier in the title fight. The win was overturned after Jones tested positive for a banned substance.</p>
<p>In his pro career, Jones has defeated a number of elite fighters, including the aforementioned DC, but also Lyoto Machida, Vitor Belfort, Chael Sonnen, Alexander Gustafsson, Glover Teixeira, and others.</p>
<p>Jones is famous for being a fighter who likes beating his opponents with their own weapons. He outwrestled Cormier, KO-d Gustafsson, and so on. Will he try to outbox Cyril Gane on Saturday? MMA experts don’t think so. Instead, they think Jones will focus on Gane’s Achilles’ heel, which seems to be grappling.</p>
<p>Cyril Gane Needs More Weapons to Defeat Jones</p>
<p>Cyril “Bon Gamin” Gane (11-1) is a heavyweight who moves like a middleweight. This explains why in the title bout against Francis Ngannou, he didn’t get hit too many times. Instead, Gane lost that fight because Ngannou completely outgrappled him.</p>
<p>No one expected that Ngannou was going to grapple, not even Gane, which is the No. 1 reason why he lost the title bout. This time, however, he’s probably ready for the fight on the floor. Of course, the question is whether he’ll need to use his grappling skills at all.</p>
<p>The thing is that Gane is a fantastic kickboxer with Muay Thai experience who’s got a much longer reach than Jones. He does seem to have what it takes to keep his opponent at a distance.</p>
<p>Jon Jones vs Cyril Gane Prediction</p>
<p>Jon Jones’ path to victory is to take the fight to the ground. If he wants to win the title, Cyril Gane will have to outbox his opponent. So, which tactic will prevail?</p>
<p>Betting odds are leaning in Jones’ favor, but we think that the three-year hiatus will take its toll. Jones isn’t fast enough to keep up with Gane, who also has fists made of steel and is going to hurt Jones with his punches.</p>
<p>Still, we do not think Gane will knock him out. Instead, he’ll try to land as many significant strikes as possible in order to win by decision.</p>
<p>Pick: Cyril Gane to win by decision</p>
