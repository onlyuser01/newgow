<p>Dear Nemokid,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly, and I am afraid you will have to go through this process if you want to get your winnings.</p>
<p>Have you been advised what exactly seems to be a problem in verifying your account?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
