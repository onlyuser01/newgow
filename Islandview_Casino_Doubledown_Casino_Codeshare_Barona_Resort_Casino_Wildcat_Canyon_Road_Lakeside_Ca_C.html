    <h1>Islandview Casino Doubledown Casino Codeshare Barona Resort Casino Wildcat Canyon Road Lakeside Ca C</h1>

<p>On the 3rd of May 2020 after being informed by support staff that the maximum allowed cash out per day at the casino is $3,200 I requested exactly that amount out of the $6,000 I had won to be withdrawn to my VISA.</p>
<p>I had successfully made one withdrawal from Bao up until this point as I am a fairly new player there, this request was for $400 on the 21st of April 2020 and was paid out with no delay and since then my account has been verified.</p>
<p>The $3,200 was then rejected by finance dept and an email from them asked that in order to ensure a successful withdrawal could I please break my $3,200 single request down into 3x $1000 and 1x $200 so I did this and was assured nothing else was required from me.</p>
<p>I first began the withdrawal process at 9.30am and at 2.20pm the first $1,000 withdrawal was accepted followed by the second one at 4.07pm then the final one at 9.46pm.</p>
<p>At 9.56pm I received an email from support informing me that my withdrawal request had been cancelled due to "technical reasons" with no further information such as whether it was the whole $3,200 they were referring to or how long approximately they wanted me to be kind enough to just wait, I am still waiting and have still haven't been given any clarity to the issue from support staff and need assistance with getting answers and more importantly the remainder of the money I am entitled to.</p>
<p>I feel frustrated and the longer it goes on the less trust I have in them resolving it as I have attempted to contact them about it maybe twice between the 5th of May and now, trying to observe their request that I be patient and they seem uninterested and hopeful I will become the same and just forget that I am owed the $1,000.</p>
<p>Had they been less vague when responding to me and more assuring I wouldn't be here now trying to get help as I would be confident and happy to wait whatever length of time.</p>
<p>When I made my first request to cash out on the 3rd of May I was so excited as a single mum to be getting $3,200 in extra funds and in my head I had imagined I could do a few things I have been waiting a long time to do with my kids and also be able to spoil them with whatever their hearts desired! The two $1000 I did receive had been spaced out so much they arrived in my bank account on separate days then I reversed the $200 as it sat there pending far to long.</p>
<p>I hope to get a relatively quick outcome now I have formally complained and thank you to anyone who helps ðŸ™‚</p>
