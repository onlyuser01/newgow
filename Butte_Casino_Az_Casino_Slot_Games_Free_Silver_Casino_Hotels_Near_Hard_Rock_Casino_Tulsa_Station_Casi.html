<p>Zitro Digital is a fantastic addition to the Fusion platform, according to Ashley Bloor, director of partnerships at Pariplay</p>
<p>Pariplay, a NeoGames-owned content supplier and aggregator has signed a new content partnership with Zitro Digital, a provider of online gambling. As agreed, the latter company will inject content into Pariplay’s Fusion aggregation platform.</p>
<p>The partnership will expand Zitro Digital’s presence, allowing it to benefit from the extensive reach offered by the Fusion platform. Zitro, which already enjoys a strong presence in land-based casinos, will thus be able to expand its online foothold as well.</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Zitro Digital will bring its famous bingo and slots into Pariplay’s platform, allowing the latter company to launch this content with many prominent operators in various key markets.</p>
<p>The agreement is in line with Zitro Digital’s ambitious growth plans. A leader in retail gambling, Zitro now seeks to replicate its success in the digital sector. The company’s content enjoys a lot of popularity in Latin America and Spain and is steadily growing in other regions as well.</p>
<p>As for Pariplay, the new deal will boost its Fusion content offering, powering it with many new titles. The platform recently onboarded content from other notable gambling content suppliers, including EQL Games and Galaxsys. The platform currently encompasses some 14,000+ games from more than 120 suppliers and comprehensive back-office conversion and retention tools.</p>
<p>Zitro’s Content Is a Perfect Fit for Fusion</p>
<p>Zitro Digital’s chief operations officer, José Javier Martí, said that his team is always looking to deliver cutting-edge tech and content to the iGaming sector. To that end, his team chose to collaborate with Pariplay and integrate its content into the Fusion platform. As a result, Zitro’s content will now reach many new operators.</p>
<p>We’re world leaders in video bingo and our slots have seen continued growth due to their differentiation and innovation, so we’re keen to expand our presence online and bring our games to even more players together with Pariplay. José Javier Martí, COO, Zitro Digital</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ashley Bloor, Pariplay’s director of partnerships, said:</p>
<p>We’re proud of how much our Fusion offering has grown, and Zitro Digital is a fantastic addition to the platform. Ashley Bloor, director of partnerships, Pariplay</p>
<p>Bloor explained that Zitro Digital’s high-quality content, top-range tech and commitment to innovation are well-suited for the fusion platform. She added that her team is always looking to expand the platform with the best titles from the very best suppliers.</p>
<p>Bloor concluded that she is certain the current deal is the start of a strong and successful partnership.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Zitro Games agreed to deliver more games to the VICCA Group in Colombia.</p>
