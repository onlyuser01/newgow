    <h1>Boomtown Casino Bossier City How Do Casinos Make Money On Poker Wow Vegas Casino Online Hollywood Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>I was on a perfectly ordinary normal day gambling to entertain myself. Later that day when I wanted to pay out my money, that didn't work. My account was closed from the casino, but was able to login with a message asking me to verify (KYC). I understand that this is necessary and of course I have no problem with it.</p>
<p>Only I have been waiting for 4 months now for this process to be completed.</p>
<p>When they need documents I will of course send them to you, after having approved it they will ask for extra again and this has been going on for 4 months. I want to be able to withdraw my money and I am leaving the casino as soon as possible because this is really not fun to play.</p>
<p>Time when it is viewed or approved no idea from the casino side. What is being told is that you have to wait but until when. this really bothers me.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can help me with this.</p>
<p>Adnan</p>
