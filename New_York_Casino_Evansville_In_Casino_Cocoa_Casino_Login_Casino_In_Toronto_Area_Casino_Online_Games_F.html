<p>Pariplay continues its expansion in North America. The leading aggregator and content provider inked a content deal with BetMGM on Thursday this week.</p>
<p>BetMGM Joins Forces with Pariplay</p>
<p>Aspire Global’s leading aggregator and content provider, Pariplay, announced on Thursday this week that it inked an agreement with BetMGM. Under the deal, Pariplay will provide its content as well as third-party content for BetMGM players in New Jersey and Michigan.</p>
<p>Moreover, the deal provides an opportunity for Pariplay to continue expanding into other live regulated markets soon. The new collaboration complements Pariplay’s ongoing expansion in the US. The operator revealed that it plans on becoming a leading content supplier for North America. This makes the content agreement a strategic step for Pariplay.</p>
<p>Only recently, Pariplay inked multiple key deals to supply its content via its Fusion platform. The innovative platform offers 120 proprietary titles, but it is also featuring thousands of games from leading game developers. What is even more, the Fusion platform features conversion and retention tools which are incredibly useful for the operators.</p>
<p>Pariplay Remains Focused on Growth</p>
<p>BetMGM’s VP of Gaming, Matthew Sunderland, acknowledged that Pariplay offers content that is well-received by the players. He acknowledged that the new partnership complements BetMGM’s world-class offering by adding new titles that will engage and entertain the players.</p>
<p>It’s important to mention that BetMGM is a joint venture between Entain and MGM Resorts. Before this agreement, Pariplay already had an existing collaboration with Entain, providing its content for key markets around Europe such as the UK, Germany, Denmark and Portugal.</p>
<p>Pariplay offers an abundance of well-liked content.” Matthew Sunderland, VP of gaming at BetMGM</p>
<p>Pariplay’s VP of sales, Andrew Maclean, also shared his excitement about the new deal. He outlined that Pariplay has gained momentum by expanding in the US market and it is thrilling to join forces at such a time with BetMGM. Additionally, Maclean said that Pariplay is looking forward to a successful collaboration that will boost the company’s presence across North America.</p>
<p>Our momentum in the US market is showing no signs of slowing down and we are thrilled to partner with BetMGM to continue that progress.” Andrew Maclean, VP of sales at Pariplay</p>
<p>Looking to boost expansion, earlier this week, Pariplay appointed Enrico Bradamante as its new Chief Commercial Officer (CCO). By appointing Bradamante, the company plans to expand not only across North American jurisdictions but throughout other key markets worldwide.</p>
