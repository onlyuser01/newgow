<p>Tull, 53, pleaded no contest in Las Vegas Justice Court to a misdemeanor charge of a being a public official who disobeyed laws regarding their conduct. Justice of the Peace Harmony Letizia ordered Tull to pay a $500 fine, and the case was settled.</p>
<p>In part of the arrangement, the court dismissed two felony charges of theft and misconduct of a public officer, which carried potential prison time. By pleading no contest, Tull did not admit guilt, but acknowledged there might be enough evidence to warrant a conviction at trial.</p>
<p>Tull, her ex-boss, LVCVA CEO Rossi Ralenkotter, and former LVCVA Director of Business Partnerships Brig Lawson were criminally accused of devising a scheme in which tax funds allocated to the Las Vegas tourism and marketing agency were used to purchase $90,000 worth of Southwest gift cards. The airline credits were allegedly used by the trio for personal travel.</p>
<p>The LVCVA was founded in 1955 with the mission of increasing tourism to Southern Nevada.</p>
<p>Sweet Deals</p>
<p>Ralenkotter reached a similar deal with the Justice Court last month. He pleaded no contest to the same misdemeanor charge and was fined $1,000.</p>
<p>Law enforcement alleged that Ralenkotter used nearly $17,000 worth of Southwest credit for personal travel, and Tull $6,000. Audits could not account for more than $50,000 worth of the cards.</p>
<p>Ralenkotter’s base salary prior to his resignation was $440,000. He was receiving a nearly $300,000 annual state pension, plus a $15,000 per month consultant fee. Despite the criminal charges against them, neither was booked at the Clark County Detention Center, not fingerprinted, or had their mug shots taken.</p>
<p>Both Rallenkotter and Tull repaid the LVCVA before their departures.</p>
<p>The case against Lawson is ongoing. The felony charges against Eric Woodson, the former Southwest marketing executive who was linked to the scheme, have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Negative Press</p>
<p>The LVCVA’s recent scandals have certainly put a black eye on the agency.</p>
<p>Critics have long lambasted the LVCVA’s robust annual budget, which was $358.15 million during the 2020 fiscal year. It’s been slashed, largely due to the coronavirus and a drastic drop in Clark County room taxes, by 43 percent. It now stands at $206.6 million for the 2021 FY.</p>
<p>In a 2017 probe by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the media outlet found that the Authority expensed $700,000 on alcohol and $85,000 on “adult entertainment” during a three-year period.</p>
<p>Weekly was accused of taking his daughter on a trip to Dallas with $1,400 in Southwest gift card money. He returned the funds, but remains a commissioner and on the LVCVA board.</p>
