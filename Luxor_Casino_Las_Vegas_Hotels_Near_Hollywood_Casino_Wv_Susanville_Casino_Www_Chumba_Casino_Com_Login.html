<p>House of Doom review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>House of Doom appears to be half a haunted house themed slot, half death metal album cover borrowed from Candlemass’ 2018 album of the same name. As such it has a decidedly cool series of images to work with, the looming Amityville churchyard full of skulls in the background, the roses and pentacles and of course the blaring electric guitars on the soundtrack.</p>
<p>It is a really original tone in a market saturated by the broadest of geographical (under the sea for example) and historical themes (goldrush, Egypt, Vikings…). Let’s rock!</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>As suggested above the highly original theme is brought to life with a pleasing array of artistic choices.</p>
<p>The music is the most obvious one with its dirty guitar riffs and organ backing tracks. This goes well with the album cover style of the art which makes for some gorgeous and sinister symbols on all the reels.</p>
<p>This is all topped off with high-quality animation which is never overblown but adds a little visual variety to each shift of the game from spin to win.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is fairly basic. The main game is a simple five reel slot with ten winlines and a basic bonus game of free spins along with a point and click Skulls of the Abyss bonus game.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature or other mini-games to speak of, so you need to be sure you enjoy the main game if you are in it for the long haul.</p>
<p>Big win in a bonus feature, Skulls of Abyss</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Unlike most slots, House of Doom has two Wild symbols which will play as any symbol except for the Scatter symbol. The second Wild making its appearance in the bonus game.</p>
<p>The Wilds also pay out if you hit two or more symbols. Two Wilds will only get you half your bet per spin, while if you manage to hit five Wilds you take down one hundred times your bet per spin.</p>
<p>A random reel is highlighted every spin and if you hit a wild, it expands to fill the reel.</p>
<p>The Skull symbol does not pay out, but if you hit three of them you get to play the Skulls of the Abyss bonus game in which you get 15 skulls to choose from. Beneath each skull is either a cash prize amount, a prize of further free picks or one of the End symbols which finishes the bonus game. House of Doom symbol ends this bonus game but you get to play the free spin bonus instead.</p>
<p>One of the bonus features - Skulls of Abyss</p>
<p>There is also the House of Doom symbol, but the real reason you want to hit the House of Doom symbol is that hitting three or more triggers a free spin bonus. You receive 10 free spins during which instead of one reel, two to five reels are selected each spin for the Wild expansion.</p>
<p>During the free Spins the House of Doom symbol also becomes a Wild symbol, working in the exact same way as the usual Wild symbol.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The RTP of 96.11% is pretty run of the mill. We tend to take 96% as our middle ground, higher than that is good, lower is bad, but when it is this close we just have to call it neutral.</p>
<p>What we do really like about the game is its high volatility, which lends itself to working with many of our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable</p>
<p>Couple this with the reasonable range of bets from €/£/$0.30 to €/£/$90.00 per spin on the site we tested, the numbers for this game are quite encouraging.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>House of Doom is great slot created by Play'n GO. As well as being a lot of fun it is well designed, nice to look at, and more than a little cool.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is epic and the variance is high. While the RTP isn’t especially high, it also isn’t especially low.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend this game.</p>
