<p>Bally’s Corporation and daily fantasy and sports betting operator FanDuel opened up the FanDuel Sportsbook at Bally’s Atlantic City Hotel &amp; Casino, to mark the first retail sports wagering operation for the Flutter-owned brand in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be one the first pieces of the Capital Improvement Project at Bally’s Atlantic City Casino &amp; Hotel.” Keith Wall, Vice President, Retail, FanDuel Group</p>
<p>Capital Improvements Begin</p>
<p>The 1,251-room property located at the center of the Atlantic City’s boardwalk was acquired by Bally’s Corporation in a $25 million deal in November from Caesars Entertainment and its real estate investment trust (REIT) VICI Properties. By the time of the acquisition, Bally’s CEO George Papanier noted the property would be revamped with capital improvements to offer first-in-class amenities.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to announce the opening of the FanDuel Sportsbook at Bally’s AC. It is the first of many planned capital improvement projects at Bally’s Atlantic City and a testament to our commitment to reinvest in our physical property portfolio.” George Papanier, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>The temporary wagering facility will have 6 live odds boards, 10 self-service betting kiosks and 3 live betting windows providing assistance to each client, and will operate in compliance with health and safety guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and local authorities.</p>
<p>“While we are eager to get up and running with our temporary sportsbook, we cannot wait until we open the permanent location and showcase to Atlantic City why FanDuel is the number one sportsbook in New Jersey.” Keith Wall, Vice President, Retail, FanDuel Group</p>
<p>Exclusive Game-Day Atmosphere</p>
<p>The permanent FanDuel Sportsbook which is expected to open in the spring of 2021 will span across 4,100 square feet on the main casino floor and will feature a luxury 80-seat lounge, 30 club chairs and huge LED video walls, to ensure an unforgettable game-day atmosphere.</p>
<p>The FanDuel Sportsbook will run on the International Game Technology (IGT) PlaySports platform and will utilize the proprietary risk and trading algorithms of FanDuel to ensure the best offering for bettors. The temporary facility will function until design and construction works at the permanent location of the sportsbook which are currently underway complete.</p>
<p>“We are also looking forward to once again implementing the winning combination of Bally’s nationwide expertise in gaming and casino operations, with FanDuel’s market-leading sports betting acumen and globally recognized brand, to provide an unrivaled sportsbook experience for our loyal Atlantic City customers.” George Papanier, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>Bettors will have at their disposal 34 self-servicing IGT PlaySports betting kiosks and 5 attended live betting windows accepting bets on all major US sports, including baseball, basketball, football, soccer, golf, motorsport racing, boxing and many others.</p>
