<p>The bus, heading to a casino, had a total of 25 bus passengers of which 10 were injured, while 15 lost their lives</p>
<p>A recent road accident has taken the lives of 15 people near Carberry, a small city located about 100 miles away from Winnipeg, the capital and the biggest city of the Canadian province of Manitoba. Rob Hill, the Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s (RCMP) commanding officer, confirmed that an investigation into the crash has started and the first responders were dispatched to the crash, ABCNews reveals.</p>
<p>What’s known so far is that a total of 25 people were riding a bus that was heading on a trip to a casino. In the crash, the bus and a semi-trailer truck collided, resulting in the death of 15 people. On the other hand, 10 people who survived the devastating crash injured were taken to hospitals for further treatment.</p>
<p>“The news from Carberry, Manitoba is incredibly tragic. I’m sending my deepest condolences to those who lost loved ones today, and I’m keeping the injured in my thoughts.“ Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau, Canada’s Prime Minister, deemed the news about the accident as heartbreaking. He sent his condolences to the family and friends of the people who died in the crash. Finally, Trudeau noted: “I cannot imagine the pain those affected are feeling – but Canadians are here for you.”</p>
<p>A Tragic Road Accident</p>
<p>According to RCMP Supt. Rob Lasson, “the drivers of both the bus and truck are alive and in hospital.” The people that died in the crash were mostly seniors from the Dauphin senior center. The bus left on Thursday morning and was reportedly heading to Sand Hills Casino located in Carberry.</p>
<p>“The public is reeling and asking a lot of questions and people are trying to determine if their loved ones were involved. Death on this scale is never normalized for us.“ RCMP Supt. Rob Lasson</p>
<p>Lasson said that what’s known so far is that the bus was driving south and near a crossing, it collided with a truck that was going east. Whether or not one of the drivers made a mistake and how exactly the accident happened is still subject to investigation.</p>
<p>Still, Lasson acknowledged that tragic accidents at such a scale are uncommon, which is why the public wants to know what caused the accident. Given that an investigation is ongoing, local authorities did not disclose the names of the deceased seniors in the crash.</p>
