<p>Dear Danča,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the T&amp;Cs (https://22bet.com/ca/information/rules/2) and I found this:</p>
<p>"37. Upon completion of the investigation, the company can make any decision that it deems to be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>to block (close) the account (including any duplicate accounts), which may entail:</p>
<p>all bonuses, free bets and winnings received from those bonuses and free bets when using this duplicate account becoming void and lost to you</p>
<p>at our sole discretion, to cancel all winnings and refund the balance of your account at the start of the investigation (minus any canceled winnings) made from your main and duplicate accounts. We also have the right to refund any amounts that are owed to us in connection with this duplicate account, directly from any of your accounts (including any other duplicate account).</p>
<p>At our sole discretion (in exceptional cases), to allow the continued use of the main account and recognize it as valid, while all bets placed by you from the duplicate account will be void, the duplicate account(s) will be blocked and/or canceled by decision of the company (the decision is made for each particular case individually, according to the extent of the violation)."</p>
<p>Is there any chance, that someone from your household or using the same IP address has created an account at this casino too?</p>
<p>Have you accumulated your winnings with or without an active bonus?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
