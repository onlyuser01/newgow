<p>The leading online gaming operator that has a strong presence in strategic global markets such as Latin America and Spain, Codere Online, announced a new senior-level appointment. News about the appointment emerged Thursday during the company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM). As a result, Codere Online confirmed that it appointed Michal Elimelech, an expert with more than a decade of experience, as a member of its Board of Directors.</p>

Most recently, she was a part of Passiflora and Space Ape Games where she served as COO and CMO respectively. However, Elimelech’s professional tenure includes 15 years with the global gaming leader, 888 Holdings.</p>
<p>Throughout her extensive career with the company, she accumulated unique experience, gained invaluable insight and knowledge. Elimelech’s track record includes roles such as head of US marketing, head of developed markets EMEA and head of bingo, among other important executive roles. While a part of 888 Holdings, she played a key role in the company’s growth and expansion, helping it navigate through complex environments and overseeing a dedicated team of experts.</p>

<p>Sharing his excitement about Elimelech’s appointment, Ramsey said that the company is delighted to see her join the Board. “Her experience in digital marketing and expanding businesses into new markets is a perfect fit for Codere Online as it continues to pursue its growth plans in Spain and Latin America,” he said.</p>
