<p>GeoComply continues to grow the company’s team of experts with the addition of a new Chief Technology Officer. Vadim Jelezniakov is a tech industry veteran who previously served as Director of Engineering at Meta, the parent company of social media Facebook.</p>
<p>Jelezniakov is a strong pick for the geolocation specialist which relies on advanced technological solutions to maintain a safe iGaming and sports betting industry for all of its clients. In his career, the man has served with various technological giants, including Amazon and Google, and he did a stint at the New York Times.</p>
<p>He has been in charge of scaling and managing platforms reliably and sustainably across the regulated tech sector. Overall, he has more than 20 years working on various technological solutions and will help GeoComply better adapt to emerging market trends and technologies, which is important for a company which prides itself on its tech acumen and nous.</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment of its new CTO, GeoComply Co-Founder and CEO Anna Sainsbury said:</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to have Vadim join our team. With his impressive track record of innovation and leadership in the technology industry, I am very confident that he will help us continue to grow and stay ahead of the competition."</p>

<p>The company has provided invaluable insight into emerging sports betting markets in the United States and Canada, breaking down the numbers in terms of active users and transactions, but also offering a helpful safeguard against fraudulent operations.</p>
<p>GeoComply has been targeting activities such as the Super Bowl, March Madness, and new market launches. With the help of Jelezniakov, the company will reach even further into its target markets and bring even greater value.</p>
