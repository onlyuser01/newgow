<p>Dear boskoyann,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>„the credit/debit card or any other payment method that you use to top up your account balance belongs to you, is not stolen, and has not been lost by another person. Company reserves the right to close your account and void any winnings in case of a reasonable suspicion that you have violated this warranty."</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-players:</p>
<p>"Payments</p>
<p>For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing or withdrawing funds using a joint card or this possibility is communicated beforehand. Technically it is very difficult to check who’s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked only during account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested. Therefore, it is a player’s responsibility to use allowed payment methods only.</p>
<p>Could you please forward me the communication between you and the casino in which the casino allowed you to use a payment method that doesn't belong to you? You can send it to kristina.s@casino.guru. Alternatively, you can post it here.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
