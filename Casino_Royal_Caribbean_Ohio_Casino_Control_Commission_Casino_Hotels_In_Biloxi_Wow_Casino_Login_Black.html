<p>The new casino and boutique hotel offers supreme hospitality and 86 slot machines, along with a bar and a restaurant</p>
<p>Visitors to Deadwood, South Dakota are in for a treat, after Hard Rock International celebrated the opening of its newest boutique hotel and casino, offering different entertainment and hospitality options. A grand ceremony, commemorating the opening of the Rocksino by Hard Rock, took place earlier this week. The glamorous event saw the participation of the state’s governor, leaders of the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the South Dakota Sioux tribes, along with music stars and many guests.</p>
<p>The new Rocksino brings iconic Hard Rock hospitality, offering a boutique hotel and casino. The venue is slightly smaller in size than the usual Hard Rock resort properties, but it is still packed with entertaining options, including music memorabilia, a full-service restaurant and a bar that offers craft cocktails.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly the Rocksino offers gambling entertainment as well and visitors can play 86 new slot machines. As with other such entertainment locations, a Rock Shop is also available where visitors can purchase custom apparel from Hard Rock Deadwood. Judging by a statement released by Hard Rock, later this year, the property will open its renovated luxury guest rooms.</p>
<p>Celebrating the grand opening ceremony, Hard Rock Deadwood made a donation of $40,000 to the Oglala Sioux Tribe Veterans Shelter. The generous contribution came from the Hard Rock Heals Foundation in collaboration with the Willie G. Invitational Golf Tournament.</p>
<p>Besides the donation, the opening ceremony included Hard Rock’s popular Guitar Smash where 22 individuals appeared on stage, smashing guitars. However, Big Kenny, from the country music duo Big &amp; Rich, explained that the smashed guitars weren’t real guitars but rather Hollywood props. He outlined that thousands of real guitars are donated by Hard Rock to different communities around the globe.</p>
<p>Deadwood Expands Entertainment Options</p>
<p>David Ruth, Deadwood’s Mayor, praised the efforts of Steve Slowey and Marc Oswald, which helped deliver the iconic Hard Rock brand to one of the most popular Wild West towns in the US. “As a community famous for entertaining guests since 1876, Deadwood is excited to welcome Rocksino by Hard Rock Deadwood as our newest, can’t-miss property,” he said. Finally, Ruth pointed out that the new Rocksino will fit well with the region and deliver supreme experiences for its visitors.</p>
<p>“Our rich, Old West history combined with the Hard Rock brand will enhance the Deadwood experience for which we are known for. The Rocksino by Hard Rock Deadwood is sure to be an additional gem luring visitors to this amazing town.“ David Ruth, Mayor of Deadwood, South Dakota</p>
<p>South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem also attended the recent grand opening ceremony. She said that for years, different initiatives delivered unique experiences for visitors to Deadwood. Now, according to Gov. Noem, the new Rocksino will further expand the entertainment options available for visitors to the city.</p>
