<p>WIN Group, an esports platform that operates Winners.bet, has teamed up with Aspire Global to access the latter’s full turnkey services. As a result, WIN Group will tap into Aspire’s BtoBet platform that encompasses the full range of experiences, including casino and sports betting. This is the latest move by an esports-focused operator who is moving into other verticals.</p>
<p>Building Past the Esports Experience</p>
<p>WIN will benefit from Aspire’s dedicated PAM platform to optimize results. WIN Group will migrate its esports news website, win.gg, onto the BtoBet platform ready to offer an improved experience to its customers and explore new verticals at the same time. Aspire CEO Tsachi Maimon spoke highly of the esports segment:</p>
<p>“Esports is one of the most exciting segments in igaming and we are determined to lead the development in this important area. We look forward to working with WIN Group to create the world’s premier gaming experience in esports.” Aspire Global CEO Tsachi Maimon</p>
<p>Aspire has welcomed WIN Group’s approach which is multi-pronged and focuses on both delivering esports media coverage as well as building a dedicated esports betting platform. In the press release, Aspire called WIN the operator of “the biggest esports media site,” probably referring to the fact that out of esports betting operators on the market, WIN Group seems to invest the most in genuine media coverage from the world of esports.</p>
<p>WIN Group CEO Stephen Shoemaker said that the group was proud of what has been achieved. The expansion of Winners.bet is another important stepping stone for the company and the partnership with Aspire Global would help it pursue new ventures.</p>
<p>“As a market leader, we know that people betting on esports have high expectations for the user experience, and our research indicates that the platforms currently in the market haven’t matched their expectations.” WIN Group CEO Stephen Shoemaker</p>
<p>Shoemaker is confident that the changes introduced to the group’s platform this year would empower the experience for esports enthusiasts and other interested customers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aspire Global has been able to strike its second-biggest deal this year after previously teaming up with BoyleSports and its online betting platform BtoBet and helping the company enter the Dutch gaming market. This comes among strong results for Aspire Global posted last week with the company reporting a 14.7% increase in its Q4 revenues.</p>
