<p>Pennsylvania continues to see gamblers leave their children unattended in their vehicles outside the state’s 16 brick-and-mortar casinos. The problem has become a major issue for the state, and the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board’s (PGCB) has launched recent efforts to curb such incidences.</p>

<p>The PGCB in November launched a public service campaign called “Don’t Gamble with Kids.” The awareness message sought to warn gamblers about the dangers and possible criminal consequences associated with leaving a child unattended in a vehicle outside a casino.</p>
<p>The PGCB this week added four additional unattended child offenders to the state’s Involuntary Exclusion List.</p>
<p>The “black book’s” latest entries left children as young as two years old unattended in a vehicle. The offenders allegedly left a total of nine children alone in their vehicles while they gambled inside a casino.</p>
<p>Offenses Continue</p>
<p>The PGCB said this week that a male patron was placed on the prohibited list after Valley Forge Casino security officials located a 12-year-old in an unattended vehicle outside the resort. The child’s father admitted to leaving the child for five minutes to place a sports bet inside the property.</p>
<p>The PGCB placed another male on the Involuntary Exclusion List for leaving a 13-year-old unattended outside Harrah’s Philadelphia. He also left the child in the car to place sports bets inside the casino.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is home to legal online sports wagering.</p>
<p>A third person, a female patron, was banned this week after she left a two-year-old and 14-year-old unattended in her vehicle outside Mohegan Pennsylvania. The children were left unsupervised for more than two hours while the woman gambled inside on slot machines.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania also allows legal iGaming, with interactive slot machines and table games permitted online.</p>
<p>A fourth person was also banned this week. A male gambler reportedly left five children, an infant, and a 1-, 9-, 10-, and 14-year-old, in the Valley Forge Casino food court. The kids were left unsupervised for more than an hour.</p>
<p>The Board’s actions serve as a reminder that adults are prohibited from leaving minors unattended in the parking lot or garage, a hotel, or other venues at a casino since it creates a potentially unsafe and dangerous environment for the children,” a PGCB statement explained. “Leaving minors unattended at a Pennsylvania casino also subjects the offending adult to criminal prosecution in addition to exclusion from all Pennsylvania casinos.”</p>
<p>The PGCB said there were 303 incidences of adults leaving children unattended to gamble at Pennsylvania casinos in 2022. The incidences involved 486 minors.</p>
<p>Since 2022, the PGCB has added 34 people to the Involuntary Exclusion List for leaving children unsupervised.</p>
<p>Valley Forge Expands Hours</p>
<p>In other Pennsylvania gaming news, Valley Forge recently notified the state that the casino is returning to 24/7 operations. The property owned and operated by Boyd Gaming ended round-the-clock gaming amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The move to resume to all-day hour service speaks to the vitality of Valley Forge Casino Resort’s business and the health of the gaming and hospitality industry as a whole,” a Boyd statement read.</p>
<p>Slots and the cage, effectively immediately, are open 24 hours. Table games run from 10 a.m. through 4 a.m. Sunday to Thursday, and 10 a.m. through 5 a.m. Friday through Sunday morning. The FanDuel Sportsbook is open from 10 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week.</p>
