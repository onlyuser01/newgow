<p>The new game expands further the company's EasySwipe portfolio and delivers engaging experiences for the online players</p>
<p>The innovative games provider for the iGaming vertical, ESA Gaming, announced the launch of its newest title a part of its EasySwipe portfolio, Baccarat. This is the thirteenth game a part of EasySwipe.</p>
<p>The new game marks the company’s third casino table game, resonating well with Blackjack and European Roulette, which were previously released. Besides the launch of Baccarat, ESA Gaming confirmed that more classic casino table games are due to be released soon.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming’s head of marketing, Thomas Smallwood, acknowledged that the release of Baccarat marks only the first game from the planned rollout in 2023. Moreover, he predicted that the new card game will be well-received by customers online.</p>
<p>“Our 2023 content rollout is well underway with the release of our newest EasySwipe title, Baccarat, a classic casino card game which looks set to be a huge hit.“ Thomas Smallwood, head of marketing at ESA Gaming</p>
<p>At the same time, ESA Gaming’s head of marketing acknowledged that the new game expands further the company’s offering which further boosts fan engagement not only for its partners but customers as well. Finally, Smallwood acknowledged that the company continues to build up its portfolio and the latest title contributes to the variety.</p>
<p>Baccarat Delivers Engaging Experiences</p>
<p>Inspired by the classic card game, ESA Gaming’s Baccarat title offers an RTP of 98%. According to the title’s developer, the game is played between two hands, the banker and the player. There are a total of three outcomes: win by the banker, player or a tie.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming’s Baccarat game is quite appealing, considering that it is a high-volatility title. What’s more, the game offers players a chance to win a prize of up to 25x, further taking the experience to a new level. The immersive title offers the online players a casino setting that enables them to “swipe in and out in open sessions,” explained ESA Gaming.</p>
<p>The release of the new title comes after early last month, the company hired the services of Josefin Uppeke. Joining ESA Gaming, Uppeke was named as the company’s new head of game production. In her new role, she is expected to play a pivotal role amid the ongoing growth and development of ESA Gaming and its products.</p>
<p>Before that, the company expanded further the reach of its product via a deal with betBonanza, a Nigerian operator. This collaboration helped ESA Gaming’s content reach new customers, while at the same time expanding the offering of the Nigerian operator.</p>
