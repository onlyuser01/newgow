    <h1>777 Casino Drive Cherokee Nc 28719 Popular Online Casinos The Linq Hotel Casino Hollywood Casino Tun</h1>

<p>This casino is deceiving me</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I tried to make a withdrawal at this casino, as we all know this process entails account verification.</p>
<p>Everything was fine at first.</p>
<p>I presented all the documents required by the casino.</p>
<p>With the assistance of their online chat service, the process was quick and the agent assured me my account was verified.</p>
<p>That's when the problems began.</p>
<p>Normally, all casinos send an email confirming the account verification is complete.</p>
<p>That was not the case here, but I trusted them nonetheless.</p>
<p>When I tried to make the withdrawal, an error occurred.</p>
<p>A message appeared stating I needed to verify my account.</p>
<p>I contacted the chat service and that's where they started leading me on. They had me perform various tasks such as changing my browser and so on.</p>
<p>Nonsense tasks.</p>
<p>Making deposits was not an issue.</p>
<p>However, when it came to withdrawals, there were suddenly issues with my device.</p>
<p>After repeatedly insisting, they finally told me they were forwarding the issue to their technical department.</p>
<p>It's been 30 hours since then, yet no solution. Every time I contact the chat service, they have the same excuse.</p>
<p>I asked them to send me the account verification confirmation email. After further insistence, they sent me a hastily written email confirming my account verification.</p>
<p>Long story short, my account is not verified.</p>
<p>The documents I uploaded on my profile have not been fully reviewed – one approved and three pending. How can an account be verified with only one approved document?</p>
<p>I asked about this and the agent removed the three pending documents.</p>
<p>My account is not verified, consequently, the system automatically declines my withdrawal –that's expected.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if the casino could verify my account so that I can make my withdrawal.</p>
