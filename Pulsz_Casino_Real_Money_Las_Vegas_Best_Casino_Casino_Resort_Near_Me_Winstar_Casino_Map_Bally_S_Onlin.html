<p>White Hat Studios, one of the fastest-growing iGaming studios in the United States, has another excellent news to report with the company just signing a content alliance with betPARX, a prominent local operator.</p>

<p>The company has been maintaining its preeminence in American iGaming by disrupting the industry through variety. The titles launching with betPARX now include all-time favorites such as Crazy Fishin, Almighty Buffalo Megaways, Ted, and so much more.</p>
<p>There are also a number of new games that will feature the studio’s Jackpot Royale, a progressive jackpot mechanic, that is taking the White Hat Studios-powered experience to the next level.</p>
<p>betPARX has welcomed the news of having a new dedicated partner in the face of White Hat Studios that will now strengthen the company’s library and offer even better experiences for the company’s online casino platform.</p>

<p>He assured that users will be getting high-quality and IP-driven titles that elevate the gameplay and promised that White Hat Studios has a busy product line with new games released every month.
