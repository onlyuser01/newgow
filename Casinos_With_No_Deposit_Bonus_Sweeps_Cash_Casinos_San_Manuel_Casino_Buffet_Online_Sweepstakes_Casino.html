    <h1>Casinos With No Deposit Bonus Sweeps Cash Casinos San Manuel Casino Buffet Online Sweepstakes Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Anto1318,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. First, I’d like to explain to you what the difference is between closing an account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Closing the account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can reopen the account anytime, and the casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances (after cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who’s are addicted/with gambling problems).</p>
<p>From the email you sent to us I can clearly see you only asked the casino to close your account, and there is no mention of self-exclusion, nor gambling addiction. If the casino wasn’t informed about your problem, we, unfortunately, cannot proceed with this case as failed self-exclusion and you are not entitled to any refund.</p>
<p>If there is a message in which you clearly state your gambling problem as a reason for account closure, please forward it to kristina.s@casino.guru, otherwise, I will be forced to reject this complaint.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
