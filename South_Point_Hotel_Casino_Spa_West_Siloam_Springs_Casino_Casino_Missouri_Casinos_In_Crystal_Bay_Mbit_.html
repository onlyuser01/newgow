<p>Swintt, a company focused on delivering cutting-edge gambling products, has released a Christmas spin-off of one of its most popular slots series, Seven Seven. The new game, Seven Seven Xmas, will see the supplier hand out holiday gifts to the players.</p>
<p>Seven Seven Xmas is one of the multiple festive games that slots aficionados can try out this Christmas.</p>

<p>Seven Seven Xmas Rewards Risk Takers</p>
<p>Swintt announced the return of Seven Seven Xmas, the holiday iteration of the company’s beloved Seven Seven series. Just like the mainline games, Seven Seven Xmas will see players collect fruit-themed symbols to win big prizes.</p>
<p>Simple yet engaging, the Christmas slot features fixed paylines whereby players could win prizes of up to 1,000x their bet. To collect a prize, players need to line up three or more matching symbols in adjacent columns. The title’s flagship lucky seven is the highest-paying symbol that allows players to win the biggest prize.</p>
<p>In addition that, the game features red fireball scatter symbols that act independently from the main paylines and will always award a prize if a player manages to collect three or more of them, no matter their actual position.</p>
<p>Risk lovers can leverage Swintt’s signature Risk feature to gamble their wins. After each win players will be allowed to activate the feature and select either the color or the suit of a hidden player card. Guessing the color correctly doubles the winnings while picking the right suit quadruples the prize. Those who want to push their luck can wager their winnings multiple times. They should, however, keep in mind that they would lose their winnings if they guess incorrectly.</p>
<p>The Slot Will Allow Players to Make Exciting Holiday Bets</p>
<p>David Mann, Swintt’s chief executive officer, commented on the new release, praising the Seven Seven series as one of the most iconic lines of games in the company’s entire portfolio. The festive makeover of Seven Seven Xmas seeks to celebrate the holidays while allowing players to make some exciting bets.</p>
<p>Featuring all the classic design elements and mechanics that have made the Seven Seven slots such a huge hit with fans, Seven Seven Xmas is a high-variance game that offers players the chance to unwrap scatter wins and big prizes of up to 1,000x their stake. This coupled with the slot’s fun, wintery aesthetic should ensure that it’s the perfect pre-Christmas release for all Swintt’s partners. David Mann, CEO, Swintt</p>
<p>Speaking of Swintt, the company joined forces with Kindred in September, bringing enhanced iGaming to Europe.</p>
