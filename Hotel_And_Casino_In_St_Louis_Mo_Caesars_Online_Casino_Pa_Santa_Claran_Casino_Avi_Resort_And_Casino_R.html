<p>Gladiator Legends review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Gladiator Legends is themed around the ancient Roman combat sport.</p>
<p>Players will enter an intense world of weapons, wild animals, and blood. With their life on the line, they’ll need to fight hard to make it in the arena.</p>
<p>Gladiator Legends is a good fit for fans of Roman history, the TV series Spartacus, or the Academy Award winning film Gladiator.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack has an ominous tone with tension-inducing notes and trumpets that seem to be a call to battle. The reels spin with a metallic sound that fittingly brings to mind chains.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see bloody swords, axes, hammers, and fierce lions. Other symbols include stone letters that bring to mind ancient latin writing.</p>
<p>Despite the slot’s name, there is a notable absence of Gladiator characters. It would have added depth to the world to see a few of the gladiators themselves appear on the reels.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, a stylized blurry scene is partly visible with spears on hand and bright light ahead. This allows players to imagine how it would feel to be a gladiator about to step into the arena.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a gritty ancient world with a cinematic feel.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Gladiator Legends is a five reel, four row slot with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols.</p>
<p>The VS symbol expands into Duel Reels when it is activated. The Duel Reels each have two Wild Multipliers which represent a gladiator in a duel. The multiplier that survives the duel is applied to the whole reel.</p>
<p>During the bonus features, VS symbols expand every time they land, and depending on the bonus feature, multipliers can be as high as x500 or x1,000.</p>
<p>The Champions of the Arena special feature is triggered when players land 3 Arena symbols and begins with 3 free spins. Whenever players land a VS symbol, the number of free spins resets to 3.</p>
<p>Throughout the Champions of the Arena feature, there are Reel Multipliers above each reel. Multiplier Coin symbols may also appear to multiplier the Reel Multiplier.</p>
<p>The Unleash the Beast special feature is triggered when players land 3 Beast symbols and begins with 3 free spins. The number of free spins resets whenever players land a VS symbol.</p>
<p>During the Unleash the Beast feature, Reel Multipliers appear above reels 1, 2, 4, and 5, and they accumulate value from Duel Multiplier symbols. The third reel is locked initially and can be unlocked by a VS symbol landing at least once on reels 1, 2, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>Once unlocked, the third reel has a special Beast Duel with a multiplier that can multiply each of the other reel’s multipliers.</p>
<p>Players can buy directly into the Bonus if they wish by selecting the Buy Bonus option.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.31%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>

<p>With a respectable RTP and enticing volatility, Gladiator Legends is a great pick for mathematically minded players.</p>
<p>The ample bonus features add further interest to this engaging slot.</p>
