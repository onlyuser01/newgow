<p>In the second release for the Yggdrasil’s YG Masters’ program, True Lab debuts Christmas Tree, a holiday slot to lighten up your mood this Christmas.</p>
<p>True Lab Debuts Second YG Masters Game with Christmas Tree Slot</p>
<p>Yggdrasil adds to the festive mood with a special twist in Christmas Tree, a game developed as part of the game publisher’s YG Masters program and in collaboration with True Lab, an affiliated partner studio of the YG Masters experience.</p>
<p>Christmas Tree is an ambitious project setting out to boost your holiday mood and bring you a palatable Christmassy experience in the form of gripping gameplay, holiday carols, A-grade visuals, and a second release for the team at True Lab under their partnership with YG Masters and Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>The tree is up! Let's foster that Holiday spirit with the aptly named YG Master game, Christmas Tree from TrueLab. The game is built around cluster wins and a happy snowman throwing Wilds on the tree.</p>
<p>Read the press release: https://t.co/Q3l6nW8r6Y pic.twitter.com/nG6blXyxzW — Yggdrasil Gaming (@YggdrasilGaming) December 7, 2020</p>
<p>The company, which is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), has focused on developing leading iGaming products based on HTML5, and now tapping into the powerful GATI technology by Yggdrasil to bring innovation to slot gameplay and facilitate brand integration.</p>
<p>True Lab has sought a deeper integration with the best holiday of the year by creating a unique gameplay grid against a backdrop of a Christmas tree, ornaments, winking lights, and the Jolly Old man making a well-timed appearance.</p>
<p>Christmas Tree Slot: Features and Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is adequately loaded with features to keep your spirits high during the holiday, with five or more identical symbol landing on a diagonal cluster forming a successful payout.</p>
<p>Once a winning combination is formed, the symbols will empty out, allowing for a ‘cascade’ to occur. If you get three in a row, players will get a Christmas Present, which is another feature of the slot experience brought to you by the masterminds at True Lab.</p>
<p>Your present all wrapped up, you stand to benefit from a 30x multiplier once the ribbon comes off. Other little cadeaux include free spins or between five and 1,000 bets. There is a snowman who is more than happy to project a snowball your way and turn the occasional symbol into a Wild to turn a near-miss into a bull’s eye.</p>
<p>During ‘Blizzard’ players need not seek shelter, because your reels can be scrambled up again for some additional winning potential.</p>
<p>A Christmas Slot Compliant with Regulators</p>
<p>Apart from the great gamification features, the benefits of YG Masters extend to the legal aspects of releasing new games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the proprietor GATI technology, property of Yggdrasil, B2B partners may use the Game Adaptation Tools &amp; Interface to roll out a slot that is automatically configured for every targeted market, saving operators all the hassle of adjusting the game for their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Christmas Tree is a follow-up game from Victoria Wild, another YG Masters torchbearer, with more games planned down the pipeline. Welcoming this development, Yggdrasil, Head of Partner Programs, Stuart McCarthy said that with Christmas upon the iGaming world, True Lab’s second title under the YG Masters’ IP was a great opportunity to enjoy a fun-filled and captivating gameplay.</p>
<p>He expressed confidence that players will have no trouble appreciating the game in its entirety and have a good time playing. True Lab’s Chief Business Development Officer Vasily Polynov joined McCarthy in praising the GATI technology and the possibilities it opened up for operators and businesses.</p>
<p>“In Christmas Tree, our developers have come up with such an innovative and immersive game that’s so enjoyable to play. It’s certainly going to be a happy Christmas for slot fans,” Polynov added, affirming that it has been an exciting year for True Lab, with more to follow.</p>
