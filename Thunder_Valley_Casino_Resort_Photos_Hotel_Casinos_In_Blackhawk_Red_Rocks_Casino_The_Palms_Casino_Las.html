    <h1>Thunder Valley Casino Resort Photos Hotel Casinos In Blackhawk Red Rocks Casino The Palms Casino Las</h1>

<p>Dear Xotin36,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the general terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>„RESPONSIBLE GAMING</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>For customers who want to set limits on their gambling, we offer a voluntary self-exclusion service, which allows you to close your account or restrict your gambling activities for one of the following periods: 1 month, 6 months, 1 year or 10 years. Once your account has been self-excluded, it will be closed until the selected time period has elapsed. Once the self-exclusion period has ended, you will be able to recommence your use of any Services by contacting Customer Support.</p>
<p>You can request that the restrictions are removed from your account before the self-exclusion period has ended; however, the final decision rests with the Company.</p>
<p>During the self-exclusion period you must not attempt to open a new Account and you must accept that the Company shall have no financial liability and shall not be held otherwise accountable if you continue gambling or using a new Account with the Service under a different name or address."</p>
<p>Is support@casino-z.com or security@casino-z.com the email address to which your requests have been sent?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
