<p>Gambling harm is an inseparable part of gambling activities. Regardless if engaging in online or retail gambling, there are users who become addicted and ultimately experience the negative impact of gambling harm. On the other hand, there are people affected by other people’s gambling, such as a family member or a friend. A recent report released by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe), reaffirms the importance of adequate measures to mitigate gambling harm by probing into universal measures.</p>
<p>Restricting Gambling Advertising</p>
<p>Published on Monday, the research examines the effectiveness of different approaches toward limiting gambling harm and reducing the negative impact of gambling in Scotland. Ultimately, the new white paper points to four measures that are likely to reduce the risks associated with gambling and the harm itself.</p>
<p>SPICe’s latest report outlines that one of the measures that seeks to limit gambling harm is restricting advertising, promotion, and sponsorships for gambling operators. The report outlined that currently, there are voluntary measures taken by the gambling industry, but overall, there are “few mandatory or legal restrictions on gambling advertising in Britain.”</p>
<p>Gambling advertising covers multiple channels, including TV, online and retail locations, the report pointed out. What’s more, sports teams also contribute in terms of advertising via sponsorship promotions, which, according to the report impacts vulnerable groups such as people affected by problem gambling or even children.</p>
<p>It is likely that this can be improved by the review of the Gambling Act which for the moment remains at a constant “to-be-released soon” state. Focusing on the protection of the users, the report said that the Scottish Women’s football team has selected not to team up with gambling companies or alcohol producers.</p>
<p>Restrictions and School Education May Curb Gambling Harm</p>
<p>Another important measure outlined in the recent report involves the restriction of access to gambling. This applies especially to vulnerable groups such as children. At the same time, the reports points out that other restrictions may help reduce problem gambling such as changes to the working hours of retail outlets.</p>
<p>Still, the white paper said that with the 24/7 availability of online gambling, such restrictions may have a limited effect. Considering the impact of gambling harm on young adults, an alternative is to raise the age, the report says, but acknowledges that there’s little evidence to support how effective such an approach may be.</p>
<p>“Given the potential harm to young adults, the age at which people can gamble could also be increased, though evidence for the potential effectiveness of this approach is lacking,“ explains the recent report</p>
<p>An important measure that can have a positive impact and reduce gambling harm, according to the report are public information campaigns. It said that such campaigns can help with the treatment and support, but they need to be developed in a way to ensure efficiency. Finally, another measure that can help tackle gambling harm in Scotland is school education, the report suggests. Different education campaigns about the risks of gambling may help reduce gambling harm but evidence of their effectiveness is yet to be gathered.</p>
