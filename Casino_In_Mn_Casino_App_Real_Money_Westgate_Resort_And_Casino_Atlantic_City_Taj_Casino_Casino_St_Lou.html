<p>The Tennessee Titans vs. Miami Dolphins is one of the two Monday Night Football games</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins are 9-3 in the 2023 season, meaning that they have a very good chance to win the No. 1 seed in the American Football Conference (AFC) at the end of the regular season.</p>
<p>The bad news is that they’ve got a couple of tough matches to play in the remainder of the season. The good news is that the Week 14 MNF game against the Tennessee Titans isn’t one of them.</p>
<p>The Titans are 4-8 overall in 2023, with no chance of winning the division and a tiny chance of getting a wild card entry to the postseason. For that to happen, they’d need to win (at least) three of their remaining five games.</p>

<p>Is It All Over for the Tennessee Titans?</p>
<p>The Titans are sitting at the bottom of the AFC South, and with a 4-8 record, their chance of making the playoffs is minimal. They’d need to win most of the games in the remainder of the 2023 season, but even that wouldn’t be enough if their rivals didn’t fail miserably.</p>
<p>Winning so many games doesn’t seem realistic for several reasons. First of all, they’re in horrible form with one win in their last five games. Secondly, they’ve got some serious problems with injuries.</p>
<p>Some notable Titans’ injuries: DT Jeffery Simmons is expected to miss “a couple weeks” due to a knee injury, per Mike Vrabel. https://t.co/SzQe4rXrpl — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 4, 2023</p>
<p>Their punter Ryan Stonehouse is out for the rest of the season, and the same could be the case with defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons.</p>
<p>On top of everything, running back Derrick Henry suffered a concussion last weekend, but should be ready to play in Week 14, albeit probably not at his 100%.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins to Challenge the No. 1 Seed in the AFC</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins are playing great in 2023, although many NFL pundits don’t see them as Super Bowl material. The reason is that they haven’t done great against tough opponents.</p>
<p>Their three losses happened to teams that are in the Lombardi Trophy conversation – Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, and Buffalo Bills.</p>
<p>However, the Dolphins have been phenomenal against teams with a negative record in 2023. In fact, we saw them obliterate a couple of underdogs this season, most notably, the Denver Broncos (who were 0-2 at the time). They destroyed them 70-20.</p>
<p>More recently, the Dolphins destroyed the Washington Commanders 45-15 and the New York Jets 34-13, each time on the road. In their most recent game in Miami Gardens, they beat the Las Vegas Raiders 20-13.</p>
<p>Tennessee Titans vs. Miami Dolphins Prediction</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins covered the spread in each of their last two games. However, the last time they played at home, they didn’t do it. They beat the Raiders by seven points, but the spread was set to 14 points.</p>
<p>It’s similar when it comes to the Week 14 Monday Night Football game, in which the home team is seen as a -13.5 favorite. This time, however, we think they’re going to do it.</p>
<p>Pick: Miami Dolphins -13.5 (-110)</p>
