<p>Wisconsin sports bettors may soon have yet another alternative as a third Indian tribe prepares to launch its offerings. This is thanks to Governor Tony Evers who signed a gaming compact amendment that will allow the Forest County Potawatomi to launch their own sports betting business.</p>
<p>Potawatomi Sports Betting on the Way</p>
<p>Evers explained that the gaming compact amendment envisions to greenlight the Potawatomi for offering event betting on sports and non-sports disciplines. It wasn’t elaborated exactly what kind of non-sports event betting the amendment intends to permit. The amendment will also allow the Tribe to offer sports betting on lands adjacent to its casinos in Menominee Valley and Forest County. It will, moreover, extend the Potawatomi’s pre-existing gaming compact to 2061.</p>
<p>The amendment will now be presented to the US Department of Interior. The latter will have 45 days to review it and decide whether to approve it or not. If the department does not make a decision within that period, the amendment will be considered approved, as long as it corresponds to the standards of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.</p>
<p>The inking of the compact amendment came after a period of negotiations between the State and the Tribe. If it gets greenlit by the federals, the Potawatomi, who own Wisconsin’s largest casino, may become the next local sports betting leader.</p>
<p>Evers Is Sure the Amendment Will Benefit the State</p>
<p>Governor Evers spoke on his decision and mentioned that he is looking forward to expanding tribal sports betting. He vowed to work together with the Potawatomi for the years to come. Evers added that he is convinced that allowing the Potawatomi to launch its sports betting business will be a lucrative move that will benefit both the Tribe and the whole of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Ned Daniels Junior, the chairman of the Potawatomi, signed the amendment alongside Evers. He thanked Evers for being so collaborative throughout the whole process:</p>
<p>“We appreciate Governor Evers and his Administration working with us in a government-to-government manner to provide our Tribe the tools needed to compete in the marketplace and giving us the business certainty to continue our investments in Milwaukee and throughout the state.” Potawatomi chairman Ned Daniels Junior</p>
<p>The Potawatomi owns the biggest gambling venue in the state, namely the Potawatomi Casino and Hotel in Milwaukee. The Tribe has another venue in Wabeno called the Potawatomi Carter Casino Hotel. Should the amendment be approved by the US federals, the Potawatomi will become the third tribal nation to offer sports betting in the state, the other two being the Oneida Nation and the St. Croix Chippewa Indians.</p>
