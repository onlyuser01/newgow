<p>Gaming industry technology supplier Scientific Games announced today a 5-year extension to its deal with the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation, to continue to provide the lottery with a number of products and services.</p>
<p>Successful Partnership Set to Continue</p>
<p>The Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation will continue to drive funding for education in the state via the high-performance instant lottery games Scientific Games supplies under the world-leading Scientific Games Enhanced Partnership (SGEP) program, covering areas such as game design and game planning services, analytics &amp; trading insights, advanced logistics, warehousing, distribution, and retail.</p>
<p>“.. Through our partnership with Scientific Games, we have the data and technology needed to effectively and efficiently design games, distribute them to our retailers around the state, and ultimately deliver trusted products to our players and generate more dollars for educational programs benefitting Tennessee students.” Rebecca Paul Hargrove, President &amp; CEO, Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation</p>
<p>Hargrove, who is currently serving her second term as President of the World Lottery Association and was a President of the North American State &amp; Provincial Lotteries in the past, saw the launch of the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation and is instrumental for the success that the lottery company achieves on a regular basis.</p>
<p>“Scientific Games’ longtime collaboration with the Tennessee Lottery’s team has delivered outstanding results and serves as a model for many U.S. lotteries.” John Schulz, SVP, Lottery Instant Products, Scientific Games</p>
<p>Since its instant games partnership with Scientific Games began in 2004, the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation has been consistently ranking among the Top 10 lotteries in terms of performance worldwide.</p>
<p>Led by former director of the lotteries in Illinois, Florida and Georgia Hargrove, instant products for the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation brought in more than $1.5 billion in retail sales in the fiscal 2020, smashing previous records in the process.</p>
<p>“We continue to innovate new games and refine our SGEP program and technology to drive their success, and we get better every year together.” John Schulz, SVP, Lottery Instant Products, Scientific Games</p>
<p>History of Being the First in Instant Games</p>
<p>The gaming and lottery technology provider has a history of being the first: it launched back in 1974 as the world’s first secure retail instant game, while in 2014, Scientific Games launched the first digital instant game in the US.</p>
<p>Since 2014, Scientific Games established itself as a top lottery provider, supplying interactive games, mobile apps, loyalty programs for players, as well as other interactive products and services for lottery operators, including every North American lottery, while its client portfolio on a global scale includes more than 150 lottery companies.</p>
<p>In January, Scientific Games signed a 1-year extension deal for instant and hybrid lottery games with Loto-Quebec.</p>
