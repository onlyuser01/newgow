    <h1>Elk Valley Casino New Jersey Online Casinos Rainbow Hotel Casino Casino Coconut Creek Seminole Casin</h1>

<p>The verification process started on 26.07.2023. I uploaded a screenshot of the passport photo, address document and the money I deposited. On 27.07.2023, I received an e-mail that my account was verified. I requested a withdrawal one day, then I received an email with the request "- a selfie in front of the house, so that its number and your residence address could be viewable".</p>
<p>I sent the requested selfie on 01.08.2023. 1 hour later, when I tried to log in to my account, I got a warning that your account was deactivated. I connected to the live chat and asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. unfortunately, your documents were suspected as not legitimate and therefore, your account was permanently blocked. I am sorry to say that but it cannot be unblocked."</p>
<p>I got your answer. I got an email today</p>
<p>"Your photo will be uploaded from our side Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. Your account will be verified soon!"</p>
<p>So I reconnected to the live chat and asked what that meant.</p>
<p>"Thank you for holding. Seyit! you got a confirmation that the document was passed to security tear since you had difficulties uploading it in your personal profile, though after the securmy team checked on it and made a final decision the outcome, unfortunately, remains the same and decision won't be reviewed. "</p>
<p>I asked if this decision was made before checking the selfie I posted.</p>
<p>"According to the notes left by security team they reviewed the document and advised the decision regarding your account remains the same so they took it based on the documents you uploaded previously, though they still considered the another document you sent and confirmed on their decision."</p>
<p>I got this response. I was just told that it was suspected that the documents were not legitimate. The deposit I had made on 25/07/2023 the money would probably have been credited to my casino account. I requested a refund when my account was closed and they said they would not refund it.</p>
