<p>Lottomatica is proud to be the first company in the world to offer highlights and overlays for tennis live streams</p>
<p>Stats Perform announced that it has agreed to supply Italy’s leading sportsbook, Lottomatica, with a selection of tennis solutions. Thanks to the deal, Lottomatica’s Goldbet and Better brand will be able to benefit from Instant Highlights and Smart Stats Overlays.</p>
<p>Tennis is the latest sport to be covered by these solutions, just as announced by Stats Perform earlier this year. As a result, Lottomatica will become the first operator in Italy to offer the Instant Highlight and Smart Stats Overlays for tennis.</p>
<p>The Instant Highlights solution allows bettors to re-watch important game events while a game is still in play. The solution is also available for football, covering a rich selection of events and leagues, such as Ligue 1, La Liga and 60+ football leagues, as well as WTA, Wimbledon and the Australian Open in terms of tennis competitions.</p>
<p>Smart Stats Overlays, on the other hand, will provide Goldbet and Better players with real-time Opta betting stats on-screen. That solution is also available for football and tennis live streams, providing a plethora of important information to sports bettors.</p>
<p>Both solutions are available to operators through Stat Perform’s plug-and-play Content Player Pro, or an easy-to-use API for custom product development.</p>
<p>Lottomatica Is Pleased to Be Ahead of Its Competitors</p>
<p>Andrew Ashenden, Stats Perform’s chief betting officer, commented on the agreement, saying that Instant Highlights and Smart Stats Overlays deliver what players want, helping operators attract and retain customers. He added that his team is glad to join forces with Lottomatica, which is just about passionate about sports as Stats Perform.</p>
<p>Vincenzo Zeppillo, Stats Perform’s director of betting for Southern Europe, also shared his thoughts. He noted that he is glad that Lottomatica will pioneer the solutions’ new tennis variant.</p>
<p>We’re delighted to help Lottomatica be the first to bring such a high level of sports entertainment to their tennis customers and confident Instant Highlights and Smart Stats Overlays will be a huge success, as they are for football. Vincenzo Zeppillo, director of betting Southern Europe, Stats Perform</p>
<p>Paolo Manzo, sportsbook director betting &amp; digital Italy at Lottomatica, said that Stats Perform’s solutions will help his team deliver next-gen live streaming experiences to GoldBet and Better players.</p>
<p>We focus relentlessly on enhancing the customer experience and Instant Highlights and Smart Stats Overlays from Stats Perform are powerful tools helping us make every live sports stream more entertaining and more valuable for our customers. Paolo Manzo, sportsbook director betting &amp; digital Italy, Lottomatica</p>
<p>Manzo concluded that Lottomatica is proud to be the first company in the world to offer highlights and overlays for tennis live streams.</p>
