<p>Leading iGaming and sports betting operator based in New Jersey BetMGM has announced it will organize the first-ever BetMGM Poker Championship at the ARIA Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. The No-Limit Hold’em tournament with a $3,500 buy-in and a guaranteed prize set at $1 million will take off on June 23 with a finishing date set on June 26. The tournament will be incorporated into the much-anticipated 2022 ARIA Poker Classic.</p>
<p>Daily Qualifiers and Weekly Satellites</p>
<p>BetMGM Poker will give out prize packages to a minimum of 15 players from each of the 15 live poker markets currently open in the country. Each package will consist of a buy-in for the No-Limit Hold’em championship and will be distributed at the end of daily qualifiers as well as weekly satellites. Winners will also enjoy free accommodation for five nights at the ARIA resort and they will have all their travel expenses taken care of as part of the same package.</p>
<p>On June 25, players will be given the chance to buy their way into the BetMGM Poker Mystery Bounty for $600. This will be the first modern live poker knockout tournament ever to be held at the ARIA Resort &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Perfect Timing for the Inaugural BetMGM Poker Championship in Las Vegas</p>
<p>According to BetMGM’s director of poker Luke Staudenmaier, the event will take place “during one of the most exciting times of the poker season”. Staudenmaier also called ARIA a “legendary poker brand” and expressed the company’s excitement to have their Championship incorporated into the 2022 Poker Classic.</p>
<p>BetMGM expects its close ties with MGM Resorts’ state-of-the-art land and online gaming and sports betting venues spread all across the country to bring it more access to similar events in the future. The company also plans on improving its relationship with its current online and offline poker players, while continuing to enter new markets.</p>
<p>Responsible Gaming, a Top Priority for BetMGM</p>
<p>The operator keeps responsible gaming a top priority through a number of actions including the dedicated MGM Resorts and BetMGM campaign that attracted the support of the National Council on Problem Gambling. The company’s valuable responsible gaming resources and efforts include GameSense, a program created and licensed by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation. The program is available through MGM Resorts and provides helpful tools through BetMGM’s both desktop and mobile platforms.</p>
<p>In March, BetMGM was also actively involved in the Problem Gambling Awareness Month. The company plans to keep its investments running in 2022, eventually reaching and going over a projected 53% net revenue growth.</p>
<p>BetMGM is MGM Resort’s 50/50 venture and owns a number of online gaming and sports betting brands such as BetMGM, Party Casino, Party Poker, and Borgata Casino. MGM Resorts owns 32 international hotel and gaming destinations and it is currently seeking to expand on the Asian continent through an integrated resort in Japan. The company is committed to having a bigger impact into the lives of its employees and guests while building a more sustainable future.</p>
