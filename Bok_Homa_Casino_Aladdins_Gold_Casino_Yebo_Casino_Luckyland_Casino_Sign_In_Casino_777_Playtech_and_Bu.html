<p>The extension will last until 2031 and focuses on the integration of Playtech’s seamless wallet technology and Omni-channel customer experience</p>
<p>Leading gambling industry technology provider Playtech and Buzz Bingo, one of the UK’s top Bingo operators, have extended their software License and Services Agreement until 2031.

This integration creates a centralized user hub for all channels like Bingo, Casino, Live Dealer, POP, Cashier, and Native apps.</p>
<p>Such a unified approach ensures players enjoy a cohesive gaming journey across multiple touchpoints, aiding player engagement and retention. Buzz Bingo CEO Dominic Mansour was excited regarding the new possibilities, noting that Playtech’s extensive suite of industry-leading products would significantly bolster the operator’s leading position in the UK bingo sector.</p>
<p>We’re delighted to extend our agreement and continue working closely to deliver exceptional gaming experiences to our players wherever they choose to play. Dominic Mansour, CEO, Buzz Bingo</p>
<p>This long-term extension solidifies Buzz Bingo’s position as a leading strategic partner for Playtech in the UK market. The operator has experienced rapid growth since its 2018 launch, rising as one of the top-performing UK online bingo brands. Playtech’s newest offerings will help Buzz Bingo provide a comprehensive and immersive gaming experience to its growing community of online players.</p>
<p>Playtech Remains on the Cutting-Edge</p>
<p>Extending the partnership with Buzz Bingo highlights Playtech’s successful business strategy, focusing on providing unparalleled quality to its partners. Company COO Shimon Akad expressed optimism regarding the new deal, noting it perfectly aligned with Playtech’s commitment to maintain its leadership position through cutting-edge technology and best-in-class products.</p>
<p>We are proud to support Buzz Bingo’s rapid growth in the online space and look forward to continuing our successful collaboration for many years to come. Shimon Akad, Playtech COO</p>
<p>Playtech has gained considerable momentum in 2023, backed by impressive financial results across most metrics. The company has expertly leveraged its leadership position to foster further growth and invest in new and improved solutions. A recent collaboration with digital ID verification services and software provider IDVerse significantly bolstered onboarding and ID verification capabilities for all Playtech partners, adding to the company’s value offering.</p>
<p>A shared focus on innovation, player-centric offerings, and responsible operations perfectly positioned Playtech and Buzz Bingo to shape a bright and prosperous future for Omni-channel gaming in the UK.
