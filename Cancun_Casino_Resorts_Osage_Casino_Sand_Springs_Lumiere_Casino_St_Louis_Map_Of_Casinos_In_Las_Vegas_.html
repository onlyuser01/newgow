<p>Leading supplier of Live Casino games Evolution Gaming has teamed up with FanDuel Group and will roll out its products on the latter’s online casinos in the United States.</p>
<p>FanDuel Online Casino to Now Host Evolution Games in the US</p>
<p>Evolution Live Casino is continuing its expansion push across the United States with the help of FanDuel Group. A leading provider of Live Casino solutions, Evolution is one of the brands tipped to dominate the vertical in the newly-fledged iGaming market across the United States.</p>
<p>Evolution has already opened a studio in New Jersey, and recently scaled up capacity to double of what it started with in the Garden State. Meanwhile, the company has already teamed up with DraftKings and Rush Street Interact in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Thanks to the alliance between Evolution and FanDuel, the former will be able to debut its selection of live games onto FanDuel online casino operations. The partnership focuses on the Keystone State first, but it will expand to New Jersey.</p>
<p>FanDuel will feature games from both Evolution and Ezugi, a formerly rival Live Casino developer which was bought out by Evolution in January 2019.</p>
<p>Strong Growth in the US Continues for Both Companies</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, FanDuel Group general manager Jesse Chemtob has confirmed that Live Casino games will remain a key driver of interest in the US market.</p>
<p>“We’re really excited to offer our loyal customers more Live Casino games. We see Live Casino as a key driver for continued online casino market growth in the US and FanDuel will now have access to Evolution’s entire Live Casino portfolio.”</p>
<p>He was joined by his colleague, Evolution Chief Commercial Officer Johan Nordstrom, who also welcomed the opportunity.</p>
<p>Building on a successful partnership with Flutter Entertainment’s Betfair and Paddy Power, Evolution was now able to add another Flutter brand to its portfolio of partners, with FanDuel giving it a fresh push in the highly-contested US market.</p>
<p>Evolution has been working actively on securing a bigger market share. The company has been particularly active in Colombia, becoming the first full-scale live vendor to launch there.</p>
<p>The company reported great results in Q3 and confirmed that growth has been stable throughout the quarter. Evolution has been diversifying its portfolio of partners and previously teamed up with William Hill for a US launch.</p>
