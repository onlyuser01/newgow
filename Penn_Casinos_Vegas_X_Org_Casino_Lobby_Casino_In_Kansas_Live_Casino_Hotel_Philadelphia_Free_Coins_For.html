<p>The supplier has been sponsoring the team for over a decade</p>
<p>Play’n GO, a Swedish-based casino entertainment provider, has unveiled a continuation of its partnership with the Växjö Lakers, a Swedish professional ice hockey club from Växjö. The casino provider has been serving as the title sponsor of the team for over a decade now.</p>
<p>Because of its Växjö roots, Play’n GO is firmly committed to supporting the local team. Having emerged victorious last season, the Växjö Lakers now boast a whopping four champion titles.</p>
<p>Under the renewed sponsorship, Play’n GO’s logo will continue to feature at the Lakers’ games. Last season, the gaming supplier’s logo appeared on the Växjö Lakers’ helmets. In addition, the gaming company’s logo appeared all over the Vida Arena and across a private Play’n GO lounge with customized interior.</p>
<p>In addition, Play’n GO’s logo was visible on the Lakers’ jerseys and helmets during European champions league play.</p>
<p>Bringing Together Two Great Champions</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s chief executive officer, Johan Tornqvist, commented on the renewed sponsorship agreement, saying that it brings together two great champions – Play’n GO and the Växjö Lakers. Tornqvist added that his team is thrilled to continue supporting its local team.</p>
<p>As the puck is just about to drop on a new season everyone at Play’n GO wishes the team the very best of luck. We’ll be watching intently and cheering on our Lakers throughout the campaign. Johan Tornqvist, CEO, Play’n GO</p>
<p>Johan Markusson, Växjö Lakers’ chief executive officer, also released a statement on the matter, welcoming Play’n GO as the Laker’s title sponsor for another season. He thanked the casino supplier for its unwavering support and said that such deals are vital to the club and Swedish hockey as a whole.</p>
<p>They [sponsorship agreements] allow us to be able to compete at the highest possible levels in Sweden and Europe, as well as maintain an inclusive, community focused club that supports hockey for all ages. Johan Markusson, CEO, Växjö Lakers</p>
<p>Markusson concluded that his team’s partnership with Play’n GO is a really “creative” one and said that he is looking forward to the new season.</p>
<p>In other news, Play’n GO just expanded its reach in the United States as it agreed to supply content to BetMGM in West Virginia.</p>
