<p>Google allows more gambling ads to appear online</p>
<p>Specific gambling assistance information guidelines necessary</p>
<p>Local regulation could conflict with Google advertising policies</p>
<p>Search engine and Internet services giant Google has said that it would allow gambling companies in several states in the U.S. and countries around the world to push more gambling ads provided that they offered gambling assistance information as they did.</p>
<p>Google Expands Advertising Policies for Betting and Gambling</p>
<p>Google has revealed plans to increase the online ads coverage of sports betting and casinos, opening the sluice gates for such marketing tools in more states across the United States. Up until now, the world’s largest Internet search engine only allowed ads to be displayed in New Jersey, Nevada and West Virginia.</p>
<p>However, moving forward, states where sports betting is legal, should all be able to advertise more aggressively and without breaking advertorial policies. Yet only specific states were added in the latest update. The new states to join include Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Google advised advertisers interested in pushing more gambling-related content to inform themselves by referring to the policy page:</p>
<p>Advertisers who wish to promote online gambling content in these regions can find more information and apply for certification after the update on the updated policy page.</p>
<p>Commenting on the ‘beta test’ that launched in New Jersey in June, the company explained that advertisers will need to step up their efforts in assisting customers who may be at risk or exhibit reckless gambling behaviour.</p>
<p>Specifically, companies pushing gambling products would need to offer gambling assistance and display contact information to problem gambling bodies, such as the Council on Compulsive Gambling in both New Jersey and Nevada.</p>
<p>Leveraging Gambling Ads</p>
<p>Operators who gain approval will be able to benefit from a number of advertorial tools at their disposal. Any approved affiliate or marketing company would be able to then use Google Ads, Google Display Network, YouTube or AdMob to get the message to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Today’s changes in policy reflect a more tentative move dating back to 2017 when Google first allowed real money apps in the Google Play store.</p>
<p>Local regulations have clashed with Google guidelines on at least one occasion in Kenya. As per the latest Google Policy Update, dating to October 2019 several countries have been allowed to be a little more aggressive about how they advertise sports and casinos. They include:</p>
<p>Kenya</p>
<p>Nigeria</p>
<p>Colombia</p>
<p>However, all operators to do so must hold an official license from the respective regulatory body in the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kenya has been trying to suspend all social media advertising of any gambling products.</p>
<p>While Google’s approval means a lot to companies and it opens ample opportunity to expand advertising efforts, local legislation plays a part. On one occasion, Casumo had to retract a gambling ad that appeared to people when they tried to find ways on Google to stop themselves from gambling.</p>
<p>The ad was attacked by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), a UK regulator which has been keeping the Internet clean of misleading advertisement. Before that, ASA also targeted other brands recently, including 32Red, William Hill and Bet365.</p>
