<p>The fast-growing business-to-business aggregator platform and content provider, REEVO, announced a new partnership, allowing it to further expand its portfolio of content. Last week, the company confirmed it joined forces with Barbara Bang, the leading iGaming content developer, offering games that stand out with engaging mechanics, unique themes and thrilling features.</p>
<p>Thanks to the freshly minted content agreement, Barbara Bang agreed to supply its innovative games for REEVO. As a result, partners of the leading aggregator will be able to access content from Barbara Bang. This will be achieved via an integration of the iGaming developer's games into REEVO's leading aggregation platform that grants instant access to its portfolio of partners.</p>
<p>Ahikam Raviv, Barbara Bang's Head of Partnerships and Business Development, shared his excitement about the new collaboration in a statement. "I am thrilled about this exciting new collaboration as we kickstart our journey alongside the formidable team at REEVO," he said. Additionally, Raviv predicted that the new content agreement, powered by innovation, will deliver benefits for the two companies.</p>
<p>He added: "Our shared dedication to excellence and creativity will undoubtedly pave the way for a remarkable synergy, propelling us to remarkable heights of achievement." Finally, Raviv said that Barbara Bang is looking forward to the success the new deal will bring.</p>
<p>Currently, Barbara Bang has a strong presence within the online gambling sector. The company is committed to delivering unique and thrilling games by combining engaging themes, innovative features and ideas. This commitment complements REEVO's goal to deliver unrivaled entertainment for its growing list of partners, which is why the new collaboration is a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO's Head of Sales, explained that the company is delighted to sign the new agreement with Barbara Bang. Finally, she pointed out: "Their commitment to data-driven content development, combined with an acute focus on even the smallest player-centric details, perfectly aligns with REEVO’s philosophy of delivering tailor-made, captivating experiences that deeply resonate with our partners’ audiences."</p>
<p>Recently, REEVO signed another important deal by teaming up with RubyPlay. Similarly to the most recent agreement, that deal saw the aggregator gain access to unique games from RubyPlay, allowing the company to expand the reach of its content while at the same time bringing new titles for its partners.</p>
<p>REEVO's market-leading aggregation platform continues to grow and by now offers more than 8,000 games from some of the most popular providers of slot, table, crash and live dealer games in the world. The company has already joined forces with more than 70 iGaming providers, a list that continues to grow constantly.</p>
