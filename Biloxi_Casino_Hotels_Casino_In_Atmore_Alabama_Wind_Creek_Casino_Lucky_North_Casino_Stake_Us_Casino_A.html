<p>Asian American Entertainment Sets $7.5B Baseline in Las Vegas Sands Damages Claim</p>

<p>Asian American Entertainment Corp. (AAEC) wants no less than US$7.5 billion in damages from its one-time partner in Macau, Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS). That’s according to the company’s lawyer, Jorge Menezes, who delivered closing arguments Friday in the long-running breach-of-contract case, as reported by GGRAsia.</p>

<p>At least AAEC is willing to budge a little from the US$12 billion it claimed it was entitled to in its original complaint.</p>
<p>But lawyers for Las Vegas Sands are expected to deny the Las Vegas-based operator has any obligation to AAEC at all when they present their closing arguments Wednesday in Macau’s Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>AAEC Jilted</p>
<p>The dispute stems from the breakdown of a relationship between the two parties 20 years ago. LVS partnered with AAEC, led by Taiwanese businessman Marshall Hao when it was looking to enter Macau in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>In 2001, the two companies submitted a joint bid for a casino license shortly after Macau chose to liberalize its previously monopolistic gaming market.</p>
<p>But LVS dumped AAEC and later submitted a revised bid with Galaxy Entertainment Group, which had already been granted a license. In 2002, Macau’s government allowed LVS to become a sub-licensee of Galaxy.</p>
<p>Soon, LVS was the biggest player in what was fast becoming the world’s biggest gambling hub. Its Macau operations – first the Sands Macao, then the Venetian Macao – enabled it to become the richest casino operator in the world. Since then, it has added two more ambitious resorts to the mix, the Parisian Macao and the Londoner Macao.</p>
<p>AAEC claims that without its early guidance, LVS would have struggled to negotiate the complex licensing process and cultural nuances in Macau.</p>
<p>Billions Left Behind</p>
<p>Hao says he would have invested as much or more than LVS into the joint venture had it been allowed to proceed. The initial claim of $12 billion was based on “lost earnings,” representing 70 percent of LVS profits in Macau from 2004 to 2022, the date the license will expire.</p>
<p>On Friday, Menezes said the US$7.5 billion baseline figure was “based on reasons of fairness and discretion.”</p>
<p>LVS has disputed any liability and said the figures AAEC claims are based on a misreading of financial statements submitted to Macau’s gaming regulator. The company said it has plowed $15 billion of its earnings back into the construction and development of new resorts in the gambling hub.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Macau regulators who oversaw the licensing process have testified that LVS was seen as a highly desirable applicant. They said its experience as a Las Vegas operator most likely outweighed any contribution that might have been made from its local licensing partners.</p>
