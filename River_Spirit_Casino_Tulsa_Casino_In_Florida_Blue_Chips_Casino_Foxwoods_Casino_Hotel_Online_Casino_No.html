    <h1>River Spirit Casino Tulsa Casino In Florida Blue Chips Casino Foxwoods Casino Hotel Online Casino No</h1>

<p>Dear Axel,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.fastpay-casino.com/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>"Please note that if you requested a withdrawal, but the sum of bets made since last deposit does not exceed three (3) times for slots (10 times for live or table games) the size of the latest deposit, such a withdrawal will be charged with a 10% fee, which should be confirmed by a user in the live chat (or via email support@help-fastpay-casino.com). The decision about whether to approve the withdrawal with fee or not is at the sole discretion of FASTPAY Casino’s management team. Please bear in mind that low risk roulette play where the player betting equal stakes for both black/red or even/odd covering 25 or more out of 37 numbers on the table doesn’t count towards meeting wagering requirements."</p>
<p>It is not unusual for a casino to have this rule. Some casinos require deposit wagering 1x, some 3x or 5x, but you can find casinos with even higher wagering requirements for real money.</p>
<p>Mandatory real money wagering has been introduced by the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Regulations for Gaming and Gambling Industry and is usually set by the Licensing Authority. All the serious and licensed casinos have to comply and follow these policies.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation was satisfactory. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
