<p>Aspire Global-owned Pariplay Ltd, a global aggregator of iGaming products, is building upon its partnership with Rush Street Interactive (RSI), a leading interactive gaming company based in the United States, to help the latter expand its product offering in Colombia.</p>
<p>More Gaming Products Coming to RushBet</p>
<p>As a result, Pariplay content and products will be made available to RSI’s local brand, RushBet.co, which will now have access to Pariplay products through the company’s proprietary Fusion gaming platform.</p>
<p>This will come with localized content that factors in players’ specific regional preferences. The pair of companies are expanding on what is a successful partnership in New Jersey, where RSI runs PlaySugarHouse.com, once again powered by some of Pariplay’s authentic content, and amid strong third-quarter results for Rush Street.</p>
<p>Pariplay and RSI both feel confident that the aggregated content brought by the company is a favorite in Colombia and will therefore allow the operator to reinforce its position in the Latin American market. An initial launch of 20 games will be added to RushBet.co with Dragons of the North, Wolf Riches, and Rumble Rhino Megaways among the shortlisted titles.</p>
<p>Colombia and Latin America Continue to Drive Interest</p>
<p>The partnership has been welcomed by both companies. Pariplay managing director Adrian Bailey praised Rush Street Interactive and pointed out the company’s successful track record in the United States, and not least the pair’s own relationship there:</p>
<p>“We know that we have a trusted and highly professional partner in them, and we are extremely proud to further grow our collaboration with them into new markets.” Pariplay managing director Adrian Bailey</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive CEO Richard Schwartz pointed out that the company had sufficient confidence in Pariplay’s products, citing the New Jersey experience where the games are a preferred option among players. The partnership in Colombia will result in a dynamic and highly personalized mobile gaming experience.</p>
<p>“Given that Pariplay’s high-quality games are already hugely successful with our New Jersey players, we expect our Colombian players will also enjoy them.” Rush Street Interactive CEO Richard Schwartz</p>
<p>Pariplay recently appointed Jorge Morales to lead the team’s expansion in the Caribbean region and Latin America, as interest in local markets has increased. Back in Europe, Pariplay teamed up with Kaizen Gaming to bring its Wizard Games.</p>
