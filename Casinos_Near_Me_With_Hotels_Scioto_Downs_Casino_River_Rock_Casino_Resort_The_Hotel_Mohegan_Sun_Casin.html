<p>5 Lucky Lions review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The titular lions from Five Lucky Lions are of the Chinese guardian variety. The ornate grotesque-style statues that stand at temple entrances and the like. They are rendered here in glorious fluffiness with each lion having its own colour.</p>
<p>The general theme is a kind of tranquil Chinese idyll watched over by statues which at any minute might come to life to give the player good fortune or to rain down destruction on them.</p>
<p>Big win in the 5 Lucky Lions slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The setting is beautifully rendered. The background shows an old disused temple dripping with mossy growth and surrounded by old untended statues. On the reels, however, a vibrant range of symbols dance constantly, animated in the winding manner of a Chinese lion in a new year’s parade.</p>
<p>The background music is a pleasing piece of traditional Chinese music with a lilting string section and thundering drums. It completes the atmosphere of the mythic that pervades this visually delightful slot.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>In yet another act of defiance against convention 5 Lucky Lions is played on an array of six reels, each of which are four symbols high. As eight is a lucky number in Chinese superstition, there are 88 win lines to play on.</p>
<p>The resulting gameplay is not wildly altered from the standard paradigm, though, and a free game bonus is the only variation offered from the base game.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Wild symbols substitute for any symbol except for the Scatter.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol pays out for three or more anywhere on any of the reels. It will also trigger a free spin bonus.</p>
<p>During the free spin bonus you can choose one of the lions to be the only lion on the free spins. During the free spins the selected lion will appear in stacks. The lower the value of the lion, the higher the number of spins, ranging from eight to eighteen.</p>
<p>Less spins with high paying symbol or the other way around? It's up to the player.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 97.93%, which is comfortably above the yardstick we use of 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested was from the minimum bet of $/£/€0.88 per spin up to a maximum bet per spin of $/£/€88.00. This might push some of the smallest bankrolls out of the market depending on how much you are willing to risk per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which is at the very lowest end of what we can match with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Paytable for basic symbols of the game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Five Lucky Lions is a nice slot. Visually pleasant and well animated, this slot is a delight to play. It also has a very nice return to player of 97.93% and the volatility is not dreadful.</p>
