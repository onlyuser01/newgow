<p>Blueprint Gaming continues to expand its reach in branded slot gaming with the company now securing the licensing rights to the personality and likeness of Diego Maradona, the legendary Argentinian soccer player, who will be featured in an upcoming slot release for the company.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming Has a Solid Track Record for Branded Slots</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming has extensive experience in delivering on such slots and projects with the D10S Maradona expected to become available to global audiences on November 17. The company has already developed a number of high-profile branded slots, including Rick and Morty, The Goonies, Ted, and Deal or No Deal.</p>
<p>Maradona is hailed for his exceptional talent on the field and is largely seen as one of the most successful players of all time in recorded history insofar as soccer is concerned. His name is synonymous with the sport he played and that is why Blueprint believes that securing this IP will give it a huge pull with sports audiences from all over the world. The release of the game is not a chance occurrence either.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming is keen to raise the visibility of its products with soccer fans who may be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to convert them into online casino players.</p>
<p>Auspicious Time to Have Maradona Slot Released</p>
<p>The upcoming World Cup in Qatar is to get underway on November 20, and it reflects on the company’s commitment to make the best of this period and bring the most worthwhile options to players as well. Blueprint Gaming head of commercial Lauren Bradley noted:</p>
<p>Maradona is another huge brand that we’ve been entrusted with, and I have no doubt our development team will once again craft a slot that treats a globally loved icon with the utmost attention to detail and authenticity. Blueprint Gaming head of commercial Lauren Bradley</p>
<p>Maradona brand agent, Matías Morla, also welcomed the partnership and said that Blueprint’s reputation spoke for itself. They have developed carefully-curated games, which is no doubt going to be the case with the upcoming D10S Maradona as well. “We had no hesitation in agreeing on the partnership and we thoroughly look forward to seeing the game launch featuring the greatest player of all time and an Argentinian legend,” Morla said.</p>
