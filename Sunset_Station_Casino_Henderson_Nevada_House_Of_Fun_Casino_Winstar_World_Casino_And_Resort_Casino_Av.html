    <h1>Sunset Station Casino Henderson Nevada House Of Fun Casino Winstar World Casino And Resort Casino Av</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming and CasinoGrounds have launched Book of Power with two Free Spin modes and the Expanding Symbol game mechanic</p>
<p>The online gaming aggregator and provider of casino content has chosen the largest casino streaming community in the world to release its freshest slot part of its iconic “Book” series, Book of Power. The new slot with a max win of up to 15,000x the stake, the classic Expanding Symbol game mechanic, and two different Free Spins modes has been called the provider’s Game of the Quarter.</p>

<p>The Most Refined Game in the Book Series</p>
<p>The new release from the premium business-to-business provider currently boasts the highest production quality from all of Relax Gaming’s previous “Book of” titles.</p>
<p>As explained by the company’s director of casino products Shelley Hannah, the previous “wonderful” collaborations with CasinoGrounds and positive feedback received from players convinced the two parties to once again reunite for the release of the new thrilling title. Hannah also spoke about the plethora of “exciting new features and excellent visuals” that have been integrated into the new game to create an unforgettable quest for players.</p>
<p>In February 2022, the two partnered for the launch of Beast Mode, a slot with high volatility inspired by the eighties. The Net Games slot released at the end of 2022 was the result of another excellent collaboration between the two when the streaming community once again had a say in the final development of the game.</p>
<p>In 2020, Relax Gaming and CasinoGrounds released Iron Bank, a Cuban-themed slot with a max win of 49998.9x the bet.</p>
<p>Giving Players What They Want</p>
<p>The 2016-founded CasinoGrounds streaming community is a group of online casino streamers and players looking to “set the grounds for our streamers and fans to share knowledge and discuss” all things related to online casinos.</p>
<p>Once again, the community has had its own say in the creation of the new title released together with Relax Gaming, making sure it hosts the most popular and appreciated game features preferred by players.</p>
<p>The game features a beautiful backdrop that carries players to what appears to be a pyramid’s entrance with two large statues on the sides. The soundtrack nicely complements the overall aesthetics and storylines.</p>
<p>While venturing through Ancient Egypt from the position of an explorer searching for the mysterious book that yields massive powers, players will come across lucrative features like the Free Spins and Power Free Spins modes, the Power Bet feature, Wild Book symbols, and Hot Mode.</p>
<p>During Free Spins mode, the Expanding Symbol is randomly selected and can expand to generate bigger payouts. During Power Free Spins, similar actions can occur, with additional Expanding Symbols and special win multipliers possibly making an appearance.</p>
<p>To increase their chances of activating a bonus game by 170%, the provider has created the Power Bet feature. At the same time, the Hot Mode boosts the chances of scoring a greater win while the Bonus Buy will engage the Free Spins bonus.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Relax Gaming announced the release of Horror Hotel, a new horror slot with the Mystery Symbol feature.</p>
