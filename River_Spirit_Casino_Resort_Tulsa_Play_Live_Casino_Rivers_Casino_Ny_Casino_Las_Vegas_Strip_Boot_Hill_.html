<p>The money will help the four recipients protect customers in their respective countries from gambling harm</p>
<p>ICE London 2023, the biggest exhibition of gambling providers, saw participants raise $63,798 for charity. This was announced by iGaming Business, an industry-oriented magazine owned by Clarion Gaming – the company behind the big event.</p>
<p>The proceeds will fund four organizations committed to tackling problem gambling. Each of the charities in question will receive a quarter of the total money raised. This means that the British organizations Better Change and Betknowmore, the American National Council on Problem Gambling and the Dutch AGOG will each receive a share of around $16,000.</p>
<p>The money was raised by sponsors of the ICE Consumer Protection Zone. This year, the zone features a record number stands where some of the best responsible gambling organizations can showcase their solutions and share news of their latest breakthroughs.</p>
<p>The money-raising initiative attracted many of the big names in the sector. Notable industry juggernauts such as Betsson, Bettor View, Flutter, Greentube, International Game Technology, Kindred Group, Les Ambassadeurs and Only Prizes all made a contribution, helping the initiative raise $63,798 for the cause.</p>
<p>Ewa Bakun Thanked the Contributors</p>
<p>Ewa Bakun, director of industry insight and engagement at Clarion Gaming, addressed the development, sharing her delight about the results of the fundraiser. She thanked everyone who contributed money to the cause, noting that the funds will reinforce the efforts of four key organizations that are already doing a lot in the safer gambling field.</p>
<p>Bakun added that this year’s edition of the ICE Consumer Protection Zone will donate money to two British organizations, reflecting the global importance of the British market.</p>
<p>This year we have included two organizations active outside the UK. This reflects the international credentials of ICE London, which consistently attracts industry professionals from more than 100 nations. Ewa Bakun, director of industry insight and engagement, Clarion Gaming</p>
