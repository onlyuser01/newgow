<p>Everi Digital continued to affirm its position as a leading supplier of casino content in North America</p>
<p>Supplier of casino content, financial technology and player loyalty solutions Everi Holdings announced that its digital arm, Everi Digital, has signed a content deal with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Portfolio of Titles</p>
<p>The agreement with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino stipulates that Everi Digital will deliver its online casino content via its proprietary Spark Remote Game Server (Spark RSG) which serves as a library for the company’s entire digital gaming catalog.</p>
<p>Matthew Sunderland, senior vice president of iGaming at Caesars Digital, outlined that the partnership with Everi Digital led to the integration into Caesars’ online platform of “even more captivating gaming content” that had proven its popularity among Caesars’ brick-and-mortar casino players.</p>
<p>“… this partnership is a welcomed addition to our digital operation as we continue to bolster our elevated gaming offering for our customers,” Sunderland concluded.</p>
<p>Everi Digital will deliver to online casino players at Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino a suite of nearly 70 engaging casino themes available via Spark RSG, including titles such as Triple Jackpot Gems, Crystal Star, and Black Diamonds.</p>
<p>David Lucchese, executive vice president of Sales, Marketing and Digital at Everi noted that the agreement with a top-tier operator such as Caesars would help Everi affirm its position as a leading supplier of online casino content as it would help it reach even more players across North America.</p>
<p>“Caesars is focused on extending their legacy of providing great gaming entertainment experiences to their online players and we are pleased to be providing them with engaging content that will help them meet this goal,” Lucchese added.</p>
<p>New Titles Coming down the Pipeline</p>
<p>As part of its ongoing commitment to growing the library of progressive gaming content popular among both land-based and online players, Everi will soon release new titles, including Gold Standard Jackpots, Lightning Zap, and the Super Jackpot Series comprising Super Jackpot Wild Gems, Super Jackpot Seven Seas, and Super Jackpot Double Lion.</p>
<p>Content delivered by Everi Digital is available at over 80 online casinos and more than 40 social casinos, serving as a testament to the popularity of the company as a supplier to the gaming industry and helping it to continue to grow its footprint in North America.</p>
<p>Spark RSG content is now available at iGaming operators in Connecticut, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia in the US, and Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, Quebec, Atlantic Canada, and Saskatchewan in Canada.</p>
<p>In British Columbia, Everi Digital’s parent signed an agreement last month with the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) to extend their partnership into anti-money laundering (AML).</p>
