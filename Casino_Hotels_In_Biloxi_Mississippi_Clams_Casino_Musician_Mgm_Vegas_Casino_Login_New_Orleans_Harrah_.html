    <h1>Casino Hotels In Biloxi Mississippi Clams Casino Musician Mgm Vegas Casino Login New Orleans Harrah</h1>

<p>i am a veteran in online gaming i have seen manythings happening wich is a shame that not one regulator reacts acordingly.long withdrawals up to month documents verifications wich take up to weeks glitches in softwares stalling tactics to tempt players to cancel withdrawals and no responsible gaming tools for a player to protect himself voided bets and confiscated winnings with excuses from here to mars and you just repeat what all casinos always claim that the games are auditted and fair and it is just bad luck(not you and not the casinos can proof that solid).as you know me i had several complaints here about curacao casinos wich most of them have real live tables and the winning chance is 50/50 that is what i call gambling but unfortunatly they dont want to pay or dont have tools to protect my winning.</p>
<p>Malta is the otherway you cant win because they only have the stupid live studio tables wich once in a while you get some of your own money back to keep you at play.why a new casino like wildz dont have a real live table ?that is because they have quaranteed profits from their providers because the games are so manipulated that casinos have no risk to lose big money and to protect the cashflow.their live games should be put in the slots section were they belong and not decieve players by claiming that they are live.if you want me i can show you my deposit history to proof that when ever i deposit at casino with real live table most of the time i win and when ever i deposit the casinos with only live studio always lose and never manege to be ahead.so make your own conclusion and stop repeating what casinos do.</p>
<p>i still want my deposits back from this casino for me a casino with no real live table is fully scam.</p>
