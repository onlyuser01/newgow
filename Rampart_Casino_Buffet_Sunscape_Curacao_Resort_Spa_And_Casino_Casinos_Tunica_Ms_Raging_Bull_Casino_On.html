<p>PlayUp Acquires Two Leading Fan and Athlete Media Platforms in Australia</p>
<p>PlayUp, the premium betting entertainment, and technology company announced on Monday that it purchased the leading fan and athlete media platforms in Australia – The Roar and AthletesVoice. It was back in 2015 when PlayUp developed Australia’s first pay-to-play daily fantasy platform (DFS). Since then, the company became the top DFS provider and enjoyed significant growth.</p>
<p>The company’s annual turnover is more than AUS$270 million and it has over 300,000 registered clients. As a result of this significant success, PlayUp announced that it is launching its media and content marketing division to “create a fully immersive entertainment experience” for the players.</p>
<p>Currently, the company operates in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, and India. PlayUp’s purchase of The Roar and AthletesVoice is also complemented by the company’s expansion into the North American online betting market. Furthermore, PlayUp has already secured licenses in several U.S. states. It is expected for the company to also list on the NASDAQ later this year.</p>
<p>The Roar and AthletesVoice’s CEO Shares His Excitement about the Acquisition</p>
<p>In a statement, Kerry McCabe, CEO of The Roar and AthletesVoice said that he is proud of what the organization has created for sports fans, athletes, and brands in Australia. Furthermore, he added that The Roar and AthletesVoice wanted to “shake things up a bit” in traditional media and overcome the “clickbait phenomenon“.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that with the help of a passionate team and the support of shareholders, the organization achieved that. Mr. McCabe did not miss saying that expanding into new markets was always a part of the strategy for AthletesVoice and The Roar, and now, such opportunity is present. In conclusion, he said that the team is energized and ready to evolve together with the international PlayUp team.</p>
<p>This month, both contributors and staff from The Roar and AthletesVoice will help the transition to PlayUp. At the same time, giving voice to Australian athletes and sports fans will remain on focus.</p>
<p>PlayUp Remains Committed to Offering Richest Experiences for Users</p>
<p>PlayUp’s Global CEO, Daniel Simic outlined that the organizations remain focused on providing dedicated users with exclusive experiences related to the games and players which they love. He added that with the creation of the company’s media and content marketing division, PlayUp would support its “goal to offer the richest user experience to drive loyalty, usage and lifetime value“.</p>
<p>“The creation of this division sets PlayUp apart in the DFS and betting category globally and underpins our goal to offer the richest user experience to drive loyalty, usage and lifetime value.” Daniel Simic, PlayUp Global CEO</p>
<p>Simic acknowledged that AthletesVoice is a respectable and trusted platform. Furthermore, he stressed that the platform connects sports fans with the help of a distribution network. On the other hand, Simic deemed The Roar as an iconic Australian media brand. According to Simic, between PlayUp and the large audiences reached by the two platforms, there is a “natural fit“.</p>
