<p>NetGaming is going to strengthen the library of games of one of Greece’s leading online gaming operators</p>
<p>Through a new exclusive link-up with Novibet, NetGaming is now going to deliver its portfolio of games with the company and make its titles available to local audiences, and Novibet’s players in particular.</p>
<p>The partnership is part of NetGaming’s ambitious plan to position its offer well across Europe and continue to deliver exclusive and high-quality titles developed with meticulous attention to design and the overall quality of the product.</p>
<p>NetGaming is planning on further launches in Greece, but for the time being, the company is fully engaged with Novibet as its first gateway into the country, and an introduction of local players to the studio’s award-winning games.</p>
<p>NetGaming has been building a selection of dedicated and highly-enjoyable games and content that combine exciting themes, gameplay mechanics, and features to bring around one of the most fulfilling and worthwhile experiences possible.</p>
<p>As of right now, Novibet will enjoy such NetGaming titles as Lucky Vault, 3 Wild Jokers, Juicy Gold 100, and more, with the full catalogue to be deployed throughout the rest of the year. Commenting on this opportunity Novibet casino product Foteini Matthaiou had nothing but praise to pay the casino’s newest iGaming supplier.</p>
<p>The deal as such is a significant milestone in Novibet’s overall strategy, as the operator is similarly interested to be recognized not just locally in Greece, but also internationally, Matthaiou added:</p>
<p>By joining forces with NetGaming, we are excited to bring an unparalleled selection of innovative and captivating gaming content to our esteemed players. Novibet casino product Foteini Matthaiou</p>
<p>He further said that Novibet is committed to providing the best possible experience for the players at the brand, and this starts with the inclusion of trusted and respected suppliers such as NetGaming.</p>
<p>NetGaming Confident in Further Growth Opportunities</p>
<p>NetGaming CEO Pallavi Deshmukh was similarly excited to see her company strengthen its presence in yet another important market.</p>
<p>She noted that the supplier has already launched in Belgium, Georgia, the United Kingdom, and not least – Michigan, the United States, with many more to follow.</p>
<p>“We are proud to partner with one of the top operators in Greece. It has been a great collaboration so far and we are looking forward to growing our business with Novibet,” Deshmukh added commenting on the most recent success in Greece.</p>
