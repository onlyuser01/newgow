    <h1>Washington Dc Casino Rhythm City Casino Davenport Iowa Horseshoe Baltimore Casino Casino In India Mo</h1>

<p>I I am a black level supposedly VIP customer at joker room VIP casino.</p>
<p>I have spent many thousands but I have also won many thousands from this casino. Over $18k</p>
<p>I did what I've done dozens of times before,</p>
<p>bought 2 Neosurf vouchers one for $50 the other for $100.</p>
<p>I combined them by putting them in my NeoSurf account, I made the deposit to JokaroomVIP, it said successful the funds disappeared out of my neosafe account it was never credited to my joker room account.</p>
<p>They have literally been dozens and dozens of emails, phone calls Joka blames Neosurf, Neosurf blames Joka.</p>
<p>I'm not kidding one of their representatives sent me an email saying the deposit wasn't successful because of a "delay at my end".</p>
<p>What pisses me off is I've spent thousands of dollars yet they automatically assume that I was trying to scam them it's ridiculous. Their rude one line answers which don't actually include any answer or support is terrible customer service.</p>
<p>It took me three days just to explain to the staff their own system including the account manager that rang me because they do not understand that you can pay with a neosurf voucher pin or you can pay with your neosurf account.</p>
<p>I made them 3 instructional videos, literally showing them how Neosurf works.</p>
<p>I provided the payment reference number from neosurf confirming they had paid joka room for my deposit. I sent them screenshots and I also made another instructional video where I go into my neosurf account, open my transaction history and show them the $150 transaction including the payment reference number.</p>
<p>I sent them an email from NEOSurf which is where they told me to go , excuse after excuse and Neosurf have confirmed that they have made the payment to jokela room and it came out of my account.</p>
<p>Jokavip keep replying with this absolutely frustrating rude annoying email, " I can confirm I didn't make the deposit".</p>
<p>For two guys they lied and said we have contacted me if directly all they did was get the PIN codes on the two vouchers which were never used at their casino and they went to Neosurfs website and used the" check my balance "that anyone anywhere in the world can use, yeah I had explained to them so many times those vouchers weren't used at their casino, my NEOSURF ACCOUNT. Was, yes they lied and said they went direct to Neosurf. It's laughable</p>
<p>They refuse to answer my DOT point responses one of them being your agent told me it was caused by a delay at my end so you can see the transaction why and how does that make me lose my money ??. (The neosurf transactions are instantaneous)</p>
<p>No response ever</p>
<p>I reported that 24-hour telephone numbers because none of them work one they never answer and I've rung it 20 or 30 times and it just rings out the other is a private citizen in California.</p>
<p>No response</p>
<p>I asked it to be escalated five times and it was eventually, once an account manager rang me however believe it or not he didn't know that you could combine your neosurf vouchers and deposit using your neosurf account not a pin.</p>
<p>To become a black level VIP player you have to spend a lot of money, why those rude idiots would throw away a customer like me, over a $150 dollars is mind boggling.</p>
<p>I've provided NEOsurf payment reference number.</p>
<p>I have provided screenshots</p>
<p>I have given them a video of me logging into my neosurf account and going to transaction history.</p>
<p>I have provided a video showing those gronks how to login their own website and make a neosurf account deposit.</p>
<p>I have provided an email from Neosurf confirming that the deposit into joka room was successful and I included reference number.</p>
<p>I made the $150 deposit on the 7th</p>
<p>I showed them I did the same thing with $400 thru my neosurf account 2 days prior , and dozens of times before that.</p>
<p>Makes no difference</p>
<p>I really don't care about the $150 I care how I've been treated.</p>
<p>They've lost over a Grand already because I haven't deposited again.</p>
<p>When casino staff lie, and actually get caught lying, they lose all credibility and trust and that's what it's all built around, I've been jokaroomVIP casino's loudest advocate because they do have awesome terms and conditions., being a VIP customer you should be believed in the very first instance and things investigated properly.</p>
<p>I'm disgusted in them.</p>
<p>After all the runaround this morning I get another BS email "I can confirm you didn't make the deposit GO speak to NEOsurf" so here we are back at square one again, it's incredible.</p>
<p>I told them they can shove the $150 up their ass and keep it I've absolutely had enough, I've wasted hours and hours, I've tried to help them with instructional videos, they move you from Jokaroom wildcard city to JokaroomVIP when you spend enough, they give U a couple extra bonuses but U are not treated as a VIP, that's just a name to make U think your important and valued by them.</p>
