<p>Play’n GO has launched Gargantooz, the latest addition to its iconic space-themed Reactoonz IP series that has turned into a fan-favorite over the years</p>
<p>The business-to-business leading online slots provider responsible for some of the world’s popular games in the industry including Book of Dead and Moon Princess, Play’n GO, has announced the expansion of its equally successful Reactoonz IP series with Gargantoonz.</p>
<p>The new slot once again carries players to deep space in the mesmerizingly colorful sci-fi world envisioned by the studio, finally answering the wishes of its fandom who have been patiently waiting for the release.</p>
<p>The game closely follows the events of Gigantoonz launched in 2022, when Dr Toonz managed to effectively forge the very first small one-eyed Gargantoon.</p>
<p>Now, the same Dr is determined to run a few prize-winning experiments on the lucky Gargantoon and this way usher him into the Reactoonz society and trigger massive riches.</p>
<p>Gargantoonz Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Rows: 7</p>
<p>7 Reels: 7</p>
<p>7 Paylines: 5</p>
<p>5 Volatility: Medium-High</p>
<p>Medium-High Max win: 7,000x</p>
<p>7,000x RTP: 96%</p>
<p>96% Min/Max Bet: 0.20-100</p>
<p>0.20-100 Release date: November 30, 2023</p>
<p>Gamma Rays, the Black Hole, and Supernova Features</p>
<p>The game is played on a beautifully designed 7×7 cascading grid set against a deep blue backdrop that mimics the dark space. The void’s darkness is clearly interrupted by the nicely colored Reactoonz symbols representing the crazy characters.</p>
<p>Your main goal as a player is to clear a minimum of five alien-themed clusters to score a win. As Dr Toonz is getting ready to test out a series of brand-new experiments, including his Gamma Rays, the Black Hole, and Supernova.</p>
<p>As the meter is charged and it proceeds to unlock each new experiment, players enjoy new ways to scoop up more wins on the grid with the help of extra Wilds and increasing Multipliers.</p>
<p>The final goal of the game which “continues to show the growth and innovation in grid slots” pioneered by Play’n GO, is to evolve the tiny Gargantoon to his apex form seen in the previous releases.</p>
<p>The company’s games ambassador, Magnus Wallentin, expressed their thrill for being able to bring back the Reactoonz series “with more out-of-this-world features.”</p>
<p>Wallentin explained that, in the year that had passed since the latest release from the series, they tried to come up with ways to “innovate the series” while preserving all the features that have triggered the success of the series.</p>
<p>The games ambassador explained that, once players start to use the Black Hole, Supernova and Gamma Ray features, they will be pulled at the core of the experiment.</p>
<p>The news comes after Play’n GO announced inking a new strategic partnership agreement with BeyondPlay in October.</p>
