    <h1>Turning Stone Casino Rooms Mega Casino Vegas X Casino Login Century Casino Cape Girardeau Casino In</h1>

<p>It’s been almost nine months since a Ferrari driver won a Formula 1 event. Maybe it’s time for that to change this Sunday at the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne where the Australian Grand Prix will take place</p>
<p>It’s time for the third Formula 1 race of the 2023 season, and the winners of the first two – Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez – are the top two betting favorites to win the Australian GP on Sunday.</p>
<p>If the oddsmakers are right, it means that we’ll see Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT record the third win of the season. Of course, the people from Ferrari are determined not to let that happen. Will they succeed in ruining their rival’s plans? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Max Verstappen Coming to Australia as a -300 Favorite</p>
<p>The reigning F1 champ is the only driver with minus odds, suggesting that bookies are convinced he’s going to win the 2022 Australian Grand Prix. If he does win, it’s going to be his first-ever triumph in Australia.</p>
<p>The fact that he’s never won the race in Melbourne actually isn’t too much of his fault. Last season, he finished second, grabbing an extra point for the fastest lap. The man who won the last year’s event is Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc. However, oddsmakers don’t think he’s going to do it again.</p>
<p>Charles Leclerc &amp; Ferrari Dreaming of Victories</p>
<p>The last time a driver from Ferrari won an F1 race was in July 2022 when Charles Leclerc won the Austrian GP. It was his third and final win of the season. The other two happened in Bahrain and Australia.</p>
<p>In 2023, the Bahrain Grand Prix has already been driven. It was a disaster for Leclerc, but not because of something he did. Instead, his car malfunctioned, forcing him to abandon the race.</p>
<p>In the second race of the 2023 F1 season, things went slightly better for him. Leclerc finished seventh, which isn’t great for his standards, but there’s one thing that’s giving him hope – he was second in the qualifying classification.</p>
<p>2023 Australian Grand Prix Prediction</p>
<p>Obviously, Max Verstappen is the best driver in the world in 2023, so betting against him would be crazy. We do think he’s going to triumph at the 2023 Australian GP, but so do the bookies. Priced at -300, the Dutchman just isn’t too tempting an option for bettors.</p>
<p>Instead, his rival from Ferrari might be a better bet. Charles Leclerc probably won’t win this race, but we can see him get on the podium.</p>
<p>Pick: Charles Leclerc to finish in the top 3</p>
