    <h1>Best Usa Online Casinos Casino Coushatta Online Casino Bonuses Cherokee Casino Hotels Little Creek C</h1>

<p>Sports IQ, a company out of North America that specializes in odds-making, announced today that it entered into an agreement with Sporting Solutions, the B2B division of Sporting Group, to become its exclusive provider of US sports player-props markets.</p>
<p>Player Props across B2B and B2C</p>
<p>The multi-year agreement between Sports IQ and the B2B business acquired by French lottery and gaming operator and fourth-biggest lottery group in the world Française des Jeux (FDJ), as part of the acquisition of Sporting Group in 2019, covers both B2B and B2C portfolios of Sporting Solution’s betting partners.</p>
<p>Sports IQ will take charge of odds making to offer customers at Sporting Solutions unrivaled pre-game and live game experiences, covering a broad range of US sports events, including games from the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new agreement, Sporting Solutions CEO Andy Wright underscored the alignment between Sporting Solutions and Sports IQ in terms of “cutting-edge technology to provide innovative products and services to the betting and gaming industry.”</p>
<p>This partnership will accelerate our strategy to provide the North American Market with our market leading expertise in trading and risk management services, in addition to us building upon our recent successful managed service integrations with Ontario and Alberta.” Andy Wright, CEO, Sporting Solutions</p>
<p>Expansion in Alberta and Ontario</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Sporting Solutions became part of a team, together with NeoPollard Interactive and Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis (AGLC), to launch the Play Alberta platform and officially make the Canadian province a regulated sports betting jurisdiction with a fully-functioning online gambling website. Sporting Solutions also entered into a similar deal with the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG).</p>
<p>Sporting Solutions has an exceptional reputation in the global gaming industry. We’re delighted to attach our names to theirs and power their continued growth with innovative product lines. With the recent announcements of the OLG and AGLC as clients of Sporting Solution, it’s particularly exciting for us to be able to support operators in our very own backyard here in Canada.” Omer Dor, CEO, Sports IQ</p>
<p>Founded by a group of sports betting industry veterans in 2018, Sports IQ quickly developed its proprietary technology to enable it to respond to the needs of modern-day sportsbooks in North America and around the world. Sports IQ’s industry-leading live player props allow its sports betting partners to offer their clients wagering on almost every conceivable action in a game.</p>
<p>The agreement with Sporting Solutions is the latest in a series of agreements Sports IQ reached with sports betting partners globally, including Betway, FansUnite, BetClic, IGT and others, as part of the company’s plan to boost growth in North America, for which it raised $7 million in a series of seed funding.</p>
<p>Earlier in September, the player-prop specialist signed a deal with Betway to power its pre-game and in-play player-props in the US, while a month prior, Canadian sports, gaming and technology company FansUnite teamed with the oddsmaker to receive its full portfolio of pre-match and live player props.</p>
