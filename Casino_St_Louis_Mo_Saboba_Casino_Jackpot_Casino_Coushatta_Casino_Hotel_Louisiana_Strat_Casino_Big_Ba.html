    <h1>Casino St Louis Mo Saboba Casino Jackpot Casino Coushatta Casino Hotel Louisiana Strat Casino Big Ba</h1>

<p>And your second opinion to contact floxypay.io..</p>
<p>I dnt deal with crypto.</p>
<p>I dnt even have an account with this site which you have given.</p>
<p>If its a upi payment provider BIG BAAZI SHOULD CONTACT THEM TO GET CLARITY WHY WILL I Do..</p>
<p>And on top of this they will nt even answer as i am not there customer.</p>
<p>This is big baazi who needs to serve the customer and get it resolved.</p>
<p>I hope i tried to explain you what you want me to do and what will happen if i do...</p>
<p>Floxypay.io</p>
<p>This is a payment gateway for crypto users</p>
<p>What will i do by contacting them</p>
<p>If you have a description step by step i can do that what you are requesting.</p>
<p>I am not a crypto buyer neither i deal with crypto nor i have made any deposits through crypto nor i have an account with this website that is floxypay.io.</p>
<p>What do you want me to do please explain step by step.</p>
<p>Whom to contact or where to share the email to which email id.you should be aware about this process peter as you are suggesting me to do that.</p>
<p>This clearly shows that the money deposit to big baazi is not at all safe as they can anytime say that they have not received the deposit and the player should run and run for 60 days now to know where the money is.</p>
<p>This shows how responsible gambling works right.this shows how rules are made only for players not for casino sites...</p>
<p>This also shows that casino guru is only considering the evidence provided by big baazi but the evidence provided by the player and his bank are not at all considered.</p>
<p>Why cant big baazi contact floxypay.io as you suggested.what will i do by contacting them..infact where to contact them.if you can please write here in the open forum so even the world can know what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Simple..please guide me like a baby steps for both your suggestions given by you or casino guru with a proper explanation why i need to do this and how i need to do this and whom to contact or whom to send an email.</p>
<p>This is what i have received if i go to your suggested website that is floxypay.io</p>
<p>Please check this screeshot as well</p>
