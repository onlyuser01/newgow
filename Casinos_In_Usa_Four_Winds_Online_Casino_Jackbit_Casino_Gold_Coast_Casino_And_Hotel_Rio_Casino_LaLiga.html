    <h1>Casinos In Usa Four Winds Online Casino Jackbit Casino Gold Coast Casino And Hotel Rio Casino LaLiga</h1>

<p>Professional Spanish football league LaLiga has finally launched its B2B solution on the market after six years of development. Named LaLiga Tech, it will provide products that improve fan and bettor engagement.</p>
<p>LaLiga Tech Enters the Market</p>
<p>LaLiga Tech will work based on three pillars: fan engagement, content enhancement, and competition management. Those products will greatly help clients across the gambling and entertainment industries to improve their offerings.</p>
<p>LaLiga Tech’s fan engagement offerings will have technologies that help for the creation of competition applications such as fantasy sports, as well as OTT streaming platforms.</p>
<p>The content enhancement section is armed with Mediacoach – a real-time data and statistics platform. Additionally, LaLiga Tech will also provide clients with content integrity services that help prevent match-fixing, piracy, and other fraud through algorithm and pattern recognition.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of competition management, LaLiga Tech offers customizable AI analytics software, as well as dashboards that will help clients to keep an eye on the digital space.</p>
<p>With more than 140 experts at its disposal, LaLiga Tech seems to be a promising addition to the market. The division’s chief executive officer, Miguel Ángel Leal, commented on the launch:</p>
<p>“Sports and entertainment has an enormous opportunity to build on its emotional connection with fans by taking a data-led approach to understand fan behaviors and design modern, engaging and profitable experiences,” Leal said.</p>
<p>He added that LaLiga Tech’s products are specifically created for the sector and are driven by the same people who have guided La Liga to the position of a digital leader.</p>
<p>The B2B Division Signs Two Deals</p>
<p>LaLiga Tech has been quick to establish its presence on the market through a deal with the professional tennis league World Padel Tour. The B2B company will introduce new fan-oriented tech platforms to its new partner and will work to boost World Padel Tour’s image through new fan experiences.</p>
<p>Enrique Marques, WPT’s director of communications, has revealed some details about the deal.</p>
<p>“We want to have a solid OTT platform, and we will build that with LaLiga shortly,” he said, revealing that WPT will soon be armed with a new streaming service. Additional deal details haven’t been announced.</p>
<p>World Padel Tour’s chief executive officer, Mario Hernando, is glad to be working with LaLiga Tech. He believes that the B2B tech provider “shows a completeness of vision” for engaging fans through the clever use of tech and data. Hernando added that the success of LaLiga attests to LaLiga Tech’s capabilities.</p>
<p>LaLiga Tech also scored a deal with telecommunications company Millicom that will see the latter adopt LaLiga Tech’s anti-fraud solution to the Tigo Sports pay-TV network in order to protect its content.</p>
<p>LaLiga Tech already has an impressive lineup of partners. It lists pay-TV Sky Mexico, Dorna Sports, and the Belgian Pro League.</p>
