    <h1>Cosmopolitan Casino Las Vegas Doubledown Casino Forum 7Bit Casino Login Online Casino Real Money No</h1>

<p>Hello I deposited 200 euros at the said casino plus 100% bonus wager 30x d + b (but indicated 25xD + D for first and second deposit with max bet 2) so I started to gamble for a long time nothing ran to 0.8 cents then I changed the stake on 0.4 cent hit just under 400 profit, mountain slowly went up played for a while on 0.8 cents and 1 euro.</p>
<p>At some point win came so that I adjust the stake to max bet whoosh next win 670x then a with 500x at some point I noticed that something was wrong constantly I was logged out and the game sessions broke apprupt again logged into the game the whole thing happened 4 or 5 at some point I probably got double the plus when betting so that I didn't have 2 euros but 2.4 bets when I noticed that about 15 spins were over immediately I changed the bet size back to 2 euros hours later wager from as much as 12,000 euros at 99% and 2400 euros profit then suddenly the balance jumped back on the deposit amount. I wrote to support and told me all the winnings were canceled because I accidentally exceeded the max bet by 40 cents because of the 15 spin. What I of course find ridiculous with such wagers and the number of spins I turned in the entire course, all the wins that were achieved were under max bet, I have to say. Can I claim my winnings somehow, I mean it was not a presumed intention but an oversight and in my eyes a minimal violation where mercy could prevail is not that I turned all over max bet with almost 9600 spins. Can someone help me or advise what or whether I can do something about it at all</p>
<p>Thank you very much and greetings from Austria</p>
