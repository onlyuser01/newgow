<p>BETER, the company that focuses on providing the quickest and most advanced engagement, retention and entertainment solutions in the betting industry has recently appointed Evgeniy Bekker as its new esports general manager.</p>
<p>Evgeniy Will Promote BETER’s Growth in the Market</p>
<p>The new position that Evgeniy will now fill has been designed as a means of directing and supporting the company’s “ambitious” plans to expand on the market. The company with a one-of-a-kind approach to the field of esports has managed to enter the mainstream industry in recent years, and it has been going through a fast-paced transformation ever since. At the moment, BETER is busy challenging standard sports as we all know it as the main discipline across all available gaming-related verticals.</p>
<p>The company’s next-gen products allow players to select their preferred esports disciplines and titles. Talking about his promotion, Bekker said that he was fully confident that their team will successfully unlock the exact potential of betting in the esports world. He added that BETER’s partners should expect “something very exciting” as a result, while expressing his own excitement to take on the new role.</p>
<p>Bekker Is BETER’s Former Chief Trading Officer</p>
<p>In 2020, Bekker joined BETER as chief trading officer and became responsible for scaling the growth and expansion of the company. His well-established reputation in the industry as an “iGaming heavyweight with in-depth knowledge of all aspects of sportsbook management” as described by BETER was one of the main reasons why he was selected for the promotion.</p>
<p>Promising to offer the very best in esports, BETER currently covers 400 worldwide esports tournaments with plenty of pre-match and in-play content with the help of data from equipped partner Bayes Esports. BETER also specializes in live data, live streaming, as well as 24/7 odds that can be accessed all year. Players can enjoy over 21,000 Virtual eComp tournaments and ESportsBattles.</p>
<p>Powered by an in-house trading team made of 150 people and displaying a 7% sustainable margin, BETER Esports represents a good solution for organizers of tournaments who are looking to live stream their events and sportsbooks and betting providers searching to fill their free airtime with content that is more engaging. BETER also strives to support the esports community in general by helping operator partners obtain new customers while boosting their user retention rates.</p>
<p>In August, BETER announced that it would power esports data company Abios with esoccer and ebasketball content. During the same month, the esports, sports betting data, and casino content provider announced a new eFootball stream widget.</p>
