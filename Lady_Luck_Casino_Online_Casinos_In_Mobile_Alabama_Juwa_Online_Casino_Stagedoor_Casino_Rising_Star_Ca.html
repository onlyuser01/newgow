    <h1>Lady Luck Casino Online Casinos In Mobile Alabama Juwa Online Casino Stagedoor Casino Rising Star Ca</h1>

<p>Genius Sports has become one of the early entrants into the sports betting market in Maine, which launched on Friday morning last week. The company, which specializes in the provision of data and technological solutions for sports and sports betting verticals, has obtained a temporary license to operate in the state by the Maine Gambling Control Unit.</p>
<p>The company is joining the likes of established sportsbooks, including DraftKings and Caesars, which are making a play for the highly coveted market in the Pine Tree State. Thanks to this new license, Genius Sports now has 43 certifications to operate in different markets, with a significant focus on North America through the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Genius Sports CEO Mark Locke has welcomed the exciting news and thanked the regulator for granting the company a temporary gaming license to ensure that sportsbooks have access to its established and ground-breaking technology, data, and tools.</p>
<p>"Powered by the highest quality official data, our products are proven to help sportsbooks drive trading profits and cost efficiencies while engaging players at every step," Locke added. Genius Sports is one of the most prominent data companies in the regulated gambling market in North America, powering 98% of the sportsbook operators in this specific geography.</p>
<p>The company is also the exclusive supplier of NFL Official League Data, which puts it in a very strong position with customers. Genius Sports is similarly teamed up with the Canadian Football League, helping the organization leverage its data and drive valuable and actionable insights for audiences. Just like with the NFL, Genius Sports is seeking to ensure that the data can bring more commercial benefits to the CFL.</p>
<p>Maine Gambling Control Unit Director Milt Champion added that the overall pace of regulation has been a slow one in the hopes of ensuring that everything happened the right way. It has been almost 15 months since Maine legalized sports gambling to its launch last week.</p>
<p>Presently, only DraftKings and Caesars have made their intentions about entry into the state known. There are up to 10 commercial sportsbook licenses to be granted to various operators in the Pine Tree State with more updates to follow in good time.</p>
