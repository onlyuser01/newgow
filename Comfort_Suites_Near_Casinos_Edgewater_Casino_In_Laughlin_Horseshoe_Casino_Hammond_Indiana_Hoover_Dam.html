<p>Codere Group inked a partnership deal with Club Atlético Lanús, which will be reflected in Codere’s logo on the team’s jerseys</p>
<p>Codere, a multinational gaming and sports betting leader, unveiled a new agreement with Club Atlético Lanús, a sports club from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Codere will sponsor the team, which will promote the operator in turn.</p>
<p>As agreed, Club Atlético Lanús’ players will bear Codere-Bingo Lanús’ logo on their jerseys, right under their player number. These players will debut the new uniforms during their game against Club Atlético Colón on January 29.</p>
<p>Codere has long supported Club Atlético Lanús, having served as its sponsor between 1999 and 2016. The current agreement will resume and deepen the ties between the sports team and the gambling company.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Codere will serve as the team’s sponsor by the end of the year, during which time the two parties will participate in various joint activations and marketing initiatives.</p>
<p>Both Parties Were Happy to Sign the Deal</p>
<p>Codere is very happy to sign this deal. According to Bernando Chena, the regional manager of Codere Latam (excluding Mexico), the new agreement resumes an important historic relationship. He added that his entire team is convinced that the renewed alliance will benefit all parties involved. Chena concluded that by teaming up with Club Atlético Lanús, Codere “made a winning bet.”</p>
<p>Luis María Chebel, Club Atlético Lanús’s president, resonated with Chena’s sentiments saying that welcoming back Codere as a sponsor is a very happy development for Lanús. Chebel said that this is likely the beginning of a new successful stage for both entities.</p>
<p>Fans will soon get to see the Club Atlético Lanús players in their new jerseys. The upcoming game will be on January 29, which is the first match day of the country’s first-division soccer league. The game is set to take place at the Brigadier General Estanislao López Stadium, in the City of Santa Fe.</p>
<p>Codere Is Committed to Supporting Argentine Sports</p>
<p>Codere is a global company with operations spanning the entire LATAM region and Europe. However, the company marked its humble beginnings in Argentina, in the early 90s. Because of this, Argentine sports are very important to the company.</p>
<p>Right now, Codere is the biggest bingo operator in Buenos Aires. The Bingo Lanús game room, which Club Atlético Lanús will represent, opened in 1991 and is now a huge casino with bingo stands, gaming machines and over 635 slots.</p>
<p>The agreement with the club attests to Codere’s commitment to local sports and is a move that will popularize the operator among local bettors.</p>
