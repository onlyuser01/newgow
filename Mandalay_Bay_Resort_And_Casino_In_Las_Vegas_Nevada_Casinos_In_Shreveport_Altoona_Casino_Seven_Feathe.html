    <h1>Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino In Las Vegas Nevada Casinos In Shreveport Altoona Casino Seven Feathe</h1>

<p>Hi there Guru ,</p>
<p>I have some real concerns over goldenbet casino . I made a withdrawal which I thought was made via their sepa/ swift option. However they are now telling me it is called an IBAN transfer . They told me it would be in my bank instantly. They then tried telling me that due to new rules I would need to contact my bank for security purposes.</p>
<p>Then they changed their tune again and said I should contact them back the next morning.</p>
<p>I did that they then sent the apparent trace id which my bank cannot trace . They also have not provided me with the time of transaction and exact method. I am waiting for a 750 pound and a 700 pound withdrawal.</p>
<p>I also then came across something extremely strange . Roletto and goldenbet are exactly the same company . Look at this . I opened a chat with roletto whilst logged in to my goldenbet account.</p>
<p>Could you please help guru</p>
