<p>William Hill is forging ahead with its expansion efforts across the U.S. The popular British brand is now eyeing Nevada for an immediate scaling of its operations throughout the state.</p>
<p>William Hill Gets the Sports Betting Go-Ahead in Nevada</p>
<p>After making a modest entry in the U.S., William Hill is set to grow its operations at a good clip, adding new venues and opportunities to monetize on the heyday of sports betting. The bookmaker has been offered an opportunity by Nevada to introduce seven additional sportsbooks across the state.</p>
<p>The regulatory approval comes from the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), which has issued approval and recommendations about the upcoming betting venues of the operator, citing places in Las Vegas and Laughlin. There will be other sites in North Las Vegas, Reno, and throughout the Stateline region, next to the border with California.</p>
<p>Positioning properties with California would allow for an additional stream of revenue as Californians are packing up to place legal sports wagers in neighboring Nevada. William Hill has already chosen an expert partner as well, with Golden Entertainment agreeing to lend its properties. As a result, new William Hill-branded sportsbooks will appear at:</p>
<p>Stratosphere Casino</p>
<p>Arizona Charlie’s Boulder</p>
<p>Arizona Charlie’s Decatur</p>
<p>Aquarius Casino Resort, Laughlin</p>
<p>William Hill also remains hopeful to secure a racebook and sports space at the Eldorado Hotel a Casino in Reno as well as Montbleu, in the Stateline region. Both partnerships are in collaboration with Eldorado Resorts. This doesn’t yet cover the expansion as envisaged by William Hill, as the bookmaker will be adding Jerry’s Nugget Casino in North Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Nevada’s Gaming Control Board Looks Favorably on William Hill</p>
<p>William Hill U.S. is in the process of selling 20% of its U.S. business to Eldorado, a move that the NGCB has given a nod to. The final revision of the deal by the board will come on January 24, when the regulator will examine the partnership one last time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, William Hill remains committed to the idea of upgrading both its sports betting facilities as well as boosting its iGaming engagement and technological footprint. A point confirmed by William Hill U.S. CEO Joe Asher:</p>
<p>We’ll typically go in and upgrade the facilities, put in our equipment and the display systems that we use.</p>
<p>Looking at the pure numbers, William Hill is definitely one of the largest brands in the United States. Out of the 190 sportsbooks currently active in Nevada, 107 are the company’s property. This amounts to 30% of the total market share, according to William Hill. Meanwhile, the company continues with thinking about expanding further in the U.S as it already owns 137 bookmakers across the entire country.</p>
<p>William Hill was also the first company which started accepting sports bets in New Jersey, shortly after the federal ban known as PASPA 1992 was repealed. Not late after, William Hill began accepting mobile wagers as well!</p>
