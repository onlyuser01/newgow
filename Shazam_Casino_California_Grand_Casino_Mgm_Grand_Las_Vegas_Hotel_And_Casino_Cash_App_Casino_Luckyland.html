<p>The Delhi Capitals will be the first Indian cricket academy to team up with the famous sports technology provider</p>
<p>Sports tech leader Sportradar has unveiled a new partnership agreement with the Delhi Capitals, an Indian Premier League franchise. The collaboration will see the cricket team designate Sportradar as the official technology partner of the Delhi Capitals Academy.</p>
<p>The three-year deal will see Sportradar support and bolster the Delhi Capitals’ academy program, nurturing the development of young talents in professional cricket.</p>
<p>The sports technology company will also leverage FrogBox, a live-streaming tech solution, to help the Delhi Capitals grow. Currently, over 500 cricket clubs across England, Australia and Europe also use the FrogBox solution.</p>
<p>As agreed, Sportradar will furthermore deploy a market-leading electronic scoring app and a mobile-responsive match center to host live streams and share highlights of fixtures in addition to broadcasting live scores, scorecards and results.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sportradar will provide the Delhi Capitals Academy with its fan engagement and coaching application, Lilypad. Lilypad will allow the cricket team to curate highlights from streamed matches. This will make it easy for the team to compile games into playlists. These playlists can then be shared with students for coaching purposes or on social media to engage fans of the cricket franchise.</p>
<p>Sportradar Is Happy to Help the Capitals Nurture New Talent</p>
<p>Dhiraj Malhotra, Delhi Capitals’ chief executive officer, commented on the agreement, saying that the agreement with Sportradar is a key milestone for the cricket franchise. In addition, Malhotra noted that the Capitals are the first academy in India to join forces with the sports technology specialist and leverage its innovative video tech to develop new talents.</p>
<p>This partnership adds value in several ways including enriching local talent and boosting engagement with our fans. We look forward to working with Sportradar to help grow the game. Dhiraj Malhotra, CEO, Delhi Capitals</p>
<p>Jarod Pickering, Sportradar’s head of cricket, also commented on the agreement, praising the Delhi Capitals for identifying and nurturing the next generation of talent through their academy program. He added that his team will work hard to help the Capitals realize their vision for the academy:</p>
<p>We will be working closely with Delhi Capitals to help realize their vision for the academy and will also reach out to more academies in India to showcase how our technological solutions can be used to further develop the sport that the entire nation is incredibly passionate about. Jarod Pickering, head of cricket, Sportradar</p>
