    <h1>Shreveport Casino Treasure Bay Casino Biloxi Mississippi Is Ignition Casino Legit Morongo Casino Roo</h1>

<p>I am afraid that there is nothing we can do here. It is purely on casino decision to close your account and they have right for it. If the account is without any balance then we are forced to reject your complaint as unustified.</p>
<p>Imagine that you decide to organize a poker turnament in your apartment for your friends. So some of your friends come, but in some moment of the tournament you will feel very uncomfortable because of how one of your friends play. It is your right to ask him to leave (yes you should give him the money what he currently have in play) but it is your decision if you believe that you don't want him there.</p>
<p>I don't know why casino decided to close your account, but they are not closing the accounts without a reason so there is probably something what is suspicious on your account and they simply decided to not risk it. And they have a right for this decision.</p>
