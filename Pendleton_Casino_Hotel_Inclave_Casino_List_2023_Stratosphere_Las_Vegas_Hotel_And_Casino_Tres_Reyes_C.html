    <h1>Pendleton Casino Hotel Inclave Casino List 2023 Stratosphere Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Tres Reyes C</h1>

<p>Hi Villiam, they have said they want the money! That was end of July but that money has not been received! My bank have done a full</p>
<p>investigation and no money has be. Received by them and they did a further afield search also, with no result! The casino closed my</p>
<p>account down, not myself, because I told them I had spoken to the police about them Not paying my money to me so they closed it down as risk management! That is just guilt as far as I’m concerned!! Other reviews on their casino have said the same thing that they do this but I didn’t see this till After I had played! I just get the same answer from them all the time ‘ my withdrawal was processed on 30/7/20’ but they take no responsibility that it’s not been received! My bank have done everything they possibly can and there has been no such payment sent! It was apparently a SEPA payment when it should have been a swift payment, which the bank cannot trace and the casino won’t do a trace on their own payment! It’s £700 so you’d think they would be worried where there money had gone?? Thanks Viliam, I appreciate you working with me I n this! I liked playing on the casino, it’s a shame this had happened ☹️</p>
