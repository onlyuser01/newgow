<p>Red Rake Gaming, the leading provider of premium casino content, announced a new collaboration for the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands. The premium provider of iGaming content revealed Tuesday that it expanded its Dutch market footprint thanks to a collaboration with the Belgian provider of sports betting, horse racing and casino gambling games, Bingoal.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the recent collaboration, Red Rake Gaming agreed to power Bingoal's Dutch-facing operations by delivering a diverse selection of its top-performing localized games. As a result, customers of the operator in the Netherlands will have the opportunity to access Red Rake Gaming's non-stop action-packed slot called Super25Stars. The unique game delivers thrilling and engaging experiences by combining different bonus rounds from the company's Super series.</p>
<p>What's more, Bingoal's Dutch customers will be able to access additional games from Red Rake Gaming. Such include the exciting Guardians of Luxor, Million 777 Wheel, Ultra Burst and Buffalo on Fire!, among other fan-favorite titles that have already proven their popularity.</p>
<p>Dany Salmon, Bingoal's Casino Product Manager, shared his excitement regarding the latest collaboration with Red Rake Gaming in a statement. "We couldn't be happier about our partnership with Red Rake Gaming," he said.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Salmon noted: "Their exceptional game design and innovative features perfectly align with our commitment to deliver an extraordinary gaming experience to our customers. Get ready for an unparalleled gaming adventure at Bingoal!"</p>
<p>Nick Barr, Red Rake Gaming Malta's Managing Director, shared Salmon's excitement and explained that the company is delighted to join forces with Bingoal. According to Barr, the new collaboration helps expand further Red Rake Gaming's position within the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands. "Bingoal has a wealth of experience in delivering the best solutions across its markets and we are proud to be selected as their newest partner," he added.</p>
<p>Barr said that the Dutch market represents an important jurisdiction for the company and added that Red Rake Gaming's portfolio is well-received by customers in the country. Finally, he said: "We very much look forward to launching with Bingoal and very confident their players will love our games."</p>
<p>It was back in September 2021 when Bingoal secured a license from the gambling regulator in the Netherlands. This effectively enabled the company to offer online games of chance. Then, Bingoal launched its Dutch website. Now, thanks to the new collaboration, the online casino will be powered by Red Rake Gaming's titles.</p>
