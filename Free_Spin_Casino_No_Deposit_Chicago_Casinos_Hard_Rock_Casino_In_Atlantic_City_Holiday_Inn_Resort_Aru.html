    <h1>Free Spin Casino No Deposit Chicago Casinos Hard Rock Casino In Atlantic City Holiday Inn Resort Aru</h1>

<p>SOS * Can someone help me here?</p>
<p>Following problem with TouchCasino (Gammix Ltd) :</p>
<p>7200 € in withdrawal requests canceled and deleted / reason: violation of the terms and conditions due to bonus conditions.</p>
<p>Confiscation trigger : Bets over €5 with bonus balance</p>
<p>I describe my approach:</p>
<p>On the night of July 29th, 2022 I registered at TouchCasino.</p>
<p>I won almost 2000 euros from 80 euros (+120 euros welcome bonus money) and gave them up for withdrawal. Unfortunately, I missed the bonus condition, which of course is entirely my own responsibility. I spun to 6€ and 7.50€ a few times in the session (unconsciously but okay I own my mistake) but didn't make any decisive profits for the payout (verifiable). Meanwhile, my account was successfully verified. I also often spoke to the support and they also informed me about bonuses and payouts. Too bad nobody told me that my money would be confiscated. So I was treated like a winner in chat even though you already knew you weren't paying out?</p>
<p>The next day I deposited another €120 and played. After I lost the €120 that I deposited again (WITHOUT BONUS) (account was not at 0 to a few cents), I canceled one of the withdrawal requests again and then made a total profit of over €9000.</p>
<p>In summary: Terms and conditions for bonuses violated, bonuses implemented and paid out. Nothing happens. Deposited money without bonus the next day, but didn't lose it all! Canceled a payout and made almost €9500 out of it. I wake up and see all withdrawal requests canceled with this email :</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are writing to you regarding your withdrawal request of €7,194.00. Unfortunately we had to reject your withdrawal request due to a breach of our terms and conditions as you placed bets with an active bonus over the limit:</p>
<p>Therefore, your withdrawal request was rejected and the winnings made were voided. However, your original deposit has been credited to your balance. You are welcome to submit a new withdrawal request.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions, concerns or comments, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service team.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Payments cashier.</p>
<p>How should I proceed here? Are there perhaps people here who have contact with the Gammix squad?</p>
