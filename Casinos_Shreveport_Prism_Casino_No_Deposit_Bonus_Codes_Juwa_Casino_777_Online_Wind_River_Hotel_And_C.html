<p>The New York Post is ready to embrace sports, and perhaps by extension, the betting aspect of it. Now, a new partnership between Better Collective, its sports betting affiliate media Action Network, and the Post, indicate that this is indeed the case.</p>
<p>New York Post and Better Collective Chart a Joint Future in Sports Coverage</p>
<p>Moving forward, the New York Post will have the opportunity to benefit from Better Collective’s detailed breakdown of sports events, including data, unique content, statistics, and yes, a dedicated betting section.</p>
<p>The partnership is tailored to benefit both parties, with the New York Times reaching 92 million unique users, and hoping to continue developing its reach. Better Collective CEO Marc Pedersen commented on the new opportunity negotiated between the two companies:</p>
<p>“We believe that educating bettors and iGamers, by providing them with relevant information, data and statistics, will enhance their betting experience,” remarked Better Collective’s CEO Marc Pedersen.” Better Collective CEO Marc Pedersen</p>
<p>Better Collective is turning an important page as it enters mainstream media space, a bastion that was previously thought unbreachable, but has turned out to be welcoming to sports betting partnerships as legislation across the United States has passed to normalize gambling.</p>
<p>Pedersen is confident that the partnership would allow the company to reach a large audience of potential users as the New York Post has over 11 million readers in the State of New York alone. This comes shortly after the state legalized online sports betting and collected a record $150 million betting handle within the first week of the launch.</p>
<p>Push for Mainstream Media by Betting Companies</p>
<p>Better Collective, which acquired Action Network in 2021, has been a behemoth in the global sports betting industry and the company’s orchestrated efforts in the United States are beginning to pay off. Media is no stranger to such partnerships anymore. The New York Times bought The Athletic to boost its coverage in sports and also make a foray into sports betting coverage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, FanDuel has become the exclusive odds provider for the Associated Press and the media has been publishing a lot more gambling-related content that promotes picks and odds for sports contests. Commenting on the partnership between Better Collective and New York Post, the Post COO Brad Elders welcomed the opportunity and added:</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to bringing better sports betting content and utility to the best sports fans to continue our commitment to deliver unrivaled sports coverage.” New York Post COO Brad Elders</p>
<p>Elders is confident that Better Collective’s innovational tools and in-depth content would allow the Post readers to better navigate the fast-expanding betting landscape in the United States</p>
