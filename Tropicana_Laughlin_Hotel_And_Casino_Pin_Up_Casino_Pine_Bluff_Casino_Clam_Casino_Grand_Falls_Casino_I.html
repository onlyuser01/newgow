<p>At a time when artificial intelligence (AI) is feared as a potential killer of millions of white-collar jobs, the iGaming sector is fast adapting to implement relevant technical solutions and ensure that it delivers better products.</p>
<p>One of the good news from the mass use of AI comes from SOFTSWISS’ corner, a company that specializes in the delivery of various iGaming infrastructures. The company has reported that its Anti-Fraud team, part of the SOFTSIWSS’ Managed Services, has been able to save operators an estimated $18m (€16m) in 2022.</p>
<p>The cases in question concern some 61,810 requests which would have been impossible to analyze with manpower alone, which is where the company deployed its powerful AI to ensure that the Anti-Fraud team experts have the tools necessary to spot the attempts of fraud. Machine learning and AI have both gone into the development of a product that allows the company’s dedicated team to analyze suspicious cases and shield its partner operators.</p>
<p>The news comes amid a series of technological leaps at the core of SOFTSWISS, with the company’s Research and Development (R&amp;D) department also deploying a real-time data analysis tool that has made this level of scrutiny and security possible.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS has also been able to develop a way of better assessing the quality of affiliate traffic, which further strengthens the integrity of the iGaming environment, but also protects consumers from harm and improves commercial metrics for business partners.</p>
<p>The department has also built another tool called Business Metric Monitoring and Management (BM3) which is a quick and efficient way to troubleshoot problems and ensure that negative impacts on client businesses are nipped in the bud. Commenting on the company’s use of AI to strengthen its client offering, SOFTSWISS COO Vitali Matsukevich had this to say:</p>
<p>"AI is an effective tool for analyzing large data sets in real-time, but the final decision still should be left to an expert. While AI offers speed and efficiency, relying solely on AI for business decisions may not be advisable."</p>
<p>The company has also continued to develop other products, allowing AI to significantly strengthen the company’s capabilities in delivering outstanding content and product to partners. Amongst them is the DOSSIER feature which basically analyzes player behavior in order to offer tailored solutions and significantly improve the experience.</p>
<p>This news comes only recently after SOFTSWISS announced that it is deploying infrastructure in Latin America to help local partners have uninterrupted and reliable experience across the board.</p>
