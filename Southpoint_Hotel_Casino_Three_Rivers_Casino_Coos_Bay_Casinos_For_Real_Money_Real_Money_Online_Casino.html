<p>Bragg Gaming Group has announced a reshufflement of its executive structure with Matevž Mazij stepping into the role of Chief Executive Officer with immediate effect, and Yaniv Sherman, the hitherto incumbent, confirming his leave. Mazij is a gaming industry veteran who founded Oryx Gaming, the company that was acquired by Bragg Gaming Group in 2018 and is currently the largest shareholder in the parent company.</p>
<p>His experience as part of Oryx Gaming includes the creation of its original PAM, RGS gaming, and aggregation platforms, which quickly turned it into a gaming powerhouse, and a worthy addition to Bragg’s own sprawling portfolio. The change in leadership has been approved by the Board of Directors who welcomed Mazij’s appointment.</p>
<p>The company thanked Sherman for his extensive involvement and leadership in the company and hailed the arrival of Mazij in the new position. Mazij, said Lead Independent Director of the Board Holly Gagnon, was a seasoned industry veteran who has been accumulating a wealth of industry knowledge, and who is intimately familiar with Bragg’s structure and Oryx Gaming.</p>
<p>His significant contributions to shaping Oryx Gaming into what it is today are why Bragg feels confident that the company will continue to execute key strategic objectives and drive growth under Mazij's skilful leadership. Commenting on his appointment, the newly-appointed CEO had this to add:</p>
<p>"Following several years of serving on the Board, I am excited to return to an operational role to lead the Company towards continued top-line and cash-flow growth."</p>
<p>He spoke highly of the company and its opportunity to grow and expand in various markets, including Europe and North America, as well as other global markets that support iGaming as a fully-fledged entertainment activity.</p>
<p>Mazij added that he would be working with the company’s entire senior management and team members to ensure that Bragg reaches new milestones and continues to successfully deliver on all of its strategic objectives.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group has been delivering on a number of prominent milestones under Sherman’s stewardship and the now-former executive will be succeeded by a veteran who is equally keen to continue this track record. Bragg has recently expanded in the United Kingdom with Unibet and Ontario with another British brand, bet365.</p>
