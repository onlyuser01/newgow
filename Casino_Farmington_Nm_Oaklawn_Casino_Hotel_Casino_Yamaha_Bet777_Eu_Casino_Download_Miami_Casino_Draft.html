<p>DraftKings Casino in New Jersey has posted some juicy rewards over the last week, making history as it went</p>
<p>The casino has seen massive payouts go out to some lucky players, setting new records in the process. DraftKings said that two whopping jackpots worth millions of dollars were paid last week alone, putting the grand total of jackpots paid out to players since the company launched its progressive jackpot suite in the Garden State at $13.49 million.</p>
<p>Unlocking the Power of Jackpot</p>
<p>It was not just the amount won last week – but also the spectacular nature of some of those bets. One anonymous player managed to turn a $0.10 bet on Microgaming’s Ancient Fortunes: Zeus into a hefty $3.29 million payout, the biggest-ever jackpot win on a single game offered by DraftKings Casino in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The player’s decision to stick to the minimum betting limit has not stopped them from triggering the progressive jackpot and claiming it all the same. This win was not the only noteworthy amount won by a player over the course of the week, however. Another player managed to scoop $1.4 million on a $0.10 bet on 12 Western Horseshoes, the operator said.</p>
<p>The announcement has been made at a time of great importance to the operator. The company has been steadily pushing in the iGaming vertical in the United States, which has been gathering momentum, including in places such as New Jersey. The company is confident that it is now the leading iGaming entity in the United States in terms of gross gaming revenue, and it intends to remain so.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest developments, iGaming marketing &amp; operations VP Jason March said:</p>
<p>Crowning two millionaires in 24 hours was a monumental week for DraftKings Casino. The ability to give our customers the chance to win a big progressive jackpot on over 100 games makes me so proud of our product. DraftKings Jason March</p>
<p>Diving Deeper into US iGaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, DraftKings has been also gearing up with fresh content. The company recently launched its proprietary Auto American Live Roulette to offer a much better overall engagement with its audiences.</p>
<p>The game is available 24/7 and to players at the DraftKings Casino in New Jersey. The arrival of Auto American Live Roulette was hailed by the company as an important step forward in expanding the company’s efforts in the live casino vertical and revealing its own dedicated studio.</p>
<p>“Creating proprietary DraftKings Casino games has always been a core part of our strategy, and exclusive live casino games in this category will expand our reach even further,” the company said.</p>
