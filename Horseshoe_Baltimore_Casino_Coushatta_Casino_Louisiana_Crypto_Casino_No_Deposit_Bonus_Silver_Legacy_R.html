    <h1>Horseshoe Baltimore Casino Coushatta Casino Louisiana Crypto Casino No Deposit Bonus Silver Legacy R</h1>

<p>One of the world’s greatest game providers in the world, Pragmatic Play, will likely expand its Italian presence, thanks to an extended deal with a local partner that was recently signed. Today, the company announced that it has strengthened its relationship with Planetwin365, an Italian company that agreed to feature its Live Casino section.</p>
<p>Planetwin365 is operated by SKS365 gambling group and it is one of the leading online casinos on the Italian market, which has recorded a recent rise, especially in sports betting. This brand already features many of Pragmatic Play’s award-winning portfolio of online slots.</p>
<p>Planetwin365 Will Feature All of Pragmatic Play’s Live Games</p>
<p>The previous deal that was signed between these two parties had Planetwin365 featuring many of Pragmatic Play’s top-rated games such as Gates of Olympus, Sweet Bonanza and Wolf Gold. But, with the new contract extension, the online casino will now be able to provide all of the live games by the said provider. Some of the most popular live games by Pragmatic Play include the likes of Mega Wheel, Blackjack Azure, as well as several entertaining variants of roulette.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is looking to expand its presence and influence on the European market and the new deal with Planetwin365 is one of the partnerships that will contribute towards reaching the goal. Pragmatic Play’s Vice President of the Malta Operations, Lena Yassir, commented on the big announcement and stated that it is a massive achievement to have Pragmatic Play’s content at one of the leading Italian online casinos. Yassir also added that this exemplifies the type of growth that Pragmatic Play is looking for in the Italian online gambling market.</p>
<p>Yassir went on to say that the Planetwin365 partnership gives the provider the perfect exposure that it seeks for its live casino games and that there are no doubts that the games will be popular with Planetwin365’s players.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s Portfolio is Second to None, According to Troy Cox</p>
<p>The CCO of SKS365, Troy Cox, had massive praise for Pragmatic Play and stated that the provider’s portfolio is second-to-none when it comes to diversity and depth of quality. Cox added that the live games will be a major addition to Planetwin365’s game portfolio and will be popular with its players.</p>
<p>This deal wasn’t the only one that Pragmatic Play made to expand its European influence. Recently, it teamed up with StarGames and provided this operator with a focus on Germany with numerous quality slot games. StarGames is Greentube’s B2C arm.</p>
<p>Moreover, Pragmatic Play teamed up with the Spanish gambling brand Codere and with Dotworkers to expand its influence on the Latin American market. In doing so, it launched numerous products for that region, as well.</p>
