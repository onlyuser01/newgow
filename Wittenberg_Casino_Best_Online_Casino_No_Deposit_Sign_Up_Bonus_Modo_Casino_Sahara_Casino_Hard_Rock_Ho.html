<p>Nuvei and GoldBet have negotiated an extension of their partnership which will see the payment processing company feature even more banking methods on the betting and gaming website. Players will have the opportunity to use more of Nuvei’s available banking options to make quick cashouts and deposits at their leisure.</p>
<p>Nuvei and GoldBet Expand on Partnership</p>
<p>GoldBet has been innovating its payment gateway offer, ensuring to integrate trusted and familiar payment options for consumers to use. Thanks to Nuvei’s integration, GoldBet is expanding to feature other innovative options such as Apple Pay. The original partnership goes back to 2020, but the renewal enables consumers to have an even more impressive range of payment solutions at their fingertips.</p>
<p>GoldBet managing director for betting and digital in Italy, Alessandro Fiumara, welcomed the opportunity to be building upon the two companies’ successful relationship and add even more alternative gateways for consumers to enjoy.</p>
<p>Offering seamless deposits and withdrawals is key to making consumers feel at home and have the best gaming experience. Fiumara also praised the benefits the partnership has already yielded:</p>
<p>Since partnering with Nuvei, our revenues have grown significantly and we’re excited to continue this journey together. GoldBet managing director for betting and digital in Italy, Alessandro Fiumara</p>
<p>Nuvei chair and CEO Philip Fayer praised GoldBet’s presence in Italy and the significance for the gaming industry in the country. He added:</p>
<p>GoldBet is one of the leading gaming platforms in Italy because of its commitment to the player experience. Frictionless deposits and withdrawals, superior card acceptance rates, and a wide choice of preferred payment methods are all key. Nuvei chair and CEO Philip Fayer</p>
<p>Payment Convenience Crucial for Consumer Retention</p>
<p>Fayer assured that Nuvei will continue to deliver advanced payment services and solutions to digital businesses globally. He added that Nuvei is committed to working with businesses to ensure that their consumers’ needs are met and the available payment options reflect the needs of each particular operator.</p>
<p>By extending the available gateway of payment options, Nuvei and GoldBet are effectively ensuring that consumers will be more willing to engage, come back and enjoy their hobby frequently.</p>
<p>Most recently, the company teamed up with GAN to help the company boost its reach in the North American market and offer better solutions for players looking to carry out payments quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Nuvei also powered Hard Rock Digital’s payment options in May. This is all good news as a recent PayNearMe study has indicated that consumers are inclined to not participate in sports betting and iGaming sites if their payment options are not available.</p>
