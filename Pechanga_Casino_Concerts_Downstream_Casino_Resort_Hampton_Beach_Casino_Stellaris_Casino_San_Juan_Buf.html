<p>The latest partnership will ensure that the operator will continue to leverage SIS' premium greyhound racing content</p>
<p>The leading provider of content and supplier of live betting services, powering betting and gaming operators across the globe, Sports Information Services (SIS), announced a new multi-year partnership with the leading operator, Betfred. Announced Thursday, the new deal ensures that the operator will continue to have access to round-the-clock greyhound racing content covering competitions across the world.</p>
<p>The new long-term deal represents an extension of the successful partnership between Betfred and SIS. As a result, the operator will continue to leverage greyhound content, powering its retail and online offering with a wide range of greyhound racing events from markets such as Mexico, Ireland, as well as the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>This short-form content stands out with high quality and is proven to boost customer engagement. Moreover, the racing content from SIS positively impacts revenues, resulting in benefits for gambling operators. The latest deal complements Betfred’s commitment to offer engaging and thrilling experiences to its growing customer base. It is also a testament to the effectiveness and success of SIS’ 24/7 live racing content.</p>
<p>The partnership with SIS comes on the heels of another important collaboration announced by Betfred recently. This week, the company confirmed it extended its partnership with the top-flight rugby league in the UK and Europe, the Super League. As a result of that partnership, Betfred will retain the role of sponsor of the league for three more years.</p>
<p>SIS, Pleased to Continue Its Partnership with Betfred</p>
<p>Craig Reid, Betfred’s group trading director, spoke about the deal with SIS, pointing out that it allows the operator to deliver supreme experiences for fans of greyhound racing. “Our partnership with SIS is of great value and we’re thrilled to be able to ensure we provide our customers with unmatched betting opportunities around the clock,” he explained in conclusion.</p>
<p>“This extended agreement enables us to maintain our commitment to delivering superior content from the world’s best greyhound races to our customers.“ Craig Reid, group trading director at Betfred</p>
<p>Richard Ames, SIS’ chief executive, revealed that the company is delighted to continue its successful partnership with Betfred and continue to deliver its premium greyhound racing content. He spoke about the operator’s strong position in the market, confirming that it is also one of the long-term partners of SIS. Finally, Ames said that the company remains committed to delivering quality and comprehensive racing content for operators and players across the globe.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased that we have ensured the continued presence of our premium greyhound racing in the product portfolio of a key long-term partner.“ Richard Ames, chief executive at SIS</p>
<p>Recently, SIS confirmed its plans for expansion in strategic markets across Africa via a deal with the leading provider of services, solutions and technology, Aardvark Technologies.</p>
