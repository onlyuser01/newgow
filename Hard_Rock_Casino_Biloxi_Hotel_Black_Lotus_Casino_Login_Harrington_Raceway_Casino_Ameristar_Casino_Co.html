    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Hotel Black Lotus Casino Login Harrington Raceway Casino Ameristar Casino Co</h1>

<p>I discussed this case even with our Complaints department today. It's complicated, but I'll try to explain it. I agree they should stick to the terms and conditions. The question is - why didn't we punish them? The approach was following: If the player mentioned the gambling problem / addiction, then it would be clear that the casino harmed the player by allowing her to reopen the account on the next day since it's their duty to protect the player against losing money due to their addiction when they're aware of the fact that the player is addicted to gambling.</p>
<p>In the case we had, the gambling problem wasn't mentioned. It means that the self-exclusion didn't work as it supposed to work. It was a bad user experience for the player and I agree with it. On the other hand, the player didn't ask us to decide whether is was a bad user experience, but the player asked for a refund. In that case, it's difficult to find support for the refund since based on the info we have, the player's mental condition is fine and we have a reason to believe that the player knew what she was doing when she lost the money on gambling.</p>
