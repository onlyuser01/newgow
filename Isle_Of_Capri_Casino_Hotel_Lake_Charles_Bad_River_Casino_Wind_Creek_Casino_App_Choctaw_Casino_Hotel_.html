<p>Two of the juveniles broke into and burglarized the vehicles at the 1900 Pacific Ave. parking facility, police said.</p>
<p>They attempted to steal the cars, but were unsuccessful. In the process, they damaged steering columns, police said.</p>
<p>One of the teens had a USB cable in his possession. It is known to be frequently used as a tool when stealing Kia and Hyundai cars, police revealed. The second teen had a screwdriver with him. Thieves sometimes use screwdrivers to turn on vehicle ignitions and break steering columns.</p>
<p>Detectives located the boys walking in the Connecticut and Wabash Avenues in Atlantic City last Friday night. The boys were stopped by Atlantic City detectives Christopher Dodson, Alberto Valles, Eric Evans, and Troy Grams.</p>
<p>Charges</p>
<p>The two teens were charged with three counts each of burglary and criminal mischief. They also were charged with possession of burglar tools.</p>
<p>The two were released to the custody of their parents. They are scheduled to appear in local court.</p>
<p>A third teen was found to be holding stolen credit cards. He was charged with receiving stolen property and was given a summons to appear in local court. The credit cards had been stolen from a car, police said.</p>
<p>Word of their arrests was announced by the Atlantic City Police Department on Wednesday.</p>
<p>None of the suspects was identified by the police because of their ages.</p>
<p>Free Wheel Locks</p>
<p>Given these break-ins and other recent car burglaries, the Atlantic City Police Department announced that it is distributing free steering wheel locks to Hyundai and Kia owners this week.</p>
<p>The distribution is part of an ongoing effort by Atlantic City cops to curb Kia and Hyundai car thefts.</p>
<p>These vehicles continue to be the most popular cars and SUVs for car thieves, particularly younger individuals,” Atlantic City police said in a recent statement.</p>
<p>To get the steering wheel locks, owners of these brands of cars who live in Atlantic City can use their affected vehicles or a copy of their car registration and driver’s license. They must bring those to the Clayton G. Graham Public Safety Building at 2715 Atlantic Ave., Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Local police will provide owners of these auto brands a free lock between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays.</p>

<p>Nationally, teenagers are increasingly finding information online on how to steal cars, such as on TikTok. They may use them for joy rides, or as a getaway vehicle for another crime, such as robberies, according to The New York Times.</p>
