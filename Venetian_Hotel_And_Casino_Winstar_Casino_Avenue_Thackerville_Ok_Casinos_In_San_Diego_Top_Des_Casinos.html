<p>Going live with the brand in Switzerland marks the latest collaboration for the iGaming developer in the country and allows to expand the reach of its games to new audiences</p>
<p>The content-driven provider of iGaming technology, services, solutions and games, powering the regulated retail and online gambling sector, Bragg Gaming Group, unveiled details regarding a new collaboration, allowing it to continue its European-facing expansion. On Wednesday, the company revealed that under an agreement with the leading Swiss operator, Casino Lugano, it expanded its position within the regulated gambling market in the country.</p>
<p>As a result, Bragg’s content has gone live with the operator’s Swiss4Win brand, delivering thrilling and engaging games. The new collaboration complements the growth of the iGaming developer in the country. In fact, it marks the sixth such partnership in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest deal, Swiss4Win’s customers will be able to access a portfolio of games provided by Bragg. Such will include high-performing fan-favorite titles from its brands Atomic Slot Lab and Bragg Studios, including titles like Egyptian Magic, Dreamy Genie and Fairy Dust, among others.</p>
