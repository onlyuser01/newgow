    <h1>Santa Fe Hotel Casino Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Toledo The Mirage Casino Casinos Southern Califor</h1>

<p>Thank you for getting in touch with us.</p>
<p>Firstly, in respect of the Terms and Conditions of the Casino, we must inform you that they are available to all players when creating an account and come into force the moment the player clicked accept when the account was created. This is an agreement and turns into a fully functioning, legally binding contract upon creation of the account.</p>
<p>We understand that Oliver has made a complaint regarding the decision made by the Casino and his voided winnings. Please be advised that Oliver's winnings were voided due to irregular play.</p>
<p>The Casino also expects all potential players to read all the terms and conditions. Oliver's winnings were voided for breaking the 30% Rule.</p>

<p>9.1. Winnings and Betting Rules</p>
<p>9.1.1. A player must bet while taking into consideration the rules of the game he is on.</p>
<p>9.1.2. Irregular play</p>
<p>The Casino has the prerogative to refuse any withdrawal request, which includes the right to remove all bonuses or winnings in the case of Irregular Play. The following are deemed irregular play:</p>
<p>9.1.2.1. Real Money (deposit) Betting Rules:</p>
<p>Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the smallest deposit currently in play. This includes purchasing in-game features including but not limited to free spins with a total bet amount of 30% or greater than the value of the deposit.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>In Oliver's case, the deposit in play is a deposit of 30 Euro.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the Terms and Conditions of the Casino, Oliver is unable to bet more than or equal to 9 Euros.</p>
<p>According to his game-play, he has made more than 100 over-bets ranging from €10 to €450 on the game Blackjack Surrender - this is the reason why the winnings were voided.</p>
<p>We understand Oliver's frustration, but, since he broke Terms and Conditions, therefore, his winnings have been voided.</p>
<p>The finance team has already refunded Oliver's non-lost deposit of 30 EUR according to the terms and we confirm the deposit was refunded successfully.</p>
