<p>Following the removal of in-person registration, PointsBet has become one of the sports betting firms in Iowa to roll out a dedicated mobile app.</p>
<p>PointsBet Ups the Ante on Mobile Sports Betting with an App</p>
<p>PointsBet has launched its mobile sports betting app officially in Iowa, following the state’s approval to allow remote registration for all wagering, and a plan to relax taxation. The app rolled out for both iOS and Android consumers and supports the full variety of markets available to sports bettors in the state.</p>
<p>Die-hard sports fans have been able to download and install the app from the Google Play and Apple Store since January 1. The app comes with all the bells and whistles of the desktop sportsbook, including a dedicated $1,000 risk-free bundle offer, which comes with numerous ways to offset potential losses and maximize your sports betting experience.</p>
<p>Commenting about the launch, PointsBet USA CEO Johnny Aitken has commended the efforts the company’s team has been putting in the state of Iowa, and the brand’s brick-and-mortar partners from Catfish Bend Casino.</p>
<p>“We both are tremendously excited for what is effectively a second launch of Iowa sports betting with remote registration now in play,” the chief executive added.</p>
<p>He didn’t miss to commend PointsBet’s excellent mobile app and digital sports betting product, lauding the features and betting options that together add up to a wholesome experience for U.S. sports fans.</p>
<p>“We believe the great folks in the Hawkeye State will love what PointsBet has to offer and certainly look forward to the interest and feedback to come,” he said with Iowa continuing to clock in convincing sports betting results.</p>
<p>PointsBet claims to be the only U.S. sports betting operator that hosts a unique variety of wagering options granting on-demand wishes for special bets as well as awarding players exponentially based on “the more correct or incorrect” wagers they place, a press release explained.</p>
<p>Inevitable Growth in Iowa</p>
<p>The sportsbook has been on an upward trajectory in the Hawkeye State since it launched in August 2019 with the help of its brick-and-mortar partner at Catfish Bend Casino.</p>
<p>While the mobile and online sports offer is clearly in focus, the casino itself has some excellent options to offer, including a dedicated smoke-free 5,600 square feet sports betting lounge equipped with 35 televisions and other recreational facilities.</p>
<p>Apart from the betting kiosks, you can benefit from a 163″ inch TV set allowing you to follow all big events and share in the joy of your fellow punters. Commenting on the partnership so far, Catfish Bend Casino General Manager Rob Higgins said that the alliance has been beneficial to the property, with the casino enjoying interest from mobile and in-person bettors.</p>
<p>Having the added benefit of launching a mobile app is another advantage that both Catfish and sports fans can enjoy, he noted, promising that PointsBet would not be disappointed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, William Hill has also launched a dedicated mobile app in the state, solidifying its presence there. Later this year, 888 Holdings is expected to go ahead with a sportsbook and mobile app of its own.</p>
