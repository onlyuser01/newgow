<p>CCRI will provide higher education and economic opportunities to students who wish to pursue a career in the casino and gaming industries</p>
<p>Yesterday, Bally’s Corporation unveiled a $5 million donation to the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) Foundation. In line with the long-term partnership between the two bodies, the donation celebrates the Foundation’s 45-year history.</p>
<p>The money will help the CCRI Foundation provide higher education and economic opportunities to students who wish to pursue a career in the casino and gaming industries. Bally’s employees who wish to improve their skill sets will also be able to benefit from the donation.</p>
<p>The investment will cement CCRI as the only higher education institution in Rhode Island to offer certificates and associate degrees based on a comprehensive gaming-focused curriculum. The program will include classroom classes, online lessons, on-campus learning labs and opportunities to work at a Bally’s property.</p>
<p>Courses include dealer training, casino operations, cybersecurity, iGaming operations, culinary arts, hotel management and slot technology. The first programs are expected to be available by fall 2024.</p>
<p>The college’s Division of Workforce Partnerships, meanwhile, will launch short-term credentials to help existing Bally’s workers add to their talents.</p>
<p>Finally, Bally’s investment will provide scholarships to qualifying locals who wish to pursue a career in the growing gaming and hospitality industries. The company promised to reveal more details soon.</p>
<p>The Announcement Was Attended by Notable Representatives</p>
<p>The partnership was announced during an event on CCRI’s Flanagan Campus, attended by multiple notable individuals. Bally’s chairman, Soo Kim, commented on the matter, expressing his team’s excitement to join forces with CCRI.</p>
<p>While this donation is the latest milestone in our long-term partnership with CCRI, we look forward to supporting this program for many years to come, creating a legacy of economic opportunity. Soo Kim, chair, Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>Governor Daniel McKee also attended the event, praising the “landmark partnership” between Bally’s and CCRI. He applauded Bally’s for investing in the higher education system and the Rhode Island students.</p>
<p>CCRI interim president Dr Rosemary A. Costigan added that the “remarkable gift” is a great recognition of CCRI’s track record in expanding new programs and degree pathways for students.</p>
<p>Our partnership brings attention to the unparalleled value of community colleges and their powerful role in the region’s economy, and I am grateful for Bally’s belief in us and our incredible students. Dr Rosemary A. Costigan, interim president, CCRI</p>
<p>Finally, CCRI president Dr Meghan Hughes said that the contribution marks an “extraordinary moment in the college’s history.” She noted that the deal signifies the transformative power of education and industry collaboration.</p>
