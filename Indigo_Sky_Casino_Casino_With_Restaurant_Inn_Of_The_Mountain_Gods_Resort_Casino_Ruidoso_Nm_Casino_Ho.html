    <h1>Indigo Sky Casino Casino With Restaurant Inn Of The Mountain Gods Resort Casino Ruidoso Nm Casino Ho</h1>

<p>At the end of November 2020 I signed up for CasinoExtreme as their instant cash outs were very much what I think should be expected. Shortly after I opened my account I spoke to support, got the info, and sent in my verification documents. They confirmed and congratulated me on being verified for instant withdrawal. Meanwhile/shortly after I redeemed a bonus or two and a no deposit bonus along with several non bonus deposits all totaling several hundred dollars. On my last deposit not attached to a bonus I shot up over 1k and played a while longer before initiating a cashout.</p>
<p>NOVEMBER 30 2020 is the date they confirmed I initiated the cashout.</p>
<p>"This email confirms our receipt of your payout request via Bitcoin, for the amount of $900.00, for your Casino Extreme Account: ..... To finalize your payout, please reply to this email with the crypto address you requested your withdrawal ."</p>
<p>i replies but the excitement didn’t last, shortly after, instead of my winnings, I was met with a locked Casino account and this email</p>
<p>"We are contacting you regarding your latest withdrawal request.</p>
<p>Your account has went under the review by upper management due to your accounts similarity with other players. Please note that all this is done in accordance with the terms of service posted on our website and here, you may check that out:"</p>
<p>I still don’t understand what this means as they received and verified all my unique documents and I’do no have more accounts. I reached out to support who assured me this is just a formality and management will reach out to me shortly with an update...... Not a single time since have they messaged me an update or explained wtf was going on and why it was taking so long. Instead I have to send emails weekly and each receives the same generic "management is working quickly to resolve this issue and will get in touch"</p>
<p>I feel I was extremely patient and gave them more than enough time but it’s obvious they aren’t actually doing any investigation and just hoped I’d give up. Well that’s BS and I didn’t risk hundreds of dollars just to get shafted and then completely and disrespectfully blown off like nothing...</p>
<p>so yeah ...King of instant withdrawals my ass-urances are worthless and it’s time to pay the man his winnings.</p>
