    <h1>Mandalay Bay Resort Casino Hawaiian Gardens Casino Casino Party Rentals Boomtown Casino Hotel Woody</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and for taking the time to look into it for me. My main concern was that their live chat isn't available between 2am and 7am, and when contacting via email at 6am I didn't receive a reply until 8:30. I think 2.5 hours is far too long a delay for a problem gambler who wants to close their account or even self exclude for a short period. Given that you work with gamblers a lot you probably know quite well that a problem gambler on tilt can lose a lot of money in 2.5 hours. The principles of self exclusion don't work when there is that much delay involved. I'm sure the casino is well aware of this fact, because it would be extremely simple to put in a button where gamblers can self exclude themselves (like on most other ethical casinos).</p>
<p>The deposit limit is of no use if you already have a lot of money on your account, and a reality check has little effect on a gambler on tilt.</p>
<p>I requested the account closure and they have closed it now (2.5 hours after I requested it). They also sent me my spin history (after initially refusing), but it took me threatening to complain to the top gambling review sites before they sent it.</p>
<p>Overall I think Casino Guru is a really great site that helps gamblers to separate the good casinos from the bad, however I don't think 8.6 is a deserving score for a casino that engages is such shady practices. Its clear they are only interested in meeting the absolute minimum requirements set by the MGA, and have no true interest in enabling problem gamblers to limit their gambling. Giving them an 8.6 is a disservice to the other casinos with similar scores who actually make it easy to self exclude or close an account</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help,</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Gene</p>
