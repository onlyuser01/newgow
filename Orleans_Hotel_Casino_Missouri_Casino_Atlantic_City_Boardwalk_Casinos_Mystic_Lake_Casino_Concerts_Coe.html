<p>Spinomenal continues to double down on its Bulgarian footprint with the acclaimed supplier of more than 300 HTML5 games signing a new partnership with local player ELITE.bg. Thanks to this tie-up, Spinomenal will help ELITE consolidate its presence in the local Bulgarian iGaming market, following a similar partnership with WINBET in September.</p>
<p>ELITE already operates in several verticals in the jurisdiction, and it has established itself as a major stakeholder in sports, virtual sports, and electronic sports, meeting big local demand. As to the casino’s gaming library, it will now grow with distinct titles provided by Spinomenal, which include popular choices such as Majestic Winter, 1 Reel Demi Gods II, Wolf Fang, and more.</p>
<p>ELITE.bg CEO Viktor Kirilov welcomed this opportunity and effused about the chance to be a part of this collaborative effort. "We are delighted that our partnership is now a fact," Kirilov added. He spoke of ELITE’s own standing in the local market and how the operator has been actively growing its proposition locally.</p>
<p>The addition of Spinomenal will now create more opportunities for the brand and establish ELITE as a recognizable name in the gambling industry both in Bulgaria, but also in Eastern Europe. As to Spinomenal, the company was happy with CEO Lior Shvartz commenting on this chance and saying that the supplier has had a good track record in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>"Our games will sit perfectly within ELITBET.bg’s online casino offering and help them continue to provide exceptional gaming experiences," Shvartz added. Spinomenal has been rapidly scaling its offer not just in Bulgaria, but well beyond that.</p>
<p>The supplier recently teamed up with Bragg Gaming Group and joined the company’s aggregation solution, with a particular focus on high-value regulated markets such as the Netherlands, Croatia, Romania, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Spinomenal has also been pushing up the pace of its own in-house studio development with the arrival of Queen of Elements and Story of Jarptitsa just recently. Spinomenal has been focused on European growth and upping the quality of its own titles by providing fresh gamification features and opportunities to partner operators and players.</p>
