<p>Gilbert Burns Going for a Submission Win</p>
<p>Gilbert Burns is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert who’s got a number of BJJ gold medals in his collection, including the one for the 2011 World Jiu-Jitsu Championship in which he defeated Kron Gracie of the legendary Gracie family.</p>
<p>It was 2012 when Burns started his MMA career, while simultaneously competing in submission grappling tournaments. Over the years, he’s developed striking skills, while further polishing his grappling and wrestling ability. As a result, he’s now one of the most well-rounded fighters in the UFC Welterweight division.</p>
<p>Still, against Masvidal, it’s very likely he’ll focus on grappling. Why? Because that’s something his opponent isn’t great at. Instead, Gamebred’s strongest weapon is striking.</p>
<p>Jorge Masvidal To Give His Utmost in His Hometown</p>
<p>Jorge Masvidal cannot outwrestle Burns; the only way to beat this guy is to punch his way to victory. Masvidal is an expert striker who’s got a 45.71% knockout-to-win ratio. However, it’s been a while since he defeated someone in the Octagon.</p>
<p>He’s 0-3 since 2019, and his most recent win happened against Nate Diaz after a controversial doctor stoppage in the BMF title fight. Truth be told, he was winning that fight even before the TKO ruling.</p>
<p>But after that fight, he lost the next three. Kamaru Usman beat him twice in the battle for the championship belt, while in his most recent fight, Masvidal lost to Colby Covington. Usman beat him once by KO and once by decision, while the loss to Covington happened by decision. In all three fights, Masvidal suffered a lot of takedowns – 13 in total. In his last fight, Covington recorded 6 takedowns against him.</p>
<p>It’s been over a year since that fight, so you can be 100% certain Masvidal’s been training hard to improve his takedown defense. But will that be good enough against Burns?</p>
<p>Gilbert Burns vs. Jorge Masvidal Prediction</p>
<p>Jorge Masvidal is tough as nails, so you can be certain he won’t let Burns submit his easily. This goes especially given that the fight is taking place on his turf. Miami is Masvidal’s hometown, and the crowd is going to be on his side. That said, we expect Gamebred to fight to the final bell. But we doubt that’s going to be enough for him to win.</p>
<p>Pick: Gilbert Burns to win by decision</p>
