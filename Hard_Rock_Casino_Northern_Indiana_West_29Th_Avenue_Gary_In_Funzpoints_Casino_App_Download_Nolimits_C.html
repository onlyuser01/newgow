    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Northern Indiana West 29Th Avenue Gary In Funzpoints Casino App Download Nolimits C</h1>

<p>Dear Paternó,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Casino Guru. I'm sorry to hear that you've been having difficulties with cashing out your winnings. If I understand you correctly, you won $1450 without playing with a bonus, requested withdrawal and then played with the free spins. The casino cancelled your withdrawal and confiscated your winnings of $1450 and gave you $150 back, is that correct? I found the rule in the casino’s T&amp;Cs:</p>
<p>"25. Players with one or more pending withdrawals currently in their account are not eligible to receive any bonuses, promotional or otherwise, until such withdrawals are either processed or cancelled. Abuse of this policy, as defined by the casino, may result in cancellation of the player's winnings"</p>
<p>We find this rule a little bit odd, but the casino can set their own rules regarding offered bonuses. However, the casino shouldn’t confiscate the winnings earned by playing real money. Are you sure you won the $1450 without playing with a bonus?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Peter</p>
