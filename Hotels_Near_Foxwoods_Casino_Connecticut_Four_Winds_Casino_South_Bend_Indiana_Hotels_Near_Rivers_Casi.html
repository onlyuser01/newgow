<p>FA Signs a Record-Breaking Broadcast Deal for WSL</p>
<p>The FA has inked the biggest broadcast deal for professional women’s soccer league in the world. The association has signed a multi-million partnership deal for broadcast rights to the Women’s Super League (WSL) with BBC and Sky Sports for the 2021-22 season.</p>
<p>Each of the three years would be worth around £8 million. The money will be split into two. A part of it will go to refereeing development. The rest of the money will go to the WSL and the Championship. The WSL will receive 75% of the money, and the Championship will receive 25%. Some of the funding for WSL is going to be awarded to the teams based on merit.</p>
<p>While taking the Premier League’s scheduling into account, there are ongoing time slots consultations with the clubs. The 1st pick is on Sunday at 12:30 pm, the 2nd is on Saturday at 11:30 am, the 3rd on Sunday at 6:30 pm, and the 4th on Friday at 6:30 pm.</p>
<p>Sky Sports will show up to 44 live games and broadcast on its Sky Sports Main Event. The BBC will put 18 of their 22 games on BBC One and BBC Two.</p>
<p>A Landmark Moment for Women’s Soccer</p>
<p>FA’s director of the women’s professional game, Kelly Simmons, said that “this a landmark moment for the women’s game, and a breakthrough for women’s sports and women’s soccer.” She also stated that media rights are one of the main drivers behind the revenue growth in professional sports and soccer.</p>
<p>The managing director of Sky Sports, Robert Webster, promised the Women’s Super League “the full Sky Sports treatment.” He said that there would be long buildups, a daily narrative of the league on all Sky Sports News and digital platforms, and reaction to all live matches.</p>
<p>The FA’s director of commercial and marketing, Kathryn Swarbrick, stated that FA is going to work hand-in-hand with Sky Sports. She expects the company to drive awareness of WSL. Swarbrick said that Sky Sports would build a profile of the players and the clubs, create exciting content for the fast, and provide a broad pre-and post-match commentary and story-telling for the women’s league.</p>
<p>BBC Sports director Barbara Slater stated that this is fantastic for women’s soccer. She said that BBC Sports is happy to give an air platform for the league to connect with an audience that will be as wide as possible.</p>
