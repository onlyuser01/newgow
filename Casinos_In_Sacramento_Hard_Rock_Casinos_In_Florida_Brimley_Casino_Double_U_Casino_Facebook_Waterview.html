    <h1>Casinos In Sacramento Hard Rock Casinos In Florida Brimley Casino Double U Casino Facebook Waterview</h1>

<p>Hello and happy New Year :)</p>
<p>also very nice work you do here :)</p>
<p>iI would like to describe my situation with the Bruno Casino and ask if its something you saw before and if there is a way to solve this.</p>
<p>I registered at Bruno casino. Drivers Licence and Skrill account was verified.</p>
<p>The problem is with the address. I accidentally used the address of the place i grew up. The name of the city. Actually it's name of village, name of city, providence. The village just outside of the closest major city I used as my address. i was born in the city and lived in this village very close to the city. I come at the village very often on holidays and weekends. When i order something online i use the name of the city as pickup point cause no couriers come to the village thats why i accidentally used this one as my address when i registered.Here is the house of my parents where i grew up and lives since about 6 years ago when i moved to another city for work. I rent a house in another city.</p>
<p>The problem is that i accidentally used as address the name of the closest city, when i registered my account at bruno casino. As all casinos do they requested verification of the address. Thats ok and good thing to do on their part of verification. But i don't have any of the papers they ask on my name from the address I used accidentally when I registered (proof of address of your old address - any utility bill (gas, water, landline or mobile phone, electricity), a tax invoice) all those papers are on my parents names.</p>
<p>I have other papers that show name of the village and the city (i don't know how u call them in english though :D) the tax paper shows that the Public Financial Service is in the city. That my address is the village which is just outside of the city. My id shows the city as my birthplace and the village as my address. ID was issued back in 1999.i also have another paper which i don't know if it can be used as verification of old address so bruno casino can change it to my new one. its my marriage certificate from the government. it states clearly my old address. Almost all the papers show my social security number and the AFM (personal Tax Identification Number</p>
<p>). Itâ€™s the same on all. All papers are connected, if someone sees them, numbers places etc</p>
<p>Almost forgot: i have winnings at that casino of 1400 euros which i cant withdraw.i used skrill as deposit method and same skrill to withdraw but of course got rejected since there is issue with the address.</p>
<p>So, thats my story :D if u want more info feel free to ask me.</p>
<p>I just want to know if there is some other way to verify the address I used accidentally, when I registered to the casino and register my new one, so I will be able to withdraw and continue playing in this casino.</p>
