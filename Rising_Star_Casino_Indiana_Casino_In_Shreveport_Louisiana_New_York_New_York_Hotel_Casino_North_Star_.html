    <h1>Rising Star Casino Indiana Casino In Shreveport Louisiana New York New York Hotel Casino North Star</h1>

<p>Daniel Negreanu has signed on to be a member of Team , and the site is celebrating with a $100K tournament.</p>
<p>Team GGPoker Welcomes Daniel Negreanu</p>
<p>GG Poker just keeps getting more and more popular among online poker players around the world, and it’s about to get even more high profile. Poker superstar Daniel Negreanu has signed on to be an ambassador for the brand, as reported by a post on Twitter yesterday.</p>
<p>I have a BIG announcement to make! Details in the video below: pic.twitter.com/1xDTkglYmD — Daniel Negreanu (@RealKidPoker) November 20, 2019</p>
<p>While Negreanu’s post attracted plenty of congratulations from his peers, there was also plenty of criticism. Many players chimed in about GGPoker’s high rake and, in the case of PLO games, unlimited rake. However, he has yet to respond to those comments.</p>
<p>The last time Negreanu entered into a sponsorship deal with an online poker company, it was in 2007. He joined up with Team PokerStars and remained an ambassador for the company for 12 years. It was only just before the WSOP 2019 that he announced he would be leaving the team.</p>
<p>It was thought that Negreanu would head over to partypoker, like other pros who have left Team PokerStars, but he decided to sign on with a much newer brand – and he’ll be joining a roster full of poker Twitch streamers. Although GGPoker is a relatively new name in the online poker world, the company is experiencing tremendous growth. In his Twitter post, Negreanu mentioned that the site is giving away $50 million guarantees, a huge jump from $3 million the year before.</p>
<p>Another reason Negreanu has joined Team GG is the software. He says that the mobile client is “super user-friendly, fun and engaging”. It’s a sentiment that has been echoed by online poker players across the web, as GGPoker’s software is quickly becoming one of the favourite poker platforms.</p>
<p>However, GGPoker still isn’t as well-known as household names like PokerStars and partypoker. The site does attract a lot of traffic but doesn’t have that name brand recognition yet. But, with Daniel Negreanu on board, the company could become a big player in the online poker world soon.</p>
<p>A Chance to Play Live with Daniel Negreanu</p>
<p>To celebrate Negreanu joining the team, GGPoker will be holding the $100,000 Guaranteed Daniel Negreanu Challenge. The players who qualify for the tournament will be able to join Kid Poker himself on the felt and compete for their share of a $100,000 prize pool.</p>
<p>The qualifying tournaments will start on November 30, and the first one will be free to enter. Buy-ins for the rest of the events will range from $5 to $100 – which isn’t a bad price for the chance to play with one of the best poker players in the world.</p>
