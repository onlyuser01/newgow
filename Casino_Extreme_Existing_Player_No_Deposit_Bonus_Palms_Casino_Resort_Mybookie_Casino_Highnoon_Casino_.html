<p>A middle school teacher is accused of an attempted sexual assault at Niagara Falls’ Seneca Niagara Resort and Casino last February. The defendant, Brian H. Lasher, is scheduled to appear in Niagara Falls, N.Y. City Court next month.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old Amherst, N.Y. resident also was placed on leave from his job as a middle school physical education teacher.</p>
<p>Lasher was charged with a third-degree criminal sex act, third-degree attempted rape, and third-degree sex abuse. That’s according to Niagara Falls City Administrator Anthony J. Restaino, quoted by the Buffalo News, a regional newspaper. If convicted, Lasher could face several years in prison.</p>
<p>The alleged crime took place on Feb. 8, 2021.</p>
<p>Few other details were released about the alleged crime. The victim was described as an adult.</p>
<p>Not Guilty Plea</p>
<p>Lasher has pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released under the supervision of probation officials. He will next appear in court on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Lasher and co-defendant John R. Scholl Jr., 39, have been arraigned in connection with the case, Niagara County Assistant District Attorney Peter Wydysh told the News. Scholl also pleaded not guilty in the case.</p>
<p>The unnamed victim was given a protection order by a local judge, the Post reported. That will likely prevent the defendants from contacting or visiting the victim.</p>
<p>Teacher on Administrative Leave</p>
<p>Lasher was placed on immediate administrative leave from Starpoint Middle School, where he taught for over 32 years, Starpoint Central School District Superintendent of Schools Sean M. Croft informed parents in a letter.</p>
<p>No students or staff were involved in the incident, nor did it take place on district property, the letter reveals.</p>
<p>School officials learned of the incident from the police. Education officials then took administrative action.</p>
<p>Based on the serious nature of the allegations, Mr. Lasher was placed on administrative leave immediately,” the letter adds. “The district will continue to make the safety of its students and staff its utmost priority. The district is not able to comment further at this time as it is a personnel matter.”</p>
<p>Lasher could not be reached for immediate comment, the Post adds. It is unclear which attorney is representing him on the charges.</p>
