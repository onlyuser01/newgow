<p>The lawsuit seeks damages, alleging that the casino shouldn’t hold Manley responsible for the money he has spent while under the influence of a potent drug</p>
<p>Dwight Manley, a 57-year-old real estate executive and a prominent high roller, is taking MGM Resorts to court. According to him, a spiked drink caused him to lose adequacy and wager away two million dollars. Manley alleges that the MGM staff did nothing to prevent his losses other than offering him credit.</p>
<p>Manley, a long-time customer of the MGM brand, visited the MGM Grand property in Las Vegas in 2021 after receiving an invitation to stay in the MGM Mansion. On December 10, the lawsuit says, Manley ordered a cocktail that had a suspicious “bitter” taste. After a second cocktail, the real estate executive began to feel “out of it” and act erratically.</p>
<p>Feeling disoriented, Manley broke an ashtray, cutting his hand. The lawsuit alleges that the casino staff provided him with band-aids and moved him to another table but did not offer any further medical help.</p>
<p>At that point, Manley was clearly not feeling well and yet he was offered a line credit of up to $3.5 million, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, Manley collapsed in his villa. He later tested himself in California, with medical tests showing that he had ketamine in his system.</p>
<p>Manley Is Committed to Finding the Perpetrator</p>
<p>In addition to launching a lawsuit, Manley has hired the services of a private investigator. At the same time, Manley is seeking further info on www.Reward4InfoCasinoDrugging.com where anyone with any information can provide a report. The real estate executive promises a reward of $500,000 to anyone who can help him identify the perpetrators.</p>
<p>In his lawsuit, Manley also highlighted the dangers of ketamine, which could have put his life in danger. Because of that, he has also involved the Las Vegas Metro Police and the Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks damages, alleging that the casino shouldn’t hold Manley responsible for the money he has spent while under the influence of a potent drug.</p>
<p>For reference, ketamine is an anesthetic primarily used in veterinary medicine but has recently gained traction as a drug. Overdosing on ketamine is reported to cause a severe dissociative state.</p>
