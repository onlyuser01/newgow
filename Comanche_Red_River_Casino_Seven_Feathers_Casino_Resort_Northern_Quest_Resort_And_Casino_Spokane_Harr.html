<p>While concerns about gambling harm continue to grow in Australia, a major reform may mark the start of a change in a positive direction. NSW Labor was previously skeptical about a proposal that calls for cashless gaming cards in an effort to curb problem gambling and fight money laundering.</p>
<p>NSW Labor Plans Changes to Gambling</p>
<p>Now, a new report by the Australian Associated Press reveals that NSW Labor would back a year-long cashless gaming card trial if they win the state elections. The elections are planned for this March and according to NSW Labor leader Chris Minns, if his party wins the elections, they would support major changes to the gambling regulation.</p>
<p>Such changes are expected to include a trial for cashless gaming cards. This trial is expected to last for 12 months starting in July this year. Considering the trial nature, not all gambling venues will participate but instead, the cashless gaming card will be implemented for no less than 500 machines. Besides central, there will be regional venues that will be participating in the trial. The process itself is going to be scrutinized by a separate body consisting of gambling health professionals, law enforcement officers and scientists.</p>
<p>Another important change that is implemented is that the NSW Labor party will no longer accept donations from clubs that offer pokie machines. According to the NSW Labor leader, that change is already in effect as of Monday and if the party wins the election, the regulation would be signed into law.</p>
<p>Additional changes that Minns’ party would support if they win the election would be a decrease in the deposit limits. Currently, the cash-in deposit limit for pokies is set at AU$ 5,000 ($3,485). That limit, if the NSW Labor wins in March, is expected to be reduced to AU$500 ($349) starting from July.</p>
<p>Trial Unlikely to Be Effective</p>
<p>Recently, NSW whistleblower Troy Stolz unveiled plans to challenge Minns for his marginal seat of Kogarah. Stolz, who was a financial auditor criticized Minns for not taking a stricter position against gambling and not entirely supporting the cashless gaming card proposal. What’s more, he claimed that Minns was backed up by pubs and clubs and worked against the interests of the public.</p>
<p>Similarly, Cate Faehrmann, Greens MP, was skeptical about the proposed trial of cashless gaming cards. She explained that this was far from an effective solution, considering that crime organizations that do money laundering or problem gamblers can simply avoid the venues that are taking part in the cashless gaming trial. Faehrmann predicted that this trial will be harmful to jobs and businesses. Ultimately, according to her, the trial aims to prove that the proposal doesn’t work.</p>
