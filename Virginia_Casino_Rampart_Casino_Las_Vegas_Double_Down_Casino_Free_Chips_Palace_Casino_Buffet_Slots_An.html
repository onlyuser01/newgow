<p>Play’n GO is excited to spearhead the convergence between iGaming and traditional casino gaming</p>
<p>Play’n GO, a developer of exciting casino experiences, announced that its best online slot, Book of Dead, will now be available at land-based casinos in the United Kingdom. The launch of the game’s retail edition comes thanks to a partnership agreement between the developer and William Hill.</p>
<p>As a result of the deal, players can now find Book of Dead at fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) across William Hill’s brick-and-mortar casinos. The game is currently available at around 100 of the operator’s stores and will be launched in all of its venues in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>For reference, William Hill operates more than 5,800 FOBTs across its 1,450+ shops in the UK.</p>
<p>The retail launch was made possible by Play’n GO’s new framework, which will allow it to translate its digital slots to the retail space. This means that each title from the company’s extensive library of over 300 games can be potentially launched at a land-based casino.</p>
<p>UK players can expect to one day see new hits such as Boat Bonanza and Legion Gold hit the retail space.</p>
<p>William Hill and Play’n GO Are Excited to Innovate Safely</p>
<p>William Hill’s UK gaming director, Ian Millman, commented on the launch of Book of Dead at his company’s properties. He noted that William Hill is constantly looking to innovate and provide the best gaming experiences to its players.</p>
<p>Millman is certain that UK players will enjoy playing Book of Dead at the operator’s shops just as much as they’ve enjoyed playing it in the company’s online space for many years. He concluded that Play’n GO is one of the best possible partners for William Hill because of its passion for gaming.</p>
<p>We can think of no better partner than Play’n GO, who share our passion for responsible gaming and entertainment, to drive innovation through the gaming industry together. Ian Millman, UK gaming director, William Hill</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s co-founder &amp; chief executive officer, Johan Törnqvist, also commented on the launch, calling it a “significant day in the history of the company.” According to him, this attests to the hard work and expertise of the supplier’s team.</p>
<p>Törnqvist added that Play’n GO is excited to spearhead the convergence between iGaming and traditional casino gaming.</p>
<p>The convergence between the online and land-based gaming parts of our industry has been long overdue, and I’m excited to see the world’s most popular online slot game, Book of Dead, make its long-awaited UK land-based debut. Johan Törnqvist, co-founder &amp; CEO, Play’n GO</p>
<p>Törnqvist added that this is only the start, teasing that his company intends to further explore the translation of online slots into land-based setting. He concluded that his company will do so in a safe manner because it genuinely cares for safer gambling and the future of the industry.</p>
<p>William Hill believes just as strongly in this [in safer gambling] as we do, and I’m sure this land-based partnership will be a long and fruitful one. Johan Törnqvist, co-founder &amp; CEO, Play’n GO</p>
<p>This is notably the first time Play’n GO’s online slots have been available in a traditional casino. Some of the supplier’s latest games include Sweet Alchemy 2 and Rascal Riches.</p>
