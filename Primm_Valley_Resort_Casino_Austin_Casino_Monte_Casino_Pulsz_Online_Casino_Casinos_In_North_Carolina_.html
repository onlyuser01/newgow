    <h1>Primm Valley Resort Casino Austin Casino Monte Casino Pulsz Online Casino Casinos In North Carolina</h1>

<p>Daily fantasy and sports book provider DraftKings announced Tuesday it launched the standalone version of its online casino app in Pennsylvania. Before the launch, DraftKings’ online casino was present in the state, being embedded in the DraftKings Sportsbook app which launched in the spring.</p>
<p>DraftKings standalone casino app presence in Pennsylvania makes the Keystone State the second to feature the gaming app of the company, after it made its successful debut in New Jersey last month.</p>
<p>Exclusive DraftKings Games, Third Party Offerings</p>
<p>The new standalone version will allow fans of online gaming in Pennsylvania, much like the ones in New Jersey, to enjoy a dynamic gaming experience and holistic product suite in the app developed by DraftKings, as it features new casino games unavailable anywhere else, on top of some revamped classic ones such as blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>Besides the popular slot and table games exclusive for the DraftKings’ casino, the standalone app will offer iGaming fans from both states games from third party providers, among which International Gaming Technology (IGT), Slingo and Scientific Games. Pennsylvania gamers will also have access to the Live Dealer Studio of DraftKings which operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, powered by Evolution Gaming.</p>
<p>The company that recently completed its merger with technology provider SBTech to bring technology in-house and cut on the largest chunk of its operating cost announced it is prepared to introduce its gaming app, a product of extensive research, in other states where regulations would allow.</p>
<p>Obviously, DraftKings started reaping the early benefits of having technology in-house and being able to leverage it into developing exclusive products. The daily fantasy and sports book operator is looking to diversify its offering, aggressively entering the iGaming space, a move prompted by the effects on sports during the virus-related health crisis when all major leagues in the US suspended action.</p>
<p>DraftKings is also expanding into new markets, and even managed to find a work around a legal barrier to entry in Illinois, the so-called bad actor clause. The sports book provider entered Illinois signing a partnership deal with one of the seven casinos in the state that were granted master licenses by the Illinois Gaming Board, Casino Queen in East St. Louis, instead of having to wait for 18 months and apply for one of the online sports betting provider licenses.</p>
