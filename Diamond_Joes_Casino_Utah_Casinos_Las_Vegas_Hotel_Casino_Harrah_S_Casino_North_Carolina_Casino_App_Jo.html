    <h1>Diamond Joes Casino Utah Casinos Las Vegas Hotel Casino Harrah S Casino North Carolina Casino App Jo</h1>

<p>Hello, I need assistance withdrawing funds amounting to 120 euros as I've been unable to do so myself for over two weeks now. My country has been restricted for access after making a deposit.</p>
<p>I came across this project on a forum and decided to try it out. I registered on October 19th. At the time of registration, a package of free spins for the Sweet Bonanza slot was granted to new members.</p>
<p>After registering and confirming my email, I activated the free spins and completed the wager, which I had to calculate myself due to their technical difficulties that didn't show the wagering completion. I asked support how to withdraw my funds, and was told to upload my passport and make a minimal deposit, at that moment, 5 euros via crypto method. I uploaded the documents and waited for three days before contacting them again, due to not receiving a response. They replied that there were no uploaded documents. In my 10 years of playing casino games, I've never experienced this.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, I uploaded the documents again. From my end, it showed that the documents were uploaded so I messaged support again. They responded that they couldn't see anything, so I sent them a screenshot. Eventually, they acknowledged receipt of my documents.</p>
<p>Next, they asked to verify my address, which took more than an hour because the website kept logging me out. After a while, my verification was successful. I attempted to withdraw, but it was rejected. I asked support why I couldn't withdraw my funds as my documents has been checked and deposit made. They responded that according to their bonus policy, the minimum deposit should be 30 euros and apologized for the incorrect information given initially. Despite already making a 5 euro deposit, I was required to deposit an additional 30 euros.</p>
<p>In the end, I made a deposit of 30 euros on November 1st, but the funds never made it to my account. What followed were lengthy correspondences with support and eventually on November 7th, they informed me that their payment system had a glitch and they had credited my deposit. I logged in to my profile and saw the funds reflecting a balance of 80 euros. I tried to withdraw, but there were no payment systems available. After another long discussion with support, I was informed they were having technical issues, asked to wait for a fix and told I needed to wager 1X my deposit. In the process of wagering, I managed to increase my balance to 120 euros.</p>
<p>Considering the casino was new, I thought it was normal to have a few technical hitches. On November 8th, I thought I'd check if the issues had been resolved so I could withdraw my funds. To my dismay, access from my country was restricted and trying to use VPN would completely block access to the site. I have attached screenshots of my email correspondences with support. I was unable to send the latest one as I didn't anticipate my access to the site being blocked. I need help withdrawing my funds. I've sent them an email, but there's been no response so far.</p>
