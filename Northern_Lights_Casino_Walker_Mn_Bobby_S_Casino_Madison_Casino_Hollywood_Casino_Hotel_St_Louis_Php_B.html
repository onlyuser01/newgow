<p>Sports betting kiosks and player account management to make entry in New York after Kambi PLC and Seneca Gaming Corporation agree on a sportsbook deal.</p>
<p>Kambi PLC and Seneca Gaming Corporation Partner in a Sportsbook Deal</p>
<p>Seneca Gaming Corporation and Kambi Group PLC have entered a partnership that’ll see the former get player account management and sports betting kiosks in its three New York casinos. The deal will also bring on-board Bragg Gaming Group, which will supply casino services via Oryx Gaming, its subsidiary.</p>
<p>This will see Bragg make a move into the expanding U.S. gaming market and its CEO, Dominic Mansour, said that the game-changing partnership with Kambi and Seneca will provide Bragg an opportunity to take advantage of the growing market.</p>
<p>He also said that entering the market through Kambi and Seneca is ideal and that their expertise in the industry will provide an edge for the customers.</p>
<p>In the agreement, Seneca Resorts and Casinos’ three properties, i.e. Seneca Allegany Resort &amp; Casino in Salamanca, Seneca Niagara Resort &amp; Casino in Niagara Falls, and Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino in Buffalo will get on-property sportsbook solutions from Kambi.</p>
<p>However, Seneca Resorts &amp; Casinos will be the pilot property to try out the retail sportsbook. Seneca Resorts &amp; Casinos recently struck a deal with Buffalo Bills as their exclusive casino partner. Nevertheless, Kambi should be done with integrations in the remaining casinos at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>Kristian Nylén, Kambi chief executive, praised Seneca Gaming Corporation saying that the company has developed “a reputation for delivering high-quality, entertaining experiences” and enhancing customer experience. Adding to this, Kristian said that the reputation will enhance further as customers get to enjoy the new sports betting offers from Kambi Sportsbook.</p>
<p>A Few Regulator Wrinkles to Iron Out</p>
<p>In the agreement, Bragg and Kambi will also provide SGC with mobile sports betting and casino. However, the move to go live online will depend on whether lawmakers regulate it in New York. State senator Joseph Addabbo, Jr. intends on introducing another mobile sports betting bill in 2020.</p>
<p>This is after the bill he introduced in the New York legislature failed to get a vote in the House despite passing the Senate stage. Currently, only on-property gaming and betting is allowed.</p>
<p>Further in the deal, Bragg and Kambi agreed to a commercial agreement that will see both entities venture into strategic opportunities mainly in the US with possibilities to explore other regions worldwide.</p>
<p>According to Seneca Gaming Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer, Holly Gagnon, “We are so excited to bring sports betting to our guests. Seneca Resorts &amp; Casinos remains steadfast in providing the latest and greatest offerings to our customers in entertainment, resort experience, and of course gaming. This collaboration brings a whole new level of excitement.”</p>
<p>Kambi is making good its strategy to partner with the biggest best gaming operators in each state. The other notable partnership was in March when Kambi and Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment (MGE) entered into a similar deal.</p>
