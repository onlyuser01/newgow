    <h1>Tropicana Casino Las Vegas Casino In Tulsa Ok Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Address Agua</h1>

<p>Colombia continues with the coordinated effort to tackle fraud in sports and protect integrity following on the last month’s one from the National Committee for the Prevention of Manipulation of Sports Competitions which set up plans for the remainder of 2020 and through 2021.</p>
<p>Raise Awareness in Sport</p>
<p>The committee’s call for better measures aimed at protecting integrity in sports is now followed by the launch of the #YoLeApuesto, an awareness campaign supported by online betting companies, the two industry representative bodies, Asojuegos and Fecoljuegos, and the national regulator Coljuegos, SBCAmericas reports.</p>
<p>“The gaming industry and in particular the online vertical are an ally of sport and, as such, we are working in a coordinated manner with sports institutions in actions that allow training, raising awareness, generating information exchange and, in In general, strengthen good practices to ensure and guarantee sporting integrity.” Evert Montero Cárdenas, President, Fecoljuegos</p>
<p>The new initiative is in line with the commitments both industry bodies undertook last year with Dimayor signing the Cooperation Agreement for the Prevention of Manipulation of Sports Competitions and the statement of integrity with the Ministry of Sports.</p>
<p>“We seek to make visible the commitment we have with sporting integrity and with the preservation of an industry that contributes millionaire resources to the health of all Colombians. The way to remember and emphasize our dedication to working for transparency is through this type of campaign.” Juan Carlos Restrepo, President, Asojuegos</p>
<p>Online gambling in Colombia generates more than COP 68 billion ($19.35 million) annually directed to the public wellbeing, setting the industry among the country’s important ones, and protecting the integrity of sports protects the industry.</p>
<p>The #YoLeApuesto Campaign</p>
<p>A series of messages through social networks and digital channels of the organizations and operators supporting the #YoLeApuesto campaign which began December 21, is looking to reach to everyone involved in sport, calling for honesty and seeking to raise awareness towards unusual behavior that influences outcomes in sports competitions.</p>
<p>“We are convinced that only together we will be able to shield the different sports in the country from any threat. The bookmakers are committed because they would be the most affected by any unwanted situation and that is why we have successfully joined this great awareness strategy.” Evert Montero Cárdenas, President, Fecoljuegos</p>
<h1>YoLeApuesto, which translates into “I Bet”, is urging sports bettors in the country to bet only through the platforms authorized by the regulator, currently 16, to facilitate monitoring of betting behavior and allow for early detection of betting irregularities, improve risk controls and prevent attempts to manipulate sporting outcomes.</h1>
