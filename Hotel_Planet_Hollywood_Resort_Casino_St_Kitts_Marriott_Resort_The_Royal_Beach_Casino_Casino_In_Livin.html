    <h1>Hotel Planet Hollywood Resort Casino St Kitts Marriott Resort The Royal Beach Casino Casino In Livin</h1>

<p>Back in December 2022, the Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), the Netherlands Gambling Authority, accused N1 Interactive Limited (N1) of offering online games of chance to residents of the Netherlands without a license</p>
<p>Malta-based online gambling company, N1, has expressed its disagreement with the decision of the KSA to fine them for violating the Dutch Betting and Gaming Act.</p>
<p>N1 Objects to KSA’s Fine Calculation and Requests Delay in Publication</p>
<p>In a statement, N1 denied violating the Dutch Betting and Gaming Act and argued that the KSA’s calculation for the fine was incorrect and baseless, leading to a disproportionately high amount. N1 claimed that the fine contradicts the legal basis for levying and calculating a fine under Dutch law.</p>
<p>N1 has objected to the KSA’s decision and requested that the publication of the fine be delayed until the proceedings are concluded. However, the KSA denied the request and went ahead to publish the decision.</p>
<p>N1 strongly believes that the KSA’s actions have put pressure on their current standing in both administrative and judicial proceedings. Nonetheless, N1 is confident that the court will consider their arguments in a fair and transparent manner to reach a decision that is based on the legal standing of the matter.</p>
<p>N1 intends to appeal the fine and present evidence to dispute its legitimacy and proportionality, especially in comparison to other sanctions imposed by the KSA on other operators in the past.</p>
<p>Furthermore, N1 stated that they have fulfilled all their regulatory obligations related to Anti-Money Laundering, GDPR, responsible gaming, and tax. The company remains committed to complying with all regulatory obligations, both under its license from the Maltese Gambling Authority and internationally.</p>
<p>Four More Companies Besides N1 Fined $27.7M by Dutch Gambling Regulator</p>
<p>Last week, KSA revealed that it had imposed €26 million ($27.7 million) worth of fines against five companies, including N1, that had offered games of chance to Dutch players without a license.</p>
<p>The fines, which had been announced in December, were challenged by the operators in court, but the judge rejected their efforts, resulting in the public announcement of the penalties. The KSA explained that the fines were implemented based on its newly adopted policy, which enforces penalties based on the turnover of operators in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The five operators that faced penalties were N1 Interactive Limited, Videoslots Limited, Betpoint Group Limited, Probe Investments Limited, and Fairload Limited. The largest fine, worth €12.6 million ($13.4 million), was imposed on N1 Interactive Limited, while Videoslots Limited was fined €9.9 million ($10.5 million). Betpoint Group Limited faced a fine of €1.8 million ($1.9 million), Probe Investments Limited was fined €1.13 million ($1.2 million), and Fairload Limited was fined €900,000 ($957,000).</p>
<p>KSA’s chairman, René Jansen, defended the fines, stating that they were proportionate and aimed at the operators’ wallets. The KSA explained that N1 Interactive Limited faced a larger fine due to repeated violations, while Videoslots Limited was fined for incorrectly displaying the KSA’s wordmark on its website.</p>
