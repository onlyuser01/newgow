<p>A new global network created by Gordon Moody, Better Change and Mindway AI is looking to provide the gambling industry with a new level of protection and become a one-stop shop for stakeholders.</p>
<p>‘Right Treatment, in the Right Place, at the Right Time’</p>
<p>The network created by Gordon Moody, the charity seeking to help those most affected by gambling harm, in partnership with Gibraltar-based nonprofit focused on reducing gambling harm Better Change and technology expert utilizing neuroscience and artificial intelligence to tackle problem gambling Mindway AI, will provide support for both players and operators, delivering innovative solutions to the industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on the unique partnership, Matthew Hickey, chief executive officer of Gordon Moody, outlined that the rise in demand for the charity’s services during the year in which applications increased by 123% is a display of the charity’s commitment to “tackling gambling addiction” and providing access to the “right treatment, in the right place, at the right time.”</p>
<p>Hickey continued by noting how “crucial for Gordon Moody” is to work in partnerships if it is to continue to grow its services and “meet the demand of those needing treatment and support,” emphasizing the dynamic collaboration with Mindway AI and Better Change as “the way forward to increase the focus on responsible gambling.”</p>
<p>Innovative Online Learning Platform with Customization</p>
<p>A key part of this new partnership and global network will be an innovative online learning platform that will allow full customization to enable ease of use with operators and their staff.</p>
<p>The platform will provide bespoke modules and engaging lessons available in different languages to extend the platform’s reach and impact, as well as empower the network to continuously evolve and develop through collaboration to meet the demands of the fast-paced and tech-driven industry.</p>
<p>On behalf of Better Change, its founder Victoria Reed expressed her pride to work with like-minded partners and her strong belief that collaboration is the key to impacting individuals and making gambling as safe as possible for players and operators alike.</p>
<p>“The decades of experience Gordon Moody has in treating gambling harm, coupled with the expert technology and innovation from Mindway AI, is perfectly complemented with Better Change’s consultancy and industry experience, allowing us to truly deliver tangible change in the industry and we can’t wait to grow and develop a global network,” Reed concluded.</p>
<p>Rasmus Kjaergaard, chief executive officer of Mindway AI, agreed that “industry collaboration between different types of organizations” is critical to the mission of empowering gambling operators and enhancing the level of player protection and “the exact reason why” Mindway AI decided to join this new global network and bring its “sophisticated RG solutions and services.”</p>
<p>“At Mindway AI, we urge all industry parties to collaborate on enhancing player protection rather than to compete in this important field,” he concluded.</p>
