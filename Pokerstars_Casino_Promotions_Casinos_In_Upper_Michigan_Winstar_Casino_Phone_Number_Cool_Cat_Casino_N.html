<p>BtoBet will bring its Neuron 3 Platform to power Wazibet’s offer as part of the former’s expansion in the African sports betting market.</p>
<p>BtoBet Expands Into Kenya</p>
<p>IGaming and Sportsbook provider BtoBet has signed an agreement with Kenyan sports betting operator Wazibet. The agreement is another step in BtoBet’s continued expansion into the growing African betting market and was signed in collaboration with the company’s certified African partner SMT Gaming.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, BtoBet will power Wazibet’s online presence through its innovative Neuron 3 platform. Furthermore, the sportsbook provider will assist Wazibet with both management and technology support.</p>
<p>The Neuron 3 platform will open up a world of possibilities for the growing Kenyan operator. This includes, but is not limited to, local and international betting, live sports events, jackpots and a wide range of virtual sports.</p>
<p>Wazibet Marketing Director Nathan Omurambi said that the company was thrilled to have access to BtoBet’s innovative platform. He added that the Wazibet will use Neuron 3 to provide a tailored betting experience for players.</p>
<p>Booming African Market</p>
<p>The partnership is part of BtoBet’s expansion into the African market. Just last month, the company sealed a similar deal with Nigeria-based Oat Betting Network. The deal is virtually identical to the one with Wazibet, in that BtoBet will power Oat Betting Network with its Neuron 3 platform. The agreement was brokered by SMT Gaming.</p>
<p>According to BtoBet Chief Marketing Officer Sabrina Soldà, the African market is quickly shifting towards digital channels. While this is true of many markets across the globe, Ms. Soldà says that the African market is transitioning at an especially fast pace.</p>
<p>The African online gambling market has long been underestimated, but international operators are finally paying attention. The old logic was that Africa simply does not have the technology needed to sustain a powerful gambling industry. However, the continent’s mobile internet connectivity has expanded very rapidly over the last few years.</p>
<p>According to a recent statistical analysis, around 11.5% of all internet users are based in Africa (Q1, 2020). This number will only grow in the future as internet access becomes faster and more ubiquitous across the continent.</p>
<p>In 2018, the African sports betting industry was estimated to be around $37 billion.</p>
