<p>The leading provider of content for the online gambling industry, Pragmatic Play, announced a new content distribution deal, expanding further its presence in Europe. The company revealed Wednesday it agreed to provide its leading portfolio of slots for Azerion's Whow Games, a leading German social games operator.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, Pragmatic Play's award-winning slots games will become available via Azerion's Myjackpot.com, jackpot.de and Lounge777.com. This will deliver exciting new titles for customers of the German operator. At the same time, Pragmatic Play will benefit from expanding the reach of its portfolio and tapping into new audiences.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest collaboration, hit games such as Aztec Blaze, John Hunter and the Book of Tut Respin will become available for the German-facing operator. What's more, the collaboration will deliver highly popular games such as Sweet Bonanza and Gates of Olympus, among other award-winning slots for customers of the operator.</p>
<p>In a statement released on December 7, 2022, Philip Reisberger, CEO at Whow by Azerion, said: "At Azerion, we're passionate gamers and experienced game developers so we recognize strong quality game products." He acknowledged that Pragmatic Play's comprehensive portfolio expands significantly the operator's offering.</p>
<p>At the same time, Reisberger said that adding content from the leading developer enables Azerion to deliver "entertaining content with international appeal in a risk-free and play-for-fun online casino destination to people who love games and playing them as much as we do."</p>
<p>The latest collaboration comes on the heels of another announcement from Pragmatic Play. Earlier this week, the company introduced Diamond Dazzle Bingo, its newest bingo product. The new game expanded Pragmatic Play's offering further.</p>
<p>Before that, again this week, Pragmatic Play announced the release of Virtual Sports Darts. This marked the company's latest title as a part of its Virtual Sports games portfolio. Besides engaging gameplay, Virtual Sports Darts stands out with customization options that make it suitable for different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Focusing on the new deal with Azerion, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, Irina Cornides, said: "Azerion represents the fresh, contemporary face of online gaming and entertainment and is the perfect placement for our diverse slotcontent."</p>
<p>Last but not least, she added: "We're delighted to welcome them as a partner and look forward to working together to strengthen both our brands."</p>
<p>As noted, the aforementioned deal expands the company's presence in Europe and further solidifies its position as a leading developer of casino games. In addition to Germany, the company teamed up recently with Livescore Bet for the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands last month.</p>
