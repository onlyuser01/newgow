    <h1>Myb Casino Boston Casinos Cool Cat Casino Bonus No Deposit Hard Rock Casino Online Greektown Casino</h1>

<p>Good evening. I don't know how to deal with it anymore at zodiac casino I won 1500 without bonus!</p>
<p>The win was acquired with the 16 digit pin code paysafecard kt. I bought a gas station.</p>
<p>But the problem occurred when I wanted to pay, I stated by bank transfer, I'm sure I wrote the data that they wanted as the name of the bank, account number, etc. Everything looked right. After half a month, it all came fine, but finally they sent me an email from probably I wrote the wrong details of the bank so they sent me s5 to the casino account money..so I asked a friend it's my distant relative actually but to explain it to them ... but to help me because I don't speak so much English I don't know the language at all he yes..no but he mistakenly added his payment card and had it paid out while not paying out he still paid 300 to plus with his card, so he had a total of 1800 s but there were no winnings with that card .. and yes we read the conditions that must not be win paid to a different card than I registered in the casino, but as this happened, I immediately wrote a live chat and I also have screenshots of how they wrote me out that they don't see the problem, that it shouldn't be a problem and completely different to me they wrote as I wrote to them .. and another problem is that the casino zodiac has not communicated with me for two months, I still write riskmanagement@casinorewards.com and they seem to have nothing but I have the right money since it was with 16 local pinkod and not cards and I only paid kt. I acquired (1500) with that code. And on behalf of God, they got me blocked..please you if you can help. Thanks</p>
