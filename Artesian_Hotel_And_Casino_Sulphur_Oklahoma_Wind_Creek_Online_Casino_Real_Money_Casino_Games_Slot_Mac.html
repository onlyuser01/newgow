<p>Ada has partnered up with Playtech for a new collaboration through which the company will deploy its automated chat solutions. According to the partners, this step will create a deeply-personalized experience that is based on Ada AI algorithm and technology. It will also provide Playtech with the means to further promote responsible gambling and player protection.</p>
<p>Ada Deploys AI Automation Tech to Promote Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Ada CEO Mike Murchison was thrilled with the opportunity provided to his company and said:</p>
<p>We are excited to be launching this partnership with Playtech. Integrating Ada’s conversational AI and Playtech’s IMS allows Playtech Operators to deliver the VIP customer experiences that players expect, resulting in higher containment rates, an increase in bet rates, and better monitoring for player safety. Ada CEO Mike Murchison</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly welcomed by Playtech, which hailed the new collaboration. SaaS commercial partnerships at Playtech, Mark Jones, said that the company was committed to introducing tools and technology that partner businesses need to make sure that their players are having the best possible experience.</p>
<p>The latest tie-up with Ada is a step in this direction, as Playtech is confident that it will be able to deliver a world-class experience. Jones further spoke about the advantages for players and operators:</p>
<p>Providing all customers with a VIP experience is becoming significantly more important and allows our players to have the very best personalization technology at their fingertips at all times. SaaS commercial partnerships at Playtech, Mark Jones</p>
<p>The partners will not launch Ada’s product right await but wait until 2023. Once the solution is live, however, Playtech partner operators will have the opportunity to go live with automation and further enhance the efficiency of their day-to-day operations as well as long-term sustainability. Both companies agree that uplifting the customer journey through the promotion of responsible gambling remains a core tenet and objective for both.</p>
