<p>Prince Harry and wife Meghan have named their royal baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. The atypical designation has delivered UK oddsmakers a massive victory.</p>

<p>The baby boy was born on Monday at 5:26 am local time (BST) weighing 7lbs, 3oz. The prince made an appearance before reporters later that day to explain the child and mother were healthy, but did not reveal his name. Two days later, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and her prince shared the name via social media. A</p>
<p>After the child’s gender was revealed, Main Street bookmakers adjusted their odds on potential names. Archie wasn’t a frontrunner.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes had Arthur the favorite at 5/1, followed by Albert and Philip (6/1), James (8/1), and Alexander and Alfred rounding out the top five at 10/1. Ladbrokes says it took just £100 ($130) on Archie being the correct identity.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers had Archie around 100/1 of being chosen. At those odds, bettors won $1,000 for every $10 wagered.</p>
<p>No Household Name</p>
<p>The royal baby attracted a flurry of novelty bets throughout the UK. Books offered various odds on the child’s birth including gender.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers thought news had leaked out of the Royal Family that Meghan was having a girl. So much action had come in on the baby being a female that several books including William Hill removed the gender line.</p>
<p>The gender outcome also delivered the books a strong win, as three in four wagers were on girl.</p>
<p>Seventh in line to the throne, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor’s name, according to the Royal Family, means “genuine, bold, and brave son of Harry.” His parents are not giving him a royal title, opting instead for simply “Master,” as they attempt the dubious task of providing the child a normal upbringing.</p>
<p>“He has the sweetest temperament,” Meghan told reporters. “He is really calm. He has been a dream. I have the two best guys in the world, so I’m really happy.”</p>
<p>Odds remain on who will be named Archie’s godparents. Meghan’s close friends Jessica Mulroney and husband Ben Mulroney are the strong favorites at 1/14.</p>
<p>Close celebrity pal George Clooney (6/1 to be named godfather) said on Jimmy Kimmel Live this week that the royal couple shouldn’t call on him. “That would be a bad idea,” the actor stated. “I’m a father of twins. I can barely do that.”</p>
<p>Landmark Marriage, Birth</p>
<p>Archie is the first British-American prince born into the UK Royal Family. “I suppose it shows how international and diverse we are as a society,” royal reporter Roya Nikkah told CBS News.</p>
<p>Meghan Markle, as she was known prior to marrying Prince Harry last May, was a rather unlikely candidate the join the Royal Family. The mixed-race 37-year-old had previously been married, and was a Hollywood actress.</p>
<p>Tabloids battered her joining the Royal Family, with the Daily Star Online going so far as to say, “Prince Harry could marry into gangster royalty – his new love is from a crime-ridden Los Angeles neighborhood.” The gossip site added, “The royal’s future mother-in-law still lives in Crenshaw, surrounded by bloodbath robberies and drug-induced violence.”</p>
<p>The duchess countered her critics, “I don’t read any press. I haven’t even read press for ‘Suits’ (her former TV show). The people who are close to me anchor me in knowing who I am. The rest is noise.”</p>
