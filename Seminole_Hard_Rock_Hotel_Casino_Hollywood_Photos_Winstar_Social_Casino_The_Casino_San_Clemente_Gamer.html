    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Photos Winstar Social Casino The Casino San Clemente Gamer</h1>

<p>Dear Matej,</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.</p>
<p>We have had a thorough review of the user’s account, along with their full gaming activity and would like to shed some light on the matter.</p>
<p>We can see that the customer had in fact made two separate deposits of 200 EUR each, with the latter one being tied to the claimed 50% reload bonus. They first placed the entirety of their deposited funds on a sports bet and then proceeded to play on slots with their bonus balance until they exhausted it down to 0.50 EUR upon which they cancelled their bonus, which was their first violation of our corresponding bonus' Terms and Conditions, which state the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The deposit and bonus can be used on Casino and Live Casino but cannot be used on Sports Betting. If used, all winnings will be seized.</li>
</ol>
<p>After exhausting their bonus balance and having cancelled their bonus, the previously placed sports bet was shortly after voided and all 400 EUR returned to the player’s account.</p>
<p>They have subsequently proceeded to continue placing bets on sports events with their first one being for 357.14 EUR, which we could also consider has been placed partly with their deposit, which was not tied to the reload (200 EUR), and the remaining 157.14 EUR was from the deposit tied with the used reload bonus. Therefore should we consider that the customer was allowed to play on both different events, this would still mean that 44% of the subsequent winnings of 507.14 EUR would be tied to the funds connected to the reload bonus, meaning that the winnings on the balance would be split into 284 EUR (from their non-tied deposit) and 223 EUR (from the deposit tied to the reload).</p>
<p>Afterwards the customer placed a bet for 262.51 EUR, which was lost. Considering the fact that with non-sticky reload bonuses customers first play with their deposited amount and subsequently with bonus funds, we can consider that the entirely of the bet was placed with their first deposit, not tied to the reload, meaning that the remaining funds from the separate deposit would be 21.5 EUR.</p>
<p>The customer has since proceeded to place a number of sports bets with mostly funds from the deposit tied to the claimed reload bonus.</p>
<p>Upon a detailed investigation of all bets and the percentage of funds originating from the separate deposits, we can see that the user’s ultimate balance of 960 EUR has 174.83 EUR originating from the sole deposit and 785.17 EUR which would be from the deposit, tied to the reload bonus in question.</p>
<p>We would like to draw attention to the following two terms of our promotion’s Terms and Conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The deposit and bonus can be used on Casino and Live Casino but cannot be used on Sports Betting. If used, all winnings will be seized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any winnings made prior to the bonus expiring can be withdrawn by cancelling the bonus, but the maximum winnings that can be withdrawn will be 2x the initial deposit amount. If the winnings are made from the initial deposit, the maximum withdrawal amount will be two (2x) times the initial deposit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Should term 4 be enacted, the amount of 785.15 EUR should have been adjusted down to the original deposit amount of 200 EUR and the amount of 585.15 EUR should have been removed from the player’s account as the customer has used their deposit to play on sports and the bonus funds on slots.</p>
<p>Due to an error on our part in checking the player’s activity we have erroneously only negative adjusted 160 EUR from the player’s balance instead of 585.15 EUR, which actually led to us paying out more to the user than we originally should have.</p>
<p>Should we also even solely consider term 11 we would still need to adjust down to the 2x max winnings from the original 200 EUR deposit amount, which would still require a negative balance adjustment of 385.15 EUR (785.15 EUR – 400 EUR), leading to us ultimately paying out more to the user.</p>
<p>Since the excess amount which we have paid to the player was due to an error on our side, with this we would like to consider this matter to be resolved.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for bringing this to our attention.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Sultanbet</p>
