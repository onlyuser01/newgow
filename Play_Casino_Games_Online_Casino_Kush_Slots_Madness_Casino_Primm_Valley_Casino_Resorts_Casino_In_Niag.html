<p>The regulation of the gambling market in Pennsylvania has led to a significant uptake in the rate of gambling participation online</p>
<p>According to the Department of Drug &amp; Alcohol Programs, Penn State University and the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, one in 10 Pennsylvanian residents is gambling online. The numbers come as part of a second annual report released by the two institutions as they continue to monitor and map the industry.</p>
<p>Increasing Number of Online Gamblers in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>However, out of the people who gambled online, one in three said that they had experienced a problem with the activity in the 12 months leading up to the survey questionnaire. This means that 1.7% of the population have had some problem with gambling, and have sought help at the state helpline, 1-800-GAMBLER.</p>
<p>These calls have allowed the institutions to obtain a good idea of who is vulnerable and exposed to gambling, with the majority of people reporting issues with gambling being married in their mid to late 30s who earn more than $50,000 a year and are mostly based in southwestern Pennsylvania. Those callers are mostly employed, the report stated.</p>
<p>To produce the report, the institutions turned to 1,100 participants from across Pennsylvania. The data collected this way will be leveraged to further understand how problem gambling affects individuals and how regulators can do better to assist vulnerable consumer groups in the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Drug &amp; Alcohol Programs secretary Dr Latika Davis-Jones added that the department wanted to ensure that people who struggle with their gambling can get all the resources they need to overcome the issue, and said:</p>
<p>Knowing the current online gambling trends in the state will help DDAP make informed decisions and help to spread awareness that treatment and resources are available to help when this recreational hobby becomes a more serious problem. Drug &amp; Alcohol Programs secretary Dr Latika Davis-Jones</p>
<p>Data Will Help Address the Issue in Future</p>
<p>The survey was backed by Penn State assistant professor of criminal justice Dr Glenn Sterner who said that this data would be beneficial as the state seeks to better address the increase in online gambling in Pennsylvania and how services can better aid people who are currently struggling with gambling.</p>
<p>The survey also seeks to outline how excessive gambling has a negative bearing on people’s lives, arguing that hiding the habit could put a strain on family relationships, and push people into lying to their loved ones. Gambling, says Penn State in a joint statement with the Control Board, can have a serious impact on a person’s financial, physical, and mental health.</p>
