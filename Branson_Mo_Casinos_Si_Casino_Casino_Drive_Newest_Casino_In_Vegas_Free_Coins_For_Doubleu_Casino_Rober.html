    <h1>Branson Mo Casinos Si Casino Casino Drive Newest Casino In Vegas Free Coins For Doubleu Casino Rober</h1>

<p>SBC Summit Barcelona 2023 brought us together with many of the industry’s most dedicated stakeholders, amongst whom is Robert Mabbett, the Engagement Director at Better Change, a company which focuses on spearheading positive change in the gambling industry. Mabbett discusses how he got involved with the gambling industry, and what led him to consider the need for a tighter and more dedicated focus on safer gambling.</p>
<p>Mabbett’s motivation to improve safer gambling comes from professional as much as personal reasons. He got started with this particular aspect of the industry through a bit of a lucky break, thanks to a position at Gordon Moody. This experience proved invaluable to him as it enhanced his understanding of gambling addiction by working with some of the most severely affected gamblers in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>"What I am passionate about is what can we do that engages the consumer and that actually makes a difference and works," Mabbett said. Gambling literacy is another important concept that Mabbett believes is important and that players need to be aware of, as they explore gambling products, regardless of the specific vertical. Mabbett touches on other interesting concepts, such as gambling volatility, big data and how it comes into play, the regulatory landscape and so much more.</p>
