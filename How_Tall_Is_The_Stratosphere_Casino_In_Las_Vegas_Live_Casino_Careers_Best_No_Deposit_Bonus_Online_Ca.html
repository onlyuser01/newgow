<p>Scout Gaming and Masters Cup Series Bring More Social Interaction to Fans</p>
<p>B2B daily fantasy sports and sportsbook betting supplier Scout Gaming has made its debut in the US, inking a partnership with the Masters Cup Series.

<p>The solution is aimed at both online and retail operators and will be extended to both sports franchises, as well as sports venues. As a result, Master Cup Series will be able to gain access to the sports wagering industry and introduce “next-gen, sports betting-like” experiences that do not expect participants to provide real money to participate.</p>
<p>Scout Gaming is bringing a combination of technology platforms that make its offer a viable choice, including its B2B Daily Fantasy Sports and Player Account Management systems that dovetail nicely with the new social experience.</p>
<p>The Masters Cup tour is a brand-new sports league that will benefit from the extended engagement tools provided by Scout Gaming. The tournament is set up by sports pro Rodney “Rocket” Morris.</p>
<p>Boosting Engagement and Identifying a Gap in Sports</p>
<p>Fans will have more opportunities to engage with the series as the event will be televised nationally and now feature Scout’s social games that boost interaction. Scout Gaming is confident that fans will have a reason to be active contributors to sports events 24/7 rather than in fixed hours.</p>
<p>Scout Gaming CEO Andreas Ternström shared his excitement to be teaming up with the Masters Cup Series for the company’s first move in the US. He stated, “We are thrilled to be officially entering the US market for the first time and to also unveil another addition to the Scout product line that will be launching with the Masters Cup Series.”</p>
<p>Ternström reassured that Scout Gaming is working on similar partnerships that could be revealed in the months or quarters to come. For his part, Morris, CEO of the Masters Cup Series, welcomed Scout Gaming and touted what he described as an incredible product that will add significant value to the series.</p>
