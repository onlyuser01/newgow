    <h1>Slot Casinos Near Me Golden Nugget Hotel Casino Las Vegas Casinos In Rhode Island Ducky Luck Casino</h1>

<p>Requested a withdrawal from tonybet Canada on May 10th for $1200 and was requested to go through KYC which was fully verified on the same day and the withdrawal was released on the same day. made a subsequent withdrawal request for $1000 which was paid within 24 hours. On May 11th 5pm UTC hit a $50000 casino jackpot and requested a withdrawal of the daily limit of $4000 immediately and withdrawals of the daily limit for the next 4 days. After waiting for 48 hiurs for the first payment to be processed I started contacting customer service to wait I was constantly replied that the withdrawal is in the queue and to be patient. I was told I had already passed all KYC requirements. 50 emails and dozens of live chats later, the payment was finally processed 4 days after I made the request. The terms and conditions of the website state that all withdrawals are processed within 48 hours once the account is verified. Note that my account was verified before I made this withdrawal request.</p>
<p>During the waiting time and a lot of anxiety about pote tislly not being paid I continued playing and lost a significant amount of the funds I had won.</p>
<p>I have 2 complaints. First, tonybet did not comply with their terms and conditions to process the payment within 48 hours once the account is verified. Second, I beleive that they were deliberately holding on to the 50000 jackpot with the hope that I would gamble it away during those 4 days. Which is exactly what happened. I acknowledge it is my fault that I gambled the money but had I not been under such immense stress I perhaps would not have. It is unethical for tonybet to hold funds for this purpose. Customer service was not able to ever provide me a valid reason why the processing was taking longer than the required 48 hours. See attached for some backup documents.</p>
<p>I have copies of all the email communications if needed.</p>
