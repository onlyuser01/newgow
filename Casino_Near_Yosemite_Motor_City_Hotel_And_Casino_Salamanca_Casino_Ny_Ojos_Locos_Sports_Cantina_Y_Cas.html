<p>3 Oaks Gaming, a leading supplier and content developer for online casinos, has made an important groundbreaking move into the Italian market, having entered the regulated jurisdiction for the first time through a partnership with Tuko Productions, a platform provider. The news was shared via an email press release.</p>
<p>Thanks to this collaboration, 3 Oaks Gaming will be able to bring many of its fantastic games to the THS content aggregation platform, owned by Tuko Productions. Part of the games to be launched through this partnership includes Dragon Wealth, Sticky Piggy, and Goddess of Egypt among others.</p>
<p>Thanks to the tie-up, 3 Oaks Gaming will be able to launch with a number of local operators and online brands that are powered by the THS platform as well. Among those are prominent names such as Sisal, Betpoint, Lottomatica, Goldbet and Snai, all of which focus on the regulated gambling market in the country.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming will be able to do this not just through its newly-fangled partnership with THS but also by the license it secured in 2022 to operate on the regulated iGaming market in Italy, an important milestone for the company. 3 Oaks Gaming Managing Director Sebastian Damian welcomed the news to work with Tuko Productions, calling it a "huge milestone" and a great way to make the company debut on the Italian market.</p>
<p>"We have continued our impressive upwards trajectory since the start of the year, and look forward to reaping the benefits in Italy thanks to the unrivalled reach of Tuko Productions and its THS platform," Damian concluded.</p>
<p>Tuko Productions Sales Director Vincenzo Tancredi was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see the partnership form. He hailed 3 Oaks Gaming’s strong portfolio of outstanding slot content that is now going to be available on the market and help strengthen Tuko Productions’ partners.</p>
<p>"With a strong portfolio and exciting roadmap, we’re very confident that we’ll enjoy an excellent and fruitful partnership together," Tancredi concluded. 3 Oaks Gaming previously teamed up with EveryMatrix with its games becoming a part of the CasinoEngine platform designed to give suppliers a boost.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming has also made several hires over the past months, strengthening its team in a bid to continue expanding. Krasimir Pankovski was hired as Head of Sales in November, and the company brought in Victoria Vashukevich as Head of Account Management in March.</p>
