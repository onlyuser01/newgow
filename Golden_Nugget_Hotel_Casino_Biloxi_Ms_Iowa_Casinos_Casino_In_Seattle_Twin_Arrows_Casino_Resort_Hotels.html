<p>BCverse will provide users with an opportunity to transfer their business into the Metaverse</p>
<p>BetConstruct, an award-winning developer and provider of online and land-based gaming solutions, unveiled a brand new Metaverse platform called BCverse. The new and innovative product has been designed to change how the online gambling industry works.</p>
<p>BCverse is developed in collaboration with PandaMR, which was responsible for building the comprehensive Metaverse platform. Through the new platform, BetConstruct hopes to revolutionize the iGaming sector, revealing a new “digital universe with limitless possibilities.”</p>
<p>As announced, BetConstruct, Fastex Ecosystem and other SoftConstruct brands will now have platforms on the Metaverse. Furthermore, BCverse is already live with all of BetConstruct’s solutions.</p>
<p>BCverse offers a brand-new digital environment with a cutting-edge combination of gaming, networking and commerce. Users can use this comprehensive solution to communicate and conduct business online.</p>
<p>BetConstruct added that BCverse is equipped with AI assistants that can quickly and accurately answer all queries. The assistants are available at all times and can serve people in more than 100 languages.</p>
<p>BCverse Seeks to Revolutionize the iGaming Sector</p>
<p>According to BetConstruct, BCverse will provide its users with an opportunity to transfer their business into the Metaverse, “where all their ideas turn into real business solutions.”</p>
<p>BCverse is an all-inclusive 3D recreation of its parent company and is a space where virtual reality meets real life. According to BetConstruct, the product will empower the company’s partners to transform and grow their businesses into a “gateway of endless technological opportunities.”</p>
<p>BetConstruct remains committed to digitalization. Its constantly expanding line of products and services is fully integrated into virtual spaces, providing immersive environments where ideas take a real form.</p>
<p>The launch of BCverse, according to BetConstruct, is a “major step” toward a revolution in how users see and deal with virtual reality.</p>
<p>A Busy Year for BetConstruct</p>
<p>2023 has so far been a busy year for BetConstruct. A month ago, the company secured a B2B license in Sweden, which allowed it to continue conducting its business in the country even after Sweden’s new rules came into force. In March, on the other hand, BetConstruct secured a license in Denmark, further expanding its reach in the Nordic region.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company also teamed up with BETER in a sports and esports-oriented deal. At the beginning of 2023, BetConstruct secured a racing content partnership agreement with SIS.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BetConstruct will present its latest updates at iGB Live Amsterdam, set to take place from July 11-14.</p>
