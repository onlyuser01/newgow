    <h1>Hollywood Casino Wv Native American Casinos Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Mississippi Seneca Resort Casino</h1>

<p>I have a withdrawal with this site. They owe me a lot of . MY account was already verified but for this withdrawal they ask me for proof of income which is already a weird request that nobody has every asked me.</p>
<p>I send them my business banks statement showing more than 25.000 Euros received for the past months. I assume this is enough to show I am not a bum although I do not know why they even have a right to ask for my income.</p>
<p>Then they ask more proof of earnings. I tell them I just sent them that. Now they ignore my last emails asking them to clarify why they do not accept what I sent and why they are asking more and what exactly they want.</p>
