<p>The French branch of the casino and betting company NetBet will now allow bettors to use Apple Pay to play on its platform.</p>
<p>NetBet Adds Apple Pay as a Payment Option</p>
<p>As the gambling industry grows increasingly aware of the importance of quality-of-life additions, more and more companies realize the benefits of adding more payment options. NetBet France has decided to improve the experience of its customers by allowing them to use Apple Pay to deposit money and withdraw their winnings.</p>
<p>The move caters to the needs of Apple users who like to play with NetBet France as it offers them a quick and safe method to manage their funds. Apple Pay is Apple’s proprietary payment solution and is considered by many to be one of the best payment methods out there. It offers multiple levels of security that make sure a customer’s money will never be lost. Apple Pay users can protect their accounts with Face ID and Touch ID biometric authentication options and be in full control of their funds.</p>
<p>NetBet France is excited to roll out the new payment option and provide its fans with a higher degree of flexibility. It emphasized that newcomers who use Apple will be able to register accounts and deposit money at lightning fasts speed, which will allow them to start betting in no time.</p>
<p>The Addition Will Likely Attract More Bettors</p>
<p>NetBet’s addition of more payment options is in line with the trend of online betting’s growth in popularity. While traditional bettors adore the experience of visiting a retail venue, online users tend to prefer the freedom playing from their phones offers. It has been estimated that an increasingly large number of French punters are inclined to pick the online alternative.</p>
<p>NetBet hopes that the addition of Apple Pay as a payment method will help it to appeal to younger bettors and help the operator rise above its competitors. Ana Stef, NetBet France’s Head of Payments, lauded Apple Pay as one of the best payment services on the market. Because of this, she is excited to add it to the list of viable payment options on NetBet’s platform and provide users with a higher degree of convenience. Stef said that she expects the addition of Apple Pay to suit the tastes of NetBet’s regular users and attract more customers to the operator’s platform.</p>
