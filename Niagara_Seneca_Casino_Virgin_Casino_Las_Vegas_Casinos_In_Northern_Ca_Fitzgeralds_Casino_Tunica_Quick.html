<p>Massachusetts-based Wynn Resorts’ Encore Boston Harbor is readying to restart operation 3,300 staffers shorter. The employees will be furloughed and reinstated on the job once demand picks up. Furloughed staffers are still considered employees of the company.</p>
<p>Encore Boston Readies for Restart 3,000 Staffers Shorter</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts’ Encore Boston Harbor has been one of the three properties most heavily affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Together with Springfield and Plainridge Park Casino, Encore has had to remain shut since March 15. However, Phase 3 of Massachusetts reopening plans has kicked in and Gov. Charlie Baker has given a formal go-ahead for casino properties to restart operations as early as July 6, backed by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>While this is refreshing news for the economy and casino workers, Encore Boston has announced that close to 3,000 workers will now have to be furloughed as the casino would not be able to provide enough work presently.</p>
<p>However, Wynn released a final statement in which the company confirmed that Encore Boston Harbor is planning a return. A ruling from the competent bodies will clarify whether Encore can serve food and beverage.</p>
<p>Wynn was employing around 4,420 staff members before the COVID-19 outbreak forced shut the better part of the economy, with some 3,300 people hired full time and close to 1,120 working part-time, based on Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) data.</p>
<p>Furloughs Don’t Mean Layoffs</p>
<p>While workers will struggle with not being able to work, furloughs mean that Encore is looking forward to “re-hiring” staffers. In fact, the nature of the furlough status isn’t technically a layoff.</p>
<p>Furloughed workers are on a temporarily leave, which means that they can be brought in overnight when need is, and are also still considered employees of the company. There has been a mix of such measures across the United States soon after the pandemic struck.</p>
<p>Back in May, however, Wynn cautioned that layoffs were inevitable. Before that, in April, Eldorado Resorts had to also furlough employees to cope with the unfolding crisis in the state. Other companies addressing the fallout of the novel coronavirus outbreak included Caesars, which furloughed 90% of staffers, and Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands that vowed to pay employees in full for 2 months.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts CEO Matt Maddox has also acknowledged that restarting operations is going to be difficult and it would depend on whether tourism and traveling begin to pick up. Massachusetts’ authorities have rolled out the strictest reopening measures state-wide and the Bay State now has a chance to slowly restart operations.</p>
