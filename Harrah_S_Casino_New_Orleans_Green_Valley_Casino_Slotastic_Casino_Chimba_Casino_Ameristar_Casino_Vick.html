    <h1>Harrah S Casino New Orleans Green Valley Casino Slotastic Casino Chimba Casino Ameristar Casino Vick</h1>

<p>Hello, I really like playing at this casino. Unfortunately, there was a problem with which I do not agree. I received cashback and played with it. Then I got free spins and won something with them. I made the specified wager and qualified for a max cash out of 50 euros. I continued to play with the 50 euros I won and finally won over 800 euros, after which I lost almost everything again. I was under 10 euros and then I was able to play up to 3000 euros again. But what I find really cheeky is that they don't award me this money because it would still be based on the 50€ cashout that I would get at most. I have already received it and have continued to play with my money. That would be the same if I had paid in again. The terms and conditions speak of a max cashout of 50€, but why did I receive 100 euros after my 3000€ payout. It's not in the terms and conditions. I honestly feel very betrayed by the casino. On my screenshot you can see it's there. The amount of money that can be withdrawn now. In this way, the casino guarantees me that it is my money that is due to me. If the casino thinks these are our terms and conditions, why are they giving me €100 as a consolation. You have not complied with your own terms and conditions. I'm talking about the principle here. I like playing there but the support is a disaster and questions cannot be answered properly. I am happy to change my rating for the casino if we come to an agreement</p>
