<p>The gambling regulator in the country uncovered breaches of the operator but also came across mitigating factors that enabled Betsafe to avoid sanctions or penalties</p>
<p>The Gambling Supervision Service under the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Lithuania, the gambling regulator in the country, unveiled details regarding a new probe into Lošimų strateginė grupė UAB, trading as Betsafe. On Monday, the regulator confirmed that it conducted an inspection of the company and uncovered breaches of the regulation related to online gambling.</p>
<p>Judging by a statement released by the Gambling Supervision Service, Betsafe breached the regulation between January 2 and January 4 this year. The breach was related to operating a remote gambling solution by Ezugi called Sic Bo.</p>
<p>According to the gambling watchdog, Betsafe did not have the required certificate for the aforementioned solution, which was in violation of Article 16, Part 5 and Part 5,1 of the Gambling Law of Lithuania. Additionally, the Lithuanian Gambling Supervision Service said that Betsafe breached the regulations for not having the authorization to offer the remote gambling solution.</p>
<p>The Company Collaborated with the Gambling Regulator</p>
<p>The gambling authority explained that it uncovered mitigating circumstances by the gambling operator. It said that Betsafe cooperated fully throughout the investigation and provided all necessary information, as well as explanations. At the same time, the Supervisory Service said that the iGaming operator hasn’t been sanctioned for such violations and when it was informed, it immediately discontinued the offering.</p>
<p>Further mitigating circumstances flagged by the gambling authority included the fact that Betsafe “did not receive income or other material benefits obtained directly as a result of the violations, none of the gamblers suffered damage due to the violations.” Additionally, the Supervisory Service in Lithuania said that it uncovered “no aggravating circumstances.”</p>
<p>In light of the aforementioned mitigating factors, the Lithuanian Gambling Supervisory Service deemed the violations by Betsafe as “insignificant.” Consequently, it said that it has decided not to impose any form of sanctions or penalties against the gambling operator.</p>
<p>The sanction which Betsafe avoided in Lithuania comes after the authority hit Baltic Bet with a fine. Late last month, the gambling regulator announced it imposed a fine surpassing $18,000 against the operator after it uncovered breaches related to the gambling advertising rules currently in effect in the country. The breaches, the authority said, dated between November 3, 2022, and February 28, 2023. At the time, the Supervisory Service said, Baltic Bet’s website featured a message that encouraged people to gamble. According to the authority, such messages are prohibited and in violation of gambling advertising regulations.</p>
