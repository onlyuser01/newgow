<p>TVBET, a global live TV games provider, has joined forces with Technamin, an emerging company that describes itself as “the ultimate iGaming provider.”</p>

<p>As per the agreement, TVBET will supply Technamin with some of its critically-acclaimed games. The latter will be implemented into Technamin’s offerings, allowing TVBET’s games to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>Technamin is a fairly new player in the iGaming sector. The Armenia-based company was founded in 2020 and has since been working hard to become a leader in iGaming solutions. Notably, Technamin’s offer includes software solutions, a customer relationship management solution, payment solutions and a player account management system, among other solutions and tools. In addition, the company offers a fully-customizable sportsbook and a dynamic casino filled to the brim with games from top iGaming providers. Sportsbook operators can also add live scores to their offerings.</p>
<p>The Companies Share a Common Goal</p>
<p>Peter Korpusenko, chief executive officer of TVBET, spoke about the new agreement. He shared that his team is glad to join forces with Technamin – a brand that offers TVBET “great prospects”, according to Korpusenko.</p>
<p>Korpusenko also noted that TVBET and Technamin have a lot in common in terms of goals. He pointed out that both companies’ main goal is to “provide high-quality products for the gaming field. Korpusenko concluded that the recent deal will help both companies grow bigger and deliver top-quality products to the end customers.</p>
<p>Suren Khachatryan, chief executive and founder of Technamin, also shared his thoughts. He praised TVBET for offering some of the most exciting products in live gaming, which is why Technamin is happy about the opportunity to join forces with the provider. Khachatryan said that his team is looking forward to offering TVBET’s acclaimed titles to players.</p>
<p>Khachatryan agrees that Technamin and TVBET have the same goal of bringing supreme experiences to the end players. Because of that, he believes that this partnership is a “significant step” in the right direction. The CEO concluded that he is looking forward to working with TVBET and feels excited about the future.</p>
<p>Last month, TVBET reinforced its footprint in Africa through a deal with Bitbille Gaming. The latter helped TVBET launch many of its games on Pigg Peak Casino’s online platform. Earlier that same month, TVBET expanded its offer by adding a new live game to its portfolio. The new title, Spin2Wheels, brought the total number of unique TVBET games to 16.</p>
