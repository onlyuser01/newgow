<p>About ELK Studios games</p>
<p>ELK Studios is a Sweden-based gaming developer that has been around since 2013. Its team has a quality-based approach to game creation, releasing relatively few titles but giving great attention-to-detail to the ones that they do.</p>
<p>In 2016, their Wild Toro slot made the news by winning an award at the EGR gaming awards, which was a reward for the team's hard work. Successive appearances at the ICE gaming event followed, which underlined their credentials as a prominent slots provider.</p>
<p>ELK also hold a range of important gaming licenses from jurisdictions such as the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and the Gambling Commission (GC). These confirm their commitment to high safety standards and fair gameplay.</p>
<p>You can find many of ELK's slots on this page where you can try them out free of charge. Maybe you've seen some of them before and were wondering which features they have: well, now you can give them a go without paying a deposit or sharing your details.</p>
<p>ELK Studios slots</p>
<p>ELK's focus on high-quality graphics and engaging style of play is evident throughout its collection of slots games.</p>
<p>The award-winning Wild Toro is evidence of that, with its beautifully animated reels and rewarding bonus features. The Toro Walking Wild bonus gives you four respins as an enraged bull moves from reel to reel, and if the matador appears, it moves into Toro Goes Wild, where the animal attacks his foe leaving several wilds for the next respin. Once the matador and his colleagues have all been defeated, the bull calms down and the game continues. Wild Toro is an enjoyable slot for those who like a bit of action.</p>
<p>Miss Wildfire is another ELK slot that has received rave reviews for its nice visuals and superb extras. The game revolves around a story of an alchemist whose experiments unleash potent prizes. As you might guess, Miss Wildfire is the wild that expands across the reels during free spins – you may get lucky and land the Super Miss Wildfire, which can spark a fire of wilds.</p>
<p>As well as these elaborate titles, ELK does also like to release the odd fruit machine game as an homage to the classic design of yesteryear, with Hit it Big and Hit it Hard being two examples of this. While the ELK blueprint is still there with a cool 3D design of a fruits machine, these are simple yet effective games that pay out on fruit combos and offer limited bonus features. The respin bonus is nice, though, and comes along quite frequently. ELK also offer several variations on the classic style, including titles such as Route 777 adding an interesting backdrop and soundtrack to jazz up the old-fashioned 7s and fruits symbols.</p>
<p>ELK's 'Mobile First' mantra means that all their slots are built to run just as well on mobile devices as on desktop computers, a necessary tool for today's players. This means many mobile-friendly casinos have ELK games as part of their selection.</p>
