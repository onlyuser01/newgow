    <h1>Casinos In The Poconos Casino Guide Best Casino In Miami Lake Of The Torches Casino Casino 777 Fanta</h1>

<p>Light &amp; Wonder has boosted its partnership with Fantasma Games by delivering its slot content to Loto-Québec, the provincial operator of lottery and iGaming products in Québec, Canada. Thanks to Light &amp; Wonder’s support, Fantasma Games has been able to establish its presence in the market and ensure that its expertise is needed.</p>
<p>Fantasma Games Enters Canadian iGaming Market</p>
<p>As an added plus, Light &amp; Wonder has had the opportunity to demonstrate the power of its dedicated OpenGaming platform, a content aggregation solution that enables studios to contribute their products to a pool of titles which is then distributed globally to operators.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming’s platform has been impressive enough to enable studios to rapidly increase their engagement and market reach. Fantasma Games’ titles are already part of the offer at Loto-Québec thanks to the OpenGaming leg-up.</p>
<p>The games available to players include but aren’t limited to Bounty Showdown, which is one of the latest and most coveted Fantasma options. Fantasma Games became a member of the OpenGaming family back in 2021 and has been able to since achieve important distribution pivots. Entering the product offering at Loto-Québec is yet another milestone.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder director of partnerships Steve Mayes welcomed this opportunity and said that Fantasma Games is one of the best OpenGaming operating partners. The company’s immersive games have allowed it to establish its footprint and broker high-profile partnerships with important iGaming brands. Mayes added:</p>
<p>We are proud to have supported the company’s entry into Canada and believe its games portfolio will resonate with a wide audience. Light &amp; Wonder director of partnerships Steve Mayes</p>
<p>Fredrik Johansson Excited about Future Opportunities</p>
<p>Fantasma Games founder Fredrik Johansson spoke about the newly-formed partnership, saying that he was thrilled to see the company’s products going live with Loto-Québec and further strengthening Fantasma’s reach. He stressed the importance of global expansion as such:</p>
<p>Expanding into new markets is hugely important for our overall strategy and OpenGaming’s global reach is exactly why partnered with Light &amp; Wonder in the first place. Fantasma Games founder Fredrik Johansson</p>
<p>Johansson noted that Fantasma Games will be looking to expand and strengthen its presence in Canadian markets, and thanked Light &amp; Wonder for the opportunity to be breaking ground in this important market.</p>
