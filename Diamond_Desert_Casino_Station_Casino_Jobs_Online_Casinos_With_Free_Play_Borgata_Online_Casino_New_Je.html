<p>The luxurious Talking Stick Resort and Casino in Scottsdale, Arizona, has become the official casino sponsor of the WM Phoenix Open professional golf tournament.</p>
<p>WM Phoenix Open’s Fan Zone to Be Renamed</p>
<p>The agreement will see the gambling and hospitality venue work with the elite sporting event for the next three years. In return, Talking Stick will have its branding promoted during the event. The casino resort will have an exclusive presence in the Phoenix Open fan zone. The latter will see its name changed to Talking Stick Fan Zone, in line with the deal.</p>
<p>The Talking Stick Fan Zone will allow golf fans to enjoy some premium content, including various activations by Talking Stick Resort and Casino. The company will use the opportunity to launch its new marketing campaign called “Turn it On.” Furthermore, visitors to the fan lounge will be able to enjoy a Putt and Spin Roulette game that allows them to win some exciting prizes.</p>
<p>Talking Stick is Thrilled to Work With Phoenix Open</p>
<p>Ramon Martinez, the director of public relations for Talking Stick Resort and Casino, spoke on the deal. He mentioned that the resort has long had involvement with WM Phoenix Open because of how close the event is to the venue. Additionally, Martinez acknowledges the excitement the golf tournament brings to the Valley, which is why the current deal seemed like the logical move for both parties.</p>
<p>Martinez added that the Talking Stick team is pleased to take its relationship with WM Phoenix Open a step further and is thrilled to work with the professional golf event, hoping that this will be the start of a long-lasting partnership.</p>
<p>WM Phoenix Open is a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour and is currently in its 87th year. This year’s iteration of the exciting event begins today and will continue through 13 February. It will see 132 of the best golf players take part and play for a share of the $8.2 million prize pool. The best player will get almost $1.5 million and 500 FedExCup points.</p>
<p>Golf content has been growing as an increasingly attractive sports discipline to bettors. Yesterday, the largest independently-owned daily fantasy sports platform in North America, PrizePicks, signed a content sponsorship deal with the famous sports podcast series Tour Junkies. The deal between the two opens tons of opportunities to fans of golf, including the chance to win a meet-up with the podcast’s hosts at the Augusta Tournament Week in April.</p>
