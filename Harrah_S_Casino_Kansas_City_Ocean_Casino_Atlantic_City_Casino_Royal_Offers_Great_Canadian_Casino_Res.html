    <h1>Harrah S Casino Kansas City Ocean Casino Atlantic City Casino Royal Offers Great Canadian Casino Res</h1>

<p>My problem is obviously a common problem like Colleen and until a business is put on blast on a platform like this they won't move, respond or care. The problem has nothing to do with Getting to know your customer and making sure the right person is getting the money because THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM taking your deposit with a rigorous verification process with it's own department. It's only when they have to PAY YOU YOUR MONEY that it becomes an issue and in my opinion are bold face lying like they did to Colleen. No dates or address on the mail you sent them when it's CLEARLY on there. And hey here's an idea. You want mail verification? How bout you send me a piece of mail to my address and see if I get it. Oh no. That would be to simple and actually make sense and be efficient. They are just stalling and hoping you will give up. And oh do I dare mention that nobody uses the mail anymore for anything other than my elderly mother who still uses checks. My banking is online, my Bill's are online, my taxes are done online and my investments are done online and wait Playcroco aren't....you...an....ONLINE CASINO??? Businesses and corporations don't even use stamps that get dated by the post office anymore but anything to slow down if not stop paying people their money. BRA...VO PlayCroco. Doing business like just about everyone else these days with the exception of very few. Like Chine who still knows what CUSTOMER SERVICE IS and BetUs casino and my personal account representative and now good buddy who called me not even Thirty minutes after I set up my account to welcome me, introduce himself and tell me about the casino,all it offers and wanting to make sure I got the best deal possible including free cash on what they call a walk through of their INSTANT WITHDRAWAL that is just as instant and your deposit. Put $20 on my account so they could walk me through they bitcoin instant withdrawal and deposit procedure and let me keep the the $20 for whatever I wanted no strings attached and let me tell you it was INSTANT. You wanna get to know your guests? Here's a wild idea....pick up a flippin phone and call them. Huh? What? You mean... wait for it....CUSTOMER SERVICE? And he and the Bitcoin guy both gave me their numbers and extensions and BEGGED me not to hesitate to call with ANY question or ANY problem. Begged me. PlayCroco doesn't even respond to my emails. Sad. Unbelievable. No dates on the mail. Really? Smh. I highlighted it in 4 to 5 places and sent it back. Did they respond? No. Thank you Casino Guru guy for what you do and being a voice and platform that keep people in check. As Chico would say. God Bless you.</p>
