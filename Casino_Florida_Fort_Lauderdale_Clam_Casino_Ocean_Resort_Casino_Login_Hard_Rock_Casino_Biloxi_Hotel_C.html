<p>Quick Hit Ultra Pays Eagles Peak review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around eagles and their breathtaking habitat.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves flying high above a mountain forest landscape. With majestic mountains in the background, they’ll face a reel of animals and emblems of nature, most notably, a bald eagle.</p>
<p>This game is refreshing and great for players in the mood for a natural world escape.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a mesmeric tune filled with flutes and gentle vocalisations. It has a spiritual vibe that will make players feel as though they are communing with nature.</p>
<p>As players take in the evergreen scenery, they’ll practically be able to feel the chilly air and smell the pines. The mountains behind the reels are beautifully animated to reflect the glow of the sun on their snowy peaks. Meanwhile, the clear blue sky creates a sense of hope and vastness.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will find waterfalls, feathers, leaping fish, and of course, the iconic bald eagle. Each symbol seems to be part of a rugged and inspiring web of life.</p>
<p>The music and graphics of this game come together to create a consistent mood of wonder and natural reverence.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Quick Hit Ultra Pays Eagles Peak has a base game of five reels and three rows. Additional positions may be unveiled on the reels during special features (see more details below).</p>
<p>This slot uses an Anyway Wins System, meaning that payouts are given for landing matching symbols in adjacent rows from left to right.</p>
<p>Gameplay is smooth and fast, ensuring that players stay engaged.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bald Eagle symbol and the Quick Hit symbol.</p>
<p>When the player lands at least 3 Bald Eagle symbols, this triggers the Free Spins feature as well as awards x1 the total bet.</p>
<p>At random, the curtain covering part of the reels can be shifted, adding up to three symbols per reel.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, extra rows are added under the curtain and each reel has a randomised level to which the curtain is set. This changes every spin.</p>
<p>Landing 3 or more Quick Hit symbols awards the player credit prizes or Jackpots.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.89%, decidedly above our average yardstick of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€10.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less optimal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility nature-themed slot.</p>
<p>Its ample RTP and gorgeous animation make up for this game’s more modest volatility.</p>
<p>Players with their eyes strategy may wish to move onto other games, but they’ll still enjoy a visit to the mystical natural world of this slot.</p>
