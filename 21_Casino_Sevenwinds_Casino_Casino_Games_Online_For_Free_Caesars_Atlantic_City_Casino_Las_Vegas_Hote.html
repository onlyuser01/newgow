    <h1>21 Casino Sevenwinds Casino Casino Games Online For Free Caesars Atlantic City Casino Las Vegas Hote</h1>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Thank you for your replies. I made some investigation and I have some notes for both parties.</p>
<p>Dear Horus Casino team,</p>
<p>There was a similar case seven months ago in a partner casino. The player received a weekend bonus that he wasn't eligible for because he didn't make enough "clean deposits" during the week. The complaint was closed as unresolved because the casino granted the bonus to the player even though he wasn't eligible for it and the most important condition wasn't present in the specific bonus terms. This means that the casino knew about the problem but still didn't bother to put the condition to the specific terms or display any sort of warning to the players and happily sends the offer to players by email but the most important condition is missing. The argument that this condition is present in the bonus terms is quite weak. The whole situation looks like a trap for casual players. If you want the players to know about this, why don't you display the condition in the specific bonus terms, especially when you know it caused problems in the past?</p>
<p>Dear Niklasplay24,</p>
<p>It was pointed out that you already submitted practically an identical complaint regarding a different casino in the past. It was the very same problem with a weekend bonus and you not making clean deposits during the week. My question is if you already had a problem with an identical bonus in the past, why weren't you more careful with the bonus conditions and didn't follow them? I can imagine that new players can easily make this mistake but it's hard to believe that it would happen twice without intention.</p>
<p>Based on the arguments above, we will have to discuss the issue internally and I will get back to you with a conclusion.</p>
