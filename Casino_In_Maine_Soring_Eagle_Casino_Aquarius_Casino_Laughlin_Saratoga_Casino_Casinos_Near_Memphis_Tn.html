    <h1>Casino In Maine Soring Eagle Casino Aquarius Casino Laughlin Saratoga Casino Casinos Near Memphis Tn</h1>

<p>: x</p>
<p>I signed up three days ago and took advantage of the unconditional 100% wager bonus on my first three deposits. I was lucky and over three days I won 1600 euros. I requested a withdrawal, provided the requested parts. To my surprise, I have just received an email (below) where I am informed that my withdrawal is refused. I was given a list of games as long as the arm to explain to me that I won by playing among other games "prohibited" in the framework of game partly using an active bonus. I played on other machines but we stop at the fact that I also won at one of these games. So my withdrawal is refused. This list as it exists should be provided upon acceptance of the bonus to warn players. Disgusted.</p>
