<p>NOVOMATIC Digital Gaming and Entertainment division, Greentube, has deployed its games in the Netherlands with bet365, through a content alliance that is designed to strengthen both companies’ presence in the country and allow them to scale their offer by appealing to local customers and their preferences.</p>
<p>Bet365 is a prominent and respected brand that has been commanding a fair share of the market through its iGaming product which will now be further enhanced through games such as Always Hot, Sizzling Hot and Book of Ra.</p>
<p>The partnership will also see products such as Random Runner 15, Simply Wilder, and Super Random Flashback all deployed as part of this offer, with more releases and content planned down the pipeline.</p>
<p>Greentube Commercial Director David Bolas has welcomed the opportunity to see the supplier expand its presence in what has been hailed as one of the most lucrative and significant regulated markets in Europe, and did not miss to highlight the company’s own expertise in providing partners with outstanding products:</p>
<p>"We have a deep understanding of the market and what players want from their games content and we look forward to further enhancing what is already a great alliance with bet365."</p>
<p>Bet365 also welcomed the news through a spokesperson, explaining that Greentube brings a portfolio of cutting-edge products that resonate with players in the Netherlands and can now be a part of the operator’s own library. The games by Greentube feature classic and premium offerings that are designed to elevate the experience and make it fun for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Greentube has had a string of successful expansions over the past several months. The company strengthen its presence in both Europe and North America, with partnerships in Spain and Germany earlier this year. The company also expanded its reach to Pennsylvania in the United States, and Ontario in Canada, becoming a true globe-trotter of a supplier.</p>
<p>Greentube has similarly remained determined to scale its offer through the delivery of excellent games that are designed to give local operators in each jurisdiction an edge. NetBet also sought content from Greentube and signed a content alliance in March.</p>
