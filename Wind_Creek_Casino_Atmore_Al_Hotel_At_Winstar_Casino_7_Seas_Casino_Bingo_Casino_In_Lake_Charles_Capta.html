<p>Caesars has revealed that it will re-start operation on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, by reopening the renowned Flamingo Resort and Caesars Palace first. On Thursday, the company detailed a plan to reopen in The Strip, and test the process for the rest of its United States’ properties.</p>
<p>A Las Vegas Restart for Caesars with The Flamingo</p>
<p>The Flamingo is returning and the property will offer lodging, dining and gaming opportunities, meaning table games and slots, as well as outdoor pools. The property is the first of eight that Caesars owns in Las Vegas, besides the Linq Promenade, to reopen.</p>
<p>Since an earlier order to suspend operation was issued in March due to the COVID-19 outbreak, operators in Las Vegas have been keen to return back to business. However, any such move would require strict compliance with health measures. Gov. Steve Sisolak has said on several occasions that the reopening would depend entirely on health authorities, and be overseen by the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB).</p>
<p>Meeting All Regulatory and Health Norms</p>
<p>Caesars CEO Tony Rodio confirmed in the statement that the company would comply with all necessary guidance from health authorities and observe social distancing, introduce temperature checks for staff and patrons, and generally comply with health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>The operator will also suspend parking fees in a bid to recapture consumers. Should the Flamingo’s relaunch go well, Rodio argued, Harrah’s and Linq resort should be the next properties to go live, providing there are enough customers.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that restarting the industry in Las Vegas would constitute an important milestone, allowing the company to assess how to properly continue beyond The Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Rodio commented on the financial implications of the move, sharing his satisfaction that employees would be able to return back to work, and consumers will restart visiting the brand’s properties. He further noted that Caesars was grateful to all health workers and frontline respondents who have been working hard to keep COVID-19 contained.</p>
<p>“We are hopeful that the country’s continued progress in addressing COVID-19 and business conditions will allow us to reopen more of our properties and bring back more of our colleagues as it is appropriate to do so,” Rodio added.</p>
<p>Caesars will introduce a set of health and safety measures, as noted earlier. The company’s properties will undergo frequent cleaning and sanitization. Employees will receive temperature checks prior to each shift and a health screening program will establish which employees might need to be tested for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Furthermore, employees will need to wear protective equipment, and specifically masks. Patrons will also be handed masks as they enter Caesars’ properties, which while not obligatory, Caesars recommends wearing at all times.</p>
<p>More Brands Reopening Properties in Post Lockdown Lull</p>
<p>Another company to seek reopening is MGM Resorts, which owns 10 properties on The Las Vegas Strip. The company will focus on relaunching New York-New York and Bellagio first, and Las Vegas Sands will reopen its Venetian’s hotel. However, the Palazzo will remain shut for the time being. Red Rock Resorts is planning on six reopenings, by far the most ambitious move to come back with a bang.</p>
