    <h1>888 Casino App Crocs Casino Resort Free Casino Free Spins Pittsburgh Casino Casino Soundtrack PokerK</h1>

<p>PokerKamers.nl, the biggest poker affiliate in the Netherlands, has vowed to obey all of the new regulations imposed by the Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), the country’s gambling regulator.</p>
<p>PokerKamers.nl Will Remain Compliant</p>
<p>Ever since re-regulating its market on October 1, 2021, the Netherlands has been strict with its rules. The new Dutch market kicked operators who refused to comply and introduced numerous rules to ensure a healthy and sustainable gambling ecosystem. PokerKamers respects KSA’s vision and has introduced a new policy that will see it comply with the regulations to the utmost.</p>
<p>This is a daring move as it means the affiliate will have to part ways with some of its most influential partners who are yet to be licensed in the country. This includes Entain and its renowned poker offerings, partypoker and bwin. Entain was barred from the Netherlands market because it refused to comply with the new rules and pull down its offerings from the market after it was temporarily closed on April 1, 2021. Entain will have another shot at the Dutch market and may get a license by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>The Site Will Offer Improved Customer Experiences</p>
<p>The decision to comply may cost PokerKamers some of its offerings but Joris Koningsberg, the affiliate website’s founder, said he is prepared to do this.</p>
<p>Being fully compliant meant saying farewell to online poker sites that did not receive a license to legally operate in the Netherlands; this includes renowned sites like partypoker and bwin, as the initial application Entain, their parent company, got rejected.</p>
<p>Koningsberg called this “an easy choice” as he never wanted to deal with illegal sites. He also added that PokerKamers’ favorite partners have already gotten a license, so the removal of other poker offerings shouldn’t hurt its business.</p>
<p>The decision to obey the rules imposed by the KSA was accompanied by an overhaul of PokerKamers’ website. The site was improved visually and made more customer-friendly with the addition of an audit of all existing pages. A new poker course will teach newer players about the intricacies of the game, while poker cheat sheets will help amateurs keep track of the best moves in the game. PokerKamers has also added a new M-Calculator and a tournament filter to help players find one suited to their liking and skill level.</p>
<p>Despite parting ways with some of its partners, PokerKamers will likely add some of them once again if they successfully manage to acquire a license from the KSA.</p>
