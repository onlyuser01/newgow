<p>The pioneering esports wagering company has increased its presence in the Latin American region through a new targeted and innovative partnership</p>
<p>Moving forward, Rivalry Corp will work with a number of leading creators who provide the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) community in the country with relevant and high-value content. CS:GO is a video game that is played competitively and features annual tournaments that offer participants the chance to win millions worth of dollars.</p>
<p>Connecting with Brazilian Counter-Strike Audiences</p>
<p>Rivalry will work with Tribo, a Brazilian Counter-Strike content group that features five creators who have been engaging with the Brazilian CS:GO community, a demographic that encompasses millions of people. The five content creators include Alessandro ”Apoka” Marucci, André “Liminha” Kenzo, Fillipe “BT” Moreno, Victor “VelhoVamp” Taube and Jean “mch” Michel D’Oliveira.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Rivalry lead for Brazil, Luis Gonçalves, said that the company is passionate about supporting and developing esports communities, and enhancing the entertainment experience for every fan. Gonçalves further added:</p>
<p>Partnering with this group of great influencers will continue to open up authentic opportunities to connect our brand to the Counter-Strike fandom in Brazil. Rivalry lead for Brazil, Luis Gonçalves</p>
<p>Fans will get access to a number of great things to see and do thanks to this new partnership. The partnership is planning on premium content and experiences, live streams, giveaways, and in-person activations that will happen in-person at some of the biggest Counter-Strike events.</p>
<p>The partner content creators will also be on-site at some of the biggest events to provide entertainment to their followers and elevate their and Rivalry’s brands. The first coverage of the event that will be done as part of the new partnership is the BLAST Paris Major which has already started on May 8-21.</p>
<p>Always in the Best Interest of Fans</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Apoka, the influencer’s game tag, hailed the opportunity to work with Rivalry. He argued that the company has a deep understanding of what esports communities and audiences enjoy and want to see. Rivalry operates in the interest of fans, Apoka said, and he has a point.</p>
<p>The partnership will similarly focus on responsible betting as Rivalry is one of the most successful esports wagering companies, which has also transitioned into other verticals, such as casino and sports betting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tribo has some 2.7 million followers across its social and live-streaming platforms. They are expected to continue growing moving forward with the added support of Rivalry and their own communities and fans. Rivalry has to date signed partnerships with more than 100 gaming influencers across dozens of markets, and the company is not letting up any time soon.</p>
<p>Rivalry recently received $7.3 million from investors as the company continues to scale up its presence in the world of regulated esports betting.</p>
