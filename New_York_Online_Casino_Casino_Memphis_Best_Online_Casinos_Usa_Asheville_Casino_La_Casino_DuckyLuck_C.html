    <h1>New York Online Casino Casino Memphis Best Online Casinos Usa Asheville Casino La Casino DuckyLuck C</h1>

<p>I initially won over $60,000 (a little over $67000 if I remember correctly) $28,800 which was eligible for withdrawal. I reversed a couple of withdrawls and a few were rejected. I spent those funds with no additional winnings to claim. Minus those funds I had $15,000 to withdrawal, in $2500 increments. I have only recieved 1 deposit of $2500 of which there was a fee for the withdrawal and a currency exchange fee deducted. Currently I have 5 withdrawals in a "batch in process" status. I eventually was able to contact someone because i was a VIP (Golden Goose) player and verified those transactions were still in process.</p>
<p>As an aside, I've had a very difficult time contacting andyone from Ducky Luck Casino. They do not respond to my emails when they do it is very few and far between, with little to no assistance. For some</p>
<p>reason they have adifficult</p>
<p>time receiving the attachments i send with my emails. The email</p>
<p>feature on their site does not support attachments and the online chat feature has been disabled since I can remember. No one has been able to explain why this is thecase and no one has offered any resolutions for this either.</p>
<p>Back to the 5 $2,500 withdrawal in a "batch in process status" I realized my checking account number was incorrect due to using the auto fill feature on the withdrawal form. After I recieved the first deposit successfully I submitted withdrawls for the rest of the funds. After a few were rejected I realized the checking account number I submitted was incorrect. I used the auto fill feature when submitting the additional withdrawal requests. I'm not sure why but the international routing number for my bank instead of my checking account number was offered by the auto fill feature, which regrettably I used. I've sent numerous emails to Ducky Luck Support with probably a 10% response rate. In the few email responses I did receive I was told there was nothing that could be done and to wait for the withdrawals to reject. However that has not occurred. I called the number available to VIP Golden Goose players which is on their site on 7/12. After explaining the situation again. The rep asked me "how did you get this number?" Because I am no longer a VIP because I have not played or deposited since attempting to cash out my winnings. If I didn't know the VIP number I wouldn't be able to contact them at all! After explaining the issue, I was told the casino always pays out winnings to players 100% of the time and that I had recieved all of my winnings and there were no pending withdrawals on my account. I disagreed, let them know I can see the 5 withdrawals in a batch in process status and when I look up the withdrawal status there's a notice at the top of the screen stating "You have pending withdrawals. If you wish to fund your account, please reverse a withdrawal below." I was told to submitt the screenshot of the "batch in process" withdrawals I was referring to as well as copies of my checking account statements to prove I did not recieve the deposits. Which is interesting since you'd recieved a casino to be into of their book keeping and would know immediately if monies send to bank accounts have been rejected or not. I asked to speak to amanager and was denied. I could not escalate my issue at any level. I sent the requested bocuments on 10/12 and have not received any type of response not even to state the emails were recieved of the extremely sensitive personal information I sent they was recieved or not. I did resend the emails from 10/12 tonight letting them know I am not letting this go and will be seeking outside assistance including an attorney if necessary.</p>
<p>Any assistance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
