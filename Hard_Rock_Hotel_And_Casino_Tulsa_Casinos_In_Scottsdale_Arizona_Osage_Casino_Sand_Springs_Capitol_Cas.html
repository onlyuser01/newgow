    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tulsa Casinos In Scottsdale Arizona Osage Casino Sand Springs Capitol Cas</h1>

<p>Dear winnah,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the bonus and read the Bonus T&amp;Cs and I found the point that is important in this case. Please, see here:</p>
<p>"11. All winnings from deposit bonuses will be credited to the wallet with the following logic: 25% to the real money wallet and 75% to the bonus money wallet. All winnings from non deposit bonuses will be 100% credited to the bonus wallet. Bonus money will be converted to the real money wallet once the playthrough requirement is satisfied. If the player is using a bonus that requires a wager, a real part and a bonus part and the real money part is depleted first, then he needs to make a new deposit to keep wagering to release the bonus part."</p>
<p>This means, that you need to have real money in your balance while meeting the wagering requirements for this bonus. Such a condition is not very common and it certainly is not very user-friendly, but casinos have free hands while setting their bonus conditions and wagering requirements. Unfortunately, there is not much more we could do about it at this point.</p>
<p>I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if there is anything else I could help you with, otherwise, I will be forced to reject this complaint. Thank you very much in advance for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
