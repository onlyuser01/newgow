<p>Global sportsbook operator Tipico announced a new long-term partnership agreement with Columbus Crew, the first club in Major League Soccer (MLS).</p>
<p>Leading Sportsbook Operator Tipico Joins Forces with the First MLS Team</p>
<p>By joining forces with the Columbus Crew, Tipico was selected as an official and exclusive Sports Betting Partner of the team. Moreover, as a founding level partner of the club, Tipico will be granted access to “rights to marquee Crew assets.”</p>
<p>The sportsbook is going to benefit from prominent brand integration throughout the Lower.com field. Lower.com field is expected to debut on February 26 for its first full season. This marks the 27th MLS campaign that starts with the Black &amp; Gold. The new collaboration is going to bring exciting opportunities for sports fans. Tipico is expected to launch giveaways as well as compelling promotions via collaborative programs with the club. Additionally, Tipico plans to roll out its mobile sports betting app in Ohio.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is important to mention that the launch, as well as the other activations, are subject to the relevant regulatory and licensing approvals. Although lawmakers in Ohio legalized sports betting in late 2021, the activity is yet to launch. Back in December, Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 29 into law but now it is up to the Ohio Casino Control Commission to draft the necessary rules for sports betting. All in all, Ohio is expected to launch the activity by January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The Partnership Marks an Exciting Moment for Tipico, Columbus Crew</p>
<p>David Jenkins, Haslam Sports’ chief operating officer, revealed that it is thrilling to join forces with such a respected brand. He acknowledged that joining forces with Tipico marks “an exciting development for Crew supporters and sports fans in Central Ohio and throughout the state.” Jenkins explained that the team is looking forward to expanding the fan engagement opportunities in Ohio thanks to this partnership.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly excited to team up with The Columbus Crew, a premium brand with championship DNA, to introduce our Tipico sports betting experience to players in the Buckeye state.” Adrian Vella, CEO at Tipico US</p>
<p>Tipico US CEO, Adrian Vella, added that it is exciting to join forces with the Columbus Crew to introduce sports betting to sports fans in Ohio. He remarked that the mid-west holds an important role for the company on its way to expanding to more US jurisdictions this year. In conclusion, Vella said that Tipico “could not have asked for a better partner to help us introduce the Tipico brand and our proprietary technology to sports bettors in Ohio and beyond.”</p>
