<p>Brooklyn Nets vs. Philadelphia 76ers is one of the most interesting matchups of the 2023 NBA Playoffs. Their first duel is on the program on Saturday afternoon in Philly.</p>
<p>The game that kicks off the NBA Playoffs is Brooklyn Nets vs. Philadelphia 76ers. The boys from Philly got there after finishing in the No. 3 spot in the Eastern Conference. The Nets finished sixth, which is one of the reasons why they’re expected to lose the series.</p>

<p>Brooklyn Nets Hoping for a Miracle in Philadelphia</p>
<p>The Nets played two times in Philadelphia this season, losing each time. That’s sort of surprising because they did okay on the road this season. In fact, their away record in the regular season was 22-19 (.537), which makes them the fifth-best away team in the East.</p>
<p>Ahead of their trip to Pennsylvania, they got several players struggling with fitness. On the bright side, all of their key men are fit and ready to give their utmost on Saturday. The big question is whether their utmost is good enough to beat the Sixers in Philly?</p>
<p>76ers Have Huge Ambitions for 2023 Playoffs</p>
<p>The Philadelphia 76ers haven’t had a roster this strong in a while. It’s no surprise that they finished third in the Eastern Conference in the regular season with a 54-28 record (.659).</p>
<p>They finished the season with just four wins fewer than the Milwaukee Bucks who finished top of the table. They’ve been brilliant at home this season, with a 29-12 (.707) record at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Their best season this season is Joel Embiid who’s currently the No. 1 candidate to win the 2023 NBA MVP award. He’s been brilliant scoring-wise, especially against tough opponents. For instance, we saw him score 28 against the Bucs earlier this month, as well as 52 against the Celtics.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Nets vs. Philadelphia 76ers Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a real barnburner, with plenty of points on both ends. The last time these two met, the Sixers won 134-105. It was their final game of the regular season, so not all of their key men were on the court. This means that we’re in for even more excitement on Saturday. Still, we do think the boys from Philadelphia will win again.</p>
<p>Pick: Philadelphia 76ers to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
