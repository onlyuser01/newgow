<p>Dear andandjonnyx,</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you don't understand it or if you intentionally ignore the fact that providing the necessary documents for you to be able to successfully finish the KYC and AML is solely your responsibility. But as I mentioned previously, I find no merit in prolonging further discussion on this matter.</p>
<p>Once again, you have remained to view the situation only from your perspective, and my as well as the casino team's explanations and suggestions have not been taken into consideration.</p>
<p>To your question:</p>
<p>Am I correct in stating that the casino guru is encouraging the practice of attracting customers with a false AML policy?</p>
<p>No, you are wrong. Another interesting fact is that so far we have received only one complaint from Japan on MiuCasino regarding this issue, and it was only your complaint, which makes me wonder where the issue possibly lies.</p>
<p>The casino team has clearly communicated this to you:</p>
<p>In line with our AML &amp; KYC Policies, which all customers agree to during the registration process, we may request specific types of documentation based on the customer's country of residence. For our customers in Japan, the acceptable forms of identification for completing the KYC process are a Japanese passport or a My Number Card (the Japanese ID Card equivalent). Unfortunately, as per our current AML &amp; KYC Policies, we are unable to accept alternative documents such as a driving license or insurance card from Japanese customers.</p>
<p>Anyway, as mentioned above, the casino is well within its rights to request the above-mentioned documentation, and the responsibility lies solely with you to provide these documents if you intend to claim your winnings. if you are unable or unwilling to provide the necessary documents, the casino team has extended the offer to refund your deposit.</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information, we decided to close this complaint as unjustified. To minimize future inconveniences in this regard, I recommend reaching out to the live chat and indicating your ability to furnish only some documents for KYC. If the casino team accepts this, it is acceptable from our perspective.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
<p>Casino Guru</p>
