    <h1>Puerto Rico Casino Resorts Hotels Near Treasure Island Casino Jai Alai Casino Florida Wind Creek Soc</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru and OMNAMAHSHIVAY,</p>
<p>We'd thoroughly checked the case and it was proven via various tools that the player had operated more than one account on the site, which is not allowed as per T&amp;C. The detected matches are via IP, device, cookie and betting activity.</p>
<p>The detected matches via IP and Cookie are:</p>
<p>IP: 103.184.103.37</p>
<p>Cookie: rw489b12adf85ef5aa2c6841e5c55c178e7f67c83b2c308fb113f73C9f91al38</p>
<p>The usage of multiple accounts is in direct violation of our Terms and Conditions (which the player has agreed to upon registration). You can refer to the Terms and Conditions below:</p>
<p>https://betrophy.com/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>3.8. Betrophy holds the discretion to perform random security checks in order to maintain the highest level of security and make sure all measures to protect customer funds are in place. The customer, therefore, accepts that Betrophy may require further or additional information to verify and maintain the highest level of security.</p>
<p>3.8.1 The playerâ€™s account must be registered on his/her own, personal and correct, name and personal details. The individual has to ensure that all data given at the registration stage is true, complete, and free from error. Registration is allowed only once per person, family, household address, email address, payment account number, site cookies, IP address, and shared computer, i.e. Public library or workplace and cannot share any of the aforementioned with a previously registered account. This therefore also means that the player has to register personally. Furthermore, a player can only have one account. Any other accounts which a player opens with the company, or which are beneficially owned by the player shall be considered as duplicate accounts. We shall close any duplicate account/s consequence to the identification of the main account. If we close a duplicate account, deposits will be refunded, and all bonuses, free bets, and winnings acquired using that duplicate account will be void and forfeited. If the amount in the duplicate account does not cover the amount to be refunded to us, we shall seek to recover the loss incurred directly from any other of your accounts.</p>
<p>3.8.2 A duplicate account is considered as such in any case where the account IP address, Personal details, payment account number, site cookies match with an already existing account with the company.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Betrophy Casino Team</p>
