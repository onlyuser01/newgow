<p>Online casino and sports betting operator Rush Street Interactive (RSI) announced today an expansion of its products and services in West Virginia via the launch of its BetRivers online sportsbook.</p>
<p>‘High-Quality Products and Responsive Customer Service’</p>
<p>The addition of the BetRivers online sportsbook strengthens further RSI’s presence in West Virginia building on its online BetRivers casino operated in partnership with Century Casinos’ Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack &amp; Resort since April last year.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, RSI’s chief executive officer Richard Schwartz outlined the company’s expectations that residents of Mountain State would receive the BetRivers sportsbook with excitement due to their familiarity with the BetRivers brand due to its “high-quality products and responsive customer service.”</p>
<p>“We are pleased that our integrated app will provide one convenient location for players in West Virginia to switch effortlessly between the casino and sportsbook using phones, tablets and computers to experience all that we have to offer, from spreads, money lines, parlays, single game parlays, and player props to slots, tables games, and live dealer experiences.” Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>Following the launch of the BetRivers sportsbook, sports fans across the state can utilize the apps on iOS and Android, as well as the company’s website, to quickly and securely place bets on their favorite team and players, while players at BetRivers online casino can utilize their customer wallet for betting purposes.</p>
<p>Despite its late launch in West Virginia, the BetRivers brand managed to capture a share in the low teens of the state’s online casino market, according to the West Virginia Lottery Commission and some internal company estimates.</p>
<p>RSI’s Other Recent Developments</p>
<p>In February, the Chicago-based gaming company announced an agreement with Penn National Gaming that secured market access for its BetRivers online casino offering in Ohio, Maryland and Missouri for up to 20 years.</p>
<p>“Our experience in other markets has validated that online sportsbook players also enjoy the full services of our online casinos, especially the table games. Along with offering a more enjoyable experience through our platform, at RSI we are constantly striving to provide a more trusted betting experience by emphasizing usability, responsibility, and transparency.” Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>Outside of the US, RSI received its iGaming operator license in Ontario, Canada, in March – just in time for the official market launch on April 4, and joined the likes of 888, PointsBet, and theScoreBet, among others.</p>
<p>Also in March, RSI officially stated its interest in online poker via the acquisition of Run It Once (RIO) poker brand owned by poker pro Phil Galfond for $5.8 million. The acquisition paved the way for a fourth major online poker operator to appear and challenge the likes of PokerStars, World Series of Poker (WSOP) and BetMGM Poker.</p>
