<p>Incentive Games’ CEO John Gordon: “Trust Is Everything in This Business and We Take It To Heart”</p>
<p>Incentive Games has had a successful year with many high-profile developments over the past 12 months. At the end of 2021, the company announced a ground-breaking partnership with bet365, a household name in the betting and iGaming industry. Today, we speak with John Gordon and seek to find out more about the alliance with bet365 and how it impacts Incentives’ strategy heading into 2022.</p>
<p>Q: Can you tell us more about your recent partnership with bet365? Are there any aspects of it you haven’t commented on in the press release?</p>
<p>We will be supplying both Free-to-Play and Pay-to-Play games to bet365, so it is a huge opportunity to have our best-in-class products with the best-in-class operator. These will be bespoke products for the brand.</p>
<p>Q: How is the partnership going to impact Incentive Games in 2022?</p>
<p>Most people in the industry do not realize that our free-to-play games are not plug-and-play. They aim to help our clients achieve key operator goals. As such they require continuous analyzing and fine-tuning. As partners to our clients, we have access to sensitive operational data and this forces us to work with a limited number of clients per region. Trust is everything in this business and we take that to heart. Even if it means that we will have to limit the clients we work with.</p>
<p>Q: Speaking of 2022, what is your strategy for next year?</p>
<p>Our strategy for 2022 is to focus on the partnerships we have signed in 2021 and help them achieve their operational goals for 2022. Customer acquisition and retention are so valuable for our clients, as are unique products; as such, the demand for our games is becoming more significant over time. As such, we feel the need to only supply our games to the clients that understand the importance of our games and are a good fit for Incentive Games.</p>
<p>Q: Do you foresee big changes in consumer behavior that would drive different retention and monetization strategies?</p>
<p>Good question. The data drives the design. So when you put a game live and get millions of people playing it, the data is fascinating. We are good at predicting how the user will behave, but there are always some great A-Ha moments with new products.</p>
<p>Q: Would you call 2021 successful? What is your proudest achievement this year?</p>
<p>From a client point of view, I would have to say, signing this deal with bet365 – and another deal we have signed in December.</p>
<p>But I am proud of the fantastic team we work with, the products we have built and the results our products have achieved for our clients. In the end, it is all about the success of our clients.</p>
