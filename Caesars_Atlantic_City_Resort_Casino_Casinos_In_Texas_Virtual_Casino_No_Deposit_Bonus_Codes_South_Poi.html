    <h1>Caesars Atlantic City Resort Casino Casinos In Texas Virtual Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes South Poi</h1>

<p>The two partners will now collaborate on a sponsorship opportunity with Racing Post’s “What a Shout” show for the remainder of the flat racing season</p>
<p>Betfred is an established sports betting company and Spotlight Sports Group is a tech, content, and media solutions provider with a particular focus on the sports betting landscape.</p>
<p>Horseracing Coverage at Its Finest</p>
<p>Together, the two companies are stepping in as sponsors for the 19 weekly episodes of the show, along with the “Live from Town Moor” and “Live with the Champions” shows which cover the Betfred St Leger and British Champions Day at Ascot Racecourse races respectively.</p>
<p>This will significantly boost the two companies’ profiles and consolidate their presence with racing audiences. “Live from Town Moor” and “Live with the Champions” will benefit from Spotlight Sports Group’s own advanced technology and will be filmed using the company’s studio.</p>
<p>The shows will be filmed live and on location. Meanwhile, “What a Shout” has been one of the leading Channel 4 racing events, presented by Emma Spencer, featuring a number of Racing Post experts and prominent industry experts. Racing Post’s YouTube channel already has 50,000 subscribers and is on track to exceed these numbers.</p>
<p>Betfred has been one of the most prominent backers of horse racing in the United Kingdom and the company has a clear commitment to make sure that it continues to do so. A spokesperson for the company said that the latest collaboration with Spotlight Sports Group and their video content offering would help elevate the shows offered by Racing Post a notch further.</p>
<p>Betfred said that the company was excited to be promoting its own brand and name through an engaging content format that will definitely stick with players and make a strong and lasting impression.</p>
<p>Great Opportunity to Boost Racing Post’s Reach</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Spotlight Sports Group’s chief commercial officer Sam Houlding was similarly excited at this opportunity and said that the “What a Shout” series is a huge opportunity for fans to find out more about the sport.</p>
<p>This partnership with Betfred, however, said Houlding confidently, would have tremendous success on the show’s impact on consumers and horse racing specialists.</p>
<p>Much of this is because all partners involved are bringing their best experts in terms of technical expertise and years of experience commenting, analyzing, and offering insights into the horse racing industry as a whole. In April the Derby at Epsom Downs named Betfred as its new sponsor for the next five years.</p>
