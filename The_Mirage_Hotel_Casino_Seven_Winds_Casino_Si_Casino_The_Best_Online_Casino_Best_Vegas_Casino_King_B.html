    <h1>The Mirage Hotel Casino Seven Winds Casino Si Casino The Best Online Casino Best Vegas Casino King B</h1>

<p>I have never felt so screwed by an online casino like this before in my life ! At all cost do not put any money on this site they will keep holding and asking for diffrent documents until you give up trying ! I had all my documents up and verified and had been trying to withdraw by winnings constantly for 3 days straight with every single withdrawal being declined asking for a peice of information that was impossible to receive. After reading reviews and seeing other players experience the same issues I had decided to just throw the remaining balance I had of 1200$ away as there was no chance of me ever getting them to send me the withdrawal although all my information had already been up and verified . After wasting the money and contacting the 7-10 person in the 3 day span on chat which is also horrible and very hard to even talk to a worker , when I told them to close my account for good they said why ? Your account is verified as of today although I had already tried withdrawing and it would not allow me as they said there was an issue . The worker then said my account had been verified and I shouldn’t of had any problems withdrawing . Overall they will play with you like a cat and mouse . Very disappointed that I was not treated better and that there was no help from kingbilly at all through any of this . SO PLEASE DO ME AND YOU BOTH A FAVOUR AND DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HORRIBLE SITE. BY FAR THE WORST TRY ANy other site . If you send these guys money they will make you go through hell to even think you will get your money back but most likely won’t . And they will make everything fall back on you like it wasint there systems and team that could have helped .</p>
<p>As someone who works really hard for there money and put 200$ in to enjoy myself and try to win a few bucks the least you could do allow me to withdraw and not keep making me think I am going to get money I never would have . I will not and am not going to stop writing reviews till I either get reimbursed for the funds they basically made me gamble to feel like I wasint getting scammed ! No sympathy and very very bad reputation on Canadians I hope that you guys can figure this out because you truly have wrecked my day/week and month</p>
