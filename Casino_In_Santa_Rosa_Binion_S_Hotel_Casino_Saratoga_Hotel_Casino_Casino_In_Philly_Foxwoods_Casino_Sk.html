<p>SkillOnNet, an operator of online casino brands, has signed a new partnership with BF Games, a prominent supplier of iGaming titles. The partnership will allow SkillOnNet to strengthen its game library and bring even more worthwhile products to its brands.</p>
<p>BF Games will add as many as 80 new titles to SkillOnNet’s growing library and thus strengthen the latter partner’s standing in the industry and the appeal it holds with its audiences through content variety alone.</p>
<p>In the meantime, BF Games has been making steady progress in iGaming. The supplier, part of BeeFee Group, has cultivated dozens of cutting-edge games that utilize HTML5 technology to ensure compatibility and smooth pace of operation with any devices and operating systems.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, SkillOnNet Jani Kontturi welcomed the change to collaborate with BF Games on what is yet another excellent partnership. For his part, Kontturi welcomed the opportunity to work with BF Games and see these new titles added. He hailed BF Games’ products as games that stand out:</p>
<p>The games are visually striking with amazing audio and high levels of playability, which make them a valuable addition to our platform. We’re excited to see what they’re going to come up with next!</p>
<p>BF Games has released a number of worthwhile titles of late, including prominent options such as ChickenMadness Ultra, Fiery Slots, and more. These games are now integrated with the 3,000 games that are already part of the SkillOnNet platform, which has reunited some of the biggest suppliers in the industry.</p>
<p>BF Games Head of Business Development Claudia Melcaru was similarly excited with the partnership and called it an important milestone for the supplier as it reaches out to new audiences and establishes its footprint in new markets.</p>
<p>Melcaru added that BF Games will be looking hard to enhance the partnership and provide casinos using the SkillOnNet platform with a top-of-the-range gaming experience. SkillOnNet has been actively looking to increase the number of suppliers it works with.</p>
<p>The company has teamed up with several prominent and established brands in the sector, including Peter &amp; Sons and Playson. Players will have access to these and many more products featured at SkillOnNet, and not least, BF Games’ own signature titles.</p>
