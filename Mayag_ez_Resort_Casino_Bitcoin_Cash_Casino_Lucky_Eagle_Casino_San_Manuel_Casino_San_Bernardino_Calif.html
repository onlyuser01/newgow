    <h1>Mayag ez Resort Casino Bitcoin Cash Casino Lucky Eagle Casino San Manuel Casino San Bernardino Calif</h1>

<p>I submitted the exact same proof of ID when requesting the first payout as i did the 2nd. i recieved the email informing me of my proof of ID being accepted, so i figured since i was now verified and could withdraw i would try again.</p>
<p>the first loss I accepted because I was impatient, but the 2nd one was only 2 days later, the day after i recieved the documentation was approved email. approved. then after winning again I went to withdraw I was asked for the exact same thing they had just approved. I submitted my native status card which is legal government issued ID and have had no problem with in any other casino. It is valid for 10 years after being issued. My drivers license expired and I had already previously uploaded this earlier this year to replace it with my status card.</p>
<p>I attempted to talk with live chat but the bot says it doesn't understand. I then tried emailing them to ask why it was still asking for the proof of ID within a minute I recieved an email telling me my ID had expired...all of this is including dates of the emails is in the photos I believe. if not i can take screenshots including the dates.</p>
<p>I also included of what the bot says when asking for an agent.</p>
<p>Anyway. I did not change payment provider, address or anything. after sending the document the first time I understood them requesting ID again for a larger withdrawal, but after the 2nd when I couldn't get a hold of chat I looked at reviews on trust pilot here https://ca.trustpilot.com/review/megacasino.com</p>
<p>all people saying they've had similar issues with verification. so out of frustration knowing I would never get a hold of a real person I just said screw it and played it cause I'm not getting it anyway.</p>
<p>I figured at the very least since I saw on here that they had a good reputation and may have been good at one point that having zero customer service and nothing but automated responses is not acceptable, and that you should hear about my experience and others lately there.</p>
<p>if I get my deposits back I will be happy with that I know that because I lost the balance there's no chance of the winnings. if I don't though and megacasino doesn't at least give some sort of human response I'm hoping casino guru will change their review of the casino.</p>
<p>that being said if you believe the casino acted fairly I will accept your response to my claim I just wanted to lay out what my experience was and see the results</p>
