    <h1>Westin Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Pendleton Casino Horseshoe Las Vegas Hotel Casino Casino Food Rio</h1>

<p>I requested a withdrawal of â‚¬800 on 09/12/2022 and the status of my withdrawal is still pending.</p>
<p>I have read and understood the information on the payout conditions in full.</p>
<p>I only played with real money. A deposit bonus / free bonus was not used.</p>
<p>I have never paid anything there and have been successfully verified since 09/09/2022. (see the screenshot)</p>
<p>According to Casino Nomini's terms and conditions, withdrawals are processed within 3 business days.</p>
<p>When the payment had not yet been received on Thursday, September 15th, 2022, I contacted the live chat.</p>
<p>In the chat I was informed that my withdrawal is in the queue and is being processed by the finance department.</p>
<p>I was also told that I would get an email from the finance department once the withdrawal was processed. (see the screenshot)</p>
<p>Written to the live chat again on Friday, the employee writes that the payment is in the final phase and that I should be patient. Today I still haven't received the payment, so I wrote to the live chat again.</p>
<p>Again, I am only comforted with statements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Everything looks fine with your withdrawal. You will receive an email once it's done."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"A withdrawal usually takes 3 working days, but currently it may take a little longer due to technical issues.@Also, there are a large number of requests, which causes delays."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Your request has been forwarded to the relevant department. You will receive an answer as soon as possible."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I was asked again in the live chat and again I was just brushed off with ready-made copy/paste messages.</p>
<p>You get the feeling that you're just being put off, as you've seen from many other complaints about Nomini.</p>
<p>For the most part, everything is documented and attached to the complaint as evidence.</p>
<p>Communication via live chat does not bring a satisfactory result.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me to get my payout quickly.</p>
