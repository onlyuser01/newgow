<p>US sports network ESPN moved to ensure the services of its sports betting analyst Joe Fortenbaugh via a new-multi-year contract extension.</p>
<p>Ensure Continuation in Sports Betting</p>
<p>Under the terms of the contract extension, Fortenbaugh, who has been regularly contributing to ESPN’s Daily Wager program and has scheduled appearances on ESPN Radio, television shows and digital platforms, will host a new digital sports betting show/podcast starting from January.</p>
<p>Commenting on the contract extension, ESPN vice president of Fantasy &amp; Sports Betting Content Scott Clark expressed the network’s ambition to continue investing in its sports betting content, outlining Fortenbaugh as a “big part of that moving forward.”</p>
<p>“We are happy he is remaining with ESPN as we continue to ramp up our efforts around sports betting,” added Clark.</p>
<p>Featuring through the ESPN studio at The LINQ Hotel in Las Vegas, Fortenbaugh, who joined the sports network as a sports betting analyst in 2020, will continue to provide invaluable insights to ESPN’s audiences.</p>
<p>Take Sports Betting to Another Level</p>
<p>“They say if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life,” used the common phrase Fortenbaugh to explain exactly how he feels about his three-plus years at ESPN, outlining that “to be surrounded by so many talented and success-driven colleagues and backed by an infinite amount of resources is like his “professional dream come true.”</p>
<p>“Getting the opportunity to help build ESPN’s sports betting division was one thing, Fortenbaugh added, excited to have the chance now and “help take it to another level.”</p>
<p>Before joining the ESPN team in Las Vegas full time, Fortenbaugh featured for six years as a host of a morning sports talk radio at 95.7 The Game in San Francisco, while his first experience covering the sports betting industry dates back to 2011 when he lived in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Fortenbaugh, who is a native of Allentown, Pennsylvania, went on to graduate from Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, California.</p>
<p>The move to secure Fortenbaugh to a new contract extension will help ESPN and its efforts to launch its branded sportsbook. A recent survey among bettors revealed that the idea of an ESPN-branded sportsbook would be well accepted among them.</p>
