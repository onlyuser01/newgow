    <h1>21 Casino Mybookie Casino Tropicana Online Casino Atlantic City Casinos Near Tulsa Ok Casino Castles</h1>

<p>Ohio launched its regulated market at the start of the year. The launch comes more than a year after the lawmakers in the state legalized the activity back in December 2021. In less than two weeks after the market launch, the regulator in charge of sports wagering, the Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC) issued fines against operators for breaching rules primarily related to advertising.</p>
<p>Fines Need to Be Deterrent, Not a Part of Business Costs</p>
<p>Now, a new report reveals that the OCCC is prepared to enforce the rules while a problem gambling treatment advocacy group called for fines that aren’t “just a cost of doing business.” The Commission’s director of communications, Jessica Franks, was recently interviewed by NBC4 and revealed that the regulator takes breaches of the rules very seriously.</p>
<p>Derek Longmeier, the Problem Gambling Network of Ohio’s director shared Franks’ opinion adding that OCCC needs to make sure that fines are at a proportionate level so that operators don’t see those penalties as a cost of doing business in Ohio. He pointed out that although the Commission issued warnings and reiterated that compliance is important, it is now looking forward to seeing action from the operators.</p>
<p>“We need to make sure that the fines are at a level that it’s not just a cost of doing business.“ Derek Longmeier, director of the Problem Gambling Network of Ohio</p>
<p>Regulator Disappointed with the Operators</p>
<p>Franks added that the rules for betting advertising are different from one state to another. Still, she pointed out that the regulator in Ohio reminded multiple times that advertising in the state for people under 21 is prohibited. Consequently, Franks said that the Commission has taken relevant actions against operators that breached the betting advertising rules in Ohio.</p>
<p>“We have been very disappointed that for all of the talk that the industry has about wanting to ensure that only those over the age of 21 can place a wager, and that they’re not targeting folks that they shouldn’t, their actions right now don’t seem to be really matching up with the words.“ Jessica Franks, director of communications at the Ohio Casino Control Commission</p>
<p>The OCCC’s director of communications added that the regulator is disappointed to see operators in the industry breach the rules and advertise to underage individuals. At the same time, Franks said that the operators have not followed their promises considering their actions.</p>
