    <h1>Treasure Bay Casino Buffet Island View Casino And Resort Spirit Mountain Casino Oregon Ilani Casino</h1>

<p>Online slots supplier Red Tiger announced the launch of its exclusive timed jackpot titles in Michigan, introducing progressive slots to one of the USA’s most competitive markets</p>
<p>The Evolution-owned company partnered with several operators to introduce its titles to the Great Lake State, expanding its North American presence. Red Tiger had successful launches in several other regions, pioneering its innovative selection of timed slot titles. The supplier is optimistic that its products will prove popular with fans and help bolster customer engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Timed Jackpots Offer a Novel Way to Enjoy Games</p>
<p>Red Tiger’s cutting-edge progressive jackpot mechanic has already proven its merits in the North American market after successful launches in Connecticut, Ontario, and Quebec. The Evolution-owned supplier boasts 48 titles that support the feature, allowing operators greater control over jackpots while remaining fair and engaging for players.</p>
<p>Games with the feature have two progressive jackpots configurable by the operator that users are guaranteed to hit within a specified time frame. A basic Mini Jackpot, usually set to $100, helps keep players engaged. The Daily Jackpot commonly sits at $1,000 and can be configured to go off between preset hours.</p>
<p>Our unique timed jackpot mechanic will create a sense of excitement amongst players, a thrill that can only come from this countdown effect. Jeff Millar, Evolution North America CCO</p>
<p>The system keeps savvy players engaged as they wait for the big payoff, and operators can set the games to hit the Daily Jackpot between the peak hours of 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm, maximizing the time spent enjoying the product. The timed jackpots have already received regulatory approval in several regions, meaning the feature will only gain popularity.</p>
<p>Red Tiger Aims to Make an Impact in Michigan</p>
<p>Red Tiger’s substantial experience in Europe has proven invaluable overseas as the supplier pioneered the progressive jackpot mechanic in the North American market. Evolution CCO Jeff Millar was excited to oversee the launch in Michigan, expressing confidence in Red Tiger’s offerings and their ability to attract new potential partners, fostering lasting relationships with North American operators.</p>
<p>We look forward to launching Red Tiger jackpots in all approved jurisdictions across North America. Jeff Millar, Evolution North America CCO</p>
<p>Expanding in Michigan should be a substantial boon for Red Tiger. The state has a booming iGaming and sports betting industry, enjoying an impressive 41% year-on-year growth. Online casino games generated $1.58 billion in gross receipts for 2022, meaning Red Tiger can now truly test its offerings in one of the USA’s most competitive markets.</p>
