"I look forward to joining Rasmus Kjaergaard, Paula Murphy and Niamh Gallagher to supplement their efforts in making sure that Mindway AI remains to be the global industry leader in Artificial Intelligence solutions for Safer Gambling," explained Aupy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gallagher brings more than a decade of experience in marketing, conference production and events management.
