<p>Playson has launched Wolf Land: Hold and Win, the freshest installment in its popular Hold and Win series</p>
<p>Playson, the leading developer and supplier of cutting-edge innovative games in more than 18 regulated jurisdictions, has announced the release of Wolf Land: Hold and Win.</p>
<p>The 5×4 slot is the latest addition to the studio’s popular Hold and Win series. The game packs three different Bonus Jackpot symbols that can be accessed in all game modes for a chance to win up to x3,000 which is the capped size of the Grand Jackpot.</p>
<p>At the end of June, Playson teamed up with LuckyConnect for a new game distribution deal inked with Pronet Gaming. The latter announced it would benefit from the new content deployed by Playson and the LuckyConnect aggregation application programming interface.</p>

<p>All 25 active lines are filled with “excitement and exhilaration” with the help of the interesting mechanics expected to keep players glued to their screens. The studio has brought back the special Boost Feature to all game modes.</p>
<p>This means that whether they are engaged in the base game, a Free Spins round, or Hold and Win mode, players can combine the Boost and Bonus symbols to unlock the mechanic and enjoy a more lucrative session by accumulating the value of all the Bonus symbols and adding them to their winnings.</p>
<p>The Hold and Win and Mystery features along with the available in-game Jackpots add even more excitement to the experience. The Bonus Game becomes even more potentially lucrative when the Mystery symbol randomly pops up in the form of one of the three in-game jackpots.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Extra Bonus Feature allows players to take an alternative route to the Bonus Game.</p>
<p>Each Bonus symbol that is seen landing during the main game or during the Free Spins game will give players the opportunity to trigger the respective feature and adds a sufficient number of symbols needed to engage the Hold and Win feature.</p>
<p>To scoop up the x3,000 Grand Jackpot during the Bonus Game, players must fill up all 20 positions with Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>The Free Spins round can be triggered when landing a minimum of three Scatter symbols, bringing players eight Free Spins. More Boost and Bonus symbols are added to the reels during the same round, further boosting the game’s win potential and players’ chances to get access to the Bonus Game.</p>
<p>Playson’s chief commercial officer, Tamas Kusztos, spoke about the new release, calling it “another excellent example” of their popular classic slots, putting special emphasis on the Boost and Extra Bonus features that have always enjoyed a warm welcome from players.</p>
<p>In May, Playson announced it would expand its reach with 888casino in four new markets: Italy, Sweden, Denmark, and Romania. Earlier in the same month, the company released the news of its new partnership with Vincitu for the Italian market.</p>
