<p>Coins of Egypt review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>It’s back to the world of Ancient Egypt for this one. Like a lot of NetEnt productions, the theme is a kind of futuristic visual style, with ancient monuments augmented by fine metallic machinery and almost robotic creatures vaguely reminiscent of the original Stargate movie.</p>
<p>It is a flashy, highly-visual world, and a nice twist on a well-worn slot machine theme.</p>
<p>Coins of Egypt offers high quality visuals</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The visual style of the slot, as well as incorporating a lot of fancy gold filigree in its designs, is one of scale. The reels are arranged as part of a huge wall drawn as if seen from below. The reels narrow towards the top and you are left feeling like an ant crawling beneath something vast and unknowable.</p>
<p>It also has a bird with a mirror.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a somewhat stereotypical near East track, with some dramatic percussion to give some oomph to the reel spins. It works marvellously to generate the feeling of being back in the time of huge animal-headed gods as you gaze up on the towering reels above you.</p>
<p>All of this is then animated with the high production value that NetEnt always bring to these things. All in all, it is an impressive bit of design work.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is relatively straightforward given the level of work put into making the slot stand out visually. It is a five reel slot with three rows and a gimmicky pharaoh-faced "Collect" symbol (described in full below).</p>
<p>There is a decent pace kept up, and the fast spin is very easy and intuitive to use (just double click the spin button) but the lack of features is a bit of a drag.</p>
<p>Simple win in Coins of Egypt slot</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Every spin, a number of coins between one and three will appear on the first three reels. These coins will be randomly sized between two and fifteen times the bet. Should the Collect symbol fall on reel five, then the player wins the amount on these coins for that spin.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol, which has the image of a beautifully gilded bug, substitutes for all symbols except for the Scatter and Collect symbol.</p>
<p>5 of a kind win in Coins of Egypt slot</p>
<p>Hit three Scatter symbols to trigger the free spin bonus. The first thing to happen is that any pharaoh coins are added to each of the three chests which are activated during free spins. A seal can fall on reel five during each free spin. When it does it is added to the corresponding chest along with any coins present on the reels during the spins.</p>
<p>When three seals are added to a chest you win that chest the game bonus ends. The other two chests are removed from the game and you return to the base game.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player for Coins of Egypt is a solid 96.97%. This is above average and enough to win the game some favourable points from us.</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable</p>
<p>However, those points are put in jeopardy by the low volatility of Coins of Egypt. We prefer slots with higher variance as these work best with the kind of strategies we recommend.</p>
<p>The site we tested allowed a range of bets between £/$/€0.20 per spin up a maximum of £/$/€200 per spin.</p>
<p>Low symbols paytable</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Like many NetEnt slots there is little to fault Coins of Egypt for in the technical department. The visual style and the world they have built are unique takes on familiar themes.</p>
<p>The return to player on this slot is pretty decent too, and if it weren’t for the frustratingly low volatility we would be happy to recommend this slot.</p>
<p>As it stands it is an excellent slot, but doesn’t fit our requirements under the hood.</p>
