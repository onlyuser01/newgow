    <h1>New Casino In Chandler Montbleu Resort Casino And Spa Fremont Casino Hotel Betvisa Casino Konocti Vi</h1>

<p>Following the much-anticipated legalization of the Canadian sports gambling sector, truenorth.bet has obtained a license to go live in the country through Pronet Gaming’s platform.</p>
<p>As a result, Pronet Gaming is going to power the operator’s offer through its turnkey service, having been shortlisted from a number of competitors. Truenorth.bet has received an operating license by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission (KGC), which regulates the Mohawk Territory of Kahnawake in Canada.</p>
<p>The license is granted as an acknowledgment of truenorth.bet’s legitimate industry practices at a time when much of the Canadian sports betting sector is represented by grey area operators.</p>
<p>Flexible and Reliable Betting Partner</p>
<p>Pronet Gaming is a perfect technological partner that will allow truenorth.bet to further uphold these same standards for responsible gaming, self-exclusion, anti-spam and data protection. The flexibility of the Pronet platform allows it to work to any regulator prerequisites and boost truenorth.bet’s offer.</p>
<p>Truenorth.bet is also launching a number of micro markets on niche sports verticals, such as lacrosse, Canadian boxing, sprint car racing, and other markets that are not currently covered by competitors and will provide sports fans with distinct opportunities to place a wager.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Pronet Gaming chief sales officer Colin McDonagh had this to say: “As a brand, truenorth.bet is well-known for the quality of its offering and regulatory integrity and I’m pleased to say that we were able to adapt to meet those challenges in a well-established market.”</p>
<p>Ready to Dominate the Canadian Sports Betting Market</p>
<p>McDonagh acknowledged Pronet Gaming’s success in establishing itself as the go-to choice for truenorth.bet after multiple industry competitors tried to secure a similar arrangement. The current partnership will strive towards longevity and success.</p>
<p>Truenorth.bet spokesperson had this to add: “We’re very pleased to have launched truenorth.bet with Pronet Gaming and are confident that the quality of the user experience on the platform will be second to none.”</p>
<p>Pronet Gaming’s product quality and flexibility will allow truenorth.bet to get in the “driving seat as the Canadian market matures.”</p>
