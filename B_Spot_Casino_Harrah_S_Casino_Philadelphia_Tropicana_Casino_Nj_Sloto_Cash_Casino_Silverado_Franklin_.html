    <h1>B Spot Casino Harrah S Casino Philadelphia Tropicana Casino Nj Sloto Cash Casino Silverado Franklin</h1>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>The following problem I have already created my account 2020 but haven't played for a long time. Now I wanted to play and registered again with my email. I played and didn't think anything of it. Then I deleted the app again. Yesterday I wanted to play, downloaded and played the app and also won. But somehow the data was gone and it seemed strange to me. Then I researched and I noticed that there were suddenly two accounts with one I washed last time and with the other yesterday. I reported it immediately that it was strange and simply stated that the other account was addicted to gambling and that he would be blocked. Which isn't true, however, but it will certainly be blocked in this way. But now the lady has blocked my current account. In itself not bad because I just want the money and don't want to play anymore. But the money cannot be paid out because the documents are not verified and I can no longer press pay out. I reported everything extra and my double account was deleted and not the current one but think that they want to put a spanner in the works for me that I see no more money. I've often read that the extra is done that way. Please help me</p>
