<p>Kindred Group has told investors that the company will begin a share buyback. The buyback was approved during an Extraordinary General Meeting held back in June.

<p>The mandate will be available from today, August 1, through the next Annual General Meeting which is expected in Q2 2023. The idea is to return excess cash to shareholders, an official statement explained.</p>
