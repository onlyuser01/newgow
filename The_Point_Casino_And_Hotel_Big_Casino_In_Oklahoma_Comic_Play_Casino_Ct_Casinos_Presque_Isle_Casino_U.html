<p>The transaction, expected to close in the second half of 2023, values UFC at an enterprise value of $12.1 billion and WWE at an enterprise value of $9.3 billion</p>
<p>Endeavor and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) have agreed to merge into a new, publicly listed company consisting of two iconic, complementary, global sports and entertainment brands: UFC and WWE.</p>
<p>Endeavor to Hold Majority Stake in New Company with WWE Merger</p>
<p>Endeavor will hold a 51% controlling interest in the new company, and existing WWE shareholders will hold a 49% interest. Together, UFC and WWE expect to deliver an estimated $50 million to $100 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies by leveraging Endeavor’s back office and robust infrastructure.</p>
<p>“The new company will be well-positioned to maximize the value of our combined media rights, enhance sponsorship monetization, develop new forms of content and pursue other strategic mergers and acquisitions to further bolster our strong stable of brands,” said Vince McMahon, executive chairman of WWE.</p>
<p>Endeavor further expects significant growth across revenue areas, including domestic and international media rights, ticket sales and yield optimization, event operations, sponsorship, licensing, and premium hospitality.</p>
<p>Endeavor and WWE Announce Executive Team for New Publicly Listed Company</p>
<p>A new company will be formed with Ariel Emanuel as CEO, who will continue to serve as CEO of Endeavor. Vince McMahon will be the executive chairman of the board, and Mark Shapiro will be the President and COO of both Endeavor and the new company. The new company will have Dana White as the President of UFC, and Nick Khan as the President of WWE. The Board of Directors will have 11 members, with six appointed by Endeavor and five by WWE, and their names will be announced later on.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. The listing of the new company, which is currently referred to as NewCo until a new name is chosen, will expand the collective investor base to allow for broad market participation across Endeavor and NewCo.</p>
<p>Endeavor and WWE CEOs Open up about the Biggest Deal in Sports Entertainment History</p>
<p>WWE co-founder and executive chairman, Vince McMahon, and Endeavor CEO, Ari Emanuel, spoke exclusively to CNBC’s Scott Wapner on Monday, revealing the details of Endeavor’s $21 billion deal to merge its UFC brand with WWE. The deal will eventually see the new company go public on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>McMahon confirmed that this was the biggest thing he and Emanuel had ever done, combining forces like this has never been done before. When asked why he was willing to sell a controlling stake in WWE, McMahon stated that it was the right time and the next evolution of the company. Emanuel stated that the deal was a win-win for the shareholders of both WWE and Endeavor, as they were not getting the pure value of their assets independently.</p>
