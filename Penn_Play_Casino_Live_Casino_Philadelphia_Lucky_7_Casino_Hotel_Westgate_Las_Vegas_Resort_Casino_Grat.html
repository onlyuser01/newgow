<p>Bragg Gaming Group and Kalamba Games are back with another partnership in the North American market. After teaming up earlier this year to launch in the United States together, Kalamba Games is now moving in on Ontario.</p>
<p>The provincial market, which was regulated on April 4, 2022, has seen Bragg Gaming provide third-party products to local companies for the past several months now under the company’s local license. The latest news was shared via a press release.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming uses its dedicated Remote Games Server to ensure that operators get access to the fastest load-time and the best games. Kalamba Games is matching this offer by bringing its own RGS and Stargazer analytics platforms, that allow operators to further benefit from adding the developer’s products and receive insights into how well-received they are.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games will make its portfolio of high-performing games immediately available to Canadian players through any operator that opts for the games via Bragg Gaming Group. Kalamba brings a sizable selection of titles which will be a nice fit with Bragg’s platform, adds Chief Commercial Officer at Kalamba Games Andrew Crosby.</p>
<p>According to Crosby, Bragg Gaming has long demonstrated its commitment to building strong local market partnerships. Adding Kalamba’s unique titles to Bragg’s distribution platform is definitely a boon to the developer of iGaming slots, Crosby assured, but it also helps Bragg consolidate its standing in the market.</p>
<p>"Bragg’s established position within the Ontario market will see us deliver our titles to a number of operators in this newly regulated region for the first time and we’re eager to see players’ reception to our games," he concluded confidently.</p>
<p>Third-party partner content has always been one of the core strategies for Bragg, which is keen on adding more worthwhile products and titles to its portfolio that can then be shared with operators and their audiences. Bragg has been equally zealous about expanding its reach in North America.</p>
<p>The second-quarter earnings call confirmed the company’s long-term ambitions, which will be to secure more growth in the region. In May, the company also confirmed that it had acquired a license to operate in Pennsylvania, the United States.</p>
