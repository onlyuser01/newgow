<p>Sportsbook Action 24/7 has turned to ProhiBet to ensure the integrity and flawless operation of sports betting contests on its platform</p>
<p>The pair have agreed to utilize the latter’s fully encrypted decentralized cross-monitoring and notification platform, ProhiBet shared in a press release.</p>
<p>A historic joint-venture between Odds on Compliance and US Integrity Inc., ProhiBet is a company that addresses the dynamics of the sports gambling market in the United States and helps businesses navigate the difficulties of launching in new states and meeting rigorous regulatory standards, especially when it comes to flagging suspicious betting activity.</p>
<p>Establishing Trust and Ensuring the Fairness of Contests</p>
<p>ProhiBet has built a product that ensures transparency and trustworthiness and that translates into a strong foothold in new and existing markets for partners. More importantly, the company is focusing on making sure that professional and collegiate teams, as well as sportsbooks, have the tools necessary to ensure that insiders are compliant with existing regulatory norms.</p>
<p>ProhiBet has signed several high-profile partnerships over the past weeks and months, notably with Tipico Sportsbook and the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which came under a lot of criticism over its lenient gambling policy and had to address a slew of issues regarding the integrity of fights.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when sports betting is rapidly expanding across the United States, and when instances of professional and collegiate players breaking anti-gambling rules have been common. Commenting on the opportunity to further strengthen the integrity of her company and operations, Action 24/7 President Tina Hodges shared:</p>
<p>In the fast-paced world of online sports gambling, there’s nothing more important than having trustworthy and innovative partners in compliance, like Prohibet. Action 24/7 President Tina Hodges</p>
<p>This sentiment was echoed by ProhiBet managing director Matt Heap, who was equally happy to see his company’s advanced technological stack and solutions deployed with Action 24/7 to ultimately boost the operator’s transparency and provide it with the tools necessary to remain compliant.</p>
<p>Integrity All the More Important at Time of Increased Scrutiny</p>
<p>Both professional sports and collegiate sports have faced increased scrutiny tied to suspicious betting activity. Several high-profile cases have already led to suspensions. Ottawa Senators’ Shane Pinto for one was suspended for 41 games in October, effectively missing out on half the season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iowa State’s Jake Remsburg was one of the prominent collegiate athletes to have been suspended over NCAA gambling violations. The NCAA has been actively trying to address the issue with gambling student-athletes and has been educating schools and players on the dangers of gambling.</p>
