<p>PokerStars is sending waves across the poker, metaverse, and iGaming worlds with the rollout of its dedicated Virtual Reality (VR) solution on Meta’s Quest Pro mixed reality headset. The solution is set to go live on October 25 and make it possible for owners of the Quest Pro to join PokerStars VR and experience poker on a completely new level.</p>
<p>The company, which is owned by Flutter Entertainment, has been working on VR poker for the past several years, experimenting with various solutions and having a prototype ready very early.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of this solution include the full-color passthrough enabled by Meta’s device that allows for a brand-new level of experience that focuses on mixed reality, face, and eye tracking, and leverages other technologies that contribute to the overall player satisfaction and immersion.</p>
<p>Quest Pro will be adjustable to consumer surroundings so that they can get the best out of it. The solution comes with a hallmark upgrade that will add to the social dimension of the PokerStars VR experience and also let players see morerealistic facial expressions, pick from customized avatars, and so much more.</p>
<p>"Our goal with PokerStars VR is to push the potential of new technologies as far as we can to create a fun and authentic social casino game that really is limitless," commented PokerStars Director of VRJames O’Reilly. O’Reilly added that the entire team was extremely proud to be joining Meta’s Quest Pro solution and be part of the transformative virtual reality experience that the device is able to bring around.</p>
<p>"Our developers have been having great fun exploring what this technology means for our players and we can’t wait to show them what we have in store," he concluded. PokerStars VR has made sure that its solution is not an exclusive but rather a free-to-play social game that can nurture people’s love of poker and introduce them to fantastic gaming environments that will encourage them to pursue more opportunities.</p>
<p>It's not just poker games that the PokerStars VR lets you experience, however, casinogames, slots, and blackjack are all intertwined with the experience. Poker fans will be able to experience cash games, Sit &amp; Go tournaments, Spin &amp; GO’s, multi-table events, and so much more.</p>
<p>The PokerStars VR also comes with a set of built-in responsible gambling tools which seek to further elevate the experience and protect players from potentially pernicious effects from gaming too much.</p>
