<p>Popular UK sportsbook Coral launched a new value proposition in its Bet Bundles, giving clients a predefined set of five betting opportunities for half the price. The Entain-owned operator hopes to capitalize on the ongoing Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup and the Jump Season racing fixtures.</p>
<p>Bet Bundles Are Well-Positioned to Draw in Players</p>
<p>Coral’s new Bet Bundle packages come in two variants. Players have the opportunity to purchase a bundle of five bet tokens worth £1 each or five bet tokens worth £2 each, respectively costing £2 or £5. Coral refers to these as the Classic and Premium bundles.</p>
<p>These offers have some strict limitations to prevent abuse. Firstly, clients may only purchase one bundle of a specific type. For example, a player interested in the Football Weekly Bundle can only get it once, regardless of whether they choose the £2 or the £5 option. The individual bets inside the bundles on offer are also limited to specific categories, though they offer a good variety. Overall, the new system seems designed to draw in players with value propositions and entice them to browse the other available offers.</p>
<p>The Season Features a Hectic Betting Calendar</p>
<p>Coral introduces this new feature at just the right moment, as the FIFA World Cup heats up and the Jump Season in horse racing progresses to some of its most exciting fixtures. Each bundle is tailored to reflect the most popular upcoming events and gives players a taste of the various betting opportunities.</p>
<p>The operator has invested substantially in marketing with commercials on the new bundles in traditional and online media. Coral head of PR David Stevens noted that the UK sportsbook was one of the first operators in the industry to adopt this approach. He added that the value-focused bundle offerings would give players more wagering opportunities for less money during an exciting and opportunity-rich period in the sports betting calendar.</p>
<p>With the World Cup taking place at the same time as… the Jumps season…, we wanted to offer football and racing fans an opportunity to get even more value from a bet. David Stevens, Coral Head of PR</p>
<p>While it is true that sports betting fans will be able to get in more bets for their money, the new bundles are undoubtedly also geared to bring the Entain-owned brand as much profit as possible during the hectic winter season. Coral’s parent company spent the past few months diligently preparing for the World Cup, even studying how patriotism affected players’ betting habits. Fans generally agree that the Bet Bundles are a good addition, which means the initiative can be seen as a win-win for Coral and its customers.</p>
