<p>New York Confiscates $20 Million in Lottery Winnings from Welfare Recipients</p>

<p>New York State has confiscated almost $20 million in lottery winnings over the past four years via a little-known clawback policy that targets winners on welfare.</p>

<p>Many states deduct an individual’s outstanding taxes or unpaid child support from a lottery payout but New York is the one state that reclaims welfare payments too.</p>
<p>Authorities can pounce on up to 50 percent of a windfall to recoup anything the claimant has received in welfare over the last decade.</p>
<p>And since lottery winners of $600 and upwards must visit a state lottery center and proffer their Social Security numbers to claim their winnings, there’s nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>According to Syracuse.com, authorities have yanked payouts from under the noses of “lucky winners” around 30,000 times.</p>
<p>Black Market</p>
<p>Syracuse.com found that a black market in winning tickets has sprung up as a result of the system, as winners sell lottery tickets to third parties, or so-called “discounting schemes,” in an attempt avoid paying back money to the state.</p>
<p>Last month, Neil Ferguson, 50, of Manhattan, and Eduardo Moran-Barrera, 63, of the Bronx, were charged with criminal tax fraud for operating such a scheme.</p>
<p>Authorities became suspicious when they realized Moran had won the lottery 686 times since 2012, for a grand total of $1.48 million.</p>
<p>“These arrests mark the first significant cases where, thanks to joint efforts of commission and New York state Tax &amp; Finance investigators, we found individuals acting as ‘discounters’ to cover for others avoiding paying what’s owed and filing taxes on the winnings,” a gaming commission spokesman told the New York Post.</p>
<p>Easy Come, Easy Go</p>
<p>“We know all about [the program],” a woman outside a lottery vendor told Syracuse.com, on condition the journalist by her a scratch-off ticket. “If we win, we give the lottery ticket to someone that works.” When asked her name, she demanded another scratch-off ticket in return for supplying the information.</p>
<p>The clawback program was introduced in 1995 as part of a welfare reform package enacted by Governor George Pataki that was designed to “emphasize work, personal responsibility and temporary assistance instead of permanent dependence.”</p>
<p>But many have suggested the system is a little… well, mean, especially when you consider the disproportionate amount that the economically disadvantaged contribute to lottery ticket sales.</p>
<p>A 2011 study found that the people in the lowest socioeconomic strata in the US had the highest levels of lottery participation.</p>
