    <h1>Draftkings Casino Login Tropicana Online Casino Pa Rivers Casino Pittsburgh Casino Drive Pittsburgh</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Upon receiving a recommendation for this casino website through your platform, I felt confident in giving it a try. However, after making a small withdrawal, my confidence in the process has significantly diminished. I've diligently provided all the requested documents, but it seems the casino is unreasonably uncooperative, a sentiment that is echoed in various online reviews.</p>
<p>Initially, they requested a bank statement to verify my account, a standard procedure for MGA licensed casinos. I promptly submitted a mobile screenshot, as per their instructions, which displayed the issuing bank, logo, account number, and my full name. Unfortunately, this document was rejected on the grounds that it was scanned and lacked a visible date. I assure you, the document included a clear date and time stamp.</p>
<p>In response, I sent two additional documents: a screenshot from my computer and a PDF from my bank. Regrettably, both of these submissions were also denied, with the new requirement that screenshots were no longer accepted. They requested a PDF statement directly from the bank, an option that is not available to me.</p>
<p>Despite my efforts, I'm unable to obtain a bank statement that meets their stringent criteria. I've even consulted with my bank, but they're unable to provide the specific format Ultra Casino now demands.</p>
<p>I'm growing increasingly convinced, in light of similar experiences shared by others, that the casino's actions are designed to either compel me to reinvest my winnings or force me to surrender them, a tactic often employed with dormant accounts.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
