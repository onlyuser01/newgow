<p>To celebrate the new deal, the duo announced a new initiative taking place at 26 Leake Street, an award-winning bar. The event from G2 and Jägermeister offered a "full day of tailored activities for fans," a statement reveals. Additionally, the two companies confirmed that besides the event, a limited-edition line of clothes will also be launched soon.</p>
