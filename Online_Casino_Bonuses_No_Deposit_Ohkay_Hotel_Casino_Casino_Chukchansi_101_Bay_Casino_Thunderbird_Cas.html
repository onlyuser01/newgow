<p>Casino slots and table games supplier Habanero has launched a new Japanese-inspired slot. The studio decided to put the beloved Taiko percussion instruments into the spotlight in the new 5×3 slot release. Following the successful recipe of previous Habanero titles, the new game is packed with free spins, wild symbols scatters, and other special features for a total of 243 ways to win.</p>

<p>Inspiration in Japanese Taiko Drums</p>
<p>The Japanese theme of the new slot has its origins in popular percussion instruments in Japan called Taiko (“drum” in Japanese). The overall design is drenched in golden and red visual elements together with good luck cat symbols and similar fortune items seen laying on the shelves of what appears to be a shop. All five reels are filled with drums and similar percussion instruments, along with Royal symbols. The unique taiko drumming theme is completed by an original game soundtrack. Like many other similar habanero games, the new slot brings a one-of-a-kind modern-day approach to traditional themes. Ranging from sticky multiplier wild symbols, scatters, and free spins, Taiko Beats has a lot to offer.</p>
<p>Habanero’s head of corporate communications Toni Karapetrov described the new game as one that will steer the focus on Taiko drumming “in an entirely new direction.” Karapetrov also called the soundtrack “booming,” explaining how it perfectly blends with the slot’s powerful mathematical model to generate an experience that is fully aligned with the general theme of the game. The new release is expected to meet all the requirements of Habanero’s loyal database of customers.</p>
<p>Up to 28 Free Games</p>
<p>The game features a plethora of sticky Wild Symbols that a player can work on upgrading whenever they land a winning combo while engaged in a Free Games round. The Free Games are exciting to play and they are initiated whenever a minimum of three Scatters land on the grid. The Scatters allow players to significantly multiply their wins. It is possible to scoop up to 28 extra Free Games, with the maximum winning reaching 4,005x the bet.</p>
<p>Lucky Lucky is another Japanese-inspired slot with the popular Japanese cherry blossoms theme at the center released by Habanero in recent years. Similarly, Nine Tails is a Japanese-themed game that introduces players to a modern twist on an ancient Japanese folktale that the same studio released in 2021. Japanese-themed slots are not the only specialty of this successful gaming studio. At the end of July, Habanero released Golden Unicorn Deluxe, a slot with up to 100 free spins, wild symbols, and multipliers. On the last day of May, the studio launched Bomb Runner, an arcade-inspired slot with 707 connected ways to win.</p>
