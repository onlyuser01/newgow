    <h1>New Casino In Las Vegas 50 No Deposit Bonus Casino Extreme Play Casino Games For Real Money Hollywoo</h1>

<p>Through a partnership with the betting solutions and services provider Carrus Gaming, the French next generation sports betting platform, FDJ Gaming Solutions, will provide its digital development platform and image analysis to the Finnish betting agency Veikkaus Oy.</p>
<p>This Will Be The First Time FDJ Has Provided a DDP</p>
<p>The deal will assist Veikkaus Oy in developing a terminal application that will be fully independent of Carrus Gaming’s Elite-S terminals. The Finnish brand will operate, monitor, and update the terminals through the terminal management suite of FDJ Gaming Solutions.</p>
<p>Pascal Blyau, the chief executive officer of FDJ Gaming Solutions France, shared his thoughts on the matter. He explained that this is the first time his company will provide a digital development platform. In his words, the DDP platform “is an open framework using web technologies which accelerates terminal application development, enables dematerialization approaches and seamless integrates to gaming or non-gaming services.”</p>
<p>In yet another first for the company, Blyau revealed that this would also be the first time FDJ has delivered TSM as a service from the cloud.</p>
<p>Carrus Considers The Deal An Important Milestone</p>
<p>Timothée Carrus, the chief executive officer of Groupe Carrus, also spoke about the new deal, calling this contract is “a new success” for Carrus’ Elite range gaming terminals. The chief executive is assured that this move represents an important step for the development of the strategic partnership relationships between his own company and FDJ Gaming Solutions.</p>
<p>Carrus added that the new development attests to the conjoined efforts of both parties and their shared commitment to bringing quality betting content.</p>
<p>“It is a new milestone in our joint success story as we cooperate for more than 20 years delivering over 330,000 lottery terminals worldwide,” Carrus said.</p>
<p>About Veikkaus</p>
<p>Veikkaus is Finland’s national gambling operator, which is responsible for all the betting games in the country. Through the new deal, it will be powered with FDJ’s robust solutions in order to improve the quality that Finnish customers receive.</p>
<p>As is the case with other operators, Veikkaus is committed to high standards and providing the best experience. Similar to its foreign peers, the Finnish operator is committed to ensuring a safe and enjoyable gambling space for inhabitants of the country.</p>
<p>Veikkaus is overseeing the gambling harm in the country and is acting on it when the need arises. The operator recently announced that problem gambling rates have plummeted to 0.8% of Finland’s adult population. The state-owned company recently reduced its workforce by between 125 and 190 workers in the wake of low physical sales.</p>
