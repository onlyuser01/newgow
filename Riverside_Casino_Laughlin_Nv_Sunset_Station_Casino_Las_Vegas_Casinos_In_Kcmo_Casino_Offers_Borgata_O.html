    <h1>Riverside Casino Laughlin Nv Sunset Station Casino Las Vegas Casinos In Kcmo Casino Offers Borgata O</h1>

<p>I spoke with some legal counselors about my issue with this casino and they suggested me to do what I mentioned in my previous post.</p>
<p>As Curacao is part of The Netherlands this would mean that if eventually I end up going to court this would be in The Netherlands with Dutch law, and as this casino was/is licensed with a licensor during the time some of our problems occurred the licensor is supposed to take the cases into consideration.</p>
<p>This is also required as Curacao based licensors are responsible for the behavior of their sub licensees (some court rulings in Curacao confirm this thanks to the SBGOK who started these cases)</p>
<p>If the ruling is in favor of the player the casino is expected to comply, if not it will be a very easy legal case for a judge ðŸ˜‰.</p>
<p>Of course this is theoretically the way it should go, but I might experience the real situation depending on my pending complaint.</p>
<p>Also worth the mention (which is another discussion), two law firms are currently filing court cases against several Maltese casinos for operating illegally in the Netherlands before regulation was set in this country for gambling activities. While Maltese based casinos suspended their operation here Curacao based casinos keep promoting and advertising in the Dutch market as if they are valid to operate here which is a shame I believe.</p>
