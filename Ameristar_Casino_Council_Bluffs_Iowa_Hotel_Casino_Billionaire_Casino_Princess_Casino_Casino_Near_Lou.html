<p>ESA Gaming, a company that has become famous with its EasySwipe ultra-lightweight gaming portfolio, is continuing to grab headlines as the suppliers move forward in Italy with a new content alliance. This time around, the studio has teamed up with Microgame, a leading platform provider, which will now see the supplier’s titles integrated with its core offer.</p>
<p>This is an important step forward for both companies as they seek to garner a competitive edge in the saturated, competitive, but ultimately lucrative Italian iGaming market. To this end, Microgame is seeking to differentiate its offer through the integration of cutting-edge and out-of-the-box titles by ESA Gaming, while the supplier is hoping to strike home with the 55-odd operators that are part of the platform provider’s network.</p>
<p>EasySwipe has already built a name and awareness for its brand, having released a series of well-received titles, including FruitStaxx, Goal Mine, Dragon Mine and Pirate Mine, among others. All of these games have been able to establish themselves as preferred gaming options among players.</p>
<p>Now, Microgame gets to inject them directly into some of the biggest online casino operators in the country. Commenting on this opportunity Microgame Online Product B.U. Director Roberto Russo said that it was exciting to see ESA Gaming’s portfolio integrate with his company’s platform.</p>
<p>"We are committed to delivering exceptional gaming experiences and driving success for all our partners so we are thrilled to grant access to a brand-new library of entertainment and solidify our position as a leading player in Italy's online casino scene," Russo explained.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming Head of Business Development Maria Luisa Malfasi was similarly excited, with the company representative touting the significance of the EasySwipe collection and what it may bring around for players across Microgame’s network.</p>
<p>Microgame is not the only expansion move that ESA Gaming has engaged with over the past several months. The company has similarly singled out prominent operators and approached them directly. In Italy, for example, ESA Gaming has recently signed a content alliance with NetBet, one of the most prominent local operators and providers of gaming experiences.</p>
<p>Apart from Italy, ESA Gaming has been very happy to continue working with established and prominent companies from the iGaming sector, including Videoslots, through a tie-up signed back in July.</p>
<p>As to Microgame, the company has recently struck similar content arrangements with Bragg Gaming Group, Amusnet, and others.</p>
