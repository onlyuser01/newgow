<p>The award-winning software provider for the iGaming industry, Swintt, announced a new exclusive partnership, helping it expand its reach within the Baltic region. On Tuesday, the company revealed it forged a new alliance with the leading Lithuanian online casino platform, 7Bet.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Swintt agreed to supply its fan-favorite slots for the gambling operator. This marks the company’s first entry into the gambling market in Lithuania and at the same time strengthens its presence in the Baltics.</p>
<p>Initially, Swintt’s games will be available exclusively via 7Bet for a period of two months. During that time, the operator will be the only one in the country to be able to offer the developer’s leading slots. This will bring popular games such as Aloha Spirit XtraLockTM and The Crown to new customers, expanding the reach of the content portfolio provided by the leading developer.</p>
<p>Besides the aforementioned games, 7Bet customers will tap into other hits such as Monster Disco XtraHold and Mystic Bear XtraHold, among other popular titles. Lithuanian customers of the operator will also gain access to popular premium games including Book Dino Unlimited, Duolitos Garden, Seven Books Unlimited and Extra Win X.</p>
<p>The Deal Marks an Exciting Moment for 7Bet, Swintt</p>
<p>Justinas Sliazas, 7Bet’s CEO, explained that the company is committed to offering its players engaging and unique casino gambling options. He added that the collaboration with Swintt complements this commitment and helps the company expand its offering. Finally, Sliazas predicted that the new deal will help 7Bet solidify its position within the regulated gambling market in Lithuania.</p>
<p>“By supplying our customers with exclusive access to a selection of Swintt’s most popular slots, we can further cement our position as a true frontrunner in the Lithuanian market while also helping the studio raise its profile in the country – making the collaboration a huge win for everyone involved.“ Justinas Sliazas, CEO at 7Bet</p>
<p>The collaboration with 7Bet isn’t the first one for Swintt within the Baltics region. Previously, the company joined forces with Optibet in Estonia, as well as Latvia. Upon the expiry of the two-month exclusivity period within the partnership with 7Bet, Swintt will be able to forge additional deals with Lithuanian operators.</p>
<p>“Having already enjoyed hugely successful debuts in Estonia and Latvia, we’re delighted to be able to enter the Lithuanian market for the very first time through our exclusive partnership with 7Bet casino.“ David Mann, CEO at Swintt</p>
<p>David Mann, Swintt’s CEO, spoke about the success the company is seen in Latvia and Estonia. Additionally, he acknowledged that Swintt is delighted to enter the market in Lithuania via the deal with 7Bet. Last but not least, Mann predicted that customers of the operator will find the company’s portfolio appealing, given the engaging features and unique themes.</p>
