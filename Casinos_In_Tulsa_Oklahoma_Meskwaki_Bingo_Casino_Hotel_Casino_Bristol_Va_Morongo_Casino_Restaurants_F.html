<p>Entain, a global gaming brand, has expanded its presence in Africa by launching its bwin brand in Zambia. Bwin, which is Entain’s sports betting brand, will make a foray into the country and will nurture Zambia’s sports and tourism sectors.</p>
<p>Entain Launches Bwin in Africa</p>
<p>The Zambian venture was announced at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Lusaka. During a press event, the sportsbook’s parent company announced the launch and vowed to use the opportunity to promote sports and tourism in the country. Bwin has already cleared all required integrations with African network and payment providers Airtel and MTN and is ready to accept bets.</p>
<p>The Entain-owned sportsbook also announced its intentions to promote responsible gambling in the African country. To that end, bwin will recommend BetBlocker, an acclaimed harm prevention and self-exclusion app, to its customers in Zambia. BetBlocker is free for everyone, doesn’t require any registrations and can quickly exclude a customer from all forms of money games.</p>
<p>All and all, Entain aims to continue being a force that impacts society positively. That’s why the company is bullish on boosting tourism rates and supporting the Zambian economy while making sure that gambling harm rates are kept at the absolute minimum. The company’s goal is to run a sustainable business that nurtures the local economy, laying the groundwork for further expansion in the continent.</p>
<p>Zambians Are Going to Love Entain’s Products</p>
<p>Entain first announced its intentions to expand its presence in the continent to its investors. The company informed shareholders that it is eyeing Kenya and Zambia as markets where it may possibly launch its products.</p>
<p>Zambia, where Entain eventually opted to launch, currently allows sports betting, casino gaming and lotteries and has a separate regulatory framework for each of the three verticals. The Zambian Betting Control and Licensing Board is the body responsible for issuing and revoking licenses as per the Betting Control Act.</p>
<p>Spencer Okach, the chief marketing officer for bwin Africa, spoke about the launch. He said that his team is very excited to make a foray into Zambia – a country that is famous for being one of the top regulated gaming jurisdictions in Africa.</p>
<p>Okach said that he is sure customers from the African nation will relish in what the bwin brand has to offer. He said that the brand’s experience paired with a rich selection of betting markets is something that punters in Zambia are sure to love.</p>
<p>Speaking about Entain and sports betting, the company just released data about the most patriotic soccer fans in the world.</p>
