<p>The leading platform, content and service provider, powering betting and gaming operators, OpenBet, announced a new partnership with the Czech Republic lottery operator, Sazka. Announced Thursday, the new collaboration sees the operator strengthen its compliance capabilities with OpenBet’s gambling compliance solutions from Neccton.</p>
<p>Back in July this year, OpenBet announced the acquisition of Neccton. The takeover came at a time when the company sought to bolster its responsible gaming technology and strengthen efforts against fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Sazka marks the first launch for Neccton since the acquisition by OpenBet. Thanks to the new partnership, the operator will benefit from an AI-based solution, strengthening its sportsbook, lottery and casino operations. The new integration significantly enhances Sazka’s compliance efforts and at the same time takes its partnership with OpenBet to a new level.</p>
<p>Pavel Gernt, Sazka’s player protection manager, revealed that offering responsible and fun experiences are prime objectives for the company. He explained that Sazka engages in further protection efforts beyond the established regulations to safeguard its players from harm.</p>
<p>Gernt added: “We are dedicated to prevention, early identification of risky players and cooperation with non-profit institutions that are able to lend a helping hand.” Finally, he spoke about the extensive compliance toolkit offered by Neccton that will further elevate the protection for players at risk.</p>
<p>“Sazka is about fun and responsibility. In addition to complying with all legislation, we also take a number of measures beyond the law.“ Pavel Gernt, player protection manager at Sazka</p>
<p>OpenBet Boosted Its Compliance Capabilities</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Sazka’s collaboration with OpenBet’s Neccton would strengthen its responsible gaming efforts. In fact, Neccton has more than 15 years of experience in developing services and software that caters to the gaming sector and has established its presence in 30 different countries across the globe. Neccton’s products are estimated to analyze 60 billion transactions, monitoring the real-money activities of players from all parts of the world.</p>
<p>“Partnering with Sazka to integrate Neccton’s leading technology across a number of its offerings demonstrates the core reason we expanded our capabilities within the gambling compliance arena.“ Jason Ayton, VP of corporate development and strategy at OpenBet</p>
<p>Jason Ayton, OpenBet’s VP of corporate development and strategy, revealed that the collaboration with Sazka for the integration of the leading technology provided by Neccton confirms why the company boosted its compliance capabilities.</p>
<p>According to him, more gambling operators seek to dedicate additional resources toward compliance, which makes Neccton’s technology a perfect fit. Finally, Ayton said that OpenBet is thrilled to collaborate with more World Lottery Association members and strengthen their compliance while ensuring supreme experiences for their respective players.</p>
