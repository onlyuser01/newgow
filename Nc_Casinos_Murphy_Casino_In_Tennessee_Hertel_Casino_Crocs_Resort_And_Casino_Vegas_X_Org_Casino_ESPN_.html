    <h1>Nc Casinos Murphy Casino In Tennessee Hertel Casino Crocs Resort And Casino Vegas X Org Casino ESPN</h1>

<p>One of the largest TV channels in the United States, ESPN, has announced plans to launch a dedicated sports betting show. Daily Wager will feature an hour-long analysis of the latest developments in the sports betting industry.</p>
<p>ESPN Announces the Daily Wager TV Show</p>
<p>ESPN has revealed its new sports betting show titled “Daily Wager”. The hour-long program will be a breakdown of the latest sports betting trends as well as a quick look-through the legal changes across states.</p>
<p>ESPN’s own famous analyst, Doug Kezirian, will be hosting the show as early as next weekend. You will be able to catch the program on ESPN app as well as via the official website. The imitative is part of the rising profile of the sports betting industry in the United States.</p>
<p>Owned by Disney Company, ESPN has been on a fast-track to expanding its viewership and subscribers. The show successfully reflects customer demands and expectations, ESPN Executive Vice President Norby Williamson believes. He had this to add:</p>
<p>The sports betting environment has changed and interest is increasing at unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>Even though Disney has been opposed to all gambling and betting-related activities in Florida, ESPN has been gradually increasing the professional content discussing the industry and providing insight for sports fans.</p>
<p>ESPN first teased out the possibility for a dedicated show with a number of podcasts that discussed the growing momentum of sports legislation in the US.</p>
<p>The network will rely on its analysts’ expertise paired with the statistically-relevant data sweeps ESPN has been generating as part of its own professional offer. ESPN officially commented on the latest development:</p>
<p>Sports wagering experts will be making picks on the program while ESPN reporters and analysts will provide information and insight but will not be making picks.</p>
<p>ESPN has long been considering to provide more coverage of sports betting, which began intensifying exponentially since PASPA was repealed in May, 2018.</p>
<p>Since that time, ESPN has been running podcasts, news coverage and other content suggesting that any long-term strategy the network assumed would necessarily have to do with covering odds, predictions and the outcome of specific contests.</p>
<p>The new show will focus on providing odds so that sports bettors can make up their minds and place a wager. ESPN’s own writers have long been discussing the future of the sports betting industry. Now, they will be doing it from the comfort of a dedicated studio.</p>
