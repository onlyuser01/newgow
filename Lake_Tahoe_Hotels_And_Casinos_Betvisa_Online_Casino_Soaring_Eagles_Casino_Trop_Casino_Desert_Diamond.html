    <h1>Lake Tahoe Hotels And Casinos Betvisa Online Casino Soaring Eagles Casino Trop Casino Desert Diamond</h1>

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>So I have problem that the 22bet closed my account and I had 975€ on the account.</p>
<p>I have lost some bets at the beginning, then I have won something and I withdrawed the money. They asked for the verification which I have provided and then they made a withdrawal.</p>
<p>With some of the remaining funds I managed to come to around 975€ (I don't know exact number, I think its 974 and few cents) and I requested a withdrawal of 900€ to the same bank account I have previously withdrawn. Then the withdrawal was denied and I was told to contact them via e-mail on security@22bet.com. They wanted me to send a documents one more time, then a bank card and finally a selfie with document and email conversation in the background. After that they asked me if I know some guy called Benjamin, which I don't, and then one guy who has the same name and surname as my brother and my uncle. And I've told them I know 2 persons, one is my uncle and one is my brother.</p>
<p>After that they noticed me that they are closing my gaming account on the basis of General Terms and Conditions of the Bookmaker Company, and I've read this and the only thing I have apparently "violated" is this paragraph;</p>
<p>Each registered customer may have only one account. Customers may register only one account per family, address, e-mail address, IP address, credit/debit card, e-wallet or electronic payment method. Persons otherwise associated with a customer will not be allowed to register on the website.</p>
<p>But how was I supposed to know my brother has an account with their Company, its not like we talk about gambling it is taboo in our country and culture that you gamble. And here it says i will not be allowed to register, why didn't they act earlier when I did my first withdrawal?</p>
<p>Please help me out. I am at your disposal for further information.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Stefan</p>
