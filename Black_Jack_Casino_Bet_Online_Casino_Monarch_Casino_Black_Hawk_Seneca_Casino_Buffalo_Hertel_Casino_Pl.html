<p>Play’n GO has expanded its partnership with Kindred Group through a new content alliance with the latter’s prominent online casino brand, 32Red. The partnership focuses on the iGaming market in the United Kingdom and Play’n GO is the first time that the 32Red and Play’n GO brands have collaborated.</p>
<p>Play’n GO is happy to expand in the United Kingdom which is one of its main markets, with the company already present in 25 jurisdictions, and constantly looking to consolidate its presence in leading markets. 32Red players also stand to benefit, as they will be able to access a number of unique games and titles, including Book of Dead, Boat Bonanza, MegaDon, and many others.</p>
<p>Not least, this new market launch is another way to celebrate the longstanding collaboration between the two companies. Play’n GO Regional Director UK Anna Mackney has welcomed the opportunity and said that the chance to team up with 32Red is another major success for the supplier.</p>
<p>"This is a strategic partnership between two forward-thinking and customer-focused businesses. We’ll be working together closely to make sure we deliver for players," Mackney explained. She was joined by 32Red Commercial Operations ManagerAdam Newnham who also contributed to the official statement.</p>
<p>Newnham said that Kindred Group’s brands have seen Play’n GO as a reliable partner and a driver of their success. This is why bringing a number of Play’n GO’s titles to the UK market was seen as a priority by the group.</p>
<p>Besides, Newnham explained, Play’n GO is constantly expanding its portfolio of products and opportunities that players can benefit from. Both 32Red and Newnham are now looking forward to seeing the impact that the supplier’s games will have on 32Red customers over the coming months.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has been expanding in various markets rapidly, bringing its products to new jurisdictions. The company launched Planetwin365 in the Italian iGaming market and in December, the company expanded in Michigan, the United States.</p>
