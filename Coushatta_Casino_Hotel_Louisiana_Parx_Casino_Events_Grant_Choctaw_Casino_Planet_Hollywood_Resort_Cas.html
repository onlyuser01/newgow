    <h1>Coushatta Casino Hotel Louisiana Parx Casino Events Grant Choctaw Casino Planet Hollywood Resort Cas</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I won 1000 euros with my deposit and when I paid out I was told to do the KYC.</p>
<p>Good 6 files had to be sent.</p>
<p>1) ID</p>
<p>2) bank card</p>
<p>3) Skrill acc e***at@gmail.com</p>
<p>3.1) Skrill acc at***s@gmail.com</p>
<p>3.2) Neteller acc e***at@gmail.com</p>
<p>4) A selfie with ID and ggbet accountID</p>
<p>Now I had uploaded everything correctly, but no document was accepted from it. But I'm sure that I did everything right and that everything was recognizable.</p>
<p>Then I asked customer support why the documents had not been accepted.</p>
<p>Answers were as follows:</p>
<p>1) All four corners cannot be seen on the ID photo and some information is hidden.</p>
<p>However, all four corners are clearly visible in the photo and I covered the serial number except for two characters because it said so!</p>
<p>2) Collages are not accepted for bank card photos, some info is hidden.</p>
<p>I made a back and front collage because you only uploaded one document. And according to the statement, I have hidden some information correctly! After this answer, the support wrote me (screenshot available) that one page of the card is enough. But the specification says FRONT AND BACK.</p>
<p>3) no information, although everything was clear and uploaded as specified.</p>
<p>4) not specified, although everything was clearly recognizable.</p>
<p>So I don't know what to do, I feel like they're playing with me..</p>
