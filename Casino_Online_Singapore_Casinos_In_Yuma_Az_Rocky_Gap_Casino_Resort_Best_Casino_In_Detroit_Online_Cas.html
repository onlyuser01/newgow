<p>Game distributor platform QTech Games has expanded its clout and diversity in the Asian region by adding products by Spribe, an up-and-coming supplier and developer of innovative iGaming experiences. Spribe has built a name for itself in the “crash” game genre, developing various original twists to the traditional iGaming experience.</p>
<p>A Chance to Crash, a Chance to Win</p>
<p>A crash game essentially asks players to make a bet and exit a race before their mode of transportation “crashes.” Each game has various storylines, from space shuttles to race cars. The further someone lingers, the more money they stand to win. QTech is happy to take up this opportunity as it would seek to deploy Spribe’s own hit title in the genre, Aviator. QTech Games CCO Ulf Norder has welcomed the news:</p>
<p>“In today’s marketplace, only premium games of the highest standard separate you from the crowd, so we’re delighted to see how Spribe has fulfilled this demand, above all with its engaging crash games like Aviator.” QTech Games CCO Ulf Norder</p>
<p>The idea behind Aviator is to have a multiplayer experience that can “crash” at any time and payout based on how far you have made it before calling it quits. If you crash, though, your money for that round is lost. Norder added that Spribe is a pioneer in developing and introducing the crash format to both crypto and regular casinos. As a reminder, QTech Games recently introduced crypto payment support for the games it aggregates.</p>
<p>While Spribe is adopting this original concept and introducing players of all its partner casinos to this new mode of play, the company is far from the only one who has been experimenting with the concept. Other companies, including FunFair Technologies, have introduced games based on the crash mechanic, namely Astroboomers: To The Moon! Spribe dedicates its time to developing new and immersive gamification for the iGaming experience.</p>
<p>The addition to QTech Games’ platform comes along with other top-notch integrations. Spribe’s products will be available next to those of Evolution and Yggdrasil. Spribe’s own success is visible on a regulatory level as well. The company has secured several licenses, including from the UK Gambling Commission and the Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>Spribe also has a Class 2 License in Romania and it has been expanding its reach. The current collaboration with QTech would enable the supplier to reach even new markets and untapped jurisdictions. Spribe head of product Shalva Bukia welcomed the opportunity to be joining QTech and argued that Spribe remains committed to “reinvigorating the slots space with new kinds of social multiplayer games.”</p>
<p>“Teaming up with QTech represents a fantastic opportunity to bolster our product distribution across emerging markets in Asia and deliver our great games to a range of top-tier partners,” Bukia concluded.</p>
