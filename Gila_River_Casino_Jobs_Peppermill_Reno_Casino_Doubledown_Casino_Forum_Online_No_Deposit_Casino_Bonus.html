    <h1>Gila River Casino Jobs Peppermill Reno Casino Doubledown Casino Forum Online No Deposit Casino Bonus</h1>

<p>Hello Casino Guru,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, i was unlucky enough to find your website and trusted your " perfect reputation " ratings, and register in Malina Casino.</p>
<p>I wish i paid attention on the people's feedback instead because you as an affiliate obviously been paid to promote this SCAM casino.</p>
<p>I registered this Saturday ( 4th of March ) , deposited 3 times ( cash, no bonuses) , and got lucky, basically end up winning 1K and could request WD only 500 Euro because this is the ridiculous limits they have ( 500 euro per 24 hours ) I didn't expect anything on Sunday , its normal practise for alot of small casinos to approve WDs on Mondays. So on Monday i received e-mail with cancelation and words that they cant proceed WD on Revolut card , i was thinking xmm weird, they approve deposits from it, but not WD? okey okey, so luckily i have another card ...I requested it again with new card and next day got an e-mail from KYC that my WD was canceled, now attention...the reason of cancelation was " Please resubmit withdrawal request again " after this one i felt already something dodgy going on and i get in touch with customer support, and oh my god, the Customer support just keep copy paste me message that i need to wait up to 5 days ...the responses were so unprofessional and unlogic that i start to understand its a scam place who couldn't even afford normal customer support ,robot would do better job, also i realized they delaying process un purpose and hoping that im going to keep playing while i have issues to WD money, lose the whole amount, this is basic strategy for alot of small casinos. I requested my WD for the 3rd time...and after 2 days got another cancelation with the e-mail and explanation " Please resubmit with a different IBAN" . But that's not it, now...there is not even option for me to WD money to the bank , its magically disappeared, only some e- wallets left ( check prinscreen) When i contacted support her answer was " Please note that the availability of Wds methods are subject to change ! Also she asked me to wait AGAIN of course as Financial department should get in touch with me asap( no explanation that they have technical issues or something, no clarity, nothing ) ... it was an early morning, ofcourse nobody get in touch, now evening, and tomorrow Friday...im not going to be na√Øve here...i know where its going . I work myself in gaming industry for 14 years, never ever wrote a bad review or were dealing with things like that, Im in shock, but im going to invest my time and effort, bring all my gaming connections ( and its a HUGE community ) , go to askgamblers and so on. So i guess its just a beginning. Lets see if you can help somehow with this , however you were the ones who promoted them...</p>
