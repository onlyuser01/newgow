    <h1>Casinos In Destin Florida The Durango Casino Palace Casino Casino World Free Spotlight Casino Tulsa</h1>

<p>Look... I'm an avid player, who's played in more than 10 houses already, and I've never had problems with documentation/withdrawal. I did the step by step and I'm finding it time consuming to approve my withdrawal (08/25) I applied for it, and still nothing, they asked me for a document/ proof of address and they approved it, then a selfie holding the driver's license in the morning, I promptly sent it, today 08/29 they approved it, and asked for a notarized copy of the document, with a stamp and signature, I went to the notary, paid and sent it.</p>
<p>Now in the house chats, they tell me that yes, everything is fine with the documents, but there are delays in payments, to wait .. And that they have nothing to do with who makes the payment and with Kyc .. I don't know They give me some deadline.. I'm already desperate.. Because I even spent the money I had, counting on this to buy my motorcycle to work, this money is very important to me! They no longer respond to email.</p>
<p>Note: I only have one account, on the same cell phone, I never asked for or accepted any bonuses..</p>
<p>I'm totally within the rules, just waiting for the notarized document to be approved and the withdrawal!</p>
