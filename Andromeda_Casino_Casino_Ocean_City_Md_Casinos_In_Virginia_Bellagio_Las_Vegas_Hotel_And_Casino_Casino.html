<p>Greentube, an iGaming and entertainment company, has reinforced its business in North America with the acquisition of the Present Creative development studio. The new addition boosts Greentube’s presence in the region as the company seeks US expansion.</p>
<p>Greentube Expands in NA</p>
<p>The United States has cemented itself as one of the fastest-growing markets. As a result, Greentube prioritizes its growth in the region and greatly boosted its local offering over the last year. The acquisition of Present Creative will further boost the company’s foothold in the region, helping it become one of the local powerhouses.</p>
<p>The agreement will arm Greentube with a local team that is very experienced in game design and sales. The acquisition will also be beneficial for Present Creative as it will now have Greentube’s backing and will be able to roll out content at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Greentube has operated in the US for over a year now. The producer joined the local market in September 2021 and is currently live in New Jersey and in Michigan. In addition, Greentube now holds a license to operate in Ontario, Canada, which further reinforces the company’s NA footprint.</p>
<p>Present Creative is known as a producer of exciting iGaming and iLottery content. Its experienced team has a proven track record in the real-money and casual gaming sectors and has demonstrated its capabilities of creating original and innovative games. A few such titles were recently approved for launch by the Michigan State Lottery.</p>
<p>Present Creative Is Happy to Join the Greentube Family</p>
<p>Michael Bauer, Greentube’s chief financial officer, shared that his team is thrilled to announce the new acquisition. According to him, Present Creative is a perfect fit for Greentube, thanks to its strong experience in developing great iGaming titles.</p>
<p>The US is a market of great importance to us, and we have bold plans to become a leading supplier in the region. This acquisition will propel that expansion. Michael Bauer, CFO, Greentube</p>
<p>Present Creative’s co-founder and chief executive, Ben Sutherland, added that his team is excited to join the Greentube family. He added that the new M&amp;A deal will allow his company to speed up its development process and elevate its content.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic opportunity for Present Creative and we look forward to working closely with Greentube to bring exciting new content to local players through their impressive operator network. Ben Sutherland, CEO, Present Creative</p>
<p>Last month, Greentube also expanded its presence in Italy with Scommettendo, a local iGaming brand.</p>
