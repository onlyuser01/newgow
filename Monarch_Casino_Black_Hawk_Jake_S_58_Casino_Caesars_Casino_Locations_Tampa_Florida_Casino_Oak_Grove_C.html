<p>Betsoft has expanded its presence in the Belgium gaming and iGaming market by signing a new agreement with PepperMill Casino, assisting the company’s expansion online.</p>
<p>As a result, Betsoft will provide the property with a number of its award-winning and player-favorite games, including Thai Blossoms, 88 Frenzy Fortune, and Return to Paris. Betsoft uses a distinct design and game-development style that make its products immediately recognizable and desirable titles to try and play.</p>
<p>Betsoft Leans Harder on Belgium iGaming Presence</p>
<p>Betsoft stands to benefit from this tie-up as it enables the provider to continue showcasing its capabilities in the country, and potentially reach similar agreements with other companies.</p>
<p>Betsoft is also making sure to offer bespoke solutions that are translated and specifically tailored for the Belgium market, making the country an important pivot of Betsoft’s broader strategy in Europe. Commenting on this opportunity, Betsoft head of account management Anna Mackney said:</p>
<p>Reinforcing our footprint across newly regulated European countries is part of our strategic development plan. Betsoft head of account management Anna Mackney</p>
<p>The executive added that the company was looking forward to partnering with PepperMill Casino and the two forge a great relationship that enables them to move forward with their respective offers. PepperMill Casino is mostly a land-based casino that has only recently begun shifting towards the digital space.</p>

<p>The casino is represented in Belgium as well as the Netherlands, where it was originally founded. The shift towards digital was boosted by the fact that since November 2021, its home jurisdiction is also allowing digital operations.</p>
<p>PepperMill Casino CEO Anthony Rus is confident that Betsoft brings a distinct variety to the table and makes the property’s expansion in iGaming more tenable:</p>
