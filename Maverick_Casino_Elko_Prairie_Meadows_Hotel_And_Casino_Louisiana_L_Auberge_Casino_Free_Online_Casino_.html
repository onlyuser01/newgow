<p>The companies believe that affiliates have a responsibility to balance between effective marketing and customer protection</p>
<p>Six like-minded US affiliates have joined forces to form the Responsible Gambling Affiliate Association (RGAA). The newly created body’s job will seek to help affiliate companies serve the online gambling market in a responsible way.</p>
<p>The RGAA is comprised of six major affiliates, including Better Collective, Catena Media, Gambling.com, Oddschecker Global Media, Spotlight Sports Group and XLMedia. The six companies believe that affiliates have a responsibility to promote safer gambling and balance between effective marketing and customer protection.</p>
<p>The RGAA acknowledges the current regulations but believes that improvements can be made. It has organized its goals into five strategic pillars, including the promotion of competitive gambling markets, industry education, consumer protection, advertising codes of conduct and responsible business practices.</p>
<p>The RGAA is currently searching for a permanent president who will represent the organization as it seeks to shape the future of affiliate marketing. The organization promised to release a notification as soon as it makes an appointment.</p>
<p>Executives Are Excited about the RGAA</p>
<p>Representatives of the six affiliate companies comprising the RGAA released statements on the matter.</p>
<p>Mark Frank Pedersen, Better Collective’s chief executive officer of NA said that his team is doing everything possible to empower the industry and promote gambling as entertainment. He praised the opportunity to join forces with other affiliates and promote better standards and guidelines.</p>
<p>Not only is this the right thing to do for our customers, it’s the best thing to ensure the success and longevity of the industry and our businesses. Mark Frank Pedersen, CEO, Better Collective</p>
<p>Michael Daly, Catena Media’s chief executive officer, also commented on the matter, highlighting the ever-changing nature of the US market. He said that Catena Media is proud to be one of RGAA’s founding members and promote responsible and positive wagering experiences alongside other affiliates that share the same values.</p>
<p>Charles Gillespie, Gambling.com’s CEO, on the other hand, noted that all shareholders in the US iGaming market must understand the critical role of affiliates in helping operators grow. He added that his team is proud to be part of the RGAA and set higher standards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oddschecker’s CEO, Stuart Simms, said that consumers are at the heart of everything his team does. Because of that, he is glad to join forces with the other founding members of the RGAA and promote social responsibility. He said that his ambition is that the RGAA will “support fair play for all.”</p>
<p>Mark Renshaw, Spotlight Sports Group’s CEO, also expressed his thoughts, noting that his team has always been at the forefront of responsible gambling.</p>
<p>We are extremely proud to be a founding member of the Responsible Gambling Affiliate Association, which I believe will play a key role in ensuring the highest standards are set among the affiliate industry. Mark Renshaw, CEO, Spotlight Sports Group</p>
<p>Last but not least, David King, XLMedia’s CEO, commented on the matter. He noted that affiliates play a critical role in providing consumers with choice while supporting regulated operators.</p>
