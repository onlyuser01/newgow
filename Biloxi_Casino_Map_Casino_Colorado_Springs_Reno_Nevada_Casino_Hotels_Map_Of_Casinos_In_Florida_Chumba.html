<p>Spribe has received approval to launch its world-leading crash game Aviator in Ontario after getting a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario</p>
<p>The company that offers next-generation, engaging games for the iGaming industry will make its hit crash game accessible to operators in the Ontario region. The game has already gathered a massive database of over five million players worldwide and its newly obtained license in the Canadian province will now allow it to reach even more players.</p>
<p>The Ontario License, “a Big Moment” for Spribe</p>
<p>Spribe’s managing partner David Natroshvili spoke about the freshly secured license for Ontario, describing it as a “big moment” for the company. He also mentioned their expectations for the Canadian market to fully embrace the hit crash game along with the rest of their popular titles found in their portfolio.</p>
<p>Natroshvili also expressed their eagerness to partner with local operators in the Ontario market and keep watching Aviator grow and become more successful than any other of the available games there.</p>
<p>With over 60 online casinos operating in Ontario’s legal iGaming market that opened one year ago, players are given thousands of excellent slots and table game options.</p>
<p>Spribe is constantly upgrading its releases following the freshest trends in the online gambling industry while focusing on building state-of-the-art products that create a powerful impact on players and operators alike.</p>
<p>Ontario operators can also expect to benefit from the same type of gross gaming revenue growth and the rest of the opportunities that other operators have benefitted from when including the game in their libraries.</p>
<p>What Makes Aviator So Successful?</p>
<p>The company that specializes in the development of iGaming software development and casino management released the game in 2018. Ever since, the simplicity of the game, its full-player controls, and the possibility of scooping up massive wins have turned it into an undeniable hit game for many operators. ever since its launch in 2018.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of a new round, the player needs to place a bet and wait for the plane to take off and climbs high into the sky. Then, as the plane does down, a Multiplier is seen growing. The longer the player can hold on, the more they can win.</p>
<p>However, in the event of the plane flying away prior to cashing out the wins, the player loses its accrued winnings along with the original stake.</p>
<p>The high level of interactivity, the possibility to opt for multiplayer mode, the chance to watch the scores in real-time on a dedicated leaderboard, and the unlockable bonuses including the Free Games part of the Rain Promo turn Aviator into such a successful game with a large number of casinos.</p>
<p>The device’s compatibility with all devices and operating systems also make it an excellent choice for mobile players on the go.</p>
<p>In February, Spribe announced signing a content agreement with SKS365, providing the latter’s Planetwin365 online casino with Aviator.</p>
