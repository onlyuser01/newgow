    <h1>Wild Casino Review Parker Az Casino Casino Costumes Chumba Casino Login Bonus Wisconsin Casinos Map</h1>

<p>I posted a full review of this casino, but this situation now requires a public complaint. I sent in verification documents before making larger deposits. I have deposited well over $2,000 and finally cashed out $5,000 after receiving a $1,000 chip from my host. I beat the $25,000 wager requirements somehow. I have chatted in multiple times, spoken to my VIP host, and been promised that they'd get right back to me and verify my documents right away. None of that has happened. Today, I receive an email from an account manager with the following, in part:</p>
<p>"We hope this message finds you well. We are writing to inform you that unfortunately, our security department has been unable to accept the passport you provided to verify your account.</p>
<p>Please understand that the verification process is crucial to maintaining a safe and secure environment for all our players, and we take it very seriously. However, we cannot accept any document that we suspect to be fake."</p>
<p>I responded that it is a federal crime, a felony, to even possess a false US passport. They temporarily closed my account until this issue can be resolved and asked for additional ID. In response, I sent multiple photos of different angles of my passport WITH stamps from multiple countries. Obviously, I could not travel around the world with a fake passport. This is a tactic to not pay me and I am livid. Moreover, I told them that I'd have my passport verified by the US embassy closest to them.</p>
<p>Accusing someone of possessing a falsified passport is absolute insanity. Moreover, they have my electricity bill and a selfie with me holding my valid US passport. I'm begging you guys to please do something about this mess. I am in shock that their security team would even respond with this craziness.</p>
