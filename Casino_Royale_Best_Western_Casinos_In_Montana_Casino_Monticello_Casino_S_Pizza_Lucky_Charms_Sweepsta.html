<p>Cat Clans 2: Mad Cats review</p>
<p>The Cat Clans 2: Mad Cats online slot from Snowborn Games is a sequel to the Cat Clans slot released by the same developer. The slot focuses on a group of cats who are surviving in some sort of dystopian, Mad-Max-style future.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The original Cat Clans slot was set in the medieval period, but Snowborn has decided to shift gear for the sequel. The game is now set in the middle of a desert, in a time where it looks as though humanity has used up its resources, with tuna and oil both being essential to survival. It brings all of this to life with a really colorful and fun design. The cats are given creative, quirky makeovers, and the slot has a really jovial and enjoyable feeling.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game of the slot keeps the action quite simple.</p>
<p>It uses a five-by-three grid with twenty fixed paylines on each spin. Wins are made when players land matching symbols of three or more across a payline.</p>
<p>The controls are all located under the reels, with a burger menu opening up the paytable and other key information.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is a good range of bonuses on offer in Cat Clans 2: Mad Cats. The first you will probably notice is the Wild Grenade symbols that have Multipliers attached. These can land on any spin and have multipliers up to x5 in the base game, and x10 in the bonus rounds.</p>
<p>There is a Mystery Box symbol that can land on a spin. This works the same as any standard Mystery Symbol bonus, with multiple instances revealing themselves to be matching. There are also cash symbols that can land rewarding prizes up to x50.</p>
<p>These also play a part in the Mad Respins bonus. This is triggered by collecting Paw Overlay symbols. During the round, only Mystery Boxes and blank symbols land on the reels. Each time a symbol hits, the respins continue. At the end of the round, all of the boxes are opened, and any wins are added up and paid out.</p>
<p>Landing three, four, or five Scatters triggers the corresponding number of free spins. During the round, known as Furry Spins, Wilds are sticky, and when you land one, it will reset the spin count. During the round, Multipliers on a random Wild are boosted by one on each spin.</p>
<p>The slot also has a Features Shop, which allows players to buy their way into the bonus features.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The Cat Clans 2: Mad Cats RTP sits at 96%, which is the industry average according to our slot strategy guide. Players can get their hands on a 20,000x maximum win, though the game does not state how this is won.</p>
<p>The slot is considered highly volatile.</p>
<p>The slotâ€™s betting range is $0.20 to $25, though, this could vary between casinos.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Cat Clans 2: Mad Cats makes several changes from the original Cat Clans slot, most notably its theme, but it also keeps several gameplay features intact. There is a lot to like about the game, especially the bonus features, with the respins round and the Wild-focused Furry spins offering some nice sequences and keeping the gameplay varied.</p>
