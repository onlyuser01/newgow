    <h1>Mesquite Nv Casinos Casino Mania Real Money Longhorn Casino Hotel Casino Roland Cherry Gold Casino C</h1>

<p>On December 5, I made four withdrawals from the Cryptobetsports casino, a total of 8099.54 euros. For some reason, the withdrawals could not fit into the same withdrawal request.</p>
<p>I haven't used the bonus.</p>
<p>Cryptobetsports casino says that the processing of the withdrawal request takes 48 hours, several days have passed without a payment.</p>
<p>I have tried many times to contact the support team. The support team keeps promising things, always saying they will forward the matter to the finance department and that my withdrawal request will be processed very soon, but has yet to keep any of their promises.</p>

<p>I contacted Cryptobetsports customer service many times.</p>
<p>First, on December 5th, I contacted Cryptobetsports casino. I asked when will my withdrawals arrive in my crypto account? they answered:</p>
<p>"Withdrawals can take up to 48 hours please be patient our team will be on it very soon"</p>
<p>The next time I contacted Cryptobetssports casino was on December 7th, when almost 48 hours had passed since all my withdrawal requests. I asked if my withdrawal will arrive in my crypto account on the same day when 48 hours have passed. They answered:: "Sure, it should be performed shortly!" and "The team will start handling all withdrawals today"</p>
<p>I contacted Cryptobetsports casino again the same evening on December 7 and asked again when my withdrawal would be paid to my crypto account because more than 48 hours had passed.</p>
<p>They replied that "Withdrawals take up to 72 hours to process"</p>
<p>I told them that previously they told me that the withdrawal takes 48 hours. They answered "Due to high traffic of withdrawals it might take up a little longer please be patient and rest assured it will be processed soon!"</p>
<p>Then a third time again later in the evening on December 7th, I asked if they will pay me all my withdrawals today or tomorrow? They answered "Withdraws requests can take up to 1-2 days to be processed"</p>
<p>I told them that I had made all my withdrawal requests two days ago and asked if they would pay all my withdrawals today or tomorrow. They answered:: "Please be patient until tomorrow and your funds will arrive to you"</p>
<p>On December 8, I was connected to Cryptobetsports casino again.</p>
<p>I asked, is my money coming to my crypto account today and I told them that they had promised me earlier that they would pay my all withdrawals today.</p>
<p>They answered "Please be patient our team will be on your withdrawal requests very soon I apologize for this delay caused"</p>
<p>I asked, will the processing of my withdrawal request be delayed further? They said they can't give an exact time, but they will inform the team to check and deal with it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>They also said: "Due to some traffic of withdrawals lately it has been delayed so please be patient until later or check back tomorrow to us if it hasn't been processed so we can let our team know for this case so they can confirm it" I replied that I would get back to you the next day if my withdrawal requests were not processed by the next day.</p>
