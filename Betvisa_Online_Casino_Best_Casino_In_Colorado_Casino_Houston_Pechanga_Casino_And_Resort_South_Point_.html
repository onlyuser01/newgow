<p>Bulgaria’s National Revenue Agency (NRA), the country’s government department responsible for the regulation of gambling, announced that self-excluded people are not be allowed to work for casino companies.</p>
<p>According to the NRA, people who are included in the country’s newly-introduced self-exclusion register are prohibited from working with gambling operators. Employers must also adhere to a special norm outlined in Bulgaria’s gambling laws, the NRA noted.</p>
<p>As announced by the agency, gambling companies that violate this rule and employ self-excluded people risk a fine of between 5,000 and 20,000 Bulgarian leva (around $2,800-$11,250).</p>
<p>For reference, the NRA also prohibits people in the national self-exclusion register from entering gambling establishments. Armed people, uniformed people and minors also may not enter a casino, as well as people without ID or those under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>Operators are required to make sure that the players they allow on the premises of gambling properties are not self-excluded. Bulgaria’s national register, however, is not public and is available only to certain NRA members and operators that request access for safer gambling purposes.</p>
<p>Thousands of Bulgarian Players Are Excluded from Gambling</p>
<p>Bulgaria re-launched its national self-exclusion program in December, 2022, allowing Bulgarian citizens to exclude themselves from gambling for two or more years. The NRA invites people who believe themselves to be high-risk customers or problem players to sign up in the register and shield themselves from gambling.</p>
<p>To do so, players must visit a NRA office and fill in a document or sent the document digitally to the NRA’s official email address. Players can learn more about the register on the NRA’s official website.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the list of self-excluded persons continues to grow, according to the agency. Recent data shows that some 11,500 people are excluded from gambling now. This figure is based on data collected in June, 2023, and represents a significant growth from the 7,000 excluded people recorded in April, 2023.</p>
<p>Bulgaria’s Gaming Market Looks Promising</p>
<p>Bulgaria’s budding gaming market makes the country an attractive destination for international operators and suppliers. This is underscored by the high number of companies seeking to expand their footprint in the Balkan country.</p>
<p>Just now, Kaizen teamed up with 7777 gaming, agreeing to power its Betano Bulgaria brand with content. Prior to that, Spinomenal teamed up with Palms Bet and Alphawin, expanding its presence in the country.</p>
<p>Palms Bet, on the other hand, also secured solutions from Altenar.</p>
