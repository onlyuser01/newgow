<p>Baltimore Coming Off an Overtime Win on Monday Night</p>
<p>The Ravens didn’t have the best of the nights on Monday when they welcomed the Indianapolis Colts at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. They didn’t play particularly well and should be thankful that their mistakes didn’t get punished.</p>
<p>The score was 25-25 in the regulation, but just four seconds before the whistle, the Colts had a chance to win the game with a field goal. Unfortunately for them, their placekicker missed the attempt. The punishment came a couple of minutes later when Marquise Brown scored the winning TD for the Ravens.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, he scored it following a pass from Lamar Jackson. The Ravens QB had a fantastic game, with 37 successful passes of 43 attempted ones, for 442 yards, and four TDs.</p>
<p>With Jackson in such a fantastic form, Baltimore fans should feel very excited about what’s coming next. They’re entering the game with the Chargers as the favorite, but this shouldn’t mean too much as the LA team is famous for being a giant slayer.</p>
<p>The Chargers Looks Lethal in the Offense</p>
<p>In the first couple of weeks of the 2021 NFL season, everyone was talking about how good the Chargers were in defense. After all, we saw them stopping Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs from scoring more than 24 points in Round 3.</p>
<p>However, in Week 5, it was their offense that brought them the win over the Cleveland Browns. We saw the Chargers scoring 47 points in that game, which was five more than the opponent.</p>
<p>Can they continue scoring a lot? Probably not, as the Ravens are known as a defensive-minded team. Still, the visitors will probably be able to sneak a couple of TDs in. Will that be enough for them to add another win to the record?</p>
<p>Probably not, as Jackson and his teammates will likely score more judging by how well they’ve been playing so far.</p>
<p>Pick: Baltimore Ravens to win and cover the spread; over to hit.</p>
