<p>Vivo Gaming has issued an update via email in which the company, which specializes in the delivery of outstanding live casino products, offered a breakdown of its operations in the Latin American market. The report covers the last 12 months of operations and outlines some of Vivo Gaming’s most significant achievements in the market.</p>
<p>According to Vivo Gaming’s update, the company has been able to receive a GLI certification for multiple of its flagship games, which has given a significant boost to its newly opened studio properties in Uruguay and Colombia. Not only that, but the company has been able to expand its offices and operational hubs in Central and South America, the update says.</p>
<p>Presently, the company has operational hubs that work out of São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Bogotá, and not least Costa Rica. The company has been similarly forging ahead with new hires, with more than 30 new corporate members of the staff joining.</p>
<p>On the B2C end, Vivo Gaming has also been hiring a number of live dealers who speak Spanish, Portuguese and English, and the company has been adding studio managers and technicians to ensure that it offers the highest quality of live casino games possible in Latin America and beyond.</p>
<p>Presently, Vivo Gaming is working with more than 40 clients who are more than happy to utilize the full range of solutions provided by the company. Vivo for its part is fully committed to becoming the de facto leader in the live gaming segment in Latin America as it hopes to interact with a vibrant player base and secure more ground from other global live gaming behemoths.</p>
<p>Neil Howells, the company’s CCO, has hailed the success Vivo Gaming has achieved in Latin America over the past 12 months. He argued that the company is in a particularly strong position to reap further success as more jurisdictions in Latin America are only now figuring out their online gaming regulatory framework which will undoubtedly translate into long-term success.</p>
<p>To make sure that the company is prepared, though, Howells says that Vivo Gaming is constantly on the lookout for new products and solutions that give it a distinct edge over the competition. Meanwhile, clients have been very happy with Vivo Gaming’s product offering and technology, hailing the company for allowing them to stand out and boost their product offerings with player audiences in Latin America.</p>
