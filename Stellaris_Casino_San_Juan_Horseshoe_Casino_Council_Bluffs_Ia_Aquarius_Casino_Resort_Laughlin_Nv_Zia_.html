    <h1>Stellaris Casino San Juan Horseshoe Casino Council Bluffs Ia Aquarius Casino Resort Laughlin Nv Zia</h1>

<p>After a year-long renovation, Horseshoe Las Vegas, formerly Bally's, opened its doors for visitors at a glamorous grand opening ceremony that took place Friday. The opening of the venue marked the return of the iconic Horseshoe brand on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>The Horseshoe Casino brand has a rich history dating back to 1951. Famous as a casino brand by a gambler for gamblers, Horseshoe continues to follow the tradition by offering unique experiences via no-limit betting options. Currently, Caesars Entertainment operates ten different Horseshoe properties around North America and now, one on the famous Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>The flashy official grand opening included showgirls wearing original Jubilee! costumes, as well as confetti cannons. Moreover, during the event, Jack Binion, the businessman and casino owner whose family opened the original Horseshoe casino in Las Vegas, gifted Caesars Entertainment's leadership team a unique horseshoe from his family ranch.</p>
<p>A special reception for a select list of guests took place at Jack Binionâ€™s Steak. The event was led by the Vice President of the World Series of Poker (WSOP), Jack Effel, and included a Q&amp;A panel with famous people from the industry. The philanthropist Jim "Mattress Mack" McIngvale, the Poker Hall of Fame Inductee, Doyle Brunson, as well as Jack Binion, were among the panelists of the event, a statement released by Caesars Entertainment reveals.</p>
<p>The opening of Horseshoe Las Vegas also brought thrill for poker fans. Caesars confirmed that the WSOP will return to Horseshoe Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas starting from May 30, 2023. The 54th annual edition of the tournament is scheduled to run through July 18, 2023.</p>
<p>The return of the event further builds upon the rich legacy of the Horseshoe brand, considering that the first WSOP tournament was played at the original Horseshoe Casino in downtown Las Vegas back in 1970.</p>
<p>Much is expected from this year's event, given its popularity and the rich heritage of the Horseshoe brand. Last year's edition of the tournament saw nearly 198,000 participants from 100 countries around the world. The entrants helped build a record-breaking $347.9 million total prize pool, reaffirming the popularity and interest in the WSOP.</p>
<p>Jason Gregorec, Horseshoe Las Vegas' SVP and General Manager, shared his excitement saying: "The arrival of Horseshoe on The Strip marks a significant moment for Caesars Entertainment, the Horseshoe name and the entire destination." Finally, he pointed out: "Not only are we excited for guests to experience the redesigned resort and its latest offerings, but we are also proud to reintroduce the historic gaming brand to Las Vegas."</p>
