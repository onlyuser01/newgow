<p>Leading betting operator BetMGM has just launched its mobile horseracing app BetMGM Horse Racing in two more states. The application is live in Florida and Louisiana and will allow local bettors to follow hundreds of racetracks worldwide.</p>
<p>BetMGM Goes Live In Florida and Louisiana</p>
<p>With the two new states, BetMGM Horse Racing is live in a total of three states. Bettors who own an Android or iOS phone will have thousands of betting opportunities at the tip of their fingers. They can benefit from the application’s wide variety of racing offerings, which cover more than 200 racetracks across the globe. Some of the most notable tracks, covered by BetMGM’s app include Aqueduct Racetrack, Gulfstream Park, and Santa Anita Park.</p>
<p>The application will also allow fans to watch various racing content, including live broadcasts and replays. Punters will also get access to various exclusive betting opportunities on various events taking place both in the United States and internationally.</p>
<p>For USA-based events, BetMGM Horse Racing covers the Belmont Stakes, the Breeders’ Cup World Championship, the Pegasus World Cup, the Preakness Stakes, and the Saratoga Race Course summer event. As for international events, BetMGM users will get to experience Melbourne Cup, Royal Ascot, Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, and The Grand National.</p>
<p>The Launch is an Important Step for BetMGM</p>
<p>BetMGM’s horseracing application is powered by NYRA Bets’ online solutions. The latter is the official wagering platform of the New York Racing Association and is a major horseracing content provider. Through its solutions, BetMGM will ensure that users of its Horse Racing app will get only the best of horseracing betting content.</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of the company, spoke on the launch of BetMGM Horse Racing in Florida and Louisiana. Greenblatt said that this is an important move for the future of the company and that it “sets the stage for BetMGM to engage with a new customer base in the South.</p>
<p>For Greenblatt, the expansion of the app is a key part of BetMGM’s overall expansion to new markets. He hopes that the launch of the horseracing mobile app in Florida and Louisiana will accelerate the company’s growth going into 2022.</p>
<p>December has been an eventful month for BetMGM. Not only did the company successfully launch bingo content in New Jersey but it also managed to extend many of its crucial partnerships. Some of them include its deal with the PGA Tour and the agreement with the Vegas Golden Knights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, BetMGM and Sports Alerts recently teamed up with Inside Edge to launch a new product called My Inside Edge.</p>
