    <h1>Rodeway Inn Near Ybor City Casino Margaritaville Casino Shreveport Windstar Casino Hotel Parkwest Ca</h1>

<p>Hello.I'm a player from Germany.Unfortunately I couldn't change the country where I live.</p>
<p>This casino is the perfection of cheating the player.</p>
<p>All winnings are capped.</p>
<p>Withdrawals canceled against 99% lost without a chance.</p>
<p>Although they have a Malta license, they are not allowed to offer games on the German market because there is no German license.</p>
<p>I ask Casino Guru if you can recover the losses because you are illegal in the German market?</p>
<p>When I asked for the German license in live chat, my account was simply closed.</p>
<p>I have written several emails that have gone unanswered.</p>
<p>What I've experienced here is the very last. They don't care how a player is ripped off.</p>
<p>There were no free spins on Book of Dead or Legacy of Dead for several days.</p>
<p>I emailed the casino to reimburse me for the damage caused because they are not allowed to offer any games in Germany. There is simply no response.</p>
<p>As a player, do I have a right to compensation?</p>
<p>Made the deposit via PayPal.</p>
<p>Is it advisable to get the money back via PayPal?</p>
<p>My conclusion. Don't play in the casinos that are online. It's 98% fraud. Unfortunately, I had to make this bad experience.</p>
<p>Onestepcasino is the very last and should lose its license immediately.</p>
