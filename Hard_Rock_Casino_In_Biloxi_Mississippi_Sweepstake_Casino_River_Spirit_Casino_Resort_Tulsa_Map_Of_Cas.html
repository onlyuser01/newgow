    <h1>Hard Rock Casino In Biloxi Mississippi Sweepstake Casino River Spirit Casino Resort Tulsa Map Of Cas</h1>

<p>Hey Tomas thanks for your help I appreciate very much! Look Im an easy going guy and very reasonable if this is the time frame it really takes them to process a Bitcoin withdrawal then they need to put that in bold all over there website and marketing materials they use to lure in players.. I attached screenshots showing they don’t only claim "Instant Cash Outs" up to $2000 but they even go as far as to guarantee they have fastest pay outs online. For this reason alone I gave them a shot I thought they got to be fast to have something as bold as "guaranteed to be fastest online casino for cash outs". It’s a prime example of the old bait and switch I mean it doesn’t seem far fetched to thing they could do instant I deposit to them instantly with same Bitcoin method and it never takes longer than 5-10 minutes so again I saw an email they sent me and thought I’d give them a try. At this point it’s principle they didnt just mislead me they flat out lied to get my business and then slow pay you in the rare event ya win and try to cash out. Anyway thanks again if you need anything from me let me know! I’m gonna post this experience across every platform and forum I can until that money hits my account hopefully I will cost them a lot more than the $1k they are dragging there feet to pay out!</p>
