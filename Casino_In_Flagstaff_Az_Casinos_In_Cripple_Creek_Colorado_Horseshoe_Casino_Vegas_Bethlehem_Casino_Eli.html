    <h1>Casino In Flagstaff Az Casinos In Cripple Creek Colorado Horseshoe Casino Vegas Bethlehem Casino Eli</h1>

<p>Dear koniecznynathan23,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-players:</p>
<p>"Payments</p>
<p>For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing or withdrawing funds using a joint card or this possibility is communicated beforehand. Technically it is very difficult to check who’s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked often only during account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested. Therefore, it is a player’s responsibility to use allowed payment methods only.</p>
<p>Also, if you are not the legitimate owner of the casino account, we won't be able to help.</p>
<p>Could you please explain if your original account had any balance before it was banned by the casino?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
