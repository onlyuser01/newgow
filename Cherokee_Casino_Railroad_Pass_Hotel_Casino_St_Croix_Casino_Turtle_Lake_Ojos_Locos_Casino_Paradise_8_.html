    <h1>Cherokee Casino Railroad Pass Hotel Casino St Croix Casino Turtle Lake Ojos Locos Casino Paradise 8</h1>

<p>South Africa continues to be one of the hottest venues for iGaming on the African continent – a reputation that has now been reaffirmed through a partnership between Pariplay, a NeoGames S.A. subsidiary, and SunBet, a prominent local gaming operator.</p>
<p>This alliance will see Pariplay deploy a range of its titles with SunBet and strengthen the operator’s local content library, offering, and the experiences available to players. The collaboration will allow SunBet to provide its player bases with varied content that includes titles from Pariplay’s proprietary Wizard Games studio as well as third-party titles injected through the Fusion aggregation platform.</p>
<p>NeoGames President Tsachi Maimon hailed the opportunity to be working with SunBet, which he described as one of the best-known casino brands in Africa, and a company that offers an exceptional experience to its clients both across the land-based and online casino markets.</p>
<p>"We’re delighted to partner with them to bring not only Fusion aggregation content but also home-grown Wizard Games products to further elevate their players’ array of choice on an interesting and fast-growing regulated market," Maimon added.</p>
<p>He was joined by SunBet’s own CEO, Simon Gregory, who said that Pariplay was a market-leading player in the iGaming content space, thanks to both its own proprietary content and the powerful aggregation platform that features thousands of possible choices for SunBet and its players.</p>
<p>Gregory praised Pariplay’s ability to bring localized games and world-class titles to the shopping windows of its partners, and said his company was excited to be a part of this network. Pariplay presently has more than 14,000 games on its platform provided by 120 suppliers. The company further provides a number of excellent tools designed to increase the life value of a customer.</p>
<p>Popular retention tools that have made it easier for Pariplay partners to get maximum value include Raffle Rocket, Fusion Tournaments, and not least – Spin that Wheel, all of which are original features developed by the company.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been actively looking to expand its offer across the world, with the company working to actively increase its footprint in North and South America, Europe, and elsewhere. Recently, the company added EQL Games, a supplier and studio, to its Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Pariplay also strengthened its presence in Canada through a deal with Ainsworth Interactive, another respected developer of content for the iGaming industry.</p>
