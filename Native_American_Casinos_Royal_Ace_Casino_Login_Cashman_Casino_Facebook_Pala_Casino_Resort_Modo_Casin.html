<p>B2B iGaming software provider company EveryMatrix has added seasoned finance veteran Mark McMillan to its board of directors. In his position with the company, McMillan will help with the pending plans for expansion in the US.</p>
<p>McMillan Will Bring Two Decades of Experience to the Company</p>
<p>McMillan is a graduate of the University of Birmingham, where he studied Economics. He is also a chartered accountant. His skills, knowledge and expertise will be important assets for the future operations of EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>The new EveryMatrix board of directors member boasts of 20 years in the industry, working in the field of finance and strategy. He has worked for the London-based gambling operator William Hill since 2011. In 2016, McMillan rose to the position of chief financial officer. Since then, he has led some of the company’s acquisition deals across the United Kingdom, the US, Spain and Australia.</p>
<p>Prior to joining William Hill, McMillan worked for HSBC Global Banking and London-headquartered multinational professional services network Ernst &amp; Young Global Limited.</p>
<p>McMillan is glad to be joining the board of directors in EveryMatrix. He vowed to work together with the other board members in order to “assist the founders and the leadership team in developing and growing the company’s reach in the iGaming sector.”</p>
<p>McMillan noted that EveryMatrix’s growth in the past few years has been nothing short of remarkable and is willing to help it continue moving forward.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Envisions Further Expansion With a US Focus</p>
<p>The co-founder and chief executive officer of EveryMatrix, Ebbe Groes, also spoke on the matter. He welcomed McMillan to the company, saying that it is “a great pleasure” to have him as a member of the board of directors.</p>
<p>Groes confirmed that EveryMatrix has seen tremendous growth over the recent years. This is exactly why the company is making a shift towards becoming a “larger and more mature organization.” A part of achieving this is expanding the company’s team and reach.</p>
<p>Groes noted that the US market will be of huge importance to EveryMatrix’s growth and that’s exactly why it is so crucial to expanding the team and operations there.</p>
<p>True to its word, the company remains dedicated to expanding its team. At the beginning of October, it appointed Ashley Bloor as the owner of its remote gaming server. Then, around the end of the month, it hired Alina Alexandru in the position of chief technology officer.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix recently launched its managed services unit that aims to provide all-around support to its B2B clients.</p>
