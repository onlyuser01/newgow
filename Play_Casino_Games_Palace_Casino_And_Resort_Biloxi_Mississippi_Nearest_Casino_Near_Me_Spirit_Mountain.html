<p>Malta-headquarter Altenar has announced that it is hiring Antonino Barra to be the company’s new head of sales. Altenar is a company that specializes in the delivery of sportsbook solutions and that has quickly gained global prominence. This comes shortly after the company launched its sportsbook in Peru with Apuesta Total. Barra will work on the company’s northern European expansion over the coming weeks, and he will similarly focus on emerging markets.</p>
<p>Altenar Brings Well-Seasoned Veteran to Steer Growth</p>
<p>His experience will allow him to help the company spearhead growth in crucial markets. He also brings a wealth of experience and served in various executive roles across the industry. He worked at Together Gaming as the company’s CCO and Key Account Manager and has been crucial in helping drive growth, boost performance, and develop mobile channels.</p>
<p>Barra similarly worked as COO and Partner at Eligence Consulting Group, another Malta-based company. His new role will see him focused on helping Altenar deploy its sportsbook solution with new stakeholders and help penetrate new markets, and establish itself as the leading option for the market. Altenar spokesperson welcomed this appointment and said that the new head of sales was a much-anticipated development for the company:</p>
<p>Utilizing his years of experience in the iGaming industry, Antonino is sure to prove vital in developing effective growth strategies for us to implement over the coming years. Altenar has built up a lot of momentum in recent months, and the addition of Antonino will only serve to accelerate that. Altenar spokesperson</p>
<p>Barra himself said that he was really happy to be joining one of the leading companies in the sector. He assured that he will leverage his expertise to ensure that his knowledge serves Altenar well in helping the company pursue and achieve its long-term objectives. “Altenar has a fantastic future ahead and I’m looking forward to getting to work,” Barra concluded.</p>
<p>Altenar recently introduced its cash and out sportsbook feature for the Italian market as the company seeks to grow its presence in the country despite the strict local gambling laws. Altenar remains a leading sportsbook that is seeking to consolidate its footprint in existing markets and break ground in new ones. With Barra’s help, this ambitious goal will be once again available.</p>
