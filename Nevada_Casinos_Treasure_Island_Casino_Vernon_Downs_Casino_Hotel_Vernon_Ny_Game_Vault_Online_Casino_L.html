<p>The company anticipates further investment into its partner program, allowing top-performing products to reach new customers across the world</p>
<p>The global provider of content, technology and games for government-sponsored lottery operators, Scientific Games (SG), confirmed its plans to accelerate investment in its iLottery Content Hub, as well as partner program, targeting further growth and expansion. On Tuesday, the company confirmed it will showcase new digital games along with its partner program at the North American Association of State &amp; Provincial Lotteries 2023 Conference.</p>
<p>The prestigious event is taking place between October 30, 2023, and November 2, 2023. Additionally, SG reiterated its dedication to continue growing its portfolio of partners. The company said that it is joining forces with more than 15 games studios around the globe for the SG Content Hub, propelling the number of its iLottery games.</p>
<p>Games that visitors of the Conference can expect include SG Studios’ 3D progressive jackpot game inspired by Monopoly, the globally-recognized game, MONOPOLY Property Payout. Moreover, the company said that it will debut GAME OF THRONES, a new iLottery game announced earlier this summer and one that is expected to become a smashing hit.</p>
<p>Besides expanding its SG Content Hub, SG said that it plans to expand its partner program. Operators who join the program would be able to benefit from unique opportunities for the development of new iLottery game experiences through the company’s long list of more than 100 licensed brands.</p>
<p>Currently, the SG Content Hub and partner program represents a unique fusion of engaging lottery content aggregation and content partnerships with some of the best lottery-focused game developers across the globe. This initiative underlines the company’s dedication to growing its footprint while delivering best-in-class lottery-focused games to a wide range of operators.</p>
<p>The Company Remains Focused On Growing</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after early last month, SG strengthened its team by hiring Angela Goodwin. Joining the leading company, she brings more than 16 years of experience. Goodwin was appointed to the role of vice president of operations, spearheading the efforts of SG’s instant game management platform.</p>
<p>“We are seeking partner studios that offer unique, high-quality, lottery-focused game mechanics that will complement our own studio portfolio to join our SG Content Hub partner program.“ Steve Hickson, VP of digital games at Scientific Games</p>
<p>Steve Hickson, VP of digital games for Scientific Games, praised the efforts of SG Studios, explaining that it has more than 50 experienced team members that develop top-performing iLottery games. “Our roadmap plans are growing, and we will add games from a total of 20 partner studios accessible through the SG Content Hub by the end of 2024,” he added.</p>
<p>Speaking about the company’s growing list of partners, Hickson said that they are renowned across the globe for the quality of their content. Finally, he said that SG remains committed to delivering games that offer unique mechanics, design and engaging features, to new and existing lottery customers.</p>
