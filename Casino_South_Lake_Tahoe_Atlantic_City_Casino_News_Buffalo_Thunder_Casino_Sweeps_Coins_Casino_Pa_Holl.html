    <h1>Casino South Lake Tahoe Atlantic City Casino News Buffalo Thunder Casino Sweeps Coins Casino Pa Holl</h1>

<p>BETBY, an innovative supplier and provider of sportsbook content, has teamed up with 500 Casino to launch its full-scale sportsbook collection of games, Betby.Games. As a result, 500 Casino will have access to BETBY’s managed sportsbook solution, which also features a customizable product and a comprehensive reporting tool, support, and other features that will make the experience worthwhile to both 500 Casino and its customers.</p>
<p>BETBY and 500 Casino to Bring Players Value</p>
<p>Betby.Games will also provide 500 Casino with a range of esports titles that are based on artificial intelligence technology. Players at 500 Casino will have round-the-clock access to some of the most prominent competitive video games, giving the brand yet another vertical it can engage its players in.</p>
<p>BETBY has been expanding rapidly across the board, having recently launched a string of commercial partnerships, to wit STATSCORE, Together Gaming, and BC.GAME. BETBY Head of Sales Rosaire Galea Cavallaro welcomed this new opportunity to work with 500 Casino and said that BETBY was fully-committed to embracing innovative techs such as esports and blockchain. Cavallaro added:</p>
<p>We expect the business to benefit considerably from our customizable sportsbook solution and are delighted to add the operator to our growing partnership network. BETBY Head of Sales Rosaire Galea Cavallaro</p>
<p>500 Casino COO Cristoffer Andersson was similarly thrilled with the deal and said that the company was very much interested in BETBY’s interesting solutions and products. “We expect the supplier’s pioneering esports portfolio to go down well with our demanding player base, and eagerly anticipate the launch of fresh products in the collection,” Andersson said, offering prizes to BETBY’s solutions.</p>
<p>BETBY Builds Its Commercial Range of Partnerships</p>
<p>Previously, BETBY and STATSCORE teamed up to empower bettors and bring consumers the best possible read of odds and fixtures. STATSCORE incorporated its CupCenter widget, along with other technological advancements, into BETBY’s core offer. BETBY also launched its sportsbook offer with another partner in November, casino operator Roobet.</p>
<p>To better focus on esports, BETBY also finalized the separation of its esports solution that is fully designed to expand in the competitive video gaming vertical and can now do it separately as an independent unit of the BETBY family.</p>
