<p>The leading multimedia, technology, data and solutions provider for the sports and gaming industries, SportsGrid Network, announced new sports betting coverage agreement with The Associated Press (AP). Announcing the new collaboration on Tuesday, content from SportsGrid became available via AP Video Hub, as well as its Newsroom platforms.</p>
<p>SportsGrid Launches Its Content for AP Video Platforms</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent sports betting coverage deal, AP customers can now access SportsGrid content including pre-game odds, over/under, moneylines, point spread, as well as advanced data analytics. This, in turn, will help advertisers engage with a wider audience, while at the same time expanding the reach of SportsGrid’s leading content. According to SportsGrid, the terms of the new solution see its content serve “as the sports betting solution to integrate publishers, sportsbooks, and the massive sports gaming audience unlocking an entirely incremental revenue stream.”</p>
<p>“Content is available today on the AP Video Hub and Newsroom platforms, which provide online delivery of broadcast-quality video to the world’s leading digital publishers, news portals, and broadcasters,“ reads a statement released by SportsGrid</p>
<p>Currently, SportsGrid’s innovative video content features the best-in-class fantasy sports and sports betting coverage. Besides video content, the company offers daily sports news in real-time, analytics, data and statistical details that sports fans can access with ease from different devices. The company covers multiple high-profile leagues such as the NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB, offering news, statistics, daily odds and lines. What’s more, SportsGrid’s coverage includes soccer, golf, tennis and college sports. By offering a diverse portfolio of content, SportsGrid uncovers new opportunities for sponsorships with publishers and advertisers.</p>
<p>The Company Continuously Grows Its Presence</p>
<p>Late last month, SportsGrid unveiled a similar collaboration with Sportradar. Under the terms of the deal, SportsGrid Technology Solutions agreed to provide its comprehensive SportsGrid video and editorial content to Sportradar. As a result of the collaboration, Sportradar tapped into leading sports data and analytics provided by SportsGrid, allowing it to further increase the value for its partners. Earlier this year, in August, SportsGrid and BetMGM extended and expanded their strategic partnership.</p>
