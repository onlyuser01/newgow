<p>Playson, the creator of cutting-edge physical and online casino games, has recently struck a deal with the famous iGaming operator Royal Panda. This way Playson will land its suite of slots to the online casino.</p>
<p>For its part, Royal Panda will have access to Playson’s hit series Timeless Fruit Slots as well as to some of the newest products including Solar Queen, Clover Riches, and Vikings Fortune: Hold and Win.</p>
<p>The Story Behind Playson and Panda</p>
<p>Playson has created more than 60 online casino games so far, esatblishing itself as one of the leading developers and suppliers of content in iGaming business.</p>
<p>The company has offices in different countries and holds licenses from various gambling commissions and regulators, such as the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), Romania’s National Gambling Office (ONJN) and the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA).</p>
<p>Our slots are now live on Royal Panda!</p>

<p>Royal Panda, on the other hand, was founded only in 2014 but quickly took a leading place in the extremely competitive sphere of iGaming. The company which was acquired by LeoVegas Group, the parent company of LeoVegas, operates in some of Europe’s biggest regulated markets.</p>
<p>That is possible due to the fact it has been licensed by both the Malta Gaming Authority and the UKGC. According to Playson Sales Director Blanka Homor:</p>
<p>“We are always striving to further the reach of our games, and we are confident this new agreement will help us do that. It’s another fantastic step in strengthening our brand with the best operators, as well as further progression in our aim to be one of Europe’s leading suppliers,” she said about the integration with Royal Panda.</p>
<p>A Series Of Deals Marks Playson’s Success</p>
<p>The integration with Royal Panda is the latest result of a series of deals made by Playson in the past few months. Earlier this year, the supplier rolled out its content with Royal Panda’s sister brand LeoVegas. LeoVegas agreed to buy Royal Panda in October 2017.</p>
<p>Melvin Ritsema, Managing Director at Royal Panda, also commented on the deal. She said Playson was a well-respected name in the industry and its games would surely complement the existing offering.</p>
<p>She also added that she knew that their players would enjoy the company’s latest titles and, similarly to them, would look forward to seeing what else they could have in store in the months to come.</p>
<p>In fact, earlier this year in July, Playson became a partner of the Italian company Betflag. This step aimed to help the company extend its success in Italy’s thriving gambling market as well.</p>
<p>In the autumn, Playson launched live with Kindred Group, targeting Estonia and Finland with Ninja Casino. They didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>Playson stated they had received full certification for operating in Sweden. This way the company is going to be able to expand across the Swedish gambling market that was legalized on Janury 1, 2019.</p>
