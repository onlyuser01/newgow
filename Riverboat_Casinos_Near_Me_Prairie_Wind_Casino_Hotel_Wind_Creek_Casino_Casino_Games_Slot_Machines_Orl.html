    <h1>Riverboat Casinos Near Me Prairie Wind Casino Hotel Wind Creek Casino Casino Games Slot Machines Orl</h1>

<p>Good afternoon, before entering a casino and using my money, I like to verify my accounts. I've run into a problem with this casino where they will not pay me $200. Every time I try to withdraw money, some other issue arises. They've already verified my account, cards, and address, yet I keep facing new hurdles. I've given them everything they've asked for and have spent so much time dealing with their requirements. My frustration isn't so much about the $200, as I have indeed deposited a lot more in a day, but rather about the unfairness of their tactics. I usually use btc but recently started to use my bank card for withdrawals. They don't ask for much information: you simply provide the card number, security code, and expiration date, then they charge you. That isn't the problem. They charge without verifying if the card is your own. The problem arises when I attempt to make withdrawals. They then ask for a full photograph of the card which isn't an issue for me. My card is a debit card, not a credit card, and therefore doesn't come with billing statements. I explained this to them and they accepted all my documentation. Yet, they insist on a billing statement of my debit card, which I can't provide since debit cards don't come with statements in the first place. I submitted my online banking information and they didn't accept it. I sent them a photograph of my savings ledger that illustrates my name, account number, and banking transactions, as banks in El Salvador still use savings ledgers. However, despite having completed all their requirements, they still refuse me withdrawals.</p>
<p>Earlier, even after they had approved my card, they kept rejecting all my address receipts. I submitted several ones and finally, after numerous attempts, they approved my address. Now, they are backtracking and asking to verify my card, which they have already done, and they have even made charges to it already. I'll highlight where it states that everything has been approved. Honestly, I didn't experience such issues when I played at rockeplay. I feel utterly frustrated.</p>
