<p>The 110th annual Rose Bowl is on the program on January 1, 2024, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California</p>
<p>The Alabama Crimson Tide are 12-1 and are ranked fifth in the nation. Coached by legendary HC Nick Saban, the Tide are hoping to cash in on their good form which saw them win 11 games in a row.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for ‘Bama’s fans, their opponents in the 2024 Rose Bowl have been even more impressive – the Michigan Wolverines have won every single game in more than a year.</p>

<p>Crimson Tide Is Back in the CFP After One-Year Hiatus</p>
<p>The Alabama Crimson Tide defeated the Georgia Bulldogs in the 2023 SEC Championship Game, ahead of which the Bulldogs were the No. 1 ranked college football team in the nation. Georgia entered the game as a six-point favorite, but Alabama ended up winning by three points.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to January 1 and the Crimson Tide are taking on the new No. 1 NCAAF team. Can they stage another upset? The 2024 Rose Bowl odds aren’t in their favor, but their confidence seems to be high.</p>
<p>All of their key men are in top shape, most notably, their quarterback Jalen Milroe, who’s turning into a real superstar of college football. He’s one of the best NCAAF QBs, but is he good enough to outsmart the nation’s best defense?</p>
<p>Wolverines to Prove They’re the Best</p>
<p>The Michigan Wolverines are the highest-ranked team in college football at the moment. They went 13-0 in the regular season, beating a couple of ranked teams along the way.</p>
<p>In their most recent game – the 2023 Big Ten Championship Game – the Wolverines beat the #20 Iowa Hawkeyes 26-0. Before that, they beat the #7 Ohio State Buckeyes 30-24.</p>
<p>The Wolverines are the nation’s 12th-best offense in the league with a PPG of 36.7. Their quarterback JJ McCarthy has been sensational, especially in big games. Still, Michigan’s strongest weapon this season has been its defensive team.</p>
<p>With just 9.5 points conceded per game, the Wolverines are the best defense in the 2023-24 college football season.</p>
<p>Alabama Crimson Tide vs. Michigan Wolverines 2024 Rose Bowl</p>
<p>Alabama’s offense is great, but even Milroe &amp; Co. cannot do much against Michigan’s defense. The Wolverines haven’t conceded more than 30 points in more than a year, and we doubt the Crimson Tide will change that.</p>
<p>Instead, we think Michigan will keep them to just a touchdown or two. But what about the other way around? We think the Wolverines’ offensive team will do a fine job on January 1. As a result, Jim Harbaugh’s men should win the 2024 Rose Bowl, covering the spread along the way.</p>
<p>Pick: Michigan Wolverines -1.5</p>
