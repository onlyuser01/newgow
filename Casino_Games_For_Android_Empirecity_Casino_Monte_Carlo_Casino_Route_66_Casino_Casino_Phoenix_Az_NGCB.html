<p>Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Thursday that the chairwoman of the gaming regulatory body in the state, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), will be stepping down from the position due to accepting an offer from the private sector. Sandra Douglas Morgan’s resignation will be effective November 6 according to official information from the governor’s office.</p>
<p>Gov. Sisolak appointed Sandra Douglas Morgan as chairman of the NGCB in January 2019 for a 4-year term, to replace Becky Harris, following her experience from the Nevada Gaming Commission (NGC), as she was brought as a member of the commission by then-Gov. Brian Sandoval in 2018.</p>
<p>Steady Hand and Unmatched Leadership</p>
<p>In a statement released from the governor’s office, Gov. Sisolak expressed his gratitude to chairwoman Morgan, noting her significant contribution for the gaming industry during a period of uncertainty.</p>
<p>“I will forever be grateful to Chairwoman Douglass Morgan for her hard work and dedication to the State. She has been with the administration from the start, and her steady hand and unmatched leadership has been critical in guiding Nevada’s gaming industry through one of the most turbulent periods in its history.” Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak</p>
<p>Chaired by Morgan, the NGCB had to face the unprecedented situation with the outbreak of the coronavirus and to oversee the casinos’ response to it, as well as a large scale corporate combination within the industry, the $17.3 billion merger deal between Caesars Entertainment and Eldorado Resorts.</p>
<p>Sandra Douglas Morgan, who also served as a director of external affairs at AT&amp;T in southern Nevada, a city attorney in North Las Vegas as well as a litigation attorney at MGM Resorts, cut short on the 4-year term as chairwoman of the NGCB as she accepted an offer to join the board of directors at Fidelity National Financial.</p>
<p>Honor of a Lifetime</p>
<p>Chairwoman Morgan also issued a statement, to explain that she would be leaving to pursue further professional opportunities.</p>
<p>“It has been a privilege to lead the Nevada Gaming Control Board with such a rich and proficient history in gaming regulation. Working with an outstanding and dedicated staff throughout the state has been the honor of a lifetime.” NGCB Chairwoman Sandra Douglas Morgan</p>
<p>The provider of title insurance and settlement services to the real estate and mortgage industries, Fidelity National Financial, confirmed Friday that Morgan would be joining the board of directors effective November 9.</p>
<p>According to information from the governor’s office, Gov. Sisolak will announce a new chairperson for the state’s gaming regulator in the near future.</p>
