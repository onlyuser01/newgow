<p>Hello De Luca.</p>
<p>I want to ask which games did you play? All depends on variance (volatility)</p>
<p>Variance (volatility) of games of chance:</p>
<p>To put it simply, the variance (also known as volatility) of a game determines how rapidly your bankroll is changing when you play the game:</p>
<p>When playing a game with low variance , you win small winnings quite often. In this case, your bankroll changes quite evenly, although, unfortunately, usually downwards.</p>
<p>, you win small winnings quite often. In this case, your bankroll changes quite evenly, although, unfortunately, usually downwards. In the case of a high-variance game, you lose in a vast majority of rounds, but when you win, you win high. Gradual drop-downs are, from time to time, replaced by a big gain.</p>

<p>In some games, you can win a small amount of money every second/third round and some games you are only losing and then suddenly you can become wealthy.</p>
<p>In your case, the game history would be beneficial, or at least a better description of your problem.</p>
