<p>Belal Muhammad Struggling to Make Weight for UFC 288</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, Belal Muhammad had no idea he was going to fight at UFC 288. Originally, the co-main event was supposed to be the fight between Charles Oliveira and Beneil Dariush, but that one got scrapped. Muhammad stepped in on short notice to save the day, but there’s a big question of whether he’s had enough time to prepare.</p>
<p>The thing is that according to his nutritionist, Muhammad is almost 20 pounds above the weight limit for the welterweight division. In fact, the nutritionist first said it was 40 pounds, but later changed his statement.</p>
<p>In either case, Muhammad’s body is bound to suffer during the weight-cutting process, which comes only days after he ended his Ramadan fasting (Mar 22 – Apr 20). For a whole month, he ate no food and drank no water from dawn until dusk.</p>
<p>Gilbert Burns Is Always Up for a Fight</p>
<p>Gilbert Burns lives and breathes fighting, as evident from the fact that he wholeheartedly accepted the UFC 288 fight even though he fought Masvidal just 28 days before. He won the Masvidal fight by unanimous decision after three fights of intense fighting.</p>
<p>Intense fighting is actually his style. This guy likes to throw everything at his opponents, even if it meant risking an early defeat. However, so far, it’s worked for him – he’s lost only two fights inside the distance.</p>
<p>The last time it happened was when Kamaru Usman knocked him out in the fight for the UFC Welterweight title in February 2021.</p>
<p>Belal Muhammad vs Gilbert Burns Prediction</p>
<p>This fight is so difficult to predict. Whatever happens on Saturday, no one’s gonna be surprised. That said, we do think that Burns is going to win, probably by decision.</p>
<p>Pick: Gilbert Burns to win by decision</p>
