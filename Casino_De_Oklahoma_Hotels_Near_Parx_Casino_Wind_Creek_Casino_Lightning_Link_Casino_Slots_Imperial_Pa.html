    <h1>Casino De Oklahoma Hotels Near Parx Casino Wind Creek Casino Lightning Link Casino Slots Imperial Pa</h1>

<p>Update: Today is October 20th</p>
<p>On October 10th I applied for €4500 to be paid out.</p>
<p>I canceled and lost €300.</p>
<p>Last week it was 1x400, 2 days later it was 400€ again and after the weekend this week I received 200€, a total of 1000€ received.</p>
<p>It's been 10 days since the application!!</p>
<p>I had a huge fanfare and endless dialogues with the chat.</p>
<p>You are always assured that you should wait and you won't be cheated.</p>
<p>Today is October 20th and this morning, even though the processing is supposedly already with the external provider, they simply canceled €800 (2 TRANSACTION ID s) and put it back on the balance to play with 👁️🧠🧠🧠😡😡😡I'm stinking angry. They keep saying, don't worry, with this amount a maximum of 5 working days, then the money will be available again with a 5-day waiting period from some external provider.</p>
<p>I accepted that too and waited!!!</p>
<p>My Mastercard was fine, it always went to this card.</p>
<p>Now they say technical problems again, and it's not our fault.</p>
<p>10 days have passed today.</p>
<p>€2000 is still missing.</p>
<p>The €800 that they simply, I call it strategically, credited back to my balance today, without any plausible and legitimate reason, has been available for payment for 8 working days, and they simply credit it back.</p>
<p>With this drama I have completely lost my trust in the payout policy of this casino.</p>
<p>Why are you doing this to your loyal customers?</p>
<p>I still get €2000.</p>
<p>Today is 8 working days!!!</p>
<p>You simply post money back to the balance that has been in the payout for 8 working days😡😡😡</p>
<p>Then you wait for help in the chat, help seems to be there, an employee seems to be trying hard.</p>
<p>After waiting for 25 mins, please wait, I will check. Does he actually say that he is sorry that I got into such a situation and that the payout can sometimes take longer than the maximum stipulated in the terms and conditions. 😡😡😡😱 Oh yeah 😂😂😂😂</p>
<p>Boy, I'm not here just before a hundred, no, completely different numbers. DAMNED</p>
<p>I want everyone here to know how sophisticated the process is here😰</p>
<p>I just want to finally have my €2000.</p>
<p>It's so damn disappointing.</p>
<p>I will report on Monday!!!</p>
<p>Every detail, I promise, ICECASINO</p>
<p>I wanted to advertise for you, I was so happy about my little win😰</p>
