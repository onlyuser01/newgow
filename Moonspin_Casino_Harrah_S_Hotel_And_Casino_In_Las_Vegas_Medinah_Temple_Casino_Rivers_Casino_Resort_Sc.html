<p>The leading AI and data science powerhouse, Future Anthem, announced it continues to grow its workforce and has seen an exponential increase in its workforce over the last year. The company revealed Monday that since its Series A raise, completed in July 2022, its workforce more than doubled. Future Anthem revealed that last year, its members were only 21. After just over a year, now, its team continues to grow and now has 43 members. Additionally, Future Anthem confirmed that it anticipates further growth and expansion of its workforce.</p>
<p>Currently, more than two-thirds of the company's team consists of data science, product, as well as engineering experts. Those employees represent the company's top talent and deliver strategic knowledge and skills that can help Future Anthem continue to grow and deliver unique experiences. At the same time, the company plans to continue the development of content and solutions that cater to the lottery, betting and casino sector, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Growing its workforce, Future Anthem hired interns that graduated from leading UK universities. This enabled the company to engage with top talent in AI and data science. By now, Future Anthem has seven full-time employees that have started their careers with the company as interns. This reaffirms its dedication to fostering talent and helping young people grow through career opportunities.</p>
<p>Staying true to diversity and inclusion, Future Anthem currently has a workforce that consists of 16 different nationalities. Such efforts create a multicultural work environment. What's more, the company's female-to-male gender ratio is 40% and 60%, which is better than the average ratio for the tech vertical. At the same time, Future Anthem remains committed to improving its KPIs related to diversity and growing its team even more.</p>
<p>Emma Ferguson, Future Anthem's Head of People, shared her excitement by saying: "We are proud to have assembled a team of experts who not only possess exceptional technical abilities but also deep insights into the specific dynamics of the sports betting and gaming industry."</p>
<p>Finally, she pointed out: "By harnessing the knowledge and expertise of our diverse workforce, we are well-positioned to develop AI products that address the evolving needs of our clients and drive transformative change within the industry."</p>
<p>Near the end of last month, Future Anthem confirmed it strengthened its team with the addition of Ann-Kathrin Baumgardt, an ex-IGT executive. Joining the company, she was appointed to the role of VP of Sales and Customer Development for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).</p>
