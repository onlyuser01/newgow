<p>T-Mobile Arena is where Canelo vs. Charlo will be held on Saturday, September 30, with a live stream available on Showtime PPV</p>
<p>Jermell Charlo is fighting his first super middleweight bout on September 30. Originally, he was supposed to defend his light-middleweight titles against Tim Tszyu but that match fell through. As a result, Charlo will move up a weight class to fight one of the greatest super-middleweight pugilists in history. This is why it‚Äôs no surprise bookies see Canelo as a -450 favorite.</p>

<p>Canelo Alvarez Fighting for His Legacy</p>
<p>Canelo Alvarez is the best middleweight in the world, it‚Äôs a fact! His professional boxing record is 59-2-2. One of the two bouts he lost was a light heavyweight championship bout with Dmitry Bivol in 2022. The other one happened against legendary Floyd Mayweather in 2013. It was a majority decision win for ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù which shows how close Canelo was to staying undefeated.</p>

<p>Since losing to Mayweather more than a decade ago, Canelo is undefeated in the middleweight (as well as light and super middleweight) division. In his most recent bout ‚Äì held in May this year ‚Äì he defeated John Ryder by unanimous decision after 12 rounds of boxing.</p>
<p>The last time he defeated someone by a knockout/technical knockout was two years ago when he beat Caleb Plant by TKO in round 11. Maybe it‚Äôs time for that to happen again?</p>
<p>Jermell Charlo Fighting the Biggest Bout of His Career</p>
<p>Jermell Charlo is an aggressive boxer with fast hands and great movement in the ring. This explains why more than half of his bouts finished in a KO/TKO win for him. He‚Äôs 35-1-1 overall, with his only loss happening by decision to Tony Harrison in 2018.</p>

<p>He also has one draw in his portfolio, which happened in July 2022 against Brian Castano. The two met again a year after the draw, and Charlo won by KO in the 10th round. A year and a half later, he‚Äôs boxing again. But this time, he‚Äôs facing the toughest challenge of his entire career.</p>
<p>Canelo vs. Charlo Prediction</p>
<p>Jermell Charlo is exactly the kind of opponent Canelo likes to fight. The Mexican boxing legend is a great counterpuncher, meaning that Charlo‚Äôs style is likely to suit him. But even if that wasn‚Äôt the case, Canelo would still be seen as a huge favorite. This way, not only is he likely to win, but he might do it by a KO/TKO.</p>
<p>Pick: Canelo Alvarez to win by KO/TKO.</p>
