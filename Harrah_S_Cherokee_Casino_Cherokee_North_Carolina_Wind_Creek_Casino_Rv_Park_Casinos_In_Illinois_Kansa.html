    <h1>Harrah S Cherokee Casino Cherokee North Carolina Wind Creek Casino Rv Park Casinos In Illinois Kansa</h1>

<p>Greetings from Peergame ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>We are hosting a special giveaway for the Casino Guru community!</p>
<p>All members of the community can participate in the giveaway.</p>
<p>How to participate</p>
<p>Reply your Money Button paymail address (ex: 413398@moneybutton.com) to this post. That's it!</p>
<p>If you don't already have your own Money Button wallet, here is a simple guide to creating one: https://peergame.com/wallet-guide/</p>
<p>If you don't know what Money Button is, it is one of the most used online Bitcoin SV wallets.</p>
<p>Peergame is powered by Bitcoin SV blockchain and all our games are ON-CHAIN, which allows our players to play straight from their private wallets. Simply log-in to your Money Button, and open Peergame.com in the same browser. Then you will be able to place bets from your Money Button wallet to our casino, hence playing from your own pocket! We use this system to give our players full control over their funds at ALL TIMES and FREE them from the hassles of deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>We currently only have Money Button integrated, but more BSV wallets will be integrated soon, so our players can have more options!</p>
<p>Prize</p>
<p>10 winners will be selected randomly, and will receive 0.01 Bitcoin SV each.</p>
<p>We will accept entries until October 29th, 2020 at 9 am(GMT).</p>
<p>Good luck to everyone!</p>
