<p>The company that specializes in hosting solutions for the gambling industry has had two new achievements to report on Monday, with Internet Vikings obtaining accreditations in two different states</p>
<p>In a press release shared by the company, Internet Vikings confirmed that it had been granted an Ancillary Supplier License in Arizona and a vendor registration in New York.</p>
<p>Internet Vikings Secures New Growth Opportunities in the US</p>
<p>This aligns with the company’s long-term goal to continue growing its footprint in the iGaming and sports betting markets in the United States at a time of rapid expansion of the legal framework.</p>
<p>Internet Vikings Founder and CEO Rickard Vikström has welcomed both achievements and said that Arizona and New York were pivotal for the firm and major accomplishments in the company’s overall strategy for growth in the United States. He added:</p>
<p>New York is the largest and highest-grossing sports betting market in North America, representing strategic importance for the industry. However, it was even more important to be able to bring our offering to Arizona where the number of sportsbooks keeps increasing fast. Internet Vikings Founder and CEO Rickard Vikström</p>
<p>Internet Vikings specialize in global iGaming hosting solutions and it has been working hard to meet the increasing demand for reliable and DDoS-protected hosting services. As such, the company is looking to grow its presence in key regulated states in the country and also establish the ground network that it would need to provide customers with the level of security they are after.</p>
<p>Internet Vikings Confident in Future of Its Services</p>
<p>Internet Vikings head of regulatory affairs Elena Kvakova said that the company completed the licensing process in Arizona without any delays or unexpected events. The company also teamed up with a local data center that holds a license to meet regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, Internet Vikings COO Kristoffer Ottosson said that the firm is fully prepared to now support clients and offer them the level of protection they need.</p>
<p>Ottosson spoke of Internet Vikings’ inherent reliability, scalability, and security of services and argued that the company was fully committed to providing potential and existing clients with dependable and robust hosting solutions to foster further growth and success and protect them from bad actors.</p>
<p>“We continuously leverage our infrastructure to guarantee reliability, scalability, and security of our services and are prepared to expand to meet the evolving needs of our customers,” he concluded. Internet Vikings has already been working with companies in the United States. The firm partnered with GAN to cover the latter’s offer in 15 markets in the United States alone.</p>
