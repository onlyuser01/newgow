    <h1>Pendleton Casino Casinos In Bahamas Casinos Ok Casino Livingston Casino El Camino FanDuel Now offici</h1>

<p>Following a new multi-year partnership between FanDuel and the PGA TOUR, FanDuel is now an official betting partner for the TOUR. Under the agreement, FanDuel will have the right to use logos and advertise within the TOUR media and its partner platforms.</p>
<p>A Multi-Year Partnership Signed by FanDuel and the PGA Tour</p>
<p>Monday, August 31, FanDuel teamed up with the PGA TOUR. Under the multi-year partnership, FanDuel became an official betting partner of the PGA TOUR. The deal will see FanDuel have the rights to use logos and also advertise within TOUR Media as well as TOUR partner platforms. Furthermore, FanDuel will now have the right to create pre and post-event betting programming and content.</p>
<p>Recently, the PGA Tour and the golf’s popularity skyrocketed. According to FanDuel, golf has seen a significant increase in popularity on the company’s platform in recent months since it resumed play after being interrupted by the pandemic. The company said that golf had: “the highest single-event handle on FanDuel Sportsbook on nine of the last 12 Sundays“.</p>
<p>In the last few months, we see that the PGA Tour signed a few similar partnerships. Back in July, the PGA TOUR signed a multi-year partnership with DraftKings. Under the partnership expansion, DraftKings became the first Official Betting Operator for the PGA Tour.</p>

<p>Mike Raffensperger, FanDuel Group Chief Marketing Officer shared his excitement by saying: “Golf interest is up on FanDuel, so we are excited to deepen our relationship with the PGA TOUR.” He continued by pointing out that FanDuel is now going to be able to offer a unique gaming experience on its platform. Raffensperger added that special TOUR promotions and content will be available for FanDuel’s clients.</p>
<p>But here is what the PGA Senior Vice President of Media &amp; Gaming, Norb Gambuzza said about the partnership: “We have long admired FanDuel’s brand, product and marketing strategies as well as the leadership position it has taken since the legalization of sports betting in 2018.” He shared that the company is excited to bring FanDuel into the PGA TOUR’s Official Betting Operator program. Gambuzza concluded by saying that the company will continue to engage new fans in the “rapidly growing space”.</p>
<p>Here, we cannot miss to say that the PGA Tour also signed a partnership with BetMGM last month. Similar to the current partnership, BetMGM received the rights to use PGA TOUR marks as well as advertise within TOUR media and TOUR partner platforms. Looking at the fast pace with which the PGA Tour is growing, we can honestly say that for them the sky is the limit.</p>
