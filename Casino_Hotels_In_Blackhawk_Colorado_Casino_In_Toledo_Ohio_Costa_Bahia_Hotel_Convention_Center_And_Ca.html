    <h1>Casino Hotels In Blackhawk Colorado Casino In Toledo Ohio Costa Bahia Hotel Convention Center And Ca</h1>

<p>Hi ,</p>
<p>thanks for replying, No it was Not like what you assume. On NOV.8Th I place a bet greet her than the table limit And the game automatically stopped cause the amount of bet was breather than the maximum limit and the system asked me to reload the game , which I did ,but every time I reload the game the system mistakenly deduced the bet which was placed from my balance.</p>
<p>then I reported to the casino snd they reimbursed it for me.</p>
<p>After that incidence I reviewed my previous transaction and found out that also on OCT and JUN " THE SAME SCENARIO HAS BEEN HAPPENED" and I have lost 175mBTC due to the same " ERROR " and fault with the game.</p>
<p>So , I contacted the casino and told them that the same thing has been happened and I just found it out , But they refused to reimbursement for the same fault and mistake.</p>
<p>this is the " Universal rule " of every single casino in the world that you CANNOT placed any wager more than table limit and that is why every tankful has special limit.</p>
<p>And when I put placed the bet more than the table limit the game and the system stopped me from playing and ask me to reload the game and adjust the bet but when I did that by the game deducted the bet which was placed from my balance.</p>
<p>below I attached again the hands details I also send you a screen shot from my transactions from casinoâ€™s website.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate if you can follow this matter and reimburse my funds , cause any bet placed more than table limit in any casino is Not allowed and should be refunded does Not matter the player win or lost.</p>
