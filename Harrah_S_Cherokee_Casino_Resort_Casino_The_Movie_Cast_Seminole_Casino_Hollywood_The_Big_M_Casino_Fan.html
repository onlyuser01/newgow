    <h1>Harrah S Cherokee Casino Resort Casino The Movie Cast Seminole Casino Hollywood The Big M Casino Fan</h1>

<p>Dear stakeholders,</p>
<p>In no way do I see this open case as solved. Casino Noricasino must be accountable for the actions of all employees of their company who communicate with customers/players in a recognizable manner.</p>
<p>As I have already pointed out, but probably overlooked by Nordicasino, I spoke to a chat agent while playing with the bonus. No 50 bets were made with active bonus balance. The bonus balance was fully cleared by fulfilling the wagering requirements! If this wasn't the case, the chat clerk gave the wrong answer when I asked if I had fulfilled the bonus. Because it is not clear to the player on the Nordicasino site whether they are playing with a bonus or real money. The balances are not shown separately. The false statement could not be given to the detriment of the player either. The casino has to pay out the winnings. It was played for several hours. If the casino had given an early notification that the bonus had not been fulfilled, I would hardly have wasted my time playing, since winnings would obviously not have been realizable.</p>
<p>It was therefore necessary for me to explicitly ask in the chat. "I would have fulfilled the bonus".</p>
<p>The casino should therefore immediately make the chat history accessible. This will have been saved by Nordicasino.</p>
<p>The diverse, legally erroneous view of the casino operator becomes very clear when he refers to his terms and conditions, which are obviously to be declared invalid in legal transactions. The casino is fraudulently pretending to offer me a refund of my deposit i. hv 50.00 euros. What actually happened was an unlawful removal of my legitimate winnings.</p>
<p>Withholding my deposit would clearly have constituted criminal fraud or embezzlement. My deposit was therefore undoubtedly MY MONEY and not the casino's money, since obviously no more profits could be made with the deposit. If I want to play for fun, I definitely don't use real money. Invoking general terms and conditions is only permissible if these are made available to the customer in simple, unambiguous language by the entrepreneur. The casino must comply with the legal requirements of the country in which it offers its offer. Therefore, German law applies exclusively with regard to the General Terms and Conditions. According to this, the terms and conditions clauses used should under no circumstances have any effect against the player and cannot entitle the company to an obvious criminal offense.</p>
<p>If it turns out that high stakes have actually been made with bonus credit, this could have been prevented very easily by technical precautions. Especially since the slot machines can be played very easily with high to very high stakes if you accidentally click. The whole procedure of the casino is questionable and one-sided almost fraudulently designed in favor of the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I therefore continue to demand an immediate payment of my long overdue winnings of around 4000.00 euros! The casino also wishes to be transparent in resolving this case and not invoke invalid, inapplicable or fraudulent and ambiguous terms and conditions.</p>
<p>When resolving this case, I would also give the operator of the Nordicasinos to consider that, after a rough examination, it probably should not have been active on the German gaming market at all if player protection, as in the present case, is trampled underfoot.</p>
<p>Should the casino continue to embezzle my winnings and not pay them out to me, I will be forced to sue for my full deposits of the last few years. Because whoever specifies a chance of winning must, in the event of a win, which is ultimately at the player's risk, stick to the promised chance of winning, and in particular may not refuse the winnings achieved against the programmed probability of the machines. So if Nordicasino does not grant my claim here, I will have to file a lawsuit promptly, and I would clearly win this according to the applicable case law. I would also report openly about this case here in order to protect other players from the obviously practiced fraud of the Nordic Casino. The Nordicasino can think this over carefully and now consider reasonably whether it would finally like to grant my claim and the repeated demand for my money.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Thomas</p>
