<p>A Comtrade representative said that SpinBit’s GGR started to increase immediately after it was migrated to Comtrade’s iCore platform</p>
<p>Comtrade Gaming, a leading iGaming platform provider, has announced a new tie-up with the dynamic online casino and sportsbook provider SpinBit. According to the former company, SpinBit’s existing operation was migrated over to Comtrade Gaming’s iCore platform in September. That month also saw SpinBit launch its sister brand SpinBet.</p>
<p>The migration of SpinBit to Comtrade Gaming’s iCore platform was overseen by a team of seasoned industry professionals who ensured that the procedure was smooth, seamless and highly professional.</p>
<p>Comtrade Gaming added that its iCore online gaming platform has the perfect capacities for strategic collaborations that require the management of omnichannel gaming and products. The solution streamlines omnichannel gaming, providing clients with a unified perspective of the activities of their players.</p>
<p>In addition, iCore automates bonuses, allowing gambling companies to improve the overall experience of their customers.</p>
<p>SpinBit’s GGR Increased Following the Migration</p>
<p>James Grant, SpinBit’s chief operating officer, explained that his team chose to migrate to Comtrade Gaming’s iCore platform because tailored software development can truly benefit its business. He noted that Comtrade Gaming’s approach to individual client attention gave his team a lot of confidence. SpinBit’s team was further reassured by the success of Comtrade’s other clients.</p>
<p>We prioritize innovation as the key to our very ambitious growth plans, we want to break the mold in how we market ourselves and streamline operations, Comtrade Gaming gives us the technical capability to support our strategy. James Grant, COO, SpinBit</p>
<p>Grant concluded that he is excited to roll out SpinBit’s products in additional markets.</p>
<p>Comtrade Gaming’s chief commercial officer, Steven Valentine, expressed his excitement about the announcement. He said that his team is proud to be working with top gaming companies and to be providing them with the tools and resources they need to hit their targets. Valentine also noted that his team is primarily focused on migrating live operators, which is why it sports a dedicated project team to ensure the success of such procedures.</p>
<p>The CCO pointed out that SpinBit’s GGR started to increase immediately after it was migrated to Comtrade’s iCore platform.</p>
<p>The SpinBit team is rewriting the marketing playbook when it comes to online operations and their attention to detail with player engagement is at the highest level. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with SpinBit, based on a mutual belief in focus for growth through attention to detail. Steven Valentin, CCO, Comtrade Gaming</p>
<p>In August Comtrade reached an agreement to distribute Livespins’ innovative social product.</p>
