    <h1>Pultz Casino Best Casinos In Biloxi Mississippi Casino Outfit Casinos Near Los Angeles Pocola Casino</h1>

<p>Hello, I took advantage of the free registration bonus at this casino. I managed to meet wagered and after that I reduced the money to $ 10, because that is the maximum win from this promotion.</p>
<p>I verified my account fully, I sent photos of ID card + selfie and driving license photos, I also verified the phone number and passed additional verification via the telegram application and what's up .... then I was ordered to make a deposit ... so I made a deposit using Payeer, support wrote that a minimum deposit is enough to unlock the payment channel.</p>
<p>2 days passed and unfortunately I did not receive the withdrawal despite the fact that all the documents were accepted and I was informed in advance that all I had to do now was wait for the withdrawal. Unfortunately, after 2 days I got an answer that to make my withdrawal a next deposit should be made .... and it must be a credit card deposit ... I don't use bank accounts, but I created an account and wanted to make this deposit but ... I don't know why my bank will decline the payment ... maybe it is because of the anti-hazard law introduced in my country? ...</p>
<p>However, the casino has not withdrawn my $ 10 win for 2 months ... it is strange to me and I suspect that the casino can be a scam. because despite the fact that I passed the verification positively and made a minimum Payeer deposit (Payeer account to make a transaction I also need to have verified and I have verified) they did not complete the withdrawal ... They further claim that I have to make another deposit by credit card ... and this is not possible because my the bank declines this transaction ... please help</p>
