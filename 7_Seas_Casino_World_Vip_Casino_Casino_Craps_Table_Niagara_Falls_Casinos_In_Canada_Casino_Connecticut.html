<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I found this:</p>
<p>"5.6. Spin Palace is a member of the Group. You may not claim a Bonus if (1) prior to opening an Account, you have opened an Account at any other website within the Group and claimed such a Bonus from such other website and (2) having claimed such Bonus from the other websites within the Group, wagered such previously claimed Bonus and initial deposit less than 100 times at the online casino granting you such Bonus. Under no circumstances shall you be eligible for more than one sign- up bonus even if you are able to open multiple Accounts thereat (in, for example, different currencies or languages). If your Account has been credited with a sign- up bonus for which you (in our sole and unfettered discretion) are ineligible, we shall retrospectively void such sign- up bonus and any winnings received by you after the sign- up bonus has been credited to your relevant Accounts."</p>
<p>I feel like the issue could be following: You used bonuses (1st deposit etc.) on your old account that you mentioned and then you opened a new account where you claimed a bonus as well. In that case, they say that</p>
<p>"We shall retrospectively void such sign- up bonus and any winnings received by you after the sign- up bonus has been credited..."</p>
<p>That could be the reason why your 2nd account was closed. I suggest you to wait for few more days until the casino tells you why the account is closed, even though 48hrs already passed.</p>
