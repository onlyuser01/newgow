<p>GamCare has announced it will provide customized support to those negatively affected by gambling in Leeds and the East Midlands</p>
<p>People who have been directly or indirectly affected by problem gambling will be eligible for the independent charity’s Money Guidance Service. This means that they will benefit from the aid needed to get back on track with the help of the new support program.</p>
<p>Support Via the National Gambling Helpline Is Open 24/7</p>
<p>GamCare’s new service is an excellent release in the context of the ongoing cost-of-living crisis that has been affecting households in the two named areas. The organization will operate the National Gambling Helpline as part of the new service. The helpline will remain open on a 24-hour basis, seven days a week, providing people with practical advice, tips, information, and additional support regarding gambling free of charge.</p>
<p>Additionally, Leeds and East Midlands individuals looking for more guidance can benefit from one-to-one support sessions completed with the help of the Leeds Community Gambling Service which offers free and fully confidential face-to-face, phone, and online support.</p>
<p>Similar support sessions will be provided in the East Midlands, thanks to the dedicated GamCare East Midlands crew that is ready to offer the entire array of free and flexible services for anyone who has been financially affected by gambling problems. The services will be easily accessible for people living in Nottingham, Lincolnshire, Derby, Peterborough, Northampton, and Leicester.</p>
<p>What Will the Money Guidance Service Teach?</p>
<p>Anyone reaching out for help via the Money Guidance Service will receive money guidance meant to help them more easily comprehend their spending habits, manage their spending budgets, or recognize what are their spending triggers. At the same time, they will learn how to set the necessary boundaries and receive advice regarding additional lifestyle changes that could help them regain their financial balance.</p>
<p>The guidance service will also provide information on how people affected by their loved ones’ gambling habits can extract their finances from the gambler whenever needed. They will also be taught how to understand their own rights when involved in a relationship with a gambler and how to access the support that is available to them.</p>
<p>One in Seven People Called the National Gambling Helpline in 2022</p>
<p>GamCare’s service manager for East Midlands, Nicola O’Neill, explained that one in seven people felt the need to contact the National Gambling Helpline in 2022 because of someone else’s gambling. O’Neill this way justified the need for the new services, further commenting “it’s important that there are services available to support others who are affected”. He went further to explain that it is imperative to understand the financial implications of other people’s gambling for long-term recovery.</p>
<p>According to a YouGov survey issued last year and commissioned by GamCare, 44% of Yorkshire and the Humber areas expressed their worry regarding their financial situation. At the same time, more than 48% of respondents in the East Midlands also described themselves as being “worried.” Even more, 59% of the survey’s participants located in Humber and Yorkshire said that they had gambled in the previous 12 months, with 56% of interviewed East Midlands residents doing the same.</p>
<p>In November 2022, Gamcare announced a new Code of Conduct would become valid for land-based operators. During the same month, Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust and GamCare’s educational programs were revealing positive changes.</p>
