<p>Power of Gods: Hades review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Power of Gods: Hades is themed around the notorious Greek god of the dead.</p>
<p>Players will descend into the underworld, where a vicious three-headed hound and a variety of mysterious artifacts await. If they can stay one step ahead of Hades, players might unravel the secret to escaping this shadowy realm.</p>
<p>This slot is a good fit for fans of Greek mythology, and those in the mood for a dark atmosphere.</p>
<p>Win in the Power of Gods: Hades slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The understated soundtrack has a haunting tone that brings to mind an ominous scene in a fantasy film. The rattle of chains and distant moans help to establish that this world cannot be escaped.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will find golden helmets adorned with skulls, sceptre, a hooded figure with glowing eyes, and the iconic multi-headed hound of Hades. Hades himself, with a grave expression and a golden crown, appears as well.</p>
<p>The animation style draws on high fantasy aesthetics and may remind some players of medieval worlds as much as ancient Greek ones.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, a desolate landscape is shrouded in mist, and the silhouettes of trees sway in the wind. This adds to the slot’s spooky atmosphere and leaves players with no doubt they have fallen into the underworld.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics and music of Power of Gods: Hades create a dark fantasy world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Power of Gods: Hades is a five reel, three row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols vanish, making room for new symbols to fall into their place.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>When players land 6 or more Bonus symbols, the Hold the Jackpot Bonus is triggered.</p>
<p>Players begin the Hold the Jackpot Bonus with 3 respins and every time they land a new Bonus symbol, the number of respins is reset to 3. Throughout this feature, Bonus symbols remain stuck on the reels.</p>
<p>Options if player decides to buy-in for the bonus feature</p>
<p>Players continue playing the Hold the Jackpot Bonus until either the respins are used up or the reels are entirely filled with Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>Sticky Bonus symbols have the special property of remaining stuck to the reels for at least 5 spins. This increases players’ chances of triggering the Hold the Jackpot Bonus.</p>
<p>Fire symbols award players prizes with a value between 1x and 15x players’ bet.</p>
<p>During the Hold the Jackpot Bonus, players may see Mini, Minor, and Major Jackpot symbols appear at random. It is possible to win multiple Jackpots of the same kind during the round.</p>
<p>The Blue Fire symbol, Mystery symbol, and the Hades Mystery symbol can also appear during the Hold the Jackpot Bonus. Blue Fire symbols collect the values of Fire symbols and other Blue Fire symbols.</p>
<p>Mystery symbols may change into Fire, Blue Fire, or Jackpot symbols while Hades Mystery symbols may transform into Mini, Minor, or Major Jackpot symbols.</p>
<p>If players accumulate 15 Bonus symbols of any kind during the Hold the Jackpot Bonus, they are awarded the Grand Jackpot, which is 300x their total bet.</p>
<p>The Hold the Jackpot Bonus feature</p>
