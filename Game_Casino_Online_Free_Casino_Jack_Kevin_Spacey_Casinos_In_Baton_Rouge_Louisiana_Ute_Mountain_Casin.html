    <h1>Game Casino Online Free Casino Jack Kevin Spacey Casinos In Baton Rouge Louisiana Ute Mountain Casin</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm reading the comments and I realize that there are several of us scammed, a while ago I had been contacted by a guy who offered me to make money with the algorithms, he only asked me for a percentage of the profits once the process was finished, In fact, he made me deposit around 50 thousand pesos and he only asked me for my username. After a while he asked me that I had won a little but I had to continue depositing. At that time I immediately distrusted him and did not respond to him again. Later I got curious and went to the casino website and there was actually a balance of around 130 thousand pesos. At that moment I started betting and it went down to about 100 thousand pesos. It was at that moment that I tried to withdraw and it worked, at least The next day I had my money in the account, that's when I relaxed. On this occasion they contacted my wife offering her the same thing, and as it had previously worked she accepted and made the first deposit of approximately 50 thousand, the woman from the contact after a while told her that she had won around 2 million 800 thousand and that she should deposit more, something she didn't want, since she started to get scared anyway, the next day the woman on Instagram had already disappeared and her account had been closed. After a while I asked my wife what had happened to the account and she told me that she had never checked it, that's when I logged in and saw that her money was there, but it couldn't be withdrawn since an amount had to be spent first. equal to the deposit or bonuses, and this amount was approximately 2 million 800 thousand, but that balance did not appear anywhere, so I considered the money lost and used the page to distract myself and bet what I had since it would never return. It was so much that I began to win, I participated in tournaments and my balance increased as a bonus to the point that I managed to bet the entire balance that was required of me to make withdrawals, the 2 million 800 thousand, when I achieved that, which was this week, the money appeared as active to be able to make a withdrawal, at that time he had already earned enough and had a balance of more than 1 million 100 thousand. This week I made the entire withdrawal request, 1 million, it is supposed to take around 5 business days for it to appear in your account, which will be fulfilled next Tuesday. I will see how truthful the deposit is and how reliable the casino website is. Maybe it gave me a little hope to be able to recover what my wife invested, it wasn't much but it helps a lot. As soon as I have any news these days I will tell you immediately.</p>
