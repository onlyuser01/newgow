    <h1>Alina Casino Brand New Online Casinos Best Casino In Lake Tahoe Three Rivers Casino Florence Santan</h1>

<p>initially deposited around €500. As always as I am well aware of the process I wanted to submit the kyc documents as early as possible. In which I submitted driving license, ID card, passport, bank statements, a utility bill, as well as screen shots of my bank account showing the IBAN. I built my funds up to 1200 so 700 profit.</p>
<p>waited the full 72 hours and the contacted their online chat in which they approved the documents while I waited! Great! I was then told my account was full verified and I processed 2 withdrawals.</p>
<p>both were then rejected, with 4 conflicting emails for each withdrawal that stated on each separate email, my withdrawal was cancelled as my account isn’t verified, cancelled because it was back to a different payment method (it wasn’t, it was done via the same iban via bank transfer), another stated I can only do one withdrawal at a time and another stating I had not met the bonus terms (never had or used a bonus!)</p>
<p>I contacted them again and was told my account needs further verification, a photo of me holding up my passport. This was verified within 2 days, and another withdrawal for 500 was made on 11th December. As per there terms, as long as it sounds, they have until 5pm this evening and the 72 hours will be up. I contacted them and said my account is verified and my withdrawal pending. I have lost confidence this will happen and I am just waiting for the next excuse to appear. All the emails, chat logs etc have been saved. In short it’s been 3 weeks nearly and I’ve yet still to have a successful withdrawal, even though they now state my account is fully verified.</p>
