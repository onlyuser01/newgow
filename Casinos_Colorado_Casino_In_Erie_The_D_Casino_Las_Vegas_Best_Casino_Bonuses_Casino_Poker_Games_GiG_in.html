<p>The global iGaming technology and solutions provider, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced a new partnership with LuckyBet, a leading online casino operator. The new multi-year deal announced Tuesday will see the operator benefit from GiG's market-leading platform solution.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, LuckyBet will gain access to GiG's leading content management system (CMS), as well as the market-leading player account management (PAM) platform. The operator will leverage those leading solutions to help fuel its future growth.</p>
<p>Ultimately, LuckyBet plans to enter new regulated gambling markets that provide opportunities for further growth. At the same time, the operator plans to deliver unique experiences for its customer base. Such experiences include new loyalty options and personalized gameplay features, making the operator more attractive in the growing iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>GiG explained in a statement that initially, it joins forces with LuckyBet for five years. However, the iGaming technology company did not rule out a further extension with the operator in due time. With that in mind, thanks to GiG's leading solutions, LuckyBet customers will undoubtedly gain access to innovative experiences.</p>
<p>The new partnership with LuckyBet comes at a busy period for GiG. Only recently, the company selected Marcel Elfersy as its Chief Commercial Officer of Platform and Sportsbook.</p>
<p>What's more, earlier this month, GiG finalized the acquisition of AskGamblers, the leading complaint resolution affiliate website for the gambling industry. GiG acquired AskGamblers from Catena Media in a deal for â‚¬45m ($47.7m).</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the new deal, GiG's CEO, Richard Brown, shared his excitement on the topic saying: "The international emerging markets continue to be an important element within the global online casino sector, and the combination of our award-winning technology with LuckyBet will be in an ideal position to grow within these markets."</p>
<p>"Our ability to offer a personalized user experience is designed to help drive engagement and brand loyalty, increasing lifetime value, so we're really looking forward to seeing the full benefits that this new partnership offers," said the CEO in conclusion.</p>
<p>LuckyBet's CEO, Ian Parke, showed similar excitement about the collaboration with GiG. He outlined that LuckyBet plans to expand significantly, capturing growth opportunities within emerging markets and becoming a leading online casino brand.</p>
<p>According to Parke, GiG's leading technology will play a key role in the company's growth and deliver unique gaming experiences for its customers in new markets. "We believe, via a myriad of unique customer journeys delivered through GiG technology, significant market share can be achieved," he added. Last but not least, Parke predicted that the deal with GiG will continue to deliver benefits for many years.</p>
