<p>Earlier this week, Cordish Companies announced strategic executive appointments to its gaming division Cordish Gaming Group.</p>
<p>Cordish Gaming Promotes Bill Mikus, Edward Evans</p>
<p>Planning further growth of the Live! Casino brand, Cordish Gaming promoted Bill Mikus to SVP of human resources. Moreover, the company selected Edward Evans as director of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Cordish Gaming explained that the duo is going to collaborate to implement different employee engagement strategies related to the Live! Casino brand. Ultimately, the company seeks significant growth for the brand.</p>
<p>In his new position, Mikus will be responsible for planning, as well as the organization of all HR functions. Additionally, he will be responsible for engagement strategies, succession planning, as well as leadership development. Last but not least, Mikus will play a key role when it comes to collaboration between the management and property HR leaders.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Evans will be a part of Mikus’ team, spearheading the company’s DEI efforts. Evans will be responsible for proactive diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies development and implementation. Collaborating with team members from all levels, he will promote and develop programs that support diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>Further Growth Remains a Key Priority for Cordish Gaming</p>
<p>Before taking the position of SVP of HR, Mikus was most recently VP of HR for Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Philadelphia and Live! Casino Pittsburgh. He has more than 20 years of experience in the industry. Before joining Cordish, Mikus has taken leadership roles as a part of Caesars Entertainment for properties located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as well as Valley Forge Casino resort, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>“The growth of Cordish Gaming Group is changing the competitive landscape of our industry and I’m looking forward to continuing to build a team that reflects the excellence of our brand.” Bill Mikus, SVP of HR, Cordish Gaming Group</p>
<p>Evans has been a part of the Live! team for nearly 10 years now. Before being promoted to director of DEI, he has taken the position of director of culinary operations, as well as other key roles related to minority vendor relationships. Commenting on the topic, Evans outlined that his new position presents a real opportunity for him to “ensure our team reflects the communities where we operate and our Team Members can bring their full authentic selves to work every time they walk through our doors.”</p>
<p>“As Live! Casino continues to grow, we are building a team that shares our dedication to providing exceptional guest experiences and will push us in new directions.” Rob Norton, president of Cordish Gaming Group</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Cordish Companies’ Live! Casino brand is among the most successful casino entertainment resorts around the US. Besides resorts in Florida and Maryland, Cordish introduced two new first-class properties in Pennsylvania last year: Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Philadelphia and Live! Casino Pittsburgh. Exploring new iGaming, sports betting, and growth opportunities while building a strong and diverse team remain key priorities for the company.</p>
