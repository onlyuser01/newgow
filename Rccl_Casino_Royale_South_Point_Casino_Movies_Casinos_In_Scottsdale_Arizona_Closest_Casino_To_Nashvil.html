<p>Infromation about ClickandBuy casinos</p>
<p>ClickandBuy was a German e-money payment provider and digital wallet that was a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. The company discontinued its service in April 2016, which means it is now impossible to use it to make online casino deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>The decision to halt ClickandBuy's service came as a shock to its many consumers when the decision was announced. Up until that point, it had appeared to be a successful enterprise. Like many similar services, ClickandBuy relied on ease-of-use, speed, and security, and appeared to be good at all three. Users simply registered with their bank account or credit card info free of charge, and could then transfer money to merchants or individuals by entering their login details.</p>
<p>ClickandBuy also had a few nice features. Users could set monthly spending limits, and in 2012 the company allowed customers to make purchases via their mobile, a relatively new service at the time.</p>
<p>But perhaps the warning signs were there to see. After a history of security lapses, journalist Kristina Beer reported another 'hole' in ClickandBuy's security armor in 2013. Perhaps because of this, or maybe because of the increased competition in digital providers, the company suddenly announced it would discontinue its service in April 2016, without giving a reason.</p>
<p>According to the company website, customers had until six years after the termination date – April 2022 – to claim any funds still in their ClickandBuy account.</p>
<p>Alternatives to ClickandBuy casinos</p>
<p>ClickandBuy's sudden termination may have come as a shock to the German online payment industry, but there are several very good alternative eWallets available to German customers that can also be used in online casinos.</p>
<p>Skrill casinos</p>
<p>Founded in London as Moneybookers in 2001, Skrill actually has German roots with co-founder Benjamin Kullman hailing from Hamburg. Now recognized as one of the leading payment methods for top online casinos, it offers crypto services, an easy-to-use app, and is available on iOS and Android. Watch out for its high fees for withdrawing from Skrill to your credit card though, which can be as much as 7.5%.</p>
<p>This provider's popularity means many online casinos accept Skrill nowadays.</p>
<p>Neteller casinos</p>
<p>Did you know that Neteller was one of the first-ever digital wallets? Launched in 1999, it was responsible for 80% of online casino transactions by 2005. It even purchased Skrill in 2015 before both were absorbed by the PaySafe group not long after. Neteller's dominance has lessened since its glory years, with the emergence of several big rivals, but you can still find it in many Neteller-friendly casinos.</p>
<p>MuchBetter casinos</p>
<p>A baby compared to some of its competitors, MuchBetter has stood out for its innovative service since its launch in 2017. As well as offering quick real-time deposits into gaming accounts and MuchBetter casinos via the service's mobile app, it also promises some of the most advanced security measures around, including fingerprint IDs and device pairing.</p>
<p>There are cash limits to look out for, which has garnered some online complaints, but MuchBetter is still one of the most competitive payment methods available to German players.</p>
<p>Finding the best casinos</p>
<p>Despite ClickandBuy no longer being active, there are still many great online casinos available to casino players. The trick is finding them: a time-consuming process if you have to check each one.</p>
<p>The good news is Casino Guru has done the hard work for you. Every casino on our database has been scrutinized by our team of experts. They assess them according to objective factors, like how many complaints the site receives, then awards each one a Safety Index.</p>
<p>To see the top online casinos in your area, select the 'Recommended' filter. Start with these as they'll give you the best chance of having a good time playing online.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you may want to see new casinos, those fresh options that might just have a tempting welcome offer for you. In this case, just choose the 'Newly opened' filter, or go to our new online casinos page.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of other filters too, just in case the previous ones aren't enough — feel free to take a look through them. They let you sort sites by their game types, game provider, currency, and language, to name a few.</p>
<p>Or you may just want to see the full list. Select the 'All' filter to see everything in one place.</p>
<p>Note: You can read about the casino search process in more detail by going to our How to choose an online casino article. Here you'll find everything you need to know about locating that perfect site for you.</p>
<p>ClickandBuy casino bonuses</p>
<p>Many casinos that offer (or at least offered) ClickandBuy as a payment method will also offer online casino bonuses if you sign up. While, again, you won't be able to use ClickandBuy, you could make use of a bonus after making your first deposit (deposit bonus), or even get one just for signing up (no deposit bonus).</p>
<p>You can start by going to our list of casino bonuses and choosing your preferred method in the 'Payment Method' filter there. You should see offers of various shapes and sizes. To narrow these down, go to the 'Bonus Type' section and choose your preference: perhaps you're a fan of no deposit bonuses, in which case choose the 'no deposit bonus' option. Alternatively, go to our list of no deposit bonuses and choose 'ClickandBuy' there.</p>
<p>All options should be up-to-date and ready for you to use thanks to the Casino Guru team's hard work in refreshing the list.</p>
