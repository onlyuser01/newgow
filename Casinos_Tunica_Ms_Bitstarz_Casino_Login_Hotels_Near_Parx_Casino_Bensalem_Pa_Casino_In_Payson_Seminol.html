<p>The Massachusetts Gaming Commission has posted the latest results from sports gambling in the state, seeing the state pull in more than $654.4 million in November handle</p>
<p>This is the third largest for the nation in the month at the time of writing with the Bay State overtaking Maryland’s $550.7 million by a considerable margin and landing a long way behind New York which raked in $2.12 billion in total wagers placed, and New Jersey with its $1.62 billion in wagers. The results for Nevada are not out yet.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Breaks Sports Betting Records</p>
<p>Sports gambling has been a huge success in the state, it seems, although the activity only launched at the beginning of the year, after years of debates. The present-day results are well ahead of the previous record set by the state, $579.3 million in April, and well ahead of October’s $571.8 million pulled in total wagers.</p>
<p>In terms of taxes, Massachusetts collected $48.9 million in adjusted gross revenue, and translating into $9.8 million that went directly to the tax man. Since the industry launched in January this year, there has been $81.8 million paid in taxes to the state, strengthening endorsement for the segment and demonstrating that this has indeed been the right call.</p>
<p>What of the brands operating locally? Well, ESPN Bet, the newly-launched betting enterprise by the media company, has been doing fairly well, posting the third-best results in the November overall handle. ESPN Bet has succeeded Barstool Sportsbook as the Penn Entertainment-powered brand saw a strong uptake of sports bettors in its first month of operation and amid a determined marked push.</p>
<p>Local Brands Continue to Vie for Market Share</p>
<p>Results in different states have already demonstrated that initial analyses and expectations of the ESPN Bet name have been grossly underestimated, and ESPN Bet didn’t even complete a full month as it launched in mid-November. Part of ESPN’s success may have to do with the fact that the company has been building a product that resonates better with casual and women bettors.</p>
<p>DraftKings though remains in pole position and commands nearly 50% share of the market with ESPN Bet’s initial spending frenzy on promotional materials a minor disruption for the time being, but one that is bound to catch up with the company itself.</p>
<p>Naturally, the second-best performer in the market was FanDuel with BetMGM elbowed out of the way to fourth position.</p>
