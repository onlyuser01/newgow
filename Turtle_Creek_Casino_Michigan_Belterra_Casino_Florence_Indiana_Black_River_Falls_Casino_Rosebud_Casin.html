<p>The Canadian branch of the PointsBet sportsbook has unveiled a partnership with the Ottawa Redblacks team from the Canadian Football League. This agreement comes a few days before the launch of Ontario’s regulated betting market.</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada and the Redblacks Will Work Together</p>
<p>The deal will promote PointsBet’s brand among Canadian bettors ahead of the market launch. It will see the famous football team’s players don the operator’s logo on their jerseys for the upcoming sports season.</p>
<p>PointsBet’s branding will also have a presence on the Redblacks’ home venue – the TD Place Stadium in Ottawa, Ontario. As per the deal, the betting company will become the presenting sponsor of the PointsBet Sideline Club at the aforementioned stadium.</p>
<p>Thanks to its strategic moves, PointsBet secured the launch of its offerings in Ontario once the province officially legalizes gambling on April 4. The operator will have the opportunity to join the pioneers in this exciting new market. It will launch alongside companies such as BetMGM, LeoVegas, FanDuel, 888 Holdings, and Bet365, among others.</p>
<p>Mark Goudie, the president, and chief executive officer of the Redblacks’ parent company, Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group, welcomed PointsBet as a partner. He emphasized that the operator is a perfect match for the team, thanks to its genuine interest in Canadian football.</p>
<p>“We proudly wave the Canadian and CFL flag in the Nation’s Capital and it was important to us that this partnership is with a Canadian operator who not only knows the City of Ottawa but also loves the CFL and appreciates our Redblacks fans and the passion they have for our team and our league,” Goudie said.</p>
<p>He added that he is excited to see how the innovative and exciting relationship with PointsBet develops and what exceptional game experiences the PointsBet Sideline Club will deliver to the Ottawa Redblacks enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Scott Vanderwel, the chief executive officer of PointsBet Canada, described the Canadian Football League in Ottawa as one of the most Canadian things ever. Because of this, he is thrilled to join forces with the Ottawa Redblacks.</p>
<p>Vanderwel said that PointsBet Canada cannot wait to launch its premium sports betting offerings in the province and engage the sports franchise’s passionate fans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PointsBet continues its strife to offer premium experiences to sports bettors in the US. With Match Madness on the way, the operator launched promotional new betting products and signed a partnership with the sports media company Playmaker.</p>
