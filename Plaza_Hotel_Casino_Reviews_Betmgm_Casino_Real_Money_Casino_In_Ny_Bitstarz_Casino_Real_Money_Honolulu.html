    <h1>Plaza Hotel Casino Reviews Betmgm Casino Real Money Casino In Ny Bitstarz Casino Real Money Honolulu</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>on 20/05/2022 at 00:18:16 I start my session in the Esqueleto Explosivo 2 slot of Thunderkick, after having done over 150 spins at bet 0,50 the slot disconnects at 00:28:23: no problem of connection or otherwise, certainly a problem with them.</p>
<p>I take a screenshot of the disconnected game page and once back in the home the Betflag message appears "The ticket has been closed correctly": my session has been closed arbitrarily, without my being able to do anything.</p>
<p>I contact the assistance explaining the problem and requesting a refund between the difference in the balance of entry and exit and in addition a compensation since due to their problem I have lost the possibility of making a potential win.</p>
<p>After ignoring me for a long time and after contacting the telephone support where the assistant tells me that the complaint has been forwarded to Play N 'Go, (the manufacturer of the slot is Thunderkick, so it is not clear why it has cited Play N'Go) an email is sent to me stating that in the round ID 277654315002, that is the last shot made in the slot, the potential win is equal to 0.</p>
<p>I dispute a few things on this point:</p>
<p>The indicated round is present in the history and therefore the slot block was subsequent, so potential winnings could have come in the following spins, had the Slot not been arbitrarily disconnected (from them).</p>
<p>In the pdf in which the shot is indicated, the wrong time is indicated, that is 00:28:00, in that minute three shots were made: 277654259802 at 00:28:03, 277654573502 at 00:28:16, 277654315002 at 00 : 28: 23.</p>
<p>In the same pdf there are two external links: the first is this https://d10seqx7f7ksi7.cloudfront.net/common/tracking/tk-s1-g27/operator/tracking.html?gameRoundId=277654315002&amp;totalBet=0.500000, the second (which should mostrare il replay del round) Ã¨ questo https://d10seqx7f7ksi7.cloudfront.net/common/tracking/tk-s1-g27/operator/tracking.html?gameRoundId=277654315002&amp;totalBet=0.500000%20EUR&amp;accountBalanceBefore=154.660000%20EUR&amp;providerGameRoundId=3c672427edf5e1ffce1857e0174b6fbfd2e4c43a0b07270b8c00a8cd83b4b18716e34edbf79915ed41e10dc613c1bebb&amp;playerId=464971&amp;gameRoundStatusCode= COMPLETED &amp; trackingServiceUrl = https% 3A% 2F% 2Fgame-p1.thunderkick.com% 2Fmonolith &amp; operatorId = 3071 &amp; currencyIso = EUR &amp; startDate = 2022-05-19T22% 3A28 &amp; endDate = 2022-05-19T22% 3A28 &amp; gameSessionId = ebf3baed-45c3-d3ba-45-d3ba-45c3-45-d3b45-game s1-g27 &amp; replay = true , both have no data.</p>
<p>When, in the light of these untruthful data, I reaffirm the desire to obtain a refund and compensation equal to 5000x the stake, I initially asked the casino to find a meeting point by asking for 100 euros in real bonus, a meeting point obviously not found.</p>
<p>Lastly, I get this email from their support:</p>
<p>"Hi Alessandro,</p>
<p>the request for compensation is rejected, as if I had continued the game session, no one can predict the outcome of the following Rounds.</p>
<p>The error message interrupted the game session but did not result in financial shortages: the session history is attached</p>
<p>In any case, you will be compensated for the amount lost because it is recognized that you may have been bothered by the deteriorated gaming experience.</p>
<p>Our assistance is at your disposal.</p>
<p>The BetFlag team ".</p>
<p>In their gaming contract and in the service charter there is no case of this type, therefore the relevant legislation must be found in the Law.</p>
<p>From the last email received it seems clear that they took responsibility for the error, therefore they were held responsible for the same (in fact there was compensation as the difference between the entry and exit balance from the slot).</p>
<p>What I would like to point out is that, although the casino has acknowledged its "guilt", it liquidates everything with: "if I had continued the game session, no one can predict the outcome of the following Rounds." and "The error message interrupted the game session but did not lead to financial shortfalls."</p>
<p>In what sense did it not lead to economic shortfalls? Isn't this a loss of chance?</p>
<p>The mere fact that it was not possible to predict exactly the outcome of subsequent Rounds does not ignore the fact that there was a concrete possibility of making a certain win.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, the behavior of the casino was grossly unfair and this is my last attempt before going to court.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
