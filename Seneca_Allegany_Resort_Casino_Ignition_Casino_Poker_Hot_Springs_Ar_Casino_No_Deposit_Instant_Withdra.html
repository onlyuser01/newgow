    <h1>Seneca Allegany Resort Casino Ignition Casino Poker Hot Springs Ar Casino No Deposit Instant Withdra</h1>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>I have 3 accounts at 3 casinos with Winzon Group.</p>
<p>Stakezon, Iamslotty and ArmedBet. I played the most at Stakezon.</p>
<p>Well I know how gambling works, but now I have the feeling that something is rigged at these casinos. There has never been a really big win in any of these casinos.</p>
<p>Mom tells me in the chat the games have an RTP of 95-98, but the games themselves show an RTP of mostly 88-90.</p>
<p>Also, and here is my suspicion of fraud:</p>
<p>Sometimes, not always, multiple games are shown. So I'm looking for a game by name and get 3x the same game to choose from. I believe that in addition to the regular slots, fake ones are also deposited.</p>
<p>Sounds strange, but you win there remarkably rarely and little. It took me a long time to realize this, but something is wrong with these casinos.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't prove it. Maybe you can help me, I feel betrayed. I know that in the long run the house wins, but I know too many casinos for that. Winzon Group cheats. Is there a realistic possibility of getting at least part of my money back?</p>
<p>The amount in dispute is fictitious because I had to specify something.</p>
<p>Many Thanks.</p>
