<p>On Thursday, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board granted five sports betting licenses for Boyd Gaming’s Acadiana-Shreveport casinos. This brings the total number of state-issued licenses for sports betting to 13.</p>
<p>Louisiana Builds Out Sports Betting Market</p>
<p>According to the Lafayette Daily Advertiser, Ronnie Johns, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board (LGCB) Chair, said he signed licenses to Boyd’s Sam’s Town, Treasure Chest, Amelia Belle, Amelia, and Evangeline Downs.</p>
<p>Johns added that the licenses were effective Friday but that he wasn’t certain when casinos would accept bets.</p>
<p>The Paragon Casino in Marksville houses a 14th Louisiana sportsbook. However, it is managed by the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana. It is not regulated by the LGCB.</p>
<p>Other state-approved licenses for sports betting are available at the Horseshoe, Margaritaville, Boomtown in Bossier City, and Boomtown Casinos in Harvey, Golden Nugget, and L’Auberge Casinos in Lake Charles.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting was approved by 55 of the 64 Louisiana parishes. However, lawmakers needed to create the necessary framework to tax and regulate sports wagers during the 2021 spring legislative session. All current options for sports betting are available through on-site betting parlors or sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Caldwell, Catahoula, and Franklin will continue to prohibit sports betting.</p>
<p>Mobile Apps On Their Way</p>
<p>Johns stated that it will take at least until January for casinos to implement their mobile apps. This is the same timeframe expected for restaurants and bars to secure sports betting kiosks. This segment is controlled by the Louisiana Lottery.</p>
<p>Mobile applicants were slower to be licensed than on-site sportsbooks because they had previously been licensed to operate in Louisiana. Mobile bookmakers have never been licensed by the state.</p>
<p>Louisiana State Police troopers were tasked to vet license applicants. They were relieved of that responsibility in the fall to help with hurricane recovery.</p>
<p>There are currently two licensed casinos in Louisiana that are still shuttered. One riverboat casino in Lake Charles was destroyed by a hurricane and hit a bridge. It plans to reopen as a resort in 2022. Lake Charles is located in Southwestern Louisiana.</p>
<p>Another license holder has closed its riverboat casino near Slidell in northwestern Louisiana. It plans to reopen it as a land-based hotel-casino north of New Orleans. On December 11, the public will vote on the project in St. Tammany Parish.</p>
