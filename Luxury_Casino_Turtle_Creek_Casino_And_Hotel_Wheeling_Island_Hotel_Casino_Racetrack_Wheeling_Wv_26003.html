<p>Online casino and sports betting company Rush Street Interactive (RSI) announced today that on June 30, 2022, its online casino and sportsbook brand RushBet launched in Mexico.</p>
<p>Always Put Players First</p>
<p>The launch of RushBet in Mexico brings over 350 of the latest slot titles and table games, including live dealer games to a market featuring more than 130 million potential players, while the brand’s online sportsbook offers wagering opportunities on soccer matches from the English Premier League (EPL), LigaMX and Spanish LaLiga, as well as some of the US majors such as the NFL, MLB and NBA.</p>
<p>Thrilled to “bring the millions of Mexican gaming enthusiasts into the expanding RushBet community,” RSI’s chief executive officer Richard Schwartz pointed out that RSI would bring in Mexico its “best-in-class” products and services that were already much appreciated by players in Colombia.</p>
<p>“At RushBet we always put the player experience first – focusing on earning and retaining player trust, be it through our array of proprietary betting options, fast and easy payouts, or efficient and helpful customer support.” Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>RSI made history in 2018 when it became the first US gaming operator to launch sports betting operations in a Latin American jurisdiction after the launch of RushBet.co in Colombia.</p>
<p>In 2021, RushBet received the Sportsbook Operator of the Year award at the SBC Latinoamérica Awards and the brand will be now looking to replicate its success in a second gaming jurisdiction from the Latin American region.</p>
<p>‘Create the Best and Most Trusted’ Gaming Experience</p>
<p>RSI’s launch in Mexico was paved in January when the Chicago-based gaming company partnered with Mexican media conglomerate Grupo Multimedios and both parties signed a 25-year agreement to operate online casino and sports betting countrywide.</p>
<p>Besides leveraging the online gaming license held by one of Grupo Multimedios’ subsidiaries, RSI will also benefit from the vast array of media assets and distribution channels of the conglomerate to facilitate promotional activities and content integration.</p>
<p>Equally excited to launch in partnership with RSI, Grupo Multimedios’ co-chief executive officer Angel Cong stated that the partnership would look to leverage Grupo’s media assets to achieve the same popularity RSI already has in North America and Colombia, seeking to “create the best and most trusted online casino and sports betting experience in the Mexican market.”</p>
<p>Having established a strong presence in its home base of Monterrey, Grupo Multimedios expanded its coverage throughout Mexico and also into several other businesses beyond media, including ownership in sports teams such as the Sultanes de Monterrey from the Mexican Baseball Leagues and professional basketball team Fuerza Regia.</p>
<p>The launch in Mexico significantly expanded RushBet’s presence in Latin America, adding a country with a population of over 130 million to the 50 million in Colombia.</p>
