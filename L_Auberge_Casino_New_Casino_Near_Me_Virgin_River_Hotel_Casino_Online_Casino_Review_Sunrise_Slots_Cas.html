<p>Evoplay has debuted a new game inspired by soccer and innovating on the slot experience in exciting fresh ways</p>
<p>Penalty Shoot-out: Street is the latest game by Evoplay, which builds on the premise already introduced with penalty Shootout Instant Game. The new game is also focused on Latin America and it pulls right at the heartstrings of soccer fans in the region. This fresh release comes hot on the tail of another soccer-themed game, Soccer Solo Striker.</p>
<p>Evoplay’s Passion for Soccer Themes</p>
<p>Instead of taking action to one of the glamorous stadiums of the region, however, Evoplay has picked the streets of Salvador as the backdrop for its latest game. Players will get to play a national team of their choice and try to score against a goalkeeper on a concrete pitch.</p>
<p>The game itself features a progress bar that will be awarding multipliers that range from twice the player bet to 32 times the amount. Penalty Shoot-Out: Street focuses on creating immersive and highly-entertaining experiences that want to simulate the visceral joy that fans get while watching a real soccer game.</p>
<p>Players who win in a penalty shoot-out round can play in a sort of a “crash style” mechanic whereby they can continue betting for a chance to multiply their winnings or cash out and start over. Each time you win and don’t cash out, you stand to win much more in theory.</p>
<p>Evoplay CEO Ivan Kravchuk spoke about the launch of the new product, calling it a product that first and foremost captures the unique setting of Brazil and Latin America.</p>
<p>Double or Nothing and Multiplying Your Wins</p>
<p>The original game was already a fantastic product, but enhancing it through the new UX, immersive features, and joy of scoring a goal all adds up to much better gameplay across the board, the executive said.</p>
<p>“Bringing the excitement of street soccer to the comfort of a user’s home, we are confident that our latest addition to our Football Pack will continue to deliver fantastic results to our partners,” Kravchuk concluded.</p>
<p>Evoplay has been looking to create enjoyable experiences for its players. The company launched the $130,000 tournament series running from June 12 through August 22 to give players in its network and across its games even more chances to win something extra.</p>
