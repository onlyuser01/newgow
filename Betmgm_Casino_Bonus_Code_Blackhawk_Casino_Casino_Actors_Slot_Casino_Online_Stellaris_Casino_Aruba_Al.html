<p>Efforts for the repeal of Alabama’s prohibition on gambling date back more than two decades. Back in 1999, voters in the state rejected a proposal that called for the establishment of a lottery and similar efforts since have not gained much traction. While lawmakers identify the potential benefits of legal gambling, no bill has made it far enough to change Alabama’s state constitution and introduce some form of the activity.</p>
<p>Considering that gambling is prohibited as a part of the state’s constitution, lawmakers need to pass a constitutional amendment to pave the way for gambling. There is a chance for Alabama residents to vote for or against a gambling constitutional amendment during the upcoming 2024 presidential election ballot. Despite the benefits legal gambling may bring, not everyone agrees that the legalization of the activity is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>State Sen. Chris Elliott, who was recently interviewed by Jeff Poor, the host of “The Jeff Poor Show,” on Mobile radio FM Talk 106.5, spoke about the potential dangers of putting a gambling constitutional amendment on the upcoming ballot. “The folks who are elected officials are all very keen on those politics. So, I think it is pretty reasonable to say it would be a mistake to put gaming on the presidential election (ballot), that it would drive up Democrats’ turnout,” he explained as quoted by 1819 News.</p>
<p>Gaming Discussion Has a Long Way to Go</p>
<p>According to Elliott, neither of the chambers would be interested in such a result. The Senator admitted he will continue monitoring the topic and pay close attention to any changes. Yet, Elliott confirmed that the legalization of gambling is a topic that requires a lot of discussion and time before becoming a reality. “It is something I certainly will be sitting back and watching to see how it goes in the House and what happens. But I’m not getting down into the details of it until something actually matriculates. It is very much a work in progress,” he explained.</p>
<p>“But I’ll be honest with you: I think the whole gaming conversation has got miles and miles to go before we get to any kind of solution.“ State Sen. Chris Elliott</p>
<p>State Reps. Andy Whitt and Chris Blackshear are among the lawmakers who are reportedly supporting the legalization of gambling in Alabama. Amid the growing concerns about the impact of illegal gambling, Whitt hinted at plans for a new bill that seeks to combat the illegal offering through “blanket penalties.” The lawmaker explained that illegal gambling results in an increase in other crimes such as drug use or violent crimes, which underlines the need for effective legislation that combats the activity.</p>
