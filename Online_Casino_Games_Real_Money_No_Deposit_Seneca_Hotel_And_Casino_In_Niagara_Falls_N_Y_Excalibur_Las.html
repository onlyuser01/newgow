<p>Thunderkick has agreed to expand in North America, with the iGaming supplier looking to make its presence in high-performing online casino markets felt. This is why the company has worked on entering Ontario, Canada, and has now succeeded after receiving approval from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission (AGCO) of the province.</p>
<p>The approval will allow it to roll out its products locally and make sure that it’s one of the well-established local suppliers moving forward. Thunderkick has already had success back in Europe, having secured entries in important markets. Thunderkick will be working to strengthen its presence in Ontario, but also Sweden, where it’s based, as well as Portugal and Italy.</p>
<p>In terms of growth, the supplier has been enjoying steady going, and it’s committed to building more unique titles that help pin its name on the iGaming radar. Some of the company’s most notable releases over the years include 12 Bolts of Thunder, Esqueleto Explosivo 2, Beat the Beast and more.</p>
<p>Thunderkick has been in the industry for more than 12 years now, building solid titles and delivering them through a Remote Gaming Server that makes it easy to deploy games in different parts of the world without sacrificing performance in any way.</p>
<p>Thunderkick already works with a number of trusted and respected industry giants, including LeoVegas, MrGreen, PokerStars, ComeOn, Betsson, and many others. Commenting on this new opportunity in Ontario, Thunderkick CCO Svante Sahlström welcomed the chance to see his company take off in yet another coveted market:</p>
<p>"Ontario is likely to be a significant strategic move for us this year, and I think we’ll also look back on it as an important marker in the company’s development in years to come."</p>
<p>He assured that the company is all about long-term growth and compliance and that Thunderkick is looking to deliver on outstanding experiences for its players. Thunderkick has been growing with various partners in the past few months, including a tie-up with Alea and one with Skywind Group.</p>
