    <h1>Virginia Beach Casino Hotel Near Firekeepers Casino Battle Creek Mi Treasure Mile Casino Mardi Gras</h1>

<p>After announcing the launch of its table management software at Lake of the Torches Casino Resort in Lac Du Flambeau, Wisconsin in June, Table Trac is ready to take its expansion on the American market one step forward. The company which operates in numerous casinos spread across various areas in the US, Australia, Central, and South America, and the Caribbean has signed a new deal with Lucky Strike Casino. Table Trac will install CasinoTrac, its highly appreciated online content management system at the casino operated by Stillwater Gaming.</p>
<p>CasinoTrac – Great Value and Stability</p>
<p>The casino located at 444 E Williams Street in Nevada’s Carson City will benefit from all the perks of the proven CasinoTrac system. The management system offers comprehensive insights to casino businesses, covering anything from revenue to accounting, audits, IT, promotions, and special Players Club options. The system currently processes millions of transactions on a daily basis at more than 150 casinos spread all over the globe. CasinoTrac enables casinos to enjoy complete functionality in all their operations and it is expected to fully rise to the expectations through the new deal.</p>
<p>Stillwater Gaming’s program manager Scott Dale described CasinoTrac as a solution that can generate “great value”, as it is created and supported by professionals “truly focused on the end-user – casino guests”. Dale also praised the system’s impressive stability Stillwater was able to observe during the two years of use at two of their casinos. Table Trac’s full dedication to gaming systems was also emphasized by Dale as a means of driving “the quality of the system and the culture of the Table Trac Team”.</p>
<p>Stillwater Gaming currently operates several casino properties located in Nevada’s Lyon County, Carson Valley, and Churchill County.</p>
<p>Table Trac Proud to Expand with Stillwater</p>
<p>Speaking about the new partnership, Table Trac’s president Chad Hoehne also expressed the company’s thrill to be expanding its foothold on the American market with Stillwater Gaming. He added that CasinoTrac’s online customer management system has started to gain a strong reputation among operators thanks to its stability and added value. The system is rich in versatile features and does not require operators to buy extra modules.</p>
<p>It also includes free upgrades and works with a built-in hourly algorithm for auto-tiering solutions, an intelligent dispatch system, and a rewards offer generator that is also built into the system. The system that is scalable for casinos of all sizes comes with a patented management system for table games. It also has a simple user interface and architecture that do not require complex maintenance. At the beginning of the year, Table Trac sealed a similar deal with StageCoach Hotel and Casino in Beatty, Nevada.</p>
