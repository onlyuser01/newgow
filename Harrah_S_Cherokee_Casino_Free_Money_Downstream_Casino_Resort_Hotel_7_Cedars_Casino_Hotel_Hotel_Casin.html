<p>$600M Oklahoma Tribal Casino Expansion Targets Texas Gamblers, Experts Say</p>

<p>Oklahoma’s Choctaw Casino &amp; Resort opened its $600M hotel and gaming floor addition earlier this month. It is seen as an added way to draw players from nearby North Texas.</p>

<p>The Durant, Okla. gaming property is approximately 14 miles from the border with Texas. It is some 88 miles to Dallas.</p>
<p>Improvements include a 1,000-room, 21-story hotel, more gambling options, and additional restaurants. There is also a collection of Choctaw art.</p>
<p>Texans account for the vast majority of gambling activity in Oklahoma,” Clyde Barrow, chairman of the political science department at the University of Texas – Rio Grande Valley, told Casino.org. He estimates Texans are probably spending $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion per year at Oklahoma casinos.</p>
<p>“This is no surprise at all,” Mark P. Jones, a political science fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute, told Casino.org when asked about the expansion.</p>
<p>“The Dallas Fort Worth [DFW] Metroplex has 6.4 million residents. When you add in adjacent areas of North Texas, the total population in the region is twice that of the entire state of Oklahoma.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma Dependent on Texas Gamblers</p>
<p>He points out that Oklahoma’s casino industry “has long depended on players from the Lone Star State.</p>
<p>Without Texans, most of the casinos in southern Oklahoma are not economically viable, as they depend heavily on Texas visitors to turn a profit, be it from the DFW Metroplex or from mid-sized metro areas, such as Sherman and Wichita Falls,” Jones added.</p>
<p>Casino companies, especially Las Vegas Sands, have tried to open commercial gaming properties in Texas. But political opposition so far has prevented the move from getting enacted.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma casino expansion “will have a modest negative impact on efforts to open casinos in Texas,” Jones said.</p>
<p>He says as long as Greg Abbott is governor and Dan Patrick is lieutenant governor, both Republicans, prospects for casino gambling in Texas “will remain remote.”</p>
<p>Also, if Texas does ever open commercial casinos, “most of the southern Oklahoma casinos, such as the Choctaw Casino &amp; Resort and the nearby Chickasaw Winstar World Casino &amp; Resort, begin the process of either shutting down or substantially scaling back their operations,” Jones said.</p>
<p>But for now, “The more the Choctaw invest in casino expansion targeting Texas visitors, the harder they are going to work — via campaign donations and lobbying — to prevent the opening of casinos in Texas,” Jones added.</p>
<p>Reconsidering Texas Casinos</p>
<p>Proposals to legalize casinos will be back on the Texas legislative agenda in 2023, when the legislature next convenes in regular session, Barrow said.</p>
<p>Without any other local gaming option, Texans will visit neighboring states for recreation,” University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus said.</p>
<p>“The demand for gaming is strong in large urban areas, so proponents of expanded gaming in Texas can clearly show demand for the product.”</p>
