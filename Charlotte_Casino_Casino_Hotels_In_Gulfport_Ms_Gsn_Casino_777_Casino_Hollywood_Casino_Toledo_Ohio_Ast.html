<p>A sponsorship deal between online payment provider AstroPay and Burnley FC has been further strengthened to include shirt sponsorship for the women’s shirt and the newly-installed dugouts at Turf Moor, the English Premier League (EPL) club announced.</p>
<p>The partnership between Burnley and its Official Payment Solution Partner AstroPay deepened after the payment company agreed to sponsor the women’s shirt for the remainder of the 2021/22 season, as well as the new dugout area installed at Turf Moor, home of The Clarets.</p>
<p>Burnley commercial director Gordon Kaye expressed the club’s delight at the expanded partnership that would see AstroPay become front-of-shirt sponsor for the women’s team and the new dugouts.</p>
<p>He commended AstroPay’s decision to “join a growing number of sponsors” choosing to support the women’s team, “looking forward to continuing to work closely with them throughout the season.”</p>
<p>As part of the new sponsorship deals, AstroPay’s logo will feature on the front of both home and away women shirts, as well as on headrests and in the technical area of the newly-installed dugouts at Turf Moor. The range of women shirts featuring the new sponsor will be available for fans to purchase in The Clarets Store, the EPL club outlined.</p>
<p>‘Achieve Great Things Together’</p>
<p>Burnley FC and the founded in 2009 global payment provider AstroPay initially partnered during the 2018/19 season and revived their partnership at the beginning of 2021/22 season by signing a sponsorship deal to feature the brand on the men’s shirt sleeve.</p>
<p>AstroPay CEO Mikael Lijtenstein was delighted to expand AstroPay’s partnership with Burnley FC “through these new sponsorship deals, looking forward to “achieve great things together.”</p>
<p>“As two innovative organisations, we share a similar ethos of being forward thinking and creative, which is why the prospect of becoming Burnley FC Women’s front of shirt sponsor was so appealing. The club is making great strides in women’s football, and we wanted to be a part of the journey.” Mikael Lijtenstein, CEO, AstroPay</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2009, AstroPay has grown to offer an efficient and reliable payment solution to its customers, linking businesses with consumers across Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe.</p>
<p>Recently, AstroPay teamed with the T20 cricket team of Sri Lanka to feature on the team’s leading arm jersey, as well as on the front of their training bib.</p>
