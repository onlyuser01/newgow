<p>The new Committee is supported by Aristocrat Technologies, Light &amp; Wonder and AXIS.ai and seeks to elevate the standards for cybersecurity in the gambling sector</p>
<p>The largest technical standards development organization focused on creating standards for the global gaming industry, the International Gaming Standards Association (IGSA), announced it forged a new committee that seeks to elevate the standards for cybersecurity. Confirmation about the new Cyber Resiliency Committee (CRC) came Thursday and it comes amid an increasing concern about a growing number of cybersecurity threats and issues.</p>
<p>IGSA confirmed that the new Committee is supported by experts within the gambling sector and recognizable companies, including AXES.ai, Light &amp; Wonder, as well as Aristocrat Technologies. Ultimately, the CRC is expected to help develop standards for cybersecurity governance, cyber risk management, as well as a framework control standard for the gambling sector and operators within the sector.</p>
<p>The announcement about the new Committee comes after earlier this year, IGSA announced the development of a Responsible Gaming Committee (RGC) in an effort to elevate responsible gambling standards and help reduce problem gambling. At the time of the announcement, IGSA revealed that the RGC will help its members better tackle problem gambling and strengthen their responsible gaming efforts.</p>
<p>The New Initiative Brings Excitement</p>
<p>Peter DeRaedt, IGSA’s president, spoke about the recently created CRC, revealing that it represents the efforts of the Association to develop a cyber standard that protects the gambling sector. He outlined that the new Committee is developed with the efforts of Gold and Platinum IGSA members.</p>
<p>Moreover, DeRaedt added: “This committee will solicit experts within our membership to create ready-to-use standards to improve cyber resilience.” Finally, he thanked IGSA’s chairman, Earle G. Hall, for accepting the role of interim chair of the CRC.</p>
<p>“IGSA is being called to lead a concerted effort to create cyber standards to protect our industry and that is exactly what we will do thanks to the incredible leadership within our Platinum and Gold members.“ Peter DeRaedt, president of IGSA</p>
<p>Hall, who also serves as the CEO of AXES.ai and chairman of IGSA, added that it is great to see members of the Association join forces to address a number of rising cybersecurity issues for the gambling sector. “Our members are clear that cybersecurity has to be a top priority for all gaming suppliers in our industry to protect operators and our industry at large,” he added. Finally, he thanked Light &amp; Wonder and Aristocrat for their efforts in this initiative.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, IGSA announced the creation of its Ethical AI Committee. This was another effort by the Association to improve the gambling sector as a whole in addition to other important initiatives.</p>
