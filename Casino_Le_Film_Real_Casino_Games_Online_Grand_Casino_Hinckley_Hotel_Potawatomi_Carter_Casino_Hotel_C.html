<p>Expert in compliance matters OneComply has signed a landmark partnership with PrintScan, a company that takes secure fingerprint scans and serves as a method of key-personnel verification in front of different regulatory services. This partnership is hailed as a game changer by both companies that expect to make the regulatory and verification process much easier, streamlined, and robust.</p>
<p>Instead of jumping through regulatory hoops, a fingerprint would now do. A scan can be printed and included as part of any regulatory application process with state institutions. This partnership makes it easier for gaming license applicants to get the necessary paperwork across to the relevant authority.</p>
<p>Presently, all regulators require certified fingerprints for key persons. This process is much simpler with the integration of PrintScan. The partnership deals away with a popular complaint from applicants who will be able to expedite the licensing process, knowing that they have complied with prerequisites in full, and focus on other aspects of launching their gaming assets.</p>
<p>OneComply CEO and Co-founder Cameron Conn were happy with the partnership, arguing that new and existing clients would both benefit from this PrintScan integration. He explained:</p>
<p>"The ability to request fingerprint cards and track their status directly within OneComply provides our clients with another important tool to efficiently prepare regulatory submissions."</p>
<p>Conn too described fingerprint cards as a major pain point for the industry but assured that this partnership will actually bring a much-desired change and process optimization that is compliant with regulatory expectations and makes it easier for businesses to move ahead with a license application.</p>
<p>PrintScan CEO Thomas Van Schuyler welcomed the deal and said that it was a milestone for the industry. He assured me that PrintScan has the technological capabilities to guarantee compliance with regulatory standards.</p>
<p>The technology used involves FBI-certified printers, Schuyler said. There is an ironclad VaultID system which is where the prints come out of, the executive continued as he spoke about the level of security used by the company.</p>
<p>OneComply has been in the news a lot recently. It attended a number of expos and won the EGR B2B Award for Corporate Services Supplier of 2022. The company has been moving with state regulation in the United States, launching Ohio sports betting applications to help applicants make quick submissions to the relevant state authorities and do so in the most painless and efficient manner possible.</p>
