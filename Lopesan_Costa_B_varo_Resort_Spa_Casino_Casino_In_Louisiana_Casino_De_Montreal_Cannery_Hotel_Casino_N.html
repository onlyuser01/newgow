    <h1>Lopesan Costa B varo Resort Spa Casino Casino In Louisiana Casino De Montreal Cannery Hotel Casino N</h1>

<p>Hello dear Casinoguru team and Pinsino casino,</p>
<p>Yesterday, November 1st, 2023, I made my first deposit of €250 and used my welcome bonus (deposited and played)</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to make a win with my real money right at the beginning of around €8614.</p>
<p>The problem is the credit, although it is real money, it was transformed into my bonus money and I had to implement the entire sales requirement of 15,000 points/€</p>
<p>The bonus money has a maximum withdrawal limit of 10 x deposit.</p>
<p>I find it unfair that the win, even though it was won with real money, is immediately transformed into the bonus credit and is subject to a maximum payout limit and you still have to implement your wagering requirement and you are forced to continue playing even though you have already won, just to meet the bonus wagering requirement ( although this is and was a real money win and I would like to pay out my real money winnings)</p>
<p>Screenshots are available, gameplay can be viewed and can be sent to you.</p>
<p>The live chat consciously cannot help me because it talks about something else instead of seeing and recognizing the naked truth. Insight was not recognized and given but something else was constantly explained to me even though I didn't ask about it.</p>
<p>My first deposit was €250 and I got a 100% bonus, the lowest amount I had while playing and you can also check this in the game history was a value of €413!</p>
<p>Total game credit was €500! Up to a value of €250 in the game, every win is a real money win as long as the value is not less than €250!</p>
<p>As emphasized, the lowest value was €413 during the 100% bonus (game)</p>
<p>I was able to cash out €7,517 after wagering (I had to wager €15,000/Points/€). It wasn't possible to cancel the bonus because the winnings were converted into my bonus money and that's exactly the problem and the problem and that's unfair! !!!</p>
<p>Bonustherms/Point:</p>
<p>1.9 If you play with a bonus, use your real money balance first and then your bonus balance.</p>
<p>1.6 Unless otherwise stated for a specific bonus, a maximum betting limit of 4 EUR/CAD (or equivalent in other currencies) per game round/spin applies to all games as long as a bonus is active in the player's account or as long as winnings from the mentioned Bonus, are part of the player balance. It is strictly forbidden to use the "buy free spins" feature with an active bonus. Violation of this rule will result in the bonus and all resulting winnings played with the active bonus being cancelled.</p>
<p>1.16 The following games are strictly prohibited with an active bonus (unless otherwise described in the bonus): virtual sports games, jackpot games, table games, video poker, live games and and the following slot games: Aztec,......... ...take the bank.</p>
<p>In the event of a violation, the bonus and all winnings earned with the bonus will be canceled.</p>
<p>As you can see from the terms and conditions, split winnings (bonus money or real money winnings) are always possible</p>
<p>I ask for the cash register system to be overhauled and the winnings recognized as well as improvements at the IT level (cash register system gaming system winnings)</p>
<p>In other casinos this is completely normal and real money winnings can be paid out and this works without any problems! and here an outdated system is used to advantage to make a profit for the casino and to harm the players.</p>
<p>Thank you very much and a quick clarification and improvement for all sides, both players and casinos, for fair gaming (Fair Play)</p>
<p>Good day and thank you for your cooperation</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Your Jonamia (DD)</p>
