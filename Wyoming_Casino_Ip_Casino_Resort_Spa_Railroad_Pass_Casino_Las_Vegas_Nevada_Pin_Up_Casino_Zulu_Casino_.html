<p>Atlantean GigaRise review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around the mythical lost city of Atlantis.</p>
<p>Set in an enchanting underwater world, this game features reels framed by towering pillars and ancient vases. Fish swim among the classical ruins of the submerged civilization and players will begin to get the sense that there is something magical about this place.</p>
<p>Players will snag treasure in the depths of the ocean while enjoying the reef scenery. Those in the mood for a whimsical adventure will especially enjoy this game.</p>
<p>Win in the Atlantean GigaRise slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a mysterious classical melody that livens up upon spins. Wins are celebrated with an exciting chiming that makes it feel like players are solving the puzzle of the strange world.</p>
<p>The architecture of the city will bring to mind the majestic cities of the ancient Greek world. Little details such as the shells carved above the pillars help reinforce the ocean theme.</p>
<p>Due to the undersea setting, the entire world is tinged blue, with waves gently pulsing above the players and catching sunlight. The animation is self-aware of its cartoon style and is high quality.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with valuable relics such as harps, swords, and vases. A pearl in a clam shell looks tempting and seems right at home in a place adorned with colourful coral.</p>
<p>Huge win in one of the bonus features of the game</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Atlantean GigaRise is a five reel slot with up to 8 rows, depending on the Trident symbol, which has the power to increase the height of a reel by +1.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for landing at least three matching symbols in adjacent reels, from left to right.</p>
<p>The gameplay has a good pace and will keep the players engaged.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols.</p>
<p>The Bonus game is triggered when players land a Trident symbol on a reel that has reached the maximum height.</p>
<p>The Gold Bonus is one of the randomly chosen options for the Bonus round</p>
<p>When the Bonus game begins, players will have the option of three different prize sets. While in the feature, there is one payline, and any symbol that lands in it provides a prize. These prizes include up to x20 players’ bets, free spins, as well as free spins with guaranteed Bonus games.</p>
<p>After the Bonus game concludes, the triggering reel is reduced to a height of 3 rows.</p>
<p>Bonus round has just a single winning line</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is launched when players land 3 or more Free Spin symbols. The number of free spins they receive goes up for landing more Free Spin symbols.</p>
