<p>The Napoli vs. Inter game on Sunday, December 3, is a duel between the reigning Serie A champion and the No. 1 favorite to become the 2023-24 season champ</p>
<p>Things are heating up in the 2023-24 Italian Serie A, where (at least) four teams still dream of the title. Inter Milan is sitting at the top of the table with 32 points right now, which is two more than Juventus, as well as six more than third-place AC Milan, and eight more than the reigning champion Napoli.</p>
<p>That’s why Sunday’s Napoli vs. Inter game is of incredible importance. Losing the game could mean losing the shot at defending the title for Napoli. And in the case of Inter losing, the race for the trophy could get much, much more exciting.</p>
<p>Napoli vs. Inter Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Napoli +188 Draw +250 Inter +138</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Over 2.5 -133 Under 2.5 +104</p>

<p>Napoli Desperate to Improve Their Home Stats</p>
<p>In the past, Napoli’s stadium was their fortress when they lost rarely. This season, however, they’re 2-1-3 at home in the Serie A. To make things even worse, they’re without a single win at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona since September.</p>
<p>The last time they played in Naples, they lost 1-0 to Empoli, a team that’s sitting in the relegation zone. What happened in that game was that they just couldn’t get on target despite making 18 attempts. In comparison, Empoli’s players made 10 fewer.</p>
<p>The reason why they failed to score is that their best striker Victor Oshimen was out with an injury. He made his comeback since but is yet to start a game. That, however, is something that’s likely to happen on Sunday.</p>
<p>Will this make Napoli more dangerous? Probably, but finding the net against Serie A’s best defense won’t be easy.</p>
<p>Nerazzurri to Show They’re Serie A Title Material</p>
<p>Inter Milan is 10-2-1 this season, with its only loss in the Italian Serie A happening back in September. “I Nerazzurri” are great offensively, scoring 30 goals so far, which is more than any other team in the league. The man they need to thank for this is Lautaro Martinez, the current scoring leader in the Serie A.</p>
<p>The boys from Milan are also great at the back. So far, they’ve conceded just seven goals, which accounts for roughly a goal every two games. This makes their defense the best in the league.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s kind of surprising that they conceded three goals to Benfica in the Champions League on Wednesday, all of which were scored by their former playmaker Joao Mario.</p>
<p>The explanation behind this is that Inter’s starting goalkeeper Yann Sommer didn’t play in that game. But the Swiss goalie will come back on Sunday.</p>
<p>Napoli vs. Inter Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a real spectacle. Both teams are incredibly motivated to win, with Inter being the team with player quality on its side. This, however, doesn’t mean the visitors will necessarily win. After all, the game is played in Naples, where the Sky Blues will get amazing support from the stands.</p>
<p>Napoli is without a home loss to Inter since their stadium was renamed in honor of Diego Maradona. We think that won’t change this Sunday. Instead, we think the most likely outcome is that we’ll see a draw.</p>
<p>Pick: Napoli vs. Inter – Draw</p>
