<p>The jackpot from the Powerball is expected to hit an estimated $672 million after no ticket guessed correctly all winning numbers from the drawing on Monday</p>
<p>After surviving Monday nightâ€™s drawing, the Powerball jackpot continues to grow. For the next drawing set for Wednesday, September 20, 2023, the jackpot soars to an estimate of $672 million. If a cash value option is selected, the jackpot would be an estimated $320.5 million.</p>
<p>The jackpot would become the 10th largest prize for the game considering the upcoming drawing. Moreover, the estimated $672 million jackpot would be the third-largest prize for 2023, surpassed only by the staggering $1.08 billion jackpot prize won on July 19 in California and the $754.6 million jackpot won on February 6 in Washington.</p>
<p>The drawing on Wednesday would mark the 27th run for the jackpot. As noted, previously the jackpot was won in California after a lucky ticket holder matched all five white balls and the red Powerball to secure a mouth-watering $1.08 billion prize. This marked the third-largest Powerball prize in the history of the game.</p>
<p>Currently, Powerball tickets are sold across the United States in 45 states, as well as Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia. The cost per ticket is $2 and drawings are scheduled for Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.</p>
<p>According to Powerball, the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. Still, there are plenty of lucky winners that can secure second or third-tier prizes. While those odds sound slim, the overall odds of winning a Powerball prize are 1 in 24.9.</p>
<p>The Latest Drawing Sees More than 900K Winning Tickets</p>
<p>No ticket was able to match all five white balls with numbers 2, 21, 26, 40, 42 and the red Powerball 9 from the most recent drawing on Monday. Yet, one lucky winner guessed correctly all white balls, securing a $1 million prize.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 17 people guessed four white numbers and the red Powerball number securing $50,000 each while three of them paid extra for Power Play, taking home $150,000 each. Lower-tier winners secured prizes between $300 and $4. Overall, there were more than 905,000 winning Powerball tickets around the country within the different prize tier levels.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, millions of players have already purchased their tickets in hopes of hitting the mouth-watering $672 million jackpot from the upcoming Powerball drawing. If the jackpot is hit, the lucky winner can either pick annual payments or a lump sum of approximately $320.5 million.</p>
