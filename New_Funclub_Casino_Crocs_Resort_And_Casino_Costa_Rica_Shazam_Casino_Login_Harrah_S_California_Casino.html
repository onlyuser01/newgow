    <h1>New Funclub Casino Crocs Resort And Casino Costa Rica Shazam Casino Login Harrah S California Casino</h1>

<p>So I'm not entirely sure what to do here. I "spun the prize wheel" one morning and won $9 in bonus funds. With a few lucky hits I met the 60x playthrough requirements and my bonus funds converted to cash, about $250 worth. I requested my bitcoin withdrawal, and it was approved and processed as usual. I've been a member there for a few years and have never had a problem before. I got the alert from my crypto wallet that $252 in bitcoin was on the way. I've never had any crypto transaction last more than a couple hours. But days went by and I was still waiting. So I looked deeper into the transaction and while it was sent to my address, the fee attached to it is so low that no miner will pick it up and confirm it. And most likely never will. It will eventually get purged from the mempool or canceled and returned to the sender. Based on what information I have been able to find. I've spent a lot of money there. And I deserve that money, bonus or no not. But idk what to do. The casino advises me to wait, indefinitely. They say it will get confirmed soon. But it won't. It's further away now than it ever has been. I will attach what information I have.</p>
