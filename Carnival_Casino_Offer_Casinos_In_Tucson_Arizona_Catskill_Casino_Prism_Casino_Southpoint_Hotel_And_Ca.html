    <h1>Carnival Casino Offer Casinos In Tucson Arizona Catskill Casino Prism Casino Southpoint Hotel And Ca</h1>

<p>Earlier this month, Lottomatica, an Italian gaming giant, announced its plans to acquire 100% of SKS365’s share capital. The deal, which values the latter business at €639 million ($702 million) was signed recently and, if cleared by all relevant regulators, is set to close in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>As a result of this major move, Lottomatia announced its plans to issue €500 million (approximately $549.1 million) in debt notes to fund the agreement. A first row of floating rate senior secured notes will be issued, followed by a second tranche of fixed rate senior secured notes. The latter notes will have a fixed rate of 7.125%. The move is also part of a €565 million 7.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 bond.</p>
<p>The division between the two bonds is yet to be announced and will likely be communicated once Lottomatica closes the deal or around the date of the completion.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Lottomatica has secured revolving credit cash borrowing of €50 million (roughly $55 million), under an existing revolving credit agreement.</p>
<p>The money Lottomatica secures through the notes and borrowings will allow it to fully fund the SKS365 purchase deal and cover all applicable fees and costs.</p>
<p>Lottomatica Is Looking Forward to Closing the Deal</p>
<p>Lottomatica will acquire SKS365 through its wholly-owned subsidiary CBO Spa. The successful deal comes in the wake of a failed takeover attempt by Playtech, which gave up on acquiring SKS365 recently. At the time, Flutter Entertainment was also rumored to be eyeing a takeover of SKS365’s business.</p>
<p>Guglielmo Angelozzi, Lottomatica’s chief executive officer, believes that the acquisition of SKS365 will provide CBO and Lottomatica with a major boost in Italy. As a company with over 1,000 shops and a significant online presence, SKS365 is an undeniably popular brand among local customers.</p>
<p>Angelozzi praised SKS365 as a top performer and lauded the efforts of its management team, which turned it into a local powerhouse.</p>
<p>Alexander Martin, SKS365’s CEO, also commented on the matter earlier, saying that his team is glad to join the Lottomatica family and believes that it could not have found a better acquisition partner.</p>
<p>For reference, SKS365 operates brands such as PlanetWin365 and PlanetPay365 in addition to running retail operations. Furthermore, the company has been decorated as one of Italy’s top employers for 2023.</p>
