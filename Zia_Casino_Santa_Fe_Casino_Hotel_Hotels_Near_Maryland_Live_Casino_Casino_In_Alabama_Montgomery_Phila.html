<p>MGM Resorts International has announced a plan to reopen the Mirage on August 27.</p>
<p>MGM Plans to Reopen the Mirage on August 27</p>
<p>The iconic resort the Mirage on the Las Vegas Strip will reopen on August 27, announced MGM Resorts International. The current plan leaves only two MGM properties which are yet to reopen their doors. Those properties are Park MGM on the Strip and the Empire Casino in New York. With that in mind, the company still hasn‚Äôt announced the reopening dates for those properties.</p>
<p>The reopening of the Mirage is just a week before the long Labor Day weekend. However, the resort which has more than 3,000 hotel rooms will reopen doors with slightly reduced amenities. For the moment, the resort‚Äôs showroom, which is a home of the classic Cirque du Soliel show will remain closed. Although the Mirage is now accepting reservations, visitors won‚Äôt be able to see the famous Volcano show as the amenity is listed as closed for the moment on the operator‚Äôs official web site.</p>

<p>‚ÄúReopening The Mirage allows us to bring many more of our employees back to work, which is critical in the recovery of our community,‚Äù said CEO Bill Hornbuckle in a statement. Hornbuckle outlined that MGM did a gradual and thoughtful reopening of its properties. This was necessary in order to implement the needed safety plans for all employees and guests, added Hornbuckle.</p>
<p>The Mirage Will Operate under MGM‚Äôs Seven Point Safety Plan</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the spread of COVID-19 forced casinos and many other ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù businesses to close. The Silver State was no exception. After more than 70 days of shutdown, the gaming venues in the state were allowed to reopen on June 4. But the operators who reopened doors had to follow strict post-COVID-19 health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>Back in May, MGM Resorts International issued a comprehensive report which outlined a list of health and safety protocols which the operator planned to implement when reopening its venues. The plan was later known as MGM‚Äôs ‚ÄúSeven-Point Safety Plan.‚Äù It featured reducing of the total capacity of each venue, mandatory wearing of masks as well as temperature screening.</p>
<p>Your health and safety are the center of all we do. We're ready to welcome you back to the experiences you love, curated with your safety in mind. Get #BacktoVegas, safely.</p>

<p>According to the plan, the operator introduced social distancing by installing plexiglass spacers. Hand sanitation stations were introduced as well as strict disinfection and enhanced cleaning protocols. As a part of the plan, MGM also introduced a number of contactless solutions such as digital menus and more. Now, in light of the reopening of the Mirage, the venue is going to follow the same plan, ensuring the safety of both visitors and guests.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Las Vegas, last week a report was released by the Convention and Visitors Authority. According to the report, the visitor number in Las Vegas in June declined with some 70.5%. But looking at data by the American Gaming Association (AGA) we find even more worrying results. According to recent data by AGA, Q2 2020 gambling revenue in the U.S. saw a 79% decline.</p>
