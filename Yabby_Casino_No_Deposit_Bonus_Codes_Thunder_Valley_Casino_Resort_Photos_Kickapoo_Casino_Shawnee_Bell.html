<p>DW Technologies, doing business as DigitalWin, the leading software developer and platform provider powering the sports betting and gaming sector, announced it forged a new partnership with Quick Custom Intelligence (QCI), the fast-growing provider of player development, marketing and gaming platforms that deliver efficiencies for the gaming and hospitality industry. Under the terms of the new agreement, QCI's leading solution for tribal and commercial casinos, as well as sports betting operators will be integrated into DigitalWin's platform, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the new collaboration seeks to boost DigitalWin's iGaming and sports betting platform, delivering real-time customer data and analytics capabilities that can help strengthen the operations of online and retail-based gambling operators. Thanks to the new collaboration, DigitalWin's partners will be able to access unique customer insights such as trends and habits in real time, allowing them to engage with players in unique ways.</p>
<p>Andrew Cardno, QCI's CTO, shared his excitement about the new collaboration: "We are proud to integrate a traditional and digital resort experience for Grand Royal Wôlinak Casino owned by the Abénakis de Wôlinak Tribe." Finally, he pointed out: "The work we are doing with DigitalWin will allow QCI to work with tribal nations to integrate their land-based and online casinos."</p>
<p>Michael Brooks, DigitalWin's Director of Product Development, added that the company is delighted to sign this agreement with QCI. He predicted that the collaboration will enable the company to gain access to unique customer activities such as habits and trends, and power the development of online and retail gambling operators.</p>
<p>Brooks said: "Data analytics, AI, and customer intelligence will be the driving force of the Casino of the Future and as customers continue to embrace the digital world, the online and offline business segments will become one expanded gaming universe." Finally, he explained: "We are excited to be at the forefront of that sea change, enabling our customers with the tools to compete in the decades to come."</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, QCI expanded the reach of its technology to three Live! Casino locations. Under the terms of that deal, the company boosted the reach of its QCI Enterprise Platform version 5.2 which was successfully deployed for three venues of The Cordish Companies.</p>
<p>As a result, venues in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Maryland were able to tap into QCI's innovative platform. The 5.2 version represents an upgraded version of QCI's award-winning platform that offers unique automation options and delivers management capabilities for gambling operators.</p>
