<p>Yggdrasil has released Mayan Waterfalls, its first slot with free spins, bonus wheels, and a buy bonus option from partner studio Thunderbolt Gaming</p>
<p>The leading publisher of iGaming content that focuses on offering “the best games, innovative mechanics, and engaging player experiences”, Yggdrasil, has released its latest YG Masters title, Mayan Waterfalls.</p>
<p>YG Masters is the studio’s content aggregation branch powered by a skilled community of developers intertwined with disruptive frameworks including the Game Adaptation Toolkit &amp; Interface (GATI) that offers fresh content recognized by global operators and well-renowned industry insiders.</p>
<p>The new 40-payline game with a max multiplier of x2,164 is the pioneering release from partner studio Thunderbolt Gaming. Other reputable YG Masters partners that have embraced the GATI solution are Northern Lights, 4 the Player, True Lab, and Avatar UX.</p>
<p>Here is everything you need to know about the fresh 4×3 slot released just a few days after the Badger Miners and Thunderhawk titles were added to Yggdrasil’s portfolio of slots.</p>

<p>Start Exploring the Ancient Mayan Temple</p>
<p>The action is set in an antique Mayan temple buried in the deep and lush jungle, designed with symbols that can trigger Wild waterfalls to suddenly emerge. Players need to start collecting orbs for the opportunity to spin the ancient wheel that can engage one of the two Free Spins games available.</p>
<p>As they continue to explore the temple, players are also likely to come across the iconic Moonlight Roulette that will help them scoop up a series of additional rewards.</p>
<p>Players who land orbs while engaged in the base game gradually fill up the four progressive boxes colored differently. When the bonus game is launched, the progress achieved by players will be used during the Ancient Wheel feature.</p>
<p>Players need a minimum of three bonus orb symbols to enter the Ancient Roulette Wheel that can further carry them in one of the two free spins stages. The first stage counts eight free spins that are played on special reels. The Waxing Moon symbol activates one of the four corners that make up the grid.</p>
<p>The second stage is activated once all four corners are engaged with the help of the Full Moon symbol that allows players to spin the Full Moon Wheel with extra free spins, wilds, and bet multipliers up to 20x available.</p>
<p>The waterfall symbol will trigger a waterfall to cover all the reels while changing into a wild.</p>
<p>Developing Mayan Waterfalls with Yggdrasil, a “Fantastic Milestone” for Thunderbolt Gaming</p>
<p>Thunderbolt Gaming’s head of games, Paul Malt, explained that creating the Mayan Waterfalls slot alongside Yggdrasil has represented a “fantastic milestone for us and we couldn’t be happier with the result.” Malt also expressed their excitement to be able to join Yggdrasil’s massive content distribution network which should help them rapidly reach players in critical markets worldwide.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s chief gaming operator, Mark McGinley, called it “fantastic” for Thunderbolt Gaming to release its first-ever game as a YG Masters partner while describing the title as an excellent way of introducing the studio to their players and operator partners.</p>
<p>McGinley also called the new releases a “fantastic addition” to their successful YG Masters portfolio thanks to its bonus features, in-game progression, and one-of-a-kind graphics.</p>
<p>In February, Yggdrasil was rewarded with the Innovator of the Year Award during the International Gaming Awards 2023.</p>
