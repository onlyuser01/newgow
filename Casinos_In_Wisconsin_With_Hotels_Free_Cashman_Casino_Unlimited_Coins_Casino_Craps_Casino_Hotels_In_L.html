<p>100 Joker Staxx review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The makers of 40 Joker Staxx clearly took the position that more is better when they came up with the idea for a sequel, because 100 Joker Staxx has 250% the number of win lines as its predecessor, but not a lot else has changed.</p>
<p>The visuals still focus on the red and gold colour scheme of the jester’s uniform, but the rest of the slot is based on fruit machines, with cherries and oranges on every reel.</p>
<p>It is not the most creative of themes, nor was much creativity brought to bear on the design.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>This lack of creativity is pretty typical for Playson slot machines. 100 Joker Staxx is drawn well, with clear symbols and high-def rendering of its animations and logos, but it is all so much lipstick on a pig.</p>
<p>The fundamental design lacks any charm to engage the player or a theme to mark the slot out against its competition.</p>
<p>There is no attempt to create a soundtrack, instead the only noises are a series of sound effects for the reels and winnings that are astonishing in their blandness.</p>
<p>Win in the 100 Joker Staxx slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>100 Joker Staxx is a five reel slot machine, with four rows and one hundred win lines.</p>
<p>There are no bonus games or gamble features to add some variation to the monotonous gameplay. The only concession to variety is that some of the symbols are stacked.</p>
<p>Despite being devoid of features, 100 Joker Staxx does not evoke the minimalist simplicity that some other feature-free slot machines offer.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. Wilds are stacked on the reels.</p>
<p>The Scatter pays out regardless of where on the reels it lands. You just need to hit three or more in one spin, with three Scatters paying out four times your total bet per spin, four paying out twenty times your bet, and five paying out two hundred times your bet per spin.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high. This is the one small bit of good news as it means the slot could pair well with our slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>However, the return to player of this game is not provided by the publisher. When the return to player for a slot is not clearly provided in the game documentation, we take this as a red flag as it could be masking an exorbitant vig.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Paytable for 100 Joker Staxx slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With little character or charm and no published return to player or bonus features 100 Joker Staxx is not winning any prizes from us.</p>
<p>We would strongly recommend you look elsewhere for your next slot machine.</p>
