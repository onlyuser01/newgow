<p>Chat Transcript</p>
<p>I was playing the game Hidden Valley about two weeks ago and the game froze part way through a free spins round...i contacted the chat room and your staff logged in with my details and could not get it to reload. i was told the problem was being forwarded to the game provider and I had to wait for a response. After a couple of days I could access the game but the free spins round had gone - as had my accumulted winnings up to the game crashing. I feel I have now waited lkong enough and would like to know what will be done tody.</p>
<p>Joan</p>
<p>We got feedback from our technical department and they didn't manage to fix the issue. The only thing that we can do at the moment is to offer you a free bonus as compensation.</p>
<p>Alistair John Kenworthy</p>
<p>no - i do not want a bonus with wagering requirmenets - i would like a return of the winings accumulated up to the game crashing - and extra for the 5 remaining spins</p>
<p>Joan</p>
<p>If you want to send a complain again, we suggest you to do that by sending an e-mail to suppot@4crownscasino.com</p>
<p>2:13:29 PM</p>
<p>Alistair John Kenworthy</p>
<p>nope - i do not wish to complain either - i require a return of my funds. Now - the choices are very few - either my funds are returned or I would like this account closed and I will then spend the next few days posting on all casino sites the ansswer given by yourselves</p>
<p>2:14:52 PM</p>
<p>Joan</p>
<p>In order to close your account, you have to send your request to vip@4crownscasino.com because I cannot close your account since you are VIP player.</p>
<p>Joan</p>
<p>As I told you, the only thing we can do is offer you a free bonus, since you do not want to accept it there is nothing left for me to do than to refer you to the VIP.</p>
<p>2:17:33 PM</p>
<p>Alistair John Kenworthy</p>
<p>what I want is my money that is owed</p>
<p>Joan</p>
<p>If you want your money back you have to send a request to support@4crownscasino.com</p>
<p>Joan</p>
