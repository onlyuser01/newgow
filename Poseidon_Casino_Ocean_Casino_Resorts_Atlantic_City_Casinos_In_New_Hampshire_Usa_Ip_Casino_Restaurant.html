    <h1>Poseidon Casino Ocean Casino Resorts Atlantic City Casinos In New Hampshire Usa Ip Casino Restaurant</h1>

<p>Hi Viliam,</p>
<p>it was the game Bonanza. Perhaps 60 to 80 times had the game stopped, 2-3 times was but no win, then, as it seeemed to be good stopped promptly. I think, I had played another game for a few minutes, it was the same. Then Bonanza again.</p>
<p>I know, it was stupid that I have seen lately that something was wrong.</p>
<p>But I'm sure that this strange thing can not be explained with technical issues or random.</p>
<p>No technical issue could choice which spin will be ended or not. Am I right?</p>
<p>And such a random, which lets only some spins to end, does not exist.</p>
<p>At the end I have contacted the chat and the chat has promptly said that there is a problem which concerns many players.</p>
<p>I am sorry that I have not ordered a copy of the first chat.</p>
<p>The second, third, fourth chats of which I have sent you the copies, show that the chat supporters have confirmed the problem.</p>
<p>And with the fifth chat the casino has denied everything.</p>
<p>It is really impertinent, that the casino tries to make the chat supporters guilty for informations which they can not find themselves.</p>
