<p>Genius Sports Limited, a leading provider of official data, technology, and broadcast options, has agreed to partner up with the Australian A-Leagues, covering both the UTE A-League Men (ALM) and the Liberty A-league Women (ALW) as the Official Data Partner for the current 2022/2023 competitive season. The company’s status as an official data partner is part of a bigger-picture collaboration with the Australian Professional Leagues in the first place.</p>
<p>The idea behind the partnership is to significantly boost the integrity of football in Australia. Genius Sports will deploy its advanced algorithms and monitoring technology to provide A-Leagues with 24/7 monitoring, along with the educational tools necessary to ensure that athletes, teams, staff, and consumers remain safe and aware of malicious practices within the sport.</p>
<p>Genius Sports will bring "crucial" visibility into the A-Leagues and make it possible for regulatory bodies and the league to immediately flag suspicious betting activities that are connected with the competitions in any way. Commenting on this opportunity, APL Director of Strategy and Digital Michael Tange said:</p>
<p>"Genius are global leaders in data and integrity services, and we are delighted to be building this partnership with them."</p>
<p>The data provided by Genius Sports will further assist the Australian Professional Leagues to turn the sport and competitions they host into a far more entertaining athletic event. Meanwhile, Genius Sports Head of Australasia and Sportstech John Curzon was equally excited with the upcoming partnership. He noted that football in Australia is already building a strong momentum and has been expanding for years now.</p>
<p>"We’re thrilled to be partnering with the A-Leagues at this critical stage of its global expansion, connecting Australian football with millions of fans around the world as their exclusive official data partner," the executive stated in the official press release.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Genius Sports remains the official and often exclusive data rights partner for a number of competitions around the world, including the A-Leagues as of now. Other sports bodies and organizations Genius Sports has similar arrangements with include the National Football League in the United States and the Premier League in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Genius Sports recently released a brand new In-Play MultiBet product dedicated to making sports betting and sports more entertaining. Genius Sports launched a series of ambitious partnerships in North America, including one with MaximBet designed to help the brand spearhead its growth in the region in a sustainable way. Not least, Genius Sports partnered up with NorthStar Gaming for Ontario, Canada.</p>
