<p>Kambi Group, a leading provider of sports betting solutions for some of the world’s premier operators, has entered into a new partnership with Bally’s Corporation, a US-based gaming giant. The companies will now work to support and assist the latter’s sports betting brand, Bally Bet, to benefit from an end-to-end solution for its operations.</p>
<p>Kambi Group will play an important role in Bally Bet’s future success with the company focusing on expanding Bally’s reach and assisting the brand’s online and retail sportsbook to deliver a better experience. This will be facilitated through Kambi’s own managed sportsbooksystems and solutions.</p>
<p>Kambi brings an array of products that can be integrated quickly and reliably into a company’s offer, including marketingtechnology stacks, compliance technology, advertising capabilities, and so much more. Kambi will also be replacing the current sports betting technology which is Bally’s own doing. The supplier will still benefit from Bally’s comprehensive in-house data.</p>
<p>Kambi and Bally’s Corporation are also negotiating a potential expansion of the partnership that would allow Bally to acquire a limited licensure of the Kambi betting platform providing that specific market performance benchmarks are achieved, the companies shared in the press release. This will grant Bally limited access to Kambi’s online and retail tech source code.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Kristian Nylén, Kambi’s Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, welcomed the opportunity to see his company’s software once again arrive at a prominent operator and brand. He said that Kambi was looking to have a long-term collaboration with Bally Bet and added:</p>
<p>"Kambi is the proven global leader in sportsbook provision, and I believe this powerful collaboration with Bally's will deliver its customers the next-generation betting entertainment they demand."</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation Chief Executive Officer, Robeson Reeves, was similarly pleased with this new opportunity to bring the two companies closer together through the provision of advanced sportsbook software and solutions to help spearhead the product.</p>
<p>Reeves welcomed the opportunity to be entering into a partnership with Kambi, one of the most trusted gaming technology companies out there. The deal between Kambi and Bally's Corporation was also supplemented by a separate similar agreement with White Hat Gaming, which will specifically provide the Player Account management systems for Bally Bet.</p>
<p>"Kambi provides an award-winning sportsbook that delivers unrivalled sports betting entertainment. By incorporating that with White Hat’s PAM platform solution, as well as our geographic reach, customer base, and marketing prowess, Bally’s will be optimally positioned to achieve significant scale and capture substantial market share in the global gaming market," the executive said giving a full vote of confidence to the company’s new partner.</p>
<p>The latest partnerships for Kambi Group comes on the back of a very successful first quarter which had a number of highlights. The partnership with Bally’s Corporation will definitely be reflected in the next earnings call.</p>
