<p>The lucky guest at Excalibur in Las Vegas, whose name was not revealed, secured the $12.1 million jackpot from the Megabucks Spitfire Multipliers Triple Red Hot 7s</p>
<p>Every gambler’s dream is to win the jackpot. But winning a multi-million-dollar prize is something else. This is precisely the case of one lucky Las Vegas visitor who secured more than $12 million from a Megabucks slots machine. The lucky player secured the second-largest Megabucks win in Nevada on Megabucks Spitfire Multipliers Triple Red Hot 7s, the Las Vegas Review-Journal confirmed, citing a spokesperson from IGT Gaming.</p>
<p>The staggering $12,185,766 jackpot prize dropped at Excalibur in Las Vegas on Wednesday last week. The latest prize represented the third jackpot for Las Vegas Valley this year. Moreover, it was the fourth grand prize dropping from a Megabucks slots machine since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>The name of the lucky visitor who pocketed the $12 million jackpot prize was not disclosed. The venue also hasn’t confirmed what the lucky winner intends to do with the hefty sum. Whatever the case, considering the size of the prize, they have plenty of available options, from round-the-world trips to luxury cars, real estate or investment.</p>
<p>Recently, during a jackpot-winning spree earlier this month, several Las Vegas visitors won $1 million in jackpots for a single week. The winning spree saw different people secure five and six-digit prizes with the largest being a $372,890 win from the Ultimate Texas Hold’em poker at O’Sheas Irish Pub located inside The LINQ Hotel+ Experience. The prize was secured by a lucky visitor from California who hit the game’s Mega Progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>More Jackpot Prizes Drop in Sin City</p>
<p>After the recent Megabucks jackpot at the Excalibur, another Las Vegas guest secured a nice jackpot after visiting Binion’s Gambling Hall &amp; Hotel. On Monday, a visitor identified as Karolyne was able to turn a $0.75 bet into the staggering $11,346.73 while playing the Buffalo Gold Revolution penny progressive. This marked the latest huge win for the popular slot game.</p>
<p>Before that, one visitor of the Cannery Casino in Las Vegas also hit a mouth-watering jackpot. On Sunday, the venue confirmed that a visitor hit the Dragon Link jackpot, taking home some $14,734.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a lottery player turned $5 into a massive $2.4 million win from the Florida Lottery’s $150,000 A YEAR FOR LIFE scratch-off game. The 49-year-old winner from Dothan, Alabama, had the option to select $150,000 in annual payments for life. However, he decided to take advantage of a lump sum, pocketing some $2,440,000.00. With more prizes up for grabs from the Lottery’s $150,000 A YEAR FOR LIFE scratch-off, chances of winning a prize are 1 in 3.95.</p>
