<p>Thanks to the Swedish game software license the company can continue to expand its presence in the country</p>
<p>The renowned provider of iGaming and sportsbook software and content, Altenar, announced it expanded its presence on the Old Continent after securing an important license. The company confirmed on Monday that it has been granted a business-to-business (B2B) license from the gambling regulator in Sweden, the Swedish Gambling Authority or Spelinspektionen.</p>
<p>Securing the B2B license marks an important achievement for Altenar as it enables the company to continue to grow its presence by delivering its services to operators within the regulated gambling market in the country. The strategic license comes in anticipation of planned changes to the market in the country that would require providers of iGaming and betting technology, such as Altenar, to have a B2B license.</p>
<p>The new B2B license in Sweden comes during a busy period for the company. Over the last year, Altenar was recognized with prestigious awards from the Baltic and Scandinavian Gaming Awards, SBC Latin America and MiGEAs, among other prestigious events for the iGaming and betting vertical. The recent license also resonates well with the company’s ongoing global expansion. By now, Altenar has licenses in 13 major gambling markets around the globe, including licenses from the MGA and the UKGC.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Expand Its Presence</p>
<p>Marina Zacharopoulou, Altenar’s technical compliance manager, explained that to secure the license in Sweden, the company has gone through an extensive evaluation process. The result of the process reaffirmed the company’s commitment to ensuring the highest standards for security and quality, while at the same time supporting responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Zacharopoulou, added that Altenar is proud to secure this license which clears the path for the company’s further expansion in the country. “Altenar remains dedicated to maintaining its reputation as a trusted and reliable provider of gaming software,” said the company’s technical compliance manager in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We have undergone a rigorous evaluation process and have demonstrated our commitment to upholding the highest standards of quality, security, and responsible gaming.“ Marina Zacharopoulou, technical compliance manager at Altenar</p>
<p>The B2B license in Sweden comes after earlier this month, the company announced an important partnership with Palms Bet, expanding further its footprint into the Bulgarian gambling market. The collaboration represented an important milestone for the two companies, allowing them to continue growing their presence in the country.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the license in Sweden also complements Altenar’s growth, considering the potential of the market in the country. Without any doubt, the country is one of the important betting jurisdictions in Europe, considering that in 2022, betting gross gaming revenue in Sweden increased by 7% year-over-year.</p>
