<p>Flutter Entertainment has sealed another year where the company’s impact on charitable causes and initiatives across the United Kingdom and Ireland was pronounced. The group donated a total of £8m to local initiatives.</p>
<p>The donations have been forwarded by the group’s flagship brands, to wit Betfair, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, and Paddy Power, and the charitable efforts align with Flutter’s commitment to the Do More campaign which incentivizes businesses to invest more in their local communities.</p>
<p>Flutter CEO Ian Brown has welcomed the opportunity to see his company’s UK &amp; Ireland division "Do More" for local communities and under the group’s largest ambitions for sustainable communities. Brown added:</p>
<p>"Our market-leading brands have each launched creative and impactful campaigns that directly support the causes that are close to our customers and our colleagues. Across Flutter, we hold ourselves to the highest standards in the industry, and we are passionate about making a lasting positive impact."</p>
<p>The charitable contributions are also part of the Positive Impact Plan, which is part of the broader efforts within the company to establish a more sustainable future. There have been various initiatives undertaken by the group’s brands over the past months which focus on investing in communities. Paddy Power announced that it would donate £1m to Prostate Cancer UK, which is tied to the operator’s current sponsorship of the 2023 PDC World Darts Championship.</p>
<p>Another £1m donation was made to Prostate Cancer UK. Betfair has contributed to various initiatives. The operator launched the Serial Winners Fund which is designed to support the Injured Jockeys Fund and the Irish Injured Jockeys. Sky Bet launched one of the biggest donations to date, with a £6 million Building Foundations Fund which was established with the help of the English Football League.</p>
<p>The fund is exclusively designated to help support local communities and award grants of up to £100,000 to support targeted and localized projects spearheaded by EFL’s 72 clubs. Flutter has recently had to revise its full-year adjusted EBITDA and lowered its expectations, but this has not stopped the group from investing further into charitable activities.</p>
<p>The company is also now looking at increased competition in the North American market where its flagship brand, FanDuel has to fend off competitors such as ESPN Bet and Fanatics which are breaking through the front entrance of regulated gambling in the United States.</p>
