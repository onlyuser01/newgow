<p>UGA 2021 and the Legal Context</p>
<p>Ukraine made headlines earlier this year after it announced that the government is pushing ahead with plans to legalize gambling in the country. On August 11, after several months of debates, Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, signed Bill 2285-d into law and set in motion the legalization of the industry.</p>
<p>The new law was enacted on August 13, and it has been subject to a few revisions to allow Ukraine to speed up the adoption process and make it easier for brands to enter into operation. The country has appointed executives for its new Gambling Commission in November, and the country is now on the tip of expanding.</p>
<p>UGW 2021 will capture the country’s first steps into legitimate gambling with a strong focus on the future where the world’s leading brands come to the country to offer a benchmark-standard product to consumers in the country.</p>
