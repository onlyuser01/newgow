<p>Croatia’s Suffered Just One Loss in the Last 12 Months</p>
<p>Even though it’s home to under 4 million people, Croatia is a real soccer powerhouse. The winners of the third place at the World Cup in Qatar now stand a chance to win their first major trophy – the 2023 Nations League. For that to happen, however, “The Checkered Ones” need to beat Spain on June 18.</p>
<p>What’s giving Croatia’s fans confidence is that Zlatko Dalic’s boys have been in brilliant form. It’s not a recent form – these guys have been sensational for a long time. Actually, they’ve suffered only one loss in the last 12 months, counting all competitions and friendlies.</p>

<p>2023 #NationsLeague final?</p>
<p>Croatia have only lost one of their past 16 fixtures – that semi-final defeat to eventual world champions Argentina.#NEDCRO pic.twitter.com/4ud9ZePags — Sacha Pisani (@Sachk0) June 14, 2023</p>
<p>The loss in question happened in the semifinal of the World Cup. They lost 3-0 to Argentina, who then went on to win the trophy. It sounds like a blowout loss, but it’s Croatia that actually had the ball in its possession for most of the time. Messi &amp; Co. were just more lethal than them.</p>
<p>With their captain Luka Modric having his “last dance” in the checkered jersey, we could see these guys have great ball possession on June 18. With him, as well as with Marcelo Brozovic, Mateo Kovacic, and Mario Pasalic, they could put on a real fight against Spain in the center of the pitch. The trouble is that midfield is Spain’s arguably strongest point.</p>
<p>Nations League Odds Suggest “La Furia Roja” Will Win</p>
<p>Spain is a team that likes keeping the ball in its possession, creating a lot of goal chances along the way. Against Italy in the semifinal of the Nations League, we saw them create 19 goal attempts. In comparison, the Italians made only eight.</p>
<p>Spain’s midfield is great, but these guys are not too sharp in the offense, which explains why they made only two of their 19 chances count against Italy. Further, their defense can be leaky sometimes. The reason is simple – in 2023, “La Furia Roja” doesn’t have great defenders.</p>
<p>Sure, Aymeric Laporte is one of the best center-backs on the planet, but he hasn’t been a starter for his team (Manchester City) in recent times. Further, his partner in the center of the defensive line, Robin Le Normand, just doesn’t have enough experience with big games such as the 2023 UEFA Nations Final.</p>
<p>On top of everything, Spain’s full-backs – Jordi Alba and Jesus Navas – are approaching the twilight of their career. Alba is 34, while Navas is turning 38 in a few months’ time.</p>
<p>Croatia vs. Spain Nations League Final 2023 Prediction</p>
<p>Our 2023 UEFA Nations League prediction is that Croatia will win the trophy. They might not do it in the regular 90 minutes, but these guys definitely have the talent and the experience needed to come on top in the end.</p>
<p>Pick: Croatia to win the 2023 Nations League</p>
