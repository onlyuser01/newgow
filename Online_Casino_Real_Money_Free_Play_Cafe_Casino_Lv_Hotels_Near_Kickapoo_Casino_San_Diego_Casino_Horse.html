<p>Casimba Gaming, a prominent iGaming operator, has added more content with the company tying a new alliance with BGaming. The partnership is designed to significantly strengthen the available titles that Casimba’s B2C casino brands can access.</p>
<p>The partnership will lead to 100 titles being added to Casimba Gaming’s library, with titles such as Limbo Y and Gemhalla among the titles to join the content library, leading to even more worthwhile experiences.</p>
<p>BGaming Head of Sales Olga Levshina has hailed the opportunity to see the supplier’s content portfolio roll out with yet another prominent iGaming client. "We are confident that this partnership will strengthen our presence in major markets, including Europe and Canada, as the provider continues its growth trajectory," Levshina said.</p>
<p>Casimba Gaming Director of B2B Lavina Karlsson was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that BGaming was nothing if not an esteemed developer of hard-hitting and player-favorite content. As such, BGaming deploys some of the most innovative content ad titles to target audiences.</p>
<p>Karlsson hailed BGaming’s development of its portfolio, which includes fresh concepts such as mobile and crypto-casino-themed games, which is why Casimba is confident that this partnership is future-proof and built to continually deliver on excellent experience for the company’s aggregation service.</p>
<p>BGaming has been growing its international footprint at a solid clip. The company has expanded in Latin America and Asia, as it has been seeking to strike home with new audiences for its 100-game strong portfolio. Besides this, BGaming has also been moving hard on European markets.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the supplier obtained a BMM Testlabs certification, allowing it to break ground into the Spanish iGaming market, marking yet another successful milestone completed for the company. Apart from these milestones, BGaming has been a robust portfolio of titles.</p>
<p>The company has plenty of new releases in the pipework, including Wild Cash Dice, ManekiFortunes, Bone Bonanza, and more. The content’s schedule has been filled with fresh releases which will add to the quality of the product that Casimba Games will now be serving to its players moving forward.</p>
