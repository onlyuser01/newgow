    <h1>Platinum Reels Casino Dells Casino St Louis Casino Hotel Casino Bethlehem Pa Lotsa Slots Casino Game</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm having issues with the turnover at CBet. I initially made a deposit of 8000 ARS for entertainment and usually play on roulette. When I was able to turn those 8000 ARS into 24000 ARS, I tried to withdraw it to see how the system works. I noticed that I was still short of about 17000 ARS to make the withdrawal. I continued playing roulette, and my total went from 24000 ARS to 48000 ARS after going all-in. The amount needed for withdrawal increased from 17000 ARS to approximately 54000 ARS. I contacted support to ask why the amount had increased and they told me it was due to their turnover rules. After reading the rules, they indicated that the amount would decrease if I played X number of times, regardless of the risk.</p>
<p>I then decided to risk it all to lower the total (bad luck if I lost) and the turnover increased more than double what I won (around 200000 ARS).</p>
<p>I have attached screenshots showing the turnover increasing.</p>
<p>I also include a video of my 150k ARS all-in, where the turnover was at 273k ARS, and after winning, went up to 723k ARS.</p>
<p>I have been in contact with support and after some effort, I was able to get a ticket issued. They say I will get a response within 72 business hours. However, I never received any email confirming the creation of the ticket. Moreover, I can't access the technical support chat, which is supposedly available 24/7.</p>
<p>I would also like to mention that my initial deposit was 8000 ARS without the use of any bonus. Therefore, I don't understand why the turnover keeps increasing when I use roulette.</p>
<p>I'm attaching a screenshot of the only deposit I made.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would attach the conversation I had with technical support but I can't access it as it's disabled in my case.</p>
<p>I hope this complaint can at least resolve my problem or helped others be aware of CBet's unfair practices. Many others have fallen into this "scam" of turnover requirements.</p>
<p>I'm including a screenshot of some individuals complaining on the CBet chat about not being able to withdraw their funds due to the same issue.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response,</p>
