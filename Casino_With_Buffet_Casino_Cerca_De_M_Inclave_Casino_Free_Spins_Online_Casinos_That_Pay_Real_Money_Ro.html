    <h1>Casino With Buffet Casino Cerca De M Inclave Casino Free Spins Online Casinos That Pay Real Money Ro</h1>

<p>Hello henrydbombtraxx</p>
<p>I'm Michal and I have taken over your complaint. I have reviewed your case and I have received evidence from the casino that you gained your winnings while the bonus was still active.</p>
<p>Let me try to explain it.</p>
<p>You were given $105 to try the site with a coupon code (105LOKO). You ended up winning over $3000. You requested a withdrawal of $2000 and it was denied. The support said you could only withdraw $105. You have not withdrawn the $105 so technically the bonus with the max cashout limit of 105$ was still active. You did deposit another $50, but the bonus terms and conditions still apply as mentioned here:</p>
<p>RULES</p>
<p>NO DEPOSIT BONUSES (FREE CHIPS, FREE SPINS)</p>
<ol>
<li>While mixing deposits and a free bonus is not allowed, we are aware that this may happen from time to time. If, for whatever reason, you make a deposit while using a No Deposit Bonus (e.g. Free Chip, Free Spins offer, etc.), the wagering requirements and maximum allowed cash out of the No Deposit Bonus will still apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information, we have to agree with the casino's decision in this case. I can only recommend that you read the bonus T&amp;Cs thoroughly before you activate any bonuses to avoid disappointments like this in the future.</p>
<p>For the other part of your complaint regarding the payout times. This is again really hard to judge. I understand your point and agree with you that the casino should stick to its advertised time scale, however, please bear in mind that it’s quite usual for withdrawals to take a couple of days or even weeks to get fully processed. Several factors such as the Licensing Authority, geolocation, contracts with the payment providers, and bank restrictions, all have a major influence. If a payment method was available for deposits, it doesn’t mean necessarily, that it will be offered for withdrawals too, also it can be discontinued at any time. Unfortunately, casinos are sometimes powerless and limited in offering payment methods to their customers. With this in mind, we can't consider this as something unfair as even the best casinos in the industry can't 100% guarantee that players are paid within minutes.</p>
<p>I understand this isn't a satisfactory solution to your issue, but after gathering all the necessary information we don't think any further investigation is needed and we are forced to reject your complaint. If there is something I have overlooked or if you might have other information that will shed a different light on this case, please feel free to share them. Otherwise, we are forced to reject your complaint.</p>
