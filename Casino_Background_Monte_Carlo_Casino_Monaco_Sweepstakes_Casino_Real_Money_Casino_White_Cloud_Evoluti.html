<p>The independent, grant-making charity focused on gambling treatment and prevention services in the UK, GambleAware, announced the launch of bids for evaluation and learning partners for its Aftercare Funding Programme (AFP).</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest Can Be Submitted through October 28</p>
<p>The expressions of interest for the evaluation and learning partners as a part of the AFP launched Wednesday, October 5, 2022. Interested parties will have until Friday, October 28, 2022, at 5 PM to submit their proposals for the work. This part of the AFP project is expected to start next year in February and run through 2026.</p>
<p>“The GambleAware Evaluation team is seeking Expressions of Interest for evaluation and learning partners for the Aftercare Funding Programme.“ GambleAware</p>
<p>According to GambleAware, the maximum budget available for the evaluation and learning partners is £300,000 ($340,600). Additionally, the charity explained that the work within the program “seeks to fund post-care (aftercare) initiatives to enable people to maintain their recovery from gambling harms.” The charity explained that maintaining the recovery of people affected by gambling harm is a new area that hasn’t seen much investment in the UK previously. Still, GambleAware acknowledged that the ultimate goal for the AFP is to ensure people affected by gambling harm complete a “sustained recovery.”</p>
<p>The Charity Seeks Evaluation and Learning Partners</p>
<p>An evaluation partner as a part of GambleAware’s program is expected to monitor the impact and evaluate the processes as a part of the AFP. In other words, the charity explained that one of the goals of the evaluation partner would be to learn “what works, for whom and in what circumstances.” Moreover, the evaluation partner will help identify successful approaches with particular communities and track motivation and engagement possibilities that can help gambling harm recovery treatment in the future.</p>
<p>“An evaluation partner for the programme, to carry out an overall impact and process evaluation of the programme and fund as a whole, and ensure learning and emerging insights are fed back to key stakeholders at GambleAware,“ explained the charity</p>
<p>On the other hand, the learning partner will collaborate with the projects within the program with a goal to indicate what change is expected and how the partners of the program expect to achieve those changes. Ultimately, the learning partner is expected to help with the exchange of knowledge, know-how and learning within the different projects. In turn, this will bridge the gap between the involved projects and ensure knowledge and insight are distributed while at the same time helping overcome different challenges.</p>
