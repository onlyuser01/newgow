    <h1>New Usa Online Casinos 2023 Real Money Sweetwater Casino Casino Royale Casinos In Vermont Richmond G</h1>

<p>Following extensive field tests, IGT’s PlaySports platform has received Nevada’s regulatory approval, giving the technology supplier an edge in providing innovative solutions to the sports betting industry.</p>
<p>IGT Is Expanding in Nevada through the PlaySports Platform</p>
<p>International Game Technology (IGT), a technology supplier based in London, has begun the expansion of its sports betting operations in the US market and in the well-established gambling hub of Nevada in particular. The company will use its PlaySports platform, which is already live in 16 states.</p>
<p>In order to receive regulatory approval in Nevada, there is an obligatory field trial process that new technological solutions have to go through before receiving a nod from regulators. IGT started this trial in August 2020 at Boyd Gaming properties. Now the betting solutions provider’s PlaySports platform is powering Boyd Gaming’s venues in the state.</p>
<p>IGT’s PlaySports platform has seen almost two billion wagers worldwide go through its system since its introduction more than ten years ago. The provider powers betting operators in Asia, Latin America, and Europe with the likes of Lottomatica and OPAP on its customer list.</p>
<p>Regulatory Approval in Nevada Will Help IGT Get Ahead of the Competition</p>
<p>IGT PlayDigital senior vice president Enrico Drago commented on the milestone, saying that approval for the PlaySports solution will help the company offer sports betting expertise to long-term customers in the state and that hopefully, it would assist in making IGT stand out from other B2B providers.</p>
<p>Drago pointed out the PlaySports platform is powered by a high-efficiency betting engine that provides players with an outstanding experience along with an embedded Player Account Management component that gives operators the chance to gain new customers and keep them through tailored discounts and offers. In addition, PlaySports’ transposable design features make it possible for betting operators’ expand into new markets.</p>
<p>IGT Named Principal iGaming Content Supplier by FanDuel</p>
<p>Last year in August, IGT struck a deal with FanDuel Group as well. Under a multi-year agreement, the company became FanDuel’s exclusive retail platform provider for the whole US market. Additionally, FanDuel also named IGT a leading iGaming content supplier.</p>
<p>In January 2021, FanDuel also launched their sports betting app in Virginia, powered by IGT’s PlaySports platform. Regardless of the company’s successful recent partnerships, 2020’s unprecedented turn of events has left its mark on IGT’s financial performance, as outlined in the company’s financial report released today.</p>
