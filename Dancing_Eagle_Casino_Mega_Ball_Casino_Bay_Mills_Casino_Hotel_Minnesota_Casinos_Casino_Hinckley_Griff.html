    <h1>Dancing Eagle Casino Mega Ball Casino Bay Mills Casino Hotel Minnesota Casinos Casino Hinckley Griff</h1>

<p>I requested self-exclusion from the Karamba group of casinos, which Griffon belongs to, on April 15th, 2021. I sent the email to care@karamba.com, which is a fully functional and correct email address used by the group for communication. Therefore there is no mistaking that the email has been received.</p>
<p>Therefore it is really dubious that I have been able to open an account and deposit roughly 8,900 euros to Griffon Casino after said date. All of the details given upon registration match those stated in the email. The casino closed my account later but reopened it as per request in june 2022 even though they were fully aware of my gambling problem. I had told the chat in june 2022 that I have no problem with gambling, as an addict would do to get their fix, but seeing as all of the deposits I am asking a refund for were made before this period, it does not count as an excuse, and the casino definitely shouldn’t have let me play in the first place. Bare in mind that this casino group excludes from ALL OF IT’S CASINOS if you request exclusion from one. Therefore I should not have been able to play in Griffon in the firstt place.</p>
<p>They have later refused my refund stating that no email was received. I have asked Karamba to confirm that they received the email but they keep ignoring me. I also have asked Griffon Casino’s support to email me chat transcripts. They have the correct address and claim to have emailed me four times but no emails were ever received - nor in my mailbox or spam. That means they are blatantly lying and covering their tracks.</p>
<p>I beg you for help. I have attached proof in this message.</p>
