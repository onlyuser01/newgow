    <h1>Skyriver Casino Hollywood Casino Rv Park Casino In Tucson Az Bronco Billys Casino Battle Creek Casin</h1>

<p>More than a month since the beginning of private gambling in Ontario, Canada, the number of companies that are looking to join the highly-regulated and attractive market has not diminished. If anything, encouraged by the success of others, companies are now queuing up to launch their own operations. Last week it was DraftKings, but this week, the new licensee signups begin with 1x2 Network.</p>
<p>The supplier is happy to join the market in Ontario and introduce the 1x2gaming and Iron Dog Studios brands which will become available to interested companies which are looking to bolster their local operations and add more quality content to them. This will mean a number of games developed by the skilled 1x2 Network hands, including titles such as Phoenix Inferno, Strike, Battle Maidens, and Blazing 777s.</p>
<p>This is not the first entry for 1x2 Network in the coveted Canadian market. In fact, the company has already been able to establish a license agreement with Loto-Quebec. Commenting on this opportunity in a press release to the media, 1x2 Network account management and marketing director Rory Kimber said:</p>
<p>"Ontario promises to be one of the largest online casino markets in North America, so it made absolute sense for 1X2 Network as a leading provider of premium slot and table game content to enter the province."</p>
<p>Kimber cited his company’s former experience with delivering reliable and trustworthy products that are making their way through Canada with the help of Loto-Québec. He confirmed that 1x2 Network expects the company’s content to perform just as well in Ontario as anywhere else.</p>
<p>1x2 Network already has licenses in multiple jurisdictions including Sweden, Spain, Romania, and Greece. Other places where it operates include Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Malta, and the United Kingdom. 1x2 Network’s predominantly European reach though has now been bolstered by its newly-minted operations in Canada which are expected to pay off, the company argues.</p>
