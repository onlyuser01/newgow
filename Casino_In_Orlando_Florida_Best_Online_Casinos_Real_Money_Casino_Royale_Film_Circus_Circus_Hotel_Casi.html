<p>SOFTSWISS Managed Services announced its Anti-Fraud Team completed a training course by the leading provider of information, advice and support for people affected by gambling-related issues, GamCare. The announcement came Friday and sees the Anti-Fraud Team boost its social responsibility efforts.</p>
<p>The course called "Social Responsibility, Communication and Motivating Behavior Change" ultimately seeks to train the Anti-Fraud Team to be more proactive when dealing with gambling-related harm. Moreover, according to SOFTSWISS Managed services, the recent certification "highlights the team’s commitment to work in line with the principles of social responsibility."</p>
<p>By completing the certification, the Anti-Fraud Team can now resolve more complex challenges related to gambling harm. VIP managers, responsible gambling specialists as well as shift leads all participated in the recent training.</p>
<p>Anastasia Vyshinskaia, SOFTSWISS Managed Services' Head, shared her excitement in a statement released on August 19, 2022. She outlined that the company's team remains focused on improving their knowledge and consequently leveraging it.</p>
<p>According to her: "The course by GamCare is not an exception: the Anti-Fraud team learned how to deal with clients' inquiries on gambling-related issues and risks as well as how to build communication based on people’s behavior." In conclusion, Vyshinskaia said: "We aim for perfection in our service, and we care about our clients because security and expertise are at the core of the service we offer at SOFTSWISS."</p>
<p>The Anti-Fraud Support is one of the company's key teams that is primarily focused on business-to-customer client support services. Those services cover sports betting as well as online casino brands. Thanks to its dedicated team of professionals, the Anti-Fraud Team resolved more than 75 complaints regarding suspicious activity of online casinos in Q1 alone. This translates to more than €2.8m ($2.8m) saved during the period.</p>
<p>Besides Anti-Fraud Support, SOFTSWISS Managed Services include First Line Support, VIP Player Support, Content Management Team, as well as Player Retention and Reactivation services.</p>
<p>Only recently, SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator announced a key global content distribution deal with Vibra Gaming, a gaming provider founded in Latin America, on Tuesday last week. At the time the deal was announced, Ramiro Atucha, Vibra Gaming's CEO, said that the company is delighted to team up with SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator. He also pointed out that the new collaboration will expand Vibra's potential and help it grow further.</p>
<p>Before that, in June, SOFTSWISS announced a management-level hire. As a result, the company hired the services of the iGaming industry veteran Jan Flores. Flores joined SOFTSWISS to serve as its new Deputy Chief Technology Officer.</p>
