<p>GLI is delighted to have been recognized by the Loteria do Estado de Paraná</p>
<p>Gaming Laboratories International (GLI) has secured accreditation in the State of Paraná, making it the first gaming testing laboratory to foray into Brazil. Its accreditation follows the formal launch of the laboratory accreditation process in Brazil.</p>
<p>GLI was cleared for launch by the Loteria do Estado de Paraná (LOTTOPAR), allowing it to perform testing and certification of lotteries and fixed-odds sports betting products. GLI’s job will be to make sure that these products meet the standards outlined by LOTTOPAR.</p>
<p>Brazil is currently clearing the way for the legalization of regulated sports betting. LOTTOPAR and the Government of Paraná, meanwhile, remain committed to providing safe and responsible experiences to the players, adhering to global safety standards.</p>
<p>GLI boasts 25 years of experience in the Latin American and Caribbean regions. The company fields a team of experts that evaluates gambling content quickly and reliably. GLI’s work helps regulators enact their policies and make sure that the industry is compliant with the rules.</p>
<p>Operators and suppliers, on the other hand, can benefit from GLI’s services to secure fast and efficient market entries.</p>
<p>GLI Is Excited to Have LOTTOPAR’s Approval</p>
<p>Karen Sierra Hughes, LOTTOPAR’s vice-president of Latin America, the Caribbean and Spain, noted that her team has worked closely with regulators across LATAM and the Caribbean for decades. GLI was also the first laboratory to secure accreditation in Peru, making it a pioneer in Latin America.</p>
<p>Hughes said that her team is very excited to have achieved another major milestone by becoming the first laboratory to secure LOTTOPAR’s approval. She thanked LOTTOPAR for its trust and thanked the company for its recognition of GLI.</p>
<p>We are grateful to LOTTOPAR for their dedication to the regulated lottery and sports betting industry and for recognizing GLI for our accreditations, capabilities, and expertise. Karen Sierra Hughes, VP of LATAM, Caribbean and Spain, GLI</p>
<p>GLI is an industry juggernaut with a presence in a whopping 567 jurisdictions across the world. The company’s specialty is ensuring that land-based, iGaming and lottery companies are compliant with the rules outlined by the local regulators.</p>
<p>GLI offers a full suite of compliance services that allows its partners to navigate the complex regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, GLI issued a certification to the gaming supplier FSB, allowing it to provide its products in South Africa. Around the same time, the compliance specialist hired two HR veterans who are helping it bolster its relationship with governments and tribal agencies.</p>
