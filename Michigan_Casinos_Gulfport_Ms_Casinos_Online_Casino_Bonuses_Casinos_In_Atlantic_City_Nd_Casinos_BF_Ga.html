<p>BF Games, a respected developer of iGaming content and author of numerous outstanding titles such as Stunning Hot, Burning Slots, Lucky Symbols, Royal Crown, and Book of God, has doubled down on its efforts in the regulated iGaming market in Romania through a partnership with Superbet.ro, the companies shared.</p>
<p>The two companies have agreed to a content deal that will make BF Games’ portfolio of more than 72 excellent games available to some extent in the market. BF Games has distinct games such as Rome Warrior, Steampunk Big City, Pagoda of Fortune, Star Fortune, Book of Ming, and other titles that will all be made available to Superbet.ro customers in Romania. BF Games head of business development Claudia Melcaru welcomed the news and said that she expected the company’s games to prove particularly popular in Romania, adding:</p>
<p>"Our portfolio has proven successful in Romania, and we have great knowledge of the player preferences in the region which ensures we can offer Superbet’s local players maximum excitement and entertainment."</p>
<p>A big part of the games the operator and players will be interested in is still in development. BF Games has confirmed that it has an exciting roadmap that will mean more than one title per month for Superbet players to try. The two partners have already collaborated on content in Croatia, and they are determined to replicate their success here as well.</p>
<p>BF Games is particularly focused on regulated markets in Europe and has access to numerous jurisdictions already. Notably, the company is licensed to provide products and slots under a Great Britain Gambling Commission license and Malta Gaming Authority permits.</p>
<p>BF Games has been present for a while in Romania now. In June, the company revealed that it has teamed up with Fortuna, Entertainment Group’s local iGaming and casino brand Casapariurilor.ro, launching a portfolio of 30 dedicated titles. Among those were already mentioned games such as Burning Slots, Cave of Fortune, Book of Gold, and more. All in all, BF Games remains focused on providing players in all jurisdictions with a great entertainment product.</p>
<p>Romania has been a particularly vibrant iGaming market with other suppliers also piling on the opportunity to secure a share. In August, LEAP Gaming struck a partnership with Kaizen Gaming International to also enter the market.</p>
