<p>Mobile sports betting app theScore is on the verge of a major expansion. On Tuesday, the Canadian-based company announced it earned a key certification for its application to be used in Colorado.</p>

<p>The app and the player account management platform that Score Media and Gaming Inc. plan to use in Colorado received GLI-33 certification from Gaming Laboratories International. It’s a key regulatory requirement before the app can officially launch in the state.</p>
<p>The company expects to roll out its app in the state this summer, contingent on the approval of the Colorado Division of Gaming. It gained access to the state through a 10-year agreement reached in January with a Jacobs Entertainment subsidiary, and state officials granted a temporary license in March.</p>
<p>TheScore is a sports media company that focuses on delivering content to mobile consumers. Last year, in partnership with platform developer Bet.Works, theScore entered the sports betting realm and received approval to take wagers in New Jersey. It is one of three skins for Monmouth Park.</p>
<p>In November, theScore released FUSE, which integrates the sports media app with the sportsbook app. That allows consumers to view odds and create bets on the content site and then, with a click, enter the betting app to submit the wager.</p>
<p>Indiana App Certified, Too</p>
<p>July’s been a busy month for theScore. On Friday, the company announced it received GLI-33 certification for its Indiana app.</p>
<p>This approval is a significant milestone and reflects the hard work of our engineering and product team, who have been working tirelessly to ready theScore Bet for launch in Indiana as part of our multi-state expansion,” said theScore Founder and CEO John Levy in a statement.</p>
<p>In Indiana, theScore’s app will serve as a skin for Penn National Gaming.</p>
<p>Like Colorado, theScore expects to launch in the Hoosier State this summer, pending approval from the Indiana Gaming Commission. The commission approved a temporary license for the app in May.</p>
<p>Busy Year for theScore</p>
<p>In addition to expanding, theScore has also been busy this year working on partnerships with professional sports organizations.</p>
<p>Last month, the company announced it secured an Authorized Gaming Operator agreement with MLB. That gives the app rights to use official league data for scoring bets as well as the right to use official league logos for the betting app. Earlier this year, it landed a similar deal with the NBA.</p>
<p>And theScore isn’t just keen on growing in the US, it’s also supported efforts to expand sports betting in its home country. Currently, only parlay betting, or betting on the outcome of multiple games and events, is allowed. Members of Parliament have proposed making single-game betting legal.</p>
<p>The measure has the support of the major league commissioners whose leagues have teams that play in Canada.</p>
<p>“We’re often asked by our Canadian users how they can bet through theScore, a sports media platform they already know and trust, versus the current list of unregulated offshore providers,” Levy said in a statement last month. “When the opportunity to do that arises, theScore will be ready.”</p>
