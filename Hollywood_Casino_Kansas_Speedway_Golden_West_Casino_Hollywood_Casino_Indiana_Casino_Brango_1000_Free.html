<p>German bookmaker Tipico is moving closer to its US debut, as it has received a conditional approval to launch sports betting in New Jersey from the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE). The sports betting operator is also planning to add iGaming to its product offering as soon as the required approval is granted.</p>
<p>Ocean Casino Resort Provides NJ Market Access</p>
<p>Tipico partnered with Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City to gain market access and, ahead of the imminent launch of its proprietary platform, secured a content deal with NetEnt in July, to introduce a range of NetEnt’s slot and table games. Under the terms of the deal, Tipico will also get access to NetEnt’s dedicated suite of marketing tools to boost its marketing efforts in the state.</p>
<p>“At Tipico, we knew that New Jersey would be the perfect state for us to kick-start our business in the U.S. because of its sophisticated mobile sports betting audience and mature regulatory and licensing environment.” Adrian Vella, Managing Director, Tipico USA Technology</p>
<p>Milestone for Tipico’s US Journey</p>
<p>The managing director for the US business of the German sportsbook provider noted the company set its headquarters in the New York metro area and is looking to expand its team, dedicating time, energy, and resources to lay the foundation of a long-term business in the US market. The conditional approval for sports betting in the state marks an important milestone in the long journey ahead, Adrian Vella concluded.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to be expanding our mobile sportsbook offering to a new international market. At Tipico, we are truly passionate about enhancing the thrill of sport, bringing fans even closer to the game they love. Regulatory approval from the state of New Jersey is another significant step toward introducing U.S. consumers to our unique sports betting platform.” Joachim Baca, CEO, Tipico</p>
<p>Bringing its own sports betting technology to New Jersey, on top of 15 years of European Experience in sports betting, Tipico believes it has all the ingredients to successfully bring its sportsbook offering to the state and begin to expand into other US jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Also in July, Tipico signed a deal with Scientific Games (SG) to power its upcoming iGaming offering by utilizing SG’s OpenGaming product suite. Besides the aggregation platform, under the terms of the deal, SG will deliver a comprehensive library of more than 2,000 games, developed in-house and by third parties, to support the US debut of Tipico in New Jersey.</p>
