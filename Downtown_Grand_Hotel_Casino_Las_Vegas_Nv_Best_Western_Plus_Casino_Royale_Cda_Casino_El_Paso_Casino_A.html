<p>The new public relations appointees are both longtime members of Mohegan and have participated in the organization of various events</p>
<p>Mohegan, a casino and entertainment giant, has announced two new additions to its corporate PR team. The company has designated Cody Chapman as a PR director and Charisse Huff as a PR manager. As members of the PR team, the two appointees will be responsible for Mohegan’s properties.</p>
<p>Mohegan said that Chapman and Huff will help the company with external communication strategies. They will oversee media relations for certain Mohegan properties, primarily in the Northeast.</p>
<p>As members of the corporate PR team, the two hires will work under Mohegan’s VP of corporate communications, Jennifer Ballester. The latter is also one of the company’s core members and has been with Mohegan since the opening of Mohegan Sun in 1996.</p>
<p>The Two New Appointees Are Longtime Mohegan Members</p>
<p>Cody Chapman is a graduate of Central Connecticut State University and also a longtime member of the Mohegan company. A member of the tribe itself, Chapman has worked with the company as a PR specialist since 2007. Five years into his career with the company, the employee was promoted to sports &amp; entertainment publicist and was responsible for media relations for the 10,000-seat Mohegan Sun Arena. In 2015, Chapman became PR manager for the Mohegan Sun property – a role he retained until his current promotion.</p>
<p>Charisse Huff, on the other hand, is a newer member of the Mohegan family. A graduate of the University of Hartford, Huff joined the Mohegan Sun team as a PR specialist in 2018. In 2021, Huff was promoted to communications manager and was tasked with synergizing and streamlining all major promotional efforts across PR, social media, advertising and Internet marketing.</p>
<p>In her newest position, Huff will be responsible for day-to-day PR and will lead efforts for major company announcements, key events and milestones across the Mohegan Sun, Mohegan Pennsylvania and PA and Resorts Casino Hotel properties.</p>
<p>Mohegan added that Chapman and Huff will also be responsible for providing PR support to the company’s online gambling division, Mohegan Digital.</p>
<p>Chapman and Huff Have Been Involved in a Myriad of Recent Events</p>
<p>Chapman and Huff have already worked on other major events Mohegan organized. Some of the most recent events they supported include the 25th anniversary of the Mohegan Sun property, the openings of TAO Asian Bistro &amp; Lounge and the Mohegan Sun FanDuel Sportsbook, and the recent edition of the annual Sun Wine &amp; Food Fest.</p>
<p>Mohegan recently provided $120 million to its Inspire Integrated Resort in South Korea. The new property is expected to welcome its first guests soon.</p>
