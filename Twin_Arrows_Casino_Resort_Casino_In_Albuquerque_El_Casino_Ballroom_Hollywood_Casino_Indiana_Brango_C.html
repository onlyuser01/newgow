    <h1>Twin Arrows Casino Resort Casino In Albuquerque El Casino Ballroom Hollywood Casino Indiana Brango C</h1>

<p>Very good days,</p>
<p>Once again, I would like to state that I have made two complaints that are different.</p>
<p>1.- It is due to a transfer that Binance made to Mystake that due to an error in the MEMO number of my Binance address, the Binance team verified that there was an error in my memo number and after the dispute process, Binance made the transfer to Mystake as stated in TxID No. 21675296CF8B526C4BFF30FFC27AF322F0C8F454ADDB4673120E554775EDD6D3.</p>
<p>Mystake has not taken the time and has not wanted to review the transaction where Binance already returned the money. Attached to this message is a communication that I had with Binance today where they explain and verify the transfer that they returned to Mystake through another transaction in favor of Mystake.</p>
<p>Please read the messages preceding this one.</p>
<p>2.- The second complaint is for having requested a Cash Back from the Mystake platform, since I had been losing US$350.00, they granted me 10% which is equivalent to $35.00, the rules are that I must bet 45 times said amount and maximum I can withdraw 5 times the sum of US$ 35.00, that is, maximum US$ 175.00</p>
<p>I didn't realize that I had exceeded the 45 times that I had to bet the US$35.00 that they gave me as a bonus which is equivalent to US$175.00 (5*US$35.00), however of the $402.00 that was at that time my withdrawal was for less , I made a withdrawal of US$ 168.50, which was a withdrawal that I made even below 175 dollars.</p>
<p>After reading Mystake's email, I went to the Mystake website and noticed that there were only US$ 175.00, that is, they had already removed the surpluses of more than $ 200</p>
<p>Okay, with my US$ 175.00 that are mine, I decided to continue playing all day, Sunday, August 13, 2023, I accumulated a little more winnings and after a while I withdrew the US$ 175.00 and I had a balance left to continue playing, with that balance I continued playing until I reached the figure of US$ 588.00, and at the end of the day, I decided to withdraw only US$ 455.00 and I decided to leave the remaining US$ 133.00 to continue playing at another time.</p>
<p>My big surprise this morning is that my earned funds have been taken away from me in their entirety, without any type of explanation and I feel that they have committed an abuse since an administrative withdrawal of US$ 588.00 appears that was not authorized by me, that is, apart from They rejected my withdrawal, they deposited it and they withdrew all the funds that are mine and that I earned.</p>
<p>In short, they took my funds twice, one in which it is correct that it was the first transaction but the second time it is totally incorrect since it was the product of money that is already mine and they had no reason to eliminate my withdrawals and worse still appropriate from them</p>
<p>I demand that my funds be credited to make their withdrawal, my username is joelred86</p>
