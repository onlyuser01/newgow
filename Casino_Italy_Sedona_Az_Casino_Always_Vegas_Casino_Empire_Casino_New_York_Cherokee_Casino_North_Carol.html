    <h1>Casino Italy Sedona Az Casino Always Vegas Casino Empire Casino New York Cherokee Casino North Carol</h1>

<p>"In principle you are right, but what you don't understand is that with your repeated statements you ensure that the operators keep withdrawing and in the end nobody gets their money anymore."</p>
<p>Because of my posts maybe the casino won't pay? It will be exactly because of that ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦</p>
<p>What you don't understand is that it has to be like this!</p>
<p>If they want to retreat they should do so as soon as possible before tormenting more players.</p>
<p>First clarify everything and then open a casino.</p>
<p>"I'm well aware that Zeus NV is owned by WP which in the past has retained millions of dollars in profits (for whatever reason) and it looks like the pattern is now repeating itself."</p>
<p>The reasons are up to you, they are cowardly criminals.</p>
<p>I knew this from the beginning and I mentioned it at the beginning because I think it's rude to scam people on the one hand and at the same time just open a new casino to continue tormenting the poor players!</p>
<p>And if I feel the need to say this SO PLAYERS KNOW what they're getting into, that's my business and you have absolutely no business.</p>
<p>I bet by my comments some are not in the situation now that they have been waiting for their funds for 3 months and are stressed.</p>
<p>You only see what you want to see, nothing more.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing I've heard in a long time is that you're now writing that it's my fault that Scatterhall might not pay out anymore.</p>
<p>If I help expose this casino for what it is, I'll be glad, regardless of what you or others think of it.</p>
<p>The guru team has so much work to do that you can't blame them.</p>
<p>There are many casinos that copy others almost 100% but have nothing to do with the casinos in question.</p>
<p>It's definitely not Guru's job to screw things up by guesswork.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Guru team has more work to do than any casino!</p>
<p>Casinos care about their players, but Guru cares about all players from every casino you know.</p>
<p>My opinion is that Scatterhall should finally get going, it's enough to keep saying the same thing after 3 months.</p>
<p>But letting people wait 3 months and accepting deposits at the same time is anything but serious for me and definitely a reason not to recommend this casino.</p>
<p>They know exactly what they're doing.</p>
<p>For 3 months they keep telling people the same thing.</p>
<p>I play in so many casinos day by day but none have this kind of problems that lasts 3 months but being able to pay money.</p>
<p>For me it's up to me.</p>
<p>People were only warned because they wanted to avoid EXACTLY this situation, so players wouldn't waste their time chasing their honestly won funds.</p>
<p>But why do I say that someone who, although he knows that Scatterhall belongs to WP, still plays there and still talks about it sometimes well, even though he himself says how many millions they cheated the players.</p>
<p>Either you are part of the casino or they promised you treats if you shoot me ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>That's the impression you and the alleged king give.</p>
<p>Have fun with your great casino that makes people wait 3 months while there are casinos that pay you out within hours without a 500 â‚¬ limit without constantly coming up with any problems that you are supposed to have had for 3 months, but strangely in between some can still pay out ^^</p>
<p>I know some streamers.</p>
<p>And a few of them still get their money during this time, when there are supposedly problems.</p>
<p>Advertising is just important so that you can cash in nicely, ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>That's it from me, I won't even answer you anymore because I said what I think and will always do &amp; even more so if it upsets you or you claim to be the guilty one.</p>
