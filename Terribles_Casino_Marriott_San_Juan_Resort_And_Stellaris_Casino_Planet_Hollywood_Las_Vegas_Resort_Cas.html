<p>Gor Mahia FC and AFC Leopards SC, the two football rivals from the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) announced almost simultaneously that their lookout for a new sponsor found a successful resolution, as both signed 3-year sponsorship deals with Betsafe.</p>
<p>Betsafe Fills the SportPesa Void</p>
<p>Betsson-owned Betsafe, through its Kenyan subsidiary Bet High Kenya Ltd signed deals with the KPL football clubs to become their main sponsor for the next three years. As per the deals, AFC Leopard will receive around $375,000 annually, while 18-times KPL champion Gor Mahia FC will be supported with approximately $515,000 per year.</p>
<p>“We will be launching in the Kenyan market very soon and our top priority is to support Kenyan football. Being a responsible gaming provider since the very beginning we aim to bring more engagement and excitement together with Leopards SC in the near future.” Tom Bwana, PR &amp; Partner Manager, Bet High (K) Ltd</p>
<p>Both football clubs from the Kenyan capital Nairobi faced serious financial constraints after main KPL sponsor and their sponsor SportPesa cancelled all sponsorship deals in August 2019, having to ask their fans for financial aid to pay player salaries at one point. Gor Mahia FC and AFC Leopards are excited to have a new financial partner and understandably relieved to leave the past struggles behind.</p>
<p>“We are very happy to announce this deal with Betsafe. A very welcomed message to all our fans that we have secured long term financial support from a strong and safe partner. With Betsafe, we get an engaged and reliable partner with a focus on responsible gaming. But also, a partner who shares our passion and values about football and the excitement that comes with it.” Ambrose Rachier, Chairman, Gor Mahia FC</p>
<p>Fan Engagement Ahead of Official Launch</p>
<p>Betsafe is yet to start operations in Kenya, but eager to position itself as a reliable sports and financial partner, while getting new opportunities to engage with the fan base of the two most popular football clubs in the premier league of the country.</p>
<p>“We are very proud and humbled to support a top-class football club in Kenya. With one of the largest fan bases in the country, this exciting partnership provides Betsafe with the perfect platform to engage football fans with our unique offering.” Tom Bwana, PR &amp; Partner Manager, Bet High (K) Ltd</p>
<p>AFC Leopards chairman Dr. Dan Shikanda expressed his delight that Betsafe became the official head and shirt sponsor of the club.</p>
<p>“We are very proud to announce this new major deal with the Betsafe brand, especially to our fans. For us, this sponsorship means everything, as it gives us a sense of security and work peace to be able to focus even more on becoming the best team in the country. With Betsafe, we have a reliable partner with strong focus on responsible gaming and passion for football.” Dr. Dan Shikanda, Chairman, AFC Leopards SC</p>
