<p>Pinnacle Solution, a sportsbook management software firm, has achieved another milestone by obtaining a license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). This development will allow the company to expand its geographical footprint and bring its products to new markets as well as collaborate with more established partners.</p>
<p>Pinnacle Welcomes MGA License as Pivot towards Growth</p>
<p>Pinnacle will focus on Malta-based companies which are eager to benefit from its products and it has a long-planned development for the company. Pinnacle CEO Paris Smith said that the company’s trading practices and technology stack makes it easy for partners to scale up their offers and deliver a state-of-the-art experience, which is precisely what they are after Smith argued, and added:</p>
<p>“Obtaining the MGA license is proof that our expert teams have developed products that meet the market’s demands and high standards, and we’re now looking forward to servicing new partners in more markets with the ultimate sports betting, esports, and risk management solutions.” Pinnacle CEO Paris Smith</p>
<p>Pinnacle Solution is also pivoting towards a new esports product that will be revealed during the ICE meet-up in London in April. Both that product and the MGA license would define the company’s strategy for the second half of the year, Smith confirmed in a statement and urged sports betting brands to take heed.</p>
<p>Pinnacle has been moving on esports for several years now. The company launched a new plug-and-play esports hub in October last year. In the meantime, the company managed to host several esports events sponsored by the Pinnacle brand. The Pinnacle Cup has attracted prominent sponsors including AstroPay. In the meantime, other companies have been making moves in the esports sector as well. Entain has appointed Brain Lancey as its new chief marketing officer for Unikrn, which the entertainment giant acquired in 2021.</p>
