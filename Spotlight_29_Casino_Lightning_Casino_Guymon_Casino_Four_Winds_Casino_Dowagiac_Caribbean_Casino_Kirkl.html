    <h1>Spotlight 29 Casino Lightning Casino Guymon Casino Four Winds Casino Dowagiac Caribbean Casino Kirkl</h1>

<p>The fifth season of Dana White’s Contender Series returns on Tuesday with six bouts. The headliner fight of the event is Jansey Silva (7-1) vs Gadzhi Omargadzhiev (12-0), which is by far the most interesting on the list.</p>
<p>As there’s a UFC contract at stake, you can be sure that both fighters will give their very best inside the octagon. Still, bookmakers seem to think Omargadzhiev will get the job done easily. The moneyline odds on the Russian fighter are as short as -510.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s clear that Silva will not give up without a fight. The big question is can he cause an upset?</p>
<p>Jansey Silva vs Gadzhi Omargadzhiev Odds (Dana White’s Contender Series)</p>
<p>All odds are per DraftKings as of October 25.</p>
<p>Moneyline</p>
<p>Jansey Silva +375 Gadzhi Omargadzhiev -510</p>

<p>Omargadzhiev Planning a KO Win</p>
<p>The guy’s won most of his fights by KO/TKO, many of which happened in Round 1. His fighting style is such that he spends most of the time on his feet, looking for a way to put his rival to sleep with a powerful one-punch KO.</p>
<p>The good news for him is that his opponent’s only loss of the career happened that way. The bad news for Omargadzhiev is that Silva is very good on the floor. The Russian will have to be careful not to allow the Brazilian to take him down and the best way to do it is to be aggressive with the punches from the very start.</p>
<p>Omargadzhiev definitely has the skills to do so, evident from the fact that his record is nothing short of impressive. So far, he’s without a single defeat in his professional career with 12 wins. Each of those wins came against fighters who had at least a .500 record.</p>
<p>His most recent win happened against his fellow Russian Vladimir Vasilyev, who was 7-0 before the fight. Knowing all this, it’s only logical to expect Omargadzhiev to win on Tuesday. Of course, surprises do happen in MMA. In fact, much stranger things have happened in Dana White’s Contender Series, so no one should underestimate Silva.</p>
<p>Does Silva Have a Special Plan for Omargadzhiev?</p>
<p>Although it’s true that Silva’s finished most of his fights by KO/TKO, the Brazilian is pretty good on the floor. Actually, judging by his previous performances, the guy seems to be good in all aspects. The trouble is that he still hasn’t faced such a good opponent as Gadzhi Omargadzhiev.</p>
<p>Actually, Silva has only won against fighters with a negative career record or those who previously hadn’t fought a single professional bout. That said, Silva’s toughest challenge of his career comes this Tuesday. If he wants to win, he’ll have to come up with a very special fight plan.</p>
<p>Knowing what we know about the two of them, Silva’s best chance might be to try and take Omargadzhiev down. Of course, that comes with a risk that he could end up knocked out. Still, it’s a risk that Silva is probably willing to take.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, it probably isn’t going to pay off. Gadzhi Omargadzhiev is simply a better fighter than him.</p>
<p>Pick: Gadzhi Omargadzhiev to win.</p>
