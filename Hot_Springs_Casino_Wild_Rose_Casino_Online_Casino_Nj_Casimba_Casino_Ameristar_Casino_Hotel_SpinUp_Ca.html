    <h1>Hot Springs Casino Wild Rose Casino Online Casino Nj Casimba Casino Ameristar Casino Hotel SpinUp Ca</h1>

<p>I have been a member of this casino for over 2 years in that time deposited over a million euros , never really won but in the past 8 weeks have had a couple of decent wins , admittedly always eventually got my money , in the last two weeks deposited over 48k and have won 75k ,</p>
<p>all limits and rules were relaxed over the past 18months to encourage me to play more , 5 weeks ago they started charging me 10% for withdrawals which i have been paying , now that they owe me 63k they sent me this email</p>
<p>Dear Jonathan,</p>
<p>I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about the changes in your VIP status with us. Unfortunately, due to recent developments and circumstances, we can no longer consider you as a VIP member of our Casino.</p>
<p>I understand that this news may be disappointing for you, and I want to apologize for any inconvenience it may cause. However, please know that this decision was not made lightly, and we believe it is in the best interest of both parties.</p>
<p>In regard to your pending withdrawal of â‚¬ 63456.52, we would like to offer you a payment plan. We will pay you 20K per month until your withdrawal is fully approved. As you have already withdrawn 12K, we will approve 8K more for you to withdraw at this time.</p>
<p>We understand that this situation may be frustrating, but we ask that you remain patient with us as we work through the process. Our team will do everything we can to ensure a smooth and timely payout of your pending withdrawal.</p>
