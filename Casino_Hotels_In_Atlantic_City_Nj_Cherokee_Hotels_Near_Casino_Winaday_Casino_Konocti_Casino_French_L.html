<p>Leader in digital account-to-account payments Trustly announced a change in leadership after its chief executive officer Oscar Berglund decided to step down and take another role at the company.</p>
<p>Stepping Down as CEO, Assuming CBDO Role</p>
<p>Trustly CEO Berglund has decided to step down from his chief executive role and assume a new role as chief business development officer (CBDO), the payment provider announced in an official press release.</p>
<p>Following Berglund’s decision, the Board of Directors appointed current Chairman Johan Tjärnberg as the new company CEO effective January 17, 2022, while current board member and partner at Nordic Capital Advisors Fredrik Näslund will become the new Chairman.</p>
<p>Soon-to-be chairman Näslund commented on the shift at the helm, expressing the Board of Directors’ content that its chairman had agreed to step into the CEO role. On behalf of the board, he thanked Berglund for his “dedication and instrumental contributions” over a period of more than 10 years from the moment of the company’s inception.</p>
<p>“Going forward, Oscar will remain as an engaged shareholder and work closely with Johan in the new role of Chief Business Development Officer.” Fredrik Näslund, Board Member, Trustly</p>
<p>The past year saw significant growth at Trustly across its core European and North American markets, as operations in North America contributed to nearly half of the group’s total now as compared to just one-fifth in the prior year.</p>
<p>Ripe for Change in Leadership</p>
<p>Considering the continuous growth in size and business complexity and having spent more than 5 years at Trustly as CEO, Berglund believed the moment was ripe for a change of leadership and ready to hand over the responsibilities to a new chief executive officer.</p>
<p>“I have worked with Johan for two years and can for the coming phase of the Company’s development think of no better candidate for the Trustly CEO job.” Oscar Berglund, CEO, Trustly</p>
<p>“I look forward to continuing to work closely with him and the rest of the team in my new role as Chief Business Development Officer, which will allow me to focus on Trustly’s high-impact projects and stakeholder interactions,” Berglund concluded.</p>
<p>With a long track record in the payments industry and almost 2 years as Chairman at Trustly, Tjärnberg looks to be the ideal candidate for the executive position, capable of leveraging his vast experience in scaling businesses and implementing innovations.</p>
<p>Commenting on his future role, Tjärnberg outlined his motivation to assume the responsibilities and lead the business that is “perfectly positioned to make digital payments seamless for everyone.”</p>
<p>“…I am looking forward to being part of the team that will continue to drive Trustly’s global expansion going forward.” Johan Tjärnberg, Chairman, Trustly</p>
<p>Tjärnberg’s resume also includes CFO and CEO roles at Point, a European-based payments provider, followed by the founding of an international payments business for in-store and online retailers Bambora in 2014. He also served in several managerial positions at Ingenico, including as EVP of Retail.</p>
