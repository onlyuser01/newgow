<p>IGT will be leading the cashless gaming era in Nevada after the company’s Resort Wallet cashless module received approval by the state regulator. The solution offers casino guests a cashless, effortless, and safe experience.</p>
<p>IGT to Lead the Cashless Gaming Era in Nevada</p>
<p>The global leader in gaming, International Game Technology PLC (IGT) announced on Tuesday this week that its Resort Wallet carded cashless module received approval by the regulator in Nevada. The module, which is a part of the company’s IGT ADVANTAGE casino management system successfully passed the final stage of regulatory approval and will be leading the new era in cashless gaming in Nevada.</p>
<p>By receiving the approval, IGT is allowed to deploy the module in the Silver State which will bring a cashless, effortless, and reduced contact slot gaming experience for casino guests. Players that use the Resort Wallet carded cashless module can use their loyalty card and transfer cash into a digital wallet from any slot machine that has enabled the Resort Wallet feature or a casino cash desk.</p>
<p>A Convenient and Safe Transfer of Funds</p>
<p>Furthermore, by using the PIN-protected card, players can either enter those funds to play the slot machine or cash out at any time. Another functionality for the players is to move some of their funds from the slot machine to their digital wallet and receive a printed ticket from the slot machine reflecting the balance.</p>
<p>“Our Resort Wallet solution ensures that our customers can experience the increased liquidity, player convenience, and enhanced safety that only cashless gaming can deliver.” Ryan Reddy, IGT Vice President, VLT, Systems and Payments Products</p>
<p>According to Ryan Reddy, IGT Vice President, by using the Resort Wallet solution, customers can experience convenience combined with enhanced safety. Furthermore, he added that the new solution will “heighten the player experience” to new levels and at the same time, it will position IGT customers as “technology leaders“. In conclusion, Reddy said that the company is grateful to the Nevada Gaming Control Board for approving the cashless product which debuts in the Silver State.</p>
<p>IGT’s Resort Wallet solution offers three different variations and the cardless cashless module is one of them. Another variation allows players to use a smartphone to pay for a slot machine or table games by using their Cashless Wagering Account. Last but not least, another variation of the cashless module allows players to access their Cashless Wagering Account securely and transfer funds to external sources such as bank accounts, e-Wallets, or debit cards.</p>
<p>Is Cashless Gaming the New Normal in 2021?</p>
<p>Besides paying for slot machine games, casino guests can also access their funds from their Resort Wallet Cashless Wagering Account to pay for table gaming, retail points of sale, and even sports betting.</p>
<p>Considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, undoubtedly cashless and mobile solutions will be a part of many businesses during this year. The innovative cashless solutions help with social distancing on the gaming floor by eliminating casino cash desk lines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cashless solutions bring operational efficiencies by reducing the cash handling and risks related to security. Machine maintenance is also reduced which results in fewer expenses for operators.</p>
