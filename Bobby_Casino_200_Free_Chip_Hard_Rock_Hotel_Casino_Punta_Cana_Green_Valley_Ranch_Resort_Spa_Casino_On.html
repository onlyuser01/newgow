    <h1>Bobby Casino 200 Free Chip Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa Casino On</h1>

<p>Wizard Games has become the latest developer to open the year with new and exciting games, and Piggi Bank proving one of the most promising entrants in this vertical. In the game, players will try to do what many wanted to do growing up – smash Piggi Banks with a hammer and get the best values across the 5x3 play grid.</p>
<p>Opening these saves could lead to a 200x payout per piggy bank, with the total payout potential simply teased as "huge" by the company. Players can also hunt for free spins, which will trigger even more respins and add tremendous value as Piggy Bank symbols get accrued during the free spins for a potentially big payday.</p>
<p>The Hammer Collect Symbol which enters the Free Spins game will also have accumulated vault value, building up to a very decent payout once you wrap up the level. Plus, there is a Buy Free Spins feature which is available in certain jurisdictions that allow the implementation of such gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>Wizard Games Managing Director Benedict McDonagh has welcomed the opportunity to see this game hit the market and expand the company’s already exciting portfolio with a brand new title that builds on a nostalgic overall theme but enhances it through the implementation of innovative mechanics.</p>
<p>"We want to be a go-to destination for operators looking to offer diverse, engaging content that stands out to a variety of demographics, and this light-hearted release is another step on our journey to this goal," McDonagh added.</p>
<p>Wizard Games has been steadily pumping out new games, building solid products that stand out by virtue of both their theme and underpinning mechanics created to add a level of excitement and out-of-the-box thinking that appeals to players at large.</p>
<p>Other recent and highly apt games released over the past months include Golden Elk, which tells the story of an enchanted forest and its many fairy-esque critters. Another excellent game marked by an intriguing theme and spot-on gameplay options is Grand Pepper Party introduced just at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Wizard Games is part of NeoGames, and it operates as an independent studio that is commonly featured in the Pariplay aggregation solution owned by its parent company.</p>
