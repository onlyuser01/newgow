    <h1>Casino Slot Boston Billiard Club Casino Nugget Casino Wendover Online Casino Deposit Bonus Borgata C</h1>

<p>Dear Gucciomarion,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I have checked the Welcome bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>The following terms &amp; conditions apply to the Welcome Bonus and should be fulfilled in order to be able to withdraw any bonus winnings.</p>
<p>100% up to €200 first deposit bonus</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Once a customer receives the bonus, in order to withdraw winnings from this bonus, they must wager the bonus 50 times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All wagering must be settled within 30 days of receiving the bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum bet amount counted towards wagering can not exceed the total bonus amount. Should a placed bet be higher than a bonus amount, only the latter will contribute towards wagering requirements. For example, if a customer has been credited with €10 bonus they place a €20 bet while having an active bonus, only €10 of this bet will be counted towards wagering of this bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount to be transferred to a real money account after wagering, cannot exceed the amount of all Live Casino and Slot bets from your real money account made during the wagering period, and the bonus multiplied by 10.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predatory, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>Could you please confirm that you received your winnings of €500?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
