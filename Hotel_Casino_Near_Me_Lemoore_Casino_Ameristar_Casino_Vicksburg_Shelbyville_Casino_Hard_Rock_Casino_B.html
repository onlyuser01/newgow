<p>Videoslots, an operator of iGaming products, will go live with RAW’s dedicated slot games under the SuperSlice engine, pending patent approval. This will be a first for the European market as RAW is launching the gameplay feature with Videoslots in a bid to break ground and introduce the innovative experience to audiences in licensed markets.</p>
<p>RAW Has Plenty of iGaming Engines and Features</p>
<p>The SuperSlice feature will be joining the SuperTracks engine to guarantee the smooth deployment and execution of gameplay across the board for players looking for all experiences. These new mechanics and engines will be innovating on the existing Battle of Slot concept which has been one of Videoslots’ signature styles over the years.</p>
<p>Now, the supplier company will have the opportunity to continue expanding on Videoslots’ portfolio of titles through licenses in multiple jurisdictions. RAW holds licenses in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Malta, which are all highly regulated and demanding European markets.</p>
<p>Strict regulation has not stifled innovation in any of these markets, though, enabling RAW and Videoslots to pursue their collaboration with surety. Commenting on the partnership opportunity, RAW iGaming CEO Tom Wood said:</p>
<p>This is a fantastic opportunity to offer our games to one of the premium casino destinations online as well as launch onto their unique Battle of Slots system. Videoslots is one of the true pioneers in Casino gamification and has always been at the forefront of pushing the envelope. RAW iGaming CEO Tom Wood</p>
<p>Wood thanked Videoslots for choosing to go live with the SuperTracks and SuperSlice engines, which he hoped would prove a hit with the company’s customers and help acquire new titles. Videoslots deputy CEO Ulle Skottling met the announcement in a similarly positive tone.</p>
<p>Happy to Be Hosting the New Engines</p>
<p>Skottling said that the company was excited to be hosting the SuperSlice and SuperTracks engine for its European portfolio, enabling players to experience them while enjoying the existing Battle of Slots offering. He added:</p>
<p>We have the biggest online casino offering in iGaming and it wouldn’t make sense to miss an opportunity to be the first to offer one of the market’s most exciting new game innovations to our players. Videoslots deputy CEO Ulle Skottling</p>
<p>Skottling said that the company is looking forward to seeing how people respond to the products as RAW brings new and innovative experiences to players.</p>
