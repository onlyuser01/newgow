<p>Neds, the Australian sports betting brand of the international gambling company Entain, has inked a new deal with Australia’s A-Leagues.</p>
<p>Neds Joins the A-Leagues</p>
<p>The agreement will see the brand promoted across many venues and grant it an appearance on the digital hub “Keepup.” The deal covers the next two years and will see Neds’ logo spread across various stadiums of Australia’s highest-level soccer league.</p>
<p>Additionally, Neds’s logo will be integrated into the various social media accounts of the A-Leagues. Lastly, the sports betting brand will be integrated into live match centers for both domestic and international games.</p>
<p>James Burnett, the chief marketing officer of Neds, shared his thoughts on the agreement. He revealed that since soccer is the most played sport in Australia and the world, a remarkable growth of interest has been seen across the A-Leagues.</p>
<p>Burnett pointed out that Neds is “a young and dynamic player” within the highly competitive sports betting market. Because of this, the partnership with the A-Leagues is a tremendous brand opportunity that will not only benefit the company with over 200 matches across the men’s and women’s leagues but will also give sports fans a chance to “take their support to the next level.”</p>
<p>The A-Leagues aren’t the only professional sports leagues that Entain’s Australian brand is partnering with. This summer, the sports betting company signed a deal with The Ultimate Fighting Championship. The deal saw Neds become UFC’s official betting partner for Australia and Burnett vowed to “take things to the neds level.”</p>
<p>The A-Leagues Welcome Neds by Their Side</p>
<p>Ant Hearne, the chief commercial officer of the A-Leagues, is just as delighted to choose the Entain-owned betting brand as the partner of the leagues. He considers Neds to be sports betting outlet that is not only quickly proving itself on the market but also offers a high degree of innovation. Thanks to that, Hearne believes that there is “a natural synergy” between the two organizations and both of them put fan experience at the forefront of their respective philosophies.</p>
<p>Hearne added that the upcoming 2021-2022 soccer season has prospects of producing some of the most exciting soccer games that the A-Leagues have ever seen. Because of that, the COO is happy to have Neds by the A-Leagues’ side as the two parties look to “connect, unify and empower fans to engage with the game, however, they choose.”</p>
<p>The A-Leagues recently penned a deal with the sports data and artificial intelligence tech provider Stats Perform in order to receive the latter’s state-of-the-art tech solutions.</p>
