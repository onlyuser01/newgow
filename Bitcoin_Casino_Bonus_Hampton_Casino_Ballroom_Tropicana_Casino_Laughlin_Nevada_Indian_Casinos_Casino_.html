<p>FirstBlood CEO Joe Zhou also expressed his confidence that the pair can work together to bring more esports to the region. Mr. Zhou added:</p>
<p>Divine league’s success is an instrumental proof to what our ultimate vision is at FirstBlood, the competitive side of video gaming could be available to just about anyone.</p>
