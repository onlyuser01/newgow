<p>The deal will provide esports fans with a safe, secure and dedicated betting platform built for their passions, BLAST’s Clarke said</p>
<p>Esports entertainment giant BLAST has unveiled a new agreement with the esports betting platform unikrn. As a result, BLAST will promote the operator’s brand across its tournaments and fan-centered events.</p>
<p>As announced by the two companies, unikrn will be “deeply embedded” into the BLAST fan experience. The esports betting company’s branding will be thoroughly promoted across BLAST’s fan activations, social giveaways and broadcasts.</p>
<p>Unikrn’s logo will also feature physically and digitally across the BLAST Premier tournament series, including the upcoming BLAST.tv Paris Major CS:GO competition.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the multi-year agreement will also see unikrn own the BLAST Picks segment, a series where BLAST’s analysts predict the outcomes of esports matches. The betting brand will also be featured in BLAST.tv’s PickEms where the CS:GO community can have its own share of esports predictions.</p>
<p>BLAST promised to share more details of the unikrn integration for the upcoming Major very soon.</p>
<p>Unikrn is an esports betting brand that is currently available to video game aficionados in Brazil and Canada (with the exception of Ontario). The brand offers exciting markets for esports betting, providing the new generation of gamers and esports fans with exciting wagering opportunities.</p>
<p>The operator also allows its users to become a part of the action and bet on their own skills with its UMode and Moneymatch products.</p>
<p>BLAST Is Thrilled to Team up with Unikrn</p>
<p>BLAST’s commercial director, Oliver Clarke, commented on the new agreement. He praised the operator’s tailored esports and gaming offerings and noted that his team is excited to welcome unikrn as its global partner.</p>

<p>Clarke added that 2023 will be an exciting year for BLAST because of the many events the organizer has planned.</p>
<p>Unikrn’s chief executive officer, Justin Dellario, also voiced his thoughts on the agreement. He applauded BLAST for becoming an epicenter of esports action and being behind some of the best CS:GO events in history.</p>
<p>unikrn is built for these moments when fans are looking for the deepest and best possible experience as they root on their favorite players and teams. We are thrilled to be BLAST’s partner and to bring our world-class insights and betting opportunities to its millions of fans. Justin Dellario, chief executive officer, unikrn</p>
