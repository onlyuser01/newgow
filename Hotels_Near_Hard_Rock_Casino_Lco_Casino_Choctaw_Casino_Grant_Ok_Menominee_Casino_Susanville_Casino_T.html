<p>IGT extends partnership with Texas lottery</p>
<p>The company revealed on Wednesday that its subsidiary, IGT Global Solutions Corporation, inked a 10-year partnership extension with the Texas Lottery. Under the terms of the extended partnership, IGT will continue to provide solutions and scratch ticket printing services for the Lottery. The recent announcement follows a competitive tender process. Now the duo’s collaboration will continue through August 2034.</p>
<p>Besides printing scratch tickets, IGT will offer its lottery operations and services for the Texas Lottery. These include its data center operations, field sales organization and lottery central system. The Lottery will also leverage IGT’s leading retail equipment and support, call center, marketing services, as well as warehouse and distribution services.</p>
<p>Additionally, IGT is currently the exclusive supplier for the Lottery’s Loteria family of games. The highly popular game generated more than $1.6 billion in sales in 2021 alone. Loteria offers six different price options: $50, $20, $10, $5, $3 and even $1. Last but not least, the recent collaboration grants the Lottery continuous access to IGT’s leading catalog of highly-popular games, designs and features, as well as licensed content.</p>

<p>Gary Grief, the Texas Lottery’s executive director, revealed that since the inception of the Lottery back in 1992, IGT was a strategic partner. He explained that by collaborating with the leading gaming company, the Lottery was able to generate more than $35 billion in revenue for good causes. Last but not least, Grief said that the Lottery is looking forward to continuing its collaboration with IGT to provide innovative and entertaining scratch tickets.</p>
