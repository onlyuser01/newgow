<p>Warhogs: Hellaways is easily our favorite online slot for real money and certainly one of the best games to try in the United States. The game is designed by PureRNG and it comes with 200,704 paylines – this is a lot!</p>
<p>There is also a multiplier bonus feature that keeps on giving. The Hellaways is an original concept developed by the studio to activate hundreds of thousands of possible winning combinations, which combine very well with another of the slot’s signature features, Cascading Reels.</p>
<p>Oh, and did we mention that the Cascading Reels can be retriggered again and again, and again…? Well, they can!</p>
<p>If that wasn’t enough, you can access the Bonus Feature which is triggered with 3 Treasure Symbols. There, you get the chance to spin two Bonus Wheels which may let you have up to 12 Free Spins and a 25x multiplier. Warhogs: Hellaways is one of the best online slots to play if not the best!</p>
<p>Play Warhogs: Hellaways</p>
<p>Take the Bank</p>
<p>Take the Bank is another excellent Bonus Buy game that comes with some very big wins. The reels will offer you 75 paylines and there is a very thematic HEIST SPINS where every spin will bring you closer to another special feature – the Bomb Explosion!</p>
<p>You will get to benefit from the special Exploding Wilds every 10 Free Spins and the Free Spins levels may feature up to 10 Wilds, making for a very nice synergy indeed. The Robber Symbols will be converted into a WILD BOMB and wait for the MASTER BOMB COUNTDOWN to reach zero for some spectacular winnings indeed.</p>
<p>To get the 15 Free Spins, you will need to line up 3 POLICE CARS, which are the Bonus Symbol. Take the Bank is not just a mighty rewarding slot, it’s one of the most thematic games you can play in any casino and a worthwhile addition to the list of best online slots for real money.</p>
<p>Play Take the Bank</p>
<p>Triple Juicy Drops</p>

<p>Wrath of Thor Hold and Win</p>
<p>It’s Hammer Time with Wrath of Thor: Hold and Win, one of the best online slots you can try this year. If you love the Viking theme, you are bound to love this slot. There is a special Stacked Mystery symbol carved out as a Nordic rune which will be replaced by Random Symbols after the reel spin is done.</p>
<p>This adds to the mystery as it were of the gameplay and makes for a far more thematic experience across the board. You also get the very special Nudging Multiplier Wild Reel that appears on reel 3 and seems to embody the God of Thunder himself!</p>
<p>The symbol is formed when a regular Wild Symbol nudges up or down to create the FULL WILD REEL and apply Multipliers up to 10x. Plus, players get to enjoy the Hold and Win Bonus Level which will entice you with hefty payouts and offer a grand prize of 2,000.00.</p>
<p>With 243 ways to win, Wrath of Thor Hold and Win is one of those authentic slot experiences that we can surely call the best!</p>

<p>12 Animals</p>
<p>12 Animals is a highly thematic and highly rewarding slot you can find at some of the best slot casinos, offering you a massive 96% return and fun and pacey gameplay to revel in. The title features 30 paylines and a very clever “seasonal play,” where the in-game calendar will progress from winter through spring, through summer, and then autumn. It’s a nice and highly thematic touch to keep you entertained, but it’s hardly all there is to the game.</p>
<p>So, other than being highly thematic, 12 Animals is also very fun on the core level, owing to excellent graphics, a generous RTP, and more. There is a very special Seasonal Wheel that will make it possible for you to enjoy even better multipliers playing your favorite game. If you are a betting man or woman, then you might also appreciate the Heads or Tails feature, to speak nothing of the free spins and other features that are simply loaded into this game.</p>
