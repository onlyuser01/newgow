<p>It sounds really good only I want is just to get my money back, I am a father of two children with a normal job and I have never won so much money last I can assure you that I would never in my wildest imagination get for me to waste 80,000 euros I insist that there has been a system error or something similar I am so sorry this has happened. I have discussed back and forth with dream vegas about this and I honestly think they have not been particularly cooperative willing or understanding in this matter, I would never allow anything as stupid as losing 80,000 euros for me and my family is this giant a lot of money and after this has happened, I have been in a really bad mood and have not been able to focus on work or time with my children, this mistake that has happened has ruined my whole life !!! I have now for several weeks tried to explain to dream vegas that this is not a mistake on my part. I won just over 80,000 euros and was so happy then I logged out because the page froze when I log in again just a few hours later and I see that my account next is in zero. I think this is a mistake so I try to deposit money no one in the hope that my balance will undermine but nothing happened so I tried to play megaball again to see if they would help but without luck then I tried to deposit again money but no help on my balance.! Then I log out again to sleep and hoped that the error was fixed when I woke up in the morning then I log in. Again and see that my balance is still almost over. Then I contact dream vegas and in the first place they do not really seem like they take me seriously but I stick to what has happened I am then sent around to all the different operators and everyone says I will wait to respond from their support team! After a long wait, they finally answer, but they mean that I myself who have spent the money on games, which is a lie, as I said, then I would never gamble anything with such a sum. Dream vegas are quick to block my account so I or no one else has access to it, then I try several times to get my game history without luck then I am told to wait further for their support team after a long wait to get I finally get my history, all our conversations are also in the attached file that dreamvegas has sent to me, the one that I then sent to you here at casino guru. During the whole period this has been going on then I have felt badly treated and it has been very difficult to get any answers from dream vegas. Now they have closed my case and say that they have done all the investigations they can and do not want to discuss this further! I really hope that you at guru casino can help me solve this I have also tried to apply for a refund but this was also put down and denied as they can not take any responsibility for what has happened as they write in their email. You should know that all this has resulted in me and my partner going in a seat I can not see my children and I go and feel really bad in the whole body all the time and have a very hard time letting go of this my mood is so bad that the smallest little thing can make me explode I've even had thoughts of taking my own life.! I can assure you that they must have happened some kind of technical error in this matter I have 2 testify that this is exactly what has happened my now former partner and her brother was by my side that night where we sat and played together on dreamvegas!</p>
