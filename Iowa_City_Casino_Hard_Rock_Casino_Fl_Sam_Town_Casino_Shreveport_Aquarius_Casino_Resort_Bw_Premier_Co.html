    <h1>Iowa City Casino Hard Rock Casino Fl Sam Town Casino Shreveport Aquarius Casino Resort Bw Premier Co</h1>

<p>NeoGames has struck a partnership with Intralot do Brasil, the operator of the Loteria Mineira, and will as a result extend iLottery and sports betting solutions in the country for the first time. Intralot has been operating the Minas Gerais state lottery for more than 10 years now and will now see NeoGames deploy its BtoBet division which was recently acquired from Aspire Global for a SEK4.3 billion or $423.5 million deal at the time.</p>
<p>NeoGames to Land iLottery and Sports Betting Expertise</p>
<p>NeoGames’ expertise will prove invaluable in building the digital platform for the state lottery and helping it make a more pronounced shift towards interactive lottery products. Improvements will come across the board thanks to the NeoSphere platform developed by NeoGames which will launch with Intralot do Brasil.</p>
<p>Furthermore, NeoGames Studio will also contribute a number of premium titles developed to appeal to a wide range of customers and meet player expectations in global markets. Commenting on this partnership, NeoGames chief executive officer Moti Malul welcomed the opportunity and its strategic significance for the company:</p>
<p>Working with the professional team at Intralot do Brasil, we are truly excited to support the goals of Loteria Mineira. NeoGames chief executive officer Moti Malul</p>
<p>By delivering what is an industry-leading platform, NeoGames is confident that its platform will meet all pre-agreed targets. This includes player-focused services, established games and genres, and the deployment of the BtoBet sports betting platform. The executive added:</p>
<p>By early next year, we will provide online lottery and sports betting players in Minas Gerais with an exceptional online gaming experience. NeoGames chief executive officer Moti Malul</p>
<p>Malul expressed hopes that the two companies may continue to work together in the future as NeoGames will seek to help Intralot do Brasil achieve commercial success and drive better engagement.</p>
<p>Building upon the Digital Format</p>
<p>Intralot do Brasil CEO and founder Sérgio Alvarenga was similarly pleased with the development. He was pleased to enter this partnership with NeoGames as it is designed to significantly bolster the company’s existing operations and offer a new digital format that will hopefully improve engagement and strike home with players in Minas Gerais.</p>
<p>The new modalities and investments in technology are also part of the expansion plan for new states and federal licenses. Intralot do Brasil CEO and founder Sérgio Alvarenga</p>
<p>Alvarenga added that NeoGames is one of the most innovative iLottery developers out there and through this partnership, Intralot do Brasil will be in a good bargaining position to launch its products in other states, and possibly jurisdictions. Alvarenga is confident that this partnership will drive the lottery product forward.</p>
