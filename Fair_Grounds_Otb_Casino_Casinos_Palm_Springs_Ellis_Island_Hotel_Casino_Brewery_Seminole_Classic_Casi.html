    <h1>Fair Grounds Otb Casino Casinos Palm Springs Ellis Island Hotel Casino Brewery Seminole Classic Casi</h1>

<p>I made two deposits to the casino. First deposit was played down. The second deposit resulted in a win.</p>
<p>I submitted all of my kyc documents as per the conditions listed on the casinos website. Including a screenshot of the deposit showing the amount, date and name of the merchant.</p>
<p>I provided proof of my deposits paid to the casino. However the casino advised me there has been issues with the payment provider they use in terms of verifying my deposit. Despite me showing proof of authorisation. I made the deposit via Apple Pay, I note that since that time Apple Pay is no longer available for deposits?</p>
<p>I have then been advised on live chat that my account is fully verified and my withdrawal will be processed in due course, this has not happened.</p>
<p>For 5 days straight I have been told there is no update however they are waiting on their payment processor to fix the issue which never occurs.</p>
<p>i was asked to show proof the first deposit belonged to me, which I have done.</p>
<p>I am told nothing can be done until they resolve the issue on their side with no maximum eta to fix.</p>
<p>I have since contacted my bank who have advised me that my deposit paid was authorised and remains unsettled by the merchant. I donâ€™t believe this is my issue I deposited via an approved method, wagered the funds and played exactly as per the casinos terms and conditions.</p>
<p>i have more to add if needed including chat transcripts and additional proof if needed.</p>
<p>I have attached screenshots but need to upload more documents, maximum is 5.</p>
