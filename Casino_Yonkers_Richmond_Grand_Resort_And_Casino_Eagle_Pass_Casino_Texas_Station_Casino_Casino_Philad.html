    <h1>Casino Yonkers Richmond Grand Resort And Casino Eagle Pass Casino Texas Station Casino Casino Philad</h1>

<p>So on may 13 2020 the casino informed me finally after soooooo many documents they wanted and letters from my bank and bank statements they told me that 2000 cad was going to be sent by wire transfee until an total of 9500 would be paid out</p>
<p>Well I'm still sitting here with no 9500 I have tried contacting them they told to send in a bank statement. No problem so I have done that and still no response..I have contacted support everyday and every day they tell me how there busy with covid.. mean while I won at differnt casino and I got that money. My gf won at a casino shes been paid out. I won that money fair and square. And I just dont understand why it's not in my bank account and why you have such crappy customer service. I just want my money</p>
<p>Than</p>
