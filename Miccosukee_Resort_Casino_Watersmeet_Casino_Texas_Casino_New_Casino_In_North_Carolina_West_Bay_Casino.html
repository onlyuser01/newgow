<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I think it would be good to clarify that self-exclusion is a responsible gambling tool designed for players struggling with control or facing gambling harm. In practical terms, it involves blocking the player's account and personal data, preventing further play.</p>
<p>It usually goes hand in hand with declaring a gambling problem in order to close the account as soon as possible. Closed accounts are not meant to be reopened. Here comes the word "exclusion" It's designed to be permanent.</p>
<p>In light of that, I understand the chat operators might be confused.</p>
<p>Players might want their accounts to be closed right away, even if there is no risk of an unhealthy temptation. In such a case, the account might be reopened in the future.</p>
<p>What you were seeking is sort of a cooling period, a time you want your account to be frozen. But soon after, you are allowed to get back and continue playing. Am I correct, please?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can't say I understand Freya's response. Since I'm not familiar with the whole background, I find it a bit confusing.</p>
<p>As a result of her action, though, your account was closed permanently, which is not what you asked for, I'd say.</p>
<p>And here comes another issue, If I may guess, I'd say she purely focused on the fact that you had opened two accounts, but she also, let's say, overlooked the context.</p>
<p>Well, may I know whether you've gotten your full balance out of the casino, please? Because if not, I'm quite convinced submitting a complaint won't be a mistake. As I say, I'm not fully familiar with the whole situation, yet a little investigation won't hurt, especially if you have some doubts.</p>
<p>Are you up to one?</p>
