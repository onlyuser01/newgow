<p>After surviving the most recent drawing, the jackpot from Mega Millions continues to grow and is expected to hit $48 million for the drawing this Friday</p>
<p>The drawing on October 6, 2023, completely changed the life of one Mega Millions player from Texas. The person, who purchased a ticket from a store near Sam’s Club in San Angelo, hit the lottery’s grand prize, a staggering $360 million jackpot. Matching all six numbers, 12, 24, 46, 57, 66 along with the Mega Ball number, 22, granted the lucky player the life-changing jackpot that also has a cash option of $159.6 million.</p>
<p>Now, the jackpot from Mega Millions continues to grow, considering that it successfully survived the drawing on Tuesday. The latest drawing from October 10, 2023, did not have a grand prize winner. However, one player was able to correctly guess all white balls, securing a second-tier prize of $1 million.</p>
<p>After surviving the most recent drawing, the Mega Millions jackpot now increases and it is estimated to hit some $48 million for the upcoming drawing scheduled for Friday, October 13, 2023. In case a lucky player hits the jackpot from the upcoming drawing, they would also be presented with a cash sum option of approximately $21.2 million. While that’s far from the close to $50 million figure, it is still undoubtedly a mouth-watering jackpot.</p>
<p>The latest drawing saw more than 720,000 winning tickets. In addition to the second-tier prize of $1 million, 20 tickets secured a $10,000 prize each, while three lucky players took home a Megaplier Prize of $40,000 each.</p>
<p>Some 460 ticket holders guessed correctly four white balls, taking home a $500 prize each. The recent Mega Millions drawing also saw 116 lucky players scoop up a Megaplier Prize of $2,000 each. Unsurprisingly, the highest number of winning tickets had a single number guessed correctly. Some 453,947 players guessed correctly the gold Mega ball, securing a $2 win.</p>
<p>Mega Millions Sees a Jackpot Spree</p>
<p>Last year, a total of six grand prizes were won from Mega Millions. A comparison to this year shows a significant increase in the grand prizes secured, considering that through October 10, 2023, there were 10 jackpots won. Prior to the most recent jackpot win, another grand prize of $39 million was won on August 15. This happened a week after the record-setting $1.6 billion Mega Millions jackpot was won in Florida on August 8, 2023.</p>
<p>Back in April, similar to August, two jackpots dropped in a matter of a week. A $483 million jackpot was hit on April 14, followed by a $20 million jackpot that was won on April 18. On the other hand, January has seen the most wins for the year so far, a total of four.</p>
