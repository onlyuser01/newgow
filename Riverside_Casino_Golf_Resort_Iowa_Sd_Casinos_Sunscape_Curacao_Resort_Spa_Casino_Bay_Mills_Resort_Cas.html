<p>Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW has reported on the appointment of commissioners to the new casino regulatory body that will oversee the gambling industry in New South Wales. By order of Minister for Hospitality and Racing Kevin Anderson, New South Wales’ Independent Casino Commission will now have five Casino Commissioners who hold the relevant experience to steer the new watchdog towards the future.</p>
<p>Anderson has chosen Philip Crawford, the current Chairperson for the Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority (ILGA) to take over as Chief Commissioner for the NICC, the NSW Independent Casino Commission as it were. The fact that Crawford has beenentrusted to see the transition through points to his qualities as a regulator and gambling industry expert who seeks to protect consumer interest and raise standards across the industry.</p>
<p>This appointment comes in the broader context of Star Entertainment and Crown Resorts facing a series of regulatory probes across the nation as questionable guests were often invited to attend casino floors in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, triggering a series of regulatory moves.</p>
<p>The regulatory review in NSW led to the creation of NICC which will now seek to elevate standards in the industry and ensure that past transgressions do not repeat themselves.</p>
<p>Anderson welcomed the appointment of Crawford and said that he offered a comprehensive understanding of the regulatoryissues that NSW faces and that need addressing. But Crawford will not be going it alone, as he will be joined by four commissioners who will also follow him from ILGA.</p>
<p>"Mr Crawford will be supported by four commissioners who will transition from ILGA. Janine Rolfe, Murray Smith, Craig Sahlin, and Stephen Parbery all have experience in casino regulation and other regulated industries," Anderson noted.</p>
<p>The new commission is expected to launch in earnest next Monday, September 5 and it will strive to also follow the recommendations of Adam Bell’s review of Star Entertainment. Presently, Crown Resorts is put under a special supervisory regime in the state. At the end of a two-year period, NICC will decide whether Crown Sydney may operate on its own without an independent auditor.</p>
<p>Regardless, as a newly established body, NICC will seek to raise standards in the industry tremendously so there may be no doubt about what constitutes an offense or questionable practice. The recent spate of probes into Star Entertainment and Crown Resorts were unlocked after the investigative efforts of journalists from Australian media outlets.</p>
