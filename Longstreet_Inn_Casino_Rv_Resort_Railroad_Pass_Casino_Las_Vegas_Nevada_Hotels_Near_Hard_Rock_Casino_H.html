    <h1>Longstreet Inn Casino Rv Resort Railroad Pass Casino Las Vegas Nevada Hotels Near Hard Rock Casino H</h1>

<p>Over the past two years I have invested over 70,000 dollars in this casino.</p>
<p>I had always been of the belief that once the wager had been met my winnings were mine.</p>
<p>T/C s say if a bonus chip had been given a limit of 500 max withdrawal applied for someone with VIP master player.</p>
<p>I am a gambler and had asked on more 15 occassions to close my account via email the VIP host cunningly would always furnish my account with 100 or 200 to keep me aboard and play consitently. There were times I begged for my account to be closed and explained clearly I couldnt help myself and needed it closed immediately. In 2 years they only did this twice.</p>
<p>The problem doesnt just sit there I then found they were tampering with my wager and resetting the wager to start from zero. When I called them out I was hurled anger and then they proceeded to communicate only via chat.</p>
<p>I had a big win of which I withdrew 6000 dollars of only which 2000 was paid claiming this was won off a bonus chip when I still had left over winnings in my account and I clear my wager everytime religiously prior play.</p>
<p>Further to that the vip manager took a very aggressive approach towards me and locked my account claming that rather than me resist the urge to continue play he would disable my account banking so I could not deposit. I was not paid two loyalty bonuses and funds took 18days to be delivered. I have only ever made 3 withdrawals in 2 years.</p>
<p>I am not a 5 minute player I have played this casino for 2 years every day. I knew the vip host Ron on intimate level of where he would pop in on chat regularly to ask avout my family.</p>
<p>I feel I was completely blindsided by this team who offered selective bonuses to ensure longevity of play but were calculating.</p>
<p>Once you selected either a free spin or a bonus and despite having your own money in and having met wager the casino will only payout the minimum.</p>
<p>When I had worked this out I called them out on it I had made a withdrawal for 6000 and I had 9000 still in my account no wager. I said to them ok if I deposit a further 100 dollars effectively a degree of the money would be mine. No one answered my emails I am a vip plsyer. I then recieved an email from support of which I was told to pop in to chat to communicate with my vip host with regards to my matter. I said I wanted clarity over email.</p>
<p>Of course I popped in as I was owed money. He told me out of courtesy he would only give me 2000 out of my six and he was being more than generous as I was only entitled to 500 on top of that I was to just play through the 9000 in my account as it wasnt worth anything because that too had been won on a bonus chip.</p>
<p>He was aggressive and rude and delayed my payment I was in there hands there was nothing I could do.</p>
<p>I would like a complete overhaul of my account.</p>
<p>I need help as I have been completely robbed.</p>
