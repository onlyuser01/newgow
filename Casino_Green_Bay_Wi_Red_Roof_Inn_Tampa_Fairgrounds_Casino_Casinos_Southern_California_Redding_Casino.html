<p>British betting exchange company Smarkets has reinforced its ranks with a new chief compliance officer (CCO). Seasoned industry veteran William Chambers will be joining straight from global sports betting company William Hill.</p>
<p>William Chambers Joins Smarkets’ Team</p>
<p>Chambers was previously William Hill’s chief compliance director for almost a year. Before his stint with the operator, he was part of mobility company Uber, where he was a regulatory lead for the UK and Ireland. Even further back, he occupied the position of head of compliance at Betway Group. Now, he will be replacing Smarkets’ previous chief compliance officer, Chris Baldacchino.</p>
<p>With years of experience in betting compliance, Chambers is a highly capable individual who will greatly benefit Smarkets’ team. In his role as the Smarkets CCO, Chambers will work with the rest of the management team to ensure that the company’s operations are in line with the regulatory rules of the US and European markets.</p>
<p>Chambers Likes Smarkets’ Drive for Innovation</p>
<p>Chambers revealed that he has followed Smarkets for some time. He shared that the work of its team and the culture of Smarkets’ business are something that has left a lasting impression on him. Chambers explained that their feats are disproportionately big, considering the company’s size and funding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chambers is delighted to see that Smarkets is one of the rare companies that not only preach innovation but actually practice it.</p>
<p>Chambers then talked about Smarkets’ business and its future. According to him, there are tremendous opportunities for expansion in the US market. Since the country lifted the ban on sports betting in 2018, numerous states have begun opening their own markets. Those fresh markets are waiting to be explored and offer tons of opportunities to the operators who wish to explore them.</p>
<p>Back in April, Smarkets scored a single-event betting volume record during the Grand National race in the UK. With such success on the European market, the company turned its gaze to the US.</p>
<p>In June, Smarkets received a significant investment from SIG-affiliated investment fund Susquehanna Growth Equity. The investment envisions growing the brand in both the European and American markets. The company was bullish to double down on its efforts in the US.</p>
<p>Chambers added that there are also lots of opportunities for development in mature markets as well. He is sure that Smarkets’ creativity and drive for innovation can improve client experience in both Europe and the US.</p>
