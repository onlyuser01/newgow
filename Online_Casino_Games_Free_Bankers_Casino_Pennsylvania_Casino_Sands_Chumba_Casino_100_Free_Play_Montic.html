<p>The leading gaming and entertainment company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced plans for changes to its senior leadership team. The company revealed Thursday that its current Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Tim Rishton, confirmed his plans to retire at the end of 2024. Overall, he was a part of the company for nearly three decades.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the announcement about Rishton's upcoming retirement, IGT revealed that his role will be filled by David Morgan, who currently serves as Vice President and Corporate Controller. While Rishton will retire from IGT at the end of 2024, throughout the year, he will support the transition of responsibilities to Morgan. Effective January 1, 2024, Morgan will assume the role of Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer at IGT.</p>
<p>Max Chiara, IGT's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, discussed the recent senior-level change in a statement. He spoke about Morgan, explaining that he is a seasoned expert with a track record who was also able to accumulate significant knowledge and expertise in technical accounting. "He is a tremendous professional who will have a positive impact on our accounting and tax group, and our broader organization as a member of the leadership team," said Chiara about Morgan.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer added: "On behalf of the leadership team at IGT, I congratulate Tim Rishton on an illustrious career. Tim's leadership, strategic vision, industry knowledge, discipline and integrity will have a lasting influence on our organization." Finally, Chiara said: "Tim has been instrumental in helping drive some of the most significant milestones in the evolution of IGT and its legacy companies."</p>
<p>Throughout his 29-year career with IGT, Rishton played a pivotal role in a number of the company's achievements. He helped the delisting of GTECH from the Borsa Italiana stock exchange, as well as the listing of IGT with the New York Stock Exchange in 2015.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Morgan is also an expert with extensive experience and a unique skill set. He first joined IGT back in 2017. Then, in 2020, he was appointed to the role of Vice President and Corporate Controller. Morgan's responsibilities include overseeing accounting records and the preparation of financial statements, among other strategic financial processes.</p>
