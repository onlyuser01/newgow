<p>Kindred is very selective about its partners but when it does partner with a team, it makes it count</p>
<p>Kindred Group has unveiled a renewal of its funding of Rangers FC’s Team Talk initiative. The program, delivered by the Rangers Charity Foundation, is a mental support initiative directed toward men across the Glasgow area.</p>
<p>The expansion of this agreement reflects Kindred’s commitment to the club. The gambling company serves as the soccer team’s principal sponsor and is dedicated to supporting its athletes and fans. Kindred’s deal with the Rangers is, in fact, the longest-running sponsorship of its kind in British soccer.</p>
<p>The current deal reflects the operator’s targeted sponsorship model that is focused on funding community projects and working closely with Kindred’s partners.</p>
<p>Team Talk is now in its third year. The project has proven to be vastly successful, as attested by the dozens of people it has helped so far. The program has bettered the lives of 117 men in the Glasgow area since its inception and seeks to provide mental support to even more.</p>
<p>Participants in the program can freely discuss their mental health and find support in a safe and welcoming space.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting the Team Talk initiative, Kindred will use the opportunity to promote its Journey to Zero/Zero % Mission on the athletes’ jerseys.</p>
<p>Kindred Is Selective about Its Partners</p>
<p>Connal Cochrane, the chief executive officer of the Rangers Charity Foundation, said that his team is proud of its community initiatives and praised Kindred for its invaluable support. He added that the Rangers Charity Foundation “is a powerful force for good” that continues to reach thousands of people through its community-oriented programs.</p>
<p>The long-running nature of our relationship with Kindred enables us to build strategic support for people in the local community, which in this case is men who may benefit from assistance with their mental health. Connal Cochrane, CEO, Rangers Charity Foundation</p>
<p>Cochrane added that the Rangers Charity Foundation is also thankful to Kindred for its sponsorship of the annual Big Ibrox Sleep Out event.</p>
<p>Kindred Group’s UK head of marketing, Sam Mead, said that his team doesn’t partner with just any clubs. However, when it decides to team up with a team, the operator is always dedicated to providing community funding and support.</p>
<p>In Rangers and Team Talk we have the ideal outlet for this ambition. We’re thrilled with the success of the project to date, and look forward to helping more local men in the months ahead. Sam Mead, UK head of marketing, Kindred Group</p>
<p>Rangers’ new goalkeeper, Jack Butland, recently participated in a Team Talk session and was pleasantly surprised by the program. He said that he felt privileged by the opportunity to talk to other Team Talk participants.</p>
