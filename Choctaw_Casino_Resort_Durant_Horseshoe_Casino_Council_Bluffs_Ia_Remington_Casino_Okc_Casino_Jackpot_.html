    <h1>Choctaw Casino Resort Durant Horseshoe Casino Council Bluffs Ia Remington Casino Okc Casino Jackpot</h1>

<p>The partnership extension builds further the positive momentum gained by the duo and designates them as partners through 2027</p>
<p>The global leader in gaming, International Game Technology (IGT), signed a new contract extension, with the state-owned company operating within the regulated gambling market in Sweden, AB Svenska Spel. Announced Thursday, the new collaboration sees IGT agree to continue to provide its leading video lottery technology and services for Svenska Spel.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, the company will benefit from IGT’s leading solutions, including its central system called INTELLIGEN. The solutions and technology will continue to power the operator’s business which will also be able to leverage IGT’s cashless technology, IGTPay, and many more technological solutions.</p>
<p>The extended contract builds upon an existing partnership between IGT and Svenska Spel. Thanks to the freshly minted extension, the duo agrees to collaborate through January 2027. Keeping in mind IGT’s leadership position within the gambling vertical, further extension of its deal with Svenska Spel is also possible. What’s more, IGT first provided its VLT technology for the company back in 1996. This reaffirms the strength of the duo’s partnership which has been constantly growing over the years.</p>
<p>“IGT and Svenska Spel have a proven approach for serving the Swedish market, and we look forward to building upon that foundation and helping Svenska Spel achieve its growth targets for three additional years.“ Mark MacCombie, SVP EMEA Gaming at IGT</p>
<p>Mark MacCombie, IGT’s SVP EMEA Gaming, shared his excitement about the extended contract with Svenska Spel. He said that IGT is looking forward to the success the collaboration will bring to the duo. Finally, MacCombie explained that the collaboration complements the operator’s goal to offer unique and engaging experiences to its growing customer base thanks to innovative technology and solutions.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow and Expand Its Global Reach</p>
<p>The latest partnership extension with Svenska Spel comes during a busy period for IGT. Only recently, the company confirmed that IGT Global Solutions Corporations, its subsidiary, signed a new deal in Connecticut with the Connecticut Lottery Corporation (CLC). Per the terms of the eight-year deal, IGT agreed to supercharge CLC’s retail and online gambling operations.</p>
<p>Before that, again in the United States, IGT expanded the reach of its wide area progressive (WAP) jackpots. Announced earlier this week, the achievement enabled the company to deliver its WAP jackpots via a Wheel of Fortune slots link for clients in New Jersey. This marked the second such agreement for IGT in North America, allowing the company to expand the reach of its innovative technology.</p>
