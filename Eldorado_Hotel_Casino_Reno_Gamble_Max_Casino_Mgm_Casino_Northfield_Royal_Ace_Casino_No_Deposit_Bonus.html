<p>Fruits Deluxe review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fruits Deluxe is a flashy fruit machine style slot. Although, unlike the fruit machines of the past, this slot comes with far more features and variations on standard play.</p>
<p>At the level of thematic design, however, this slot is as square as they come. The bells, bars, melons, cherries and sevens are a bit shinier and have a more three dimensional art style, but at its heart Spinomenal's Fruits Deluxe slot is going for the well-established world of the one armed bandito.</p>
<p>This works quite well, the modernisation is subtle and stylish in the way few slot machines in this genre are.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are of excellent quality, which only partly makes up for the fact that they are not really showing much imagination or style. The motto here seems to be less is more. The reels are plain, the art and backgrounds simple. As a result, there is a classy, timeless visual style.</p>
<p>Where Fruits Deluxe really pops is in its animations. Everything from the click of a button to the multistage bonus games comes with a carefully designed animation that puts everything in motion without getting busy.</p>
<p>After that, it is almost disappointing that the music is just good, rather than great to match the visual designs. Despite this, the music does its job, sets a mood, and doesn’t irk the player too much.</p>

<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>If graphics are the strongest part of Fruits Deluxe because it knows where to keep it simple and where to add some flare, then that goes double for the gameplay.</p>
<p>The base game is a five reel slot with three rows and twenty five win lines. So far, so simple.</p>
<p>But the base game also plays out with a series of features that make every spin a small adventure. After the initial click of the spin button, the player might get a random multiplier or additional Wilds. Coupling this with the interesting Bonus system, the gameplay on Fruits Deluxe is excellent (see below for more details on Wilds and Bonuses).</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol and pays out the same as the highest value symbol if you get five on a winline.</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol lights up the reel it is on. A counter on that reel records the bet per spin of the round in which the reel was lit up. This effect stays in place until the Bonus Game is triggered. The Bonus Game is triggered by lighting up all five reels and is played with an average of the five counters on those reels.</p>
<p>When triggered, the Bonus Game begins with a wheel on which three spins are awarded. These three spins on the wheel award either a multiplier or a number of free spins. The total multiplier won during these spins is then applied to the average value on the counter. This calculation determines the player’s immediate cash prize. The number of free spins determines how many free spins you get.</p>
<p>If the number of free spins is higher than zero, the Free Spin Bonus is triggered. During the Free Spin Bonus, winning combinations will trigger a respin feature in which the winning combination is locked in place and the rest of the symbols are respun. This continues until a re-spin adds no new winning symbols.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€250 per spin. This will cover all but the lowest of bet size preferences.</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.06%. This is almost a full percentage point lower than our yardstick for average of roughly 96% and so is rather poor.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is also low, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies which favour maximising volatility wherever possible.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>A return to player of 95.06% and low volatility would usually be sufficient to block a game from any kind of recommendation on this site.</p>
<p>However, Fruits Deluxe does enough right at the gameplay and visual levels that for those players who are unconcerned about any of the financial aspects of slot play, you may find something to love in this slot.</p>
<p>On the whole though, best left alone.</p>
