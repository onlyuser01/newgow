    <h1>Wild Horse Casino Arizona Silver Nugget Casino Casino Portugal Casino In Boston Fallsview Casino Res</h1>

<p>Dear Jarmo,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your negative experience.</p>
<p>I have checked Responsible Gaming section, and this is what I found https://www.duxcasino.com/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>"HOW CAN I LIMIT MY SPEND OR LOSSES?</p>
<p>To assist you in gambling responsibly we offer the Personal Limits feature. You can set limits on the amount you deposit, lose, wager, spend in one game, or on your account activity on the whole. This functionality can be accessed within your account in the "Personal Limits" section here.</p>
<p>Limits can be amended at any time. A decrease in the limit will take effect immediately, however an increase may only occur after email confirmation and only after the previous limit of the same type expires, in order to avoid rash decisions. If you require further information or assistance regarding Personal Limits, please contact our support team at support@luck.com."</p>
<p>"NEED A BREATHER?</p>
<p>Cooling-Off Limit. You can set a Cooling-Off Period for 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, or 6 months. While the limit is active you cannot deposit to the Casino and you will be excluded from all promotional offers, although you may withdraw the remaining funds during this period. Cooling-Off period is applied to your account immediately. Upon its expiring your account will automatically be re-activated.</p>
<p>Self-Exclusion Limit. You can set a Self-Exclusion Limit for 6 months, 9 months, or 1 year. Upon doing so your Player Account will immediately be disabled and you will be excluded from all promotional offers for the set period. You will not be able to deposit or withdraw funds when the limit is active. Upon its expiring your account will not be automatically re-activated."</p>
<p>Is this the email address that you have sent your email to? support@luck.com</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
