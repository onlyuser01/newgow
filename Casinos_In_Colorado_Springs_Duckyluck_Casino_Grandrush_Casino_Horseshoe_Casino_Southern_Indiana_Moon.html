<p>Jackpocket, the first third-party app in the US, announced a new exclusive branding partnership. On Wednesday, the company revealed that it expanded its collaboration with the leading NHL team, the New York Islanders. The terms of the new branding collaboration celebrate the team's 50th Anniversary season.</p>
<p>Under the recent branding agreement, Jackpocket was named the Official Home Helmet Partner of the team. The collaboration applies for the 2022-23 hockey season. As a result, Jackpocket will benefit from permanent branding during all of the team's regular season and playoff home games.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jackpocket will benefit from brand exposure at UBS Arena. The brand will be visible on the LED rings for all New York Islanders' home games at the UBS Arena. At the same time, the "Jackpocket Radio Booth" will broadcast live all of the team's home games.</p>
<p>Celebrating the recently expanded collaboration with the leading team, Jackpocket introduced a special promotion. Fans can receive a free lottery ticket celebrating the partnership by entering a code "ICE" at checkout.</p>
<p>Focusing on player engagement, Jackpocket will also offer unique experiences for fans. During home games, sports fans will have the chance to participate in 40 concourse activations, granting them a chance to win merchandise. Jackpocket explained that the newly expanded deal will offer sports fans an opportunity to "win suite level UBS Club and UBS Arena ticket experiences and a variety of additional Islanders prizes and merchandise through giveaways via the app."</p>
<p>Jon Ledecky, the New York Islanders' co-owner, revealed in a statement that the team is thrilled to continue its successful collaboration with Jackpocket. He pointed out that it is exciting to see the brand as the team's official home helmet sponsor for the long-anticipated 50th anniversary season. In conclusion, Ledecky said: "Jackpocket is a trusted partner, and we could not be more excited for the ways that we are working together to evolve our digital and game day experiences for our loyal fans."</p>
<p>Peter Sullivan, Jackpocket's CEO and founder, added: "The Islanders are such a true-blue (and orange!) New York institution, which makes us elated to announce our continuing partnership." He acknowledged that being the official digital lottery courier for all of the team's live events at UBS Arena makes Jackpocket proud. Last but not least, Sullivan said that the company is looking forward to "providing an easy way to order lottery tickets from the convenience of a smartphone for all fans and visitors to the arena."</p>
