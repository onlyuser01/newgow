    <h1>Porterville Casino Casino South Carolina Couer D Alene Casino Sunscape Curacao Resort Spa Casino Cas</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru Team,</p>
<p>unfortunately I have another problem with a casino, this time Slotwolf from N1 Interactive.</p>
<p>I took advantage of the welcome offer with 100% bonus and 100 free spins spread over 5 days of 20 games.</p>
<p>I lost the deposit and the bonus, but won €2.85 with the free spins, with a wager of €128.25.</p>
<p>I made the wager and in the end there were €70 in my account, which I was able to pay out. However, the withdrawal was rejected and only €30 was credited to my account.</p>
<p>The casino says there is a maximum cashout of €30 on free spins. There is nothing in the terms and conditions!</p>
<p>It says the following there:</p>
<p>"2.1 STANDARD WELCOME PACKAGE</p>
<p>2.1.1 First deposit bonus</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To receive the bonus, you must make a deposit of 20 EUR / 20 USD / 30 CAD / 200 NOK / 30 NZD / 100 PLN / 2000 RUB / 3000 JPY / 100 BRL / 1500 INR / 7500 HUF / 300 ZAR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bonus makes 100% of the deposit amount. The maximum bonus amount is 100 EUR / 100 USD / 250 CAD / 1500 NOK / 250 NZD / 500 PLN / 10,000 RUB / 15,000 JPY / 500 BRL / 8500 INR / 40,000 HUF / 2000 ZAR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player wants to get 25 free spins per day for 4 days (100 free spins in total).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonus and free spins must be wagered 45 times before the player can order a withdrawal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free spins must be activated within 24 hours after receiving."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>continue:</p>
<p>"6.1 NO DEPOSIT FREESPINS</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No Deposit Free Spins are defined as free spins which are issued in the following ways including but not limited to: no deposit bonuses, tournament prizes, special promotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum withdrawable amount which has resulted as a winning from any no deposit issued free spins, unless otherwise specified in Terms and Conditions of a specific promotion is determined by customer's VIP level at the moment of free spins result has occurred:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No level: 30 EUR / 30 USD / 45 CAD / 300 NOK / 45 NZD / 150 PLN / 3000 RUB / 4000 JPY / 150 BRL / 2500 INR / 11,000 HUF / 500 ZAR."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and:</p>
<p>"6.2 DEPOSIT FREESPINS</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deposit Free Spins are defined as free spins which are issued as a part of deposit bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum withdrawable amount which has resulted as a winning from any deposit free spins, unless otherwise specified in Terms and Conditions of a specific promotion is not limited to any amount."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I have kept to the terms and conditions, but the casino has not and painfully refuses to pay me the €40 difference.</p>
<p>So I need your help again.</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>
<p>Dennis</p>
