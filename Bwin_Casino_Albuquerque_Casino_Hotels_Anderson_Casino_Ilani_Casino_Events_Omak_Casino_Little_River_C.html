<p>1X2 Network, a UK-based independent software company with decades of experience within the gaming industry, announced it has gone live in Ontario. On Tuesday, the company revealed that Ontarians can now access its casino content via 888casino, the leading online casino brand that is a part of 888 Holdings plc.</p>
<p>Ontarians Can Now Access Games from 1X2 Network</p>
<p>To go live in Ontario, 1X2 Network needed to secure a license from the gambling regulator in the province, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). It was back in May when the company secured its license allowing it to roll out its content.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 888casino needed an AGCO license as well to launch its services in the province. The leading online casino brand was among the first operators to secure a license in Ontario. This enabled 888casino to go live with the opening of the regulated gambling market in the province which happened in April.</p>
<p>Besides 1X2 Network’s popular casino games, the new collaboration with 888casino will also bring content from Iron Dog Studio, 1X2’s sister brand. Thanks to the latest launch, Ontarians can now enjoy smashing hits like Megaways Jack, Pirate Kingdom Megaways, 1 Million Megaways BC and Wolf Strike.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Expands 888casino’s Offering</p>
<p>Talya Benyamini, 888casino’s VP B2C casino, revealed that the collaboration with Iron Dog Studio and 1X2 Network helps expands its offering. At the same time, she pointed out that joining forces with leading game developers is a part of 888casino’s content leadership and product strategy.</p>
<p>“Partnering with leading games suppliers such as 1X2 Network and Iron Dog Studio, which are creating some of the most interesting and engaging content in the casino space, is a key part of our product and content leadership strategy.“ Talya Benyamini, VP B2C casino at 888casino</p>
<p>Benyamini pointed out that besides expanding 888casino’s offering, the collaboration with 1X2 Network will deliver new experiences for customers of the brand in Ontario. Finally, she added that the company is looking forward to the success and exciting experiences the collaboration will bring.</p>
<p>Rory Kimber, 1X2 Network’s account management and marketing director, added that the company remains focused on expanding the reach of its products to new markets. With that in mind, he added that 1X2 Network is adamant about complying with the regulations while at the same time offering best-in-class localized gambling entertainment. Finally, Kimber said: “There is so much potential in this market, and it is very exciting that our games are reaching a new audience in Ontario, thanks to our partnership with 888casino.”</p>
<p>Ontario is Canada’s most populous and largest province. It was the first province in the country to regulate online gambling activities and holds significant potential to become one of the leading regulated gambling markets in North America.</p>
