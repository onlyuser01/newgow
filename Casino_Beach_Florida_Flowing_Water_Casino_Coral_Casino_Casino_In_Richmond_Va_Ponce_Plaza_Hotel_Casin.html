    <h1>Casino Beach Florida Flowing Water Casino Coral Casino Casino In Richmond Va Ponce Plaza Hotel Casin</h1>

<p>Hello. This letter is an official complaint to the casino https://www.betitall.com/en. On December 23, I wanted a withdrawal from the Betittail casino. This was my first withdrawal request at this casino. On December 24, I received a letter that my account was blocked due to a duplicate account. Also casino attached to the letter are photos of my driver's license and receipts for electricity.</p>
<p>Firstly, verification was not started. The casino did not make document requests. Second, I never attached documents on the casino website as indicated in the letter. And didn't send documents by e-mail. I attach all the evidence in screenshots to this letter.</p>
<p>Documents referenced by casino employees I sent a few days ago to another casino. https://www.tsars.com/ I didn't send those documents to anyone else. I was shocked that the casino https://www.betitall.com/en using my documents I did not give Betittail these documents, so their use is illegal. Casino Tsars and Casino Betittail are owned and operated by different companies, as indicated in their licenses.</p>
<p>Betittail uses the data and documents I sent to another casino improperly. Casino Tsars disclosed my personal data, this violated the confidentiality agreement. Therefore, I am also sending a complaint to Tsars Casino. Casino Betittail uses personal data that I did not provide at the casino. The casino cannot refer to documents that are obtained illegally. Moreover, the casino does not have the right to block the account on the basis of these documents. On the basis of the above, the charge of duplicating the account is invalid.</p>
<p>I'm asking you to figure out how my documents got into another casino system.</p>
<p>Betittail Casino please perform regular verification</p>
<p>Please allow my funds to be withdrawn from my Betittail account</p>
<p>Otherwise, I will be forced to report a leak of personal data to the press.</p>
