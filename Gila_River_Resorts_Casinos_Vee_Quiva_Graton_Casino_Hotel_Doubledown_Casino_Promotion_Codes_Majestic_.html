    <h1>Gila River Resorts Casinos Vee Quiva Graton Casino Hotel Doubledown Casino Promotion Codes Majestic</h1>

<p>This is why this casino has a bad reputation so they want my money right there and now but I cashed out oct 19th at 7 am now it is nov 13th 2022 720pm, that’s a total of 25 days I repeat 25 and half days, still no money and after they stoled 200 from my account they completed whatever scam they got going on. Then they tell me this I have to wait additional 5 *business days correct me if I am wrong but isn’t the Bitcoin market 24 hours a day? And check this out I deposited two times and got it there faster then twenty mins for both but when I want my money I get scammed and still waiting for 25 days that’s how this company does business with its customers just excellent service everyone loves to wait almost a month to get paid there winnings said no one in this world this has been my worse experience ever in the history of my life and I still don’t believe I’ll even get paid because I think these scammers are going to do something else with my money I bet you anything something dramatic will happen just watch I’ll keep you updated there Bitcoin machines sent it to the wrong address or something else just watch and I don’t care what anyone says this is my experience this is what I am going through and this is how I feel about the whole situation patient or not it’s ridiculous so I hope everyone can read this so they can understand what it is like to do business with these people so they can make there own call if they decide to do business with these crooks and like I said I’ll post one more time after this to let you know if they even paid me my money don’t hold your breath because I ain’t I would hate to be a employee there that’s for sure have to lie and steal from people. Wonder how long they have to wait to get paid a year? Lol 😂 maybe two years of they get it direct deposited. All I can say is if you want to get paid this year I wouldn’t play here that’s for sure but if you don’t mind waiting for a month then this is your place but i can’t even guarantee if you will get paid yet because i am still waiting. 25 days and counting yeah it makes me mad because they wanted my money right there and then and when I want my money oh yeah about that. And the above pictures maybe they should tell people no matter what you can’t cash out ten times your bet because that’s basically what it said. That said no matter what there taking out 200 for the bonus right? Which would leave me 300 when o won my money I had just about 1500 dollars right with additional 100 spins worth a dollar a spin right? Now check this out hear me out if I had alll that money right and I cashed out 500 and I was talking to this rep guy and he said congratulations on your win and told me the most I can cash out is 500 because that’s the max cash out I can do right so what did I do I cashed out 500 and the remaining 989 dollars and the 100 spins were still there right and that rep said that’s yours to play you can’t cash that out it’s dead money so I played it but I didn’t play it for six days but before I played it I asked again to a different rep and he said basically the same thing that’s after six days I cashed out I still had all 989 dollars and 100 spins so what gets me is how am I suppose to cash out 500 dollars which they said I can do but still take away 200 of my money ?so tell that company to get there mistakes correct because there rules are retarded basically false advertisement because how can I cash out ten times my buy in when you can’t actually cash it out that’s a lie that’s called false advertising so who ever is running this company needs to go back to school 🏫 and re learn the third grade and maybe the fourth grade on how to write ✍️ and add basic math because clearly it’s false advertising I can’t and don’t understand what this means someone enlighten me on what that means? Because it says I can cash out ten times my money right ? But I get penalized 200 dollars even though I had 989 dollars extra and 100 spins at a dollar spin I still get penalized did I read that correctly then ? So what don’t they just make it easier and say cash out is 6 times your buy in? Wouldn’t that be more common sense to write ✍️? Because that’s basically what has happen I ain’t dumb and I ain’t stupid. So don’t play me as a fool maybe they should re write there dumb rules that would make more sense to me and the whole world 🌎 why throw in all this unnecessary writing about bonus money etc be simple to write cash out 6 times your deposit but get a bonus of 200 extra so making it 250 total and I forgot the ridiculous playthrough 100 grand or one million dollars lol 😂 basically that’s what it feels like to actually play through it but that’s not how it was explain to me whatever the case may be ingot lied to and stoled from and that’s how I look at it and see it period. That’s why I had it with these people I was actually going to play again there but after stealing 200 from me and making me wait this long and still no money 💴 what would u do</p>
