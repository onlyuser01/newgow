<p>Stakelogic continues to build its European footprint with the company establishing a new content partnership with Betclic, a prominent regional brand. The partnership will specifically cover the operator’s business in Portugal and bring a series of outstanding games by the studio to local audiences.</p>
<p>To help deliver the games, Stakelogic will see iSoftBet offer its integration services that cover the supplier’s classic and video games and slots. Stakelogic is a studio that has become synonymous with innovation and creating advanced and reliable products that have won players from the world over.</p>
<p>Classic titles such as Runner 8 Runner, Mega Runner, Super 6 Timer, Super Bonus Wild, and others will all be featured as part of the Betclic portfolio in Portugal. There are even more titles for players to enjoy, and they include Greedy Fox, Bison Blocks, Treasures of Ra and so on.</p>
<p>Stakelogic and Betclic are also excited about the opportunity to see more releases together, including upcoming games such as Candyways Bonanza 3 Megaways and Eric’s Big Catch. Stakelogic Senior Sales Manager Danila Dzehs has welcomed this new opportunity to see the supplier’s games rolled out in yet another jurisdiction and with a prominent local operator at that.</p>
<p>Dzehs said that Betclic players will stand to benefit from the variety of existing and upcoming releases by Stakelogic. "We are delighted to have added Betclic to our growing roster of partners, and to expand our presence in Portugal via this deal," Dzehs said, adding that the turbo-charged gameplay of the company’s titles will provide players with what they have come to expect.</p>
<p>Betclic Head of Casino Geoffroy Villiot has welcomed the opportunity to see his company strengthen its library of games in Portugal. Villiot said that the partnership meant that Betclic could add more variety and quality to the brand’s lobby, including the famed and player-favorite Spin to Win and Super Stakes game features.</p>
<p>This new partnership comes in the context of a string of successful collaborations for Stakelogic. The company has been growing in Europe as well as the United States. Recently, Stakelogic launched its live dealer games with Bally’s Corporation.</p>
<p>Apart from iGaming, Betclic has been scaling up its presence in the sports betting vertical. The company became the Official betting Partner for the Ultimate Fighting Championship in three European countries, including Poland, Portugal, and France last month.</p>
