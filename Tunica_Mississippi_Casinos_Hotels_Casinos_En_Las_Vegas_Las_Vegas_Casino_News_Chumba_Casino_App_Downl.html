    <h1>Tunica Mississippi Casinos Hotels Casinos En Las Vegas Las Vegas Casino News Chumba Casino App Downl</h1>

<p>This exciting new slot isn’t for the faint of heart, Stuart McCarthy, head of product and programs at Yggdrasil, said</p>
<p>Yggdrasil, a leading publisher of online casino games, has launched a demonic new game with the fearsome title Devour the Weak. The new release is centered on demons from hell that cast hexes to multiply the players’ winnings.</p>

<p>Embark on a Journey to Hell</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s new game is a 5×3 slot with many innovative mechanics. Players will collect symbols representing letters and demons to increase their multiplier and trigger free spins.</p>
<p>What makes Devour the Weak so special is that every time the reels land on a payline, all winning symbols will be destroyed, along with all symbols of equal or lesser value – thus the game’s name. The destroyed symbols will be replaced with new ones, allowing players to score multiple wins per spin.</p>
<p>The destroyable symbols are not the only exclusive mechanic about the game though, as each time players destroy six symbols, their multiplier will increase. However, the multiplier resets each time players start a new spin.</p>
<p>In addition, players will quickly notice that all symbols have a circular shape in their upper part. In some cases, this circle will be glowing in pink, which signifies the so-called hexed symbols. While hexes are usually something bad, Devour the Weak players want to land on as many hexes as possible.</p>
<p>Once destroyed, hexed symbols will turn into wild symbols, making it easier to score additional winning combinations. Furthermore, each time players score a winning combination, a demonic hand on the right will suck in the hex. Once the meter reaches 6, players will earn 10 free spins. Each additional hex during the cascade round will provide an additional free spin.</p>
<p>Players can select the Golden Bet option, which taxes them at 1.5x their normal bet but allows them to start each round with 1/6 hexes needed to initiate free spins mode.</p>
<p>Players Can Earn Demonic Prizes with Free Spins</p>
<p>During free spins mode, players will start at a 6x multiplier that can potentially reach 666x if enough paylines are chained. If a hexed symbol lands in the middle three reels, it will automatically transform into wild symbols, making it easier to score winning combinations.</p>
<p>Players can also land on a special symbol that will award them one additional free spin.</p>
<p>If players don’t like waiting, they can buy free spins (in markets where this is permitted). Players can buy free spins for 100x the bet and start at a 7x multiplier, or if they are feeling lucky, they can pay 666x their bet to start with a 33x multiplier.</p>
<p>Stuart McCarthy, Yggdrasil’s head of product &amp; programs, commented on the new slot:</p>
<p>This exciting new slot isn’t for the faint of heart, with a great theme featuring demonic characters that are beautifully crafted for an immersive experience. We can’t wait to see players devour low-paying symbols and start racking up impressive wins via hexed icons, win multipliers and free spins. Stuart McCarthy</p>
<p>In other news, Yggdrasil recently launched Shadow Raiders, a pirate-themed slot.</p>
