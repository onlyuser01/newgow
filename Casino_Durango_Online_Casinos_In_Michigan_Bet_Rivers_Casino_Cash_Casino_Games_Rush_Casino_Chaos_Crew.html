    <h1>Casino Durango Online Casinos In Michigan Bet Rivers Casino Cash Casino Games Rush Casino Chaos Crew</h1>

<p>Chaos Crew review</p>
<p>Get ready to dive into a murky underworld with Chaos Crew.</p>
<p>Guided by a vicious cartoon cat and an equally terrifying skull, players will explore a realm of dark symbols and ‘90s alternative aesthetics.</p>
<p>Fans of Nirvana might particularly appreciate some of this slot's nods to grunge culture.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Chaos combines moody shades of black and brown with bright pink, blue, and green for a striking visual effect. The graffiti-adorned streets behind the reels appear in monochrome hues, while the reels stand out in the neon colors.</p>
<p>The symbols include a variety of spooky emblems, including an inked skull, a smiley face with exes for eyes, and a mysterious moth. Each of these images has a trippy quality that feels right on theme for Chaos Crew.</p>
<p>The classical piano soundtrack is at odds with every aspect of Chaos Crew’s visual aesthetics. The slow and calm tune would be better suited to a romantic scene in a historical film than this trippy slot’s world. However, the mute button is readily at hand for those who find the music clashes with the vibe.</p>
<p>Though the soundtrack is a little off theme, the bold animation does all the walking to create a rebellious grunge world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Chaos Crew is a five-reel, five-row slot with 15 win lines.</p>
<p>The maximum win for this slot is 10,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Landing 3 Free Spins symbols triggers the Free Spins feature, starting with 3 free spins.</p>
<p>Wherever players land a win during the Free Spins feature, the number of free spins is reset to 3, as monitored on a meter. This means that the Free Spins feature continues until players complete 3 non-winning spins in sequence.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, the player is attempting to collect as many multipliers as possible. To that end, a number of special symbols are in play. These have different effects as follows:</p>
<p>The Sketchy Skull symbol shows a value that is added to the value above its reel. The possible values are +1, +2, +5, +10, and +20.</p>

<p>Throughout the Free Spins feature, there are also a number of non-winning symbols that appear.</p>
