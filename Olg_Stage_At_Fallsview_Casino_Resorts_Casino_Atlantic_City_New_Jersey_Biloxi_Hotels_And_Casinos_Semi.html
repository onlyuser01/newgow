    <h1>Olg Stage At Fallsview Casino Resorts Casino Atlantic City New Jersey Biloxi Hotels And Casinos Semi</h1>

<p>CTInteractive, the prominent supplier and developer of casino games, continues to march on in Latin America, a region that is expanding rapidly with its regulated iGaming market. Now, CT Interactive will be able to offer its products to players at Betmexico and strengthen its own as well as the brandâ€™s presence in Latin America.</p>
<p>The website operates in Mexico and presents the supplier with many opportunities to improve its ties with local audiences. There will be more games than the initial ones launching with Betmexico as well, confirmed CT Interactive Director of Business Development Americas Martin Ivanov.</p>
<p>He was joined by the Head of Business Development LatAm, Diego Verano, who was pleased to see that the content is already being well-received in the country.</p>
<p>Betmexico Director of Commercial Patricio Garza was equally excited about the opportunity to see the supplier roll out with its award-winning portfolio. "The mission of Betmexico is to provide the best possible gaming experience to its customers. In order to do that, we need to constantly offer new, exciting products," Garza said.</p>
<p>CT Interactive has been working actively to consolidate its position in the Latin American region, and Mexico is definitely one of the most important markets owing to its established tradition in iGaming.</p>
<p>The supplier has been looking to thicken ties with not just individual operators, but also with companies that provide services that are crucial to the overall infrastructure in the region. For example, CT Interactive previously teamed up with Atlas, which supplies iGaming brands with a 360-degree suite of risk management tools and CRM systems among other handy and important options.</p>
<p>Meanwhile CT Interactive has stolen another march on the region by receiving certifications in Buenos Aires, Argentina, positioning the company as a firm and permanent stakeholder in the still-evolving and rapidly developing online casino market in the region.</p>
<p>CT Interactive has similarly grown its footprint in European iGaming markets with rollouts in Montenegro, Italy, and well beyond.</p>
