<p>It may be complicated, but it is transparent and fair."</p>
<p>And one more thing, the games present the user's total balance – of both Cash and Bonus one (namely the balance of the first bonus in line). Thus they see the total amount they can count on to bet.</p>
<p>Another point familiar to many casinos. First, you place bets with funds from the Сash Balance, and when it becomes insufficient for bets, you can bet from the Bonus Balance.</p>
<p>Once the wagering requirements have been met, the amount of winnings, up to the maximum cash out setting, is transferred to the Cash Balance, the remaining amount in the Bonus Balance is reset to zero, and the Bonus Balance is credited with the amount and/or free spins winnings of the bonus redeemed second in line. Then third, forth, fifth, and so on.</p>
<p>Any amount from the Cash Balance can be applied for withdrawal at any time.</p>
<p>All required information, financial history is available on the player's profile. You can cancel any bonus at any time. On request, we provide additional data on bonuses on a 24/7 basis and provide necessary explanations.</p>
<p>We strive to provide players with an enjoyable, smooth, seamless gaming experience and avoid unnecessary intrusive messages of any nature.</p>
<p>Thus, in this case, the player claimed 5 bonuses on October 27 and 29 – 3 NDB and only 2 deposit ones.</p>
<p>Each player can simultaneously redeem any number of bonuses – both deposit and non-deposit ones.</p>
<p>In the T&amp;C of each bonus is now specified, in particular, the maximum cash out, and where you can see your redeemed bonuses (Account section of the Profile, Balance, Bonuses).</p>
<p>Our casino has a technology that allows players, even for a small deposit, to extend their playing time with the possibility of real winnings. For example, deposit 20 CAD and win 60.</p>
<p>But the rules are the same for everyone, they are implemented in the online casino algorithm, and the staff has no influence on them.</p>
<p>We are very sorry that such a vivid and memorable winnings happened to you while playing with bonus funds. Honestly, it is in your case, for many reasons it would be more favorable to us for you to be able to get it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your job and genuine desire to get to the bottom of the issue.</p>
<p>EDIT: Adding an additional response from the casino directed to the player, provided after the complaint closure:</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Slots City Casino Team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>As for more details or game logs - we do not have permission to share anything provided by the casino, so I strongly recommend you ask the casino Customer Support directly about it. They should not have a problem to provide them. If it is a problem, the gaming authority should help you.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru .</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information and also having an internal discussion with the team, unfortunately, we decided to close this complaint as unjustified - considering your play history and that everything was explained in detail above, we do not see any wrongdoing on the casino's side. The casino acted correctly and always, its system amended your balance in accordance with the rules applied based on the type of your balance or bonus winnings. In addition, I also tested it at the casino myself - the details of the balance are easy to check by clicking on the "Balance" button, where it is clear what is the real money balance, and what is the bonus balance. Your screenshot above confirms that you were aware of that.</p>
<p>For some unknown reason, the casino does not reply in the thread, so I would like to provide you with news.</p>

<p>"Dear Branislav,</p>
<p>Thank you for your job and genuine desire to get to the bottom of the issue.</p>
<p>Dear Kezlor,</p>
<p>We are very sorry that such a vivid and memorable winnings happened to you while playing with bonus funds. Honestly, it is in your case, for many reasons it would be more favorable to us for you to be able to get it.</p>
<p>But the rules are the same for everyone, they are implemented in the online casino algorithm, and the staff has no influence on them.</p>
<p>So no more numbers, just explanations.</p>
<p>Seamless Gaming Experience</p>
<p>Our casino has a technology that allows players, even for a small deposit, to extend their playing time with the possibility of real winnings. For example, deposit 20 CAD and win 60.</p>
<p>In the T&amp;C of each bonus is now specified, in particular, the maximum cash out, and where you can see your redeemed bonuses (Account section of the Profile, Balance, Bonuses).</p>
<p>Each player can simultaneously redeem any number of bonuses – both deposit and non-deposit ones.</p>
<p>Thus, in this case, the player claimed 5 bonuses on October 27 and 29 – 3 NDB and only 2 deposit ones.</p>
<p>We strive to provide players with an enjoyable, smooth, seamless gaming experience and avoid unnecessary intrusive messages of any nature.</p>
<p>All required information, financial history is available on the player's profile. You can cancel any bonus at any time. On request, we provide additional data on bonuses on a 24/7 basis and provide necessary explanations.</p>
<p>How it Works</p>
<p>Each user has two balances.</p>
<ol>
<li>A Cash Balance, which may contain:</li>
</ol>
<p>deposits made;</p>
<p>winnings from bets fully placed from the Cash Balance;</p>
<p>bonus amounts, up to the maximum cash out limit, after wagering requirements have been met.</p>
<p>Any amount from the Cash Balance can be applied for withdrawal at any time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bonus Balance, which may contain:</li>
</ol>
<p>the amount of the cash bonus redeemed first in line;</p>
<p>the amount of match bonus, redeemed first in line, within the maximum bonus setting;</p>
<p>winnings from free spins redeemed first in line – no limits;</p>
<p>winnings on bets placed from the Bonus Balance, or combined from the Bonus and Cash Balance.</p>
<p>Bonus Balance funds cannot be directly withdrawn.</p>
<p>Once the wagering requirements have been met, the amount of winnings, up to the maximum cash out setting, is transferred to the Cash Balance, the remaining amount in the Bonus Balance is reset to zero, and the Bonus Balance is credited with the amount and/or free spins winnings of the bonus redeemed second in line. Then third, forth, fifth, and so on.</p>
<p>Another point familiar to many casinos. First, you place bets with funds from the Сash Balance, and when it becomes insufficient for bets, you can bet from the Bonus Balance.</p>
<p>And one more thing, the games present the user's total balance – of both Cash and Bonus one (namely the balance of the first bonus in line). Thus they see the total amount they can count on to bet.</p>
<p>It may be complicated, but it is transparent and fair."</p>
