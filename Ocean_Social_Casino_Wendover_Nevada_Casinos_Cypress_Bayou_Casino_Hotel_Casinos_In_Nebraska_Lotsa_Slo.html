<p>Hi nick this is yakina here,thankyou for replying back to me.this is very frustrating for me as i honestly havent broken any rules with mr bet casino as they are claiming.i only joined up with mr bet casino on the 28/02/23 at 2.05pm.i came acrosd their website through the dashboard on my skrill account and had seen mr bet casino offering a good welcome bonus of 400%for joining up so i did and now i honestly wish i never did!i played through all the wagering requirements etc i then deposited $6,000from my skrill account into mr bet casino.i ended up spending that balance down then they offered me a cashback bonus of $3,400 which was in form of bonus money and the wagering requirements was that i had to make bets of $19,000 until it would become real money which i also did abide by there rules.i then had a balance of $7,000 which put a withdraw request through then they said it was put in a pending status and that i would soon receive an email asking me to upload my i.d and documents for the verification of my account which was their rules so i could withdraw that money.i still received no email and i then ended up playing the balance down to $5,000 and then requested a withdraw once again which they said the same thing to me that had to wait for email back which never came.i then tried to log into my account and found wasnt able to so i managed to talk to one of their live chat team members whose name was mark who advised me that my account is blocked and had been closed also my $5,000 balance taken away due to violation of their rules they claim i have another account with mr bet casino which i deffinantly do not have.i have asked the support managers to send me verification of this but they came back and stated that they reserve the right not to disclose me any information and that they would be happy to help me find my active account they claim i have which i dont.please are you able to help me nick?</p>
