    <h1>Margaritaville Resort Casino New York New York Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Casinos In Reno Nv Free Spi</h1>

<p>Marcelo Loyola, a Great Canadian Rewards member, says he credits his big win entirely to his late girlfriend who passed away suddenly just a few days after he celebrated his 50th birthday</p>
<p>A Toronto-based solutions contractor is now $3.2 million richer after winning a massive progressive jackpot at Casino Woodbine. Loyola shared that Casino Woodbine was a favorite entertainment spot for him and his girlfriend, with her going upstairs to play the slots while he played the tables downstairs.</p>
<p>Man Claims His Late Girlfriend Helped Him Win the Jackpot</p>
<p>Loyola says he felt his girlfriend’s spirit with him when he went to the casino just two weeks after her passing. Although he is a table games player, he decided to play his girlfriend’s favorite slot machine and even played it the way she did, stopping the machine mid-spin to try and get the three ‘Jackpot’ icons to line up. It worked, and Loyola saw ‘Jackpot, Jackpot, Jackpot’ before he started screaming and running around.</p>
<p>The win drew a crowd of onlookers and casino staff who were just as excited as the winner. Loyola shared that a lot of people at the casino knew about his girlfriend’s passing and gave him their condolences and congratulations at the same time. He said it was an incredibly emotional story that was hard for him to tell, but he knew for a fact that his girlfriend was with him that night, and it could not be a coincidence.</p>
<p>Great Canadian Congratulates Loyola on Jackpot Win at Casino Woodbine</p>
<p>Robert Katsavelos, general manager of Casino Woodbine, shared that they are thrilled for Loyola and excited to see him take home such a huge payout, especially after such an emotional time. Katsavelos added that it is an amazing story in so many ways, and they are glad Loyola has chosen to share it with them.</p>
<p>While Loyola is super happy about his win, he wishes his girlfriend were beside him to share it. He plans to buy a new home for his parents, visit his brother and his family in British Columbia, and invest some of the winnings. Loyola shared that he wants to take care of the people he loves, just like he and his girlfriend took care of each other.</p>
<p>Casino Woodbine, which is owned and operated by Great Canadian Entertainment, will soon be transformed into a modern Vegas-style gaming resort experience with the opening of the brand new CAD1 billion ($737.7 million) Great Canadian Casino Resort Toronto this summer.</p>
<p>Great Canadian Entertainment, founded in 1982, is Canada’s premier gaming and hospitality company with 25 gaming, entertainment, and hospitality facilities across Ontario, British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The company is committed to investing in and offering opportunities to people in the communities in which it operates, supporting over 1,400 charitable and non-profit organizations across Canada.</p>
