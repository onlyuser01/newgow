<p>Reel Desire review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This game is themed around a disco club.</p>
<p>Players will be transported to an ‘80s-style world of neon lights and seductive glances. The moody atmosphere and array of glowing symbols will have players vying to take a chance on a dance.</p>
<p>The retro vibe has an alluring nostalgia, even if the world is a fantasy. For players in the mood for a boogie down memory lane, this slot is a fun diversion.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The dreamy soundtrack has an ‘80s electronic vibe and will put players in the mood to dance. It brings to mind soundtracks of films like Flashdance and all the longing that comes from locking eyes across the dance floor. Most players will probably be happy to leave the sound on for the ambiance.</p>
<p>The luminous violet-hued background creates the illusion of a high-ceiled club. The player will feel they are vulnerably standing by the towering reels.</p>
<p>The symbols include a range of nostalgic treasures from high-topped sneakers, lightning bolt crystal earrings and gleaming records shaped like traditional card suits. The animation of these items is cartoonish and lighthearted.</p>
<p>A pair of club-goers also stare out from the reels: a man in shades and a girl adorned with vintage accessories. Both bring to mind a time before Tinder, when asking someone to dance could be the start of a romance.</p>
<p>Overall, this game’s front end creates a romantic club mood.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Reel Desire is a five reel, four row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing three matching symbols of any kind on a minimum of 3 consecutive reels.</p>
<p>The gameplay is rhythmic and flashy, though slightly slower than the pace of the music. This jars somewhat with the slot’s dance theme.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols.</p>
<p>At random while in the base game, the Reel Desire feature can be triggered. During this feature, 1-5 reels are entirely turned to Wild symbols.</p>
<p>Double Wild symbols stick on the reels, prompt a respin, and give the player a x2 multiplier. The Double Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols. They may only appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 in the base game.</p>
<p>Player can choose between 2 variants of the Free Spins feature</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land a minimum of 3 Free Spin symbols, which awards 10 spins. More Free Spin symbols mean greater additional wins:</p>
<p>4 symbols - x50 total bet</p>
<p>5 symbols - x500 total bet</p>
<p>Sticky Wild symbol in the free spins feature</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96%, bang on our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€75 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is on the high end of medium, which makes it a middling match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for high paying symbols of the game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this average RTP, high-medium volatility disco themed slot.</p>
<p>Despite its immersive front end, this game’s mathematical profile is pretty average with middling RTP and volatility.</p>
<p>However, the club atmosphere is executed entertainingly and creates a compelling sense of the world.</p>
<p>Players may enjoy stopping by this slot for a dance or two, but they’d do better to move on to games where their bets will pack more punch.</p>
