    <h1>Hooters Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Casino At Marina Bay Sands Download Free Casino Games Hard Rock S</h1>

<p>Hi team. I go by the username bowsoocles on BitDice. I’ve used this site for many years, made many deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>I completed the sites KYC requirements earlier this year.</p>
<p>Recently I made a deposit of approx 5 LTC which I lost. As part of the offers to players, the casino offered me a 100% bonus so after I lost my real-time funds I switched to bonus funds where I met their wagering requirement of 35 x my initial deposit.</p>
<p>Once this was moved to my real-time balance, I requested a withdrawal to my regular wallet on Tuesday 15/12 at 15:10 AEST. I received my email to verify the withdrawal and clicked confirm to withdraw 17.8 LTC less any transfer fees. This amount was taken out of my balance and I was happy to wait up to the standard 72 hours the site claims it takes to process.</p>
<p>On Thursday 17/11 I went to log into the site only to discover my account had been deactivated (without any knowledge or communication from the site).</p>
<p>i have tried contacting the site through their online support but have never received a response.</p>
<p>i have also emailed the site at the following emails and am still awaiting a response as to what happened:</p>
<p>elon@bitdice.me</p>
<p>contact@bitdice.me</p>
<p>I’ve even tried to contact them through their twitter page.</p>
<p>can you please help</p>
