<p>The Players Championship Odds: Spieth, McIlroy, Day Top List, Tiger, and Phil Lurk</p>

<p>The Players Championship tees off Thursday at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, where oddsmakers feel Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, and Jason Day will battle for golf’s so-called fifth major.</p>

<p>The Westgate SuperBook has all three superstars at 14/1 to win The Players. Spieth’s grouping with the shortest odds of the 144-man field comes as a bit of a surprise considering he’s missed three consecutive cuts at TPC Sawgrass.</p>
<p>“The first year I played here I almost won it, and so I just kind of assumed that it would come easy to me,” Spieth said of his T4 performance in 2014. “The last couple of years … I haven’t approached it like I approach the major championship-caliber golf, and this golf course and this tournament are major championship-caliber.”</p>
<p>McIlroy and Day have enjoyed plenty of success at The Players.</p>
<p>Day, who enters fresh off a win at the Wells Fargo, won The Players Championship in 2016. McIlroy finished T8 in 2013, T6 in 2014, T8 in 2015, T12 in 2016, and T38 last year.</p>
<p>2017 Players champ Si Woo Kim is getting little respect despite some recent good play. Kim is at 80/1 to defend.</p>
<p>Woods Attracts Action</p>
<p>Tiger Woods’ season got off to a blistering, unexpected start. He followed up a 12th-place finish at The Honda Classic with two top-five performances (T2 Valspar, T5 Arnold Palmer Invitational).</p>
<p>But after disappointing play at the Masters (T32) and Wells Fargo (T55), Woods’ game has seemingly taken a step backwards. That isn’t stopping sports bettors from going forward with the 14-time major champ.</p>
<p>Woods is at 30/1 to win The Players, tied for the 10th-shortest line. His Thursday and Friday playing partner Phil Mickelson shares the 30/1 line. The third competitor in their group, Rickie Fowler, is shorter at 16/1.</p>
<p>Fowler won The Players in dramatic fashion in 2015 when he played the final four holes -5, and then won in a playoff against Kevin Kisner and Sergio Garcia.</p>
<p>After the three-way tie at the top, Fowler is the next shortest at the SuperBook with Justin Thomas and Dustin Johnson. Jon Rahm is next at 20/1, followed by Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson (25/1).</p>
<p>Masters champ Patrick Reed shares Woods and Mickelson’s 30/1 line.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Loves Tiger</p>
<p>Tiger Woods hasn’t won a PGA Tour event since 2013, the same year he won his second Players Championship. For Las Vegas oddsmakers, his victory drought has netted big wins for casinos in recent months.</p>
<p>Woods in a tournament always increases interest, and subsequently total handle. The SuperBook said the 2018 Masters, Tiger’s first trip around Augusta National since 2015, set a new betting record.</p>
<p>Woods chalks up his constantly short odds to “gamble-oholics.“</p>
<p>Reed’s victory last month was an ace for Las Vegas. The longshot, who entered the Masters at 40/1 odds, generated little interest. The most money was on Woods, McIlroy, and Dustin Johnson. Reed wasn’t in the top 10 of ticket count or money wagered.</p>
