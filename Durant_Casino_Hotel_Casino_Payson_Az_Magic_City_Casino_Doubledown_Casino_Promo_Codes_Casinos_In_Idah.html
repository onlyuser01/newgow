<p>According to TMZ, the rapper, whose birth name is Willie Maxwell II, was charged with misdemeanors after allegedly striking a valet and two other employees of the Strip resort.</p>
<p>He spent a few hours in police custody before being released. According to court records, his next appearance is set for 8 a.m. PT Oct. 31 before Judge Diana Sullivan.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officers did not reveal much information to reporters and did not specifically mention the Mirage in their statement, only saying the business was near the 3400 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard, the street address for the MGM casino.</p>
<p>About Fetty</p>
<p>Fetty, 28, was born with glaucoma. That condition led to him losing his left eye at an early age, which is why he wears a prosthetic eye, according to media reports.</p>
<p>As a rapper, he burst on the scene nearly five years ago with his first single “Trap Queen.” The song reached seven-times platinum status in the US and finished 2015 as the No. 2 song on the US Hot R&amp;B year-end chart and No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart.</p>
<p>His self-titled debut studio album reached No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard R&amp;B/Hip-Hop album lists. He’s also performed on songs by Selena Gomez, Migos, and Gwen Stefani.</p>
<p>It does not appear that the incident will keep Fetty from a 20-date, month-long European tour that kicks off Wednesday. The first stop will be in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>This apparently wasn’t Fetty’s first brush with the law. TMZ reported back in June that a woman accused the rapper of assaulting her at an Airbnb rental after a video shoot in Los Angeles. A video the news site obtained showed the camera pointed at Fetty in a bedroom, with a female voice off-screen telling him to do it again.</p>
<p>As he walks toward the camera, he is seen smacking it out of the operator’s hand. It does not appear that Fetty was charged in that matter.</p>
<p>In March 2018, he made a deal with prosecutors in Brooklyn to avoid jail time in a driving under the influence case dating to November 2017. Media reports indicated he surrendered his driver’s license for 90 days and agreed to take an impaired driving course.</p>
<p>Fetty also isn’t the first rapper to have issues at a Vegas casino. In July 2018, YG surrendered to Las Vegas authorities after they issued a warrant for his arrest after a fan claimed the rapper and his entourage attacked him in an incident that occurred two months before. The fan, who said he was denied a selfie, claimed the rapper ripped off his gold chain and had members of his entourage hit him.</p>
<p>In late May, the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas created headlines when it kept Meek Mill from entering the resort and attending a DJ Mustard concert. Initially, casino officials said they did so because of the Philadelphia artist got into a fight during a prior visit to the casino, a claim his attorney denied.</p>
<p>A week later, the casino issued an apology.</p>
