    <h1>Horseshoe Casino Bossier Wildwood Casino Cripple Creek Casablanca Resort Hotel And Casino Hotels At</h1>

<p>I made a withdrawal request on may 31/05/22 of Â£500 I'm still waiting on this today June 13/06/22</p>
<p>I have messaged several times to the casino support and they state my withdrawal is being processed and that it has already been credited to my account and will show in upcoming business days but I have had this since last week from them and then sent another email yesterday with no replies.</p>
<p>Can I ask any of you who have been on here how long it took for you to get your withdrawal? If any? As it states swift transfers are upto five business days but it's well over this?! Can anyone help please??? Or is this site a total scam??!! Regards</p>
