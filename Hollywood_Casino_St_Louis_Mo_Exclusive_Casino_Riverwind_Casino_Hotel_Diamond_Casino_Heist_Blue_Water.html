<p>Online lottery provider theLotter announced today an expansion of its services into Minnesota by launching its dedicated theLotter Minnesota website.</p>
<p>theLotter Minnesota Website Is Now Live</p>
<p>The launch of theLotter Minnesota website provided online lottery players in the state a chance to play Minnesota Lottery top draw games online, as well as participate in other lotteries such as Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto America, Gopher 5, and Northstar Cash for which theLotter is operating as an independent, secure courier service.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of theLotter Minnesota website, Peggy Daniel, the Lotter’s US Managing Director hailed the launch in the North Star State as a “great milestone” for the company that has been pioneering online lottery play since its inception.</p>
<p>“I am truly excited about the potential for growth in Minnesota and the additional funds we will help provide for local wildlife protection, education, public safety and other causes.” Peggy Daniel, Managing Director, US, theLotter</p>
<p>Daniel then stressed the “convenience and safety” online lottery play offers, outlining the level of trust theLotter customers developed for the company’s services, as “all past winners have successfully claimed their prize money and collected their winnings.”</p>
<p>Transparency Helped Gain Customer’s Trust</p>
<p>Available to Minnesotans via theLotter Minnesota dedicated website, the company offers a host of unique functionalities that are not available in-store such as subscriptions to special multi-draw packages, giving every tenth ticket free, as well as real-time jackpot alerts. But for Daniel, the most important option provided by the website is the opportunity to see a scan of the actual paper ticket a player has purchased.</p>
<p>“When a client wins any prize at all, we notify them,” Daniel continued, clarifying that “winnings of up to $600 are transferred directly to a client’s account,” while “prizes over that amount can be collected in person at offices of the Minnesota Lottery.”</p>
<p>“It’s that level of transparency and security, which has inspired the trust customers have in us. I am certain Minnesotans will embrace our service in a similar fashion.” Peggy Daniel, Managing Director, US, theLotter</p>
<p>Founded in 2002, theLotter operates as a global online lottery ticket purchasing service that offers its customers around the world a chance to play the biggest lottery draws worldwide by physically buying official lottery tickets on their behalf, and scanning and uploading the tickets to the their accounts before the actual draw.</p>
