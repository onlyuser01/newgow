<p>The leading retail and online sports betting company Hollywoodbets plans to increase its presence globally. As a part of its strategic plan, the company expanded its existing collaboration with Chalkline.</p>
<p>Chalkline and Hollywoodbets Expand Collaboration</p>
<p>Looking at boosting its growth in new markets, the leading retail and online sports betting operator Hollywoodbets announced earlier this week that it expanded its collaboration with Chalkline. The partnership expansion builds on an existing long-term collaboration between the duo. For the last three years, Chalkline has powered Hollywoodbets’ freeplay content.</p>
<p>Now, under the new agreement, Hollywoodbets is expected to license Chalkline’s BettorGames platform. This strategic move will bring more freeplay and real money gambling products for Hollywoodbets’ growing audience within existing and new markets. Additionally, the BettorGames platform features real money sports jackpot games, as well as live-in play contests, challenges and personalized match predictions.</p>
<p>The deal comes as a part of Hollywoodbets’ strategic plan to expand its presence across African markets. Moreover, the company looks to expand in the UK, Ireland and other new markets in Europe. Only recently, Hollywoodbets inked a deal with Premier League Brentford Football club, just in time for the 2021-22 season. As a result of the collaboration, the company was named the official betting partner of the club.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets Is an Iconic Gaming Brand</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets’ betting operations manager, Dermot O’Connel revealed that Chalkline’s content is well received by the consumers. He added that the company is delighted to expand its collaboration with Chalkline. In conclusion, O’Connel acknowledged that the new partnership will help Hollywoodbets grow on a global scale.</p>
<p>“Chalkline’s freeplay games have a proven track record across our customer acquisition and retention marketing programs.” Dermot O’Connell, betting operations manager at Hollywoodbets</p>
<p>Chalkline’s CEO and co-founder, Daniel Kustelski, shared his excitement in a statement. He deemed Hollywoodbets “an iconic gaming brand” and added that Chalkline is excited to expand its partnership with them. Kustelski acknowledged that the expanded collaboration will bring real-money games as well as freeplay content to new markets. In conclusion, he outlined that Hollywoodbets’ team is “just fun to work with.”</p>
<p>Only recently, in October, Chalkline inked a similar deal with Covers, the popular sports media outlet. Under the terms of the collaboration, the company agreed to provide freeplay content with a goal to boost customer engagement. Before that, Chalkline inked a key agreement with OfficePools.com. As a result, the Canadian fantasy sports company gained access to Chalkline’s technology.</p>
