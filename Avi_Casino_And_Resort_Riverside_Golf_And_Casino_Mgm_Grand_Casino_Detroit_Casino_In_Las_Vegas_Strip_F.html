    <h1>Avi Casino And Resort Riverside Golf And Casino Mgm Grand Casino Detroit Casino In Las Vegas Strip F</h1>

<p>Hello on Thursday March 2nd I deposited $65 in Prism casino using bonus code "conquest" which was a 200% match and 50 spin bonus. I was very careful to read the rules of this bonus as I have played on similar websites before using similar coupons and I know it can be tricky when time to receive winnings however I proceeded with caution and began to play (slots-an allowed game per rules). I met all my requirements and played through bonus at that point I was up $2500 which I decided to withdrawl most. On Saturday March 4th I decided to withdrawl $2100, at that point $130 was immediately deducted from my account leaving me with about $75 left to play win in was spent. I provided all the information asked and received a notification that the withdrawl was under review. On Monday March 6th I checked the status of my withdrawl (I did not receive any notifications via website or email) when checking the status of my withdrawl, it was no longer listed as pending and in a list of transactions, there was a transaction that state wire withdrawl denied for the $2100 and right above another transaction that stated manager withdrawl requested/and approved for $2100 Also my initial $65 deposited was returned (not knowing I played this amount thinking it was a loyalty bonus) I attempted to call the number provided and it did not work. I contacted someone through chat and I was told that my withdrawl was denied because I played "not allowed games" Now on these sites when bonuses are activated the list of "not allowed games are locked out as there is a picture of a lock and it does not allow you to play these games. My main issue is that I played my bonus through, and when I did so the games that weren’t allowed now magically did not have a lock on them and I was allowed to play My other argument is that I attempted my withdrawl before I began playing any of these "not allowed" games before they were suddenly "allowed" I tried arguing my case to the representatives but they were rude and dismissive and told me the contact number was no longer an active wonder and the only way to contact someone was through chat. Please is very frustrating I’m a hard working person and I just want the right thing done I won this money fair and square and I feel like I am being ripped off my argument is that the games that are considered "allowed should have not been unlocked once my threshold was met if they were truly not allowed It is very misleading to the customer it is similar to having an "open" sign on a business door and when you walk in they say "no we are closed" please hopefully someone can help me regain these winnings or even a portion thank you</p>
