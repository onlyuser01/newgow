<p>High 5 Games has unlocked a new major achievement in the North American market, having obtained a supplier license from the Pennsylvanian Gaming Control Board (PGCB). The company, which develops online and land-based games, has authored a number of impressive titles that are part of its library.</p>
<p>The company has developed many noteworthy titles such as Buffalo Canyon, Lucha Loot, Green Machine Supreme, Hootie’s Fortune, Dragon’s Keeper, Da Vinci Gems, and so many more. Moving forward, High 5 Games will have the opportunity to deploy its exclusive offer on the market in the Keystone State. Operating out of New York, High 5 Games now has the opportunity to launch with partners in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Through the Interactive Gaming Manufacturer License from the PGCB, the supplier will be able to deploy its products with immediate effect and with any party that is authorized to operate in the market and wishes to bolster its portfolio with the company’s distinguished selection of titles. Commenting on this opportunity, High 5 Games CEO Tony Singer said:</p>
<p>"Over a year ago, we developed a plan to invest in North America, expand into every major market, and significantly grow our footprint across the continent."</p>
<p>Singer welcomed this opportunity and said that Pennsylvania is one of the most significant iGaming markets in the United States. As such, it has always been a priority for High 5 Games to secure the keys to the state, and bring fresh entertainment to the players there. While High 5 Games is a prolific developer, the company will have to undergo additional checks as its games need to be approved by the PGCB before they can be launched on the market.</p>
<p>Presently, the PGCB has given the greenlight to 12 games, including Secrets of the Forest, Golden Night, Midnight Eclipse, and Dangerous Beauty. High 5 Games has been building up its presence in the regulated North American market, having secured the appropriate licenses necessary to operate in New Jersey, Michigan, and Connecticut in the United States, and Ontario and Quebec in Canada.</p>
<p>High 5 Game is also one of the oldest developers on the market. The company actually goes back to 1995 when it was originally founded. Over the past two decades, High 5 Games has been hard at work, and it has helped develop more than 500 casino games, making it one of the most prolific North American developers of all times.</p>
