<p>Lady Luck Games unveiled a new agreement with Cbet a few hours after the latter secured content from Betsoft Gaming</p>
<p>Cbet, a casino operator targeting the LATAM region, has further expanded its content offering thanks to an agreement with Lady Luck Games, a fast-growing casino games developer.</p>
<p>Cbet Secures Content from Yet another Provider</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Lady Luck Games will provide the operator with its acclaimed content, allowing it to engage customers with state-of-the-art games. Cbet will be able to offer a huge selection of new titles to its players, including hits such as Astro Anna, Beetle Bailey, Mr Alchemister, SpinJoy Society Megaways, The Treasures of Tizoc and Valholl: Wild Hammers, to name a few.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, Lady Luck Games will be able to engage more gambling enthusiasts in Latin America, thus expanding its ever-growing global presence. The renowned developer has been very busy in recent times, securing many key deals across multiple markets.</p>
<p>For example, in December 2022, Lady Luck Games made a foray into Italy after securing an agreement with Microgame, a leading aggregation platform. Earlier the studio joined Relax Gaming’s Powered by Relax program, further expanding its reach. In November, the company successfully received a UK license for its ReelNRG brand.</p>
<p>Likewise, Cbet has been keen on enhancing its content and cementing itself as a local powerhouse. Last month, the operator penned an important agreement with the French pro soccer club Paris Saint-Germain, under which Cbet became the team’s regional partner for LATAM. Earlier today, on the other hand, Betsoft, another provider of casino content, also agreed to power the LATAM operator with gaming content.</p>
<p>Overall, the agreement between Lady Luck Games and Cbet opens a new chapter in both companies’ respective growth journeys.</p>
<p>The Companies Are Happy to Join Their Forces</p>
<p>Rebecca Sotomora, Cbet’s chief commercial officer, spoke about the new agreement. She said that her team is delighted to add the content of yet another innovative provider to Cbet’s platform. Sotomora praised the studio for its exciting and diverse portfolio and noted that she is certain that Lady Luck Games’ titles will meet the operators’ players’ expectations.</p>
<p>Mads Jørgensen, the co-founder and chief executive officer of LL Lucky Games AB, Lady Luck’s parent company, also shared his thoughts. He expressed his excitement about working with a casino brand as established and trusted as Cbet. According to Jørgensen, the current agreement is yet another major step towards his company’s goal of standing out from its competitors.</p>
<p>Jørgensen concluded that he is glad to reinforce Lady Luck’s presence in the LATAM region. He is looking forward to offering seamless, differentiated and intuitive games to local customers.</p>
