<p>Bryan Contreras, 32, was arrested on an open murder with a deadly weapon charge on June 9 for the 2021 incident.</p>
<p>A recently-released police report revealed the Aug. 23, 2021 deadly shooting of Jesse Poncelet, 32, was intentional, based on a statement from a witness, Las Vegas TV station KLAS reported.</p>
<p>Contreras, his girlfriend, Poncelet, and three others were in a room at the Motel 8 on South Las Vegas Boulevard when a gun discharged and Poncelet fell to the floor. He later died from the wound at University Medical Center.</p>
<p>Autopsy Reveals Homicide</p>
<p>Initially, it was believed the shooting at the motel was an accident. Poncelet’s death was later ruled a homicide following an autopsy by the Clark County coroner’s office, which found that Poncelet died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen.</p>

<p>After the shooting, Contreras allegedly fled from the motel, which is located on South Las Vegas Boulevard near Hacienda Avenue and across from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.</p>
<p>Contreras was later identified and apprehended. Police found out he was a convicted felon, so officers charged him with being a prohibited person in possession of a gun.</p>
<p>Several Court Appearances</p>
<p>At first, Judge Joseph Bonaventure released Contreras on his own recognizance on Aug. 24, 2021. Initially, he refused to speak with Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) detectives about the shooting.</p>
<p>Then, in October 2021, Contreras and his girlfriend were arrested in Laughlin, Nev. Contreras had a pending charge from California on an undisclosed criminal count.</p>
<p>When Contreras didn’t show up for a court hearing on the gun charge, Judge Eric Goodman issued a warrant for his arrest on March 15, 2022. As police further investigated the fatal shooting, another arrest warrant was issued on March 29 by Justice Court Judge Amy Chelini.</p>
<p>Contreras and his unnamed girlfriend were drug addicts, the police report claimed. A drug paraphernalia charge against her is apparently pending.</p>
<p>Contreras appeared in Las Vegas Justice Court on the open murder charge on June 12, and remains in custody at the Clark County Detention Center.</p>
<p>If convicted on the two charges, Contreras could face decades in prison.</p>
