    <h1>Poconos Casinos Rampart Casino Fourwinds Casino Murphy Harrah S Cherokee Valley River Casino Hotel S</h1>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>Based on the updates received from both the casino and the player, we reopened the complaint, and it will updated accordingly – ADR (eCOGRA) decided in favor of the casino. Therefore, the complaint will be closed as unjustified. The player is not entitled to the disputed winnings.</p>
<p>Although it looks like ADR did not look at the way of bonus activation in detail, from our point of view, these are the factors that are against the complainant:</p>
<p>Each player is allowed to accept or refuse the casino’s welcome bonus offer upon registration</p>
<p>It was the player’s obligation to read the Terms and Conditions, where the welcome bonus offer and the related process are clearly explained, while the link to them is available right below the information about the welcome bonus offer</p>
<p>Since the player used the first welcome bonus, it means the welcome bonus was accepted, as well as the casino’s complete Terms and Conditions upon registration</p>
<p>The second deposit bonus was credited immediately, together with a deposit</p>
<p>The balance is always displayed in the up-right corner, showing the entire balance including bonus funds, and the difference between the deposit and the entire balance with the bonus funds in this case was significant, so unmissable</p>
<p>Instead of asking the casino customer support about the difference and extra money in his balance, the player simply started playing with the available balance</p>
<p>Bonuses in the casino work as follows – the bets are deducted from the balance and the winnings are credited to it in the same ratio as the ratio of a received bonus and deposit, which means he played with the bonus funds from the first bet</p>
<p>The player claimed that he does not know when exactly was the bonus in question added to his balance, but he also claimed that the significant winnings were accumulated before the bonus was added…</p>
<p>ADR decided in favor of the casino</p>
<p>Referring to the law and regulations regarding the operation of the casino in his country of residence and threatening further legal action, despite it being the player’s obligatory to read the Terms and Conditions and search for the necessary information before the registration and rules acceptance; he could be glad that he was allowed to play in the casino and used its services, so he rather could take it as an advantage</p>
<p>Under the given circumstances, it would be impossible to prove that the user did not know about the bonus funds being credited to his balance or that he did not accept the casino’s welcome bonus offer</p>
<p>We also tried to find out more about the process of the bonuses and adding them to the accounts, however, unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>Since we were not able to collect any details, we would like to provide the casino with a piece of advice – if it currently does not work like that, we strongly recommend informing the players about adding the welcome bonuses additionally/separately upon making deposits, so the players are fully informed about the bonuses before they are automatically credited to their balances. The ideal way would be to inform the users by pop-ups showing such information, or alternatively, to require choosing an option to confirm or refuse it.</p>
<p>Dear pteissl,</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>Feel free to reply to my last email if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Thank you, Zodiac Casino Team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
