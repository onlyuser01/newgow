    <h1>Hollywood Casino Bangor Casino Arizona Jobs Bay Mills Resort Casino Brimley Mi Green Valley Ranch Re</h1>

<p>Hello, since 10.2 I have been trying to withdraw 2000e from jazzslots.com casino. In the beginning, it was difficult to get Kyc approval, which was finally approved through difficulties. I made a withdrawal request, which received a notification "withdrawal accepted", and then the next day received a notification "withdrawal rejected". Withdrawal requests 15 and rejections 14. The last withdrawal request I made a few days ago is currently still active and the casino's chat "assured that my money will be transferred soon. There have been dozens of promises both in chat conversations and in e-mails. The casino has referred to a problem with the astropay payment intermediary. It does not no, and deposits work well for the casino.</p>
<p>Apparently biamobet casino is related to this because most of the answers come from biamobet.com. This is an exhausting "battle" with them and dozens of promises "we will pay your withdrawals" and all have turned out to be lies.</p>
<p>I ask most politely to get help from a casino guru.</p>
<p>There have been several conversations and promises. (chat recordings/emails)</p>
<p>Appendix 1 rejection 23.2, 27.2, 7.3</p>
<p>Appendix 2 approved. Approved several times, and informed that my withdrawal is being processed and will be transferred soon.</p>
