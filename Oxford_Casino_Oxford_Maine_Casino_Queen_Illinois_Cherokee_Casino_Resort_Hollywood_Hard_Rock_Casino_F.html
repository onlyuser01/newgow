    <h1>Oxford Casino Oxford Maine Casino Queen Illinois Cherokee Casino Resort Hollywood Hard Rock Casino F</h1>

<p>In 2022, the Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin announced it joined forces with Hard Rock International for a new project that seeks to develop a new gaming and entertainment location in the city of Kenosha. The project has a price tag of $350 million and is expected to use some 60 acres of land located west of Interstate 94. The new gaming and entertainment resort is expected to boost tourism, local businesses and bring tax revenue for the state and the city. Additionally, the project, if approved, is expected to create new workplaces.</p>
<p>Last week, the Kenosha City Council voted in favor of giving the casino project final consideration for an agreement. An overwhelming majority of 12 members voted in favor of the final consideration while only three members voted against it, a report released by Kenosha News reveals. After this approval, the subject will be once again up for consideration at a meeting scheduled for November 20, 2023.</p>
<p>During the recent voting on Thursday, Hard Rock International’s regional president, Matt Schuffert, revealed that the project is expected to create 1,000 new full-time workplaces, offering an average hourly pay of $20. He predicted that the new casino and entertainment resort would generate annual revenues between $250 million and $295 million. Schuffert added: “The intergovernmental agreement calls for a total of about 5% of the net gaming revenue to go back to the city and the county,” explaining that annual revenue is expected to be in the ballpark of $12 million to $15 million.</p>
<p>Besides tax revenue, the new casino project is expected to bring benefits in the form of additional payments. Such payments are expected to provide vital funding for different state initiatives, helping public schools, museums and first responders.</p>
<p>Not Everyone Agrees with the Proposed Casino Project</p>
<p>At the recent meeting, Council members Kelly MacKay, Holly Kangas and David Mau voted against the proposed casino project. Citing witnessing the negative impact of gambling addiction, MacKay said he couldn’t cast a vote supporting the new casino and entertainment location planned to be developed on the west side of the city of Kenosha.</p>
<p>He was joined by more than two dozen people who also voiced their concerns during the recent public hearing. Many of the people who rejected the proposed casino project warned about crimes related to gambling. Notably, most of the people were concerned about the possible increase in addictions that can impact local communities.</p>
