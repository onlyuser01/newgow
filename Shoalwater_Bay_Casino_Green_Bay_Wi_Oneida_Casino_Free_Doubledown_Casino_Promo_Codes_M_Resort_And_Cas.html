    <h1>Shoalwater Bay Casino Green Bay Wi Oneida Casino Free Doubledown Casino Promo Codes M Resort And Cas</h1>

<p>Back in August this year, the government in Canada put forward Bill C-218. This enabled each of the country’s provinces to introduce and manage single-event sports betting. Ontario was the first province to start accepting applications. Now, Rivalry is looking to become a licensed operator in the province.</p>
<p>Rivalry Submits Application with AGCO</p>
<p>Rivalry, the sports betting and sports media company announced on Thursday this week that submitted an application with the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). With this move, the company plans to become a fully registered operator for sports betting and internet gaming in one of the most densely populated provinces in Canada.</p>
<p>In July this year, Ontario created iGaming Ontario, which is responsible for both managing and conducting internet gaming operations offered by private gaming companies. If Rivalry’s license is approved, registration will be issued by iGaming Ontario.</p>
<p>Once that happens, Rivalry will receive approval to offer sports and esports betting products. Moreover, the company will be able to roll out its one-of-a-kind casino dubbed Rushlane for Ontario customers. Although an official deadline is yet to be confirmed, Rivalry revealed that it expects to start esports, sports betting and iGaming operations in the province around the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>The iGaming Market in Ontario Holds Incredible Potential</p>
<p>Rivalry was founded in Toronto, Ontario in 2018 and it believes in hiring local talent to continue growing. By now, the company has a team of more than 80 employees. Thanks to a unique ethical approach to online gaming and esports, the company has achieved the highest monthly engagement out of any esports betting brand.</p>
<p>Currently, Rivalry holds a license for gaming in the Isle of Man. This is a key license as it gives the company access to more than 100 markets globally. Moreover, the company has a conditional license in Australia, where it expects to launch its services soon. Besides Canada, Rivalry plans to expand even further and enter new regulated markets around the world.</p>
<p>“We applaud the government of Ontario for its leadership in developing a robust licensing regime for iGaming.” Steven Salz, Co-Founder and CEO of Rivalry</p>
<p>Rivalry’s CEO and co-founder, Steven Salz, outlined that as a Toronto-based company, it is incredibly exciting that it will be able to offer its products and brand experiences. He acknowledged that the government of Ontario made a great decision by “developing a robust licensing regime for iGaming.” Salz added that the iGaming market in Ontario has a potential for significant growth. In conclusion, he revealed that the market will support responsible gambling practices while at the same time will create thousands of highly paid jobs in Ontario.</p>
