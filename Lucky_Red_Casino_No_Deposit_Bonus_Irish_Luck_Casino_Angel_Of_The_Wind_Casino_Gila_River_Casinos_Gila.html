<p>Leading global publisher Yggdrasil and independent gaming studio Bulletproof Games have combined their skills and released Meha Cash Stacks. The new slot game mixes eye-catching game mechanics and features that can generate huge wins. The game is packed with stacked symbols, offers free spins, and uses a Progressive Spins mechanic.</p>

<p>Mega Cash Stacks Symbols and Gameplay</p>
<p>The game is excellent for players who prefer conventional gameplay with one-of-a-kind features. The base game is still entertaining enough even when zero features are enabled. When the scatter symbols, wilds, and the rest of the special symbols come up on the grid, the action truly starts to pick up. The slot has the money theme at the center. Players win when landing a minimum of three identical symbols on a line.</p>
<p>All the symbols in the game are stacked on top of one another during the base game. The same happens when the bonus features are activated. This way, players get to boost their cash stacks.</p>
<p>The Progressive Spins mechanic is triggered when a player land at least three symbols on any location on the game reels. A player can win up to 15 free spins via the wheel of fortune mini-game. Each of the free spins pays out a cash prize that is greater than the previous free spin.</p>
<p>Players can also choose to gamble their winnings during the mini-game. Players must either choose the left-hand stack of coins for the opportunity to boost their cash winnings by one-third. They can also double or even triple their winnings. On the other hand, the right-hand cash stack of coins gives players the opportunity to win up to 15 extra progressive free spins.</p>
<p>Golden Bet – 50% Increase in Bet</p>
<p>Mega Cash Stacks lets players enable the bonus for 100x the stake or use a Golden Bet to increase their bet by 50%. This will double their chances of activating the Progressive Free Spins bonus.</p>
<p>The game is powered by Yggdrasil’s Game Adaptation Tools &amp; Interface (GATI) program which lets partners create games using advanced technology via toolkits that have been already configured and standardized. Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy spoke about the “great success” that the company has had “working alongside Bulletproof Games as part of the YG Masters program”. He also mentioned Bulletproof’s proven ability to create “truly wonderful games”, adding the new Mega Cash Stacks slot was no exception.</p>
<p>Bulletproof Games’ product director Michael Bullock also expressed the studio’s excitement regarding the launch of the game. He predicted the game will become “incredibly popular” among players thanks to the innovative Progressive Spins mechanic and stacked symbols. At the end of June, Yggdrasil partnered with Jelly to launch Buffalo Blox Gigablox. The previous month, the studio released Boilin’ Pots, another slot powered by GATI.</p>
