Additionally, BetRivers customers in Ontario and Michigan can tap into Greentube's classic titles such as Thunder Cash: Dolphin's Pearl, Lone Star Jackpots and Diamond Cash: Mighty Elephant, among other engaging and unique titles.</p>
<p>Richard Schwartz, RSI's Chief Executive Officer, shared his excitement about the extended deal with Greentube in a statement released on April 27, 2023. He explained: "BetRivers is known for delivering an industry-leading selection of casino games and experiences to players across all our markets."</p>
<p>Schwartz added that the company is delighted to extend its deal with Greentube. He acknowledged that the partnership builds on a strong foundation and predicted that it will deliver unique and engaging games for RSI's customers in Michigan, as well as Ontario.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Schwartz said: "Extending our partnership It's a natural step for us to extend the agreement to take in two new territories as we look forward to further collaborations in additional markets in the future."</p>
<p>Jorge Bartra Quispe, Greentube's Sales and Key Account Manager, was similarly excited about the extended collaboration with RSI. "Having seen how popular our games have been for RSIâ€™s players in New Jersey, it's fantastic to extend our reach across North America with launches in Ontario and Michigan," he said.</p>
<p>Finally, Quispe noted: "Our content is proven to resonate with players in the region and we look forward to rolling it out to a fresh wave of players in conjunction with our long-term partnership with RSI."</p>
