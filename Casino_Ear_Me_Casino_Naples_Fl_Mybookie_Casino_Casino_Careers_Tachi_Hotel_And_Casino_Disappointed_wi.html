    <h1>Casino Ear Me Casino Naples Fl Mybookie Casino Casino Careers Tachi Hotel And Casino Disappointed wi</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I signed up for Casino Guru because I really thought players would be taken care of and protected from SCAMs.</p>
<p>Since Wazamba Casino was/is rated very well here? I registered there. And I'm sorry but the reviews can't be right. And since Casino Guru receives a commission for every registration, its credibility is also very questionable.</p>
<p>At wazamba, the slots kept crashing, regardless of whether you were playing on your cell phone or laptop. No matter whether you delete cookies or try other browsers.</p>
<p>customer service LIE!!! It can not be said otherwise. In addition, they always send you to other service employees because it’s "shift change"…</p>
<p>then I wanted to pay out. After 5 days there is no verification and suddenly there is a withdrawal limit!!!</p>
<p>I wrote more emails and NEVER received a response.</p>
<p>I asked several times about a loyalty bonus and was always put off, even though every other casino had been a VIP with sales for a long time.</p>
<p>Then when I wanted to close the account, there was suddenly a bonus that was supposedly always there...</p>
<p>Account is there, money is gone and it wasn't fun either.</p>
<p>The fact that this casino is rated so well is a joke!!!</p>
<p>DON'T REPORT!!!</p>
<p>I don't think that's possible for DE anymore, but I've never been as ripped off as I was there and that was only because of Casino Guru, otherwise I would never have created an account there.</p>
<p>I'm curious whether the post will stay online here. As long as Wazamba is rated so well, you can't be taken seriously and are just fooling people.</p>
<p>I've been gaming for 10 years and I've never experienced anything like that, it was the epitome of cheating in a really disgusting way!!!</p>
<p>Well, that was 6 months ago or so and I actually wanted to write this post back then, but in the end it won't change anything anyway. However, I just received your email with "your opinion is unimportant"</p>
<p>There you have it!!! If you really care about the players, then launch a warning campaign against Wazamba, what's going on there is really bad. I hope that I can protect at least 1 player here.</p>
<p>Now it's over, bye</p>
