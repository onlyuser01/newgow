<p>As announced by FansUnite Entertainment Inc, BestOdds.com’s operator Stram Entertainment has signed a strategic deal to acquire BetPrep. The decision was made as a result of FansUnite’s strategy to optimize its operations, focus on profit, and accelerate its revenue growth.</p>
<p>The international entertainment and sports company that offers technology for regulated online gaming had previously expressed its plans to make its business more streamlined. Accordingly, FansUnite announced it would shift the focus on its Chameleon business-to-business technology platform as well as a number of additional business units that would generate higher revenue values and higher gross margins.</p>
<p>BestOdds to Pay 30% Revenue Share for Three Years</p>
<p>According to the terms of the new deal, BestOdds has agreed to pay FansUnite a revenue share of 30% over the course of the upcoming three years. The respective revenue share will be subject to a minimum monthly guarantee, once the previously agreed ramp-up period will come to an end on September 1, 2023.</p>
<p>BetPrep, the leading affiliate brand in the sports betting and iGaming industries with a focus on North America, enables bettors to try out various wagering strategies. This is done by comparing them to data and analysis pertaining to the most profitable betting conditions in history for all spots, player props, or sports leagues.</p>
<p>Unlocking Fresh Synergies</p>
<p>FansUnite believes the acquisition agreement will help it cut its operating costs without harming its planned growth while unlocking fresh synergies expected to generate revenue.</p>
<p>Speaking about the acquisition news, FansUnite’s chief executive officer Scott Burton said the new deal would allow them to keep benefitting from BetPrep’s revenue upside without having to tackle the operational costs. Burton also spoke about BestOdds’s good positioning on the market with a clear potential to turn BetPrep into a “successful product within their existing properties”.</p>
<p>Finally, he expressed their excitement regarding the new door that the partnership would open for FansUnite and BestOdds to keep working together.</p>
<p>BestOdd’s co-founder Will Armitage expressed similar feelings of excitement regarding the news of the acquisition. He added that the company was eager to collaborate with the FansUnite crew in the upcoming years while reaping their shared rewards.</p>
<p>In December 2022, FansUnite obtained a license to supply sports gaming services in Ohio. The license was issued by the Ohio Casino Control Commission and it was received right on time, ahead of the grand opening of the state’s sports gaming market on January 1, 2023.</p>
