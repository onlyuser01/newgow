<p>Court documents released by the US Attorney’s Office District of Connecticut reveal that Michael DiMassa was employed for 12 years at the City of West Haven. DiMassa allegedly defrauded the City of West Haven of more than $600,000 which resulted in charges against him of wire fraud. Part of that sum was allegedly used for buy-ins at Mohegan Sun Casino.</p>
<p>Police Arrests West Haven State Rep, Charges Him with Wire Fraud</p>
<p>DiMassa, 30, Democrat, was arrested by law enforcement officers on Wednesday this week. Charges against him allege that while he was a part of the City Council as Administrative Assistant, he fraudulently billed the City of West Haven and its COVID-19 Grant Fund. According to court documents, DiMassa allegedly defrauded the city from a total of $636,783.70.</p>
<p>DOJ documents outline that the elaborate scheme was completed with the help of a company called Compass Investment Group. Compass was in fact founded by DiMassa in January this year along with another individual and was allegedly used for the fraudulent billing.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors claim that between February and September this year, Compass Group Investment billed fraudulently for “consulting services purportedly provided to the West Haven Health Department that were not performed.” As a result, West Haven and its COVID fund were defrauded by more than $600,000.</p>
<p>Although DiMassa appeared before US District Judge Sarah A. L. Merriam, he was then released under a $250,000 bail. The wire fraud charges which the defendant is facing carry a maximum term of 20 years of imprisonment. The court has set the next date for December 10.</p>
<p>Affidavit Reveals That DiMassa Completed Multiple Cash-ins at Mohegan Sun</p>
<p>Charges against DiMassa claim that he made multiple large cash withdrawals from the Compass Investment Group Bank account. Some of those transactions were completed shortly before or after he allegedly made a large cash buy-in of gaming chips at the Mohegan Sun Casino.</p>
<p>An affidavit in support of the criminal complaint reveals that Mohegan Sun gaming records show that he made a cash buy-in of $4,000 on May 21, 2021. On May 23, he used $6,200 as buy-in and another $4,000 on May 28. Then, the affidavit reveals that on May 29, he purchased more chips for $10,400 at the casino.</p>
<p>“On May 21, 2021, Mohegan Sun Patron Gaming records reflect Michael DiMassa executed a cash buy-in of $4,000,” reads the affidavit</p>
<p>The wire fraud charges are the result of an investigation by the FBI in collaboration with the US Department of Housing and Urban Development – Office of Inspector General for Investigations. Currently, Assistant US Attorney Ray Miller is prosecuting the case.</p>
<p>Leonard C. Boyle, Acting US Attorney stressed that the “criminal complaint is not evidence of guilt.” Charges are only allegations and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
