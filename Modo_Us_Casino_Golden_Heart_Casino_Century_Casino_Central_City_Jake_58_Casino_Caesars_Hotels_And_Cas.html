<p>Wind Creek has signed an official partnership with the Chicago Bulls, a prominent NBA franchise, and will now help the teams’ fans have an elevated experience at the company’s new casino in Chicago. This is a multi-year deal that will see the two companies collaborate on a range of fan experiences designed to elevate the hospitality experience of the property and bring fans interested in placing a wager closer to the action once the East Hazel Crest &amp; Homewood property opens its doors.</p>
<p>Wind Creek Welcomes Bulls Fans in Multi-Year Partnership</p>
<p>Wind Creek Hospitality COO Brent Pinkston welcomed this opportunity and said that he was happy to bring fans closer to the action at the new Chicago property. He added:</p>
<p>As a new brand coming to the Chicagoland market, we believed it was important to establish a name for ourselves and a level of credibility with the local market as quickly as possible. Wind Creek Hospitality COO Brent Pinkston</p>
<p>Pinkston himself a native of the “Chicagoland” was happy with the partnership and added that this opportunity with the Bulls was definitely something very natural for Wind Creek Hospitality. Chicago Bulls VP of business development Mark Levitt was similarly pleased with the chance and said that the team was stoked to be joining this link-up with Wind Creek. Levitt added:</p>
<p>This new partnership will support our ongoing efforts to further elevate the gameday experience for Bulls fans at the United Centre and across our social platforms. Chicago Bulls VP of business development Mark Levitt</p>
<p>Partnerships between casinos and sports teams have been very popular as they empower properties that offer sportsbooks a better opportunity to engage with the fans of those franchises. Overall, the United States has expanded its sports betting landscape and interest in sports through clever partnerships between online suppliers, sports teams, and land-based properties such as the ones owned by Wind Creek Hospitality.</p>
