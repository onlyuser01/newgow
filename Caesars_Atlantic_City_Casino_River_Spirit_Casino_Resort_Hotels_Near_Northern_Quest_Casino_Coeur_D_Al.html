    <h1>Caesars Atlantic City Casino River Spirit Casino Resort Hotels Near Northern Quest Casino Coeur D Al</h1>

<p>I am sorry I could not be of more help on this occasion.</p>
<p>For these reasons, and as your deposits have been returned to you, there is nothing more we can achieve in this case and the complaint will now be closed.</p>
<p>Most casinos check for multiple accounts during the verification process at the point of withdrawal. While this is not ideal, it is currently the industry standard and explains how you have been able to deposit and play in your second account without being previously detected, especially as your first account was not verified.</p>
<p>It is clear, however, that you have opened a second account, and used details different than those used for your first account to be able to do so (e-mail instead of a phone number). In doing so, you have directly circumvented the terms and conditions of the casino.</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear why you have closed your first account. You have sent the request for closure to the e-mail address listed in the responsible gambling section of the website specifically for requesting an indefinite self-exclusion, but have not stated any reason when doing so.</p>
<p>We have carefully reviewed all of the information pertaining to this case, but I'm afraid there is not much that we can do to help you.</p>
