<p>John Shallerhorn’s anti-mask tirade on the casino floor at Harrah’s was captured by body cameras of New Orleans police officers as they escorted the 35-year-old from the premises. The video was published Thursday by Nola.com.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed Mask Issue</p>
<p>After leaving the casino, Shallerhorn attempted to enter the basketball game at George Carver High School, according to police reports. But he was advised by a school employee to abide by “game-entry protocol.” The phrase is widely interpreted in media reports as being asked to mask-up.</p>
<p>Deputy Constable Matinus Mitchum intervened after Shallerhorn punched the employee in the face. The police officer was shot in the chest and killed as he escorted Shallerhorn outside. He had not been wearing a bulletproof vest at the time.</p>
<p>Shallerhorn then dropped his weapon, put his hands up, and waited for the police to arrive. He has been charged with first-degree murder of a police officer. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>At a press conference Monday, New Orleans Police Superintendent Shaun Ferguson refused to be drawn on whether the shooting was about mask mandates.</p>
<p>“I know everyone is trying to make this a mask issue,” he said. “We cannot confirm this is a mask issue whatsoever.”</p>
<p>Shallerhorn’s Casino Rant</p>
<p>Earlier, police were called to Harrah’s after Shallerhorn threw a mask given to him by casino staff on the floor and had refused to leave the premises.</p>
<p>When confronted by officers, Shallerhorn agreed to leave the casino after he learned he would be arrested. The officers handcuffed Shallerhorn and escorted him to the back of a police cruiser.</p>
<p>I go to Walmart, and I don’t wear a mask,” Shallerhorn said. “I went to Home Depot — don’t wear a mask. And I come here — that’s discrimination.”</p>
<p>A police officer then told Shallerhorn that Harrah’s is a private business and can therefore set its own safety rules. Shallerhorn then said, “There’s no such thing as private ownership when it comes down to a free land. This is a free land. Society is all screwed up. Technology is all screwed up. Perception is all screwed up. The world is all ran wrong.”</p>
<p>In a statement Thursday, Shallerhorn’s attorney, public defender Mariah Holder, described Mitchum’s death as a tragedy. She added her client was “known as a lovely man when he is doing well, but has a history of serious mental health crisis and hospitalization.”</p>
