<p>White Hat Gaming, a state-of-the-art iGaming platform provider, has expanded its reach in the United States by launching its player account management (PAM) solution in Maryland. This is notably the fourteenth state where the company’s products are available.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming Entered Maryland</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming will now be able to join Maryland sports betting and supply companies in the state with its critically-acclaimed player account management solution. This will make White Hat one of the first players in the Free State’s fresh sports betting market.</p>
<p>White Hat, which is famed for powering sports betting brands such as PENN Entertainment’s Barstool Sports sportsbook, will help wagering companies by providing them with its “fully-managed and battle-tested” PAM product.</p>
<p>The company’s end-to-end solution is considered best-in-class thanks to its various functionalities. For example, the award-winning Travelling Wallet tool allows players to move between states within the US without having to transfer their funds. In addition, Travelling Wallet includes a built-in cashier that provides gambling companies with a high degree of customization and control.</p>
<p>CEO Gelvan Praised the Launch</p>
<p>Online sports betting in Maryland goes live today, which means that White Hat Gaming’s PAM solution will hit the new market on day 1. The solution will launch alongside digital sports wagering in the state, which attests to its ability to quickly adapt to and expand into new regulated jurisdictions across the world.</p>
<p>Phil Gelvan, the chief executive officer of White Hat Gaming, spoke about the new launch. He applauded his team’s hard work that made this launch possible. He is happy that the company has taken its PAM solution into yet another regulated US jurisdiction. Gelvan noted that the company’s reach attests to White Hat’s engineering capabilities and agility.</p>
<p>Gelvan concluded that White Hat Gaming feels proud to enter Maryland and continue to support its trusted partner PENN Entertainment and its sports betting brand.</p>
<p>We are proud to have entered Maryland alongside our long-term operator partner PENN Entertainment and its Barstool Sports brand. It’s an exciting period for White Hat Gaming as we continue to enjoy considerable growth and believe Maryland will prove to be another key market of traction for the company. Phil Gelvan, CEO, White Hat Gaming</p>
<p>In other news, White Hat Gaming continues to expand its reach in other jurisdictions as well. A week ago, the iGaming specialist deployed its PAM solution in Puerto Rico thanks to its agreement with the ApuestaPR brand, a sports betting subsidiary of LMG Gaming.</p>
