<p>Pragmatic Play has added another market to its growth list in 2020 with an end-of-year deal in Croatia and Novomatic’s Admiral Casino.</p>
<p>Novomatic’s Admiral Casino Gets a Pragmatic Play Boost</p>
<p>With mere days left on the calendar year, Pragmatic Play is still pressing on with its end-of-2020 business plans, breaking ground in new territories through a new tie-up with Novomatic’s Admiral Casino in Croatia.</p>
<p>This is a first for Pragmatic Play which has expanded its footprint all over Europe. The latest deal consolidates the brand’s presence in the continent. As part of the deal, Pragmatic Play will extend its entire portfolio of award-winning slots to Novomatic’s brand.</p>
<p>Admiral Casino will run popular products such as Wolf Gold and Sweet Bonanza and offer local players a touch of Pragmatic Play’s original content. As an added benefit, Admiral Casino players will be able to benefit from Enhance, Pragmatic’s advanced gamification toolkit.</p>
<p>Adding Enhance will lead to better engagement and retention, boosting player retention, executives predict. Commenting on the partnership, Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely was excited to roll out Pragmatic’s products at Novomatic’s Admiral Casino.</p>
<p>“It marks an important step,” said Barzely noted, and added that Pragmatic is making conscious efforts to expand its presence in the regulated Croatian market. Choosing Admiral as the first brand to partner up could not have gone better, he concluded.</p>
<p>Zarko Zuvela, head of the online gaming department at Admiral Croatia, which is part of Novomatic Group, further added that Pragmatic Play has one of the broadest slot offerings in the industry, making for a perfect partner to boost commercial reach.</p>
<p>Thanks to this addition, Admiral Casino can ensure that there is a sufficiently diverse offering to satisfy the slot needs of all players, Zuvela said. Pragmatic Play has had a busy final push this year.</p>
<p>The company released a continuation of its popular John Hunter slot franchise, with the Mayan Gods installment arriving earlier in December. Still in December, Casumo, another leading iGaming brand, added Pragmatic Play’s portfolio through direct integration.</p>
<p>The company also signed a live content partnership with Kindred and in October, Pragmatic Play strengthened its Latin American push with a new tie-up in Colombia.</p>
