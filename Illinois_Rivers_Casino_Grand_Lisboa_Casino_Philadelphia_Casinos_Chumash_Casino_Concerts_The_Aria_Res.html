<p>New York, Texas and New Jersey have all been important parts of Jackpocket’s strategy and long-term growth pursuit.

<p>He is correct in his surmise as mobile and digital have been key drivers of engagement with lotteries, forcing companies to quickly adapt to these new market realities. Jackpocket tied its quarterly reporting to some interesting factoids about the numbers that people picked, and the numbers that ended up on the draws. Across the United States, 7, 11 and 3 remained the favorite numbers, second only to 9.</p>
<p>The Mega Ball and Powerball numbers saw 13, 7 and 8 as the most frequent ones. The number of women playing the lottery in the second quarter of 2022 fell a bit to 41.3% of the total compared to 42.5% during the first quarter of the year.</p>
<p>Men playing the lottery inched up, understandably, to 58.7% of the total. Jackpocket has made consistent efforts to establish its footprint. The company teamed up with ESPN in New York and also sought closer partnership with MLB’s New York Mets. The company successfully launched in Montana in early July, adding more milestones underway during the third quarter.</p>
<p>The report revealed other interesting numbers for the second quarter. For example, 42% of players used the Quick Pick option to select their numbers automatically. The remainder 58% preferred to manually select their own numbers.</p>
