<p>On Saturday and Sunday, the Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Rams, New England Patriots, and New Orleans Saints all took care of business at home. The Philadelphia Eagles were the only losing team to cover the spread, which was a touchdown at most sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The Chiefs won by 18 to easily cover the 4.5 points they were allocating the Indianapolis Colts. The Rams won by eight to narrowly cover their seven-point spread, and the Patriots won easily over the Los Angeles Chargers.</p>
<p>Late money on the Saints that ballooned the spread to 8.5 points allowed the underdog Eagles to cover in their six-point defeat.</p>
<p>Saints Remain Blessed</p>
<p>Heading into the NFL conference championships, Drew Brees and the Saints are the odds-on team to beat. They’ve been the favorites for many weeks.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas has New Orleans at 7/4 to win Super Bowl 53. That’s implied odds of 36.36 percent, with a $100 bet netting $175 should Brees win his second Vince Lombardi trophy.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are next at 11/4 (26.67 percent odds, $100 returning $275). The Patriots and Rams are both at 7/2 (22.22 percent, $100 returning $350).</p>
<p>After the Eagles jumped off to a 14-0 lead, the Saints played catchup in the second to get the score to 14-10 at the half. Philadelphia went scoreless in the second, as New Orleans scored another 10.</p>
<p>Listen, they got off to a fast start, they’re a great team,” Brees said. “Nick Foles has done a phenomenal job for them. We knew it was going to be different than last time.”</p>
<p>Last time came in November when the Saints handed Philly a crushing 48-7 defeat. The defending champion Eagles stood at 4-6, and seemed poised to miss the playoffs.</p>
<p>Next Weekend</p>
<p>On Sunday, both the NFC and AFC championships will determine which two teams head to Super Bowl LIII.</p>
<p>The Rams will play in New Orleans at 3:05 pm ET, and the home team is a 3.5-point favorite. As for the moneyline, the Rams are at +155, and the Saints -175.</p>
<p>The nightcap is the Patriots playing at the Chiefs where the home team is currently favored by a field goal. The moneyline has New England at +135, and Kansas City at -155.</p>
<p>The Patriots are making their eighth straight appearance in the AFC Championship. But playing the underdog role is nearly uncharted territory. Sunday’s matchup against the Chiefs will put superstar quarterback and future Canton inductee Tom Brady as a dog for the first time in 68 starts.</p>
<p>The last time came in September of 2015 when New England hosted the Buffalo Bills. The Patriots easily covered their two-point underdog spread by winning 40-32.</p>
<p>The last time New England was an underdog in a playoff game was in 2007. They lost to Peyton Manning’s Denver Broncos 26-16, and failed to cover the five-point spread.</p>
