<p>Playson has signed a content partnership with Sportingtech’s Pulse Gaming Platform to reach new audiences in Europe, Latin America and Africa.</p>
<p>Sportingtech Adds Playson’s Game Portfolio to Pulse Gaming</p>
<p>A developer of casino software and games, Playson has forged a fresh partnership content deal with Sportingtech, an iGaming platform supplier and the developer of the Pulse Gaming Platform solution.</p>
<p>Thanks to the tie-up, Playson will debut its premium portfolio of award-winning and industry-defining games, adding popular picks such as Buffalo Power: Hold and Win and Solar King to the titles available to Sportingtech B2B partners and their customers.</p>
<p>The partnership will also see the time-traveling classic Legend of Cleopatra: Megaways morph itself throughout Sportingtech’s network.</p>
<p>Sportingtech’s Pulse Gaming Platform is an advanced aggregator tool that allows easy access to casino games by multiple award-winning studios, a selection that has now been further strengthened with the addition of Playson’s own unique gamma of products.</p>
<p>The studio’s bespoke games focus on predominantly Asian and Egyptian-themed, 10-to-20-payline games loaded with features such as jackpots, free spins, feature trigger, and an omni-channel experience.</p>
<p>The arrival of the revamped Legend of Cleopatra in collaboration with Big Time Gaming’s proprietor Megaways feature is an opportunity to move away from a more conservative approach towards paylines and introduce this ambitious product to new audiences thanks to Sportingtech.</p>
<p>Strong Year of Growth for Playson</p>
<p>Playson’s latest agreement with Sportingtech marks a busy period of successful ties-up for the company. The company started December on a strong foot, entering the Italian market through a partnership with Blox.</p>
<p>Earlier in October, Playson bolstered its presence in the European market through a Novibet deal, and in September struck three independent partnerships with Princess Casino, Boss Gaming, Alea and their associated brands.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Playson Sales Director Blanka Homor said that the company was happy to team up with Sportingtech, expressing confidence that the Playson’s portfolio will perform well across the network of brands associated.</p>
<p>Pulse Gaming Platform gaming covers markets in Europe, Latin America and Africa, giving Playson an opportunity to reach new customers.</p>
<p>Sharing Playson’s positivity, Sportingtech Operations Manager Duarte Henriques said that “Playson continued to strengthen its reputation as a world class supplier of iGaming content throughout 2020, so it’s brilliant to have the developer on board.”</p>
<p>Henriques acknowledged the recent string of successful releases by Playson and argued that the company’s content should make for a nice addition to the existing content available on Pulse Gaming.</p>
