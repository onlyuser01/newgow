    <h1>Tropicana Online Casino Pa Lincoln Ri Casino Rivers Casino Portsmouth Photos Monte Carlo Casino Mona</h1>

<p>Before registering in any casino, I carefully read the ratings on your site. After reading about Lady Hammer casino, I trusted a good assessment and registered using your link. They constantly sent their bonus offers to the mail. For all the time I have replenished my account at this casino 8 times. For the eighth time, I was finally able to win at this casino. I replenished my eighth deposit with 200 euros, having received a 50% bonus and from 300 euros I went to 1965 euros, having fulfilled all the bonus conditions. I ordered a withdrawal, but the payment was declined. After a while, the following answer came: Dear Friend,</p>
<p>We found out that you have exceeded the maximum bet while playing with the bonus.</p>
<p>Sorry, but due to that we had to correct your balance to the deposit amount. We kindly ask you to observe our Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions and be more attentive next time.</p>
<p>Sorry for any inconvenience caused and hope for understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Ladyhammer Casino Support Team</p>
<p>Having contacted the chat, I was informed that yesterday there were several bets with an excess on Immersive Roulette, from 5 EUR to 47 EUR. As a result, the finance department checked these bets and confiscated my winnings.</p>
<p>Just think: due to multiple bets over 5 euros when playing with a bonus, lady Hammer casinos confiscate winnings. Moreover, they add that the player must limit himself and in no case put more than 5 euros on the bonus money, otherwise it will be an abuse of the bonus.</p>
<p>They also refused to return past deposits, writing that the casino does not return lost deposits, and my balance, according to them, was adjusted to the amount of the last deposit.</p>
<p>I have never had such problems with any casino. If I exceeded the maximum bet, then the maximum did not count towards the bonus wagering. I think this is just theft. 1765 euros were stolen by this casino. I beg you to help me with this problem. The chat correspondence is completely saved, and if necessary, I can forward it to you.</p>
