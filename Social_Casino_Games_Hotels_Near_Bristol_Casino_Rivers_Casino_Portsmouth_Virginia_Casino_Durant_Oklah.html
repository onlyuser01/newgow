    <h1>Social Casino Games Hotels Near Bristol Casino Rivers Casino Portsmouth Virginia Casino Durant Oklah</h1>

<p>I had already had problems with this casino and I even tried to exclude myself on April 27 and I never received an answer, obviously because I have problems for betting I kept playing, I managed to withdraw 3 times with a lot of work since they told me that I was not verified when I never did. They said even though I had already uploaded my documents.</p>
<p>I kept playing and a few days ago I deposited 200 pesos, I went down but I managed to get up to 300 pesos and I preferred to withdraw, I was waiting a few days until I received a notification that they canceled the withdrawal because I had not met the wagering requirements but I did not have any bonus, it It makes me illogical that they ask you to spend more than what you deposit when you don't ask for a bonus.</p>
<p>I contacted by chat to ask for my exclusion and they told me that for that I first have to be verified, which I already am, otherwise I would not have asked to withdraw previously, they gave me the email again where I have to write but I have not done it, like I said they have not answered the previous one, I stayed online waiting for an answer but they closed my session, today I went back in and I am still not excluded.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, chats cannot be saved, so I don't have proof of the chat, but I do have screenshots of the email sent in April and the one received, canceling my withdrawal.</p>
<p>Since I asked for my exclusion I have lost more than I have won and I know that if they do not close my account I will continue betting so I need help.</p>
<p>I attach screenshots of the mentioned emails.</p>
