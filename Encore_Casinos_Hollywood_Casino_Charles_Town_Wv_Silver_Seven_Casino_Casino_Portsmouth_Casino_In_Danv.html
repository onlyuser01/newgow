<p>Tower Quest review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>At first glance, Tower Quest looks to be a straightforward high-fantasy themed slot. It has armoured elves, vicious-looking orcs, dragons, wizards, and potions galore.</p>
<p>Beneath all of this are hints of Magic: The Gathering, These hints blossom to fullness in one of the bonus games, which sports card and dice-based gameplay.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to storm the dark tower and defeat the evil wizard now you can do that in slot form.</p>
<p>Pick your fighter for a card battle against the wizard</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are one of Tower Quest’s big selling points, with a strong collection of characters as symbols on the reels and interesting world-building featured in the artwork and backgrounds.</p>
<p>There are plenty of animations, with every win and spin coming with unique animations for each symbol. Little wisps of magic float from the reels to the counters when the Potion symbols land (more on that later).</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a sparkling mix of cinematic digital orchestras with some metal riffs underneath for the moments when things kick into high gear, like during the bonus rounds.</p>
<p>Big win from the blue scatter symbol bonus game</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Tower Quest is a five reel slot with three reels and twenty fixed win lines.</p>
<p>The main appeal of the game is in the various bonus features which use unique mechanics and give the player a great deal of choice in how and when they are triggered (fuller details below).</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Blue Scatter, Red Scatter and Bonus symbols. The Wilds are three symbols high and so there is a chance of landing multiple Wilds when the player does hit one.</p>
<p>There are three Bonuses. One which is triggered by hitting three Bonus symbols and two which depend on the Scatter and are triggered by the player themselves.</p>
<p>The Scatter based bonuses use the counters either side of the reels. Each Red or Blue Scatter that falls is added to the counter. The player can trigger the bonus after certain thresholds. The later the threshold (and therefore more symbols they have accrued), the better the bonus.</p>
<p>Top tier bonus game from 15 blue scatter symbols</p>
<p>This allows the player to take frequent small bonuses or wait longer between bonuses but get bigger ones.</p>
<p>For example, the player can trigger the Blue Scatter bonus after five symbols have accrued on the counter. In this case they receive one free spin with a middle reel locked in as all Wild. If the player waited until they had ten or fifteen symbols accrued they would still receive one spin, but for ten symbols the spin would have five of the regular symbols counting as Wilds, and for fifteen reels one, three and five are all Wild.</p>
<p>The Red Scatters have five spins with a times three multiplier for ten accrued symbols, and additional Wilds added for twenty and thirty accrued symbols.</p>
<p>Win from the red scatter bonus game</p>
<p>The other bonus is triggered by hitting three Bonus symbols and results in a Magic the Gathering style combat game against the wizard with your winnings based on how well you do against the wizard’s deck.</p>
<p>As bonuses go these are some of the most interesting and surprising out there and really make this game stand out from the pack.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.00% which is more or less exactly our yardstick for average.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin. That should keep most questers happy, from the lowest squire to the fanciest of knights.</p>
<p>Paytable for Tower Quest slot machine</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, meaning wins are moderately frequent, and aren’t likely to be especially large when they do come in. As a result, this slot is a weak match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>The many other strengths of this slot may beat out strategic considerations though.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With clever gameplay and beautiful visual design, Tower Quest is a delight to play.</p>
<p>The RTP is 96%, which is pretty middle of the road and doesn’t do much to mitigate the medium volatility. This does mean that those who follow our preferred strategies might wish to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>For anyone else though, this is an excellent fantasy-themed slot.</p>
