    <h1>Prairie Band Casino And Resort Rainbow Club Casino Aquarius Casino Resort Laughlin Nevada Hilton Cas</h1>

<p>My problem is I canâ€™t get the application for withdrawal processed. This must be done before I can request to withdrawal my moneyâ€¦ That is what was supposed to be done in 4 business days, it has now been 8. I read all the information I could on withdrawing my money and Iâ€™ve done everything right on my end, why canâ€™t they follow their own rules and do their part? Iâ€™ve received and answered the same email all last week which asked which crypto wallet I used. The email said,</p>
<p>"Thank you for your email.</p>
<p>We would also kindly ask you to confirm your Bitcoin wallet through email to ensure 100% accuracy of the payments.</p>
<p>Please note that we are temporarily unable to process withdrawals to CashApp BTC wallets due to technical difficulties. To eliminate the possibility of any errors, we would kindly ask you to clarify which exchange service you are using.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing back from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>With that question I responded multiple times with the name of my crypto walletâ€¦When I called Sunday they said they needed my bitcoin address. Thatâ€™s not stated in their previous emails to me but ok so I sent that numerous times.</p>
<p>their response was:</p>
<p>" Thank you for your request. Can you please provide us with a Bitcoin address typed in as the subject of the email?</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please message us anytime. We're here 24/7. Have a good one ðŸ’™</p>

<p>Therefore I sent the bitcoin address on the subject line of the responding email. Now itâ€™s been crickets, and Iâ€™m frustrated wondering what excuse this casino is going to come up with next. Although Iâ€™m following all directions to get "processed" for withdrawal, it seems as if the casino is trying multiple tactics to not provide me with my winnings. This is the first step before even requesting a withdrawal. Contact with lucky tiger casino is horrible as their customer service agents who answer phone/chat can provide absolutely no personal financial information. Constantly Iâ€™ve been told to "email" customer service or the finance department. As email is the only source of communication concerning my account. This is ridiculous!</p>
