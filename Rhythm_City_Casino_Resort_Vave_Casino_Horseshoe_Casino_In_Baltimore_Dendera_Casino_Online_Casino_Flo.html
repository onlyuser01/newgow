    <h1>Rhythm City Casino Resort Vave Casino Horseshoe Casino In Baltimore Dendera Casino Online Casino Flo</h1>

<p>I engaged with Ruby Slots Casino under their no deposit bonus, which mandated a 40x playthrough and a $100 Max Cashout. After successfully meeting these requirements and accumulating winnings totaling $180.18, I proceeded to initiate my first withdrawal on 11/26/2023. Unfortunately, it was cancelled without notification, and only on 11/29/2023, did I become aware of this issue.</p>
<p>Subsequently, I made another withdrawal attempt via Bitcoin on the same day, complying with the 7 business days approval period. On 12/09/2023, faced with continued delays, I decided to escalate my case. On 12/11/2023, my withdrawal was denied, and after inquiring with casino support, I was informed of additional playthrough requirements of $186, which were not visible on the frontend but indicated on the backend.</p>
<p>Despite successfully completing the mysterious playthrough and concluding that session with a withdrawable amount of $210, my second withdrawal attempt on the same day (12/11/2023) was also denied. This time, I encountered conflicting playthrough claims from two different Casino Support Representatives. On 12/20/2023, Support Sharon asserted that I had only played $204 out of $240 and still needed to play an additional $37. Conversely, on 12/25/2023, Support Ernest claimed I had only completed $257 of $1,200 in playthrough, a statement inconsistent with the information provided throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency and shifting conditions for withdrawal have left me deeply frustrated. I have diligently followed the casino's procedures, completed the stipulated playthrough requirements, and adhered to all instructions provided by the support team. The constant denial of withdrawals, each time citing different playthrough amounts, raises serious concerns about the fairness and transparency of Ruby Slots Casino's operations.</p>
