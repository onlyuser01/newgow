<p>Hi Casino Guru,</p>
<p>I received an email with an offer of 500% bonus.</p>
<p>Asking their livechat how long the bonus will be available, I received false information and by the time I made the deposit, the offer was already gone.</p>
<p>The new supporter in livechat read the former conversation and admited that I received false information but I was told the offer is no longer valid and I can't have it.</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>I made my deposit via Neosurf which is also offered as withdrawal method with a min. withdrawal of 20€.</p>
<p>I did the KYC and requested a withdrawal of my 30€ which has pending status.</p>
<p>The supporter in livechat all of a sudden tells me that neosurf withdrawals don't work and will be rejected. Alternatively, bitcoin (min. 20€) withdrawals can't be processed because the deposit was made in fiat currency.</p>
<p>Now the only way for me to get my deposit back is to make a bank transfer deposit which has a minimum of 200€.</p>
<p>Which means that if you are tricked into making a deposit via Neosurf, you will not be able to make any withdrawal if you are not willing to make another bank transfer with a minimum of 200€. And if you do so, you wont be able to make the withdrawal if you have not wagered your deposit at least 3 times.</p>
<p>This is a complete scam don't you agree?</p>
<p>I don't know what to do now. Can you please help me?</p>
