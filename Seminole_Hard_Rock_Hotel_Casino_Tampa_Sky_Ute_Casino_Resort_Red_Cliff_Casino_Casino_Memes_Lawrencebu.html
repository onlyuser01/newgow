    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Tampa Sky Ute Casino Resort Red Cliff Casino Casino Memes Lawrencebu</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am grateful for any assistance you can provide to help resolve a long standing, ongoing issue I am having with this dishonest, dodgy, sham of a casino. They seriously need to be shut down. Wild Pharao casino is a SCAM.</p>
<p>Firstly, I am from Australia, which is a country restricted from joining and playing at Wild Pharao. Something, I did not discover until well after I had signed up and successfully processed a 5 Euro deposit. I encountered no issues at any time, until I attempted to play any of the slots games. It wasn't until I contacted their live support that I was advised of Australia being restricted. After a quick look at my bank account, I discovered that Wild Pharao had not only allowed and accepted the 5 euro deposit I had made despite being from a restricted country. They had also (somehow) withdrawn a total of 7 separate transactions from my bank account. All 7 transactions appear as WBN<em>fr</em>INFOGATE NIG Lagos NG and are for amounts between AUD$13.85 and AUD$13.88 and add up to a total amount of AUD$97.05 which they have STOLEN from my account. I do not know how they managed to do this especially from a player in a restricted country!</p>
<p>Obviously, I addressed this issue with them immediately and requested a full refund of AUD$97.05. This all transpired on 31st December, 2021.</p>
<p>On 2nd January, 2022, I received a emailed reply from these thieves that simply said; 'Hi, will be processing' and nothing else, no sender name or any actual information.</p>
<p>On 4th January, 2022 I replied requested further information, such as when the refund will be processed and how long it should take for the refunded money to appear in my bank account.</p>
<p>I have not heard another thing from this bunch of thieving scammers. I have lost count of the number of emails I have sent them following up on this, but it was well over 50 and, admittedly, were less polite each time. Since their email on the 2nd January, I have received absolutely no correspondence or refund from these clowns. AUD$97.05 is a lot of money to me at the moment and I can't afford to lose it, especially when I never intended to make such a large deposit in the first place. Its a big difference to the 5 euro deposit I did make. Ultimately, they should have restricted my ability to sign up in the first place, let alone allowed me to make a deposit and they absolutely should not have been able to process a further 6 deposit transactions from my bank account. They should be shut down or at least completely blacklisted.</p>
<p>Are you able to help recover my STOLEN money from these thieves please? I get absolutely no response from them and I do not know what else I can do.</p>
<p>Thanking you</p>
<p>Suzanne</p>
