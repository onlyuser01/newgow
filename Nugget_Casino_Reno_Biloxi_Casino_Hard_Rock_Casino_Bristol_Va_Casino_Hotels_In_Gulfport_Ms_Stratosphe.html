<p>Ruby Seven Studios, a top-ranking social casino gaming company, has penned a deal with the US-based proven hit-game content provider ODDSworks. Thanks to the agreement, the former company will expand its offerings with new premium games.</p>
<p>ODDSworks to Provide Ruby Seven with Games</p>
<p>As per the agreement, ODDSworks will power Ruby Seven Studios with some of its best titles. OODSworks will deliver them through BetGuard, its proprietary remote game server. The deal will diversify Ruby Seven’s offerings and help the company engage more of its customers with exciting and atmospheric games.</p>
<p>The ODDSworks games will join Ruby Seven’s list of gaming titles. The latter also includes more than 20 in-house games, developed by Ruby Seven. The company seeks to provide its fans with diverse titles and hopes to appeal to a wide range of players. To that end, it has developed games supported on various web platforms, as well as Apple, Facebook, Amazon Kindle and GooglePlay.</p>
<p>One of Ruby Seven’s most recent games is a slots title that was launched in March as a collaboration with Choctaw Casinos &amp; Resorts.</p>
<p>Ruby Seven Wants to Engage the Audiences</p>
<p>Steven DeMar, the executive vice president of ODDSworks, spoke about the new partnership. He said that social gaming revenue and exposure add additional value to its game development suppliers. DeMar attributed ODDSworks’ success to its ambitious distribution plan, saying that this is precisely what sends game developers from all over the world “flocking to ODDSworks.”</p>
<p>Michael Carpenter, the president of Ruby Seven Studios, also commented the deal. He emphasized that his company will seek to maintain its leadership position in the online casino space. Because of this, adding great casino content is crucial. Carpenter believes that ODDSworks’ games will be a great addition to his company’s already strong roster of iGaming titles.</p>
<p>With this new partnership, we are going to add successful, online real money titles from OddsWorks’ unique library to our suite of social casino apps. Michael Carpenter, president of Ruby Seven Studios</p>
