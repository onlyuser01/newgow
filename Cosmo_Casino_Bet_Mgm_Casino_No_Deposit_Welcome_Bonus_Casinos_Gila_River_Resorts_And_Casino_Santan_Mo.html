<p>Strip Club in Vegas Offers $1M Couples Package to Taylor &amp; Travis</p>

<p>Wherever Taylor Swift plans to celebrate a Super Bowl victory by the Kansas Chiefs with her beau, tight end Travis Kelce, in known to only them and their handlers right now.</p>
<p>Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club has offered Swelce a comped couples package, including unlimited access to its $10K-an-hour Mohney Suite, a lifetime of free lap dances, a champagne bottle parade, and $50K cash to make it rain — that it claims is worth $1M. (Image: Associated Press)</p>
<p>One place you can lay good money on not finding them is Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club. That’s because the Las Vegas strip club, located half a mile from Allegiant Stadium, has used the celebrity romance currently warming America’s heart to launch a self-serving campaign promoting services designed to warm other bodily areas.</p>
<p>The club has offered America’s favorite celebrity couple since Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley — hell, probably since Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio — a comped couples package that it claims is worth $1M.</p>
<p>After the Chiefs/Raiders game on November 26, Travis Kelce wears a T-shirt advertising Crazy Horse 3, a Las Vegas Strip club located even closer to Allegiant Stadium than the Hustler Club. (Image: Instagram/toriiiiibrook_)</p>
<p>“We are used to catering to A-list celebrities and athletes alike, so we can ensure their discretion will be met while partying inside our venue,” the club’s general manager, Brittany Rose, told TMZ.</p>
<p>Not in 1M Years</p>
<p>Even assuming a Chiefs win on February 11, which is still a big assumption even though they won it last year and in 2020 — $1M is a dozen times less than Swift earns per concert, according to Forbes, and only $300K more than Kelce earns per NFL game.</p>
<p>Both 34-year-old icons earn that in real money, too, not in strip-club services valuated by the strip club itself.</p>
<p>Swift, whom Kelce’s older brother, Jason, recently called an “unbelievable role model for young women,” has never once been photographed entering or exiting a strip club. And, though Kelce did wear a T-shirt advertising another Las Vegas strip club on November 26 at Allegiant Stadium, Swift isn’t likely to break her streak on the one night when more of the world’s eyes will be watching her every move than ever before.</p>
<p>While advertising comps to tourists inconvenienced by the MGM Resorts cyberattack may get a taker or two, this was an offer guaranteed to generate publicity while costing Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club nothing.</p>
<p>And this assessment didn’t even take into account how offensive the pair would likely find another advertisement from Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club, one currently running on its billboard: “NOW AUDITIONING SWIFTIES FOR THE BIG GAME 2024.”</p>
