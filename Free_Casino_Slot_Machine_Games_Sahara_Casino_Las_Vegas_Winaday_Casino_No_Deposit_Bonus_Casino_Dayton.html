<p>Stats Perform will distribute data for the leagues through the 2024/25 season</p>
<p>Sports data juggernaut Stats Perform will continue to serve as the official statistics partner of the EPL, EFL and SPFL. As a result, the company will continue to distribute data for thousands of English and Scottish soccer games.</p>
<p>The development comes as a result of the extension of Stats Perform’s 10 year-long exclusive official rights deal with Football DataCo. Under the agreement, the former body will continue to distribute event data to the media, fantasy sports companies, broadcasters and teams through the 2024/25 soccer season.</p>
<p>Stats Perform will also distribute official player tracking data to EPL, EFL and SPFL rightsholders and will provide deeper viewer insights into the sport. In addition, the company will distribute official player market data to licensed sports betting and daily fantasy companies, allowing them to enhance their products with cutting-edge statistics.</p>
<p>The English and Scottish leagues are an integral part of Stats Perform’s media and betting data portfolio. The company also distributes data for other top-flight European soccer leagues, such as Spain’s La Liga, France’s Ligue 1, Germany’s Bundesliga and Italy’s Serie A, among others.</p>
<p>Speaking of Serie A, the league just put betting rights packages up for sale.</p>
<p>Data Is Crucial to Creating Memorable On-Field Stories</p>
<p>Stats Perform’s chief commercial officer, Alex Rice, commented on the deal extension, expressing his company’s commitment to soccer data. He said that Stats Perform is always thinking carefully about what to collect and how to collect it, how to store data and how to distribute it and use it to help its customers create “memorable stories about the on-field action.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Stats Perform continues to develop new statistics, such as possession value, expected pass completion and momentum, Rice noted. These new additions, according to him, help to deepen fans’ emotional collection with their favorite teams and players.</p>
<p>Addressing the new deal, Rice said that his team is glad to have been recognized by Football DataCo.</p>
<p>We are honored that our investment in collecting, generating and distributing the fastest, most accurate detailed data with the utmost professionalism has again been recognized by Football DataCo. Alex Rice, CCO, Stats Perform</p>
<p>Football DataCo’s general manager, Adrian Ford, said that the extension of his company’s partnership with Stats Perform has been a no-brainer.</p>
<p>The value of data in building trusted fan and bettor experiences continues to grow, and that enhances the reputation of our competitions, wherever they are enjoyed. Adrian Ford, general manager, Football DataCo</p>
<p>Ford praised Stats Perform’s Opta solution as a “key enabler” for leagues’ stakeholders and fans who want the best data insights.</p>
<p>In July, Stats Perform was selected as the official data partner of two SFL leagues.</p>
