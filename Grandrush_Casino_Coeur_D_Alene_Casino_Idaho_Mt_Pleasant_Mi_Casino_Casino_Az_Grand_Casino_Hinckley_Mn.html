<p>White Hat Gaming is powering the rollout of Jackpocket Casino in New Jersey after the popular lottery ticket seller announced that it is branching out its business into iGaming with a dedicated online casino.</p>
<p>Self-billed as the leading lottery app in the United States, Jackpocket is using its ample experience in running digital operations and providing players with quick access to lottery tickets and now bringing this prowess to the online casino vertical.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming will provide the company with market-leading PAM services and will help Jackpocket spearhead the casino venture it launched through a tie-up with Caesars Interactive Entertainment New Jersey, LLC as previously reported by Casino Guru News.</p>
<p>Thanks to White Hat Gaming’s PAM, Jackpocket will benefit from a range of services that are directly integrated into the solution, including CRM marketing support, 24/7 customer support, a range of payment tools that facilitate the onboarding experience as well as withdrawing funds, and more.</p>
<p>Not only that but White Hat Gaming’s White Hat Studios developer arm is also injecting its games into the new casino, giving it a prompt start with titles such as Peaky Blinders and The Goonies, which have been a hit across the market in the United States.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity, Jackpocket CEO and Founder Peter Sullivan said that he was very excited to team up with White Hat Gaming and have the opportunity to make another decisive stride in the newly entered market in New Jersey.</p>
<p>"Alongside our platform partner White Hat Gaming, we’re excited to reaffirm our commitment to providing top-tier entertainment to new and existing audiences," Sullivan added. White Hat Gaming CEO Phil Gelvan was similarly pleased with the opportunity and welcomed the chance to see his company provide Jackpocket with the relevant technology to start the operator on its journey in iGaming and the Garden State.</p>
<p>"The launch also serves as another exciting development in the White Hat Gaming story, as we continue to expand across the U.S. market at pace. The journey will continue over the coming months, with more projects in the pipeline," Gelvan added, speaking highly of the robust PAM software that will power the experience moving forward.</p>
