<p>Bigger Bass Bonanza review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>It’s time to grab a swimsuit and a Hawaiian shirt because Bigger Bass Bonanza is heading to the tropics.</p>
<p>In this incarnation of the Big Bass franchise, players set out onto warmer waters. Plenty of colourful tackle and fish await beyond the palm trees.</p>
<p>This game is a good find for players who have enjoyed the previous slots in the Big Bass series, but newcomers will catch on in no time too.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The beachy soundtrack is layered with seagull calls, reminding players they are floating out on the ocean. The reels spin with a bubble sound effect that matches the slowly drifting bubbles between the reels.</p>
<p>Experienced players may recognize some of the fishing tackle symbols from previous games in the Big Bass series. Fishing rods, feathery lures, and the iconic leaping bass all make an appearance.</p>
<p>Given the exotic setting, it might have been fun to see a few new tropical fish make an appearance, but the cute fish symbols are a friendly sight.</p>
<p>The turquoise water behind the reels shows the shadows of palm trees, emphasizing the holiday feel of the game. In the distance, players will see a neon lit city and even more palms.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Bigger Bass Bonanza create a chilled out vacation vibe.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Bigger Bass Bonanza is a five reel, four row slot with 12 win lines.</p>
<p>The maximum win players can be awarded is x4,000 their total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. During the Free Spins feature, the Wild symbol appears on all the reels.</p>
<p>For every spin, the Money spin is given a random value. The game’s paying fish symbols also work as Money symbols, taking on values that can be won during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>If players land 3 Scatters or more, they trigger the Free Spins feature. The number of free spins that players receive increases with the number of Scatters triggering the feature:</p>
<p>Each Wild that lands during the Free Spins feature accumulates the values of the available Money symbols. Players accumulate all the Wild symbols until the end of the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Players can retrigger the Free Spins feature every time at least four Wilds are accumulated. When the feature is retriggered, the Money symbol multiplier also goes up. The maximum number of times the Free Spins feature can be retriggered is three.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.70%, nicely above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.12 up to a maximum of $/£/€240 per spin.</p>
