<p>5 Lions review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around emblematic animals, especially a golden lion.</p>
<p>The mystical creatures of this game bring to mind ancient Chinese sculptures. Glowing gold, dragons, frogs, turtles, fish, and of course the lion, gaze out front the reels.</p>
<p>Players will feel they’ve travelled back in time to an Asian city to play a magical game. The festive atmosphere makes it easy to get into the mood.</p>
<p>The portrayal of the Chinese style is certainly fantastical, but players will enjoy giving into the fun.</p>
<p>Win with the x8 multiplier</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The background music feels like the soundtrack of a classic film set in Asia, perhaps The King and I. The chimes, flutes and whimsical tune all set a distinctly exotic atmosphere.</p>
<p>The highlight is the animation of the golden animals upon wins. They expand, breathe and seem to come to life for the player. The lion is especially iconic as he frees himself from the confines of the reel.</p>
<p>The colourful palette and playful art style keep the atmosphere joyful, yet still magical. The dark background lets the bright frame of the reels stand out and brings players’ focus right to the symbols.</p>
<p>The overall aesthetic brings to mind a Macau casino with hot neon lights, icy cold drinks and mystery in the air.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>5 Lions is a five reel, three row slot.</p>
<p>This game uses the Any Way Wins system. This means that wins are awarded for matching symbols in adjacent reels from left to right.</p>
<p>During the base game, players have 243 ways to win, but this increases to 576 during the Free Spin Feature (see below for details).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. It only appears on reels 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p>A Multiplier is chosen at random each spin. All winning combinations containing one Wild or more are multiplied by the random chosen Multiplier at the end of the spin.</p>
<p>Players may receive Multipliers between x1 and x40.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol may appear on any reel.</p>
<p>Players can trigger the Free Spins Feature by landing 3, 4, or 5 Scatter symbols on adjacent reels. The player may receive the following:</p>
<p>3 Scatter symbols: x2 total bet</p>
<p>4 Scatter symbols: x5 total bet</p>
<p>5 Scatter symbols: x20 total bet</p>
<p>The Free Spins Feature also changes the shape of the reels, adding three additional symbols to the top of them. This increases the player's number of ways to win.</p>
<p>Plenty of choices for the free spins bonus game</p>
<p>When the Free Spin Feature begins, players choose a range of multipliers as part of the Free Spins Option. For every spin, a random multiplier will be selected from that range.</p>
<p>All winning combinations containing one or more Wild symbols are multiplied by the randomly selected multiplier value. This occurs after each free spin.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.5%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€250 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Full paytable for 5 Lions slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility lion-themed slot.</p>
<p>The strategy stats make this game a clearly good choice, but the mystical graphics and beautifully animated animals make it fun to visit.</p>
<p>The ample bonus options make it easy to stay engaged with the gameplay.</p>
