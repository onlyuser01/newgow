<p>The Detroit Lions vs. San Francisco 49ers is the 2024 NFC Championship Game. The game will take place at Levi’s Stadium on Sunday, January 28, 2024</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions are arguably the most pleasant surprise in football this season. With a young roster full of rookies, the Lions weren’t expected to go far but they now have a chance to win their first NFC Championship in the franchise’s history.</p>
<p>The bad news for them is that the San Francisco 49ers are standing in their way. These guys have been terrific throughout the 2023-24 campaign and are seen as 7-point favorites in Sunday’s game.</p>

<p>Can the Detroit Lions Upset the Odds on Sunday?</p>
<p>Led by rookie quarterback CJ Stroud, the Detroit Lions went 12-5 in the regular season. In the playoffs, they defeated the Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card Round 24-24, then went on to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31-23 in the Divisional Round.</p>
<p>One may argue that they were lucky to get two relatively easy games in the postseason, but the fact is that both the Rams and the Bucs were on form before facing them.</p>
<p>The Lions did, however, have a major advantage in those two games – they played in front of their fans at Ford Field. Now, they need to play in San Francisco, where they are without a single win against the Niners.</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers Determined to Win the NFC Championship</p>
<p>The 49ers are 7-point favorites to win the 2024 NFC Championship. Not only that but with the odds of +140, they’re the top favorites to win the Super Bowl. All that isn’t without reason. The Niners are arguably the most well-rounded team in the NFL.</p>
<p>They have a decent quarterback in Brock Purdy, who might not be the best signal-caller in the league but who’s got some fantastic teammates to help him take his game to the next level. On the receiving end, he’s got several great options, most notably tight end George Kittle.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, wide receiver Deebo Samuel picked up an injury against the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round, but the Niners have plenty of good backups to cover for him. They also have one of the best running backs in the world – Christian McCaffrey – as well as full-back Kyle Juszczyk.</p>
<p>Then, there’s their defensive team, with Nick Bosa as their standout player. These guys are the NFL’s third-best defense (behind Baltimore and Kansas City), conceding just 17.7 points per game.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions vs. San Francisco 49ers Prediction</p>
<p>We think the NFC Championship Game is where Detroit’s playoff journey ends. Even though the Lions have been a real joy to watch throughout the season, we just can’t see them do anything against the mighty Niners. San Francisco will win this game, probably covering the 7-point spread along the way.</p>
<p>Pick: San Francisco 49ers -7.0</p>
