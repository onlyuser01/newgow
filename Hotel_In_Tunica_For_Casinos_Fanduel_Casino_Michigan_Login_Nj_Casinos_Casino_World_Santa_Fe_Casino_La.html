<p>Here comes our Atlanta United vs Portland Timbers preview to help you learn about MLS odds and make the right betting choices for Saturday’s game</p>
<p>Atlanta United are sitting top of the Eastern Conference after three rounds of the 2023 MLS. They’re 2-1-0 at the moment and are hopeful of adding another victory to the list. At first glance, it seems that they should have no problems beating the Portland Timbers who are 1-0-2 so far, with back-to-back losses. However, those two losses happened against the top two teams from the Western Conference.</p>

<p>Atlanta United Look Like MLS Cup Contenders</p>
<p>Although it’s still early to predict what’s going to happen at the end of the season, this team does look like a potential candidate for the 2023 MLS Cup. Atlanta United got wins against the San Jose Earthquakes (2-1) and Charlotte (3-0), as well as one draw with Toronto FC (1-1).</p>
<p>You shouldn’t be surprised that they’re doing good in 2023, as they got the second-most expensive roster in the MLS. What should surprise you is that last season they failed to make the playoffs. This time, however, such a thing seems almost impossible to happen.</p>
<p>It’s because their young stars have grown and turned into real world-beaters. The best example is the Argentine World Cup-winning midfielder Thiago Almada who’s been playing at an MVP level since the start of the season. Atlanta’s 21-year-old playmaker has scored two goals so far, as well as made two assists.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Atlanta’s 18-year-old defender Caleb Wiley who’s coming off a vintage performance in Charlotte, which saw him score two goals and make one assist.</p>
<p>Portland Timbers are Better Than What Their Record Suggests</p>
<p>The Timbers started the season with a 1-0 win over Sporting Kansas City. It wasn’t a great game but the boys from Portland managed to do what they planned. Unfortunately for them, things didn’t go according to plan in the following two games. The Timbers lost to Los Angeles FC 3-2 and to St. Louis City 2-1.</p>
<p>Still, losing to St. Louis City and LAFC is nothing to be embarrassed about as those two are currently occupying the top two spots in the Western Conference. Plus, they managed to find the net in each of those games.</p>
<p>Atlanta United vs Portland Timbers Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a close game, but we’re certain it’s not going to be a boring one. In fact, we believe there will be plenty of goals in this match, probably on both ends. We also believe that Atlanta United will be the side to score more.</p>
<p>Pick: Atlanta United to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
