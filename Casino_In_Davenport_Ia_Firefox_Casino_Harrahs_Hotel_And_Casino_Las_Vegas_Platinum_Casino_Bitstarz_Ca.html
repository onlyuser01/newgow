<p>The leading advisory services provider, catering to the growing gambling vertical, SCCG Management, announced a new partnership with GG International's subsidiary, WhiteLotto. Details of the new partnership emerged earlier this week. The latest collaboration is expected to strengthen the presence of the two companies within the gambling and lottery sectors.</p>
<p>Per the new agreement, WhiteLotto will benefit from SCCG's network of partners and strong presence within the growing gambling industry. At the same time, SCCG's expertise in the sector will also help the company continue to expand the reach of its products and engage with new partners across the globe.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the collaboration is expected to bring benefits to SCCG Management as well. Teaming up with WhiteLotto, the company expands its portfolio of partners, while growing its product and solutions offering.</p>
<p>Wojciech Lysak, WhiteLotto's Managing Director, was excited about the new deal, explaining that the company is proud to join forces with a trusted partner such as SCCG Management. "WhiteLotto's business model was always to stay outside the flashlights, working from backstage in a peaceful and calm atmosphere delivering quality projects always on time, while being referred from project to project by word of mouth," he explained in a statement.</p>
<p>Finally, Lysak noted: "Having cooperation with SCCG, which in WhiteLotto's humble opinion is the industry superstar in terms of networking and connection of good businesses, WhiteLotto products can now be presented to a more broader audience of worldwide operators."</p>
<p>Stephen Crystal, SCCG Management's Founder and CEO, added that the deal with WhiteLotto represents an important achievement for the company. He pointed out:" WhiteLotto’s cutting-edge lottery platform and its global operational model perfectly align with our vision of connecting the industry’s best products and services."</p>
<p>Last but not least, Crystal said: "We are thrilled to collaborate with a company that has such a profound understanding of the lottery sector, and we look forward to bringing WhiteLotto’s exceptional offerings to our extensive network of clients."</p>
<p>Currently, WhiteLotto offers innovative solutions and a platform that caters to global lotteries. The one-stop solution is proven to benefit lotteries that are just launching, while at the same time, offering the needed marketing and technical support.</p>
<p>Moreover, WhiteLotto's solution offers an extensive affiliate program, along with marketing tools and is available in more than 40 languages, making it suitable for markets across the globe.</p>
