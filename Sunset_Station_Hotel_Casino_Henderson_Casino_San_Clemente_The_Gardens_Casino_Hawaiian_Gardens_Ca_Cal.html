<p>Evolution has doubled down on its expansion in Michigan through an agreement with Soaring Eagle Gaming. The deal will see Evolution supply the tribal operator with its online casino content.</p>
<p>Evolution Will Supply Soaring Eagle with Content</p>
<p>Soaring Eagle Gaming is a local tribal operator run by the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe. Thanks to its agreement with Evolution, the company will receive a variety of new games to offer to its customers. The aggregator will notably provide content from three brands, including its proprietary titles, as well as NetEnt’s and Red Tiger’s.</p>
<p>Both Playeagle.com, Soaring Eagle’s desktop website, and Eagle Casino &amp; Sports, the operator’s mobile app, will get new games. This means that both PC players and iOS users in Michigan will get to enjoy the new content.</p>
<p>In particular, fans will be able to play hit slot titles such as NetEnt’ Divine Fortune Megaways, Fruit Shop Megaways and Starburst or Red Tiger’s Gonzo’s Quest Megaways and Piggy Riches Megaways. Furthermore, casino enthusiasts will be able to enjoy live casino content and first-person RNG titles. The latter will be streamed from Evolution’s studio in Michigan.</p>
<p>The Tribal Operator Will Enhance Its Online Offerings</p>
<p>Jeff Millar, Evolution’s commercial director for North America, commented on the deal. He said that his team is glad to power Soaring Eagle Casino with Evolution’s diverse selection of slots and live casino content. According to him, players will “be able to immerse themselves in a uniquely entertaining experience” no matter where in Michigan they are.</p>
<p>Melinda Coffin, the chief executive officer of Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort, also shared her thoughts on the agreement. She emphasized that the tribal brand prides itself on offering the hottest gaming action in the Midwest. Thanks to its agreement with Evolution, it will now offer the same unparalleled experience to online players as well.</p>
<p>Now our players will be able to experience the same thrill online, not only playing the casino classics but also exciting and entertaining game show-style games. We are confident that customers old and new are going to love what is the latest in a long line of Soaring Eagle developments. Melinda Coffin, CEO, Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort</p>
<p>The Saginaw Chippewa Tribe currently operates the Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort in the city of Mount Pleasant. It also offers iGaming on its desktop website and through its mobile app.</p>
<p>Evolution, on the other hand, recently reported that its profits have grown by 50% in the first quarter of the year. This follows Evolution’s record-breaking revenues from 2021.</p>
