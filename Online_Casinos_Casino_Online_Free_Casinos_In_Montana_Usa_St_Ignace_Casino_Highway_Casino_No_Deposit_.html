<p>The fast-growing iGaming operator, Swintt, announced a new partnership with the provider of engaging and innovative sports betting games, ParlayBay. Details of the new content integration and distribution deal emerged Monday. Under the terms of the new partnership, games from ParlayBay will become available for Swintt's customers.</p>
<p>Per the new deal, the operator will gain access to popular games from the portfolio of the iGaming provider such as Stack 'Em, as well as other popular esports titles. Thanks to the new deal, Swintt's partners will tap into new and engaging titles that transform "conventional sports betting markets by creating a game-changing experience for the players," a statement released on April 3, 2023, reveals.</p>
<p>Besides expanding the offering of Swintt, the new collaboration enables ParlayBay's titles to reach new audiences. As a fast-growing provider of online casino games, Swintt offers more than 150 table games as well as slots. Now, the award-winning provider will further boost its offering and deliver engaging experiences for its clients.</p>
<p>The deal with ParlayBay brought excitement to Swintt's CEO, David Mann. Commenting on the topic, he pointed out: "ParlayBay is one of the most innovative and exciting providers of sports betting content in the iGaming industry right now and weâ€™re thrilled to be able to offer their unique range of games to our casino partners going forward."</p>
<p>The new partnership comes after late last month, Swintt entered into a content deal with PressEnter. Under the terms of that collaboration, the operator tapped into the extensive range of casino games provided by Swintt.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in March, the company inked a deal with the leading iGaming operator Jokerstar. That deal saw Swintt expand further the reach of its content by delivering its library of games to customers of the operator.</p>
<p>Besides the engaging games from ParlayBay, Swintt will benefit from the company's unique promotional tool kit, which helps with player acquisition and retention. As a result, Swintt will gain access to ParlayBay's ParlayPowers, a solution that boosts the customers' experience by delivering free bets, early bird bonuses, cash drops and other engaging features.</p>
<p>Patrick Nordwall, ParlayBay's CEO, shared his excitement regarding the new partnership with Swintt saying: "Swintt is one of the up-and-coming aggregators in the market and has a fantastic product."</p>
<p>Finally, he explained: "We are very excited to finally be able to announce this partnership, with a company that shares our vision for innovation in the online gaming industry."</p>
