<p>The Panther City Lacrosse Club announced a new deal with PlayUp on Tuesday this week.</p>
<p>The newest National Lacrosse League (NLL) expansion team in Fort Worth, Texas, the Panther City Lacrosse Club, revealed a ground-breaking partnership with PlayUp, the leading betting entertainment and technology company. Under the terms of the new agreement, the company was selected as Panther City’s first sports gaming partner.</p>
<p>Moreover, the new collaboration sees PlayUp become a fantasy sports partner, founding partner, as well as esports partner of the team. Currently, this is considered to be the largest-ever team sponsorship agreement in the history of NLL.</p>
<p>What is more, the new deal will feature a market access element. This means that if lawmakers in Texas legalize sports betting, the partnership may secure PlayUp access to the state. As with any regulated market, a sports betting license which the Panther City would need to receive would be subject to relevant regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Besides an opportunity to access the sports betting market in Texas if it gets legalized, the new sponsorship deal will raise awareness for PlayUp’s brand in the state. As a result, the company will benefit from brand exposure by placing its logo on the team’s jersey.</p>
<p>Moreover, PlayUp will benefit from in-stadium branding at the main entrance. Board signage during the regular and post-season home games and on-field logos will also help increase brand exposure.</p>
<p>The new collaboration will bring VIP hospitality for sports fans in Texas, further reaffirming PlayUp’s already unique service offering. Last but not least, the company will benefit from media branding opportunities during locally broadcasted games.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement for the Duo</p>
<p>Dennis Drazin, PlayUp USA’s recently appointed chairman, outlined that the company is excited to team up with Panther City. He explained that this deal represents a great opportunity for the company to help it grow and connect with fans in Texas. Drazin added that if lawmakers green light sports betting in the state, the collaboration would ensure PlayUp is “positioned to maximize that opportunity.”</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to welcome PlayUp as a partner of Panther City Lacrosse Club.” Greg Bibb, president, CEO and managing partner of Panther City Lacrosse Club</p>
<p>Panther City’s president, CEO and managing partner, Greg Bibb, added that it is thrilling to join forces with PlayUp. He outlined that the team is looking forward to introducing the brand to its fans. In conclusion, Gregg said that the team is proud to wear PlayUp’s logo on their jerseys.</p>
