<p>Global sports betting operator and Kindred Group brand Unibet continues to build upon its partnership with NFL franchise Pittsburgh Steelers with the launch of a new themed casino game that has launched in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The pair struck an alliance back in August when Unibet became the official sports partner for the team. The new casino game is a live dealer experience that will help online casino players in the Keystone State experience the classic version of blackjack while giving it a bit of a fan twist.</p>
<p>Playing Live Blackjack with Pittsburgh Steelers</p>
<p>To deliver on this experience, Unibet has contracted the services of Evolution, a global behemoth in the live dealer casino experience. As a result, players will have access to the best live dealer broadcast from Evolution’s dedicated studios and deliver on a bonafide Steelers experience.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Kindred SVP US Manuel Stan argued that the group is happy to expand on its product offering with the Steelers and add a themed blackjack game to the Unibet casino portfolio in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“Our Pennsylvania customers are highly engaged with both our casino and sportsbook products and deserve a best-in-class experience. Through this game, we’re able to provide them with a new, interactive way to play with Unibet.”</p>
<p>Unibet has been actively improving the experience for Pittsburgh fans. The sportsbook has been able to introduce fans to the Unibet Tailgate Zone during home games and facilitated meet-ups between fans and team legends. Unibet continues to build upon this momentum by adding the Steelers Mount Rushmore sweepstakes, which allows fans to get autographs from their favorite Pittsburgh legend and make a quick visit to the Steelers Hall of Honor.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks Teaming up with Various Operators</p>
<p>The Steelers have been wooed by many suitors over the past months. The team shortlisted BetMGM as its official gaming partner back in 2020. Meanwhile, partnerships between sportsbooks and prominent organizations have been proliferating.</p>
<p>DraftKings became a partner for the National Hockey League and Turner Sports. Individual sportsbooks such as Betway have sought to secure various prominent deals with sports franchises, such as the Philadelphia 76ers, in a bid to boost awareness and deliver on a range of experiences focusing fully on sports fans. Kindred teamed up with the Quechan Tribe to push the brand in Arizona as Unibet pursues new market activations and develops its footprint across the United States.</p>
