<p>Hampton Inn, Palms Under Fire for Failing to Prevent Teen Sex Trafficking</p>

<p>According to litigation filed this week, staff at the Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin and Palms Casino Resort didn’t stop concerning sexual activity involving a 16-year-old.</p>

<p>The teenage girl, who was given the pseudonym of Sarah in the lawsuit, was allegedly taken to the Hampton Inn for sexual activity beginning in 2019. These incidents occurred as often as several times a week. The encounters typically involved the same man, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.</p>
<p>The suit claims hotel employees observed her but did not take action to stop the interactions.</p>
<p>The staff did appear to notice her — to the point that Sarah texted her traffickers about the receptionist staring at her and how scared it made her,” the lawsuit stated. “Yet, at no point during Sarah’s year of suffering did any Hampton Inn employee even ask Sarah what she was doing there.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit further alleges that the girl and two other victims were invited to the Palms for a photoshoot by men they met men at a local concert. When they arrived at the hotel, the men attempted to get them to act in a pornographic film, the Review-Journal reported.</p>
<p>The girls fled the hotel. One of the girls later revealed the incident to her mother, who telephoned the casino’s security office.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in Clark County District Court, names the owners of the Hampton Inn, a Hilton brand, and Hilton-related companies. It also was filed against Red Rock Resorts, which owned the Palms in 2019, and current owners, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians. The alleged trafficker is also named.</p>
<p>What’s Next</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. If the case proceeds to trial, evidence likely will be presented about any suffering the teenage victim endured from the alleged incidents.</p>
<p>The firm argues there is a broader issue related to the allegations.</p>
<p>We believe the Nevada Legislature addressed an important societal issue by enacting laws against human trafficking,” Attorney Michael Kane, who represents the plaintiff, said in an email to the Review-Journal. “We aim to ensure these laws are faithfully carried out.”</p>
<p>A likely next step in the litigation is the parties named in the lawsuit will file responses to the allegations made in the complaints.</p>
<p>Casino.org reached out to the Palms, Hilton, Red Rock Resorts, and the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians for comment. No immediate statements were released.</p>
<p>The 702 Firm, located in Las Vegas, represents the plaintiff.</p>
