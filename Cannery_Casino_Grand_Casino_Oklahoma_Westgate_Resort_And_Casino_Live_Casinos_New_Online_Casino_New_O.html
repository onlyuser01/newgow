<p>Information about South African casinos</p>
<p>The legality of online gambling in South Africa is still shrouded in controversy, and domestic operators are prohibited from offering casino games, at the time of writing.</p>
<p>However, there's nothing stopping South African players from playing casino games on foreign sites, and many do. If you're one of them, then you'll probably want to see which new offshore casinos you can access from your computer and mobile device.</p>
<p>After all, the choice of South Africa casinos is growing. While the list of new online casinos in South Africa for 2021 and 2022 was extensive, the list for 2024 is bigger still. SA players now have new online casinos to choose from almost every day, where they can play games like roulette, blackjack, or virtual slots.</p>
<p>On this page, we at Casino Guru list and explain more about the best new online casinos and bonuses in South Africa. We'll also show you how you can make use of our Safety Index, review, and filter system to find the best option for you.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Pros and cons of new online casinos in South Africa</p>
<p>New online casinos can provide players with mixed feelings. Yes, they're fresh and exciting, but they also present some risks, especially for players who aren't used to them. Here we want to go through some of the pros and cons to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First up, any new casino that is offering its wares to SA players is sure to want to grab their attention in order to build its market share. This means that attractive-sounding casino bonuses are very common at new casinos. This can include a large amount of prepaid spins or a certain amount of bonus credit.</p>
<p>The flip side to this is that there may be hidden (or non-obvious) details built into these bonuses, whereby you can only use them on certain games, or you can only withdraw a maximum amount of winnings. We advise you to keep an eye out for these, and we'll show you how to do this later on.</p>
<p>Another potential plus with new casinos is that they're likely to offer the latest games or, at least, modern games with cool playing features. They'll likely be a refreshing alternative to fusty old casino sites that stick to tried-and-tested formulas.</p>
<p>Yet, there is one last disadvantage to look out for. The newer a casino is, the less evidence we have to go on about whether it can be trusted or not. This means new casinos are always something of an unknown quantity, so we urge you to always treat them with caution when signing up.</p>
<p>Of course, what we do know we'll pass on to you in the form of ratings and reviews. In the next section, we'll show you how you can make use of these as your quest to find the best new online casino begins.</p>
<p>How to choose the best new online casino in South Africa for you</p>
<p>At the top of this page, you'll find a list of the newest online casinos available to South African players, but knowing how to choose the right casino can make the difference between a pleasant playing experience and an awful one.</p>
<p>To increase your chances of the former happening, Casino Guru's expert team has assessed many of the casinos on this list and assigned them a Safety Index to give you an idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>Be warned, though, some of these sites are so fresh that we just haven't had a chance to look at them yet: these will be marked with a 'Fresh online casino' status, meaning that you should treat these casinos with caution.</p>
<p>Those that we have rated, however, will have a Safety Index that incorporates the following important features:</p>
<p>The fairness of its terms and conditions</p>
<p>The fairness of its terms and conditions</p>
<p>Its revenue levels (high revenue means the more likely it is to pay out big wins)</p>
<p>You'll see the casinos with the highest Safety Index at the top of the list, and we recommend that you start with these.</p>
<p>There are also a series of filters that allow you to reduce the selection of new casinos. Most new sites, for example, will be mobile-friendly, but you can make sure you exclude all non-mobile casinos by ticking the 'Mobile-friendly casinos' box. You may want to ensure that the casino you choose accepts your preferred currency and/or payment method, in which case you just choose your option from either filter, like the South African Rand and PayPal.</p>
<p>Other filters include 'Casino Games', where you can choose to see just South Africa sites that offer certain casino games; 'Licensing Authority', to view those with a gaming license of your choice; and 'Game Provider', just in case you'd only like to see casinos with games from your favorite developer.</p>
<p>Once you've finished playing around with these filters, you'll have a refined list of new casinos for SA players to choose from.</p>
<p>South Africa new online casino bonuses</p>
<p>It's not just new casinos that can grab a player's attention, but new casino bonuses, too. These can be nice ways to check out a new site.</p>
<p>To do that, though, you'll need to look for the best possible bonus, which you can do by applying for certain filters on our list of online casino bonuses where you can find the freshest bonuses under the 'Latest' tab.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important filter is the bonus type. This will let you sort between the two most popular types: the deposit bonus (which you get after putting money into your casino account) and no deposit bonuses (that you get just for signing up). You may also see new reload and cashback bonuses, which are effectively types of deposit bonuses that you might get later on in your player membership.</p>
<p>There are other filter options to help you narrow the list down further, if you wish. These include:</p>
<p>Wagering requirements (WR) - the conditions you must meet in order to access any bonus winnings</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the conditions you must meet in order to access any bonus winnings Bonus value - what your bonus is worth, in terms of currency, percentage bonus value, and number of free spins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what your bonus is worth, in terms of currency, percentage bonus value, and number of free spins. Bonus type - the kinds of bonuses that we've already mentioned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like with online casinos, it's important that you find the best bonus for you. For more help on this matter, our special guide to casino bonuses has everything you need to know on this topic.</p>
