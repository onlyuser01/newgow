<p>Dear Magill,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I’m sure that you are aware of geolocation of GAMSTOP operation:</p>
<p>"GAMSTOP lets you put controls in place to help restrict your online gambling activities.</p>
<p>Sign up for the service and you will be prevented from using gambling websites and apps run by companies licensed in Great Britain, for a period of your choosing."</p>
<p>Since you have chosen casino without a license, it will be very difficult to resolve this case to your satisfaction. However, before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’s closure. My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked Responsible Gaming section on the website, and this is what I found https://24monaco.com/templates/company/responsible_gaming:</p>
<p>„ Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>Self- Exclusion is a more extensive way to control your activity at 24monaco.com.</p>
<p>Self-exclusion means that you decide to close your account for a period up to 3 months. In case you wish to Self- Exclude your account, please contact our Customer Support Team who will be happy to assist you."</p>
<p>"Provided that Your Account does not show that a balance id is due to us, You are entitled to close your Account and terminate the Terms &amp; Conditions on not less than twenty four hours’ notice to us at any time by contacting us through our Customer Services. We will respond to your request confirming closure of Your Account and the date on which such closure will be effective, within a reasonable time, provided that You continue to assume responsibility for all activity on Your Account until such closure has been carried out by us (at which point the Terms &amp; Conditions shall terminate)."</p>
<p>Is this the email address that you have sent your email to?</p>
<p>support@24monaco.com</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
