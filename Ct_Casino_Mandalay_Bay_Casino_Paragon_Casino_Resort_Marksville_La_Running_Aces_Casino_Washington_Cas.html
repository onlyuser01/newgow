<p>Cambodia’s NagaWorld Casino will reopen doors on July 8. The operator has received a certificate, allowing it to resume operations. With that being said, the casino is still going to follow strict health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>July 8 Marks the Day When VIP Tables and Slots at NagaWorld Start Operating</p>
<p>NagaCorp Ltd has announced that it will be reopening NagaWorld Casino’s doors in Cambodia. The VIP tables and slots will be allowed to start operating from July 8. The company has announced that it received allowance from the Cambodian Ministry of Health to restart the operations of its VIP tables and slot machines. In order to receive an approval, NagaWorld’s gaming venue in Phnom Penh, the capital, was inspected by the ministry on July 4. Following the inspection, a certificate allowing the operator to resume operations was issued.</p>
<p>Currently, the total number of reported COVID-19 cases in Cambodia is 141. Out of that total, some 131 have already recovered and the country hasn’t seen a COVID-19 related death of a patient. Cambodia’s casinos were ordered to shut down back in April. This was an effort of the kingdom to reduce the spread of COVID-19. With that being said, last week Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has said that casinos will be cleared to reopen their doors considering that they meet health and safety guidelines. Keeping this in mind, it’s important to mention that in Cambodia there are more than 100 land-based casinos.</p>
<p>The kingdom’s casinos are regulated by the General Department of Financial Industry. The regulator’s director-general, Mey Vann said that NagaWorld was actually the first operator to request resuming of operations. Vann further outlined: “No other casino has submitted a letter asking to reopen because their owners have yet to prepare their establishments for it. Casinos along the Thai and Vietnamese borders also have not reopened.“</p>
<p>Enhanced Health and Safety Protocols Valid for All Operators</p>
<p>Although NagaWorld has set to reopen its doors for visitors on July 8, some restrictions will be introduced. All guests and visitors will have to mandatory wear a mask. Both employees and visitors will have their temperature checked prior to entering the casino floors. Masks are to be mandatory for visitors even when they are playing games.</p>
<p>NagaWorld’s capacity is also reduced. The slot machine capacity is reduced to only 50%, which makes every other machine turned off. This restriction will ensure that social distancing is followed between the casino’s guests. Aside from the slots, the table games will also operate with restricted capacity to only 43%. Each table will be limited to a maximum of three players. NagaWorld has also set up 5 rooms which can be used as “quarantine areas” in case a visitor shows symptoms of being sick.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the country, news outlets reported that schools in the country are expected to reopen in August. According to the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, this will be completed in a three-stage plan for reopening of the school premises. According to education ministry spokesman Ros Soveacha further details are going to be released later this week.</p>
