<p>Wazdan has launched the energy-efficient version of its iconic Hot Slot: 777 Cash Out slot that will expand players’ gaming sessions by reducing battery drain</p>
<p>The innovative games provider that delivers best-in-class iGaming solutions and releases over 40 unique slots each year, Wazdan, has given its player-favorite Hot Slot: 777 Cash Out game an interesting makeover.</p>
<p>The new Extremely Light eco-friendly variant of the slot lets players enjoy longer gaming sessions thanks to the lighter graphics used by the studio. In turn, this makes it more energy-efficient while optimizing it for mobile by considerably rescuing the battery drain.</p>
<p>In June, the company also hit the refresh button on its 9 Coins collection with the release of the Grand Platinum Edition.</p>

<p>5 Rows: 3</p>

<p>min: 0.20, max: 1,000 Volatility: Medium-High</p>
<p>Medium-High Release date: September 28, 2023</p>
<p>Cash Out, Chance Level, and Grand Jackpot Features</p>
<p>Commenting on the fresh release, the company’s chief commercial officer, Andrzej Hyla, has expressed their excitement about their ability to add another leading title to their iconic Extremely Light collection.</p>
<p>Hyla believes that by preserving the initial mechanics of the original slot that has already recorded high rates of success among players, the new version is “sure to go down a treat” with global slot aficionados.</p>
<p>The CCO also spoke about the continuous need to turn the iGaming world into a “more accessible” one while positioning themselves at the forefront with its premium releases.</p>
<p>Hot Slot: 777 Cash Out Extremely Light includes the Cash Out feature that allows players to accumulate and pay out wins based on the Cash and Jackpot symbols found in the base game. Regular cash prize symbols feature values ranging from 1x to 10x the stake. Mini, Major, and Mega jackpot symbols are worth 20x, 50x, and 100x the stake.</p>
<p>In the lighter variant of the game, the Cash Out symbol has been designed to resemble a golden safe. Players receive the 1,500x Grand Jackpot provided they manage to exclusively fill up the entire grid with cash prizes and/or jackpot symbols.</p>
<p>The Chance Level feature has also been brought back. The feature lets players double their base bets and boost the odds of landing Jackpot symbols.</p>
<p>The same feature increases players’ potential of coming across the Grand Jackpot by covering all 15 reel positions with Jackpot symbols. The Chance Level ante bet will not influence the values of the paytable symbols.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Wazdan announced the launch of the Mystery Fall network promotion with a total prize pool of €2.5 million.</p>
<p>In August, Wazdan announced the release of Mighty Symbols: Crowns, a fresh slot with innovative mechanics after inking a partnership with NetBet Italy, an important iGaming operator in the country.</p>
