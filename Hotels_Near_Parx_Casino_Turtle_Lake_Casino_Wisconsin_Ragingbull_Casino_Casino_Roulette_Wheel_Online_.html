<p>Piggy Tap review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Piggy Tap is a unique instant-win game that has been designed and developed by Onlyplay. This multiplayer online game is themed around attempting to smash a giant piggy bank in order to get your hands on the money inside.</p>
<p>Graphics Sounds, and Animation</p>
<p>Pigs have long been seen as a source of wealth in online slots and other games. Titles like Piggy Riches by NetEnt and Piggy Bank Bills by Pragmatic Play have highlighted pigs as creatures surrounded by wealth.</p>
<p>In Piggy Tap, Onlyplay has tapped into the popular image of the piggy bank, positing a giant one on top of a stack of gold coins that is fit to burst with money. The game comes to life with some great animations as you see all of the online players chipping away at the structure of the pig. It slowly cracks and collapses into the mountain, with a giant fountain of gold coins bursting from it when it finally breaks.</p>

<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>When you load up the Piggy Tap game, you might be a little confused as to what to do. The aim of the game is simple: you need to tap on the pig to see if it is going to pay out. The game is multiplayer, so there are other people doing this at the same time as you, and many of them will display with little avatars around the screen.</p>
<p>When you tap on the pig, it might create a split, and it could pay out. All payouts are rewarded as multipliers of your current stake. You can win the following multipliers: x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x11, x12, x13, x14, x15, x30, x40, x50, or x100. The win is automatically paid out.</p>
<p>As we have seen in popular crash games like Aviator, you will also be able to see what other players have won, with their winning appearing over their avatars. This creates a fun community element to the game, as you all work away to try and win bigger prizes.</p>

<p>Wild, Bonuses, and Free Spins</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of instant-win games, Only Play has injected some extra life into Piggy Tap with some bonus features.</p>
<p>Firstly, you might notice the rim of a wheel at the top of the screen. This is the Fortune Wheel, and it displays multipliers of x2, x10, x100, and x1,000 in its sectors. In order to be able to spin the wheel, you will need to reveal it. This is done by collecting Horseshoe symbols, which can be rewarded on any tap. The more Horseshoe symbols, the more visible the wheel.</p>
<p>On any random tap, the Free Spin mini slot may become available. This is a mini 1x3 reel set that appears under the pig. You will be given one spin of the reels. This will determine how many free taps you get and a multiplier that will be applied to your win.</p>
<p>Free spins are awarded randomly in Piggy Tap game</p>
<p>Finally, there are three progressive jackpots that can be won on any random tap. The Minor, Major, and Grand.</p>
<p>Bet Size, RTP &amp; Variance</p>
<p>The Piggy Tap RTP is 96.98%, which puts it comfortably above the industry average, with very few games getting that close to 97%. While not a slot, this is perfect to play according to our slot strategy guide. The maximum win in the game is the Grand jackpot, which is a progressive jackpot displayed above the pig at all times.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Piggy Tap is a really fun instant-win game that offers something totally different from your standard online slot or game experience. The addition of bonus features makes it feel as though you are not just tapping away endlessly, and the community elements, most notably the combined efforts to break the pig, help this game feel incredibly engaging. Overall, this is an excellent instant-win game.</p>
