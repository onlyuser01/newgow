<p>Kalamba Games Signs Partnership with 888casino</p>
<p>The terms of the collaboration will see Kalamba Games deliver its slots games portfolio for customers of 888casino in multiple regions. This strategic collaboration will help the game developer grow its reach. At the same time, 888casino customers will benefit from gaining access to popular games from Kalamba Games such as Crystal Cavern, Joker Leprechauns, Joker Max, Blazing Bull 2 and Firedrake’s Fortune.</p>
<p>“Delivering our games to such a prestigious and well-known operator like 888casino, demonstrates Kalamba’s ambitious growth trajectory both this year and going forward.” Andrew Crosby, chief commercial officer at Kalamba Games</p>
<p>Kalamba Games’ chief commercial officer, Andrew Crosby, shared his excitement about the recent deal. He explained that launching its content with a respected operator like 888casino reaffirms Kalamba’s ambitious plan to continue growing this year. Moreover, Crosby said the company is excited to see how its games are going to be received by the 888casino players. In conclusion, he said Kalamba is “thrilled by this landmark achievement.”</p>
<p>“This partnership with Kalamba Games will add more innovative slots to our portfolio, aligning with our product and content leadership strategy.” Talya Benyamini, VP of B2C casino at 888casino</p>
<p>888casino’s VP of B2C casino, Talya Benyamini, acknowledged that 888 operates globally. She explained that players of the brand expect high-quality games. According to Benyamini, the new collaboration with Kalamba Games will bring new content for 888casino customers, which reaffirms the company’s content strategy.</p>
<p>The Game Developer Remains Committed to Growth</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Kalamba Games’ current focus is offering slots and casino content for real money gambling within regulated markets. The game developer quickly grew as a leading content technology provider that offers highly-successful slot titles as well as multiple promotional tools.</p>
<p>The new collaboration between the company and 888casino complements multiple other strategic deals. Last week, Kalamba released a sequel of one of its most popular slots, Goblins &amp; Gemstones. Earlier this month, Kalamba extended its partnership with Betsson Group. This resulted in Betsson players gaining access to Kalamba’s leading slot portfolio of more than 50 games offering unique features and mechanics.</p>
<p>Before joining forces with Betsson, Kalamba inked another major deal with Big Time Gaming. The collaboration was announced early in May and brought the popular Megaways mechanics to Kalamba’s portfolio of games.</p>
