<p>The Heat lead the series 3-1, meaning that they just need to beat the Bucks once more to knock them out of the playoffs. Can they do it in Milwaukee? Fiserv Forum is the place where Game 4 of the Heat vs Bucks series takes place on Wednesday, April 26</p>
<p>Milwaukee’s superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo was struggling with injury, which is why he missed two of the playoff games. He made his comeback on Monday with a decent performance, but that didn’t help the Bucks avoid losing. Now, he needs to do even better to help his team stay in the playoffs. So, can they beat the Heat on Wednesday evening?</p>

<p>The Heat Might Not Be Too Great Away from Home</p>
<p>The Miami Heat are 3-1 in the playoffs, with two of those wins happening in Florida. Now, they’re traveling to Wisconsin, which is where they won one game of the series. It happened last week, and it was their first win at Fiserv Forum since October 2019.</p>
<p>In fact, the Heat aren’t famous as a team that usually does well on the road. In the regular season, for example, they went 17-24 in away games. In comparison, their home record was 27-14.</p>
<p>Giannis Is Back!</p>
<p>Giannis Antetokounmpo is back after missing two games. On his comeback, the Greek Freak scored 26 points, while also recording 10 rebounds and 13 assists. It wasn’t enough to save his team from losing – the Heat beat them 119-114.</p>
<p>Giannis did well, but he wasn’t the Bucks’ top scorer that day. Instead, it was center Brook Lopez who scored 36 points. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton also did okay, but they will need to up their form even more in order to get a win on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Miami Heat vs Milwaukee Bucks Prediction</p>
<p>The Milwaukee Bucks have no other option but to give their utmost on Wednesday. And when give their maximum, they usually win. That said, we expect them to blow out the Heat, covering the spread along the way.</p>
<p>Pick: Milwaukee Bucks to win and cover the spread.</p>
