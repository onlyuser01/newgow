    <h1>Bitcoin Casino Casino Slots Real Money San Jose Casino Morongo Casino Room Rates Cherokee Casino Bet</h1>

<p>Hi Guru,</p>
<p>it has become apparent that this method is possible, but I did not use this feature. I agreed to use their site under the impression that it was not user controlled and that support would have to make the adjustments. When I raised this with them, they have said that I must have changed the limits but provided no proof other than when the limits were removed.</p>
<p>i have explained to them that I did not want the limits removed, but they will not even investigate how this has happened and they dismiss any idea that it is a system error.</p>
<p>i explained that if limits were not removed by their support, then according to the terms I agreed to, they should not have been removed. Their response to that has simply been to change the terms and conditions to the ones you have just quoted. See the attached photos of the terms I agreed to, and the revised terms they’ve updated just this week.</p>
<p>they have added in the information that the users can change their own limits, but I would’ve not signed up if this had it been clear originally. I wanted the protection from having to go via their support and these terms promised that, only to end up being false.</p>
<p>in my view, they have breached their terms, then altered them, and then provided no proof that I am at fault and refuse to investigate further.</p>
