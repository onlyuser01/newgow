    <h1>Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs La Casina Dc Facebook Doubleu Casino Mgm Casino Detroit Michigan Luc</h1>

<p>Oh well, I'm very sorry that this situation has arisen. Here's how we feel about the max bet issue: The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we think that this rule should be enforced at software level, i.e., that the casino's software or website shouldn't let players place higher bets than the limit. This is one of our requirements for 'fair and safe casinos'.</p>
<p>If software enforcement is not possible, each case should be judged separately. Additionally, the max bet sizes should be clearly displayed, ideally in the casino lobby or directly in the games (if possible).</p>
<p>So from what you can see, we are also of the opinion that it would be nice if the casinos had it covered, which unfortunately is not the situation in most cases. If you ever want to know more about how we perceive different situations, take a look at our fair gambling codex.</p>
<p>Anyway, I saw that you have opened a complaint and I'm curious how it will turn out in the end. We are currently waiting for the casino to respond, so we'll see what the answer will be. Fingers crossed ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž</p>
