<p>Shimmering Woods review</p>
<p>Shimmering Woods is themed around an enchanted forest.</p>
<p>Players will wander into a grove of trees filled with magic, where the ground is covered in mysterious crystals. If players can collect enough of these precious gems, they might just learn a spell or two.</p>
<p>This slot is a great choice for players who enjoy fantasy, and those who are fans of gem-themed games.</p>
<p>Win with the Split symbols in the Shimmering Woods slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The lighthearted soundtrack is filled with ethereal notes that uphold the fantasy theme. The reels land with a soft clunk as though they are made of wood, which also feels consistent with the forest setting.</p>
<p>The symbols on the reels include stylized letters carved into wood, and a variety of crystals in shades of blue, red, purple, and green. The stones are animated to appear luminous as they catch the light, adding to their allure.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, a peaceful wood can be seen, with mushrooms growing on the tree trunks and leaves lazily falling from the branches. Crystals emerge jagged from the ground, as if they form naturally in this otherworldly place.</p>
<p>Low paying symbols paytable</p>
<p>Overall, the music and animation create a welcoming fantasy world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Shimmering Woods is a five-reel, three-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols disappear after paying out, making way for new symbols to fall into their place.</p>
<p>High paying symbols paytable</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Players begin playing Shimmering Woods with a win multiplier of 1x, but for every Cascade, this multiplier increases.</p>
<p>During every spin, one of the symbols is chosen at random to have the special property of splitting itself into two. This increases the potential for winning combinations.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Scatters, the Free Spins feature begins. The triggering Scatters have the potential to split, increasing the total number of free spins awarded:</p>
<p>3 Scatters = 10 free spins and 1 Splitting Scatter</p>
<p>= 10 free spins and 1 Splitting Scatter 4 Scatters = 13 free spins and 2 Splitting Scatters</p>
<p>= 13 free spins and 2 Splitting Scatters 5 Scatters = 16 free spins and 3 Splitting Scatters</p>
<p>= 16 free spins and 3 Splitting Scatters 6 Scatters = 19 free spins and 4 Splitting Scatters</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, as many as 10 Splitting symbols may become active, and players can win up to 25,000x their total bet.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
