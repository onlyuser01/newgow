    <h1>Casino Joplin Mo Lake Tahoe Casinos Hotels Sloto Cash Casino Login 29 Palms Casino Kewadin Casino St</h1>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>On May 13th, 2021, I was lucky to have won a significant amount, namely EUR €857.000 of winnings in the online casino "BooCasino", registered with the MGA under the following:</p>
<p>"Boo Casino is owned and operated by Green Feather Online Limited, a company registered under the laws of Malta with Company Number C80735, with its registered address at NO. 40, TRIQ L-UQIJA, SWIEQI, Malta and licensed to provide gaming services under License No. MGA/B2C/445/2017, issued on 16 January 2019, by the Malta Gaming Authority."</p>
<p>The maximum amount to be paid out each month by BooCasino is EUR 5,000. This is conform their general terms and conditions.</p>
<p>However, due to this restriction it will take 13 years to 14 years for the complete amount to be paid out.</p>
<p>This concern I have discussed with the support desk, who communicated that the issue has been discussed with their management, of the casino and I even suggested to settle the complete amount faster by settling with the casino for a smaller amount.</p>
<p>Referring to Article 30 (1) (a) of the Player Protection Directive 2018 the following is applicable to a imposed withdrawal restriction:</p>
<p>"Provided that, for the purpose of determining whether a withdrawal restriction is unreasonable, the Authority shall consider the amount stipulated within the withdrawal request, in relation to the time which will be taken in order for the player to successfully withdraw all the funds he delineated in the request, and to the monetary withdrawal limit imposed on the player."</p>
<p>In my opinion the withdrawal restriction imposed by BooCasino is unreasonable and the amount to be paid out in relation to the time which will be taken to successfully withdraw all the funds is unreasonably long.</p>
<p>Considering the above, I would like to request you to look at this dispute between me and the casino and determine who of the parties is right and what would be a reasonable amount to be paid out each month by BooCasino, or tell me what the options are for me…</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Rik van R***</p>
