<p>The Mega Millions jackpot for this Friday, July 22, is an estimated $630 million. The generation-changing sum up for grabs is the fifth-largest prize in the interstate lottery game’s history.</p>

<p>The fifth-largest Mega Millions jackpot of all time also marks only the fifth time that the game’s top prize has exceeded $600 million. No ticket has matched all five white balls and the gold Mega Ball since the April 15 drawing.</p>
<p>Last night’s winning numbers were 2-31-32-37-70 and the Mega Ball 25.</p>
<p>To win the Mega Millions jackpot, a ticket must match all five white balls out of a possible 70 numbers, plus the gold ball out of 25 possible numbers. The odds of doing so are a measly one in 302.6 million.</p>
<p>With no jackpot win last night, the Mega Millions jackpot rolls over for this Friday’s drawing.</p>
<p>For just the fifth time in the 20-year history of Mega Millions, the jackpot has soared past $600 million,” a Mega Millions statement explained. While Mega Millions debuted in 2002, the game’s origins trace back to 1996 when it was known as the “Big Game.”</p>
<p>The Mega Millions jackpot continues its four-month roll when six numbers will be drawn at 11 pm ET this Friday.</p>
<p>Winners Galore</p>
<p>Though no Mega Millions player has won the jackpot since mid-April, the lottery game has delivered life-changing wins throughout the four-month run. The lottery says more than 17.9 million tickets have won some sort of prize.</p>
<p>However, most of the wins have been the minimal $2 win that simply returns the player’s bet.</p>
<p>There have been noteworthy wins, too. Of the 17.9 million winners, 29 tickets claimed a prize worth $1 million. Four of those $1 million winners were won last night.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s draw also saw 52 tickets match four white balls and the gold Mega Ball for the game’s third-best prize of $10,000. Eleven of those tickets purchased the $1 add-on Megaplier option to take their wins to $30,000 each after the Megaplier last night was 3x.</p>
<p>Mega Millions has sold just four tickets in 2022 that have matched all six numbers. The jackpots came in January and March, and two in April.</p>
<p>Mega Millions officials hope the ever-growing jackpot doesn’t result in jackpot fatigue. The lottery’s release says July has been a lucky month for players in the past, as two of the game’s top 10 jackpot wins have occurred this month. Those wins came in July 2016 ($536 million) and July 2018 ($543 million).</p>
<p>Approaching Halfway Point</p>
<p>At $630 million, the Mega Millions jackpot has a way to go to reach the top and become the largest Mega Millions prize ever. The game’s all-time jackpot record was set in 2018 when a single ticket sold in South Carolina claimed a $1.537 billion prize.</p>
<p>The 2018 Mega Millions jackpot represents the largest lottery win ever claimed by a single person in US history. South Carolina is one of only eight states that allow Mega Millions jackpot winners to remain anonymous, which the lucky winner took advantage of.</p>
