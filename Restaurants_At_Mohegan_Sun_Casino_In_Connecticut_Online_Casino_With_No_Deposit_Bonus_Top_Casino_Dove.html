<p>The provider of innovative and engaging content for the iGaming industry, 7777 gaming, confirmed its plans for further expansion to new markets and customers. Only recently, ICE London, one of the most-anticipated events within the gambling and entertainment vertical, wrapped up. In light of this, 7777 gaming confirmed it was noticed by many leading iGaming operators from different markets around the globe.</p>
<p>As a result, the company vowed to continue its expansion to new markets and to join forces with new platforms and operators. In a statement released on February 16, 2023, 7777 gaming acknowledged that its content is already live within strategic markets in Latin America and Europe. However, thanks to ICE London, the company confirmed it expanded its reach to Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>During ICE London, 7777 gaming granted its existing clients as well as new partners the option to benefit from bonus discounts via its Hit the Deal promo wheel. The lucrative wheel awarded more than â‚¬100,000 in various bonuses to different operators, helping attract new business-to-business (B2B) partners for the company.</p>
<p>Moreover, during ICE London, 7777 gaming highlighted four of its new titles that offer unique and engaging experiences. Those are Pearl of Egypt, Crystal Palace, Zeus and Mr. Luck. "The new casino concepts attracted many visitors to the company's stand, in a very attended ICE London," explained the company.</p>
<p>Elena Shaterova, 7777 gaming's CCO, commented on the topic saying: "The team and I are extremely proud of the fact that most of our visitors at ICE London already knew our brand and described it as alternative, innovative, and modern, with no equivalent in the iGaming industry in terms of the online casino games."</p>
<p>According to her, the time has come for the company to expand further through new partnerships that will benefit not only 7777 gaming but the operators as well. "During the three exhibition days, many new agreements were signed, while 7777 gaming is already live or in ongoing integrations with some of the leading casino games aggregators and platform providers worldwide via which operators can access the company's diverse portfolio of casino games," explained the company.</p>
<p>The expansion plan of the leading provider of content comes as no surprise, considering it has been continuously joining forces with new operators and boosting the reach of its products. In fact, only recently, 7777 gaming inked a partnership with Infingame, a globally-recognized aggregator within the online gambling vertical.</p>
<p>Before that, last month, the company teamed up with the Bulgarian operator Sesame. Thanks to such deals, 7777 gaming continues to expand the reach of its growing and popular portfolio to new customers.</p>
