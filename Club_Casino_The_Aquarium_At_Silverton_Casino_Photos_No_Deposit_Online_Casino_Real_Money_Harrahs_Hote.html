    <h1>Club Casino The Aquarium At Silverton Casino Photos No Deposit Online Casino Real Money Harrahs Hote</h1>

<p>Dear Tannin,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about the issue and understand your frustration. Do I understand correctly that you have been accused of breaching the maximum bet rule while completing bonus wagering?</p>
<p>I carefully checked the Bonus Terms on the website, and this is what I found https://www.roocasino369.com/en/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>„Players are allowed to place single bets lower than 20% of the total value of the Active Bonus credited and should not exceed 8 EUR, 8 USD, 8 AUD, 8 CAD, 8 NZD, 80 SEK, 80 NOK (as applicable). Therefore, placing a bet of 8 EUR while there's an Active Bonus of 100 EUR in effect is considered acceptable practice. VIP players are allowed to place single bets lower than 30% of the total value of the Active Bonus credited and should not exceed 15 EUR, 15 USD, 15 AUD, 15 CAD, 15 NZD, 150 SEK, 150 NOK (as applicable). Please note that your VIP level is defined by the casino's own discretion."</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing higher than allowed bets, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet. You were not stopped or blocked when you decided to increase your bet, and, as a result, you breached the maximum bet rule.</p>
<p>If you are aware of placing higher bets then the allowed ones, sadly, there is not much we can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to forward your game history along with any relevant communication to petronela.k@casino.guru if you feel that you’ve been accused mistakenly, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
