    <h1>Draftkings Online Casino Mark Twain Casino Riversweeps 777 Online Casino Login Meadowlands Casino Fr</h1>

<p>NASDAQ-traded Las Vegas-based corporation offering iGaming products Scientific Games Corporation has signed a deal with Rush Street Interactive (RSI), an American developer of market-proven land, online, and social gaming products for regulated markets in North and South America. The partnership will take Scientific Games’ content live with the help of a top-tier operator brand in Colombia, RushBet.co. Last November, Scientific Games made a strategic move and acquired Authentic Gaming as a means of penetrating the Live Casino market.</p>
<p>The New Deal, One Step Forward for Scientific Games</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be the first time Rush Street Interactive and Scientific Games would be working together. In 2021, RSI signed a deal with Scientific Games to premiere its online casino games in West Virginia via the BetRivers.com platform. One year before that, RSI started collaborating with Scientific Games, becoming the pioneering operator of online casinos in Pennsylvania to go live with highly popular games via the BetRivers.com and PlaySugarHouse.com platforms.</p>
<p>The new partnership targeting the Colombian iGaming market has already enabled a plethora of popular games from third parties as well as in-house releases to reach RSI’s fervent Colombian players via the OpenGaming platform. The first selection of games that will officially reach the market will include big names like Bonanza Megaways by Big Time Gaming, Lightning Box’s Dragon Palace, or Raging Rhino by SG Digital.</p>
<p>The collaboration between the two companies is another significant milestone that Scientific Games has reached in its endeavor to turn into the number one content aggregator in the area. Scientific Games is an important presence in other parts of the world as well. In February, the company launched a sports betting and lottery offer with the Azerbaijan National Lottery.</p>
<p>A further range of engaging games is set to receive certification for RushBet.co to offer its players in Colombia over the coming months as part of the multi-year agreement. Scientific Games (SG) will also provide exclusive content to RushBet.co, including a series of exciting digital conversions of the Company’s land-based hits.</p>
<p>Scientific Games’ commercial director Tatiana García Barrenechea expressed the company’s delight regarding the new partnership with RSI, which they consider a highly reputable and market-proven operator for top casinos online in both Latin America and the US. Scientific Games is expecting the games inspired by brick-and-mortar releases titles and the rest of the fresh content that will reach players at RushBet.co with the help of OpenGaming will bring excellent results for both companies.</p>
<p>RSI, Proud and Eager to Harness Scientific Games’ Stellar Content</p>
<p>Awarded with the Mobile Operator of the Year title for North America in 2019 at the EGR North America Awards, as well as the prestigious Casino Operator of the Year and American Operator of the Year awards during the American Gambling Awards ceremony in 2019, RSI also showed its eagerness to be bringing Scientific Games’ top-tier land casino content to its players. Using the voice of its General Manager for Colombia Omar Calvo, the company considers Scientific Games’ content “synonymous with quality and popularity”.</p>
<p>With even more spectacular titles waiting to be officially certified and launched on RushBet.co in the upcoming months and the much-anticipated exclusive content that Scientific Games will provide to RSI, the partnership between the two companies is looking bright. As further proof, Scientific Games’ NASDAQ shares went up 3.19%, reaching $64.13 per share the day the Colombian deal was signed.</p>
