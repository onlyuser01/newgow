<p>Swedish regulator Spelinspektionen has ordered Skill On Net to improve its KYC processes preventing non-residents to register for iGaming and betting in Sweden.</p>
<p>Skill On Net To Submit Report by March 1, 2021</p>
<p>The Swedish Gambling Authority, Spelinspektionen, has ordered iGaming operator Skill On Net has to improve its know your customer (KYC) processes to prevent non-residents to register for online gaming.</p>
<p>The Swedish regulator has announced it has found flaws in Skill On Net’s methods to assess permanent residency, which is necessary for anyone who wants to play online in the country. The operator must submit a report by March 1, 2021, outlining how it will ensure that non-residents do not register for games. Swedish gaming has been regulated under the Gaming Act since the beginning of 2019 and states that only residents and permanent residents of the country are authorized for online gaming registration.</p>
<p>Spelinspektionen has had an eye on the PlayOJO owner since April of this year, when it began supervising its compliance with the Gaming Act’s rules. The regulator carried regular checks on the group’s approach to player registration, identification methods, gaming accounts, in addition to checking customers against Sweden’s self-exclusion register. Issues were founds within manual KYC operations, and regulators addressed concerns over the situation of players registered before the gaming market’s regulation in January last year.</p>
<p>SEK14 Million Fine for Regulation Violations</p>
<p>Last week, the Administrative Court in Linköping rejected Skill On Net’s appeal on the SEK14 million fine it received in June concerning illegal bonuses and lotteries. According to Spelinspektionen regulations, gaming operators cannot offer more than one bonus per player upon registering on their platforms. Skill On Net and Betsson subsidiary NGG Nordic violated regulations last summer by offering bonuses repeatedly, through free spins or free games.</p>
<p>However, NGG Nordic’s fine was reduced from an initial SEK19 million to SEK14 million. The company had been operating lottery games, which were not covered in its online gaming and betting license.</p>
<p>Multiple Content Deals</p>
<p>Skill On Net operates dozens of brands, including popular online casinos PlayOJO and DrückGlück, and signed a deal with Booming Games at the beginning of December to add innovative blockbuster games, including VIP Filthy Riches, Freezing Classics, Booming Seven Deluxe, and Gold Vein, to its large portfolio.</p>
<p>Another deal with Authentic Gaming was also signed this month, providing Skill On Net’s users with the developer’s games across over 60 platforms. The Malta-licensed operator and Green Jade Games announced an agreement in November, which added arcade skill games to Skill On Net’s portfolio for the first time.</p>
