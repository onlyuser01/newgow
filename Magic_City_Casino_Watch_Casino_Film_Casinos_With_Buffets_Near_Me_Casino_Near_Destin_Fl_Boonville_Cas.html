Additionally, the collaboration will enable MaximBet to access White Hat’s proprietary technology such as first-to-market traveling wallet and in-house cashier. Undoubtedly, combining market-leading casino content with Kambi’s sportsbook solution will help MaximBet quickly grow while following the highest regulatory standards.</p>
<p>The Company Remains Focused on Providing the Best User Experience</p>
<p>MaximBet’s CEO, Daniel Graetzer, outlined that upon launching last year, the company vowed to bring the best online and in-person experience for its users around the world. According to him, the recent partnership with Kambi and White Hat Gaming helps fulfill that promise.</p>
<p>“When we launched MaximBet late last year, we promised our users the very best experience, both online and in the real world.” Daniel Graetzer, CEO at MaximBet</p>
<p>Additionally, Greatzer predicted that the collaboration will expand the real-life experiences for sports fans which will help separate the company from the traditional sportsbooks. In conclusion, he explained that the best events, prizes and experiences are the ones that will come soon.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming and Kambi Are Excited about the New Partnership</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming’s CEO, Phil Gelvan, commented on the subject by saying that the company selects only partners that share its “vision of delivering a best-in-class gaming experience for its users.” According to him, this makes MaximBet the perfect fit. In conclusion, Gelvan said that its technology and PAM solution will undoubtedly help MaximBet expand while offering a best-in-class product.</p>
<p>“Outsourcing core technology like the platform and PAM solution will enable MaximBet to focus on its expansion, player acquisition and retention whilst guaranteeing a best-in-class product.” Phil Gelvan, CEO at White Hat Gaming</p>
<p>Kambi’s CEO, Kristian Nylén, added that the company is delighted to join forces with MaximBet.
