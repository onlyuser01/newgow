As a result, gamblers can experience Konami’s Ba Fang Jin Bao, Aristocrat’s leading Might Cash Double Up and Light &amp; Wonder’s popular games Dancing Drums Explosion and 88 Fortunes Money Coins.</p>
<p>“In my 15 years working at Empire City, I can’t remember a time where we’ve had so many new games hit the gaming floor over a relatively short time period. MGM Resorts continues to make the necessary investments to ensure a top-tier experience for our guests.“ Ryan Munroe, executive director of slot operations for Empire City Casino</p>
<p>Ryan Munroe, Empire City Casino’s executive director of slot operations, outlined that the venue’s gaming floor undoubtedly looks different. He explained that after more than a decade with Empire City, he hasn’t seen that many new games delivered in such a short time. At the same time, Munroe said that MGM Resorts remains focused on providing unique experiences for its visitors by completing investments in its locations.</p>

<p>According to Munroe, visitors of the Empire City Casino have a shot at winning big prizes. He explained that the venue offers some of the highest payouts which confirms that money played by the customers is returned as prize money for lucky guests.</p>
<p>“Empire City also has some of the highest payouts in the industry, which means that more of the money played at Empire City is returned as payouts to our guests,“ added Munroe</p>
<p>Moreover, Munroe said that currently, Empire City Casino offers multiple progressive jackpots that are six figures each. The top three jackpots with the highest payouts at the venue are Bally’s Celestial King which is getting closer to $600,000, Bally’s Monopoly Millionaire jackpot which surpassed $500,000, as well as IGT’s Wheel of Fortune Triple Stars jackpot that is currently close to $500,000.</p>
