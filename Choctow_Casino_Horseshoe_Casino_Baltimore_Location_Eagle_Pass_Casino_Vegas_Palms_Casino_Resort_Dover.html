<p>The Los Angeles Lakers are desperate to end their 0-9 losing streak against the Phoenix Suns. They’ll have a chance to do so this evening (Wednesday, March 22) at Crypto.com Arena</p>
<p>The Suns seem to be the Lakers’ kryptonite, winning each of their last nine NBA meetings. This time, however, oddsmakers believe the boys from LA are more likely to win. It’s because they’re hungry for wins, which they need to book a place in the playoffs. But so are the Suns, who need wins to secure their spot in the postseason.</p>

<p>Phoenix Suns Hoping to Fix Their Form</p>
<p>The Suns are fourth in the Western Conference right now, with a 38-33 (.535) record. However, they still haven’t secured their spot in the postseason. Is this something they should be concerned about? They should because their recent form is abysmal – they’re 1-4 in their last five.</p>

<p>Losing four games in the space of one week is something that hasn’t happened to them since January. So, what’s the explanation for this? It’s that their schedule has been very tough lately. The teams they lost to are the Sacramento Kings, Golden State Warriors, Milwaukee Bucks, and Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
<p>Losing to those teams isn’t something to be embarrassed about, especially because some of the Suns’ players did very well in those games. Devin Booker, for instance, scored 46 points in his most recent game.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Lakers Praying for a Win</p>
<p>The Lakers are 35-37 (.486) and with just 10 games left before the end of the 2022-23 regular season, they need to step up. They need to win as many games as possible in order to book a place in the postseason.</p>
<p>"LeBron [James] is not close to returning from what I'm told… I know that LeBron has played through injuries in the past. I'm not 100% sure if this is an injury you can play through."</p>

<p>The good news is that they’re not far from the playoff zone. The bad news is that their recent form isn’t impressive. They’re 2-3 in their last five games, and one of the main reasons for that is that their superstar LeBron James is out with a foot injury.</p>
<p>In his absence, Anthony Davis was supposed to be the man in charge of scoring. However, their second-best scorer hasn’t been much efficient lately. Davis has a season average of 25.8 PPG, but we saw him score under that number in three of his last five games.</p>
<p>Phoenix Suns vs Los Angeles Lakers Prediction</p>
<p>The Lakers have the motivation on their side, but the problem is that they’re just not as good as the Suns, especially not with LeBron James out of action. The visitors from Phoenix have the manpower to beat them for the 10th time in a row.</p>
<p>Pick: Phoenix Suns to win and cover the spread</p>
