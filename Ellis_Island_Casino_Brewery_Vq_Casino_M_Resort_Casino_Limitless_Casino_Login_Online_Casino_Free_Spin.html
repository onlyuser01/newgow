<p>Rogers has an impressive track record and will be a valuable asset to the company</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment, a provider of gambling content and solutions, has unveiled the appointment of Ian Freeman as its new chief commercial officer. Starting on November 16, the new hire will be responsible for expanding the presence of the company’s virtual sports products.</p>
<p>As CCO of the company, Freeman is set to replace Steve Rogers. The latter is a long-time Inspired employee who has been with the company for more than 25 years. Rogers is now set to explore other opportunities.</p>
<p>Freeman, on the other hand, is an experienced executive with years of experience in the gambling industry. Prior to his new position, he served FSBTech as chief revenue officer for approximately three years. Earlier still, he served as the VP of global business development and commercial at IGT’s PlayDigital division.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Freeman had a stint as EveryMatrix’s chief commercial officer, following a five-year tenure in the same position at Kambi. In the latter case, Freeman played a role in the group’s initial public offering.</p>
<p>Freeman’s earlier career includes roles at a variety of other companies.</p>
<p>Freeman Will Be a Valuable Asset to Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Freeman’s impressive track record made him a perfect fit for Inspired Entertainment. According to the company’s president and chief executive officer, Brooks Pierce, the new hire’s background in sports betting would be invaluable to the team.</p>
<p>Pierce praised the appointment, saying that Freeman’s expertise in commercial, operational and technical areas will help Inspired Entertainment take its virtual sports business “to the next level.” The president emphasized the importance of Virtual Sports, further highlighting the value of this new appointment.</p>
<p>Virtual Sports is a key driver of the growth strategy of Inspired and we are excited to add Ian to this key leadership role. Brooks Pierce, president &amp; CEO, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Pierce used the opportunity to also speak on Steve Rogers’ departure from the company. The president thanked the outgoing CCO for his incredible contributions, hailing him as a crucial part of the company’s continued success. Pierce concluded that the Inspired Entertainment team wishes Rogers all the best in his future endeavors.</p>
<p>In other news, Inspired Entertainment just signed a monumental deal with the National Basketball Association, allowing it to launch an NBA-inspired Virtual Sports game. The new product will be based on archived NBA footage and will allow fans to wager on fast-paced matchups.</p>
