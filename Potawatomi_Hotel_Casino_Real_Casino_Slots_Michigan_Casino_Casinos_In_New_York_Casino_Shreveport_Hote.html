<p>BGC has announced that UK casinos can reopen as of July 4. Enhanced sanitation and social distancing protocols will be applicable for all venues.</p>
<p>Casinos in UK to Reopen as of July 4</p>
<p>UK’s Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) has announced that the casinos in the country can reopen as of July 4. Initial plans indicated that sports betting and other non-essential business was planned to open in time for the Royal Ascot, but the most recent update pushed the date. The non-essential businesses including casinos were ordered to shut down back in March. This was one of the many methods that the government used in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country.</p>
<p>Now, nearly three months later, the UK casinos are patiently waiting to reopen doors. As it turns out, operators will have to stay on hold for a little longer before resuming business. The date July 4 was chosen by the government as it is in line with the Stage 3 of relaxing of the measures across the country. With reopening planned for that date, each venue will have to follow sanitation and social distancing protocols.</p>
<p>Here is what BGC chief executive, Michael Dugher had to say on the subject: “Nothing is more important to the casino sector than the safety of staff and customers. I know that the casino operators have been working tirelessly to ensure that when they do reopen for business again, every possible measure will be in place to ensure the health and safety of everyone who enters the premises.” Furthermore, BGC outlined that the casino operators in the UK are prepared to implement strict measures. By doing so, the operators will ensure the health and safety of both guests and employees.</p>
<p>The Post-COVID-19 Casino Atmosphere</p>
<p>But how would the UK casinos look like in the post-coronavirus (COVID-19) world? For starters, punters will be entering the casino one by one. The overall capacity of each venue will also be restricted in a way that social distancing is applied and there is enough space between each player. Hand sanitizers will be used when entering the venue, leaving a game or joining a game. The gaming equipment will be cleaned after each session and ATMs will be sanitized at regular intervals. Furthermore, personal protective equipment will be provided for the staff.</p>
<p>In addition, each casino will have to draw a layout which eases the social distancing between the staff and guests. Screens made of plexiglas will also be installed where possible. This will ensure both the casino staff and visitor’s safety. Employees will also undergo training that ensures safe casino operations with the help of proper social distancing.</p>
<p>According to BGC’s recent statement, some high-class casinos may choose not to restart business as of July 4. This is because a big part of the clients that visit high-end venues are usually coming from overseas. If those operators restart business before the travelling is resumed to normal, they are risking for their venues to remain uninhabited.</p>
<p>In conclusion, BGC stressed out the importance of the casino operators role in the UK. Besides the taxation and employment, the operators contribute by supporting hospitality, entertainment and tourism.</p>
