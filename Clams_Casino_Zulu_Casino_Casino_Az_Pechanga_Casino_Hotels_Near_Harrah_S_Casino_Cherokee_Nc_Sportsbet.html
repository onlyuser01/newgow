<p>Flutter Entertainment’s flagship sports gambling brand in Australia, Sportsbet, announced a new campaign last week designed to champion responsible gambling in the country and address the issue head-on.</p>
<p>Sportsbet Vows to Raise Safer Gambling Standards</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment’s brand Sportsbet has vowed to do more in order to safeguard customers from harmful gambling practices. Holding a leadership position in the online sports betting market in Australia, the company has launched the “take a sec before you bet” campaign, which is designed to encourage customers to be more cautious about the way they participate and interact with gambling products.</p>
<p>Sportsbet pulls significant clout in the Australian sports betting market and is now determined to encourage a broader review of responsible gambling practices in the market by urging consumers to consider setting deposit limits across their online betting accounts registered at Sportsbet and beyond.</p>
<p>The brand is keen on broaching a broader discussion about how to best safeguard sports gamblers in Australia against the dangers of excessive gambling that can translate into gambling harm. This comes on time for the upcoming NFL, NBA, and college sports seasons which are already followed closely by mytopsportsbooks.com as arguably the biggest sports betting events on the calendar.</p>
<p>To address excessive gambling, though, Sportsbet will spare no effort and push for a broader awareness about the issue. As a result, the sportsbook will advertise the “take a sec before you bet” campaign on multiple channels, including but not limited to TV, radio, media outlets, outdoor billboards, broadcast integrations, and various video assets.</p>
<p>Responsible Gaming Is a Global Mission for Gambling Companies</p>
<p>This reflects on a bigger strategy undertaken by Flutter Entertainment to promote safer gambling and follows a trend where gambling operators and companies take the lead in establishing a safer gambling environment for everyone.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, DraftKings and the American Gaming Association (AGA) launched the “Have A Game Plan” initiative to address the issue as sports gambling in the United States is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>BetMGM, one of Flutter and DraftKings’ main rivals in the US sports gambling market, has launched GameSense, a platform designed to improve responsible gambling. AGA has followed through with responsible gambling by most recently pushing for clearer disclaimers that better inform gamblers about the risks the activity carries.</p>
<p>Sportsbet CEO Barni Evans reaffirmed the company’s role in promoting safer gambling and responsibility to consumers no matter who they bet with. Sportsbet remains committed to driving home the underlying message that is that consumers ought to keep their betting in check regardless of what aspect of the experience they are exploring.</p>
