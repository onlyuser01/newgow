<p>Inspire opened its resort on November 30. The $1.6 billion resort — the first phase of a multi-development project that will take the Mohegan tribe’s total investment to $5 billion in the coming years — commenced operations with three hotels featuring 1,275 guest rooms and 10 restaurants.</p>
<p>The resort has an “immersive entertainment street,” where guests walk through a tunnel with LED lights and displays adjourning the 500-foot-long walkway. Inspire additionally features a multipurpose arena with a capacity for 15K people, convention facilities, and a grand ballroom.</p>
<p>Mohegan, the commercial gaming unit of the Mohegan Tribe in Connecticut, is primarily in the gaming business. It is making its largest financial bet outside the U.S. through South Korea, based on the belief that the foreigner-only casino will attract high rollers from throughout Asia.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the epitome of entertainment at Inspire, the largest foreigner-only casino in Korea,” the resort’s website reads. “Boasting state-of-the-art facilities, we offer an unparalleled gaming experience. Surrounded by captivating images and dynamic digital displays, Inspire Casino has meticulously crafted an environment that transcends conventional gaming. Step into a world where entertainment takes center stage, delivering a comprehensive and immersive experience like no other.”</p>
<p>However, the casino at Inspire hasn’t yet opened, as Mohegan needed final regulatory signoffs from South Korea’s National Gambling Control Commission. The gaming regulator had been performing its final testing of the Inspire Casino gaming machines and table games before giving its final blessing.</p>
<p>Opening Date Announced</p>
<p>Mohegan initially planned to announce the opening of the Inspire Casino on Monday. The company delayed the announcement to Wednesday. But then Wednesday came and went.</p>
<p>Mohegan Inspire President Chen Si finally revealed the casino opening on Thursday. Chen said the Inspire Casino will welcome its first players this Saturday, February 3, at precisely 8:08 a.m. local time. The number eight is considered lucky in many Asian cultures, including Korea.</p>
<p>Casino Details</p>
<p>In newly provided details to Casino.org, Mohegan clarified the scope of the casino space.</p>
<p>The resort casino will span about 200K square feet and occupy two levels. The Main Casino is on Level 2 of the resort and will be for the general gaming public.</p>
<p>Calling the main casino a “lively and exciting realm” with “diverse gaming experiences” for “guests from all walks of life,” the Inspire Casino space will be where the primary allotment of slots sit. In all, the Level 2 casino will offer just 374 slots and 50 different games. By comparison, Mohegan’s namesake flagship casino resort in Connecticut, Mohegan Sun, offers nearly 4,000 slots.</p>
<p>Inspire will also offer a 160-seat electronic table game stadium featuring a 78-foot LED screen. As for live dealer table games, the resort will open with 150 tables from 13 titles. Baccarat will be the dominant game.</p>
<p>Inspire will also operate a VIP Casino space on Level 3. The intimate gaming experience in private rooms, Mohegan officials say, is reserved for those seeking “a refined and elegant ambiance.”</p>
