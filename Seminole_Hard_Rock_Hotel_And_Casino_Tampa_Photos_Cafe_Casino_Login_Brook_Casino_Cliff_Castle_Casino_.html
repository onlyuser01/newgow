<p>The Unibet sports betting brand has long been popular for the premium ice hockey wagering experiences it offers to customers</p>
<p>Kindred Group has announced that its Unibet brand has been selected as the official partner of the National Hockey League (NHL) in Sweden. The deal will be celebrated with a variety of activations and exclusive NHL-themed content.</p>
<p>Thanks to this arrangement, Unibet, which is the first Swedish betting company, will be able to engage fans of professional hockey with a plethora of NHL-themed dynamic marketing campaigns across its digital channels.</p>
<p>Kindred’s flagship brand already offers a strong suite of hockey-oriented betting offerings, which will now be further enhanced with the introduction of the aforementioned NHL campaigns. This way Unibet will be able to provide customers with a “more authentic experience,” Kindred believes.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the partnership will be supported by Sportradar, a sports data specialist that serves as the NHL’s official betting data rights partner. The provider’s ad:s solution powers the NHL with data-driven marketing, helping it grow its online presence and find sports betting partners outside of North America.</p>
<p>Unibet Remains Committed to the North American Hockey Scene</p>
<p>John Lewicki, the vice president of business development and partnerships at the NHL, shared his thoughts on the new deal. He said that the league is thrilled to welcome Unibet as its official partner in Sweden and grow its presence in the Nordic country.</p>
<p>Lewicki praised Unibet for its exceptional commitment to responsible gambling and said that he is looking forward to working with Unibet.</p>
<p>We welcome this opportunity to work with Unibet to continue to engage our robust and expanding hockey fanbase in Sweden. John Lewicki, VP business development and partnerships, NHL</p>
<p>Philip Lagström, the country manager of Unibet Sweden, also shared his sentiments, saying that he feels honored that Unibet is the first Swedish company to become an official partner of the NHL. Lagström added that he hopes to increase interest in ice hockey and the North American sports scene as a whole because there will be many exciting developments to follow in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>Ice hockey and NHL is very important for Unibet, and we have for a long time wanted to get more involved to cement the position as the customers’ first choice when they want to bet on ice hockey by offering the absolute best, safest and most secure gaming experience. Philip Lagström, country manager of Unibet Sweden, Kindred Group</p>
<p>In other news, Kindred Group just released an update on its Journey Toward Zero program. Currently, only 3.3% of the company’s revenues come from problem gamblers – a number the betting specialist hopes to bring down to zero.</p>
