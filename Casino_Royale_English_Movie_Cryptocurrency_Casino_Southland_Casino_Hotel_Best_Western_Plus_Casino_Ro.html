    <h1>Casino Royale English Movie Cryptocurrency Casino Southland Casino Hotel Best Western Plus Casino Ro</h1>

<p>PGA Tour and the Score Media and Gaming announced today an agreement to designate theScore Bet as an Official Betting Operator in the US and Canada for the organizer of professional golf tournaments.</p>
<p>Canada’s First Betting Operator</p>
<p>Under the new partnership, theScore Bet is also set to become the PGA Tour’s 1st Official Betting Operator in Canada as soon as appropriate legislation is passed and pending subsequent regulation and licensing. In the US, theScore Bet becomes the 5th Official Betting Operator of the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>“The PGA TOUR has been an innovative, industry leader in sports betting and we’re excited to collaborate to enhance our integrated media and betting experience.” Aubrey Levy, SVP, Marketing and Content, theScore</p>
<p>According to the agreement, daily odds updates supplied by theScore Bet will be incorporated within the live audio play-by-play of the PGA Tour, aired via SiriumXM PGA Tour Radio, and distributed across PGA Tour Digital platforms.</p>
<p>“The PGA TOUR is focused on engaging sports fans and Score Media and Gaming is one of the global leaders in delivering highly personalized scores, news, statistics and sports betting information. Leveraging theScore’s vast reach via this relationship will allow the TOUR to engage fans in unique and creative ways.” Scott Warfield, VP, Gaming, PGA Tour</p>
<p>Advertising and Distribution Rights</p>
<p>The PGA Tour and its media partners will grant rights to theScore Bet to advertise and distribute video content under the new partnership with the Tour, to allow the sports betting brand to enhance its golf product offering and coverage on theScore and theScore Bet apps.</p>
<p>“The PGA TOUR is a proponent of leveraging media to create unique betting experiences and shares our view for the sizable potential of a regulated Canadian market. We’re proud to partner with the TOUR as an Official Betting Operator immediately across the U.S., and in Canada as soon as legislation allows.” Aubrey Levy, SVP, Marketing and Content, theScore</p>
<p>The deal with theScore Bet is the latest in a series of sports betting initiatives for the PGA Tour, among which stand out the integrity program in collaboration with Genius Sports and the global partnership deal with IMG ARENA to allow the distribution of official live scoring data to sportsbook operators across the globe.</p>
<p>The Official Betting Operator category of the PGA Tour was launched by the organizer of professional golf tournaments last year, while the organization’s GolfBet partnership with The Action Network continues to evolve.</p>
<p>The PGA Tour is also a platinum member of the National Council on Problem Gambling and participant of the ‘Have A Game Plan Bet Responsibly’ public service campaign of the American Gaming Association.</p>
