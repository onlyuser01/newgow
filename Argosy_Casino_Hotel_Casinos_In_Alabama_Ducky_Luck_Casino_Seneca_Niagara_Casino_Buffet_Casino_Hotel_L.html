<p>Caesars will launch DGC iGaming content in New Jersey, with launches in Pennsylvania and Michigan to follow at a later date.</p>
<p>Digital Gaming Corporation (DGC), a provider of premium online gaming solutions, has unveiled a new agreement with the North American iGaming giant Caesars Digital. Under the agreement, the former company will supply the operator with its “exceptional portfolio of superior online casino games.”</p>
<p>Caesars Digital will integrate the content into its Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino brand and will first launch it in New Jersey. The operator will also roll out the content to its customers in Pennsylvania and Michigan starting in Q3, 2023.</p>
<p>The new integration will arm Caesars with some of DGC’s best titles. As a result, iGaming players will get to play engaging slots such as Gold Blitz and Squealin Riches, two fan favorites that are taking the market by storm. In addition, Caesars will also onboard famous titles such as Assassin Moon, Blazing Mammoth and Thunderstruck Wild Lightning.</p>
<p>DGC’s B2B iGaming division was founded in 2014. It leverages digital analytics paired with best-in-class technology to produce exceptional content for its clients and their players. As a result, DGC quickly cemented itself as a fast-growing provider of great online casino experiences.</p>
<p>The popularity of its titles is sure to benefit Caesars and help it channel more players toward its digital platform.</p>
<p>Caesars Is Looking Forward to Bringing the Same Content to More States</p>
<p>The chief commercial director of DGC’s B2B iGaming Division, Neill Whyte, commented on the agreement, praising Caesars as a leader in contemporary gaming. He said that DGC is glad to join forces with such a respected operator and added that he is excited to see how the players will react to the new games.</p>
<p>Our games have consistently proved popular in the United States because we make sure we’re delivering the kind of content that players in that region want and we’re eager to show Caesars customers all our top-quality content. Neill Whyte, CCO, DGC B2B iGaming Division</p>
<p>Matt Sunderland, Caesars Digital’s senior vice president of iGaming, also shared his thoughts. He praised DGC’s impressive lineup of titles and said that it will be a great addition to Caesars’ offering.</p>
<p>We’re excited to launch these titles on Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino in New Jersey and look forward to bringing them to customers in even more states. Matt Sunderland, SVP of iGaming, Caesars Digital</p>
<p>The current agreement with DGC echoes a recent deal between Caesars Digital and Evolution. A few days ago, the online casino operator onboarded slots and live casino games from the latter company, further bolstering its presence in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>At the beginning of May, Caesars also added content from High 5 Games to its PA library.</p>
