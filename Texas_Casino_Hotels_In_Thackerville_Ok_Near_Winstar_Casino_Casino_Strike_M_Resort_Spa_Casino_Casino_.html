    <h1>Texas Casino Hotels In Thackerville Ok Near Winstar Casino Casino Strike M Resort Spa Casino Casino</h1>

<p>First of all, it took hours and attempts until they even verified me. Simply arbitrarily and repeatedly demanding documents even though I had already uploaded them!</p>
<p>Then it said you are now verified and the money is on its way to be processed only to be canceled again.</p>
<p>now I should change the BIC again, which is probably wrong, which is not true!</p>
<p>So, now I entered the BIC in letter form and requested a payout again and I was assured by customer support that it should work now...</p>
<p>I remain curious, because this has already been announced to me as incorrect and if the men or women would simply look at how I paid in and transfer it back, there would be no problems...</p>
<p>First of all thanks for your help</p>
<p>I am now awaiting further steps from the casino</p>
<p>Regards, Lars</p>
