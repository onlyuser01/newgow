    <h1>Hotels Cherokee Nc Near Casino Casino In Washington Dc Par A Dice Hotel And Casino South Lake Tahoe</h1>

<p>Alright, Gerardo, I understand.</p>
<p>What payment method did you use to withdraw your winnings?</p>
<p>As I can see in the screenshots provided by the casino representative, there are no payment method details at all. Moreover, there is a note that KYC has not been completed. Also, I see only the emails that you sent to the casino, but without any reply from the casino, where the ZIP code is missing.</p>
<p>How were you informed that your KYC has been completed, please?</p>
<p>If your verification had been completely done, you should have received an email with a confirmation. Could you please find such an email and send it to my email address (branislav.b@casino.guru)?</p>
<p>As for your VIP level - although you provided me with the email in which it is mentioned, the email is more than 3 years old, and it does not mean that your status is still active, especially, if you did not make a deposit for 4 years. In addition, it looks like only additional general information/notes for all players that the applied rules depend on the player's VIP level. Therefore, we consider the email irrelevant.</p>
<p>There is no confirmation of your VIP level or the completion of KYC or withdrawal. And, as I mentioned before, the provided emails only confirm you sent the documents to the casino, but there is no reply from the casino or any information about KYC completion. Thus, these emails are irrelevant too. There is no information about anything else except for the remaining balance of â‚¬0.71 and your personal details in the account.</p>
<p>You wrote that you earned the winnings from a no-deposit bonus. How many no-deposit bonuses did you use after your last deposit in 2018 and before you obtained the significant winnings from the last bonus? Did you make deposits in the past to play with your real money, or you made them only to be able to withdraw winnings from no-deposit bonuses (confirmation deposits)?</p>
<p>Also, there are still questions that have not been answered yet.</p>
<p>"Are you sure that you submitted your complaint here with the correct email address (ger<strong><em>*</em></strong>***17@gmail.com)? Did you have another account in the casino?</p>
<p>Can you please provide me with the communication where the casino informed you that your verification was completed? Can you also send me a confirmation about your VIP status?</p>
<p>Did you try to log in on https://parisvipcasinofrance.com/ using your credentials from the closed casino https://www.parisvipcasino.com/? If yes, did it work?"</p>
<p>Please note that your cooperation is necessary, and we need all the details I am asking for. In case you are not able or willing to cooperate and provide us with the requested details, I am not sure if we are able to further help you in resolving the issue. To be honest, for now, it looks like only your claims against the casino's claims, but with one difference - the casino was able to support its claims with evidence and data.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
