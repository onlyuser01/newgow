    <h1>Sunset Station Hotel Casino Arizona Casino Gambling Casinos Free Coins For Cashman Casino Games Casi</h1>

<p>ALERT PURE SCAM</p>
<p>BEWARE. DO NO PLAY .</p>
<p>UNABLE TO Withdraw. Based on only what they say.</p>
<p>While showing no proof .</p>
<p>" Irreversible ban,</p>
<p>....with confiscation of Cash Money (No Bonus),</p>
<p>....Plus, bad CS where they just close the chat when they are done "</p>
<p>I was as usual looking around guru and stumbled upon this website.</p>
<p>I clicked the bonus and tried registering which failed.</p>
<p>I then realized that my email has been registered before.</p>
<p>So I tried resetting my password and logged in .</p>
<p>I then asked for the No deposit bonus to try things out but apparently the CS said I have already used it.</p>
<p>So I thought it's ok. I'll just play a little to try things out.</p>
<p>I was also told to fill in my details etc.</p>
<p>Thereafter I deposited money in (WITHOUT TAKING ANY BONUS)</p>
<p>I was assured that my account and currency will have no problems 3 times because I was literally worried about problems and hassles like this.</p>
<p>I deposited and then played for the day.</p>
<p>Got some profit and figured I should try withdawing some to check how things go.</p>
<p>When I withdrawed.</p>
<p>It shows pending, but my balance is still the same.</p>
<p>Worried I may have did something wrong while withdrawing.</p>
<p>I asked the CS again to check.</p>
<p>The CS then told me normally it will take a day to do the withdawal and there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>I then went on with my things..</p>
<p>When I came back to chrome. I was logged out.</p>
<p>When I tried to log in. It suddenly shows that I am blocked.</p>
<p>I then asked the CS what's the problem .</p>
<p>He then told me I have abused their bonus.</p>
<p>Or I have "data" has been used.</p>
<p>I told them that I didn't take any bonus. And this is the first time playing, first time depositing, first time withdrawing.</p>
<p>My phone number is still the same.</p>
<p>Email the same.</p>
<p>Even my bank details was just filled in today .</p>
<p>So which data was used or which bonus was abused.</p>
<p>The CS explained that...</p>
<p>They can't show me proof.</p>
<p>The CS doesn't have my private data.</p>
<p>They can't even tell me which what who data or account is used.</p>
<p>They can't even tell me which bonus I abused when I didn't even take any bonus when depositing.</p>
<p>So how is it they say I'm abusing their bonus. When I didn't take it.</p>
<p>And then change it to my data is used.</p>
<p>Plus, if my data is used.</p>
<p>Aren't I suppose to be able to prove that this is me?</p>
<p>If someone else used my data, why would my money be blocked?</p>
<p>So when people play, they lose. Then no problem.</p>
<p>When they win, they abused the bonus? In which I didn't even accept any .</p>
