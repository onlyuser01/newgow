    <h1>Casino In Baltimore Casinos In Houston Texas No Deposit Free Spins Casinos Foxwoods Resort And Casin</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>About a month ago, I began playing at Kryptosino. While I have made some small winnings, my losses greatly outweigh them. I started using the responsible gambling tool and I contacted live support inquiring why, in my profile, it indicates that one can remove their deposit limit, yet I couldn't set one even though I wanted to. I was told by support that such a system doesn't exist. Consequently, I self-excluded myself for a few days. However, the live support explained to me that I could lift this at any time just by sending an email.</p>
<p>I found myself wondering why I could restrict myself for, say, 7 days, but then, merely 5 minutes later, I could write an email, answer whatever questions the support wants to hear because I'm addicted and want to gamble. The casino would write back within a maximum of 15-30 minutes, reinstating my access. I performed this self-exclusion process multiple times over several days, sometimes twice a day, only to have my account repeatedly reopened. It allowed me to keep losing more and more money to the extent that I vented my frustration by sending abusive emails to the support team. In my state, it should have been apparent to the casino at a very early stage that I was a gambling addict and should have had me permanently banned. Yet they did nothing, and I ended up losing thousands of Euros. Multiple times I told live chat support to ban me, but they insisted that only I could do so via my profile. Still, I did this multiple times over several days. Unfortunately, each time, my self-imposed bans were reversed via countless emails, enabling me to continue squandering my money.</p>
<p>I am hereby demanding a refund of my most recent deposits from this casino, on grounds that they in no way encourage responsible gambling. Despite having a restriction system, it is essentially useless for gambling addicts like myself.</p>
