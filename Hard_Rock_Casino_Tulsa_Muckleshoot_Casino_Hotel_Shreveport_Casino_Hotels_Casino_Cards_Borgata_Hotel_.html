<p>FanDuel is going to rev up its self-promotion efforts by teaming up with marketing automation platform provider Fresh8. Fresh8 will now bolster FanDuel’s positions in the United States.</p>
<p>FanDuel and Fresh8 Work on Marketing in the United States</p>
<p>Paddy Power Betfair’s subsidiary, FanDuel, has long been present on the US market. With the industry expanding and multiple players entering the fray, the company is now looking into ways to expand its clout in the sector.</p>
<p>As a result, FanDuel will be partnering with data-driven marketing-solutions company Fresh8. With FanDuel’s focus being primarily in New Jersey, it’s the exact starting point that Fresh8 will have.</p>
<p>The marketing agency will use B2B CRM data solutions to streamline the entire process in FanDuel’s marketing campaigns, not only looking to achieve a broader reach, but also slash on costs and time.</p>
<p>Off to a Good Start</p>
<p>FanDuel will kick up its marketing efforts by working with Fresh8 on the company’s video content advertising and reaching out to certain demographics in a bid to obtain new customers and retain them.</p>
<p>Fresh8 provides FanDuel affiliates with a very simple piece of code allowing partners to support and spread awareness about the sportsbooks’ operations. FanDuel is also working with IGT, which by default extends its offer to multiple other betting platforms across the United States, including Amelco, Kambi, SBTech, and SG Digital, multiple sources have confirmed.</p>
<p>Why the Automation?</p>
<p>According to Paddy Power Betfair, there’s little time for companies to allocate to building natural campaigns. To stay competitive, operators need to turn to a professional marketing agency that can automate the process without detracting from the value of the end product.</p>
<p>Here’s what Fresh8 CEO Andrew Sharland had to say on the occasion:</p>
<p>We are delighted FanDuel chose us to help them achieve advertising scale across channels as they expand state-by-state across the US including helping them activate their tier one media company relationships.</p>
<p>FanDuel has been developing well on the US market, keeping neck-and-neck with its main competitor DraftKings.</p>
<p>Daily fantasy sports (DFS) remains one of the most loved segments by bettors in the United States. FanDuel also attempted to offer DFS betting on competitive video gaming, but its first attempts were bogged down in a lot of legal opposition.</p>
<p>Today, FanDuel is back and it continues to generate good revenue in New Jersey. With the help of Fresh8, the company hopes to boost awareness and continue adding customers and revenue.</p>
