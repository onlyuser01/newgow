<p>Better Collective has published the Q3 interim report covering July 1 - September 30, 2023, reporting a 26% revenue increase to €75 million ($81.5 million)</p>
<p>The leading digital sports media group that owns national and international sports media, Better Collective, has published its interim report for Q3.

<p>Transition Into Recurring Revenue, “Faster Than Expected”</p>
<p>The group’s CEO also took the opportunity to express his pleasure in seeing that the transition into recurring revenue with their partners in North America was “moving faster than expected, which will provide strong value in the long run.”</p>
<p>The CEO further explained that, throughout Q3, the group kept growing globally by acquiring top national sports media across four different markets while also mentioning the “transformational” acquisition of Playmaker Capital toward the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to help the company speed up its journey toward turning into the leading digital sports media group even more, especially with the help of the team’s strong strategy execution.</p>
