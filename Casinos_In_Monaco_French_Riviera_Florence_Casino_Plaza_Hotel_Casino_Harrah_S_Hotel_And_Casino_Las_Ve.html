<p>Spotlight Sports Group is again making the headlines today after one of its assets, Racing Post, announced its interactive betting shop display has been transformed.</p>
<p>All Data and Content on One Screen</p>
<p>Racing Post is changing its betting shop display to offer a new and improved customer experience via a redeveloped and more intuitive interface based on studies with major high street retail shops. Retailers have been utilizing the print version of the display for years to present data and content from all UK, Ireland and international racing events.</p>
<p>“Racing Post content has covered walls of betting shops for over 25 years and we’re delighted to be evolving our offering to support the future of retail. Betting shop staff and customers know the value of having Racing Post content available every day and with the latest release, we’re delighted to expand that offering while making it even easier to access.” Alan Pepperell, B2B Retail Director, Spotlight Sports Group</p>
<p>Retailers stopped presenting the betting shop display on their walls, following the introduction of a new digital version of the display Racing Post developed in recent years. Now, the media dedicated to horse racing news and results transformed the display to bring all valuable data and content on one screen.</p>
<p>“On one screen you can now get information on global horseracing, greyhound and virtual racing while reading the day’s best insights from world-famous Racing Post tipsters. We are constantly performing research in our stores to improve the product and we’re excited to see customers interact with our brand new display.” Alan Pepperell, B2B Retail Director, Spotlight Sports Group</p>
<p>Filled with integrated proprietary data, content and tipping from racing events in the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Hong Kong, UAE, France and the US, the redesigned Racing Post’s betting shop display also features data and content from greyhound races across the UK and Ireland, as well as virtual racing.</p>
<p>Application as an Early Price Screen</p>
<p>Powered by state-of-the-art technology, Racing Post’s betting shop display also allows for early price integration into the product, offering customers the opportunity to use it as much as a traditional betting shop display, so as an early price screen. The latest upgrade added derived markets to increase betting opportunities and the display’s attractiveness to betting operators.</p>
<p>Racing Post transformed the betting shop display to include all data and content on one screen following recent research that found out the availability of results in-store was contributing to an 18% increase in the number of wagers placed in the retail shop. Following the latest upgrade, the betting shop display is now available for all shop sizes.</p>
