    <h1>The Strat Hotel Casino And Skypod Birmingham Casino How Many Casinos Are In Atlantic City Alabama Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Martin,</p>
<p>Once again,thank you for contacting us regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Not much we can add to this topic as you have already reached us via our support email.</p>
<p>You as a betting website and forum must know and understand and that also goes for our clients as well,that online sports betting and gambling industry is a very sensitive industry when it comes to some areas of business and that it calls for caution.</p>
<p>First of all,we do not recognize this unregistered user Stefan,this user should use his real name.</p>
<p>Proper documentation is definitely one of them,so is following verification procedures that are connected to our AML ( Anti Money Laundering) team and their policy and rules. We as a company are obliged to wait for a positive confirmation from their side that everything is in order with every single client of ours and with the documents that they provide.</p>
<p>When it comes to this client in particular, there were many suspicious alerts and behaviors that had to be taken into consideration when deciding what to do with his account.</p>
<p>One of those being multiple numerous IP Addresses used from different cities, which are more than two and a half hours of driving distance,but yet somehow this client managed to log into his account from these different addresses within only 40 minutes time,that is highly unlikely and immediately causes suspicion. We shall provide you with the screenshots of some of these logins and logouts. This is something that happened repeatedly in less than seven days. His IP addresses showed us that he was logging in from four different cities in Germany: Mönchengladbach, Dortmund, Düsseldorf and Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Second issue that caused extra attention and caution is with his deposit transactions and many problems that those caused us. To be specific,those deposits were made using Paypal,and while some of them were completely fine, some of them were causing us difficulties as those payments did not go through,meaning he was making the deposit, we were providing him with the credits on his account on our website, but yet the money did not show on our account balance and this made it seem like we were giving him free betting services and you must realize the severity of that issue.</p>
<p>All of these issues mentioned above took us a bit more time to go through everything and resolve the problem.</p>
<p>This client's account is now verified and he is capable of withdrawing his money.</p>
<p>We must add and say that have seen the complaint on your website and since this player was highly disrespectful towards us and had this threatening manner that he was going to contact you,and that is not the issue at all,we expect a bit more respect to be shown towards our company and we do not think that it is fair to make judgement based on this type of situations.</p>
<p>We are a company that treats its clients with high respect and we are always there to provide proper and quick answers.</p>
<p>We must add,this client is currently being paid his winnings and his account has been verified.</p>
<p>We will not be involved in any further discussion and we consider this issue to be resolved.</p>
<p>Also,from now on,we will not tolerate any offensive and foul language that has been used by this client towards our company name and its employees.</p>
<p>Finally, we are sorry for all of the inconvenience caused and also glad to see this whole situation resolved as we feel that there was no need for all of this,just a bit more patient from the mentioned client and this whole situation would have been resolved.</p>
<p>And of course, you can always contact us on our email address, for any reason.</p>
<p>Kind regards!</p>
