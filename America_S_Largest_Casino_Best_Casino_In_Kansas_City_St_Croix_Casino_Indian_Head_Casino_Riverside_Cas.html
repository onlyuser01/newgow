A comparison to the €33.0 million ($36 million) posted for the same period in 2022, shows that during the latest trading period, the company has seen growth of nearly 16% year-over-year.</p>
<p>While Q3 2023 revenue increased year-over-year, the results for the first nine months showed a slight decrease. The new financial report confirmed that Intralot’s revenue for the first nine months ended September 30, 2023, halted at €280.0 million ($305.8 million). This result, compared to the €301.7 million ($329.5 million) figure posted for the same period in 2022, shows a decrease of 7.2%.</p>

<p>The Company Posted Strong Results, Says CEO and Chairman</p>
<p>Sokratis P. Kokkalis, Intralot’s CEO and chairman, spoke about the latest figures, explaining that the “results demonstrate Intralot’s new strengths returning to NET profits, strong EBITDA growth and cash flow generation, hence fulfilling all the goals we have set out.” He outlined that the company recently completed an important Share Capital Increase by raising funds for a total of €135.0 million ($147.4 million). Finally, Kokkalis said: “I would like to thank all the investors who participated and trusted our vision and capability to deliver even stronger results in the future.”</p>
