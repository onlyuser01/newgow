<p>Scientific Games will provide Entain with its OpenGaming iGaming aggregator for another three years under an extended partnership.</p>
<p>Scientific Games to Provide Entain with iGaming Solutions Through 2024</p>
<p>Entain continues to collaborate with Scientific Games by extending the companies’ existing partnership for additional three years. As a result, Scientific Games will continue to provide Entain with its cutting-edge OpenGaming technology.</p>
<p>Entain spans a swathe of brands that feature established names in multiple international markets, including Ladbrokes, Coral, Gala, PartyCasino, and bwin. Moving forward, these brands will continue to use OpenGaming through at least 2024, subject to possible extensions.</p>
<p>This allows each Entain brand to tap into an extensive selection of over 3,000 games that are supplied by the best gaming studios worldwide. All games come with advanced gamification features that add to the experience in the way of free spins, multipliers, and bonus rounds.</p>
<p>OpenGaming already features consumer-focused tools that focus on responsible gaming and player safety. An added benefit is that OpenGaming seeks full regulatory compliance with each market it’s available in, with the bulk of its operations focused on Europe.</p>
<p>Bolstering Regulatory Presence in Each Market</p>
<p>Scientific Games has been helping Entain brave the German iGaming relaunch, quickly adjusting games and achieving compliance for its partners across the board. The German market is expected to officially relaunch later this year.</p>
<p>Scientific Games will play a key role in bolstering Entain’s efforts in several pivotal markets for the company, including the United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Speaking about these developments, Entain chief product officer Valery Gelfman said that OpenGaming had been an instrumental factor in helping Entain establish its share in regulated markets both in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to OpenGaming and look forward to delivering even more exciting content to our ever-increasing player base,” Gelfman</p>
