    <h1>Hollywood Casino St Louis Hotel Zia Park Casino Hotel Racetrack Four Queens Hotel And Casino Cachuma</h1>

<p>Hello EliasR,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. Could you please advise if you have any evidence of mentioning gambling addiction to the casino? Do I understand it correctly that the casino closed your account after 4 hours of your request?</p>
<p>Please, let me explain you what the difference between closing the account and self-exclusion is:</p>
<p>Some casinos use lots of tools for responsible gambling and I would not mention them here. What players can do if they’re unhappy in the casino: Close the account or self-exclude themselves, those are the two basic choices.</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can reopen account anytime, and casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion, the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances (after cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who are addicted/with gambling problem).</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Nick</p>
