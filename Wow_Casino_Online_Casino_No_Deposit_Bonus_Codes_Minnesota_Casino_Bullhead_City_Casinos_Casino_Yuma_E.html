<p>Gaming technology, content and services supplier EveryMatrix was chosen to deliver its comprehensive turnkey solution to bet-at-home and replace the operator’s existing proprietary platform.</p>
<p>Boost Household Position, Enhance Operations</p>
<p>The agreement between B2B platform provider EveryMatrix and German-based sports betting and gaming operator bet-at-home will see EveryMatrix’s tech stack replace bet-at-home’s exiting platform and power the operator with a modern sportsbook, casino platform, player management, payments, and affiliate software.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, Marco Falchetto, chief executive officer at bet-at-home, outlined the long-standing industry experience of the company which affirmed its strong position in the market akin to a household brand.</p>
<p>“Selecting EveryMatrix as our platform provider will further allow us to keep providing the best service to our 5.5 million registered players while enhancing our operations in key markets,” Falchetto continued, pointing to the boosting effect of the partnership not only in the firm’s sports operations but also in casino.</p>
<p>“With this partnership, a new and exciting phase of bet-at-home development can begin,” he boldly concluded.</p>
<p>Customer-Centric Approach, Extensive Product Offering</p>
<p>With 5.5 million registered players, bet-at-home is a popular brand not only in its core German market but also in Austria and other European markets, growing in popularity since its inception back in 1999 due to its customer-centric approach and extensive product offering.</p>
<p>The agreement for EveryMatrix’s turnkey solution covers all the markets where the Frankfurt-listed operator is currently active.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s group chief executive officer Ebbe Groes also commented on the announcement, stressing the dominating position of bet-at-home in the sports betting vertical across several European markets, happy to contribute to their future success.</p>
<p>Groes then shared his vision that the combination of bet-at-home’s “extensive market and product knowledge” with EveryMatrix’s technology will deliver the goods and even help EveryMatrix learn and grow.</p>
<p>“This landmark agreement reflects the breadth and depth of our products, but especially the quality of our sports platform, OddsMatrix,” Groes added, highlighting that the company’s years-long efforts to further develop its sports platform and invest in innovation are bringing in the desired results as the list of EveryMatrix’s tier-1 operator partnerships continues to grow.</p>
<p>July turned out to be a busy month for EveryMatrix’s dealings in Europe as the gaming content and tech supplier first entered into an agreement with Malta’s National Lottery to provide it with online games and then signed a content deal with 888casino.</p>
