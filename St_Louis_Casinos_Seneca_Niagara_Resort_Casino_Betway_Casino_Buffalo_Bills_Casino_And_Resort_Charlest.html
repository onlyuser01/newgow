<p>A newly amended gaming compact in Wisconsin paves the way for the introduction of sports betting by the Sokaogon Chippewa Community.</p>
<p>Sokaogon Chippewa Community’s Chairman, Robert VanZile Jr. and Governor Tony Evers penned the updated agreement last week. If approved, the agreement would allow the Tribe to offer event wagering at its Mole Lake Casino &amp; Lodge. Additionally, if the updated gambling compact is approved, the Sokaogon Chippewa Community would have the option to offer sports wagering at other sites within its reservation.</p>
<p>To facilitate the new activity, the amended gaming compact changes the conditions and allows the Tribe to offer betting on sports, as well as other events. Although the agreement is already inked, it still seeks regulatory approval. The US Department of Interior now has a 45-day period to review the amended gaming compact.</p>
<p>This is not the first such agreement signed by Governor Evens. In fact, he already inked similar gaming compacts with the Oneida Nation, the Las Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, the Forest County Potawatomi, as well as the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin. Considering the deadline for review by the US Department of Interior, mobile wagering offered by the Sokaogon Chippewa Community may come just in time for the start of the Super Bowl, if not earlier.</p>
<p>Currently, the Department of Administration’s Office of Indian Gaming and Regulatory Compliance (OIGRC) is tasked with the regulation and audits of Tribal operators. This is also the body that ensures regulatory compliance of such operators and oversees the operation of the 11 federally recognized tribes in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>“It is our shared interests that help make these negotiations so successful for the Tribe and the state.“ Kathy Blumenfeld, secretary at the Wisconsin Department of Administration</p>
<p>According to DOA’s Secretary, Kathy Blumenfeld, rolling out sports betting with the Sokaogon Chippewa Community will bring benefits for the Tribe, as well as the state. She acknowledged that the DOA is looking forward to collaborating further with the Tribe in the future.</p>
<p>“This amendment will generate additional revenue for the Tribe and our state, bolster local tourism, and support jobs in Northern Wisconsin—and that’s a win-win for everyone.“ Governor Tony Evers</p>
<p>Governor Evers acknowledged that the updated gaming compact will create benefits for the state and the Tribe. At the same time, he pointed out that the deal will help boost tourism and create new jobs.</p>
<p>“This historic agreement is a win for all parties involved and will mean great things for the Tribe, our enterprises, and the Mole Lake and Crandon areas.“ Robert VanZile Jr, chairman of the Sokaogon Chippewa Community</p>
<p>Chairman VanZile of the Sokaogon Chippewa Community added that the new collaboration will bring economic stimulus not only for the Tribe but the state as well. He explained that the Tribe is looking forward to cooperating with Wisconsin further. Last but not least, Chairman VanZile deemed the amended gaming agreement historic and predicted it will bring benefits to all involved parties.</p>
