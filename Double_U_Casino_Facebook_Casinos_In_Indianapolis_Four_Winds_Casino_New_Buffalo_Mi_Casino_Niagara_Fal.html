    <h1>Double U Casino Facebook Casinos In Indianapolis Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Mi Casino Niagara Fal</h1>

<p>Hi there. I'm almost in a panic. I play at trickz casino. Very lucky. Makes DKK 300 for approximately 3500 euros on dork Unit. Suddenly there are 2 euros in the account. Grabs chat and gets crazy treatment. They have taken my money because I have played for more than 3 euros in stake. (I had just gone from 3 euros to 4 euros. ) 3 taps later, as I said, 2 euros were on my account. She makes all sorts of excuses. I have never received such cynical treatment in my life on any other casino site. I then go in and read the rules, then find out that the max bet is 5 euros. Contact the same person in the chat. Now the tone is different. Now she will send it in to ( don't know who ) and they will investigate it.</p>
<p>the worst thing is that I have won all the money for under 3 euro bet. If I hadn't read the rules, they would have just taken all my money without bothering to help. I really really really hope you will help me. This is so ugly and scam like.. I have taken a lot of screenshot of the conversation. Hope you can help me</p>
<p>etc. Jonas Madsen</p>
