<p>Betano, a Kaizen Gaming online and sports betting brand, has confirmed that has entered into a partnership with soccer club FC Porto for a period of another four years. The collaboration will see the company sponsor the club and work on a number of mutually-beneficial and fan-focused initiatives.</p>
<p>FC Porto Becomes Long-Term Betano Partner</p>
<p>Furthermore, Betano’s signage and assets, including the logo will appear across different digital and physical spaces. The sports betting brand’s logo will continue to be featured on FC Porto player jerseys. Commenting on this partnership, FC Porto president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa said:</p>
<p>“utebol Clube do Porto has always sought to associate itself with great brands and this partnership, the one we have now reinforced with Betano, follows up on that intention; it is a great collaboration of a leading club and a reference brand. FC Porto president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa</p>
<p>Da Costa said that the club was actively seeking to work with the best companies on and off the field and Betano was one such brand. FC Porto remains one of the most prominent soccer clubs in Portugal. Kaizen Gaming CEO George Daskalakis welcomed the opportunity to work with FC Porto.</p>
<p>Daskalakis praised the club’s efforts both in the domestic soccer leagues, but also on the international scene, and argued that it was an honor to be establishing this relationship. One of the biggest motivators for Betano has been the fact that FC Porto is committed for a period of four years, which aligns well with the sports betting brand’s expectations.</p>
<p>Betano previously sponsored FC Porto during the 2021/22 soccer season. This renewed partnership is hoping to bring the company fresh opportunities and achieve better engagement with fans in the long term.</p>
<p>Betano’s Recent Partnership Track Record</p>
<p>Betano has been able to secure many prominent and important partnerships in recent months. The company received the naming rights for the Romanian Football Federation and back in December, Betano and Atlético Mineiro announced an innovative NFT collection together.</p>
<p>The only setback in an otherwise spotless track record is the decision of a German district court asking Betano to reimburse a player. The brand was found guilty of having failed to enforce player limits.</p>
