    <h1>Sandia Casino Buffet Fun Casino Encore Casino Boston Red Rocks Casino Las Vegas Nearest Casino Magic</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I fully understand how difficult the whole situation must be for you. I carefully checked the Bonus Terms on the website, and this is what I found https://www.magicred.com/promotions/:</p>
<p>„When a bet abuses the betting system – regardless of which game it was placed on – it will not count towards a player’s wagering requirements. If the player placed single bets equal to or greater than €4 or €0,50 per line, or 15 percent of the bonus amount before the wagering requirements for the bonus have been met, we reserve the right to withhold any amount in excess of the player’s original deposit from a player’s withdrawal. In addition, if a player deposited with Skrill and placed single bets equal to or greater than €2,50 of the bonus amount before the wagering requirements for the bonus have been met, we reserve the right to withhold any amount in excess of the player’s original deposit from a player’s withdrawal. The foregoing shall also apply to any bonus buy features."</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing higher than allowed bets, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet. You were not stopped or blocked when you decided to increase your bet, and, as a result, you breached the maximum bet rule. Please understand that until you place a request for a withdrawal your bonus is active; hence, all the bonus rules must be followed.</p>
<p>If you are aware of placing higher bets then the allowed ones, sadly, there is not much we can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me if you feel that you’ve been accused mistakenly, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
