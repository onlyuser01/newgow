<p>The leading distributor of iGaming content, 3 Oaks Gaming, announced an important partnership with NetBet, the globally recognized online gaming and betting operator. Details regarding the new partnership emerged Tuesday and see 3 Oaks Gaming significantly expand its global footprint, bolstering its presence in Italy and entering strategic markets such as Mexico.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted partnership, NetBet's clients will benefit from 3 Oaks Gaming's wide range of games. As a result, customers of the operators in different markets will have the option to tap into the company's feature-rich scatter pays slot, Goddess of Egypt, along with recent Hold and Win titles like Forest Spirit, Green Chilli 2 and Little Farm. Moreover, NetBet's customers will be able to experience other thrilling hits from 3 Oaks Gaming, accessing its unique and engaging portfolio of games.</p>
<p>Sebastian Damian, 3 Oaks Gaming's Managing Director, was delighted about the latest collaboration with NetBet. In a statement released on October 31, 2023, he explained: "This deal marks a pivotal moment for 3 Oaks Gaming, enhancing our standing in Europe while expanding our footprint in LatAm." Finally, Damian said: "We firmly believe that our meticulously designed titles will captivate and engage players, offering them an immersive gaming experience."</p>
<p>The latest collaboration represents an important achievement for 3 Oaks Gaming. This is because, through the partnership, the company's extensive range of games will reach new audiences in key markets such as Mexico and Italy.</p>
<p>It was back in March when 3 Oaks Gaming celebrated the debut of its games in Italy via a partnership with the platform provider Tuko Productions. Under the terms of that collaboration, Italian customers gained access to 3 Oaks Gaming's titles for the first time.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the partnership with NetBet, the iGaming content distributor further expands its presence in the regulated gambling market in the country. Undoubtedly, strengthening its foothold in Italy represents an important milestone for 3 Oaks Gaming considering that it is one of the most lucrative markets on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>NetBet was founded more than a decade ago in 2001. Since then, the company has grown to a leading provider of online games that include poker, lotto and live casino titles. Additionally, NetBet also offers sports betting and has established its presence in strategic markets across the globe.</p>
<p>Recently, NetBet strengthened its portfolio of content once again by teaming up with Hacksaw Gaming. The partnership was announced early last month and saw the addition of top-performing games from the iGaming content provider arrive for NetBet customers in the country.</p>
