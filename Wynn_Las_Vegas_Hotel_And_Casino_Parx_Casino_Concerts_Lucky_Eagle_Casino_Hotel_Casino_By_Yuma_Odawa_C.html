    <h1>Wynn Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Parx Casino Concerts Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel Casino By Yuma Odawa C</h1>

<p>It’s Jammy Jack I am reporting.</p>
<p>Account verified officially for 7 days. They did verify it 12 days ago and confirmed it in 2 emails and via support chat but 5 days later decided to un verify and had to re hold of documents 5 times, since been verified again.</p>
<p>I asked for account closure 1st September and for then to remove my contact details from their records and to stop ringing, texting and emailing. I found out via text that my account was re open so gambled. I then challenged why my account was not permanently closed and they advised they only close accounts for 30 days. I asked for refund and they said it would be processed. I had to buy a passport and upload documents and 4 weeks later they decide they won’t give me a refund.</p>
<p>I challenge their self exclusion process and they advise their own internal regulations only mean they lock accounts for 30 days but then I have also found out that users can re open accounts at any time using the chat function so technically they don’t operate any form of self exclusion.</p>
<p>I have emailed lots of time and spoke to chat agents for 6 hours and they Would not close account permanently or for a set period - they say their systems don’t allow this. I said I have gambling problems and they just don’t log in and or don’t use the chat function re open facility. Basically it’s my problem if I re open account.</p>
<p>My account is closed after I had to re request this but I can re open the account at any time using the live chat facility. I have asked for data to be deleted, account blocked but they refuse.</p>
<p>I spoke to them yesterday with lots of emails and 2 chat contact with agents asking for the refund, to close account and to establish licence arrangements, security of accounts and documents.</p>
