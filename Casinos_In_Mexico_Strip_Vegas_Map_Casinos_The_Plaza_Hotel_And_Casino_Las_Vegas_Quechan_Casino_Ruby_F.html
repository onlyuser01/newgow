<p>SBC Summit continues to lock in new event dates as the SBC Summit North America 2023 has been officially confirmed for next year. The event is going to take place from May 9 through May 11 and be held at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, New Jersey. The hosts have confirmed that the new event will be bigger as it reflects the growing demand for industry expos where the increasing number of gaming professionals in North America can meet and swap know-how.</p>
<p>The tradeshow &amp; conference has been running since 2019 and it will now bring more professionals from Canada and the United States together. The 2022 tickets were sold months in advance and this is likely to be the case for the 2023 event as well. Commenting on the new event dates and plans to accommodate even more delegates, SBC CEO and founder Rasmus Sojmark noted:</p>
<p>"SBC Summit North America has developed into an unmissable event for businesses that want to reach and connect with major U.S. and Canadian sportsbook, igaming and land-based casino operators, launch products into these fast-growing markets, and learn about the latest developments."</p>
<p>Sojmark confirmed that the decision to expand the area of the event reflected the increased interest in the exposition and the growing number of suppliers and stakeholders now operating in the North American market. That is why SBC has decided to lock next year’s date even before the 2022 expo, which is set forJuly 12-14 next month.</p>
<p>This year’s expo will also talk about a number of developments in and around the industry, including igaming, media and professional sports, payments technologies, investment opportunities, tribal casinos, and state lotteries, and more.</p>
<p>There will be a number of big companies attending the 2022 edition, with Sojmark confident that even more will be available next year. The 2022’s edition will unit BetMGM, DraftKings, Foxwoods, Las Vegas Sands, NASCAR, NFL, Penn National Gaming, Bally’s Interactive, Kindred Group, Foxwoods, and many other representatives.</p>
<p>SBC Summit North America 2022 will touch on important topics such as online gaming and player protection.</p>
