<p>DraftKings has secured more content for its New Jersey operations, thanks to a new deal with Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group, a content-driven iGaming technology provider, announced the launch of its content and technology in the state of New Jersey through its agreement with the gambling giant DraftKings.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Supplies DraftKings’ NJ Operations with Games</p>
<p>As agreed by the two companies, Bragg will roll out some of its best gambling titles in the state, powering DraftKings with exclusive content. Bragg will power the operator with some of its proprietary hits, including games like Egyptian Magic, Fairy Dust and the Girl with the Golden Eyes.</p>
<p>In addition, DraftKings will get access to aggregated content from Bragg Gaming’s partnering studios. New Jersey gamblers can find the newly-added games at casino.draftkings.com.</p>
<p>The agreement expands the existing relationship between Bragg Gaming and DraftKings, adding new benefits for the two companies. For Bragg Gaming, this agreement represents an opportunity to expand the company’s US reach and improve its overall North American Footprint.</p>
<p>DraftKings, on the other hand, will further enhance its offering with Bragg Content, as it already has in other markets. In 2022, the operator adopted Bragg’s RGS tech and content in Michigan and added Bragg-developed Spin Games RGS in New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.</p>
<p>Bragg Is Thrilled to Bolster Its NA Presence</p>
<p>Lara Falzon, Bragg Gaming Group’s president and chief operating officer, commented on the new agreement. She said that the launch of Bragg’s content with DraftKings in New Jersey attests to the quality of the company’s products, as well as to its successful expansion strategy.</p>
<p>Falzon added that the launch of Bragg’s RGS technology and content with DraftKings will further consolidate the provider’s reach in the NA region.</p>
<p>The rollout of our new RGS technology and content in the market with DraftKings is an important step forward in expanding the availability of our new U.S. content to a new group of players in one of the country’s largest iCasino markets. Lara Falzon, COO, Bragg Gaming</p>
<p>The COO added that her team is happy to deepen its ties with DraftKings and supply the famous gambling and sports betting operator with best-in-class technology and content.</p>
<p>We are pleased to build on our relationship with DraftKings and look forward to providing their New Jersey players with engaging content that delivers a great gaming entertainment experience. Lara Falzon, COO, Bragg Gaming</p>
<p>Bragg has been busily expanding its US foothold through various strategic deals. In early December 2022, the company doubled down on Michigan, launching its games with BetMGM. In more recent news, Bragg onboarded Swint games in a deal that will expand the two parties’ presence in the Netherlands. Lastly, Bragg just penned a strategic partnership with First Look Games.</p>
