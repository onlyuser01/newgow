    <h1>Hollywood Park Casino Parking Paradise Sweepstakes Casino Montbleu Resort Casino Casino Del Sol Bing</h1>

<p>iGaming developer with a clear focus on mobile OneTouch has launched Raiden Medal Burst, a fresh video slot with a nostalgic feel. The game was inspired by the prestigious Raiden series of arcade games popular in the nineties. The developer invites players to destroy their enemies’ crafts while collecting generous payouts in a game that the company’s head Madis Raus called “a bold release.”</p>

<p>Get Ready to Touch the Skies</p>
<p>Raiden Medal Burst allows players to gain control over a futuristic warplane and fight off a number of enemies on their intergalactic journey up in the skies. The game’s jet design is top-tier and the production value makes this title an excellent option for thrill-seekers looking to be carried back to their teen years. As mentioned earlier, the game has found its inspiration in the popular Raiden games released as an arcade game series more than three decades ago. The original series recorded a huge rate of success, and fresh additions kept attracting more gamers all over the planet.</p>
<p>OneTouch wanted to preserve the well-established style of the original game and this is shown through a number of elements. The list includes the Raiden jet displayed at the bottom, the Stacked Medal symbols that players must land to destroy their enemies’ crafts, and the Unknown Pollution background music chosen by the developer.</p>
<p>A Game Drenched in Nostalgia</p>
<p>Raiden Medal Burst’s grid is packed with both high-paying and low-paying symbols, including classic cards, enemies, and futuristic-looking warplanes with amazing designs. Players are also introduced to a series of special symbols including the Stacked Medal symbols leading the way to the Free Spins feature. Depending on the number of Stacked Medal symbols a player finds, they get to trigger a certain number of Free Spins ranging from three to five.</p>
<p>High-paying symbols can be replaced with Medal symbols during the Free Spins feature, triggering bigger payouts. It is also possible to get a Wild reel on the third reel during the same feature and scoop up more extra free spins when landing more Stacked Medal symbols. The developer has added a nice touch to the action to heighten the overall experience by having the Raiden jet take off once the Free Spins feature is triggered. This gives gamers a nostalgic throwback to the original series.</p>
<p>OneTouch is convinced that the new video slot will deliver a lot of excitement to the gameboard, especially when it comes to players who were already fans of the series. Last April, Relax Gaming decided to sign an agreement to integrate OneTouch Technology’s suite into its offerings.</p>
