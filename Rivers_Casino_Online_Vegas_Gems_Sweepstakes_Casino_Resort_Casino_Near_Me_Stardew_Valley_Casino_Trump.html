<p>The award-winning digital business-to-business (B2B) platform and service provider for the iGaming sector, Shape Games, announced a new partnership with the leading online betting operator in South Africa which is a division of Sun International Group, SunBet. Announced Thursday, the new collaboration seeks to elevate the experiences for customers of the leading online betting operator through innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, SunBet will benefit from delivering a personalized experience for its growing customer base. This will be achieved via the implementation of Shape Games' native app frontend, which will ultimately boost the customer experience.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Kambi, Shape Games offers sportsbook services, powering the operator's retail, as well as online gambling operators. Via the company's partnership with Bede, it also offers PAM solutions. Ultimately, the latest partnership is expected to revolutionize the experience for SunBet clients within the regulated gambling market in South Africa.</p>
<p>Morten Tonnesen, Shape Games CCO, shared his excitement about the freshly minted partnership in a statement. He explained that the deal with SunBet represents a milestone achievement for the company while at the same time pointing out that it will deliver unrivaled experiences for South African players.</p>
<p>Tonnesen added: "It’s not only our first client in Africa but also a significant win for us, as we bring another valued client of Kambi on board." Finally, Shape Games CCO explained: "We are proud that SunBet has entrusted us with the task of bringing best-in-class, native app experience for both Android and iOS users."</p>
<p>Simon Gregory, SunBet's CEO, was similarly thrilled regarding the latest partnership with Shape Games. "The customer experience has been at the forefront of SunBet which has been one of the driving factors of our recent growth," he explained. Last but not least, Gregory said: "By partnering with Shape Games our goal is to enhance our customer’s gaming experience by delivering a native app for our Android and Apple users that is best in class, and will deliver a phenomenal, personalized user experience which will make our users love every moment at SunBet."</p>
<p>About a year ago, Kambi acquired Shape Games. With that in mind, the duo has been actively collaborating since November 2017. However, since the acquisition, Shape Games successfully engaged with clients from Kambi, reaffirming the remarkable synergy created by the business combination. The latest partnership further underlines the success of the acquisition, allowing more iGaming and retail operators to benefit from Shape Games' leading solutions that elevate customer experiences.</p>
