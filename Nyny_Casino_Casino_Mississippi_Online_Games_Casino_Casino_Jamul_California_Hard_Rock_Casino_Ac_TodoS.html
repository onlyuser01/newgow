    <h1>Nyny Casino Casino Mississippi Online Games Casino Casino Jamul California Hard Rock Casino Ac TodoS</h1>

<p>In one of the casinos regulated by the DGOJ (www.todoslots.es) I have had a problem regarding the modification of the deposit limits.</p>
<p>The events occurred on February 2. User: Luiii22</p>
<p>First, I requested a reduction in my limits to € 50 per day, € 50 per week and € 50 per month. It was passed.</p>
<p>Once this amount had been played, I requested an increase of the same to € 100 per day / week / month and it was automatically granted (without meeting a period of 7 days as it was my first request for an increase, nor did the casino provide me with the responsible test).</p>
<p>What was my surprise, that by continuing to increase these limits they were automatically granted to me. I managed to increase the deposit limit of € 100 by € 100, until spending € 600. Said limits were accepted automatically, thus inciting compulsive gambling by the player and without respecting current regulations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the responsible gambling tools on this website are very poor. They only let the player exclude himself for a maximum of 30 days or close his account, but they emphasized that he could reopen it whenever he wanted (I have a copy of the conversation with customer att.). I repeat that they incite compulsive gambling with these tools.</p>
<p>It is the first time that this situation occurs to me. In other casinos regulated by the DGOJ, they have ALWAYS provided me with the responsible gambling test and blocked the deposit increase (whatever the amount, as long as the player has made a previous decrease in the limits) until the deadlines are met.</p>
<p>I claim the refund of the € 600. A formal complaint has been made with the DGOJ.</p>
<p>A greeting.</p>
