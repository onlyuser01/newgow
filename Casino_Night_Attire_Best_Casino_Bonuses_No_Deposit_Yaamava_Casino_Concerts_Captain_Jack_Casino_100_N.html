<p>MVB Financial Becoming Premier Bank for Online Betting</p>

<p>MVB Financial (NASDAQ: MVBF), a sleepy West Virginia-based financial institution, is rapidly shedding its image as a small-town bank to become the premier option for the online gaming industry.</p>

<p>With a market value of nearly $325 million, MVB Financial resides in micro-cap territory, but its increasingly dominant internet wagering footprint is getting the attention of Wall Street analysts. In a note to clients on Monday, JPMorgan analyst Steven Alexopoulos initiated coverage of the financial services stock with an “overweight” rating and a $35 price target, implying upside of 40% from the February 24 close. He’s just the fifth analyst to cover MVB.</p>
<p>Combining a strong management team with an intense focus on serving underserved niche markets with significant growth prospects, MVB has transformed its deposit franchise,” Alexopoulos wrote in his report.</p>
<p>The analyst added MVB Financial is transitioning from a small regional bank to “the Silicon Valley Bank” for the internet gaming space. Prior to the tech boom in the 1990s, Silicon Valley Bank was a mostly anonymous bank known only to depositors in Northern California. Today, its parent company, SIVB Financial (NASDAQ: SIVB), has a market value of $17.10 billion.</p>
<p>MVB Financial Has Strong Gaming Ties</p>
<p>While West Virginia is home to land-based casinos and allows internet casinos and mobile sports wagering, MVB Financial’s opportunity set extends well beyond its home state.</p>
<p>CEO Larry Mazza is a co-owner of ProFootballTalk, which provides content to NBC Sports. NBC Sports has established relationships with major sportsbook operators. Mazza’s ties to ProFootballTalk could be one reason MVB already commands 85% of the market for banking in the regulated online betting industry. At the very least, that relationship doesn’t hurt the bank’s case when it comes to earning business from gaming companies.</p>
<p>Currently, MVB has about $900 million of deposits on its book from customers of sportsbook operators such as DraftKings and FanDuel. That’s nearly a third of the bank’s overall deposits, and the benefit of deposits from bettors is that MVB doesn’t have to pay interest on that capital — a significant advantage at a time when interest rates are high.</p>
<p>Roughly half of MVB’s current deposits don’t require the bank to pay interest, up from just 10% six years ago, according to the financial services institution.</p>
<p>MVB Financial First Mover Advantage</p>
<p>While rivals slept on catering to regulated sportsbooks, MVB capitalized on that opportunity, which could pay long-term dividends for the bank and its investors.</p>
<p>“Just as Silicon Valley Bank is the hub that connects the players in the innovation economy, we see MVB establishing a first mover position with players across the online gaming industry including the operators, technology providers, alternative online gambling providers, as well as media partners,” noted JPMorgan’s Alexopoulos.</p>
<p>The analyst lauded MVB’s focus on underserved segments, adding that its first-mover advantage in online gaming presents it with a “‘blue ocean’ opportunity to become the bank of choice for online sports betting and online gaming operators.”</p>
