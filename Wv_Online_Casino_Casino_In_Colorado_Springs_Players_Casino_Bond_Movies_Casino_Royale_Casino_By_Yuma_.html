    <h1>Wv Online Casino Casino In Colorado Springs Players Casino Bond Movies Casino Royale Casino By Yuma</h1>

<p>Tiidal Gaming, a leading gaming and esports platform, and Sportsflare have partnered with EveryMatrix. Sportsflare is a fully owned subsidiary by Tiidal Gaming, and its betting solutions will be integrated into EveryMatrix’s sportsbook.</p>
<p>Details About the Agreement Revealed</p>
<p>With this partnership, the OddsMatrix solution by EveryMatrix will be integrated with the BetBuilder esports product by Sportsflare. As a same-game parlay solution for esports, BetBuilder uses advanced algorithms to account for any combination of events.</p>
<p>Tiidal Gaming’s chief technology officer, Max Polaczuk, shared a few words on BetBuilder. He said that the solution is designed to improve the betting experience as it drives higher customer engagement. Still, at the same time, it offers “high margins for operators” compared to the industry standards.</p>
<p>Polaczuk also added that thanks to the integration with the iGaming platform of EveryMatrix, the advanced technology solution of Tiidal Gaming would increase global distribution as it is unique in the esports industry.</p>
<p>He also added a few words on Tiidal Gaming’s expansion and said that growing globally is the company’s main goal at the moment and the EveryMatrix partnership is a step in the right direction. Back in July, Sportsflare partnered with HUDstats to bring innovation to e-sports betting.</p>
<p>In an interview with GamblingNews, the CCO of Sportsflare, Virgil Townsend, stated that esports betting is not something new, and it is no longer a niche and has “so much room to grow.”</p>
<p>The BetBuilder Platform Will Provide Numerous Great Services to EveryMatrix</p>
<p>According to Tiidal Gaming, some of the services that BetBuilder will provide to EveryMatrix include numerous combinations for in-game outcomes, increased fan engagement, innovative proposition markets for players for k/d ratio, most kills, etc., as well as one of the main services of BetBuilder – higher margin for operators.</p>
<p>Thanks to this solution, EveryMatrix will continue to grow globally. So far, the company has more than 120 clients in various markets. As a leading B2B provider, EveryMatrix provides various iGaming services for online casinos and sportsbooks.</p>
<p>It is also present on the regulated US market, and recently, the company stated that OddsMatrix had a record turnover in Q4 of 2021. According to official data released by EveryMatrix, the turnover of its sportsbook solution was $133 million per month in total bets.</p>
<p>Ebbe Groes, the group CEO, stated that numbers don’t lie and that the OddsMatrix solution proved to be far more successful than the original projections. Groes also added that the talented OddsMatrix team would continue improving and expanding. In October, EveryMatrix also launched Managed Services, which helps clients support across numerous fields, including payment solutions, acquisition, and retention marketing.</p>
