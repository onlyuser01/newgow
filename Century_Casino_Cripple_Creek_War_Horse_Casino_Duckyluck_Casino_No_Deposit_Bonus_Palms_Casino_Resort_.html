    <h1>Century Casino Cripple Creek War Horse Casino Duckyluck Casino No Deposit Bonus Palms Casino Resort</h1>

<p>The previous season of the English Premier League was very stressful for fans of both Everton and Chelsea. The Toffees barely avoided relegation and then lost a couple of crucial players during the summer transfer window (e.g., Richarlison). Chelsea, on the other hand, went through a takeover process after former owner Roman Abramovich got sanctioned by the UK Government.</p>
<p>In the 2022-23 season, it should be a better situation for both teams. However, no one can say for certain whether the two will get back to their former glory. Nevertheless, we expect to see both teams perform at a very good level on Saturday, August 6. That’s when they meet at Goodison Park in Round 1 of the Premier League.</p>

<p>Everton’s Boss Frank Lampard in the Hot Seat?</p>
<p>Judging by the betting odds available at a number of leading betting sites, Frank Lampard is the main candidate to win the sack race. The odds of him being the first manager to leave the post are set at +400. In comparison, Chelsea’s manager Thomas Tuchel is priced at +1500.</p>
<p>It’s not just about bookmakers; many Premier League pundits don’t have faith in Lampard, based on this team’s disappointing performances in the previous season. The thing is that Everton’s roster looked really well last year, but the Toffees finished the season in the #16 position – just two spots above the relegation zone.</p>
<p>Their 2022-23 roster also looks very decent, but it’s up to Lampard to make the most of this team. We think that he does have what it takes to lead Everton through the season. However, we don’t think his boys are going to do much in Saturday’s game.</p>
<p>The Start of a New Era in Chelsea</p>
<p>This club achieved its greatest moments during the Abramovich era. However, he’s no longer the club owner. Instead, it’s Todd Boehly, an American entrepreneur famous for being the owner of DraftKings. Since the takeover, a big pile of money has been added to Chelsea’s transfer budget. However, we didn’t see the Blues spend too much on signings.</p>
<p>One of their biggest signings of the summer is Kalidou Koulibaly who came from Napoli as a replacement for Antonio Rudiger, after his departure to Real Madrid. Chelsea also signed Raheem Sterling, an England international who played for Manchester City in the past seven seasons.</p>
<p>What the Blues still haven’t done is sign a center forward to fill in the gap left by Romelu Lukaku. They need a striker desperately as Timo Werner has decided to move away from Stamford Bridge by the end of summer. What all this means is that Chelsea is practical without a proper striker, with Kai Havertz expected to be in charge of goal scoring at the start of the season.</p>
<p>Everton vs Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>Chelsea is a better team than Everton, there’s no doubt about that. However, winning at Goodison Park isn’t going to be easy for the boys from London. This is going to be one very difficult game, but we think Chelsea will get a win eventually.</p>
<p>Picks: Chelsea to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
