<p>Cleveland Guardians, a prominent Major League Baseball franchise, has signed bet365 as its official mobile sports betting partner. This comes in the wake of sports gambling legalization in Ohio where placing a wager on the outcome of baseball games has been legal since January 1.</p>
<p>The Buckeye State-based franchise is happy to enter what is a multi-year partnership that will bring fresh opportunities for the team’s fans and bet365 as a licensed operator in the regulated sports betting market.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the sportsbook said that the company was pleased to be launching with the Guardians, one of the most beloved sports franchises in the state. "The Guardians’ rich history is deep-rooted in the Cleveland community, and we’re excited to become part of their exciting future," the statement read.</p>
<p>The Guardians had a strong 2022, and the team is now looking to build upon this success and make an even bigger impact in 2023. Guardians VP of Corporate and Premium PartnershipsTed Baugh hailed the opportunity to work with bet365 and their team, and partner as the official mobile sports betting partner for the team.</p>
<p>He further praised bet365’s global reach which easily numbers more than 90 million registered customers around the globe. Bet365, remarked Baugh, will help the team to introduce a number of complementary experiences to fans. The partnership will be introduced to fans in a more celebratory manner at the upcoming Guards Fest which will be held on Saturday, January 21 at the Huntington Convention Center.</p>
<p>Bet365 confirmed that it is looking forward to engaging in a more meaningful way with fans at the upcoming pow-wow. As to the company’s reach in the United States, Ohio is in fact a third state where the operator has gone live, following previous launches in New Jersey and Colorado.</p>
<p>Ohio has been one of the most significant state launches in the United States. Early data by GeoComply, a geolocation specialist, indicated that the state has led the way ahead of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and others in terms of geolocation transactions in the year hours and days of 2023.</p>
<p>Catena, a global gaming behemoth, shared a similar update, in which the company outlined that it has had the strongest results to date from launching in a new state with Ohio beating any other fresh launches, even New York in 2022.</p>
