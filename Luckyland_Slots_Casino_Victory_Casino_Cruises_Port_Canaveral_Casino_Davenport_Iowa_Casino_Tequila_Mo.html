<p>The operator is excited to grow its presence in professional tennis</p>
<p>A few days after securing an online betting license in Illinois, global gambling leader Betway has expanded its global tennis portfolio with the addition of the National Bank Open presented by Rogers. The addition of the Toronto event comes a day before its start.</p>
<p>This year’s iteration of the National Bank Open will take place in Toronto between August 5 and 13. It is a part of the ATP Masters 1000. The tennis competition will be hosted at the Sobeys Stadium with the finals set to take place at the 10,800 capacity Centre Court.</p>
<p>In addition, Betway has secured a multi-year deal that will see its logo promoted across the Sobeys Stadium. The operator’s logo will be visible on the backwall throughout all days of the tournament.</p>
<p>The gambling brand added that the upcoming tournament will be the first game in Toronto for the newly crowned Wimbledon champion and World Number 1 Carlos Alcaraz. The tennis star will play his opening match during the night session on August 9, Betway added.</p>
<p>Betway praised Canada for having hosted hundreds of memorable tennis events since 1881, welcoming legendary champions such as Bjorn Borg, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic on its courts.</p>
<p>Betway Is Excited to Bolster Its Sports Portfolio</p>
<p>Betway Group’s chief executive officer, Anthony Werkman, said that his team is excited to grow its tennis portfolio with another sponsorship deal. He welcomed the National Bank Open to the Betway family and praised the tournament for its long history of delivering excitement to sports fans.</p>
<p>This competition is steeped in history and is a firm-favorite for tennis fans, so we’re obviously very excited to be a partner as we continue to be known as the number one betting brand within tennis. Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway Group</p>
<p>The deal was also welcomed by Rob Swann, Tennis Canada’s chief commercial officer, who expressed his excitement about the partnership with the gambling operator.</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with Betway and welcome them to our incredible group of corporate partners. Rob Swann, CCO, Tennis Canada</p>
<p>Swann said that his team is looking forward to working closely with Betway throughout this multi-year agreement. He promised that the two parties will work together on delivering exceptional fan experiences.</p>
<p>Several days ago, Betway teamed up with Greentube, strengthening the two companies’ presence in Belgium. Earlier, the operator adopted the European Gaming and Betting Association’s guidelines in order to fight money laundering.</p>
