<p>Betano gets behind Atletico Mineiro in what is a first commercial partnership for the sports betting giant in Brazil.</p>
<p>Atletico Mineiro Welcomes New Flagship Partner</p>
<p>Sports betting company Betano has signed its first partnership with a sports outfit in Brazil, becoming the latest sponsor of soccer club Atletico Mineiro. The betting firm’s logo now appears on the soccer club’s shirts in Serie A of the Brazilian Championship.</p>
<p>The first game Atletico Mineiro played displaying the logo of their new sponsor was against Bragantino on Monday. However, there may be some headwinds coming as Atletico’s former partner, BMG, has contested the club’s decision and said that it did not recognize the partnership between Atletico and Betano as valid.</p>
<p>In BMG’s opinion, it still remained the main sponsor of the sports outfit. The official statement released by Atletico omitted a mention of BMG’s claim, with the club’s president Sergio Batista Coelho saying that the team was delighted to have teamed up with Betano, a leading brand in the country and a company that shares the same values as Atletico.</p>
<p>Together with Betano, Coelho said, the companies will seek to create experiences worthy of the club’s fans. While Betano is just breaking ground in Brazil, the company has been actively seeking out partnerships with sports clubs all over the world.</p>
<p>It has already signed with SC Braga and CS Maritimo, two Portuguese soccer clubs and another partnership is currently ongoing with Universitatea Craiova in Romania and PAOK FC in Greece. The company is also sponsoring Apollon Limassol and Pafos in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Betano’s positioning is not random either. The company is, like many other stakeholders, expecting a ruling in April 2021 that will determine the course Brazil’s sports betting industry will take in the future.</p>
<p>Sports betting in Latin America and Brazil, in particular, are expected to be huge, and the region has enticed interest from the biggest names in the industry already.</p>
