    <h1>Midnight Rose Hotel And Casino Casino Colusa Ca Louisiana Hotels And Casinos Rio Hotel And Casino Re</h1>

<p>The launches are in line with the company’s ambition to become the go-to gaming supplier in North America</p>
<p>PlayAGS, a leading supplier of casino products and services, announced that it has secured approval to launch its portfolio of high-performing electronic gaming machines (EGMs) and table games in two new US jurisdictions. According to the announcement, the provider will now be able to supply products to casino operators in the states of Colorado and Missouri.</p>
<p>The launch in these two jurisdictions will help PlayAGS expand its presence in the United States, in line with the company’s ambition to become the go-to gaming supplier in North America.</p>
<p>The entrance into these two new jurisdictions follows the launch of the provider’s cutting-edge portrait cabinet Spectra UR43. PlayAGS’ latest state-of-the-art machine features the beloved Triple Coin Treasures games, a series of titles proven to resonate with American consumers.</p>
<p>Triple Coin Treasures will be some of the first products PlayAGS will launch in Colorado and Missouri, allowing local fans to see what the fuss is all about. According to PlayAGS, fans will be able to find Triple Coin Treasures in a selection of Colorado casinos, including Century Casino &amp; Hotel Central City, Golden Nugget Cripple Creek and Monarch Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk. Missouri fans, on the other hand, should seek PlayAGS’ titles at Horseshoe St. Louis, River City Casino Hotel, Hollywood Casino St. Louis, Argosy Casino Hotel &amp; Spa, Harrah’s Kansas City, Bally’s Kansas City Casino and Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City.</p>
<p>PlayAGS Is Excited to Offer Premium Products to More US Players</p>
<p>AGS’ senior vice president and general manager of slots, Mark DeDeaux, commented on the launches in Colorado and Missouri, saying that the new licenses form a “meaningful piece of AGS’ overall growth strategy.” They follow a recent expansion of PlayAGS’ team and an expansion of the company’s overall global presence.</p>
<p>DeDeaux concluded that his team is looking forward to engaging players in the new states with exciting gaming products:</p>
<p>We are pleased to be able to offer our high-performing, chart-topping new products to customers in both the Colorado and Missouri markets. Mark DeDeaux, SVP &amp; general manager of slots, AGS</p>
<p>In the meantime, PlayAGS continues to grow, as demonstrated by the company’s recent financial results. In early August, the supplier published its Q2 2023 results, reporting record-breaking revenue of $89.8 million. The company continues to see its metrics increase across the board, attesting to the efficiency of its business strategy.</p>
