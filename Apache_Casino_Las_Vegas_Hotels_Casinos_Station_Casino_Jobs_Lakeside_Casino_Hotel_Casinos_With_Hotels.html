<p>Sports wagering results across the nation are on the up, with Pennsylvania posting one of the highest numbers on Tuesday and clocking in $900 million in total wagers</p>
<p>The total revenue for November 2023 was $444 million, or a contraction of 1.74% compared to results posted during the same month last year. Regardless, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board and the industry as a whole have much to be cheerful about.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Soars with Two Notable Winners</p>
<p>This is the first time that the state’s sports wagering handle crossed the $900 million threshold, in line with betting moods all over the nation, which drove New York’s handle well past the $2.2-billion mark.</p>
<p>Sports wagering handle halted at $934.1 million in November, with the total revenue scored by 18 sportsbooks and operators sitting at $12.88 million. Naturally, online revenue once again pulled ahead with $10.3 million of the total, trailed by $2.56 million by retail operations. Some venues did fairly well in terms of retail performance, but results were generally low.</p>
<p>The winner in retail was the Parx Casino which drove a revenue of $756,756 from in-person wagers, and ahead of the $252,573 generated through online wagers, for a total of $1 million of the total revenue. Parx Casino saw a handle of $24.47m, well beyond the leaders in the segment.</p>
<p>Valley Forge Casino Resort and Hollywood Casino at the Meadows posted negligible retail revenue results, $13,255 and $20,451 respectively, but they soared in terms of total betting handle and online revenue. The Valley Forge Casino Resort property managed to pull a total of $384 million in terms of sports wagering handle, translating into $8.38 million in terms of online revenue.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino at the Meadows was a distant second with the sports wagering handle hitting $253 million and translating into $7.8 million revenue. All in all, Hollywood Casino at the Meadows had the better hold of the two properties.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino at Penn Flags in Sports But Dominates iGaming</p>
<p>Most other results paled in comparison with one notable loser being Hollywood Casino at Penn National, which managed a total handle of $66.8 million but ended up losing $16,394 in retail and $7.8 million on online wagers.</p>
<p>In terms of overall revenue and operations, most of the companies saw a contraction compared to their results last year. Even Hollywood Casino at Penn and Valley Forge Casino Resort posted -6.45% and -6.26% when factoring in the revenue from all of their operations, including casino gaming.</p>
<p>The biggest winner from iGaming revenue was Hollywood Casino at Penn National which outperformed everyone in the iSlots and iTables verticals, topping the revenue chart with $61.1 million. The monthly results for this entire sector stood at $158 million.</p>
