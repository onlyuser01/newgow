    <h1>Longhorn Casino Hotel Slotocash Casino Login Casinos In Vegas Des Moines Casino Pokerstars Casino Bo</h1>

<p>I have been trying to withdraw from my account balance (totaling 819.85 â‚¬) for over two months (since November 2022) without success.</p>
<p>In my deposit page I have the following options: credit cards, crypto currency, MuchBetter and AstroPay.</p>
<p>However, both crypto currency and MuchBetter give the following error: "Our billing system is unable to accept this deposit at the moment.". Their customer service have told me that it is because their system is not accepting cryptocurrency or MuchBetter at the moment.</p>
<p>Therefore, I only have credit cards and AstroPay available as working deposit options. I have made deposits with my Visa credit card (which is the only credit card I got) and with my AstroPay account.</p>
<p>Withdrawals are only allowed to payment methods with which one has made at least one successful deposit and to wire transfer. I have made many withdrawal requests to my Visa credit card, AstroPay account and to my bank account as a wire transfer, but all of those requests have been declined.</p>
<p>I have been asking about this matter many times from their customer service during the last two months, but all they keep saying is that I should try another payment method and they don't seem to understand that I don't have any other options. They keep suggesting MuchBetter and cryptocurrency although those methods give an error message when trying to deposit and another customer service person has already said that those methods are not supported at the moment.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can only deposit with my Visa credit card or AstroPay, but as they are declining all withdrawal requests to those methods and to wire transfer, it is impossible for me to withdraw.</p>
