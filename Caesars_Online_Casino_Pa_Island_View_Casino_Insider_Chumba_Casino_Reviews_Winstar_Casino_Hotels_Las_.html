<p>The leading iGaming publisher, Yggdrasil, confirmed it joined forces with Bulletproof Games to deliver a thrilling new slot game that brings engaging experiences for the players and chances for significant prizes. On Tuesday, the duo announced the introduction of Diamond Symphony DoubleMax, a new 5-reel slot game incorporating the popular DoubleMax Game Engagement Mechanic (GEM).</p>
<p>Further elevating the experience for online players, the recent slot game offers free spins, as well as the Cascade+ mechanic, which grants a chance for bigger payouts. Yggdrasil and Bulletproof Games’ latest slot features a musical theme and combines quality graphics with crisp sound effects.</p>

<p>The New Game Delivers Thrilling Experiences</p>
<p>Released on June 20, 2023, Diamond Symphony DoubleMax uses symbols that include different musical notes. At the same time, the game offers special high-paying symbols, including musical instruments such as a violin, piano and more. As the name suggests, the game has a Diamond symbol as well.</p>
<p>Michael Bullock, Bulletproof Games’ product director, explained that the new game delivers an exciting experience for online players. According to him, the slot game incorporates engaging features and mechanics that create thrilling gameplay. Finally, Bullock predicted that the new game will be well-received by the online players.</p>
<p>“The excitement levels for Diamond Symphony DoubleMax is at an all-time high amongst our team here at Bulletproof.“ Michael Bullock, product director at Bulletproof Games</p>
<p>Mark McGinley, Yggdrasil’s chief gaming officer, was similarly delighted about the recently released game. He explained that the company’s DoubleMax mechanic has proven its popularity. Additionally, McGinley said that Yggdrasil was excited to collaborate with Bulletproof Games for the recently released slot. Finally, he said: “We’re confident Diamond Symphony DoubleMax will be music to the ears of operators and players alike as it lands in casino lobbies in the days and weeks to come.”</p>
<p>Cascade+ Mechanic, Free Spins and Encore Mode</p>
<p>Thanks to the DoubleMax mechanic, players of Diamond Symphony DoubleMax have a chance to secure a prize of up to x20,000 their stake. Combining free spins and the Cascade+ mechanic further elevates the potential for big payouts. “The DoubleMax GEM ensures each cascading win increases a win multiplier by x2 and up to a maximum of x256, resulting in impressive prizes,” explained Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Cascade+ mechanic, winning symbols are removed from the reel, enabling new symbols to fall into their place. This, in turn, can bring consequent wins. The engaging new title also offers a “free spins trail.” This functionality enables the players to track their progress toward free spins by securing consequent wins. The free spins trail allows the players to climb up, granting them between seven and 15 free spins.</p>
<p>Diamond Symphony DoubleMax offers an engaging functionality called Encore mode. This functionality enables the players to have a higher chance of winning a bonus in exchange for a 50% additional cost of their stake. According to Yggdrasil, Encore mode helps convert two “losing positions on the trail to respin positions.”</p>
<p>Taking the customer experience to a whole new level, Diamond Symphony DoubleMax also offers two Buy Bonus options. The cost for those options is 100x or 200x of the player’s stake but grants a chance for significant payouts, as well as free spins.</p>
