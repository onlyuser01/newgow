<p>Wild Streak review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Wild Streak takes players to a fiery realm of fruit.</p>
<p>Zesty lemons, ripe cherries, and tantalizing plums all await players on the reels of this classic slot. Plenty of luxurious golden embellishments ensure a particularly upscale atmosphere.</p>
<p>Fans of fruit machine themes will especially appreciate Wild Streak.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Among the symbols, players will first notice mouthwatering fruit symbols, including dewy watermelons, fresh grapes, and some classic cherries. Each fruit is animated in a vivid, realistic style that makes for enticing imagery.</p>
<p>Bells, stars, and a flaming horseshoe also appear on the reels. These symbols all seem to give a nod to vintage slot aesthetics.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are made of gold, with ornate accents at each corner. Abstracted red flame motifs surround the reels, making players feel as if they have entered the heart of a fire.</p>
<p>Wild Streak’s moody soundtrack adds a dramatic vibe to this slot’s atmosphere. A subtle rock feel is added by electric guitar chords for some additional cool factor.</p>
<p>The graphics and animation combine to create a retro fruit machine impression.</p>
<p>Paytable for the Wild Streak slot machine</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wild Streak is a five-reel, three-row slot with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>The swift gameplay ensures players will remain engaged as they play Wild Streak.</p>
<p>Players may opt to use the Gamble feature to risk their winnings for a chance at doubling the payout. The dealer and the player pick cards, and if the player’s card beats the dealer’s, they receive twice their winnings. However, if the dealer’s pick wins, the winnings are lost.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol appears on reels 2, 3, and 4, and substitutes for all symbols with the exception of the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>This slot features Stacked Wilds which cover the entire reel. It is possible for only the top or bottom of the Stacked Wild to be visible.</p>
<p>Landing 3 Scatter symbols triggers the Free Spins feature, starting with 8 free spins. Throughout the feature, more Wild symbols will land on the reels than during the base game.</p>
<p>Extra Wild symbol is chosen at random</p>
<p>One of the regular symbols is chosen at random to become a Wild symbol for the duration of the Free Spins feature. Additional symbols may gain Wild status during the Free Spins feature. Each time a symbol appears with a special Indicator, this progress is monitored in a tracker, and the symbol is closer to gaining Wild status.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Wild Streak is 96.05%, nearly exactly our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€10.00 per spin. This somewhat lower range may be less appealing to high rollers.</p>
<p>Wild Streak comes in with high volatility, making it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its average RTP and high volatility, we recommend this classic fruit machine slot.</p>
<p>Players who are dreaming of a night out at the casino will appreciate the vintage visuals offered by Wild Streak. Meanwhile, mathematically-inclined players will be drawn to the solid RTP and robust volatility.</p>
<p>The bonus features add further appeal to this fiery slot.</p>
