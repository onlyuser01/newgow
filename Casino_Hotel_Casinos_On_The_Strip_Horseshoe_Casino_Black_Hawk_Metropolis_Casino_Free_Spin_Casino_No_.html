<p>The Alfa Romeo F1 Team will be known as Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake following a new agreement with the influential online operator</p>
<p>The Formula One Alfa Romeo F1 Team has entered what it called a “record-breaking new title partnership” with Stake, one of the biggest online gambling websites in the world. Under the new agreement, Stake will create a new identity for the team, which will now be known as Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake.</p>
<p>The Motorsports Team Gains a New Identity</p>
<p>The Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake is but the latest major entity to join the Stake family. As a Stake partner, the team will join a long list of influential partners, which includes the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Everton FC, the soccer legend Sergio Aguero and the famous singer Drake, among others. The operator, as noted in the announcement, is bullish on cementing itself as one of the freshest gaming brands with one of the most comprehensive entertainment packages in the world.</p>
<p>According to the release, this multi-year agreement aims to improve Stake’s brand recognition and help its products reach more sports and sports betting enthusiasts. The operator will use the opportunity to participate in a variety of F1 activations alongside the Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake. More news about these plans will be announced before the next F1 season.</p>
<p>The investment in Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake further attests to Stake’s commitment to supporting professional sports. It is also the latest move toward building a flourishing community of fans of sports and motorsports. With Formula One being the pinnacle of motorsports, such an agreement was “inevitable,” the release stated.</p>
<p>The Agreement Is a Testament to the Popularity of Motorsports</p>
<p>Alessandro Alunni Bravi, managing director of Sauber Motorsports, which operates the Alfa Romeo F1 Team, and team representative, commented on the new agreement. He emphasized that he is delighted to welcome Stake as the new co-title partner of the team. Bravi is convinced that this agreement will open a new chapter for both parties.</p>
<p>Bravi added that Formula One continues to grow in popularity and the entry of major entertainment companies in the sector is a testament to that.</p>
<p>We are excited to join such a portfolio of sports and entertainment brands and we’re looking forward to the activation program that Stake will unveil for our fans. Alessandro Alunni Bravi, MD, Sauber Motorsports</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bijan Tehrani, co-founder of Stake, said that his team is absolutely thrilled to join forces with one of the most legendary teams in motorsports. He noted that both parties are ambitious to grow and succeed, making them like-minded partners.</p>
<p>Tehrani promised that Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake enthusiasts will not be disappointed by this partnership.</p>
<p>We are fully committed to enhancing race weekends by creating unique experiences for all Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake fans, growing audience engagement in the digital arena. Bijan Tehrani, co-founder, Stake</p>
<p>Stake continues to be one of the most influential gambling operators in the world. However, its ride has had its bumps as in September the operator came under legal fire in the United States.</p>
