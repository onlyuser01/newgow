<p>As for revenue from online wagering, official Colorado announced a total of $50.7 million. Out of it, $659,647 was connected to retail wagering in September. Soccer was also the most popular sport chosen by bettors for September, mostly as a result of the increased interest in the fresh National Football League season that was initiated at the beginning of the month. Accordingly, Colorado bettors chose to spend a grand total of $145.7 million in close to 7,500 wagers on professional soccer. Bets on college soccer reached the $52.7 million mark, while baseball bets totaled $83.2 million. At the same time, combination and parlay wagers gathered $75.3 million.</p>

At the end of September, the official Fiscal Year 2021-22 financial report issued by the Colorado Department of Revenue revealed impressive revenue for the state. The growth was a result of the different legislative initiatives that allowed operators to gain better control over their businesses.</p>
<p>Three years ago in November, voters in Colorado passed Proposition DD which turned Colorado into one of the US states that would enable people to make legal wagers on sporting events. This was possible as a result of the Supreme Court taking down the law banning sports betting in the majority of states. Together with the legislative bill issued by the Colorado General Assembly in the spring of 2019 and Proposition DD, the state’s Division of Gaming and Limited Gaming Control Commission turned into the statutory authority that would oversee regulation regarding sports betting. Colorado officially legalized and regulated sports betting on May 1, 2020.</p>
