<p>Stakelogic, one of the most prominent studios and developers of live dealer and online casino slots, has announced a new partnership in the Netherlands. The company, which has been strengthening its presence in the market over the past months, has now teamed up with 711, a prominent local operator, making its titles fully available with the brand.</p>
<p>This partnership will allow 711 to benefit from Stakelogic’s library of games, with the studio maintaining a dedicated development arm which is committed to building games that are specific to the tastes and preferences of Dutch players exclusively. As a result, Stakelogic has been able to bring some of the most popular and played titles in the market, and deservedly so.</p>
<p>711 will similarly have access to player-favorite titles that translate into better retention and engagement for brands, bringing along with them features such as Free Spins, Wilds, and Multipliers. Among the games that will now be available on 711.nl are Super Bonus Wild, Super 6 Timer, Mega Runner, Bonus Runner, Runner 8 Runner, and others.</p>
<p>Stakelogic will top this content with content from its live casino arm, Stakelogic Live, which is bringing some of the best experiences across blackjack, roulette, and gameshow-style games.</p>
<p>All of the supplier’s games are designed in a way that inspires engagement and an experience that rivals that of private VIP lounges in land-based venues. Stakelogic’s library further includes unique and proprietary features such as Spin to Win and Super Stake for even more worthwhile and rewarding experiences.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Stakelogic Commercial Director Jose Simon said that the company was excited at the opportunity to be strengthening its local market position with 711 by its side. Simon went even further and stated that there are few studios that truly understand the needs of local Dutch players and what they are looking for.</p>
<p>711 will be able to keep ahead of competitors thanks to the library of games Stakelogic will now provide, Simon noted. Stakelogic Live Head of Live Casino Richard Walker hailed the role of the live dealer products that will also be strengthening 711.nl’s offer. He described those as "next-generation" solutions that will further differentiate the brand in the highly-competitive market.</p>
<p>711 Chief Operating Officer Gilles De Backer was similarly pleased to see this partnership take shape and for Stakelogic and Stakelogic Live games to be arriving to strengthen the brand’s library. "This is a highly competitive market and one where player expectations are high. Content integrations like this with Stakelogic ensure that we deliver a superior experience to our players," De Backer concluded.</p>
