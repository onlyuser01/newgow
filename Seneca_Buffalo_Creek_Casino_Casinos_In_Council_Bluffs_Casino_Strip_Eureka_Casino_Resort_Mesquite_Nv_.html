    <h1>Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino Casinos In Council Bluffs Casino Strip Eureka Casino Resort Mesquite Nv</h1>

<p>DraftKings, a leading daily fantasy and sportsbook brand, continued to enrich its partnership with The PGA Tour after two tournaments of the professional golf organization announced sponsorship agreements with the gaming operator.</p>
<p>Expanding Presence in Golf</p>
<p>Under the agreements, DraftKings was named the first Betting Operator of the World Golf Championship-FedEx St.Jude Invitational that will take place August 2 till August 8 at TPC Southwind, as well as the first Official Betting Operator of THE NORTHERN TRUST scheduled from August 18 till August 22 at Liberty National Golf Club.</p>
<p>“DraftKings is proud to evolve and expand our presence into the golf space by continuing to build upon the existing relationship with the PGA TOUR. We look forward to providing fans an unapparelled experience at Liberty National and TPC Southwind.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>The partnership between DraftKings and The PGA Tour started back in July 2019 when the professional golf organization named the operator its Official Fantasy Game Partner. A year later, DraftKings became the first Official Betting Operator of The PGA Tour.</p>
<p>“…With the existing relationship between DraftKings and the PGA TOUR, integrating them into the Memphis market at the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational was an easy decision. We’re excited to be one of the first PGA TOUR events to offer a public venue setting in this category.” Darrell Smith, Executive Director, WGC-FedEx St.Jude Invitational</p>
<p>In April this year, the Boston-based gaming brand and The PGA Tour entered into a market access deal in Arizona to operate a retail sportsbook at TPC Scottdale and offer mobile sports betting in the state. Currently, the state is considering licensing requirements for sportsbook operators, ahead of the planned September 9 official launch of the market.</p>
<p>‘DraftKings House’ Hospitality Suites</p>
<p>DraftKings, which expanded its presence in golf after a sponsorship deal with Bryson DeChambeau in 2020, will be able to offer hospitality suites under both agreements with the tournaments.</p>
<p>Called “DraftKings House”, the hospitality suites will be allocated beside the 18th green at World Golf Championship-FedEx St. Jude Invitational, offering unbeatable views from the open-air patio. At THE NORTHERN TRUST, the allocation will be between the 15th green and 16th fairway and will include a VIP suite for private hospitality.</p>
<p>“… Our tournament prides itself in having on-site experiences that cater to a variety of fans and we’re looking forward to debuting this innovative venue on one of the biggest stages in golf as the FedExCup Playoffs commence.“ Julie Tyson, Executive Director, THE NORTHERN TRUST</p>
<p>Both locations will feature an open space to the public, where DraftKings will provide fans with access to TV broadcasts of golf and other live sports events, complimentary Wi-Fi network and phone chargers, as well as a variety of food and beverage options.</p>
<p>THE NORTHERN TRUST will mark the first time in which DraftKings will host its Fantasy Golf World Championship, offering a prize pool of $4 million for the event which will take place in person during the 4 days of the tournament and will see 40 of the top daily fantasy performers compete for the $1 million first prize.</p>
