    <h1>Riverside Casino And Golf Resort Iowa City 7 Seas Casino World Treasure Bay Casino Biloxi Mississipp</h1>

<p>I'm not 100% sure about that, but a lot of weird stuff happen in the tables and the betting, malfunctions that almost never benefit the player, I have video of these table malfunctions, one I remember really well was on table C on regular Evolution baccarat, where on the betting grid (where you place your chips, where you see the scanned cards) was showing some cards but the cards on the table were different ones, never again I played on that table. Other thing that happens regularly is getting your bets rejected, and most of the times it was a winning bet, like my most recent case: 350 euros bet on banker, bet rejected and banker did hit, that is the thing that sometimes makes me wanna quit gambling, when you ask support about it they open a case but absolutely nothing is done, I have never been paid potential winnings on rejected bets, and the shady part is that rejected bets most of the time (in my case) would have been winning ones. I used to play baccarat a lot on Playtech and that never happened to me, sadly the casino I play doesn't offer Playtech.</p>
