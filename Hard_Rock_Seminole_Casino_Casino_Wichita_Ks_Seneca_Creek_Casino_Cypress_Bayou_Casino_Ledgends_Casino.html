<p>Business-to-Business iGaming platform provider EveryMatrix has sealed a new deal with KingMakers, the Pan-African entertainment and sports betting digital platform from Nigeria that is currently traded as BetKing. According to the terms of the new three-year contract, BetKing will be responsible for integrating EveryMatrix’s CasinoEngine platform dedicated to the iGaming sector. This will be possible via BonusEngine and JackpotEngine. Nigerian players will get the chance to enjoy more quality content through a more flexible series of customization solutions and additional rewards.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Continues Its Expansion in Nigeria</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s chief executive officer of CasinoEngine Stian Enger spoke about the new deal with KingMakers, explaining it was part of their “ongoing mission” to grow their reach and penetrate the Nigerian region. Enger called KingMakers “one of the biggest players in the Nigerian market,” further emphasizing the importance of the new agreement.</p>
<p>At the same time, KingMakers’ head of gaming Lauren Holder expressed the company’s delight to sign a partnership with “such a respected and successful business like EveryMatrix” with the purpose of fueling Nigerian clients with “a plethora of content.” Holder added that the three-year contract was expected to bring“exciting and engaging games” to customers while continuing to strengthen the power of their brand “where Africa Plays.”</p>
<p>KingMakers, Committed to Healthy Gambling Practices</p>
<p>At the end of May, BetKing, KingMakers Group’s subsidiary, expressed its commitment to promoting healthy gambling practices. The operator joined hands with the International Betting Integrity Association in its fight against fraud in the sports betting industry, with an emphasis on curbing match-fixing and ensuring a legal and secure betting experience for all customers.</p>
<p>At the moment, KingMakers provides licensed brick-and-mortar and online products to customers via the BetKing brand in countries like Ghana, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. The company also provides sports betting markets tied to hockey, soccer, cricket, basketball, and tennis together with custom-made virtual games such as Color-Color and Kings’ League. BetKing Nigeria is currently operated by SV Gaming Limited and counts more than 200 staff members working at the head office in Lagos.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix has over 700 employees spread across ten countries who are catering to the needs of more than 150 global customers with iGaming solutions, services, software, and content. The list includes the US market that EveryMatrix entered at the end of October when it introduced its content to BetMGM customers in New Jersey. The provider agreed to distribute its content straight from its state-of-the-art in-house gaming studios on BetMGM’s platform located in New Jersey.</p>
