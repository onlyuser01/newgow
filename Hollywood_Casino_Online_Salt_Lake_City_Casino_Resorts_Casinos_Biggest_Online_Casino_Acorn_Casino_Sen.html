<p>Another senate bill appears in Mississippi seeking to legalize mobile online sports betting. The bill’s sponsor, Senator Philip Moran, believes this is the future for the state’s betting industry.</p>
<p>Time to Modernize Mississippi’s Sports Betting, Says Senator</p>
<p>Mississippi is making a determined step forward to try and again legalize mobile sports betting in the state after Senator Philip Moran submitted a bill briefly outlining a plan to legalize the activity in the state, amid steady betting results for the state.</p>
<p>In short, SB 2732 seeks to legalize mobile betting in the state with the state looking up north to Tennessee which has already launched its sports betting market. The proposal comes only a few days after Senator Scott DeLane pitched a bill that wants to bring online sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>Moran’s bill would allow state residents to use their handheld devices or a desktop device to connect to a sportsbook and place a wager without being physically present in an establishment. In the proposed legislation, Moran briefly explains that so far, 15 states have legalized the activity, allowing millions of Americans to places bets remotely.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, Mississippi law does not authorize online sports betting, but this bill seeks to change that. Mississippi has been leaving money on the table by not authorizing online sports wagering, and it is time to modernize Mississippi’s gambling offerings and do what’s best for Mississippians.”</p>
<p>Still Room for Growth in MS Betting</p>
<p>Moran is using momentum from the legalization of retail sports betting that has made it possible for casinos to offer in-person wagers. Sports betting began in August 2018, after the Mississippi Gaming Commission established a framework allowing stakeholders to progress with setting up sports betting facilities.</p>
<p>Despite its fairly small size, Mississippi hosts 31 casinos and numerous sportsbook license holders, including William Hill, Caesars, BetAmerica, and DraftKings, among others. A previous attempt to legalize sports betting in the state was made by Cedric Burnett who filed HB 172 in January 2020, but the bill failed to pass through.</p>
<p>Like Burnett’s, Moran offers progressive taxation on gross revenue, ranging from 4% to 8% depending on the sportsbook’s results for the month. Lawmakers feel this is fair, given how many stakeholders there are so no single entity would be overburdened with tax.</p>
