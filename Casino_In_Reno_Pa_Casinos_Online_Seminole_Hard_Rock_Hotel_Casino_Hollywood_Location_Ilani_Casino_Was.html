<p>Top provider of complete turnkey Business to Business (B2B) iGaming solutions Gamingtec has decided to sign off a deal with prestigious slot creator Red Tiger. As a result of the new partnership, Gamingtec will expand its already impressive gaming library with the full suite of iconic Red Tiger games.</p>
<p>Red Tiger Partnership, One Further Step Toward Expansion</p>
<p>Launched in 2013 from its London-based offices, Gamingtec’s main goal is to become the leading B2B supplier on the iGaming market by providing enhanced technology and state-of-the-art services. To implement this strategy, Gamingtec has been actively seeking important partnerships that would help them launch top-tier brands worldwide. The new Red Tiger partnership falls into line with these continuous expansion plans that also include ongoing improvement of all products.</p>
<p>At the moment, Gamingtec offers more than ten themed front ends and a rich portfolio of games consisting of more than 10,000 titles from reputable providers like NetEnt, Evolution, Quickspin, Pragmatic Play, or Big Time Gaming. By adding Red Tiger to the list, Gamingtec hopes to attract and retain even more clients in the near future.</p>
<p>Gamingtec representative Sapar Karyagdyyev stated the company considers the popular in-demand Red Tiger provider one of the most important actors in the industry, which would make adding their games to the Gamingtec portfolio an “imperative” action for their growth.</p>
<p>As a result of the milestone deal, all casino operators powered by Gamingtec will provide their players with 190 new hit games from Red Tiger, including popular titles like Primate King, Gonzo’s Quest Megaways, or Mystery Reels Megaways. Red Tiger games are known worldwide for their highly entertaining gameplay, crisp designs, and original sounds.</p>
<p>Innovation, Ambition, and Teamwork</p>
<p>As one of the fastest-growing gambling companies on the planet, Gamingtec currently counts more than 100 talented and experienced employees subject to continuous learning and risk-taking exercises. Around 80 team members work in the Kyiv office, the company’s first development office to open after the London-based one.</p>
<p>All Gamingtec employees are top coders, managers, game designers, or international law experts. The company provides fully customizable front-end designs via their B2B solutions encompassing sports betting and casino games, along with a highly secure platform.</p>
<p>Gamingtec primarily focuses on constantly innovating its products and services while keeping things simple and original. With an ambitious strategy aimed at “winning big by solving small tasks best”, the B2B iGaming supplier is known for its advanced mechanics, special features, and spectacular tools provided to all operators. As a result of a recent deal signed with ZingBrain, Gamingtec can now recommend its best content to players while relying on their personal preferences and recorded gaming habits. ZingBrain is an Artificial Intelligence engine that offers integrated performance improvement platforms for casinos and sportsbooks.</p>
