<p>Rainer Kempe becomes GreySnow Poker ambassador</p>
<p>GreySnow overcomes legal hurdles and is operating at full blast</p>
<p>The platform’s global ambitions haven’t subsided</p>
<p>Rainer Kempe has signed up as GreySnow Poker’s new ambassador. Kempe recently won a high-roller Monte Carlo event and is worth $20 million in lifetime winnings.</p>
<p>Iowa Tribe Adds Rainer Kempe for GreySnow Ambassador</p>
<p>The Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma has added a new representative in the face of high-roller poker player Rainer Kempe. Kempe is among the first poker ambassadors for the newly launched website, GreySnow Poker, which has been expanding onto other verticals, including casino games and sports betting.</p>
<p>GreySnow has known a few challenges ahead of its launch back in its day. The website was first known as PokerTibe.com and the tribes planned to launch operations in 2015, but that was met with firm opposition from Oklahoma, which had the state’s Gambling Compliance Unit bar the launch of the website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Universal Entertainment Group software that was supposed to be used on the website experienced delays in development which led to more complications for the website.</p>
<p>The arrival of CEO Fred Khalilian didn’t help one iota, and in 2018, the tribe decided to scrap its plans and just come up with a new identity for its portal.</p>

<p>With a fresh start, the website managed to hit the launch pad in November, 2018 and went live exactly as planned, without any unnecessary complications to impede it.</p>
<p>GreySnow was born to serve not only audiences in the U.S. but also globally, hoping to maintain a reputation for a technologically-advanced card room.</p>
<p>Kempe, A New Man to Spread the Word</p>
<p>Kempe’s arrival to the platform comes at a good moment as well. Earlier this year, GreySnow Poker announced the addition of Kempe who recently topped a €25,000 buy-in tournament in Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>So far in 2019, Kempe has earned over €2.5 million which puts him a big name on the global poker scene. Besides, Kempe has already earned estimated $20 million in his short career as a high-roller player.</p>
<p>“I’m very excited to announce that as of today I’ll be partnering with GreySnow Poker. After meeting with the Chairman of the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma and other esteemed representatives of the Tribe I’m feeling incredibly honoured by the trust they put in me”</p>
<p>Kempe has lauded GreySnow Poker as a project that promises to benefit not only U.S. players, but the “whole poker community.” He spoke as part of the team, explaining that GreySnow Poker already offered 30% overlays.</p>
<p>This is in line with the stated goal of the website, which claims that it seeks to create an experience marked by integrity. GreySnow didn’t pass up on an opportunity to comment on the newly-formed partnership:</p>
<p>“This brings the most promising tournament player in the world right now together with the promise of GreySnow Poker’s player-first philosophy and the Iowa Tribe’s commitment to outstanding community impact and generous rewards. “</p>
<p>With GreySnow out of the regulatory woods, the platform continues to operate at full blast and position itself as a global leader among online card rooms.</p>
