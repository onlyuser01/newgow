<p>EveryMatrix has expanded its SlotMatrix RGS portfolio with the addition of a new studio, Spinberry. Spinberry steps in as an exclusive partner for the solution and adds many engaging and customer-focused games that will boost engagement for any partner operator that launches with the products.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix is a powerful aggregation platform that offers content from some of the best studios and provides one of the largest selections of online casino content. Spinberry brings engaging titles and unique mechanics, including Feature Spin, which lets players trigger various game features. Operators may further choose from different Return-to-Player (RTP) settings and adjust betting limits to give their audiences the best experience.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Head of Operations RGS Games Ashley Bloor welcomed the opportunity to see Spinberry as the latest developer to join the platform and use it to reach new audiences. EveryMatrix is similarly going to benefit as it secures another trusted and enjoyable supplier and its products.</p>
<p>"Weâ€™re delighted to have them on board and look forward to working closely with them," Bloor explained. Spinberry Managing Director Stuart Pounder was of a similar mind that EveryMatrix makes for an important partner that allows the studios to significantly expand on its distribution channels and reach new players.</p>
<p>"We are naturally excited to see what this brings in the future," Pounder noted. SlotMatrix RGS previously partnered up with Rogue and added the studio and its products to the library of games. The company has been busy with its iGaming plans and ambitions, as confirmed by EveryMatrix President of Americas Erik Nyman in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Aggregating content has been a powerful distribution channel for companies with the SlotMatrix RGS proving powerful and meaningful solutions for studios looking to considerably scale their reach with leading operators and expand with new audiences.</p>
<p>Spinberry is an author of a ton of slot games, including popular releases such as Revved Wilds, Spinberry Wilds, Drop the Wilds, Circus Riches, and more. The up-and-coming studio has been featured at dozens of prominent operators around the world with the company now in a position to dramatically scale its offer.</p>
