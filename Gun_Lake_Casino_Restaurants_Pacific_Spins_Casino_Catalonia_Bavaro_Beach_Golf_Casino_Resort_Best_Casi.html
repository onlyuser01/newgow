<p>Eugene “Geno” DelGiudice, a member of an illegal gambling ring in Chicago was sentenced to one-year probation. In the first three months of the sentence, the man will be under home detention. Appearing in front of U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall, Mr. DelGiudice apologized for the wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Prosecutors Charge 10 People Involved in a Gambling Ring</p>
<p>An 85-year-old man involved in a sports gambling ring in Chicago received a sentence of three months of home detention as a part of 1-year probation. Back in July, Eugene “Geno” DelGiudice pleaded guilty to conspiring to conduct an illegal gambling business. He became the first member to be convicted out of 10 people involved in the illegal gambling business. Looking back in February, a total of 10 people were charged over illegal gambling activities. Besides Eugene “Geno” DelGiudice, his son, Vincent “Uncle Mick” DelGiudice was also charged. Although Vincent DelGiudice pleaded not guilty, he may change his plea to guilty next week.</p>
<p>Additional members of the gambling ring, also charged are Justin Hines of Algonquin, Nicholas Stella of Chicago, Matthew Namoff of Midlothian, Vasilios Prassas of Chicago, Matthew “Sweaters” Knight of Mokena, Keith D. Benson of Lemont, and Todd Blanken of Cary. Furthermore, the prosecution led to the indictment and charging of the mayor of north suburban Mettawa, Casey Urlacher who allegedly was also part of the gambling ring.</p>
<p>One Year Sentence of Probation</p>
<p>Appearing before U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall in a video conference on Monday, Eugene DelGiudice received a one year sentence of probation. With that in mind, for the first three months of the sentence, Mr. DelGiudice must stay at home. Judge Kendall did acknowledge that Mr. DelGiudice has led a “largely law-abiding life” besides his gambling offense back in 1996.</p>
<p>“I know what I did was wrong and I’m sorry. I don’t have an excuse, so I ain’t gonna make any,” said Eugene DelGiudice in front of U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall</p>
<p>The defendant’s attorney David Petrich said in court that his client wasn’t aware of “the mechanics” of the organization. Petrich also stressed that Mr. DelGiudice has not threatened any of the gamblers, nor was able to use a computer at that time.</p>
<p>The Threats of the Illegal Gambling Ring</p>
<p>According to the investigation, Eugene DelGiudice had the role of a “runner” in the gambling ring. Mr. DelGiudice was collecting and delivering big amounts of money upon request from his son. Furthermore, the man also received money as tips, the investigation said. The prosecutors also stressed that millions were generated by the illegal operation annually and that many people were impacted as the ring “preyed on vulnerable individuals, many of whom were hopelessly addicted to gambling.”</p>
<p>“The government has met with victims whose careers, marriages, family life, and lives were jeopardized and harmed by their affiliation with the gambling enterprise,” wrote the Assistant U.S. Attorney Ankur Srivastava</p>
<p>An example which Assistant U.S. Attorney Ankur Srivastava gave was about a gambler who was in debt of the gambling ring. The person was threatened by “agents” of the ring. On one occasion, the gambler in debt was threatened with physical harm, while at some point when his wife was ill, the “agent” of the ring threatened to expose the gambler’s habit, wrote Srivastava. All the threats were aiming at making the gambler repay his debt to the gambling ring.</p>
