<p>Kambi Group, a renowned B2B provider of sports betting services, has joined forces with Ondiss, a Buenos Aires-based developer of online gaming platforms. The former company agreed to provide certain Argentine operators with sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>Kambi to Power Argentine Brands</p>
<p>As per the deal, Ondiss will allow Kambi to expand its LATAM footprint and power three Argentine operators with its critically-acclaimed sportsbook. The three companies that will benefit from the provider’s sports betting solutions are BetWarrior, Casino Club and Casino Magic. It is possible that more companies within the Ondiss network will be added to this list in the future. This, in turn, could increase Kambi’s presence to up to 10 Argentine provinces.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, Kambi is sure to gain a foothold in some of Argentina’s most-populated provinces. In addition, Kambi will be able to expand its overall LATAM presence. The region is very important to the company because of the local market’s fast growth.</p>
<p>This deal will not be Kambi’s first step in the Argentine market. On the contrary, the provider has had a presence in the country for some time now and already knows some of the brands it will now be powering. Neuquén province’s Casino Magic, for example, first partnered with the B2B company in early 2021. Several months later, Kambi teamed up with BetWarrior, launching its solutions in Buenos Aires City and the Buenos Aires province.</p>
<p>Casino Club, on the other hand, is a company that will be partnering with Kambi for the first time. The operator has a presence in several regions in Argentina and will help the provider further expand its footprint. Additionally, Casino Club plans to leverage its new partnership with Kambi and launch a sportsbook in Misiones province in the following months.</p>
<p>Kambi Is Looking Forward to Expanding in LATAM</p>
<p>Kambi Group’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Kristian Nylén, is thrilled to expand his company’s footprint in Latin America. He said that the local market is very promising for his company. Because of that, he is happy to sign an agreement with Ondiss and help the brands comprising its network.</p>
<p>Nylén mentioned that BetWarrior and Casino Magic have already proven to be great partners. He said that it will be an honor to continue working with them. In addition, Nylén is excited about getting to know Casino Club and helping it build on its already strong market position.</p>
<p>BetWarrior’s chief marketing officer, Santiago Gándara, also shared his thoughts. He said he is with the opportunity to deepen his relationship with Kambi Group – a company that has supported the operator since its launch. Gándara vowed to continue reinforcing his company’s leadership in Argentina and promote Kambi’s solutions.</p>
