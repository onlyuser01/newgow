<p>EPIC Risk Management, a company that specializes in tackling gambling addiction through lived experiences, has revealed a new white paper that is designed to help the industry help those most vulnerable and for stakeholders to better understand gambling-related harm and integrity issues in sports and esports, EPIC said on its official website.</p>
<p>This new white paper, Gambling Harm Prevention in Sport Review, has been drafted with the help of a range of experts from within the company and partners from the gambling, sports, and esports industries. EPIC introduced the white paper during the Gambling Harm Prevention in Sport Summit last week with the help of UCFBâ€™s Global Institute of Sport.</p>
<p>The event itself reunited more than 100 executives and welfare professionals from both the world of sports and esports. The latest white paper is the result of the efforts put in by the EPIC Risk Management Pro Sport Advisory Board, which is a collective from various industries who have weighed in on the report to ensure that players, staff, match officials, coaches and other people involved in competitive events are shielded from gambling harm.</p>
<p>Commenting on the event, EPIC Risk Management Director of Sports Partnerships Ben McGregor hailed the white paper and explained that it was the result of a "year of key discussions" which involved well-informed individuals and institutions that were determined to help eliminate potential gambling harm and risks from their respective sectors.</p>
<p>"This white paper has been compiled by leading practitioners in player care and welfare from the world of professional sport and esports, as well as those with an intricate knowledge of the gambling industry and sporting integrity, so between them, their recommendations carry a lot of experienced credibility," McGregor noted.</p>
<p>Yet, this is not the end of the road. The Pro Sport Advisory Board which put together the white paper will now focus on broadening its expertise by adding new professionals and expanding its knowledge base as well as the markets and competitions it covers. The goal is to continue adapting best practices and receive more input and advice so that more people involved with sports, gambling and esports are protected.</p>
<p>The white paper was developed with the input of stakeholders and also through the guidance of experts such as Steve Emberson, Head of Integrity Intelligence and Education at Genius Sports. EPIC has been actively involved with improving responsible gambling standards in the industry across the board.</p>
