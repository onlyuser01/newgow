<p>A 27-year-old Pennsylvania man is facing extradition to New Jersey to face a murder charge after following the victim from a casino to his home some 50 miles away. Jekai Reid-John of Norristown allegedly tailed the man from Pennsylvania’s Parx Casino to Plainsboro, N.J. where he was shot and later died.</p>

<p>Early on Tuesday, Reid-John wounded Sree Aravapalli, 54, during the robbery, according to police. It is unclear how much, if any, of the approximately $10,000 won at the casino was stolen from Aravapalli.</p>
<p>Just hours before the shooting, Reid-John allegedly watched Aravapalli leave the Bensalem, Pa. gaming property with the night’s winnings. Reid-John followed Aravapalli until the victim eventually stopped at his house.</p>
<p>Reid-John allegedly followed him and entered the residence via a sliding door. Aravapalli was downstairs when several shots were fired and he suffered “multiple gunshot wounds,” prosecutors said in a statement. A car sped off after the gunfire, a neighbor told police. Aravapalli was rushed by ambulance to a local hospital. Soon after arriving, he was declared dead.</p>
<p>Aravapalli reportedly worked for a pharmaceutical company. He was the father of two children. Aravapalli’s wife and teenage daughter were sleeping upstairs in the house when the shooting took place, reports said.</p>
<p>Reid-John was charged on Wednesday with first-degree murder. More charges are possible, according to local media reports. He was being held in Pennsylvania’s Montgomery County jail late this week.</p>
<p>Word of Warning</p>
<p>A mourner at Aravapalli’s funeral had words of caution given the tragic events.</p>
<p>“In the daytime, you can at least figure out that somebody is following you. But at night, no, never,” Vivek Taneja told WNBC, a New York TV station.</p>
<p>I’ve been to Vegas, Atlantic City, but no, I never thought that somebody would follow me,” Taneja said. “I think I need to be watchful all the time, not just at casinos.”</p>
<p>Following the shooting, Plainsboro Police Chief Frederick Tavener said in a statement, “I want to offer my sincerest condolences to the Aravapalli family for their tragic loss. This is an unexpected and alarming event for their family, friends, and our entire community.”</p>
<p>Casino.org reached out to the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office for more details. Assistant Prosecutor Conner J.E. Ouellette said the ongoing investigation required limited public comment.</p>
<p>Recent Pennsylvania Homicide</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a 30-year-old man allegedly fatally knifed a Bethlehem, Pa. man. The victim, Elson Aviles, 35, was driving back from the Wind Creek Bethlehem casino and was seriously wounded by the passenger, police revealed.</p>
<p>Aviles was taken to a local hospital for treatment. But he died a short time later after surgery, according to Lehighvalleylive.com, a regional news site.</p>
<p>Shortly after the attack, Jose Luis Leon was charged with criminal homicide.</p>
