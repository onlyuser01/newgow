<p>Vietnam Deports 35 Chinese Nationals For Running Online Gambling Ring</p>

<p>Police in Vietnam’s third-largest city of Da Nang broke up an illegal online gambling ring late last week, resulting in the deportation of 35 Chinese nationals. Among the deportees were four women.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, authorities in Da Nang raided six properties after receiving tips, where they also arrested unspecified numbers of Vietnamese workers implicated in the online bust.</p>
<p>Trying to Fly Under the Radar</p>
<p>Members of the Chinese group confirmed to local authorities that they are part of a broader organization which they declined to identify. The arrestees told Vietnamese law enforcement that they’d been instructed to build an online gambling ring in the Southeast Asian nation, with the goal of avoiding detection by Chinese police and regulators.</p>
<p>Apparently the alleged culprits failed at that mission, as Da Nang police delivered the Chinese citizens to their counterparts at the Mong Cai border over the weekend. North Vietnam shares a border with China.</p>
<p>Pattern of Arrests</p>
<p>The deportation comes less than two weeks after police in Vietnam’s Thanh Hoa province disrupted an illicit online gambling group there as well. Nine arrests were made as the result of that crackdown.</p>
<p>The Thanh Hoa consortium was sophisticated in that its patrons used cash to buy virtual money for use at its web-based casinos. Media reports say the Thanh Hoa operation had transactions of $170 million and that authorities there froze $256,000 from suspects’ bank accounts of those believed to be involved in the group.</p>
<p>In April, Vietnamese police raided another illegal online gambling group that reportedly generated revenue of $1 billion, resulting in 22 arrests.</p>
