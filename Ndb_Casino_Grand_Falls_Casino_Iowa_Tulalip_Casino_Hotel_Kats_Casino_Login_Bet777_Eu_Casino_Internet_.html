<p>iGaming Hosting Provider Internet Vikings made the management shift on 1 July 2022 when Rickard Vikström assumed the position of chief executive officer. He replaces the company’s former CEO, Peter Ekmark, who will keep his place on the board of directors.</p>
<p>The New CEO Made Promises for Sustained Growth and Future Success</p>
<p>Vikström has been with Internet Vikings since the company’s inception and is one of its key founding members. He has over 20 years of industry experience and has spearheaded several other successful IT companies like domain marketplace Snapback and business information portal Foretag.se. Vikström has also been a board member of web security providers Stay Secure and Holm Security and mobile app developer Aplexa.</p>
<p>“I look forward to this exciting journey leading to new achievements,” Vikström commented on his promotion. He noted that Internet Vikings has enjoyed rapid growth and is among the leaders in the B2B sector. The new CEO thanked his predecessor and stated his commitment to keeping the company on the course toward future successes.</p>
<p>Peter Ekmark, who is stepping down from the leading position after a three-year tenure, also reacted positively to the shift in management. “I am convinced that I could not be leaving the company in more capable hands,” Ekmark noted, lauding Vikström’s skills. The former head of Internet Vikings also expressed his hopes for the company’s future growth and potential to rise to the top.</p>
<p>The Company Has Won Several Awards amidst Its US Expansion</p>
<p>Internet Vikings is a privately held B2B iGaming Hosting Provider. The Stockholm-based company was founded in 2008 and provides various hosting services, colocation, servers, and IP addresses. The company has kept expanding its portfolio of products and is currently a leader in its field. Its efforts got acknowledged during the Global Gaming Awards, where Internet Vikings received the Services Provider of the Year award, and the 2022 SiGMA Americas Awards, where the company was named Services Provider of the Year.</p>
<p>The company currently operates across five continents. Its current central focus is the US iGaming market, where Internet Vikings has clients in nearly every state with regulated online gambling and sports betting. The B2B provider’s US expansion efforts have reached a record pace in 2022. In January, the company expanded in Illinois, followed by Michigan in February and Indiana in May. It is now up to Rickard Vikström to ensure that Internet Vikings retains its momentum and continues its upward trajectory.</p>
