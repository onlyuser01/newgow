<p>The United States Open Championship a.k.a. the U.S. Open – the toughest major in the golf universe is back! Thursday, June 16 is when the first tee shots will be made at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts. Over the next four days, the world’s elite golfers will compete for the main prize of $2,250,000.</p>
<p>The U.S. Open is true to its name – it’s open to any golfer with a handicap of 1.4 or better. The result is that the USGA has accepted a total of 9,265 players from all 50 states, as well as from 79 other countries.</p>
<p>Among those are some real legends of the sport, like Rory McIlroy, Justin Tomas, Jon Rahm, and others. The big question is who will win the 2022 U.S. Open? That’s what we’ll try to answer in this post, so keep on reading!</p>

<p>U.S. Open Betting Favorites</p>
<p>Judging by the betting odds, Rory McIlroy is the #1 favorite, the man who won the tournament 11 years ago. The second favorite is Justin Thomas, who still has no U.S. Open wins in his portfolio.</p>
<p>Just behind him is Jon Rahm, the winner of the previous edition of the U.S. Open, as well as Scottie Scheffler, who’s currently the highest-ranked golfer in the world.</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we saw McIlroy win a major the last time. In fact, the last time it happened was in 2014. Has the time come for the Northern Irishman to end his drought?</p>
<p>Oddsmakers sure think so, probably because he’s been playing pretty decent golf as of lately. McIlroy is coming off a win at the 2022 RBC Canadian Open.</p>
<p>Justin Thomas</p>
<p>The winner of the 2022 PGA Championship is second on the list of U.S. Open favorites. Thomas definitely has the skills, as well as the motivation to do well in this tournament. The 2022 event is going to be his eighth U.S. Open, with his best result being T8 two years ago.</p>
<p>Jon Rahm</p>
<p>The reigning champion of the U.S. Open just needs to be considered one of the top favorites. He’s an elite player, who didn’t do much since the last year’s tournament, but who surely has the motivation to improve his 2022 record.</p>
<p>Scottie Scheffler</p>
<p>Knowing that he’s topping the 2022 Official World Golf Rankings is good enough of a reason to think of Scheffler as a candidate for the trophy. The American has been superb since the start of the year, already winning three big events – Phoenix Open, Arnold Palmer, and The Masters.</p>
<p>2022 U.S. Open Prediction</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy is probably the best golfer of his generation and although he hasn’t won a major since 2011, he definitely has what it takes to add another trophy to his collection. If he fails, one of the other three top favorites should win the U.S. Open – Thomas, Rahm, or Scheffler.</p>
<p>Pick: Rory McIlroy</p>
