    <h1>All Star Casino Spokane Tribe Casino Silver Reef Casino Real Casino Slots Enchanted Casino Betpanda</h1>

<p>I am writing to express my deep concern and frustration regarding the handling of my request to close my BetPanda account and my ongoing ability to gamble despite my clear declaration of being an addicted gambler.</p>
<p>(When i sent an official complaint, they immediately closed the account within the minute, but has not responded)</p>
<p>On October 2nd, I initially contacted support@betpanda.io and accounts@betpanda.io to request the closure of my account. To my surprise, I was informed that the closure of accounts is only possible for those that have remained inactive for a whole calendar month. This is rather perplexing, considering that Section 9 of your terms and conditions explicitly outlines the existence of a responsible gaming policy.</p>
<p>I subsequently reached out to their support team on October 8th (Second time) to reiterate my request for account closure. Unfortunately, despite my pleas and admissions of being addicted to gambling, no action has been taken, and I have continued to be able to deposit and gamble on the platform.</p>
<p>I am fully aware that your responsible gaming policy states that transactions and deposits made prior to a complaint are not eligible for refund, which I wholeheartedly agree with. However, since making my request, I have made multiple deposits and placed bets, which I believe is unfair to me as a gambling addict. The responsible gaming policy should be enforced promptly to protect individuals like me from the harm of addiction.</p>
<p>I kindly request the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Immediate closure of my BetPanda account as per the responsible gaming policy and as I initially requested on October 2nd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A thorough review of my recent deposits and bets made after my request for account closure, with the aim of issuing a refund for these transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is only fair to the casino to exclude any transactions before their acknowledgement on the 8th of october, because we can't presume the casino knew about my addiction before their email of denying closure. Then this regards all transactions made between the 08.10.2023 (October) to days date.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I urge you to consider the seriousness of my situation and the responsibility that BetPanda has towards ensuring a safe and responsible gaming environment. I believe that taking swift action in response to my request is not only the right thing to do but also in line with your stated responsible gaming policy.</p>
<p>I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.</p>
