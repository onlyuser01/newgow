<p>The first college football games of the 2019 season are still three months away from kicking off. However, the Westgate SuperBook has released updated odds this week on who will take home the national championship.</p>

<p>Here’s a hint: the two schools who have faced each other in three of the last four College Football Playoff title games are favored to meet again in January.</p>
<p>Defending national champion Clemson and runner-up Alabama are both 9-4 to win the title, according to the SuperBook. Both schools have won two of the last four titles each.</p>
<p>Clemson returns eight starters from last year’s high-powered offense, led by rising sophomore Trevor Lawrence. The quarterback led the Tigers with 3,280 passing yards and threw for 30 touchdowns. However, the Tigers must replace all four defensive linemen from last year’s stout defense</p>
<p>Alabama returns six starters on offense, including standout quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, and seven on defense. However, the Crimson Tide will once again churn through assistant coaches as Nick Saban will look to Steve Sarkisian to be the offensive coordinator. He’ll be Bama’s fourth different coordinator in as many years.</p>
<p>How confident is the SuperBook about Clemson or Alabama winning the title? It’s offering a prop bet where you can take both schools or the remaining 128 Football Bowl Subdivision programs. Alabama and Clemson have odds of -160, meaning a $160 bet would win $100. The field is +140, or 7-5.</p>
<p>The 2019 championship will take place in January at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans in January.</p>
<p>Other Teams</p>
<p>Only one other school, Georgia, has single-digit odds. The SuperBook listed the Bulldogs at 12-1 at the end of last season, but now they’re 6-1 to win the title. Georgia will likely be Alabama biggest threat in the Southeastern Conference, and it’s possible both schools may make it to the playoff.</p>
<p>Three other schools have odds under 20-1. They are 12-1 Ohio State, which will be led by former Georgia quarterback Justin Fields, 14-1 Michigan, and 14-1 Oklahoma, which features former Alabama quarterback Jalen Hurts.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest movers on the SuperBook board were SEC schools. Louisiana State dropped from 50-1 to 20-1, while Auburn went from 50-1 to 25-1. Both will face Alabama during the regular season.</p>
<p>Other Sportsbooks Odds</p>
<p>FanDuel, which runs sportsbooks in New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, currently lists Alabama as its futures favorite at +175. Clemson is FanDuel’s second choice at +220. They’re followed by Georgia (+800), Ohio State (+1200), Oklahoma (+1600), and Michigan (+1700).</p>
<p>PointsBet has Clemson and Alabama as +175 co-favorites, but the New Jersey online sportsbook offers Ohio State as the third choice at +700, with Georgia at +800. Oklahoma and Michigan are +1200 and +1600 respectively.</p>
<p>Both books also list futures betting for the Heisman Trophy, which goes to the most outstanding college football player of the season. Not surprisingly, Alabama and Clemson players are favored there, too. PointsBet has Lawrence as the favorite at +200, with Tagovailoa at +250. FanDuel has both as +250 co-favorites.</p>
<p>Hurts is the third choice at both, netting +1100 odds at FanDuel and +1200 at PointsBet. Should he win, he’d be the third straight Oklahoma quarterback to win the coveted award.</p>
