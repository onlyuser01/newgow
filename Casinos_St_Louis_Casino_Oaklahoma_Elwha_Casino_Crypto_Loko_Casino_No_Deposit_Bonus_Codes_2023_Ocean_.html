<p>The leading provider of mobile-focused games for the gambling vertical, Gaming Realms, announced a new deal, allowing the company to expand its presence in a strategic European market. On Friday, the company confirmed it joined forces with the leading land-based and online gambling operator in Spain, Golden Park.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, the provider of engaging content agreed to supply the brand with its leading games. As a result, Gaming Realms' titles such as Slingo Starburst, Slingo Reel King, Slingo Sweet Bonanza and Slingo Da Vinci Diamonds are now available for GoldenPark customers, expanding further its offering.</p>
<p>Andrés García, GoldenPark's Director of Operations, shared his excitement about the recent collaboration in a statement. He pointed out: "Having a diversified offering is key to standing out in a crowded marketplace." Finally, García explained: "By offering our players Gaming Realms’ unique portfolio we add a new level of entertainment to our online casino that will strengthen our proposition and attract a new audience."</p>
<p>Mariachiara Lagravinese, Gaming Realms' Regional Account Manager, was similarly excited about the fresh partnership signed with GoldenPark. "Having only entered the Spanish market last year, we have significantly grown our presence recently and the Slingo content is really starting to resonate with the local audience," the company's Regional Account Manager said.</p>
<p>Moreover, Lagravinese explained: "Taking our games live with GoldenPark is a great achievement for us and a testament to the growing popularity of our content in the market and we are excited to further build on this partnership."</p>
<p>Spanish customers have already shown approval of Gaming Realms' portfolio of games, especially its Slingo titles. The engaging games provide a unique form of entertainment by combining bingo and slots.</p>
<p>The partnership represents an important milestone for GoldenPark, an operator that already has a strong presence within the online, as well as retail gambling market in Spain. Besides expanding the operator's offering, the collaboration helps Gaming Realms boost its presence in a strategic region for the company.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Gaming Realms confirmed it extended its licensing deal with King Show Games. Announced back in April, the deal enabled the company to continue to develop new versions of the famous King Show Games slots.</p>
<p>As a result, Gaming Realms can grow the Slingo versions of the popular slots, allowing it to expand further its portfolio of offering. The extended license agreement comes after the release of fan-favorite games such as Lucky Larry's Lobstermania Slingo, as well as Stinkin Rich Slingo.</p>
