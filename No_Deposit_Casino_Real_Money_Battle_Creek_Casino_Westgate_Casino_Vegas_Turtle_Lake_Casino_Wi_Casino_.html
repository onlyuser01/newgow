<p>Digitain, a leading provider of casino and sportsbook platforms and a company with dedicated API solutions from more than 150 partners, has struck a new partnership with BETER, a company that specializes in the delivery of advanced and innovative content for numerous gambling verticals, including esports and sports.</p>
<p>As a result of this newly-formed alliance, BETER will feature its ESportsBattle tournaments as part of the Digitain platform. Along with those, there will be also the Setka Cup table tennis events that are designed to boost viewership, engagement, and interest for operator audiences.</p>
<p>ESportsBattle is basically a product that runs small tournaments covering games such as Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. There is also a discipline called eFootball, but BETER is also soon hoping to roll out its eHockey and eBasketball formats as well. Then, there is the Setka Cup, which is once again a 24/7 live-streaming series of events in which select athletes compete against one another.</p>
<p>Sports audiences get to bet on more than 42,000 events every month across the ESportsBattle and Setka Cup formats. This is a significant opportunity to intelligently boost engagement with audiences. Commenting on the opportunity and what it means for Digitain, the company Chief Revenue Officer Iain Hutchison said:</p>
<p>"We go to great lengths to offer our partners the widest selection of player engagement betting content in the market and in BETER we have a provider at the cutting edge of esports content, live streaming and data and sports betting markets."</p>
<p>The executive has welcomed both the addition of the Setka Cup and ESportsBattle which Digitain will now leverage to bring even more excellent and innovative content to its partners – a list of more than 150 operators around the world.</p>
<p>BETER Chief Revenue Officer Chuck Robinson also joined the conversation and said that the sports and esports offered by his company was a product that was designed to elevate the experience for partners and introduce a brand new paradigm to the market.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to be working with such industry power players as Digitain," Robinson said. Thanks to this tie-up, Digitain’s partners will be able to explore formats such as eFootball and the Setka Cup and have plenty of quality content to offer to their respective audiences.</p>
