<p>Superbet, a prominent international gaming and betting operator and brand, has received an additional content injection from Bragg Gaming Group, a tech company and developer of iGaming titles.</p>
<p>Through a new alliance shared on the company’s official website, Bragg Gaming Group has launched its aggregation platform with Superbet in Brazil, a fast-evolving market which is poised to be one of the most significant drivers of online casino revenue over the next years.</p>
<p>Next year will be a litmus test for the true potential of Brazil as a regulated iGaming market, too, and Bragg and Superbet are keen to secure an early start.</p>
<p>Bragg’s strategy in Brazil and with Superbet is multi-pronged, as the company will rely both on third-party solutions as aggregated through its dedicated content platform, and it will equally seek out to add its own in-house games developed by prominent and established studios such as Indigo Magic and Atomic Slot Lab.</p>
<p>Superbet CRO Adam Shaw hailed Brazil as a market of significant potential with its regulation proving a significant milestone for the company and a guarantor for excellent online experiences, as imagined by Superbet and Bragg.</p>
<p>"Bragg’s aggregation platform supplies us with a diverse portfolio of proprietary and exclusive content as well as games from the industry’s most popular providers and we are thrilled to partner with them in Brazil," Shaw added.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group Commercial Director Matej Nemec was similarly keen to comment on the partnership and ponder its implications for the company.</p>
<p>Nemec noted that Bragg Gaming and Superbet have already been working together in Belgium and Serbia, and the new Brazilian iGaming launch is another milestone the two partners have in common to celebrate.</p>
<p>"We offer a wide portfolio of casino content that has already proven popular with local audiences in LatAm, and this partnership will further our ambitious growth plans for the region which will be a key focus for us in 2024," Nemec added, outlining the potential of the new market.</p>
<p>Bragg has been prolific in driving content partnerships across the globe. The company teamed up with Sportium in Spain and the company continued to develop its ties in the Dutch market with Entain and the company’s BetCity.nl brand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bragg Gaming has been similarly looking to secure fresh partnerships in the United States with the company signing up with BetMGM in New Jersey this November.</p>
