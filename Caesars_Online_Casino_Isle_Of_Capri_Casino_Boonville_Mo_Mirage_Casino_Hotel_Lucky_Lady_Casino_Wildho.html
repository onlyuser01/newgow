    <h1>Caesars Online Casino Isle Of Capri Casino Boonville Mo Mirage Casino Hotel Lucky Lady Casino Wildho</h1>

<p>March 7th</p>
<p>I played though a free spin bonus in which I went to cash out at $430 knowing they would remove and anything over $100.</p>
<p>March 14</p>
<p>it was rejected due to needing to make a bitcoin deposit of $20. Which okay I was fine but needed to wait for when I had funds available.</p>
<p>April20</p>
<p>I deposit $100 in BTC and of course the deposit time times out before the first confirmation so I explain that to customer service that the funds were sent to that BTC address and having screen shots and links to the process on the blockchain. They insisted that was wrong and then finally 5 hours or later they manually credited my account.</p>
<p>Problem was when they were in my account they removed the $100 winnings that was already in there. The whole reason I was depositing BTC to the site to begin with. When inquired about the missing money they insisted I played it or that it never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Which even according to my account statement and play history clearly showed the removal Of the funds without recrediting it.</p>
<p>One customer service person cause there must be 100 different names they use told me they removed it to add my deposit bonus back and to contact them when I was played through my funds.</p>
<p>Which I did, only to have every other customer service person tell me that I already played it. When you do catch them in their lies the chat gets disconnected.</p>
