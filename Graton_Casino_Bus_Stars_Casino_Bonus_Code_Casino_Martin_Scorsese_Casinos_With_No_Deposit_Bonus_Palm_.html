    <h1>Graton Casino Bus Stars Casino Bonus Code Casino Martin Scorsese Casinos With No Deposit Bonus Palm</h1>

<p>The complaint on another site has been extended again.Before adjusting the bonus, they wrote that they had some problems with the bonus engine, then I saw that 1.8LTC was withheld from me</p>
<p>138338 2023-11-18 14:06:22 —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∑–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏.—Ç–∏–ø.BONUS_CORRECTION –ü–ª–∞—Ç–µ–∂–∏ ‚Äì –£—Å–ø -1.85745655 -1.84023259.</p>
<p>When I won 41LTC, 09/21/2023, I put 11.60LTC on withdrawal.just test it as they bring it out , quickly or not.</p>
<p>I could have put all 41 LTC on withdrawal, but I decided to try to withdraw part of the winnings first, to check how quickly all this would happen.</p>
<p>A few days later, I received the first part of the winnings, then I wanted to get the remaining funds to withdraw 2 payments for 10LTC, 19.66LTC.</p>
<p>The casino assured me that as soon as I pass the 3rd stage of verification, they will give me the rest of the winnings, 29.66LTC</p>
<p>I passed the 3rd stage, they said they would pay within 48-72 hours.</p>
<p>Then they started telling me that they had no liquidity, and that it was not profitable for them to sell BTC to pay me my winnings, but promised that as soon as the markets recovered, I would be paidüòÇ</p>
<p>As a result, they did not pay, but said that they had to check the bets in the slots, although a few days before they said that the bets in the slots were made correctly.</p>
<p>After a couple more weeks, they requested again, a selfie with a passport, and a piece of paper with hieroglyphs</p>
<p>My account has already been verified, a few weeks ago.why they needed a passport and a piece of paper with hieroglyphs again, they did not explain to me.</p>
<p>Then they said that they had problems with the bonus engine, and they were checking the bets. Then they adjust the balance of 1.8LTC, without explaining anything, and then they stop responding at all.‚òπÔ∏è</p>
