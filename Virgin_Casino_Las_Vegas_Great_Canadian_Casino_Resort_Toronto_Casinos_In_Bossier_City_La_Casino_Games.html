<p>Oddin.gg, a leading esports betting business-to-business provider, has agreed to provide QTech Games with its full suite of esports solutions.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg Powers QTech with Esports Betting Solutions</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the leading gaming distributor for Asia will receive access to Oddin’s esports odds feeds, iFrame solution, esports-optimized UX and risk management. This will significantly enhance QTech’s offering while expanding Oddin’s global presence, allowing QTech’s Asian partners to adopt the provider’s esports solutions.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg is hailed as the go-to provider when it comes to everything related to esports betting. The B2B company offers robust esports feeds for the biggest competitive gaming titles, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), Dota 2 and League of Legends.</p>

<p>Spokespeople from the two companies addressed the newly-minted agreement. Daniel Long, the chief commercial officer of QTech Games, said that the deal with Oddin is very rewarding to his team. He praised the esports-oriented brand for simplifying an otherwise very complex field.</p>
<p>Significantly, since Oddin.gg boasts the highest industry uptime and sharpest odds, its solutions will also have a positive impact on our partners’ operating margins.

<p>Long added that QTech Games is fully committed to remaining relevant and supplying its partners with relevant in-demand content. The distributor leverages machine learning to identify player preferences in various regions.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg’s managing director and co-founder, Marek Suchar, also shared his thoughts on the agreement.
