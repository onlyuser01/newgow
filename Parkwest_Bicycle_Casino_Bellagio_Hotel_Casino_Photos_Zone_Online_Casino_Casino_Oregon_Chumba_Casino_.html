<p>New York City FC vs New England Revolution is a duel between two out-of-form teams. For one of them, the poor run might end on Saturday, June 3</p>
<p>NYCFC is the team that won the MLS Cup two years ago, but in 2023, the Bronx Blues are second from the bottom in the Eastern Conference. They’re without a win in their last six MLS games, but bookies see them as the favorites in Saturday’s game against the New England Revolution.</p>

<p>New York City FC Desperate for a Win</p>
<p>NYCFC is 4-4-7 this season, collecting just 16 points in 15 games. There’s just one team in the Eastern Conference that’s got fewer points than them – Inter Miami with 15 points.</p>
<p>However, NYCFC’s recent form is even worse than the one of Miami. The Bronx Blues are without a single win in the 2023 MLS since April 22 and are 0-1-5 in their last six games.</p>
<p>The main reason behind their disappointing run is that their offense has been somewhat anemic. For example, in their most recent game (3-1 loss to FC Cincinnati at home), they had the ball in their possession for 60% of time, creating 12 goal attempts along the way. Half of those were directed toward Cincy’s net. Unfortunately for them, only one of those went in.</p>
<p>This could be explained by the fact that Taty Castellanos, who was the MLS scoring leader in 2021, is no longer in New York. However, this team does have some amazing strikers on the roster. Twenty-one-year-old Brazilian Gabriel Pereira is a fine forward and so is his one-year younger colleague Magno Talles. Both of them have undisputed talent, but they just need to start scoring more.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Matias Pellegrini, who was once dubbed the next big thing in the MLS. The former Inter Miami forward, however, is still without a single goal to his name since joining NYCFC last summer.</p>
<p>New England Revolution’s Problems Keep Piling On</p>
<p>Despite their horrible form, the boys from Big Apple are favored to win on Saturday, June 3. The reason? New England Revolution’s players seem to be in an even worse shape right now.</p>
<p>Sure, these guys are still flying very high in the Eastern Conference, sitting in the No. 3 position at the moment, with 26 points after 15 games. However, they’re without a win in four MLS rounds, losing two and drawing two of those.</p>
<p>In those four games, they conceded a total of 11 goals, which accounts for 2.75 goals per game on average. The reason behind their poor defensive performances is that a couple of their key players are struggling with fitness. Defenders Henry Kessler and Brandon Bye, for example, are out, and so is defensive midfielder Lucas Maciel.</p>
<p>New York City FC vs New England Revolution Prediction</p>
<p>The home team has the player quality on its side, but the visitors are capable of causing problems to any opponent. Bruce Arena’s boys can score against literally any MLS team, NYCFC included. Still, their banged-up defense looks very vulnerable right now, which is why we’re certain the New Yorkers are going to score a couple of goals on Saturday.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t be surprised if the game saw four or even more goals, with a draw looking like the most plausible outcome.</p>
<p>Pick: New York City FC vs New England Revolution to draw &amp; over 3.5 goals</p>
