<p>FSB, a leading supplier of iGaming and online sports betting solutions, has reinforced its team with the addition of Marc Burroughes as director of account management. As his role suggests, Burroughes will be responsible for managing accounts on the provider’s platform amid the latter’s fast growth.</p>
<p>FSB Welcomes a New Director of Account Management</p>
<p>Burroughes brings over a decade of senior management experience to the team. He has worked for some of the best suppliers in the sector, including companies such as OpenBet and Scientific Games. During his time with the latter companies, Burroughes was in charge of their clients, which included notable operators such as Betfair, Danske Spil and Skybet. The appointee’s last stint was with GameScorekeeper, an innovative provider that targets the booming esports sector. There, Burroughes served as a chief commercial officer.</p>
<p>As a part of FSB’s team, the new hire will direct the company’s account management function and will leverage his expertise to help the company improve its relationship with existing partners. He joins FSB at an exciting time for FSB as the supplier was named Multi-Channel Supplier of the Year at the EGR B2B Awards. The award followed the company’s successes in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Burroughes Is Excited to Work with the Supplier</p>
<p>Glenn Elliott, FSB’s chief operating officer, welcomed Burroughes to the FSB family. He called the new hire a “dynamic appointment” into the company’s growing, global senior management team. Elliott added that FSB chose Burroughes because of his ability to listen and understand FSB’s partner community – something of crucial importance to the company.</p>
<p>FSB seeks to provide its clients with optimal products and help them grow. Burroughes will build on this momentum into 2023, helping both the supplier and its partners push forward. The new director of account management spoke about his new position:</p>
<p>FSB’s growth, momentum and accolades have shone strongly in 2022 and this is a great opportunity for me to join a rapidly growing organization. Marc Burroughes, director of account management, FSB</p>
<p>Burroughes added that his objective is clear – he must work closely with the company’s global network of partners and help them grow their businesses. In addition, FSB remains committed to giving its partners “a strong voice and representation” within the supplier’s network.</p>
<p>The new director of account management added that the weeks ahead are going to be busy ones because of the start of the FIFA World Cup during which FSB will supply its partners with many new products. Burroughes concluded that the soccer event will guarantee an exhilarating end of the year.</p>
