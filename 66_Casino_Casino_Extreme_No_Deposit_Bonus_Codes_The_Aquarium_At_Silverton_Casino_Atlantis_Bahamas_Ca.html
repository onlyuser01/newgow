    <h1>66 Casino Casino Extreme No Deposit Bonus Codes The Aquarium At Silverton Casino Atlantis Bahamas Ca</h1>

<p>Casino games developer Playson continued to expand its presence in the Latin American region after the announcement of a content deal signed with Venezuela-based operator Triples.</p>
<p>The new content deal will make sure Playson’s extensive suite of popular game titles including some recent slot releases such as The Fruit Megaways, Spirit of Egypt: Hold and Win and 9 Happy Pharaohs will be made available to players at Triples.</p>
<p>Commenting on the content deal, Playson Sales Director Blanka Homor outlined the “great step forward” for the game developer as it seeks to “grow in markets outside of Europe.”</p>
<p>“Latin America has proven to be a vibrant and prosperous region, therefore signing deals that allow us to strengthen our foothold in nations such as Venezuela is fantastic news for us and our partners.” Blanka Homor, Sales Director, Playson</p>
<p>As one of the leading online casino operators in Venezuela, Triples is actively expanding its product offering looking to acquire new players and has recently experienced a surge in new customer acquisitions. The agreement reached with Playson will allow the LatAm operator to expand its product offering and engage with a wider audience.</p>
<p>The content deal affirms Playson’s position as a supplier of engaging online gaming content within the Latin American region, serving as a recognition of the quality of its product and the company’s ability to engage with audiences across multiple markets.</p>
<p>Following Similar Expansion Pattern</p>
<p>It followed in the footsteps of a similar deal Playson signed with fellow Venezuela-based operator Parley, as well as Betconnections earlier this year to grant the platform provides access to a varied range of its slot titles including some of its hugely popular games Rich Diamonds: Hold and Win and Solar Queen and Divine Dragon: Hold and Win.</p>
<p>In line with Playson’s growth strategy in Latin America based on strategic partnerships with some of the most widely recognized commercial partners with an established presence in the region, the agreement with Betconnections further cemented the developer’s market position and expanded its regional footprint.</p>
<p>Outside of the Latin American region, Playson affirmed its European presence with a similar agreement signed with Full Force Gaming Group to launch its titles on the OmniSlots brand, as well as deals with Fortuna Entertainment Group and Magic Bet.</p>
