<p>The global gaming and entertainment company, Genting Group, announced last week that it opened the doors of its newest property in New York. Wednesday marked the grand opening ceremony of Resorts World Hudson Valley (RWHV), a venue that is expected to deliver unique experiences for its visitors and economic stimulus to the region.</p>
<p>Genting executives, local officials, community leaders and visitors all enjoyed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. According to a statement released by Genting, the visitors were treated to "a traditional Chinese lion dance performance."</p>
<p>New York's newest casino is located only 60 miles north of Manhattan at the Newburgh Mall in Orange County. The venue offers a huge 60,000 square feet of hospitality and gaming area. Visitors of the casino can enjoy 1,200 electronic table games as well as slot machines. What's more, RWHV offers a sports bar as well.</p>
<p>The opening of the new venue complements Genting's ongoing growth. In fact, the company's properties in New York have so far contributed more than $3.6 billion delivering invaluable support for public schools in the state.</p>
<p>Focusing on RWHV, the venue is expected to deliver some $65 million in taxes every year, further boosting the proceeds to New York public schools. Additionally, the new venue is planned to deliver a significant economic stimulus to the region.</p>
<p>RWHV is expected to boost tourism and help revitalize the region by helping attract new businesses and boosting the visitation for existing ones. By opening, the new casino also created 250 new full-time jobs. The average annual wage including benefits at RWHV is approximately $72,000, Genting revealed.</p>
<p>Besides entertaining experiences, visitors of RWHV can also take advantage of the Resorts World'sloyalty program called Genting Rewards. The loyalty program can deliver unique prizes and offerings and it is free upon registration with a valid photo ID.</p>
<p>Robert DeSalvio, Genting Americas East's President, shared his excitement saying: "What a gift to spend some time this holiday season welcoming guests and visitors to Resorts World Hudson Valley." He added: "Along with our partners in Orange County, we are elated the casino is now open for business and we can't wait for the area to begin to reap the benefits."</p>
<p>According to DeSalvio, the company was welcomed warmly by the community in Hudson Valley. "We can think of no better way to ring in 2023 than by celebrating right here with us at Resorts World Hudson Valley," said Genting Americas East's President in conclusion.</p>
