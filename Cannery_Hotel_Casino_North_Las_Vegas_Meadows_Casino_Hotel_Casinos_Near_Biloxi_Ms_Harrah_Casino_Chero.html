    <h1>Cannery Hotel Casino North Las Vegas Meadows Casino Hotel Casinos Near Biloxi Ms Harrah Casino Chero</h1>

<p>Hi All, Hi Kristina,</p>
<p>yes, ive deposited through paysafe card using their reload bonus. The bonus had wager attached, as usually im very careful with these bonuses, i read terms and conditions. They seemed ok the wager was a bit high I think, cant remember how much exactly but i think it was over 40x. That at first didnt matter to me, cause im trying to fill content to my yt channel where i post features of the slots im playing,and I usually lose my deposits..u all know how it goes. ðŸ˜‰ After hitting 1.1k on Shark Razor on 0,20c bet, ive managed to clear the wager. The wager progress is shown when you move your cursor over your balance, which i was monitoring closely. The wager was done and after wagering was done, most of my new high wins came in. So almost all subsequent wins were with money without bonus attached on it.</p>
<p>Ive deposited many times before on this casino, always using paysafe prepaid card, except when I spoke to support regarding withdrawal. Their rule states that you can only withdraw to the payment gate u used to deposit, but i knew that was impossible if I used prepaid card, so ive asked them if Skrill is ok. They replied yes, but that i need to make another deposit through skrill to link accounts. Ive deposited using no bonuses, to link it up, and also ive send them the requested screenshot of my skrill account for verification purposes.</p>
<p>All that happened around 24th of July (verification request/sent documents on their verification mail) , couple of days later maybe..but in this time frame. Since then, ive sent multiple mails to multiple email accounts that their support was not giving out easily. After communicating with their License issuer Antillephone, ive noticed additional emails in the header of the mails i received from Antillephone, so I know they were also present in the communication.</p>
<p>I wrote to all of them. No response what so ever. Ive made an official complaint to:</p>
<p>complaints@egamings.com</p>
<p>complaints@gaminglicences.com</p>
<p>*as instructed by - info@gaminglicences.com</p>
<p>No replies from any of these companies/organizations.</p>

<p>I am now really scared actually cause these guys now have all my personal info about me.</p>
<p>Another interesting stuff is that as soon as ive hit big on this casino with that razor shark win, ive registered for their affiliate program, into which i was accepted with ease and communication on this matter with them was lightning fast compared to now, that is practically ZERO.</p>
<p>So i dont know whats going on there, and what is up with this license regulators not responding...but i think this must be some white collar mafia operating deeply. I mean, small businesses....if you screw people up like this, and u get 5 complaints top to ur payment gateway, you will lose your payment gateway...but here, it seem like they are happy to be enabling casinos like these....i mean...a kid could check up this site and its company in 7 minutes and instantly know they are fishy, but adult professionals at companies like paypal and skrill, psc etc...they cant see it? and its all fine? ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ naah, i dont think so. But hey, thats just my half a penny...</p>
<p>I have no other communication to send you. The initial communication on live support was not recorded, ive started after ive suspected something aint right there. Live supp is claiming at every attempt, that they are just tech support and they dont know absolutely nothing about processing times and will not give out anything more than the email address you cant find in their casino site footer.</p>
<p>Ive even wrote them if they want to settle on the lower sum of payout or somehow restructure the payments, but as expected no response. Theyve responded to 0 of my mails.</p>
