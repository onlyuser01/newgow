<p>The partnership will strengthen both companies’ presence in the regulated Dutch iGaming market and will help establish them further into one of Europe’s fastest-growing and most lucrative jurisdictions for sports betting and iGaming. Playson has also been reporting strong results in the country, having established itself as the go-to supplier for many of the local operators.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Playson Sales Director Blanka Homor said that Betnation is indeed a fast-growing and exciting operator for Playson to be teaming up with and especially in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>"The country continues to garner a lot of interest with its online market continuing to evolve. As we strive to grow and reinforce our position, it’s important that we continue striking deals like this", Homor added.</p>
<p>Playson has similarly had many interesting developments to report over the past weeks. The company signed a multi-market expansion with 888casino, a respected and trusted iGaming brand with whom Playson is in good rapport. The pair increased their existing partnership to cover four new jurisdictions, including Italy, Romania, Sweden, and Denmark.</p>
<p>The supplier has been determined to make its presence felt across Europe and beyond. The company signed a partnership with Winbet for Romania and another one with Vincitu in Italy. The Netherlands as a market continues to attract interest from Europe’s major gambling companies, with LeoVegas Group recently obtaining a five-year license.</p>
