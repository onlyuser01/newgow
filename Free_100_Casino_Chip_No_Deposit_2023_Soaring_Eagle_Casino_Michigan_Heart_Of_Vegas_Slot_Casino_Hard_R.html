<p>The American Gaming Association expects more than 50 million Americans to wager on the Super Bowl LVII this weekend</p>
<p>A prediction made by the American Gaming Association (AGA) has outlined a record number of Americans likely to wager on the upcoming American football championship game of the National Football League for the 2022 NFL season.</p>
<p>The event will take place on February 12 at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, when the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs will be disputing the mouth-watering title in front of a massive audience.</p>
<p>Two in 10 American Adults to Place at Least One Bet</p>
<p>According to data collected from a nationwide sample that counted 2,199 adults, 20% of the Americans who are of the right age for gambling have expressed their intention to make at least one wager on the heated game.</p>
<p>The percentage represents more than 50.4 million Americans, marking a massive 61% increase compared to last year’s record number of bettors.</p>
<p>The AGA also expects the amount that will be wagered by these players to more than double compared to last year’s event, reaching the $16 billion mark. The figure will be 66% higher compared to the 2022 statistics.</p>
<p>The rest of the bettors (28 million) have expressed their intention to place casual bets with their friends or to join a pool or squares contest. This figure represented a 50% increase on a year-on-year basis.</p>
<p>As for their betting preferences, according to the pre-game survey, 44% of bettors expressed their plans to wager on Chiefs. The same percentage of bettors is expected to bet on a win from the Eagles.</p>
<p>NFL, More Interesting to Watch Since the Legalization of Sports Bets</p>
<p>The association explained that the legalization of sports betting in 33 US states and Washington DC have significantly influenced the rise in interest in the NFL.</p>
<p>According to the same data, 34% of sports fans stated the expansion of legal sports bets has turned watching NFL into a more interesting activity.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the continuously increasing interest in legalized sports wagers, AGA’s chief executive officer CEO Bill Miller explained the industry will stay committed to “responsibly delivering world-class entertainment, educating consumers about how to bet responsibly, and combating illegal gambling”.</p>
<p>Miller also acknowledged that the yearly Super Bowl is an excellent event that emphasizes the perks of legal betting on sports.</p>
<p>Among them is the way bettors are protected by regulated markets, the enhanced engagement recorded by sports media and leagues, and the extra tax revenue that reached state budgets.</p>
<p>Even more, the AGA has shown that over 70% of traditional Super Bowl bettors acknowledged seeing a campaign promoting safe betting in the past year.</p>
<p>Prop betting is also expected to turn into a popular wagering option during the upcoming championship that will be held at a stadium equipped with a sportsbook for the first time in history.</p>
