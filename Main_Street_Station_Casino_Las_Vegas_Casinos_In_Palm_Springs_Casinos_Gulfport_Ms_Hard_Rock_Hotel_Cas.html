<p>Take the Bank Slot Review</p>
<p>With an excellent countdown feature, free spins, random wilds, scatters, and other interesting mechanics to keep players at the edge of their seats while exploring the captivating storyline, Betsoft’s Take the Bank is a promising game for fans of the genre.</p>
<p>Thanks to its fast-paced action and generous payouts, the crime-themed slot with cartoonish characters and graphic elements puts a bank robbery at the center. After careful consideration and a detailed and comprehensive review compiled by our professional slot reviewers, we have concluded that Take the Bank is a quality game from the reputable studio Betsoft that does a great job at further boosting its reputation as one of the most reliable creators of slots in the online and mobile gaming world.</p>
<p>If you are ready to learn more about the theme, storyline, symbols and their payouts, features and mechanics, sounds and animations, and overall gameplay, keep exploring our review.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Get Ready for the Heist of Your Life</p>
<p>Without a doubt, slots that revolve around crime have been growing in popularity in recent years. Since Take the Bank features a heist-themed adventure ready to be explored by players from the comfort of their homes or remote locations via a plethora of compatible mobile devices, there is no wonder the game keeps attracting a lot of attention several years after its official release in 2019.</p>
<p>Since all big and iconic robberies take a lot of planning and hard work, the studio took a similar approach when crayoning the theme, storyline, and all the complementary graphic design elements that beautifully round up the game. Straight off the bat, players will notice Betsoft has paid a great deal of attention to detail when designing the prybars, cash stacks, the doors of the vaults, and the rest of the intertwined symbols seen landing on the reels and 75 pay lines on the grid.</p>
<p>Players must primarily throw the focus on the ticking bomb symbol that will effectively count down to a wild symbol explosion visible all across the screen. While the arrival of the police is never good news for the crooks, it will benefit players who will get to redeem a special bounty consisting of free games and added wild symbols.</p>
<p>The backdrop of the game is represented by the mighty skyscrapers seen mercilessly piercing the night sky right behind the old bank in the city center. As previously mentioned, the choice of graphics is absolutely remarkable, and while not truly realistic, the backdrop is rather convincing and interesting enough to keep players hooked.</p>
<p>In contrast with the serious theme centered around a bank robbery, the game also features a series of comedic or cartoonish-looking elements including the police car or the bank robber who shows up in a black and white striped shirt. Fans of the genre who prefer crime-themed slots packed with gore and guns may not entirely appreciate Betsoft’s release.</p>
<p>Take the Bank: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The highest-paying symbols in the game are the diamonds, the gold bars, and the cash stacks. Landing two, three, four, or five diamond symbols will bring players payouts of 0.10x, 0.40x, 1.20x, and 6x. The mid-paying symbols are represented by the gold bullions paying 0.30x, 0.60x, and 2x for landing three, four, or five symbols, and stashes of cash symbols paying 0.30x, 0.50x, and 1.80x for three, four, or five matching symbols respectively.</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols are represented by the safe door, the red bomb, and the crowbar symbols each paying 0.20x, 0.40x, and 1.20x for three, four, or five identical symbols showing up on the reels. On the lower end, players will discover the ‘A’ that reward players with payouts of 0.20x, 0.40x, and 1.20x and ‘K’, ‘Q’, ‘J’, ’10’, and ‘9’ triggering wins of 0.10x, 0.20x, and 0.60x each.</p>
<p>The game also has the crafty robber as the wild. The police cars represent the scatter. Matching three scatters at a time unlocks the free spins feature we are going to speak more about below. The highest payout can reach up to $4,500 which represents 225x the initial wager.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>As expected, the background music does a good job of setting the mood with its fast pace and well-selected sound effects. The latter features sounds of a break-in and the police cars getting near. The exploding bombs and moving police cars in their chase against the bad guys are some of the animations used for the game.</p>
<p>Take the Bank Gameplay</p>
<p>The slot has simple gameplay on the five reels and 75 pay lines. New players need to start by setting the value of the minimum bet amount per payline. The value ranges from $0.20 to $20 on a single spin. Next, players will need to use the “+” and “-” icon located at the bottom of the screen to toggle and adjust their best according to their specific needs. The pay lines are fixed and they do not require adjusting.</p>
<p>The gameplay can be customized using the Autoplay feature that lets players select the desired number of automated spins they would like to initiate together with the total cost of each spin. There is also a sped-up Turboplay alternative as well as the possibility to adjust the sound and background effects.</p>
<p>Finally, on the home screen, players can click the spin button to get started and keep an eye on the bomb-shaped countdown timer that will gradually decrease from 10 down to 0. Once the counter hits zero, the robber symbols turn into wilds and scatters and show the payout.</p>
<p>There is also a double-up feature available for standard wins where players can predict the result of a coin flip and possibly double their wins. There is also a buy feature that lets players purchase 15 free spins and engage in play using five, seven, or 10 wild symbols.</p>
<p>Take the Bank: Heist Spins &amp; Free Spins</p>
<p>Heist Spins</p>
<p>To engage in a one-of-a-kind progression system, players must keep an eye on the bomb counter every time they are ready to spin the reels again. The robber symbol will turn into bombs. At the end of 10 free spins, the bombs will turn into wild symbols.</p>
<p>Free Spins</p>
<p>To enter the bonus game, players need to land a minimum of three police car symbols. In the bonus game, players get five, seven, or 10 epic wild symbols spread all across the reels. Each new spin will relocate the wilds to a brand new location on the grid, paying out huge wins.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Take the Bank is a captivating video slot from Betsoft with an intriguing bank robbery theme that is appealing to players who appreciate both standard and innovative gameplay. The base game is engaging on its own, but when the special features come to life, wilds and scatters truly make the slot pop.</p>
