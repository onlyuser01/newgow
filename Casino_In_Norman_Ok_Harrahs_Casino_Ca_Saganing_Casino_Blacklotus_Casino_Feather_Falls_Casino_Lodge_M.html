    <h1>Casino In Norman Ok Harrahs Casino Ca Saganing Casino Blacklotus Casino Feather Falls Casino Lodge M</h1>

<p>Thank you for your help. I received a 55% deposit bonus e-mail, so I decided to play a little, I made a small deposit, and when I ran out of real money while playing, a pop-up said that I couldn't use the bonus unless I ran out of real money. It came out. Over and over again, I asked the customer support chat if it really had to be 0, but they didn't tell me clearly, and eventually the chat was cut off, so I came here without receiving support. rice field.</p>
<p>I've never heard of such a bonus and I feel angry as if I was scammed.</p>
<p>Since it is not possible to make it exactly 0, is there no choice but to leave it as it is?</p>
