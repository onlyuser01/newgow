    <h1>New Online Casino Real Money Casino Strike Casino Green Bay Nh Casinos Bally S Chicago Casino Las At</h1>

<p>Las Atlantis is a scam! I gamble at a lot of online sites and seen a lot of second hand dirty crap but I read your reviews and decided to try it and deposited 60 and used a welcome bonus and got lucky and hit over 6000 but I knew from terms I read that I could only cash out 30x my deposit so that was suppose to be 1800. Then I went threw every hoop they could come up with every 3 days to get my account verified which I understand then ask if my Bitcoin is static lol another 3 day wait, it’s ridiculous how they draw that out. Then I finally got verified gotta wait another 3 days (excluding weekends) and then I was approved then another 3 days then it was accepted but only for 300 and they put the other 1300 back on my play account and I ask in chat and they said we have right to pay out in Payments read your terms, I said I saw where if it was over 2500 then I would have to but not 1600 and not so low of payments. They were not helpful just sent pre ready answers and now I’m waiting my 3 more days to see if I even see 300 in my Bitcoin account. And I ask when or if I was gonna be able to get rest and told to read the terms and conditions..what terms and conditions? My withdraw was approved! Then only 300.(waiting 3 more days to see if that goes to my Bitcoin) I would have deposited more I usually play 100- 200 a week I just was trying them out and got lucky or so I thought lol. If you can help me I would appreciate it. When I loose I don’t mind loosing but when I win I want my money or I might as well play the free version! T</p>
