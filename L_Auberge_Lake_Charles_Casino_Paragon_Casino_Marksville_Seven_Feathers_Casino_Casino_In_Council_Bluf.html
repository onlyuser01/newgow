<p>The new AML agreement further strengthened the bond between Everi Holdings and the BCLC</p>
<p>Provider of casino gaming products and player loyalty solutions Everi Holdings announced it has signed a new agreement with the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) to extend their partnership into anti-money laundering (AML).</p>
<p>‘Adapting to Customer Needs’</p>
<p>Under the new arrangement, Everi Holdings will provide the BCLC with its Everi Compliance AML solution to support the gaming and online operations of the Canadian operator and ensure compliance with the AML laws in the country.</p>
<p>Darren Simmons, executive vice president and FinTech Business Leader at Everi Holdings, outlined the supplier’s commitment “to adapting to customer needs” and creating “exciting new opportunities” in line with “industry changes.”</p>
<p>“BCLC has prioritized high levels of compliance as part of the continued expansion of their fast-growing gaming operations in casinos and online platforms across British Columbia,” Simmons continued, delighted that the BCLC has chosen Everi and its RegTech solutions that “are designed for a wide variety of applications” to support its critical AML program.</p>
<p>Everi Holdings will provide support for BCLC’s operations across lottery, casino, bingo, and online gaming as the corporation offers British Columbians gaming on behalf of the province. Providing AML services to over 600 gaming properties, Everi’s software is the most widely used AML solution available for the gaming industry.</p>
<p>The new agreement further deepened the existing collaboration between the parties as Everi is already supplying slot content for BCLC’s land-based and online casinos via its online gaming division, Every Digital, which is the largest provider of three-reel stepper products to BCLC’s PlayNow.com the online casino brand.</p>
<p>Diversified Portfolio of Products</p>
<p>Manufacturer of gaming equipment Everi Holdings is also providing trusted financial technology to power casino floor payment operations including products and services that facilitate cashless payments, as well as loyalty solutions via its Everi Payments subsidiary.</p>
<p>In November, Everi Payments, in partnership with Railsr, introduced an embedded credit and loyalty card for its customers as part of its digital CashClub Wallet technology aimed at building customer loyalty through everyday experiences by linking retail gaming venues with other amenities such as restaurants, hotels and others.</p>
<p>Also in November, Everi’s digital arm became the latest partner to provide online gaming content for Pariplay’s Fusion aggregation platform, adding more than 60 of Everi’s titles to the platform’s impressive portfolio of over 14,000 games provided by more than 80 suppliers.</p>
<p>A month earlier, Everi Payments teamed with Prove Identity to add the identity verification services provider to its list of providers and utilize its services across the entire casino ecosystem, including funding for gaming devices on-site, payment for point-of-sale machines and a variety of funding access options at casino floors.</p>
