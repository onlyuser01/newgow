<p>After suffering a disappointing loss to Southampton mid-week, Tottenham will try to recuperate in the game with the Wolves on Sunday, February 13.</p>
<p>The game is taking place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, which is where the hosts have collected 22 points this season. Unfortunately for the Spurs, in Round 25, they’re taking on a team that’s amazing on the road. In 11 away matches in the Premier League, Wolves collected 20 points.</p>
<p>Betting odds suggest Tottenham will win, but Wolves are a force that should be reckoned with. This team is coming to London after three straight away wins in the Prem. Knowing all this, it’s very likely we’ll witness a real barnburner on Sunday.</p>

<p>Antonio Conte Coming Off His First Home Loss as Spurs Manager</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, Antonio Conte suffered his first Premier League loss at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since the start of his reign as the Spurs boss. The worst thing about that game is that Conte’s boys had a lead until the 79th minute of the game.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the game saw the return of Son Heung-Min to the scoresheet. After missing four games due to an injury, and failing to score on his comeback, Tottenham’s top-scorer ended his drought mid-week.</p>
<p>What’s worrying is that Tottenham captain Harry Kane still hasn’t found his mojo. The man whom we saw scoring at least 17 goals in each of the previous seven Premier League seasons is currently at just five EPL goals.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the skipper’s been scoring in other competitions. For example, in the FA Cup game against Brighton a week ago, he scored two of Tottenham’s three goals.</p>
<p>Wolves Want to Continue Well on the Road</p>
<p>So far in the 2021-22 season, Wolves won a total of ten Premier League matches. Six of those happened on the road. The best thing is that this team’s won in its previous three away games, beating Brighton, Manchester United, and Brentford.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Wolves also have a decent record when playing against the Spurs in London. Wolves won two of their previous four trips to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. This time, however, oddsmakers don’t think it’s going to happen. Wolves are seen as huge underdogs in this game.</p>
<p>One reason is that the Spurs are probably super-motivated to win. Another reason might be that Wolves are coming off two home losses. First, they lost to Norwich in the FA Cup; then we saw them lose to Arsenal in the Prem.</p>
<p>Another loss is probably on the way, but you can be sure that the Wolves aren’t going to get embarrassed by the Spurs. Instead, a win by a single goal seems like a very probable outcome.</p>
<p>Picks: Tottenham to Win; Under 2.5 Goals</p>
