<p>Alex Kornilov, the chief executive officer of Betegy, welcomed Golovina to the company. He noted that his team is always looking for innovative and ambitious people – a description that the new CMO fits perfectly. As part of JKR Investment, Golovina has already worked closely with Betegy, which is why Kornilov is convinced of her qualities.</p>
<p>The CEO concluded that the current period of intensive growth means that Betegy is always in need of qualified employees:</p>
<p>It is a period of significant upscale for us, and we will always have space for hard-working, forward-thinking employees. We look forward to a number of exciting announcements in the near future and continuing our upwards trajectory. Alex Kornilov, CEO, Betegy</p>
