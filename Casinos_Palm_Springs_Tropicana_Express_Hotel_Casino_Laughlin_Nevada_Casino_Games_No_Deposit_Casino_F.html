<p>After a lot of anticipation, some final ironing out of details, and a bit of internal restructuring, ESPN BET is ready to launch in 17 states across the United States, with the date now confirmed for November 14, 2023. With the NFL season ongoing and the Super Bowl looming, ESPN BET will not have to worry about properly testing its offer in the realities of the competitive sports betting market.</p>
<p>The company already confirmed its new logo last month and has now doubled down that its entry into regulated sports wagering will also get underway before long. ESPN has not wasted time either and has tapped directly into ESPN BET to create editorial and other content, helping drive synergies between its product offerings and bringing more value to consumers familiar with its brands, as well as potential new readers and bettors, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>ESPN has outlined three major initiatives designed to celebrate the upcoming launch, including the ESPN Headquarters Sweepstakes where fans can enter, as the name telling reveals, into a sweepstakes and end up on a trip to Bristol, Connecticut to visit the company’s HQ.</p>
<p>There is also the Daily Wager Rebrand, which was an early-day overture by ESPN in the sports betting market, although it was launched at a time when the network was only flirting with the vertical, and not nearly as many states had sports betting up and running.</p>
<p>The Daily Wager Rebrand will change the name of the eponymous show to ESPN BET Live, and it will in fact get ahead of the game by airing on November 6. The last show episode as the Daily Wager will be aired on November 6.</p>
<p>Not least, there is ESPN BET Creative which is designed to demonstrate what the company described as "cohesiveness" between the ESPN and ESPN BET brands, featuring SportsCenter anchor Scott Van Pelt, as shown in the video above. This is part of the creative campaign that will seek to increase ESPN BET’s brand awareness in time for its launch.</p>
<p>The 17 states where ESPN BET will be available on the launch date are Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.</p>
