<p>BMM Testlabs, a company lauding itself as the most experienced private independent gaming certification lab in the world, will be allowed to check casino equipment in the state of Nebraska.</p>
<p>BMM Testlabs Forays into Nebraska</p>
<p>The certification expert has successfully received approval from the Nebraska Racing and Gaming Commission. Now that the state regulator has cleared BMM for launch, the company will be able to check and certify casino equipment in the state.</p>
<p>Nebraska currently has only casinos that are operated by local Native American tribes. Since the Cornhusker State does not have an online market, are the only venues where players may enjoy casino games.</p>
<p>In addition, Nebraska is a pretty small market, with fewer than 2 million people where only those aged 21 or more can gamble. Despite that, expanding into the state is still good news for BMM Testlabs as it means the company will be able to expand its influence.</p>
<p>The Company Is Looking Forward to Working with Companies in the State</p>
<p>Travis Foley, chief technology officer and executive vice president for NA at BMM, spoke about the launch in Nebraska. He shared that his team is glad to receive approval from Nebraska’s Racing and Gaming Commission and enter the state.</p>
<p>BMM is very pleased to have been approved to provide testing services for casino gaming equipment in Nebraska. Travis Foley, CTO, BMM Testlabs</p>
<p>Foley praised Melissa Shuba, the company’s VP of government affairs and Meagan DeMello, BMM’s compliance manager, for making the Nebraska launch happen. He lauded the two officers’ excellent job in helping BMM enter new and emerging markets.</p>
<p>Foley thanked Nebraska’s Racing and Gaming Commission for trusting his company and said that he values BMM’s relationship with the regulator. He also noted that the Commission’s team has been very helpful and cooperative during the licensing process.</p>
<p>Lastly, Foley had a few words about BMM Testlabs’ plans for the state. He promised that the testing company will leverage its decades of experience to offer the best testing services. BMM will make sure that all of its clients’ casino equipment corresponds to the standards. Casino suppliers can now seek BMM Testlabs to have their equipment checked.</p>
<p>A few days ago, BMM Testlabs also received a license to launch its services in Ohio. A year ago, the company also received approval to launch in Ontario, which further solidified its presence in North America. Overall, BMM has a strong global presence. A month ago, the certification lab reinforced its Australian team with two new vice presidents.</p>
