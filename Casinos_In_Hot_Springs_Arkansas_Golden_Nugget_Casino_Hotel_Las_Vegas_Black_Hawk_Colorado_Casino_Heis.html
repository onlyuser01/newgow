<p>Gaming and lottery provider Scientific Games (SG) announced today its digital division reached an agreement with global online casino supplier NetEnt. Under the terms of the deal, NetEnt’s iGaming content will be distributed through SG Digistal’s OpenGaming platform across regulated US markets.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Boosts Its Platform Offering</p>
<p>By joining forces with the world’s largest developer of slot games, SG is looking to extend its presence across US jurisdictions. Its OpenGaming aggregation platform has integrated a wide range of popular releases of the gaming content provider, which is now available in New Jersey. OpenGaming availability for NetEnt’s content will soon expand to include platform partners into Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“This strategic partnership is highly beneficial for both Scientific Games and NetEnt. Together, we’re in a strong position to make further inroads into the US iGaming market and deliver outstanding content to more players across multiple states.” Dylan Slaney, SVP Casino, SG Digital</p>
<p>The slot portfolio of NetEnt featuring blockbuster titles such as Divine Fortune, Starburst and Gonzo’s Quest will add another dimension to Scientific Games’ OpenGaming offering and will mark a significant milestone in SG’s consistent attempts to build the world’s largest aggregation platform for iGaming.</p>
<p>“NetEnt’s games need no introduction and we’re very confident that our operating partners in the US will appreciate the high-quality gameplay they offer players. Our vision for OpenGaming has always been an aggregation platform at scale with features that work across multiple studios in every regulated market. We’re looking forward to working with the team at NetEnt. ” Dylan Slaney, SVP Casino, SG Digital</p>
<p>NetEnt Content Enters the Perfect Ecosystem</p>
<p>OpenGaming platform features in excess of 2,500 games, both in-house developed titles and content from third-party studios, as well as features such as jackpots, free-rounds, missions and tournaments, and represents the perfect ecosystem for NetEnt’s slot gaming content. The platform also has built-in responsible gaming tools which are at player’s disposal during gameplay.</p>
<p>“Expanding our presence in the US market is paramount for NetEnt and collaborating with Scientific Games while leveraging the power of their OpenGaming platform fits that strategy. We’re excited about working with Scientific Games in the US and look forward to launching our popular slots with more operators in the coming months.” Brian Kraft, VP Commercial, NetEnt Americas LLC</p>
<p>Besides the slot content agreement, the two companies are further exploring collaboration opportunities aimed at providing cutting-edge experience to players across all regulated markets.</p>
<p>Both companies have been active on the partnership front recently, as Scientific Games extended its partnership with Hard Rock International, while NetEnt, besides being a target for acquisition from Evolution Gaming, expanded on Pennsylvania digital footprint by launching its online content for Wind Creek Casino.</p>
