<p>The last race at the 80-year-old racetrack in Northville, Michigan, will take place on February 3, but Northville Downs plans to open at a new location</p>
<p>After operating for 80 years, Northville Downs, Michigan’s last horse racing track, will discontinue its operations at its current location as of early next month. Details released by the gambling regulator in the state, the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB), reveal that the final race for Northville Downs at its current location at 301 S. Center St. in Northville is scheduled for Saturday, February 3, 2024.</p>
<p>The closure is related to a $250 million redevelopment of the racecourse. Previously, Northville Downs bought some 128 acres of land to use for building its new harness racing facility. The aforementioned piece of land is located on the corner of Five Mile and Ridge roads in Plymouth Township. According to the MGCB, the building of the new facility is subject to approval from the township board.</p>
<p>Considering the upcoming closure, bettors are no longer going to be able to place simulcast wagers in person at the current Northville Downs location starting from Monday, February 5, 2024. Still, the racetrack confirmed that it plans to reintroduce simulcast wagering at its new location. On the other hand, February 10, 2024, marks the last day patrons will be able to cash out winning wagers at Northville Downs. After this date, horse racing patrons can mail their winning tickets to Northville Downs, 47526 Clipper St., PO Box 701220, Plymouth, MI 48170, according to the MGCB.</p>
<p>“Northville Downs, the last horse racing track in Michigan, will soon cease operations at its current location at 301 S. Center St. in Northville after 80 years of providing excitement and entertainment to avid horse racing enthusiasts. The final race is scheduled to take place on Saturday, Feb. 3, 2024,“ reads a statement released by the MGCB</p>
<p>Michigan to Witness the Next Chapter of Horse Racing</p>
<p>Henry Williams, MGCB’s executive director, thanked all patrons at Northville Downs who enjoyed race days and visited the venue frequently. “We appreciate the support of those who have kept Northville Downs going for 80 years and look forward to the next chapter of horse racing in Michigan at a new location,” he added.</p>
<p>“The Michigan Gaming Control Board expresses our deepest gratitude to all of the Northville Downs patrons who have made each race day memorable and thrilling.“ Henry Williams, executive director at the MGCB</p>
<p>While Northville Downs will cease to operate at its current location in preparation for its new racetrack, fans of horse racing will be able to continue placing wagers via their mobile devices without interruptions. Patrons across Michigan can access licensed providers in the state, including FanDuel Racing, Xpressbet, NYRA Bets or Churchill Downs/Twin Spires to place wagers on popular events such as the Kentucky Derby, among others.</p>
