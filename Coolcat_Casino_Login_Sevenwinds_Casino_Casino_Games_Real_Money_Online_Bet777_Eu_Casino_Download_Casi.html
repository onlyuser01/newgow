<p>Information about IGT games</p>
<p>IGT, or International Game Technology, has been around for many years and is one of the best-known names in the iGaming industry. It was originally a Las Vegas-based gaming manufacturer, supplying slot machines and other technology to land-based casinos across the United States.</p>
<p>The 1990s saw IGT listed on the New York Stock Exchange as they expanded their services abroad to countries such as Argentina and South Africa. It was a prosperous time for the company marked by the stunning success of its Wheel of Fortune progressive slot, based on the hit TV show of the time.</p>
<p>The company's universal presence in bricks-and-mortar establishments around the globe meant that there wasn't a huge focus on internet games until 2010, several years later than many other providers. This was when they established an interactive division with the aim of growing their online operations, and IGT fans had a range of exciting virtual games to choose from.</p>
<p>However, the next few years would see the company suffer from internal disputes and heavy debt, which led to Italian firm Gtech acquiring them for $6.4 billion (including $1.7 billion assumed debt) in 2015. The new-look company, now based in London, had an ambitious outlook, aiming to dominate the iGaming market.</p>
<p>Today, it continues to release both land-based slots and lottery games across multiple platforms, continuing its status as a leading casino content provider.</p>
<p>IGT slots and casino games</p>
<p>IGT knows a successful formula when it sees one, which is why you'll see several variations of its famous Wheel of Fortune slot game. Its Exotic Far East version is one that holds a progressive jackpot along with plenty of bonus games, such as the special Ca$h Link feature, which is activated when you land both special coin and treasure chest symbols. The amount you win depends on the value of the coins. Wheel of Fortune symbols and a treasure chest will give you a spin on the jackpot wheel, the highlight of the game. The game is action-packed and designed to entertain you with its Far-East design and music.</p>
<p>Another popular IGT title is Cleopatra, a slot based on the famous ancient Queen. Like Cleopatra herself, the reels are draped in jewels and decorations, and the bright graphics and symbols are attractive to play on. In terms of gameplay, however, it's pretty ordinary. The bonus round is simply free spins and a multiplier, while the Wilds symbol (a logo of the queen) is nothing special. It's a hit with slots players, though, so give it a go to see if you like it as much as others do.</p>
<p>For those looking for a fun take on things, then IGT's Ghostbusters-themed slot is a great way to pass the time. Surprisingly life-like symbols of the team are displayed on the reels, along with the foursome's famous car and ghostbusting equipment. There are four bonus games, with the highlight being the 4 Mystery feature – a Wild Reels win here can lead to big gains. Also, watch out for the farting ghost when wins are paid out, something that will amuse the childish ones among us.</p>
