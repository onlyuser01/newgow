    <h1>Casino Ballroom Live Casino Arundel Mills Maryland Casino Live Casino Bonus Betvisa Casino Real Deal</h1>

<p>The developer of innovative content and live casino products, Real Dealer Studios, has fans enrapt in its latest installment of a sports-themed roulette game</p>
<p>Rugby Fever Roulette utilizes the studio’s well-established technology that allows it to create realistic and engaged experiences with the help of pre-recorded video segments, featuring a Hollywood-style level of editing and cinematography.</p>
<p>Rugby Becomes Centerpiece in Real Dealer’s Latest Roulette</p>
<p>Rugby Fever Roulette is not a precedent for the company, as it is a successor of Hockey Fever Roulette, another innovative concept that has become one of the studio’s top performers upon release in April, and which has been delivering an outstanding experience to players, operators, and the studio itself.</p>
<p>Both games are designed to appeal to male sports fans, but Rugby Fever Roulette has taken the overall personalization angle a step further by offering players to choose from five countries. This way, players can pick from England, Ireland, New Zealand, Italy, or Argentina, creating a captivating experience that strikes home through the power of customization and thematic accuracy.</p>
<p>Real Dealer Studios CPO Shane Cotter has welcomed the opportunity to introduce yet another game based on the Cinematic RNG technology pioneered and mastered by his company. Cotter added:</p>
<p>We’ve seen a huge interest in sportsbook-related promotion for Rugby Fever Roulette as operators gear up for the kickoff in France. They’ve been particularly impressed that players can choose their country and dealer in the game while still enjoying the kind of next-level dealer experience they’ve come to expect from our products. Real Dealer Studios CPO Shane Cotter</p>
<p>Delivering iGaming Experience with a Hollywood Flourish</p>
<p>Real Dealer Studios has been using professional actors and directors to achieve a level of product quality that is hardly matched in the industry, and that brings players constant joy and the opportunity to experience popular game formats in a completely new format.</p>
<p>The game will be available exclusively from Games Global, and Real Dealer Studios continues to build up its offer with more exciting releases planned for the rest of the year. In the meantime, Real Dealer Studios has been building up its offer, adding more iconic characters and personalities to its games.</p>
<p>For example, the company revealed a roulette game featuring Rachael Bower, and another game, blackjack, featuring Vinnie Jones.</p>
