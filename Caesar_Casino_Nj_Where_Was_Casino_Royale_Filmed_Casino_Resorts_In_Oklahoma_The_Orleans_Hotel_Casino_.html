    <h1>Caesar Casino Nj Where Was Casino Royale Filmed Casino Resorts In Oklahoma The Orleans Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>I have 100 Euros sat on my account as well as one outstanding withdrawal for 304 Euros, a total of 404 Euros which is legally my money.</p>
<p>In addition I won 2942 Euros at the weekend having satisfied the 45 x wagering requirements from a 100 Euros deposit which resulted in a 200 Euros uplift/bonus being applied to my account.</p>
<p>I checked the Bonus % indicator throughout the day which went from 0% to 100% and at no point was I told that I didn't play correctly. Every spin of the game was allowed from 0% to 100% with not a single message being displayed.</p>
<p>I then made three separate withdrawals of 1000 Euros, 1000 Euros and 942 Euros as 1000 Euros is the maximum single withdrawal permitted.</p>
<p>Winstler then emailed me to say that all of my winnings had been confiscated and that I would not be receiving the money. This is fraud and absolute robbery. Unethical, immoral, indefensible and inexcusable.</p>
<p>I am reserving my rights on whether to enlist legal support to recover the money owed to me which is 2942 Euros + the 404 Euros also owed to me, a total of 3346 Euros which they are trying to steal from me.</p>
<p>I would be hugely grateful for a positive intervention from you.</p>
