<p>Dear ivanbejarano133,</p>
<p>I have tried to discuss your case with the 20Bet Casino team, but they are not willing to change their position. Strictly technically speaking, the casino team is right, and we have received evidence from them of multiple accounts linked with personal information, such as name, address, date of birth, etc., which is a breach of the casino T&amp;Cs as mentioned here:</p>
<p>Each registered customer may have only one account. Customers may register only one account per family, address, e-mail address, IP address, credit/debit card, e-wallet or electronic payment method. Persons otherwise associated with a customer will not be allowed to register on the website.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at Casino Guru, we are making efforts to contribute towards a safer and more friendly environment for both players and casinos. Simply adhering to rules without thoughtful consideration is not what we believe to be a fair approach, and instances like this should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The initial account was created a considerable time ago and has remained inactive for over six months since the establishment of the new account. The player did not have any prior restrictions, such as self-exclusion or limitations due to gambling issues, and the original account was neither closed nor suspended for potential fraud or abuse. Therefore, having two accounts did not provide the player with any unfair advantages. As we mention in our Fair Gambling Codex:</p>
<p>Our position</p>
<p>Each case should be considered separately. If the casino finds out that a player has created five separate accounts, for example, and claimed the full bonus amount on each of them, it is likely that this is a bonus abuser, and the casino has every right to penalize them. On the other hand, if a casual player mistakenly creates two accounts and doesn't even claim the bonus, the casino shouldn't penalize them just because it has a rule that can be used against them.</p>
<p>I attempted to convey our stance to the 20Bet Casino team, but regrettably, no compromise could be reached, and they maintained their initial position. Consequently, I am compelled to mark this complaint as "unresolved" in our system. I understand this isn't a satisfactory solution to your issue. However, the decrease in ratings caused by unresolved complaints might help change the casino's approach. If the casino decides to react, we will reopen the complaint, and you will be notified by email.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend ensuring that you only create a single account. If you are uncertain whether you have already registered an account with a particular casino, it is advisable to verify this with the casino team to avoid such situations in the future.</p>
<p>Sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino and we will try our best to help.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
<p>Casino Guru</p>
