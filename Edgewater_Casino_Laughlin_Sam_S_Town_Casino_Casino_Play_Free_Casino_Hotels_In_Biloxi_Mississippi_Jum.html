<p>Apparat Gaming, an established supplier and innovative developer of content, has partnered up with Grand Casino Bern in Switzerland, strengthening its presence in the country further. The partnership covers 13 certified slot games developed by Apparat that will now roll out on Grand Casino Bern’s online casino platform, 7 Melons.</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming has built a robust reputation among local and German-speaking audiences for products that stand out by the virtue of their quality, sound maths, and absolute "no sense of humor," as the company loves to jest.</p>
<p>Amongst the titles that are introduced to 7Melons, and the brand’s players are games such as Jack Potter, Warlock’s Book, Heimdall’s Horn, 40Sevens, and more.</p>
<p>Both companies have seen reason to bring this partnership online, with Apparat Gaming Co-founder and CPO Martin Frindt arguing that Switzerland is a market that has a clear-cut and efficient gambling framework, which allows companies such as Apparat to operate with confidence.</p>
<p>"Our suite of classic and video slots offers the unique German Accent player experience. Apparat Gaming and 7Melons are a winning combo, which we plan to expand step by step with more games in the future," Frindt explained.</p>
<p>The opportunity was naturally hailed by Grand Casino Bern COO Online Casino GeraldFineder who was similarly pleased and said that 7Melons is one of the leading online gaming destinations in Switzerland, a status that it is now further consolidating with Apparat Gaming’s help.</p>
<p>This partnership comes two months after the supplier first launched in the exciting Swiss iGaming market with Bern competitor, Grand Casino Baden. The company has since been building up its footprint in the country, with brands such as Casinò Lugano and mycasino.</p>
<p>Although focused on German-speaking jurisdictions for the most part, Apparat Gaming has been keen to introduce its "eye candy" games to a global audience, starting with other markets in Europe first.</p>
<p>In October, the company made its first foray into the Spanish-regulated gambling market through a Paf link-up. More successful rollouts are imminent for the supplier as it seeks to further establish its footprint in new markets and with new partners.</p>
