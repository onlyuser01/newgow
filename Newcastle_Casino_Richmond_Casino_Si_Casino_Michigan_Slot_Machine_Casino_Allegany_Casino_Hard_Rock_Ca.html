    <h1>Newcastle Casino Richmond Casino Si Casino Michigan Slot Machine Casino Allegany Casino Hard Rock Ca</h1>

<p>In November, the Kenosha City Council in Wisconsin greenlighted a proposal of the Menominee Tribe and Hard Rock International which calls for the development of a new gaming and entertainment resort. The tabled project is planned to use some 60 acres of land, located on County Highway K, west of Interstate 94.</p>
<p>Now, the project continues to gain traction following a meeting of the Kenosha Common Council. The Council met on Wednesday this week and saw a majority of its members vote in favor of the project. With only six members voting against the project, a majority of 11 supported Hard Rock’s planned casino and entertainment resort.</p>
<p>This progress marked another important step toward the realization of the massive casino project that is estimated to have a price tag of nearly $400 million. Securing the approval of the Kenosha Common Council, the proposal will now seek another green light from the Kenosha County Board. The Board is expected to convene later this month, on January 16, and vote on the proposed project.</p>
<p>The Hard Rock Casino in Kenosha is expected to help create new workplaces, including jobs that will be available during the construction. The city itself would benefit from tax revenue, while the casino project is also expected to attract tourists, impacting positively local businesses.</p>
<p>Menominee Tribe Is Excited with the Progress of the Project</p>
<p>Gena Kakkak, chair of the Menominee Tribe, was excited about the recent approval the project secured, as announced in a report by Fox6. “We thank the City Council for its continued support for and confidence in the many positives that the Kenosha Hard Rock Casino will bring to the community,” she explained.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kakkak highlighted the efforts and support of Mayor John Antaramian for the proposal. Speaking about the benefits the new casino would bring, the Tribe’s chair said the project would create more than 1,000 new jobs and boost the local economy.</p>
<p>The price tag of the new project is estimated at $360 million. Besides the 1,000 permanent jobs, the construction of the casino which will last approximately 18 months will also create nearly 1,000 temporary workplaces. Annually, the project is estimated to welcome more than 2.4 million visitors with 1.6 million of that total arriving from other states.</p>
<p>Besides a Hard Rock Hotel with 150 rooms, the project will offer a massive gaming floor with 50 table games and a staggering 1,500 slot machines. Additional amenities visitors of the new venue can expect include a Hard Rock live entertainment venue, restaurants, bars and shopping outlets.</p>
