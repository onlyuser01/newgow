<p>ParlayBay has signed a distribution partnership with iGaming aggregation platform AzureTech. As a result, ParlayBay will be able to boost the reach of its dedicated sports betting products which will now be part of AzureTech’s platform which has a strong focus on the Asian market.</p>
<p>AzureTech to Give ParlayBay Market Boost</p>
<p>ParlayBay will benefit from the tie-up as it enables the company to access new audiences and expand its geographical footprint. The company will also have the opportunity to interpret player preferences and deliver products based on this. Commenting on this opportunity, ParlayBay CEO Patrick Nordwall said:</p>
<p>AzureTech is joining us on our journey to disrupt the iGaming market by enabling the distribution of our games to the Asian market. AzureTech’s extensive network of operators aids in a fast-time-to-market and is a sublime partner for our venture. ParlayBay CEO Patrick Nordwall</p>
<p>ParlayBay has a sizeable portfolio of options that are bound to appeal to Asian players and strike home with AzureTech’s network of top regional operators. ParlayBay brings games such as Streak, Gekko, Cut, Rush, and Boss to the fore.</p>
<p>Players will have access to numerous content offerings, such as basketball, volleyball, cricket, handball, and esports, which will be launched at AzureTech partners that are interested in the offer. Through this partnership, AzureTech and ParlayBay have the opportunity to transform the iGaming market by involving more sports-driven products.</p>
<p>Upending consumer expectations has already become a signature move with ParlayBay whose quality of top-tier games is now readily enjoyed by players globally. The products delivered by the company offer excellent UI/UX and come with lightning-fast gameplay.</p>
<p>ParlayBay’s Content to Help with AzureTech’s Offer</p>
<p>ParlayBay is well aware of what consumers are after and makes sure that its games come with popular features such as cashouts, rebuys, and even leaderboards for those more competitively-minded players.</p>
<p>AzureTech COO Cora Chen welcomed the opportunity and said that ParlayBet’s products are a great addition to the existing lineup of products already featured in the company. Through these new products, AzureTech is confident it will energize its own product offer and take it to new heights.</p>
<p>ParlayBay recently signed two new partnerships, with the company teaming up with FINNPLAY and INDIBET to bring its outstanding games for additional monetization and engagement opportunities.</p>
