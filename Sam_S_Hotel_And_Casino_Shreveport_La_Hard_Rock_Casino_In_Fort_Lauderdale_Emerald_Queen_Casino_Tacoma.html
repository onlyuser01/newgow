<p>The outgoing CEO was nominated to join the company's Board of Directors, with approval expected at the upcoming 2024 Annual General Meeting</p>
<p>The leading business-to-business provider of services and solutions, powering betting operators across the globe, Kambi Group, announced changes to its senior leadership. On Monday, the company confirmed that its co-founder and CEO, Kristian Nylén, intends to step down from his role. The CEO and co-founder notified the company’s Board of Directors, confirming that he plans to step down at some point this year, whenever a successor for the role is appointed.</p>
<p>Nylén co-founded Kambi together with Anders Ström back in 2010. Since then, he played an instrumental role, navigating the business through different obstacles and successfully achieving many important milestones that made Kambi a go-to supplier of sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>Besides the plans for the CEO to step down from his role, Kambi confirmed that its Nomination Committee proposed Nylén for election to the Board during the upcoming 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM).</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Ström, who serves as a chair of the Board, praised the efforts of Nylén that helped ensure Kambi is a leading provider for the growing betting sector. He spoke about the outgoing CEO’s dedication and commitment that helped the company achieve many milestones over the years. “I am delighted the Nomination Committee has proposed Kristian for the Board, where his extensive industry knowledge will continue to greatly benefit Kambi,” added Ström.</p>
<p>Nylén Was Instrumental for the Success of Kambi</p>
<p>He predicted that Nylén will continue to guide Kambi and help it create value for its shareholders. According to the Board’s chairman, Nylén’s shift to a Board position reaffirms his dedication as a major shareholder and founder of the company. Finally, Ström said that Kambi will start the search for a new CEO and vowed to deliver updates in due time.</p>
<p>“Kristian’s role has been critical in positioning Kambi as a frontrunner in our sector.“ Anders Ström, chair of the Board at Kambi</p>
<p>Nylén also commented on the topic explaining that the decision to leave his role at Kambi was a tough one. Yet, he confirmed his plans to spend more time with his family as a reason behind the difficult choice.</p>
<p>“The decision to stand down from my position at Kambi after so many enjoyable years has been difficult, but one predominantly driven by my desire to spend more time with my young and growing family.“ Kristian Nylén, co-founder and CEO of Kambi</p>
<p>Speaking about the proposal to join the company’s Board, Nylén said that it is an honor for him to accept this proposal. He outlined that he currently remains committed to helping Kambi continue to grow. Finally, Nylén explained that once he transitions to the role with the Board, his focus will shift toward the “strategic aspects” of the business.</p>
