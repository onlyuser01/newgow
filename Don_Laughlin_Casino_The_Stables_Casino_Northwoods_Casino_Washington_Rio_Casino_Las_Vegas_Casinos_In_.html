<p>The supplier of live casino products, OnAir Entertainment, has opened a new dedicated live studio in Romania. The studio will serve a dual purpose as the company will stream live casino games for both the Romanian and Italian markets and provide a robust selection of games and opportunities. This marks the 10th market in which the company has launched since it introduced its first live casino table game a little more than a year ago.</p>
<p>Among the games available in the new studio are Standard Blackjack, Eclipse Blackjack, and Standard Roulette which will now be managed from the new studio. OnAir Entertainment remains optimistic about the future as well, and the company is already planning to add more titles.</p>
<p>The games will be broadcast in Romanian, Italian, and English, OnAir Entertainment shared in the official press release. The studio is also planning on another table launch in March and is going to add ItalianEclipse Blackjack and ItalianStandard Roulette dedicated environments options later on.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment is similarly doubling down on the production of new games, bringing more worthwhile opportunities to players beyond these markets. Romania is not the last stop for the company either, as OnAir Entertainment is also looking to announce more business development in South Africa and Italy this year.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment Business Development Director Seval Kaya was very happy with the latest development and said that the entire team was "overjoyed" to be able to bring more customized games and unique live casino experiences to customers in Romania and Italy.</p>
<p>"Our service-minded approach combined with a strong game portfolio will be a great addition to the Romanian market," Kaya explained. The latest launch, Kaya noted, was achieved through the hard work of the internal teams who had made sure that they continue to deliver on outstanding results.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment has been in the news with its highly-personalized launches and business initiatives. For example, the company announced that it is launching a dedicated Dutch iGaming environment for the live casino sector in July. The company has IT hubs in several European countries, including Estonia, Poland, and Latvia,and also runs dedicated studios from Riga, Latviaâ€™s capital, and now, Bucharest, Romania.</p>
