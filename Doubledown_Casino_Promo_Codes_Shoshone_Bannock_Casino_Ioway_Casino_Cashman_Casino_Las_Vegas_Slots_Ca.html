<p>Tabcorp has revealed the latest version of its sports wagering app which will now be available to Australian sports bettors who may download it from the Google Play or Apple Store. The app is developed on the Flutter open source software and is considered a significant improvement on the old version, both in terms of user interface and user experience.</p>
<p>Tabcorp’s New App Is Faster, Better, Stronger</p>
<p>The new app is faster and makes it easier for sports bettors to place a wager, access a host of betting information, and benefit from additional features that have been smartly implemented into the app for the comfort and satisfaction of consumers. It’s also part of Tabcorp’s stronger commitment to improving and transforming its brand and unique market proposition.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new development, Tabcorp CEO Adam Rytenskild said that the new apps are part of the company’s improving strategy to elevate the sports betting experience for all of its customers. He added:</p>
<p>We want to be customer obsessed in everything we do, and this is the first of what will be regular upgrades of our app to transform the digital wagering experience for punters. Tabcorp CEO Adam Rytenskild</p>
<p>Even better, Rytenskild explained that the new app is based entirely on customer feedback and what they expect and have in mind when they access Tabcorp or any sportsbook, for that matter, through a handheld device.</p>
<p>Tabcorp will put a lot more effort into the regulation of the sports betting app and seek to constantly offer improvements that are driven by insight into consumer behavior and understanding consumer preferences. Tabcorp CCO Jenni Barnett also hailed the launch of the app and said that it will bring a “new era” to Tab customers.</p>
<p>“The new app is now live and we’re already working on upgrading it – there’s no set and forget for us,” she added. Barnett confirmed that Tabcorp will also be launching two new products before the year’s out.</p>
<p>Google’s Flutter open source software has also been instrumental in the development of the new apps, said Tabcorp CIO Alan Sharvin. In fact, the software makes it possible to quickly roll out new versions of the app, even on a bi-weekly basis, Sharvin said.</p>
<p>The Flutter software is one of the biggest brands and Tabcorp is excited to have leveraged its technology in Australia in order to improve the mobile betting experience.</p>
