<p>Pariplay, NeoGames’ aggregation platform and content provider, announced it has appointed Linda Sliede as Head of Account Management to support its global expansion strategy.</p>
<p>Growing and Developing People Internally</p>
<p>New appointment Slieda has more than five years of gaming industry experience and will report directly to Pariplay CCO Enrico Bradamente while performing her duties as Head of Account Management.</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment, Bradamante was more than delighted “to have been able to promote” Sliede who he believes has what it takes to propel the business by “growing and developing people internally.”</p>
<p>“At Pariplay we have a very strong team of Account Managers who are extremely customer focused,” he continued, looking forward to seeing Sliede’s contribution “to help Pariplay continue to push the boundaries in the industry.”</p>
<p>Sliede’s iGaming industry experience includes various roles at Euro Live Technologies, a company under the Playtech umbrella, where she served between March 2020 and November 2021, prior to joining Pariplay as an Account Manager.</p>
<p>This was Sliede’s second stint with Playtech as her career began as a Game Presenter with the gaming technology giant in May 2015 before becoming a customer service representative of the brand in Riga, Latvia, where she spent 14 months.</p>
<p>Her career also includes roles as PR and Project Manager with companies in her native Latvia, as well as freelance work as a Digital Marketing Manager and Strategist, before joining Playtech for the second time.</p>
<p>Facilitate Global Expansion Strategy</p>
<p>The appointment of the holder of BA of Audio Visual Media Arts from Riseba University in Latvia Sliede is expected to positively impact Pariplay’s expansion strategy across regulated gaming markets worldwide and especially in North America where the aggregator has already established significant partnerships.</p>
<p>Currently live in New Jersey and West Virginia in the US, Ontario and Alberta in Canada, the UK, Spain, Sweden, Bulgaria, Italy, Portugal, Denmark, Romania, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Germany in Europe, as well as Colombia in Latin America, Pariplay added in 2022 alone more than 20 new operator partners and has tripled its growth over the last three years.</p>
<p>Pariplay holds operating licenses in the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Michigan, while Connecticut became the fifth US-regulated gaming jurisdiction to authorize operations for the aggregator just days ago.</p>
<p>Also in October, Pariplay shook hands with ATG for a distribution deal that will extend the market reach of its Fusion aggregation platform in Sweden by bringing gaming content to players at the sports betting and horse racing local brand.</p>
