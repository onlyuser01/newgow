<p>Circa Las Vegas has created buzz downtown since opening amid the pandemic last October. Now the nation’s largest leisure travel agency has taken notice.</p>

<p>AAA recently sent a few unannounced inspectors to Circa to spend a couple of nights at the 777-room resort. The examiners liked what they found.</p>
<p>Circa, developed and owned by downtown Las Vegas visionary Derek Stevens, has announced that the property has received the distinguished AAA Four Diamond Award.</p>
<p>Stevens is the dominant player in downtown Las Vegas. Along with Circa, his company’s portfolio includes D Las Vegas, Golden Gate Hotel &amp; Casino, and Downtown Las Vegas Events Center.</p>
<p>Exclusive Company</p>
<p>Circa Las Vegas was the first from-the-ground-up casino resort to open downtown in 40 years. Downtown Las Vegas was already amid a revival of sorts prior to its opening, as gross gaming revenue (GGR) was steadily increasing, leading up to the pandemic. But Circa fueled additional visitor traffic downtown once it opened for business.</p>
<p>Circa’s Instagram-worthy features, such as its rooftop Stadium Club and world’s largest sportsbook, have better put the downtown area on the map. AAA says it’s worth the short taxi ride from the Strip.</p>
<p>According to the travel agency and insurer, only 6.5 percent of hotel properties inspected are granted Four Diamonds. Circa is the only hotel in downtown Las Vegas to receive the Four Diamond Award.</p>
<p>To qualify, hotels apply for review with the AAA. The agency then sends inspectors, unannounced and appearing as regular guests, to examine the hotel. To receive the Four Diamond Award, AAA explains that the hotel “must be upscale in all areas.”</p>
<p>Las Vegas Diamonds Shine Bright</p>
<p>Circa Las Vegas is the first and only downtown Las Vegas casino to be an accredited AAA Four Diamond property. But in Southern Nevada, it’s one of many.</p>
<p>Numerous popular Vegas resorts have four AAA diamonds, including Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, MGM Grand, The Cosmopolitan, The Venetian and Palazzo, Wynn and Encore, Palms, M Resort, and Red Rock.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is additionally home to six hotels that have achieved the highly exclusive Five Diamond distinction. AAA says just 0.4 percent of reviewed hotels meet the criteria to earn the highest-tiered rating.</p>
<p>The Five Diamond destinations in Las Vegas are Aria, Aria Sky Suites, Bellagio, Waldorf Astoria, Four Seasons, and Wynn Tower Suites.</p>
