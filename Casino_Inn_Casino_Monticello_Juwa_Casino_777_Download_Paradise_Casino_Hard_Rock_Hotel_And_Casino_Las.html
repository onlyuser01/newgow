<p>The 2012-founded leading technology company that offers iGaming products, services, and solutions to operators, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), has announced that its multiple-award-winning platform will support Goldenpark’s entrance into Ontario’s regulated online gaming market.</p>
<p>The decision represents an expansion of the solid partnership that already exists between the two parties.</p>
<p>Goldenpark’s First Deal Out of the Iberian Peninsula</p>
<p>Similar to the platform agreement deal inked in August between GiG and Mooir eGaming with the purpose of supporting the up-and-coming iGaming brand’s growth, the new GiG-Goldenpark agreement will help the latter harness the technology company’s rich experience in North America while promoting its overall expansion.</p>
<p>GiG has already signed five important partnerships in Ontario that have either already gone live or are in the process of seeing the light of day. This means Goldenpark can expect to leverage GiG’s expertise to develop and provide premium, localized, and fully customizable customer experiences. The freshly announced decision will also mark Goldenpark’s first deal outside the Iberian peninsula.</p>
<p>As explained by GiG’s chief commercial officer, Marcel Elfersy, GiG, in its quality of “a valued existing partner,” is delighted to be able to carry Goldenpark into the North American territory for the first time in history. Elfersy described the new agreement as a “testament to the strength and flexibility” of their offerings as well as further proof of their bond with Goldenpark that allows them to successfully explore and develop new opportunities together.</p>
<p>More Than “Just a Geographical Expansion”</p>
<p>As explained by José Giacomelli, general manager of the online division of MGA since 2001, one of Goldenpark’s greatest challenges for the upcoming year is to launch its operations on the Ontarian market.</p>
<p>Giacomelli added that the Ontario market, which was launched in April 2022, and has since generated an estimated $26.41 billion in total wagers within 15 months, currently represents “a vibrant and rapidly growing market” that should help them meet their goals alongside GiG. He further explained the new agreement as more than a simple expansion at a geographical level, calling it an “evolution in how both companies envision the future, seize opportunities, and tackle challenges.”</p>
<p>Finally, the GM reinstated their main goal to cater to the needs of their customers by delivering premium solutions, something that the new agreement is expected to help them achieve even better.</p>
<p>GiG currently has access to more than 30 regulated markets with eight more currently in development through interesting partnerships, placing brand control in the hands of operators for the first time.</p>
<p>At the end of August, Merkur and GiG confirmed an extension of their compliance partnership.</p>
