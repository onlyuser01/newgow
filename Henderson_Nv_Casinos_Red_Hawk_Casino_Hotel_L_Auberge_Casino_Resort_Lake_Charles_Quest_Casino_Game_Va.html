    <h1>Henderson Nv Casinos Red Hawk Casino Hotel L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Quest Casino Game Va</h1>

<p>I've been playing at this casino for about a month, so far my experience has actually been quite positive. Up to the time when I requested the first payout (500â‚¬). I was asked to upload my documents for verification, which I did. The next day my account was closed and I couldn't log in anymore.</p>
<p>I only found out the reason when I asked support: In the terms and conditions it is written that I paid money from an account that is not registered in my name. That's also true, I used a family member's credit card because the deposit from my card failed multiple times. Since I violated the terms and conditions, all of my winnings and deposits will now be withheld. That means several hundred euros that I paid in over the month are simply retained with reference to a small clause in the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I have the feeling that this rule in the terms and conditions only exists to be able to deduct customers. The support does not respond to my questions, I received the reason (a copy of the terms and conditions) once and then only repeated the one-liner:</p>
<p>The decision is final.</p>
<p>I feel cheated by this casino. In my opinion, that's theft. I don't get my deposits back, not even partially.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any support in this case.</p>
