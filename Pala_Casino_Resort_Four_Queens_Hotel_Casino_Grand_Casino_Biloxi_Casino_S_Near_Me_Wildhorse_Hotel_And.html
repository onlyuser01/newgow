<p>Magic Money Maze review</p>
<p>Prepare for a prestigious world occupied by American presidents of days gone by.</p>
<p>Magic Money Maze is a cash-themed slot where the historical faces from the bills come to life along with plenty of green imagery. If players can navigate the mazes of this slot, they might walk away with some historical faces in their pockets.</p>
<p>Players looking for an elegant atmosphere and plenty of money-oriented imagery might especially enjoy this slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The cheerful soundtrack brings to mind patriotic marches and festive parades. A shimmering sound accompanies spins, adding magical flair.</p>
<p>The reels have golden frames, with coins and green bills tumbling from all sides. This provides a sense of abundance and makes this slot’s cash theme clear.</p>
<p>Among the symbols players will find the iconic faces of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Benjamin Franklin as they appear on American currency. However, each of these men are animated in full color, giving them life as characters.</p>
<p>An array of stylized letters also appear on the reels in jewel tones of red, pink, green, and blue with gold detailing.</p>
<p>During the Bonus mode, the slot aesthetic is altered as the reels are transformed into a game board-like grid. Here, a crowned-monkey makes its way through a maze of obstacles and rewards. Dodging predatory snakes and scorpions, this little ape seeks out hearts, money, and the presidents themselves.</p>
<p>Together, the animation and soundtrack create a unique world of cash and intrigue.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Magic Money Maze is a five-reel, three-row slot with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>The maximum win is 10,000x players’ total bet.</p>
<p>If players wish, they can buy directly into the Bonus (see further details below).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Money symbol takes on a different value for each spin selected from a predetermined set. If 5 Money symbols land together, players are awarded the total value of all the Money symbols.</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol appears on all the reels and when players land 3 or more, the Bonus feature begins. The number of ‘lives’ awarded depends on the number of Bonus symbols that triggered the feature as follows:</p>
<p>3 Bonus symbols = 1 life</p>
<p>4 Bonus symbols = 2 lives</p>
<p>5 Bonus symbols = 4 lives</p>
<p>The Bonus is played on a special 7x7 set of reels and starts with a Monkey Head placed in a random position at the edge of the reels. Other randomly placed items also appear on the reels, including money awards, Hearts, Scorpions, and Snakes.</p>
<p>Next, dice are rolled and reveal between 1 and 6 dots, deciding how many positions the Monkey Head will move on the grid. Depending on where the Monkey Head lands, payouts between 0.1x and 1000x the player’s total bet may be awarded.</p>
<p>Landing on Scorpions or Snakes costs the player lives, but a life can be granted by landing on a Heart. However, a maximum of 3 lives can be collected.</p>
<p>When the Monkey Head lands on a Present Portrait for the first time, the President Portrait is collected. Each additional time a President Portrait is collected, a progressively increasing multiplier is also awarded.</p>
<p>Any time the Monkey Head lands at the center of the grid, a multiplier is applied to the random money awards.</p>
<p>The Bonus ends when players run out of lives.</p>
