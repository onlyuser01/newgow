    <h1>Miami Ok Casino Detroit Casino Strike Palm Springs Casinos Hollywood Casino Hotel Joliet Gran Casino</h1>

<p>Hello Silvia,</p>
<p>My name is Liz and I am the VIP Manager of Cobra casino. Hope you're doing well!</p>
<p>I have checked your case and your communication with our agents and the documentation you have provided.</p>
<p>Please, firstly allow me to explain how payment providers/method work and perhaps this will be more helpful.</p>
<p>The transactions entered the account profile are out of our control - the Casino has payment methods that are presented in the deposit page based on the license its operating and sometimes the payment methods can have issues, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I have checked your deposit and can see that unfortunately, as you stated it's not successful. You have been advised by our agents that within maximum 10 business days funds will return, and if not that you must contact us with a bank statement, so we can escalate further to the payment provider.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes due to network issues and further technical queries, the transaction can be taken out of the bank account, but NOT credited in the casino. It's never lost - as it cannot be lost, but it must be traced, if it's held by the bank (your bank), by the provider(payment provider), or it's just stuck between sources before being credited.</p>
<p>I will be happy if you send your bank statement since the day of the deposit until the end of the month to vip@cobracasino.com</p>
<p>We will escalate immediately to our payment provider for further investigation and tracing the funds.</p>
<p>Please, note that the funds are not lost and we will do our best to help you receive them - money cannot be lost and we will cooperate so they can be returned.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please send the document to vip@cobracasino.com or contact us via livechat and ask for Liz the VIP Manager - you will be transferred to me and I will further cooperate.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Liz</p>
