    <h1>Los Angeles Casinos Gibson Casino Casino Arizona Jobs Casino Norfolk Va World Class Casino BETBY Int</h1>

<p>BETBY has signed a new partnership with Aposta Ganha, a Brazilian brand, to launch its Betby.Games content</p>
<p>This marks the latest expansion in the Latin American region for the supplier of sportsbook technology and innovative tech solutions.</p>
<p>Aposta Ganha Happy to Give Content a Solid Boost</p>
<p>Through this partnership. BETBY will leverage a number of its esports products and bring them to local fans in Brazil. Among the titles that Aposta Ganha will now be able to offer to its players are Rocket League, NBA 2K, eFighting, and Cricket.</p>
<p>Betby.Games covers more than 100,000 live events per month and feature more than 250 betting markets. This means that Aposta Ganha users will have an extensive collection of opportunities to wager on.</p>
<p>The solution is also lightweight enough and easy to integrate directly into sportsbook platforms without adding traction to the overall functionality of the sportsbook, thus enabling partners to launch with fresh and engaging markets right away.</p>
<p>BETBY’s partnership with the Brazilian operator is also another significant step forward in Latin America where the company wishes to establish a firmer geographic footprint. BETBY CCO Chris Nikolopoulos hailed the opportunity to launch BETBY.Games Esports content range with a new operator, saying:</p>
<p>As we continue our geographical expansion, we’re thrilled to partner with Aposta Ganha, an operator with a strong presence in Brazil. BETBY CCO Chris Nikolopoulos</p>
<p>Aposta Ganha head of products Elvis Lourenco was similarly pleased to welcome the new products and said that they were set to benefit the company immensely. “We are delighted to bring [this product] live on our casino brand,” Lourneco explained.</p>
<p>BETBY Continues to Build upon Existing Momentum</p>
<p>Through this tie-up with BETBY, Lourneco assured that his company continues to provide players with some of the best possible options. BETBY has achieved significant efforts over the past months, and the company is determined to continue growing its offer and product in 2023.</p>
<p>To achieve this, BETBY announced that it has set up a new office in Montenegro, a precursor for its anticipated successes this year. BETBY has signed an equally-important partnership a couple of months ago. Established with STATSCORE, this partnership is intended to significantly improve the reach of BETBY’s tech and benefit from STATSCORE’s own technological capabilities.</p>
