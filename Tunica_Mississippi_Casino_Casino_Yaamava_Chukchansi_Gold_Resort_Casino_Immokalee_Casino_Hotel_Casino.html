    <h1>Tunica Mississippi Casino Casino Yaamava Chukchansi Gold Resort Casino Immokalee Casino Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>The award-winning iGaming platform and sportsbook solutions provider, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced today that it inked a new head of terms agreement with Crab Sports, the US-based sports betting brand.</p>
<p>Crab Sports and GiG Ink Head of Terms Agreement</p>
<p>The terms of the collaboration will see GiG provide its innovative platform and sportsbook solution for Crab Sports in Maryland. Legalized in mid-May last year, the sports betting market in Maryland was launched a few months later in December. The state authorized the activity to be offered by commercial casinos, racetracks and sports arenas, but currently, it remains limited to retail outlets only. Regardless, the popularity of sports betting continues to grow and the market in the country is expected to generate some $217 million in revenue after its first year.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to have partnered with Crab Sports. We see great potential in the Crab Sports excellent team and local approach and we see great potential in Maryland.“ Richard Brown, CEO at GiG</p>
<p>GiG’s CEO, Richard Brown, said that it is delightful to join forces with Crab Sports. He explained that GiG acknowledges the potential that the market in Maryland holds and the great potential of Crab Sports’ dedicated team. Brown added that the company is looking forward to collaborating with Crab Sports. He predicted that the partnership will bring benefits to the duo.</p>
<p>GiG Expects to See Positive Contributions Starting from Q4 2022</p>
<p>The recent deal marks another major milestone after GiG’s combination with Sportnco. It was back in December last year when GiG announced its plans to acquire the leading platform provider of turnkey betting and gaming solutions. Then, this year in April, the company completed the Sportnco acquisition. With that in mind, Brown added that the deal with Crab Sports marks a “proud moment for us and highlights the faith we have in the synergies between GiG and Sportnco.”</p>
<p>Overall, Crab Sports’ leadership team has more than two decades of online gaming experience. Now, the new collaboration will see the company leverage GiG’s innovative solutions. According to GiG, the full contract with Crab Sports is expected to be signed in the upcoming months. The company said that it anticipates seeing positive contributions from the partnership starting from Q4, 2022.</p>
