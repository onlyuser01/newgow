<p>The Ontario private iGaming and sports betting market has come full circle with the jurisdiction, one of the most populous in the North American gambling market, now planning on some important changes to better protect youth and children from exposure to gambling advertisements.</p>
<p>To this end, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), the gambling regulator, has now proposed changes to the existing Advertising Standards that would seek to minimize potential harm experienced by the aforementioned groups. These proposals are based on the regulator’s careful examination of existing gambling advertisement practices, with the watchdog concluding that the persons who are featured in commercials and promotional materials may in fact appeal to individuals below the legal gaming age.</p>
<p>The people in question have to do with celebrities and athletes, and AGCO is worried about the negative impact this may have on underage persons, deeming the risk high. In other words, AGCO wants to now see if there is sufficient support for changing the Advertising Standards so that the image and likeness of active and retired athletes, as well as celebrities that appeal to children and youth, could be prohibited.</p>
<p>Basically, the proposal would seek to cease collaborations between operators and active or retired athletes as well as avoid featuring cartoon figures, role models, social media influencers, celebrities, or entertainers that will appeal to minors in any capacity. The proposal is comprehensive and very much aligned with a high standard of consumer protection that is becoming the norm globally.</p>
<p>This would come as a serious and important change to the advertisement code of conduct and raise standards across the board. AGCO will be accepting public input until May 8, 2023. The regulator is similarly interested in engaging with a range of stakeholders who would be able to offer their opinion and provide evidence why the approach may succeed or conversely – why it may prove too restrictive.</p>
<p>AGCO is already planning as well. Should it pass new Advertising Standards, the regulator already prepares for a grace period which would give stakeholders, such as operators and suppliers, sufficient time to comply. The measures should be complied with within a three-month period from the date of making these new standards official on AGCO’s website.</p>
<p>Ontario has also been one of the best-protected online gaming markets, not least owing to companies such as GeoComply.</p>
