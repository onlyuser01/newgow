<p>With the official launch date of sports betting in Ohio fast approaching, another major player, Sportradar, announced today it received permission to operate in the state.</p>
<p>Ready to Launch Operations</p>
<p>Sportradar Group AG announced that its US subsidiary Sportradar Solutions LLL has obtained a Sports Gaming Supplier License from the Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC).</p>
<p>Sportradar expects to commence operations in Ohio alongside the official sports betting market launch scheduled for January 1, 2023, further expanding its footprint in the US and North America.</p>
<p>Provider of sports data, technology, content, and integrity services Sportradar holds 41 licenses or permissions to operate in the US and Canada, including states, territories, tribes and provinces, serving a wide range of business customers operating within these jurisdictions, advancing transparency and protecting integrity within sports for its sports betting and gaming partners.</p>
<p>Last month, Sportradar received the “Data Service Provider of the Year” award at the American Gambling Awards for its key role in delivering trusted data and technology to the sports betting and gaming industry.</p>
<p>Covering more than 890,000 events across 92 sports annually, Sportradar stands out as one of the leaders in sports data distribution, partnering with leagues and competitions, including the NHL, MLB, NBA, NASCAR, FIFA, ICC, ITF, and UEFA among others.</p>
<p>Preparations to Go Live</p>
<p>Sportradar became the latest company to receive a license to commence operations in Ohio, coming shortly after Canadian sportsbook supplier Elys Game Technology and geolocation technology provider Xpoint.</p>
<p>Elys Game Technology announced last month it has been granted conditional approval to launch betting transactions from day one, for five years, subject to obtaining all further required certifications and licensing.</p>
<p>Also in November, provider of geolocation and compliance solutions Xpoint received authorization to offer its services to operators in Ohio and help them comply with regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>And while some of the players are lining up to launch from day one, others already began operations one way or another.</p>
<p>Last month, Tipico announced the launch of a free-to-play game as part of its preparation to go live with regular sports betting in the state, Stoke-on-Trent-based bet365 announced a pre-launch promotion, while Caesars Sportsbook began early player registration the month before.</p>
