    <h1>Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel Eagle Pass Tx Estados Unidos Hotels Near Choctaw Casino Durant Ok</h1>

<p>Hello Nick,</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>I understand in regards to some casinos not self excluding/blocking due to the software that they have or the fact that they may not operate that service. I have came across that issue before when I emailed for self exclusion and received a response "we do not offer self exclusion unless an account already exists within our site. Viewing our records you have no account with us, therefore we cannot self exclude you" or words to that effect.</p>
<p>Then, I have had other casinos stating they would be able to use this information to block if I attempted to sign up with the information I provided via email. I do understand that Casinos differ which is unfortunate but such is life.</p>
<p>In regards to this certain issue that I have with QBet, you have stated that "Unfortunately, there isnâ€™t written that all your accounts in other casinos of the same owner/license will be blocked or self-excluded automatically."</p>
<p>In response to that, their License, Gaming Curacao, Government of Curacao and operates under the Master License of Gaming Services Provider, N.V. #365/JAZ as an Information Service Provider, who I contacted and received a response from (and I attached that information in the first email) stated that they would contact all their licensee's with regards to the self exclusion/blocking/blacklisting of my information.</p>
<p>After receiving that email, there are sites that still operate under the above license that allowed me to sign up. When I sent the email attachment from Gaming Curacao, I received refunds from those sites (again attached in the original email), and my information was again self excluded/blocked/blacklisted.</p>
<p>The license holder defines who can operate their site and therefore holds more weight. Thus instead of contacting each seperate casino individually I went straight to the source and received the response that my information would be passed along to the licensee's for the required request.</p>
<p>No contact was made with QBet because contact was made with the license operator who had stated my information for self exclusion/blocking/blacklisting would be passed along and yet QBet allowed the opening of the account. There may have been an electronic error/system error or human error but there was definitely an error somewhere that allowed me to sign up to their site after receiving in writing, from their license holder, that I would not be allowed to sign up.</p>
<p>I hope this information helps and if I need to send on that information again please let me know.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
