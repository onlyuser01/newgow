<p>Betknowmore Global and leading outsourcing business Everett Sky are delighted to announce an exciting groundbreaking partnership. This new initiative will address the human resources and recruitment needs of the gambling sector by developing and promoting the services of Everett Sky’s safer gambling solution.</p>
<p>The service allows operators to build teams of safer gambling, compliance, and customer service analysts - across multiple time zones, 24/7 and in a variety of languages both over the phone or via online/live chat.</p>
<p>Everett Sky’s solution also ensures that the people are trained to the standards and software used by operators and managed effectively - essentially becoming an outsourced part of the in-house team which will relieve pressures on resources during ever-changing times in the industry.</p>
<p>Betknowmore Global are a leading provider of gambling training services which embrace the insight and knowledge of ‘Experts by Experience’ combined with evidence-based approaches. Through their suite of training, they have established a wide range of contacts throughout the gambling sector and are able to leverage those relationships to signpost Everett Sky and help operators keep on top of managing their safer gambling responsibilities and ensure customers remain safe and within their limits.</p>

<p>"We are absolutely delighted to finalise this partnership with Betknowmore. Ever since our first conversation, I have been hugely impressed with the passion and knowledge of the sector held by Frankie, Ben, and the wider team. They have been a pleasure to deal with, and this partnership marks a significant moment for us. With the ever-changing landscape within the betting and gaming sector creating pressures on talent and resource, our safer gambling team solution can help operators scale their teams and add capacity across their markets.</p>
<p>"With the added expertise of Betknowmore’s fantastic training and development, our solution is now even stronger. I am excited to see the partnership develop in the months and years ahead and look forward to working with operators to develop their teams to achieve what we are all aiming for - a safer gambling experience for players."</p>
<p>Director of Commercial Affairs at Betknowmore Global Ben Davies:</p>
<p>"It is a great pleasure to be working alongside the team at Everett Sky. It’s clear to see that Phil and the team have a real passion and drive for improving safer gambling standards within the industry.
