<p>Canadian iGaming leader Kings Entertainment Group has joined forces with Native Ads for a new marketing campaign. Per the agreement, the New York-based agency will help the operator engage its customers with customized digital advertisements.</p>
<p>Kings Entertainment Hires Native Ads for an Ad Campaign</p>
<p>Native Ads will leverage its capabilities to create a new digital marketing campaign for its new client. Its job will be to promote the operator’s products and spread awareness of its offerings. As announced by the two parties, the new campaign will run for a whole year, thus helping Kings Entertainment’s content reach more bettors.</p>
<p>It was announced that the entire campaign will cost around $146,445 to make and distribute. This cost will include the creation of promotional content, search engine optimization and the distribution of the ads.</p>
<p>The campaign will launch later this quarter and will continue for twelve months. The exact timelines are still being discussed by the operator and Native Ads and will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>The Campaign’s Timing Is Perfect, Budin Says</p>
<p>Kings Entertainment hopes that the new campaign will help its products gain traction. The company seeks to build familiarity and brand awareness by promoting its products across the digital space. Depending on the program’s success, Kings Entertainment might decide to extend the program. Depending on the performance, the operator might also opt to provide the program with a higher budget.</p>
<p>The chief executive director of Kings Entertainment, Steve Budin, believes that the campaign’s timing could not have been better. He shared that his team is thrilled to join Native Ads, which it considers to be an “international leader in digital marketing.”</p>
<p>Budin explained that Kings Entertainment’s primary goal is to leverage the current momentum of his company’s fan-favorite brands and further bolster it with a comprehensive digital campaign.</p>
<p>Kings Entertainment operates popular gambling brands such as LottoKings and WinTrillions. The Canadian gambling juggernaut is steadily expanding its global business with key strategic moves, such as the recent M&amp;A deal with Sports Venture Holdings. In late September this year, the operator conditional approval from the Canadian Securities Exchange, allowing it to proceed with the monumental deal.</p>
<p>The SVH agreement is several months in the making and was first announced in May when Kings Entertainment unveiled the merger plans. SVH notably operates Bet99, which is one of the largest casino and sports betting brands in Canada. The deal, therefore, means a lot for Kings Entertainment, which will be able to further expand its business.</p>
