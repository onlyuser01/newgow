<p>Gaming giant Penn National has extended its partnership with NASCAR and signed a new agreement to become an authorized gaming partner for the league.</p>
<p>NASCAR and Penn National Gaming Team Up in Kansas</p>
<p>On Friday, Penn National Gaming said that it is teaming up with NASCAR ahead of the upcoming racing season and Daytona 500, the most venerated of moto races in the United States. As a result of the partnership, Penn will be the “authorized gaming operator” for the entire series moving forward, marking the deal a first gambling partnership for the sports organization.</p>

<p>Based in Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Penn’s Hollywood Casino offers the perfect spot for fans of the racing event to come for a quick wager as they overlook the raceway. More importantly, Hollywood Casino 400 has won an extended partnership with the NASCAR Cup Series through 2026, guaranteeing fans of motorsports a safe haven where they can bet and enjoy their favorite races.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest developments, Hollywood Casino 400 president Patrick Warren said that the company was excited to have extended the partnership. He further said:</p>
<p>“Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway has been able to entertain thousands of their customers, not only from the Kansas City area, but also from around the country during the Hollywood Casino 400 the last several years.”</p>
<p>The footprint of Penn National is equally impressive with properties in 19 states and estimated 41 casinos, each one of which holds the potential of affiliating itself with the NASCAR Cup Series or the feeder league, the Xfinity Series.</p>
<p>The NASCAR partnership is not a chance deal either. The gaming giant has focused on adding sports leagues so that it can boost its digital and retail product, including the yet-to-be-launched betting app.</p>
<p>A partnership with NASCAR has been a logical step given the unique location of Hollywood Casino 400 which has served as a preferred venue for many NASCAR fans in Kansas. Meanwhile, NASCAR has been looking into other ways to monetize amid falling viewership numbers for the races.</p>
<p>A complete overhaul of the schedule and format is also underway with certain changes already applying for the 2020/2021 season. In 2019, NASCAR also signed a data partnership with Genius Sports.</p>
<p>NASCAR VP of Innovation Craig Neeb has also expressed his excitement at the deal with Penn National, arguing that the partnership allows NASCAR to position itself in the quickly expanding sector of legal sports betting:</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to have Penn National on board as our first authorized gaming operator to strengthen our effort to increase fan engagement with a platform perfect for in-play experience.”</p>
<p>To kickstart the partnership between the two companies, Penn National is offering a $50,00 jackpot on every race through its NASCAR Finish Line, an exclusive product developed to raise awareness for NASCAR races, just the thing the motorsports organization needs right now.</p>
<p>Neeb added that the organization was excited to provide NASCAR fans with various outlets of their “fandom,” including the opportunity to place a wager and turn a profit off a beloved sport.</p>
