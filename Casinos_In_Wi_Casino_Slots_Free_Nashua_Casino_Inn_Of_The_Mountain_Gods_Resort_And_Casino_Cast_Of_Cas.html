<p>The Meadowlands Exposition Center in New Jersey has opened its gates to visitors attending the SBC Summit North America. One of the leading iGaming and sports betting events in North America is scheduled from May 9 to May 11. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to attend and explore the latest developments in the North American gambling markets in person.</p>
<p>The official program of the event began on Tuesday, May 9 with the Player Protection Symposium taking place at The Altman Building in New York City. Today, the action has shifted to New Jersey where the main part of SBC Summit North America opened to a wider audience still.</p>
<p>Five conference rooms are home to presentations and panel discussions covering the casino and sports betting markets, affiliates, marketing, emerging tech, investments, and anything else happening in the industry. Specifically, today’s conference rooms are focused on these areas:</p>
<p>SBC Leaders</p>
<p>Sports Betting Product</p>
<p>iGaming Americas</p>
<p>Marketing &amp; Affiliates</p>
<p>Emerging Tech &amp; Investments</p>
<p>The day’s highlights include a panel titled "Early Success Stories – Marketing &amp; Affiliate Leaders," where leaders from big affiliate companies discussed the opportunities and challenges in newly opening regulated US markets. Meanwhile, panelists at "Ontario iGaming – The Growth Phase" will discuss the future of a recently opened regulated iGaming market in Canada’s most populous province.</p>
<p>So far, sports betting seems to be getting more coverage than iGaming, which is expected with the regulatory status of the two markets across the US and Canada. That said, the conference is far from over. Both segments – and more – will be further discussed at tens of panels over the remainder of today’s agenda, as well as tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s agenda shifts slightly to include areas like converging worlds and new markets, payments, fintech, and more.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are over 60 companies promoting their products and services on the exhibition floor. The list includes affiliates, operators, media companies, payment providers, agencies, service providers, and more.</p>
<p>Casino Guru News is proud to be a Media Sponsor of SBC events, including the SBC Summit North America. Stay tuned for more updates from industry events and everything else happening in the industry.</p>
