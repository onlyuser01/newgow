    <h1>Funzpoints Casino App Download For Android Hotels And Casinos In Arizona Horseshoe Casino Southern I</h1>

<p>Australia’s Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has issued a warning to Proxous Advanced Solutions. According to ACMA, Proxous knowingly provided its Realtime Gaming software products to 13 illegal online casinos and thus, it breached the country’s 2001 Interactive Gambling Act.</p>
<p>Proxous Breaches the Rules for the First Time in Its History</p>
<p>This breach does not represent the first time in which Proxous is not adhering to the rules, something ACMA noted will not be tolerated. An investigation by the watchdog concluded that the 13 casinos that were supplied with the RTG software products, provided customers with illegal online gambling services.</p>
<p>ACMA also added that the casino sites in question relied on the RTG software products and noted that actions have been taken to make sure that they are blocked.</p>
<p>The casinos in question are Reels Of Joy, Fair Go Casino, Ozwin Casino, Two Up Casino, Aussie Play, Free Spin, Play Croco, BoVegas, Cherry Gold Casino, Uptown Pokies, Red Dog Casino, Slots Empire, and Uptown Aces.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this marks the first time in which ACMA issues a formal warning to a company that is involved in illegal gambling activities by supplying software solutions. In its statement, Australia’s watchdog said that customers should be aware of which sites they access because even though the casino site may seem “legitimate,” it is highly likely that it lacks the tools to ensure customer protection that is required from licensed platforms.</p>
<p>ACMA Has Blocked More Than 170 Companies Since 2017</p>
<p>Since 2017, the watchdog has blocked 170 companies that are looking to provide Aussie customers with illegal gambling services. Most recently, the ACMA issued a formal warning to Dama N.V under section 64A of the Interactive Gambling Act.</p>
<p>On January 10, 2022, ACMA started an investigation into whether the Megaslot service by Dama N.V has provided customers with illegal gambling services.</p>
<p>The investigation concluded that the Megaslot service provided Aussie players with various gambling services, including games of chance, games of skill, and games of mixed chance. Customers played for real money and the service had an “Australian customer-link.”</p>
<p>In its report, ACMA concluded that “Dama N.V. has contravened subsection 15(2A) of the IGA” and provided Australian-based customers with illegal gambling services.</p>
<p>With the warning, ACMA made it clear that all gambling companies, even the most reputable ones, need to adhere to the industry standards. Most recently, the watchdog made sure that the gambling industry in the country is safe by announcing BetStop, a self-exclusion register for mobile and online gambling.</p>
<p>BetStop will allow players to register and self-exclude from all licensed online casinos in Australia for a minimum of three months. Nerida O’Loughlin, ACMA’s chair, stated that thanks to BetStop, people that are experiencing gambling harm will be able to take control of the current situation and use the best solution at hand.</p>
