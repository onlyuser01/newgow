<p>The content launch with the Spanish operator is the latest in a series of launches for Bragg in 2023, both in Europe and the Americas</p>
<p>Online casino technology provider Bragg Gaming Group announced its reach in Spain has significantly extended after a new content deal with Gran Madrid|Casino Online.</p>
<p>Extending Spanish Presence</p>
<p>The agreement reached with Gran Madrid|Casino Online will see a rollout of Bragg’s gaming content into the platform of the Spanish-based online casino operator, offering its players a portfolio of feature-rich and engaging titles developed in-house and by Bragg’s exclusive studio partners.</p>
<p>Lara Falzon, president and chief operating officer of Bragg Gaming, commented on the arrangement, delighted to have launched content with Gran Madrid|Casino Online and be able to provide “a broad and rich portfolio of exclusive and high-quality casino titles” that she is certain would appeal to Spanish players.</p>
<p>This latest rollout is part of our ambitious growth plans for the year as we look to continue our expansion across key regulated European markets and beyond. Lara Falzon, president &amp; CEO, Bragg Gaming</p>
<p>Falzon hinted that Bragg’s expansion across European gaming jurisdictions is set to continue.</p>
<p>The content agreement would help Bragg significantly extend its presence in Spain, a major European market with strategic importance which is estimated by H2 Gambling Capital to reach a worth of $628 billion this year.</p>
<p>Boosting Product Offering</p>
<p>For Gran Madrid|Casino Online, the addition of Bragg’s gaming content will help boost the attractiveness of Spain’s first online casino operator, which has been continuously growing its digital offering and appeal to local players since 2011 when it acquired its online casino license.</p>
<p>On behalf of Gran Madrid|Casino Online, country manager José Félix Herreros commented on the content deal, focusing on its expected positive impact on the company’s business dealings in the local market and Europe.</p>
<p>The addition of Bragg’s comprehensive range of titles enables us to boost our offering and provide our customers with unique gaming experiences. José Félix Herreros, country manager, Gran Madrid|Casino Online,</p>
<p>“As we continue to grow our brand, we highly value this strategically important collaboration with Bragg, a leading provider in the iGaming space,” he concluded.</p>
<p>The deal with Gran Madrid|Casino Online is the latest in a string of arrangements announced by the Canadian-based gaming technology provider in 2023, including with Pasino.ch and Swiss Casinos in Switzerland, Gamomat in Italy, Napoleon Sports and Casino in Belgium, and others.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming was also active outside of Europe by launching content with Rush Street Interactive (RSI) in Pennsylvania, Caesars Entertainment and DraftKings in New Jersey, and Caliente Interactive in Mexico, among others, maintaining its upward growth trajectory.</p>
