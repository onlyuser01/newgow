<p>Top 3 Players Take Home 7-Figure Prize</p>
<p>Overall, the $250,000 Super High Roller wasn‚Äôt a crowded event, considering that it accumulated 33 entries. However, the $250,000 buy-in generated a hefty $8,217,000 prize pool. To win the tournament, Mateos proved to be the best player out of all thirty entries. Unlike other WSOP events, the Super High Roller featured prizes only for the top 5 players. With that in mind, only the top 3 players received a prize above a million dollars.</p>
<p>Keith Tilston was the player that took 5th place and collected a $632,124 prize. He was followed by Seth Davies, who was eliminated next and took 4th place. Davies took home some $930,781 prize, just shy of $1 million. On the other hand, John Kincaid was the player that ranked 3rd. Kincaid got some with a $1,370,575 prize.</p>
<p>In the end, the heads-up battle was between Mateos and Ben Heath. Although initially, the chip advantage wasn‚Äôt that big, Mateos quickly worked around and won more chips. In the end, it was Heath‚Äôs pair of fives that didn‚Äôt stand against Mateos‚Äô pair of queens. As a result, Heath hit the rail, taking 2nd place and collecting a $2,018,148 prize.</p>
<p>The Tournament Win Marks and Exciting Moment for the Spanish Pro</p>
<p>Mateos shared his excitement in an interview for Pokernews. He outlined that winning a big buy-in event like this one means a lot for him. Although Mateos has participated in $100,000 and even $1 million buy-in tournaments, he said that winning such an event was on his list.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was lucky enough and played well enough to win.‚Äù Adrian Mateos</p>
<p>Now that he has won the tournament, he revealed that he played well but he was also lucky. Mateos added that in order to win, he had to adapt to the game. According to him, this is mainly needed because of the small field of entries in the tournament. Mateos stressed that for him ‚Äúit‚Äôs more of a mental challenge to win these tournaments.‚Äù</p>
