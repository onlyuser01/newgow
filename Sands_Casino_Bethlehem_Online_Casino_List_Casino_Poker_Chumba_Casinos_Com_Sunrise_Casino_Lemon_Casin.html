    <h1>Sands Casino Bethlehem Online Casino List Casino Poker Chumba Casinos Com Sunrise Casino Lemon Casin</h1>

<p>I don't believe it matters to you, but it does matter to me. This forum does not cooperate with casinos. Do you know how many admins are there? How many people are you accusing of some fraud? It's technically just me. For quite a long time I was the only admin/moderator supporting the forum, the second one is still Daniel, who takes care of other aspects of community work. Thus he was mostly unaware of the forum.</p>
<p>The latest two guys are trainees - they are out of this question.</p>
<p>Hear me well when I say I do not work for any casino. I take care of the forum.</p>
<p>I believe I explained why the email was so important. But it does not matter now. Because you can't keep your nerves - proven several times even here on the forum as well, we have no obligation to let anybody abuse us. Instead, we usually invest the time and money - (yes the money - complaints are free for players to submit, but the manpower behind those needs their wages) to those who are capable of normal cooperation.</p>
<p>You've given us all in Casino Guru "many names", that's intolerable. Yes, you are most likely to be banned. You gave us no other option.</p>
<p>Kindly mind I was not well, so I took three days off, I'm sorry for my late reply.</p>
