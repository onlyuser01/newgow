    <h1>Gsn Casino Little Creek Resort Casino Casino Resorts In Washington Double Down Casino Facebook Casin</h1>

<p>Hello I logged in to my account today and I had over 1000€ in my account. then a few hours later I received an email that my account is suspended. I contacted them in live chat and I was told that is was a managerial decision that my account will be closed, after almost a year of working normally. I told them that I want them to withdraw my money back to my neteller account since I can not log in and was told that there is no money in my account that they have voided all of my bets. They can void my pending bets no problem, but they can not void my bets from a week ago that were settled a week ago, and steal the money I placed and the money I won. I received this email then :</p>
<p>Mr/Ms laura,</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that your account has come to our attention due to discrepancies identified during our regular security checks.</p>
<p>As a result of the investigation conducted into this matter, we have taken the following action on Karamba account;</p>

<p>We must further advise you that the business relationship between us has ended, please refrain from opening any new accounts with us this also means using amended details or alias. Any new accounts located will also have the above action taken</p>
<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>I got no explanations, no reasons and no evidence of what is happening, I did not use any bonuses with them, no free bets, I placed small bets from 10- 25€, I did not cheat or do anything wrong, they just closed my account and have stolen all of my money. with the same group that has over 50 casinos I also have an account with hopa and betiton that you also have under review and I received the same emails from them. I also have around 1000€ with hopa and 1200€ with betiton, but I also did not use any bonuses with any of them, I just used my own money. They say nowhere that you can not have more than one account with them as they are different sites, I did not use them, did not cheat, and now they are trying to steal 3300€ from me. I just want to receive back the money I have with them, that I deposited and won fairly, on markets they offered with limits they offered. They can close my account, but they can not steal all of my money like this. Please help me in this matter if you can and warn other players what is happening. thank you</p>
