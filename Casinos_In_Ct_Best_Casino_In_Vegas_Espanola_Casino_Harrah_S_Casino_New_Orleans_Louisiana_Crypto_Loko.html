<p>Betfred has been named the official sports betting partner of the Vegas Golden Knights amid the operator’s foray into Nevada</p>
<p>Sports betting giant Betfred has penned an agreement with yet another major sports team. This time, the operator signed a deal with the Vegas Golden Knights National Hockey League franchise, becoming its official sports betting partner.</p>
<p>Betfred and the Golden Knights Penned an Agreement</p>
<p>The agreement was announced by the Golden Knights yesterday. According to them, the multi-year partnership will see Betfred’s US branch support the club. The deal also coincides with the operator’s entry into the state of Nevada.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Betfred and the Golden Knights will launch interactive contests for fans during intermission at certain VGK home games. In addition, the team will work to popularize the operator’s brand and will promote its logo across the T-Mobile Arena stadium. Betfred’s branding will be visible on the dashboard, the LED signage, and the NHL’s all-new DED broadcast signage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the operator’s logo will be promoted across the Vegas Golden Knights’ various media channels. According to the team, the operator’s brand will be incorporated into its digital and social media channels, email newsletter and broadcasts.</p>
<p>This arrangement is a good opportunity for Betfred considering the Golden Knights’ popularity. They were the most successful expansion franchise in professional sports history in 2017-2018 and celebrated their fifth season in 2021-2022.</p>
<p>The Knights Welcomed Betfred into the Silver State</p>
<p>The president of the Vegas Golden Knights, Kerry Bubolz, commented on the agreement. He congratulated Betfred on its foray into Nevada, welcoming the operator into the state. Bobolz said that the NHL franchise is proud to have the global gambling powerhouse as its official sports betting partner.</p>
<p>Betfred’s US business is Vegas Born just like we are, and we’re excited to help them launch their brand in Nevada. Kerry Bubolz, president, Vegas Golden Knights</p>
<p>Bryan Bennett, Betfred Sportsbook’s chief operation officer, also shared his thoughts. He noted that the company’s US branch is based in Las Vegas, making the launch in Nevada very exciting.</p>
<p>The company is now preparing to open the first sportsbook in its hometown in collaboration with Mohegan Casino Las Vegas. As preparations continue, Betfred is delighted to join forces with the Golden Knights</p>
<p>We look forward to growing our business here and supporting Las Vegas hockey in the process. Bryan Bennett, COO, Betfred Sportsbook</p>
<p>Speaking about Betfred’s expansion into the state, the operator was recommended for a sports betting license a few days ago, facilitating its Nevada entry.</p>
<p>In other news, a month ago, Betfred also penned a multi-year partnership agreement with Loudoun United FC, an American soccer club based in Virginia.</p>
