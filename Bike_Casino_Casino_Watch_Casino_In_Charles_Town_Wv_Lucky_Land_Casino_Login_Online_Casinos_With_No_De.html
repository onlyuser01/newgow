<p>Everyone seems to like Paddy the Baddy, including the bookies. They see him as a strong favorite in the Pimblett vs Leavitt bout at UFC Fight Night 208, but is he really that good? The charismatic Scouser is 18-3 in his professional career with a 2-0 record since coming to the UFC. However, he still hasn’t fought against such a good fighter as Jordan Leavitt who is 10-1 overall.</p>

<p>Paddy Pimblett Dreaming of UFC Glory</p>
<p>Paddy “The Baddy” Pimblett is a former Cage Warriors champion who used to hold titles in two divisions. Even though he was on Dana White’s radar for years, he signed the UFC contract last year, making his debut on September 4, against Luigi Vendramini.</p>
<p>Pimblett came to the octagon as the betting favorite, quickly proving that the bookies were right to have faith in him. He knocked out his opponent in Round 1, earning the Performance of the Night bonus. He got the same bonus for his second UFC fight as well. It happened on March 19, when he beat Rodrigo Vargas by submission.</p>
<p>Pimblett’s antics both inside and outside the octagon made him a fan favorite. That’s what prompted Barstool Sports to give him over $1 million to become the brand ambassador. The UFC management, however, doesn’t seem to have too big plans for him. According to Paddy himself, he’s earned just $24,000 in his most recent UFC fight.</p>
<p>Obviously, he’ll have to prove to the UFC that he’s worth more than that. The best way to do that is to continue winning. If he wins again, it’s possible that he’s going to end up in the UFC lightweight rankings, which, in turn, would pave the way to a much bigger fight in the future.</p>
<p>Jordan Leavitt Determined Not to Let His Record Get Tarnished</p>
<p>The American fighter is 10-1 in his career with his only loss happening by points. He’s yet to get knocked out or lose by submission. Not losing within the distance is probably his main goal for the fight at UFC Fight Night 208.</p>
<p>Leavitt knows that he’s fighting a better opponent, which is why he needs to take a smart approach on Saturday. Although he’s probably equally good in grappling and wrestling as Pimblett, he just isn’t great striking-wise. At least not as great as Paddy, who will probably look to finish him with a knockout.</p>
<p>Paddy Pimblett vs Jordan Leavitt Prediction</p>
<p>Although Leavitt is far from being a bad fighter, we think Paddy the Baddy will destroy him on Saturday. UFC Fight Night 208 is taking place in London, which is where the Englishman will have the fans to cheer him on. And they will demand that he ends the fight in style.</p>
<p>Pick: Paddy Pimblett by knockout/technical knockout</p>
