    <h1>Casinos In Biloxi Mississippi Casino Peoria Il Casino Games Free Play Casino Tulsa Ok Santa Fe Hotel</h1>

<p>Hello. On 16th November 2023, Bongo casino informed me that I had to undergo a verification process on their website. For verification, I was required to provide: identification confirmation (a photo of my ID, a selfie with this ID in the backdrop of a chat with the customer service), proof of residence (a bank statement), and payment method confirmation (credit card statement or photo of the card). I promptly provided all these documents. Then, the real frustration began. The casino's verification department started to delay the verification process by constantly finding new reasons not to approve my account. After I provided the statement from the card I used to make a deposit, they asked for a six-month bank statement. Next, they demanded receipts for individual transactions from the previously given statement (which I also provided). Then, the casino asked me to explain why the debit from my card did not match the amount credited to their site. The staff seemed unqualified, and I had to explain that the debit from the card was in euros, although the account's currency and the site's currency are both in USD, and that the bank charges a fee for this operation. Later on, the casino requested a statement for a card that I never used to deposit on their site. Regardless, I provided it. They then asked for a receipt from this card for loading money onto my card. This is utterly absurd, as that card was loaded by a third party who has nothing to do with this website, nor does the card itself. As of now, the verification process has been going on for a month. The casino hasn't checked my documents for six days now, even though their regulations state that they shouldn't take more than five days to complete the verification. I contact them almost daily, but it's the same story every time. "Wait, we're checking, this is the procedure." I believe the casino is deliberately dragging the verification process to discourage me from fighting for my money. Please help me recover my funds.</p>
