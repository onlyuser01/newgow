<p>Ergin Ataman’s Boys Look Tough to Beat</p>
<p>As you can see from the Turkey vs France odds, the French are expected to have a field day on Saturday. However, we call for caution, based on what we’ve seen from the Turks so far at the EuroBasket 2022.</p>
<p>Led by EuroLeague-winning coach Ergin Ataman, Turkey finished the group phase with a 3-2 record in Group A. The teams they lost to are Georgia and Spain. In the game with Georgia – which was played in Georgia’s capital – Turkey lost only after overtime.</p>
<p>In the game against Spain, the reigning FIBA World Cup champions beat the Turks by just three points difference. Knowing all this, Turkey definitely seems capable of causing serious problems to France on Saturday.</p>
<p>This goes especially because the Turkey vs France game is played in Germany, which is the country with the largest Turkish community outside their home country.</p>
<p>The French Haven’t Been Too Impressive So Far</p>
<p>Before the start of the tournament, France was the #4 biggest EuroBasket 2022 favorite. No surprise there, as this team has several NBA stars on the roster, most notably, Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier.</p>
<p>What is surprising is that France finished the group phase in the #3 position. The explanation for that is that they played in arguably the toughest group, together with Slovenia, Germany, Lithuania, Bosnia, and Hungary.</p>
<p>Turkey vs France EuroBasket Prediction</p>
<p>France has better players than Turkey, there’s no doubt about that. However, the Turks have a fantastic coach and will have a lot of support from the stands. That should be enough to make this game way more entertaining than what bookies seem to suggest with their odds.</p>
<p>They see France as an 8.5-point favorite, but we just can’t see them cover the spread. Instead, we’re sure the Turks are going to give them a run for their money on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pick: Turkey (+8.5)</p>
