<p>Betfred Group has secured a partnership with Mohegan Sun Casino to run the sportsbook at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Las Vegas to Welcome Betfred Sportsbook with Mohegan Sun Casino</p>
<p>Betfred Group has entered in an exclusive sponsorship with a Nevada-based casino and hotel tribal operator, a first for the British company in the Silver State. The group has used its American subsidiary, Betfred USA Sports, to sign a landmark partnership with Mohegan Sun Casino at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, outside of the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>As a result, Betfred will be in charge of all sports betting operations within the casino. Presently, Betfred USA Sports already operates in several states, not least Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Colorado.</p>
<p>Expanding into the Silver States has long been on Betfred’s to-do list, after the company announced plans in 2019.</p>
<p>Betfred USA Chief Operating Officer Bryan Bennett has commented that the company has been negotiating with Mohegan Sun for the better part of a year, with the talks concluding in an official tie-up allowing Betfred to run the tribal operator’s sportsbook, part of the 60,000-square foot premium gaming venue.</p>
<p>Bennett didn’t spare commending Mohegan about both the company’s venue and high established track record:</p>
<p>“There is so much opportunity in Nevada. location like this property, just off the Strip, allows us to announce our presence to a great market. Variety is always good, and this won’t be our last location here.”</p>
<p>He was also convinced that, while Betfred’s footprint in the Virgin Hotels Las Vegas would be fairly small, the company would make the sportsbook stand out. Yet, Betfred is not drawing the line there.</p>
<p>More Innovation by Betfred</p>
<p>The company will work on introducing a mobile gaming platform for the casino. As to the physical sportsbook, it will be decked out with a state-of-the-art video wall, over-the-counter wagering, but also self-serving betting terminals.</p>
<p>Mohegan Gaming Vice President of Interactive Aviram Alroy met the news in the same good tone as had Betfred, arguing that the partnership would allow Mohegan to push the competition among sportsbooks in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Alroy didn’t miss to commend Betfred’s ability to develop a seamless and best-in-class product whether it had to do with sports betting or gaming. Mohegan is now looking forward to cater to both domestic and foreign consumers, the statement said.</p>
<p>Betfred already has several successful projects in the United States, including the Saratoga Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado, and the Wind Creek Casino Resort in Bethlehem in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Betfred’s also an official sportsbook sponsor for the Denver Broncos, one of the National Football League’s franchises.</p>
