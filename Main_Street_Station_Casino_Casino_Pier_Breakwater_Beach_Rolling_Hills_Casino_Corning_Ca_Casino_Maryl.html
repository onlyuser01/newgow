<p>The Green Bay Packers are 3-3 after suffering an embarrassing loss at Lambeau Field last week. They lost to the New York Jets 27-10, which was one of their most disappointing performances in years.</p>
<p>Matt LaFleur’s men need to bounce back to the winning track ASAP, but it won’t be easy because, in Week 7, they’re taking on the Washington Commanders at FedEx Field. The last time they played there, they lost 31-17.</p>

<p>A Must-Win Game for the Green Bay Packers</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the Green Bay Packers are having an awful season. One would think that a 3-3 record isn’t that bad, but even in the games they won, they weren’t playing great. Actually, the Packers only won one game by more than a field goal. It happened against the Chicago Bears, one of the worst teams in the conference.</p>
<p>The no.1 reason behind the Packers poor performances is that their offense has been pretty bleak in their first season without wide receiver Davante Adams. Without Adams to catch the balls, quarterback Aaron Rodgers has thrown for only seven touchdowns in the six games of 2022. Luckily for him, the Packers’ next opponent is a team that’s very bad when it comes to passing defense.</p>
<p>Washington Commanders Passing Defense is Horrible in 2022</p>
<p>The commanders are 2-4 in the 2022 season. Their offense has been very disappointing, with just 102 points scored after six-game weeks. This makes them the second-worst offense in the conference. Their offense will probably underperform once again, as they just don’t have a quarterback who could outsmart the Packers’ defense.</p>
<p>The thing is that Carson Wentz is out with a finger injury, which will probably keep him out of the game for four to six weeks. Taylor Heinicke will probably take his place on Sunday, but we don’t expect to see much from him.</p>
<p>Still, in Week 7, Washington’s biggest worry has to be their defense (passing defense, to be precise). Last season, they were the league’s fourth-worst team in terms of passing yards allowed, as well as the team with the most passing touchdowns conceded. In 2022, they’re only slightly better, but we think their stats are going to get much worse after Week 7.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers vs Washington Commanders Prediction</p>
<p>Anything but a big win for the Packers would be a huge surprise. They need to beat the Commanders and they need to do it in style in order to bring their mojo back ahead of the clash with the Buffalo Bills in Week 8.</p>
<p>Picks: Green Bay Packers to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
