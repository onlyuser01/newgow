<p>Loot boxes are under fire in the European country that seeks to implement changes and effectively regulate the lucrative mechanic that is a part of popular video games</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the popularity of loot boxes in video games has grown exponentially. While a majority of the audiences of video games remain children, the growing popularity of loot boxes raises concerns regarding their addictive mechanics that represent activity similar to online slots. Across Europe, loot boxes are under fire, with different countries considering measures to restrict the exposure of children to the mechanics that may cause addictive behavior, similar to problem gambling.</p>
<p>Germany is one European country where the debate for the protection of children, with restrictions related to loot boxes, continues. Regulation of the popular loot boxes has already reached the Bundestag with MPs from different parties supporting robust regulations that would restrict the mechanics, reveals the information platform, Gluecksspielwesen.de.</p>
<p>Linda Heitmann, a Bundestag member of the Green Party, recently spoke about the dangers of loot boxes, especially among children and young adults. She has already pushed forward a proposal for the regulation of loot boxes and acknowledged that the lucrative boxes with rewards may result in addictive behavior. Heitmann urged for the implementation of effective and robust regulation, saying that game developers need to run education campaigns and also offer “technical solutions such as automatic slowdowns when games last too long, by rewarding breaks and even banning loot boxes.”</p>
<p>“Loot boxes are an annoying and also dangerous phenomenon in video games and are particularly problematic when they appeal to children and young people. We have to realize that game developers are unfortunately amazingly creative when it comes to ripping off young people in video games and encouraging addictive tendencies. I see a need for tighter laws and regulations here,“ explains Linda Heitmann</p>
<p>Restrictions to Loot Boxes to Keep Gaming a Leisure Activity</p>
<p>According to Fabian Gramling, a CDU/CSU Member of the Bundestag, discussions about the protection of gamers from the lucrative loot boxes escalated recently. He reiterated Heitmann’s position that the lucrative game mechanics need to be regulated.</p>
<p>Gramling added that it is believed that some 330,000 young people may be suffering from pathological gambling behavior, a fact that reaffirms the need for strict regulations within the gaming sector. Still, he encouraged the upcoming changes to the sector to be backed by research into the effects of loot boxes.</p>
<p>“I attach great importance to ensuring that the gaming experience is positive and enjoyable without involving unpredictable financial risks.“ Lena Werner, member of the Bundestag from the SPD</p>
<p>Lena Werner, a member of the Bundestag from the SPD, spoke about the importance of the gaming sector in Germany. She outlined that a significant part of the sector’s sales involves in-game purchases such as loot boxes. Still, Werner said that she supports the idea of keeping the gaming sector free from financial risks and ensuring it is enjoyable for everyone. According to her, the gaming sector should be about leisure and not “gambling through the back door.”</p>
<p>Outside of Germany, other European countries are also exploring options for the regulation of loot boxes. For example, in Austria, lawmakers are considering legal changes, an option that Germany may also explore. On the other hand, Spain is considering implementing age restrictions for games that contain loot boxes.</p>
