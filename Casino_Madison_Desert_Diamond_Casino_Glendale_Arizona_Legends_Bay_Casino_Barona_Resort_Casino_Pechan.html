<p>The deal highlights the value SIS’ CS:GO product brings for operators and customers alike</p>
<p>Sports Information Services (SIS), a leading multi-content supplier of 24/7 live betting services, has agreed to provide the British operator Spreadex with high-integrity, event-based CS:GO content. As a result, the operator will secure access to many engaging esports events that will appeal to new-gen bettors.</p>
<p>Thanks to the current deal, Spreadex has secured access to two CS:GO 24/7 streams. In total, Spreadex players can expect a whopping 200,000 Competitive Gaming events a year.</p>
<p>SIS’s CS:GO esports suite features high-frequency 2v2 matches between professional players, providing sportsbooks and fans with many betting opportunities. The CS:GO product is a part of SIS’ Competitive Gaming portfolio and complements the supplier’s esoccer and ebasketball simulations, which are already live with Spreadex.</p>
<p>The CS:GO product comes with a rich selection of pre-match and in-play betting markets for fans of esports wagering. Thanks to ultra-low latency live streaming and on-screen graphics with betting prompts, consumers can closely follow the action without missing a beat or wagering opportunity.</p>
<p>SIS Competitive Gaming is notably the only esports betting product to ever earn the Esports Integrity Commission’s Gold Standards, attesting to the supplier’s commitment to integrity. Furthermore, SIS’ CS:GO offering fields referees with ESIC-based training, highlighting the supplier’s commitment to protecting its games from fraud. The skilled referees monitor each game and provide operators and traders with real-time communication.</p>
