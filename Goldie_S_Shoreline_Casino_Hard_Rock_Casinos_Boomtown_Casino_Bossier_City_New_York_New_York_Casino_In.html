<p>The globally recognized gaming company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced last week that it was recognized by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation's 2023-2024 Corporate Equality Index (CEI) with a top score of 100. Currently, CEI is the leading benchmark that recognizes the efforts and policies of companies for LGBTQ+ workplace equality.</p>
<p>For the 2023-2024 CEI, there were nearly 1,400 participating companies that showcased some of the best practices and effective policies that promote workplace quality for the United States as well as around the world. The HRC Foundation, the educational arm of the largest LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group in the US, helped assess participating companies and businesses based on specific requirements.</p>
<p>The participating companies have gone through an assessment of their corporate social responsibility and support toward an inclusive workplace culture. Moreover, the businesses' benefits for LGBTQ+ workers and their families were also rated. Finally, the rating involved the assessment of non-discrimination policies and practices.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, IGT first created the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion, which is now known as the Office of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion, to help implement policies, practices and systems that promote workplace diversity. The changes pushed by this program seek to ensure that IGT remains a leader in DEI, promotes workplace equality and is an attractive employer.</p>
<p>Among the changes pushed by the company's Office of DEI are the development of effective collaborative efforts with executive-sponsored Employee Impact Groups that play an important role in creating new policies and programs. Another focus of the company's office was elective and mandatory training for the company's employees on topics such as DEI, cultural awareness and unconscious bias, among other topics.</p>
<p>IGT's DEI efforts included the implementation of equitable and inclusive hiring processes. Further policies involved the option for the company's employees to personally select and share their preferred pronouns. "Respecting and creating space to recognize gender identity is a core element of DEI at IGT," explained the company.</p>
<p>In a statement released by IGT, RaShawn "Shawnie" Hawkins, the Human Rights Campaign Senior Director of Workplace Equality, commented: "For well over two decades, businesses have played an important role in furthering LGBTQ+ equality by centering employee needs and voices when it comes to workplace inclusion." Moreover, Hawkins pointed out: "While there is much more work to be done, year-over-year growth in CEI participation is evidence of a business community that recognizes the responsibility and value in upholding equity and inclusion."</p>
<p>Brian Blake, IGT's Vice President, Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion, was similarly thrilled. "IGT being recognized once again with a top score in HRC's 2023-2024 Corporate Equality Index demonstrates our commitment to delivering an inclusive workplace culture where LGBTQ+ employees are welcomed and valued," he added. Finally, Blake spoke about the company's ongoing efforts towards DEI that helped IGT become a more inclusive employer for LGBTQ+ experts.</p>
