    <h1>Redstag Casino Hotels Near Parx Casino Turtle Creek Casino Michigan River Spirit Casino Resort River</h1>

<p>Dear Vickie,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://24mcasino.com/templates/company/responsible_gaming:</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>Self- Exclusion is a more extensive way to control your activity at 24monaco.com.</p>
<p>Self-exclusion means that you decide to close your account for a period up to 3 months. In case you wish to Self- Exclude your account, please contact our Customer Support Team who will be happy to assist you."</p>
<p>https://24mcasino.com/templates/company/terms_and_conditions:</p>
<p>"Self exclude or Timeout - We will only reply to emails sent to support@24mcasino.com for this action and clearly mark in the subject line 'Account Closure. Any emails not stating your reason for closing eg; gambling problem will not be actioned as an urgent request. We take these requests seriously but due to the high levels of emails it may take us some time to reply. Any deposits made before the account is closed will be accepted and are non refundable."</p>
<p>Is the email address mentioned above, that one, you have sent your emails to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
