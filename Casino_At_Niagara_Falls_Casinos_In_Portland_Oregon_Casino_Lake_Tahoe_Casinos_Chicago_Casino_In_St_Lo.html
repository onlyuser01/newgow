    <h1>Casino At Niagara Falls Casinos In Portland Oregon Casino Lake Tahoe Casinos Chicago Casino In St Lo</h1>

<p>requested a withdrawal over 2 weeks ago, i have heard nothing from the casino. I have sent several emails(they dont have live chat) but still no response. The only emails i've received from them were on feb 1 and that was just telling me that my verification had been approved, and then another email on the 13th telling me again that my verification had been approved. No mention of my withdrawal request. Its weird because I requested a withdrawal at the end of January(first time) and that one was for $2500 and that went through without any issues. And my VIP status is "Elite" the highest level they have .</p>
<p>On the attached screenshot of my account history, it says the withdrawal was requested on the 15th, but i requested long before that. They have the wrong dates on some of the transactions.</p>
