    <h1>Foxwood Resort Casino Free Chips For Doubledown Casino Casino In Tucson Buffalo Casino Empire City C</h1>

<p>BetMGM, one of the leading online casino and sports betting operators in the United States, has changed its recent marketing push to feature a slightly heavier focus on its gaming operations. A new 30-second spot featuring actress and singer Vanessa Hudgens and created by 72andSunny, a creative agency, takes players on a brief journey through the casino’s library of games.</p>
<p>Hudgens finds herself in a library setting which materializes after Hudgens uses the BetMGM app on her phone. Then, the audiences and Hudgens are taken on a rollercoaster trip through different casino games featured in the brand’s library, with the spot boldly emblazoning on the screen the catchphrase: "The King of Casino," a challenge to other gaming operators and a signal to online casino players that BetMGM is all about delivering the best possible experience.</p>
<p>BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost was among the executives to comment on Hudgens’ participation in the spot. He said that the actress’ part had truly brought the commercial to life. "This is an incredible collaboration that will keep audiences old and new engaged," Prevost added.</p>
<p>The spot, which was led by 72andSunny and filmmaker Calmatic, has already caught the attention of social media with the campaign achieving a strong reach over its first 24 hours. Calmatic is a director known for his work with superstars such as Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus.</p>
<p>This campaign follows another recent and equally innovative series featuring Jamie Foxx, as BetMGM continues to exercise strong brand building and is determined to establish itself as a leader in the iGaming and sports betting space in the United States.</p>
<p>BetMGM, though, has been actively expanding beyond its own stomping ground in North America, and moved in on the United Kingdom earlier this year. The company has been designing new ways for its players to interact with the company’s products, including the Borgata Arcade in New Jersey, featuring LuckyTap, Slingo, and scratch card games, among others.</p>
<p>72andSunny Creative Director Geno Burmester hailed the collaboration with Calmatic, the real name of Charles Kidd II, and hailed the resulting product as precisely what BetMGM would need to ensure that its name is known among casino players. BetMGM currently has access to 26 markets through mobile and retail operations.</p>
