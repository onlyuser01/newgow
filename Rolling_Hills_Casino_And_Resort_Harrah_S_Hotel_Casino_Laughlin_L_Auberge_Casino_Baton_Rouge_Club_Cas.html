<p>The supplier will strengthen the popular Belgium casino’s library of games offering fresh products and experiences to local players</p>
<p>Synot Games is happy to provide its range of games to PepperMill Casino and supply it with a selection of powerful and worthwhile games that will bolster engagement and drive retention rates for the popular brand.</p>
<p>Synot is moving forward with a hand-picked portfolio of games that will be introduced to PepperMill Casino’s land-based properties in Belgium. A digital extension of this partnership has also been signed up, allowing the companies to further bolster their mutual presence in the market and provide players with a 360-degree experience.</p>
<p>Synot Keen to Expand in Belgium</p>
<p>Some of the games that will be introduced to PepperMill Casino and are now going to be available to players include popular picks from Synot’s portfolio such as Book of Secrets 6 Dice, Respin Joker Dice, Firebird Double 27 Dice, and many others.</p>
<p>Synot Games CCO Martina Hrabinská was excited to see this partnership come through and said:</p>
<p>The deal with PepperMill Casino is in line with our strategy to expand across regulated markets and let millions of gamers play and enjoy our world-class portfolio. Synot Games CCO Martina Hrabinská</p>
<p>She further noted that PepperMill Casino had significant ambitions for the Belgium market – and other jurisdictions – which is precisely why Synot is excited to be working with the company on this content collaboration.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Synot Games offers more than 100 games in 32 languages, making its potential global reach outstanding, and paving the way for future content collaborations with PepperMill Casino, including expansions.</p>
<p>PepperMill Casino Welcomes New Supplier</p>
<p>PepperMill Casino casino manager Jorn Stifter was similarly pleased with the opportunity to be teaming up with a respected supplier such as Synot. Stifter added:</p>
<p>We’re incredibly pleased to have partnered with Synot Games as we continue our mission to delight players and reinvent casino entertainment for a new age of gaming. PepperMill Casino casino manager Jorn Stifter</p>
<p>He further praised Synot’s reputation in the industry, saying that PepperMill Casino’s opinion of the supplier was one of a producer of high-quality games that bring outstanding slot options. Synot Games has been recently on a tear as well, with the company signing several prominent partnerships.</p>
<p>The supplier established a content alliance with betFIRST and it has further taken another step in the German gaming market through a partnership with StarGames.de. Synot has also struck a similar partnership with CBet in Lithuania.</p>
