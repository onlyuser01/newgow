    <h1>American Casino Guide New Hampshire Casino Lopesan Costa Bavaro Resort Spa Casino Highfive Casino Ba</h1>

<p>Hotel and casino entertainment company Caesars Entertainment has been selected as the National Football League team Indianapolis Colts’ premier betting partner. By inking the deal, Caesars became the franchise’s sole official casino partner.</p>
<p>Caesars Becomes Indianapolis’ Premier Betting Partner</p>
<p>Following the deal, Caesars Entertainment will receive several benefits that will boost the company’s popularity. First of all, the Lucas Oil Stadium’s South Gate will be renamed Caesars South Gate. The stadium itself will see a Caesars Sportsbook Lounge open at the place of the former Blue Room.</p>
<p>Caesars’ new retail sportsbook will be equipped with numerous screens that will broadcast the games and show the current betting odds. Access to the Caesars Sportsbook Lounge will be granted only to adult fans above 21, as per the regulations.</p>
<p>Additionally, Caesars will sponsor a free-to-play game of the Indianapolis Colts. Called “Pick 6”, this predictor game will give players a random selection of six questions about how an upcoming game will unfold. Based on how many correct answers they’ve given, participants will be given various weekly prizes. Some lucky ones will get the grand prize of a Las Vegas trip that includes a stay at a luxurious Caesars Entertainment hotel.</p>
<p>As the NFL progresses, Caesars will also get much more exposure through the Indianapolis Colts’ marketing campaign. For the franchise’s fans, that means exclusive offers and promotions that will take their experience a notch further.</p>
<p>Taking Indiana Fans’ Experience to a New Level</p>
<p>Caesars Digital’s co-president, Chris Holdren, believes that Caesars becoming the Indianapolis Colts’ premier sports betting partner is an “exciting step” in the two parties’ longstanding relationship. Holdren explained that Indiana is a special place for the gambling operator and that everyone at Caesars knows the local fans’ dedication to sports and to their home team.</p>
<p>Because of that, Holdren promised that “Caesars will continue to push for innovation to bring the best in sports experiences”. He added that this applies to both the mobile Caesars sportsbook and to the land-based sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The Caesars Sportsbook application reflects the company’s vision of bringing an engaging and user-friendly experience to the hands of the fans. Caesars players get extra benefits as even losing bets score special credits that can be collected and used for various rewards in the Caesars Rewards loyalty program.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis Colts are also happy to have a reputable gambling and hospitality company as their partner. Roger VanDerSnick, the franchise’s chief sales, and marketing officer, also shared his thoughts:</p>
<p>“We’ve been a proud partner with Caesars properties in Indiana for some time now, but this new partnership expands our ability to offer Colts fans a truly unique experience, whether at Lucas Oil Stadium or watching from home on game day,” he said.</p>
<p>With this partnership in place and the two parties’ vow to work together for their mutual future, fans of the Colts can expect to see a lot of Caesars during the NFL season.</p>
