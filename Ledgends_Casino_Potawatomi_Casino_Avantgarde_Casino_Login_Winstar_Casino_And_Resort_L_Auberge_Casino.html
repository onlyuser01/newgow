    <h1>Ledgends Casino Potawatomi Casino Avantgarde Casino Login Winstar Casino And Resort L Auberge Casino</h1>

<p>June has already been an extremely busy month for Swintt, the "Innovation in Mobile" winner at the EGR B2B Awards in 2022</p>
<p>Throughout the month, the popular game provider with a focus on localized, versatile content, and gamification tools launched the Chinese-themed slot Lucky Fortune Door, announced a content distribution partnership with 711 Casino for the Dutch market, and released the Big Max Pot and Pearls slot with mystery prizes and a Pearl Respins jackpot bonus feature.</p>
<p>Now, the studio that aims to become the fastest-growing content supplier in the industry has announced a fresh slot release. The action-packed Electric Elements game cleverly conjures all the powers of water, wind, fire, and earth in what the provider promises to be an electrifying experience thanks to the embedded elemental boosters and no less than five free spin modes.</p>
<p>Electric Elements Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Rows: 7</p>
<p>Paylines: Cluster Pays</p>
<p>RTP: 95.96%</p>
<p>Hit Freq: 45.93%</p>
<p>Max Win: x656</p>
<p>Volatility: Low-Medium</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0.20/100</p>
<p>Release date: June 21, 2023</p>
<p>A Cluster Pays Game Packed with Features</p>
<p>The slot is played on a 5×7 grid and it can be smoothly enjoyed on all compatible mobile devices in portrait mode.</p>
<p>The space guardian theme is nicely complemented by the one-of-a-kind selection of game symbols chosen by the talented Swintt team. The list ranges from the specific elements of wind, water, fire, and earth, and it also includes the celestial beings that represent them.</p>
<p>Since it is a cluster pays slot, players will notice the missing paylines. Instead, gamers need to focus on landing clusters of adjacent symbols. When this occurs, the respective symbols are seen exploding and disappearing from the grid, making room for fresh symbols to drop down to their position.</p>
<p>The cluster pays mechanic can be easily triggered with the help of the substitute wilds as well as the four available elemental boosters which players can use during each new spin. Elemental boosters are engaged by landing symbol combinations that feature a minimum of 25 identical icons that can fill up the element meter during just one spin.</p>
<p>Since the cluster pays mechanic is a continuous one, the identical symbols do not need to be a part of a single win. Instead, they can be spread across several wins so the meter can be filled more easily.</p>
<p>Every elemental booster is responsible for applying a certain bonus effect to the grid. Players can also simultaneously engage multiple boosters once all four element meters are filled up.</p>
<p>Free Spins Feature and Bonus Buy</p>
<p>When all element meters are filled up during a single spin, the Free Spins feature is triggered. Here, players need to make their pick from five available Free Spins modes, ranging from the wind element that can bring them 16 Free Spins and 3 Free Spins when all elements in play are offered.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new game that also features a Bonus Buy option, Swintt’s chief executive officer, David Mann, called it “one of the most exciting and ambitious releases” that their team has created so far.</p>
<p>Mann also expressed their delight about being able to give the game its highly-anticipated debut at partner casinos. At the end of May, the provider inked a fresh connect agreement with Lithuanian operator 7Bet.</p>
