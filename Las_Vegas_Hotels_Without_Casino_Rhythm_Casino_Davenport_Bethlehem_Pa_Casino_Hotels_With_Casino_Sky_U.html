<p>SoftSwiss, the leading iGaming industry company, announced it expanded the functionality of its leading Casino Platform. Last week, the company unveiled the launch of a new feature complementing its platform called Team Tournaments.</p>
<p>The innovative feature boosts player versus player competitiveness while at the same time increasing fan engagement opportunities. Team Tournaments builds upon SoftSwiss' Tournaments solution and enhances the competitiveness of the players.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the new solution increases the chances of players winning. This is because, with Team Tournaments, contributions of several players for one event are distributed among its members. In other words, even if one player loses, there is still a chance for their team to win the tournament depending on the performance of the team.</p>
<p>By design, Team Tournaments creates up to 10 teams in the casino. The number of players is defined by criteria that seeks to have an even number of players in each of the different teams. A pre-defined operator setting is responsible for the even distribution of all players among the different teams.</p>
<p>Anna Loiko, SoftSwiss Casino Platform's Product Owner, shared her excitement in a statement released on September 30, 2022. She said: "We are proud to announce the launch of Team Tournaments for our clients." Citing research, Loiko acknowledged that in the same way the Tournaments solution was well received, the company expects to see a good acceptance rate for its new Team Tournament solution.</p>
<p>"The new functionality engages a competitive element and generates team hype, which is the foundation for a high level of player engagement," she explained. In conclusion, Loiko said that SoftSwiss will continue to work on the new feature and update it and vowed that soon, new novelties will make it even more attractive.</p>
<p>Predicting the success of its new feature, SoftSwiss released details from internal research by its Casino Platform team. According to that data, the new Team Tournament solution is expected to increase customer loyalty and player engagement.</p>
<p>Moreover, the internal research points out that there is an increase in the activity and the willingness to deposit by users that win tournament rewards. According to SoftSwiss' research, the sums deposited by such users increased nearly double, while the depositing interval increases approximately 10% to 20%. Without any doubt, this confirms that the solution helps with the casino's growth.</p>
<p>Only recently, SoftSwiss expanded the reach of its Jackpot Aggregator tool. This was completed via a partnership between SoftSwiss and the iGaming operator Abocasino.</p>
<p>Before that, in August, SoftSwiss Managed Services revealed that its Anti-Fraud Team completed a training course by GamCare. Thanks to that collaboration, the company's team enhanced its knowledge and experience within the social responsibility field.</p>
