    <h1>Cosmopolitan Casino Las Vegas San Manuel Casino Jobs Lucky Dragon Casino Casinos In Albuquerque Best</h1>

<p>Dear matide,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>Every casino has different standards of documents they accept. Did the casino give you any instructions on the format the casino accepts the document? Please note, while the document is legible to me, the issues might include that the document is also partially covered with a magnet, part of it is obscured due to the bad angle of the light, and only one page of 2 is shown.</p>
<p>I found on the casino website a little guide (in English) that might be of help:</p>

<p>Please understand that we don’t have the insight necessary to deal with sports betting issues and I can’t be of more help with your issue of why your sports betting section was made inaccessible. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve the verification issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
