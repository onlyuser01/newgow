    <h1>Lucky Lil S Casino Reddog Casino Local Casinos Kats Casino Login Nh Casino Minnesota Vikings vs New</h1>

<p>Minnesota Vikings vs New Orleans Saints is the first NFL International Series game of the 2022 season. The game is taking place at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London on Sunday morning ET.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t think this game is going to make the London crowd fall in love with football. Instead, this could be a fairly unentertaining game with only a couple of touchdowns. This, however, doesn’t mean the Vikings vs Saints Week 4 is going to be a snooze fest for bettors. Knowing that these two are pretty similar when compared player for player, meaning that anything can happen on Sunday.</p>

<p>Why are Minnesota Vikings Favored by Bookies?</p>
<p>The main reason why bookmakers think of the Vikings as the favorites in the Week 4 London game is that this team’s record is 2-1, while the record of the Saints is 1-2. The Vikings have a better record, but we aren’t too impressed by their performances in 2022.</p>
<p>In Week 1, they defeated the Green Bay Packers in Minneapolis. The final score was 23-7, but it had more to do with the poor performance of the Packers. In Week 2, the Vikings lost to the Philadelphia Eagles on the road. The score was 24-7 for Philly.</p>
<p>They got to their second win of the season last weekend when they defeated the Detroit Lions 28-24. Knowing that the Lions’ defense is one of the worst in the league, we can’t say we were surprised to see the Vikings score 28 points.</p>
<p>The game in question was played in Minnesota and the hosts scored four touchdowns – two passing TDs and two rushing TDs. One of those two rushing touchdowns was the work of Dalvin Cook, who unfortunately suffered a shoulder injury that day, for which he will miss the London game.</p>
<p>New Orleans Saints Offense Looking Horrible</p>
<p>The Saints’ defense has been doing a pretty good job so far in the 2022 NFL season. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about their offense. Led by Jameis Winston, New Orleans recorded just 24 points in total in the last two games.</p>
<p>Winston just doesn’t seem like a quarterback who can lead the Saints to glory this season. In three NFL games of 2022, he threw for a total of 858 yards and four touchdowns, while getting five of his passes intercepted.</p>
<p>We doubt he’s going to improve his stats in Week 4, meaning that we’ll probably see the Saints record no more than just a touchdown or two.</p>
