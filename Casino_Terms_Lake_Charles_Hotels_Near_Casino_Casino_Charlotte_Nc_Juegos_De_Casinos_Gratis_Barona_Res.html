<p>Independent provider of mobile gaming products ESA Gaming announced it has entered the Greek gaming market, taking its content live via an agreement with Betshop.</p>
<p>Foray into Greece</p>
<p>The agreement with the betting and gaming operator empowered ESA Gaming to present its full portfolio of EasySwipe games to Greek players, offering them the thrill of its popular titles Goal Mine, Joker Poker and Basketball Mine.</p>
<p>Commenting on the company’s Greek debut, Maria Luisa Malfasi, business development manager at ESA Gaming, expressed her excitement to see the company’s games live in Greece, marking the entry as an important milestone for the business.</p>
<p>“We are extremely bullish about the potential for our non-traditional gaming products in the Greek market, and look forward to our first foray into the region,” Malfasi concluded.</p>
<p>Developed as an innovative product, ESA Gaming’s EasySwipe enhances cross-selling opportunities for operators active in both the sports betting and iGaming verticals without cannibalizing sportsbook and online casino revenue channels by simply offering swipe-in titles to sports bettors.</p>
<p>“ESA Gaming’s unique EasySwipe titles are perfectly designed for cross-sell, sitting at the junction of sportsbook and casino, so it made perfect sense for us to partner with them,” said Effie Tsekoura, casino manager at Betshop, outlining that the company is looking forward to assessing how the innovative and exciting nature of these titles will be received by its players.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming received its supplier license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission in December last year, allowing the company to distribute mobile gaming products headlined by the EasySwipe range to players in Greece.</p>
<p>European Presence and Expansion</p>
<p>The entry in Greece is the latest in a series of efforts of the boutique independent provider of high-performing, mobile online gaming products focused on innovation that is seeking to expand its presence into European gaming jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2021, ESA Gaming signed distribution deals with casino operator Giocaonline and game distributor BLOX to see its EasySwipe titles made available to players in Italy, while in Portugal, ESA Gaming launched its EasySwipe games with local operator Casino Portugal. ESA Gaming also holds supplier licenses and certifications for its products in Sweden, Romania, and Denmark.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming’s poker products, including Texas Hold’em, Omaha and tournaments went live in Colombia after the company signed an agreement with the first operator authorized to offer legal online poker in the country, BetPlay.</p>
<p>In Latin America, ESA Gaming partnered with Emara Play to add its EasySwipe titles to the aggregator’s platform. The deal also provides for a future launch in Spain.</p>
