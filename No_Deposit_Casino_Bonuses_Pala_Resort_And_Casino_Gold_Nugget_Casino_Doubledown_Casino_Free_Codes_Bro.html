<p>The state of Indiana is just days away from being the 12 th state offering regulated sports betting</p>
<p>state offering regulated sports betting At least three casinos will start accepting sports wagers come September 1 st and a few more to open in the following days</p>
<p>and a few more to open in the following days Current tax expectancies aim at just $13 million in revenue per year to go to the state</p>
<p>Just days prior to the full-blown legalization of sports betting in the state of Indiana, casinos are preparing to welcome gamblers.</p>
<p>Indiana’s Sports Betting Launch</p>
<p>Just a few weeks earlier in mid-August, Iowa became the first among Midwestern states to legalize sports betting. Illinois also legalized sports betting in June but has just started discussions on how to go about creating a legislation. Indiana, though, has the geographical advantage of being located in proximity to more than a few big cities, which could act to attract a larger crowd.</p>
<p>Given Indiana’s long withstanding drop in gambling revenue – approximately 18% since 2012 – this move might provide the necessary stimuli for the betting industry to get back on its feet in the state. The legislative report issued by the state’s lawmakers also shows a no-pressure treatment of the matter, as the state is imposing a tax of just 9.5% of gambling establishment’s sports book winnings, expecting approximately $13 million per year.</p>
<p>In Line for the Big Launch</p>
<p>This has not gone unnoticed, as word is that quite a few sports books are ready and set to open come the 1st of September. These would include Caesars Entertainment – Indiana’s largest casino operator – who are reportedly intending to celebrate the opening at their Shelbyville Indiana Grand casino, followed by new sportsbook openings at their downtown Indianapolis OTB on September 3rd and at Horseshoe Hammond just the following day.</p>

<p>Penn National also aim for grand openings on the launching date at their Ameristar East Chicago and Hollywood casino in Lawrenceburg. Bearing in mind their rivalry with Caesars Entertainment, offerings should benefit from the competitive spirit.</p>
<p>The Indiana Gaming Commission’s executive director, Sara Gonso Tait, said that mobile betting will not be prohibited and will follow the launch as soon as operators are set to launch their respective apps and/or services.</p>
<p>Quite a few more casino and off-track betting site operators are also expected to launch services later in September. It’s about to be an exciting summer-end for Hoosiers, as most of the early-day openings will be accompanied by ceremonies. The Hollywood casino in Lawrenceburg has invited Cincinnati sports stars Anthony Munoz and Tony Perez, while Boyd Gaming’s Blue Chip Casino will celebrate with special guest star Brian Urlacher from the Chicago Bears on September 5.</p>
<p>Indiana State Rules for Sports Betting</p>
<p>As established among other states, at first gamblers will be required to register an account at a land-based casino in order to be able to use mobile services, such as apps or placing wagers through websites. This will entail proper ID in order to prove they’re older than 21.</p>
<p>Sports wagers will be available for many professional, collegiate or international sports events, which include football, baseball, car racing, hockey, soccer, golf and Olympic competitions, among others. The only sports activities banned from placing bets on are youth sports events and e-sports.</p>
