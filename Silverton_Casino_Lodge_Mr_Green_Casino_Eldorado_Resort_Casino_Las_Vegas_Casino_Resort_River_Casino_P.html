<p>The instant payment solution allows Nuvei partners to offer players instant deposits from and payout to a bank account</p>
<p>Payments technology provider Nuvei Corporation announced today it has partnered with Resorts Digital Gaming (RDG) to power online casino platforms across all of its brands with instant bank transfers.</p>
<p>Enhancing User Experience</p>
<p>The new agreement with RDG will see the fintech company offer the Nuvei Instant Bank Transfer solution to online casino players of all iGaming brands of the casino company. Operating out of New Jersey, RDG is the digital arm of Resorts Casino Hotel.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, the chief executive officer of RDG, Ed Andrewes, outlined the operator’s dedication “to offering the best user experience in New Jersey,” hailing Nuvei Instant Bank Transfer as “one of the most popular and convenient deposit and payout payment methods in the US iGaming market.”</p>
<p>“Integrating Nuvei into our cashier supports our mission to provide all the relevant payment methods our players demand,” Andrewes said, eager to start “working closely with Nuvei and its team and even expand the partnership beyond that into opportunities to accelerate growth.”</p>
<p>The instant bank transfer solution allows players to deposit instantly into their gaming accounts from their bank accounts, while the process is further simplified by the exclusive integration of Nuvei with Plaid, allowing funds to be uploaded to a gaming account with a single click.</p>
<p>Seamless Payment Options</p>
<p>Philip Fayer, chief executive officer and chair at Nuvei, also commented on the new partnership, stressing the importance of “seamless and relevant payment options” for iGaming operators in the US and the role payment options play for operators in terms of player acquisition and revenue growth.</p>
<p>“Nuvei Instant Bank Transfer was the first payment method to bring truly instant payouts to the US iGaming market,” Fayer said, pointing out that “this enhanced user experience has eliminated the need for players to wait hours or even days” to have money from their gaming account withdrawn.</p>
<p>An integration of Nuvei with The Clearing House’s Real Time Payments (RTP) Network allowed Nuvei to become the first payment provider to offer its partners instant withdrawal options for players with bank accounts in banks that are connected to the RTP network.</p>
<p>“RDG is a pillar of the iGaming industry in New Jersey, so we are looking forward to working together to maximize the benefits that our market-leading platform and deep knowledge of the industry will bring to their player experience, and ultimately revenues,” Fayer concluded.</p>
<p>RDG is the latest online casino provider to team up with the Canadian fintech in which Hollywood actor, producer and entrepreneur, Ryan Reynolds, recently invested. Other partners from the iGaming sector include Holland Casino which recently took advantage of Nuvei’s instant payout solutions.</p>
<p>As the digital arm of Resorts Casino Hotel, RDG embraces the values of its parent that has made a name for itself by offering world-class casino and sports betting in a relaxed environment in Atlantic City, boasting hundreds of online slots and table games, live dealer games and virtual sports on the platforms it operates, including ResortsCasino.com and MoheganSunCasino.com.</p>
