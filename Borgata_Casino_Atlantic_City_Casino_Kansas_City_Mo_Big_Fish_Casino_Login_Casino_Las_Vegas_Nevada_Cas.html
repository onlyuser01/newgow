<p>The second golf major on the 2023 calendar is on the program this week. What weâ€™re talking about is the 2023 PGA Championship, which will take place at Oak Hill Country Club in New York, from Thursday to Sunday</p>
<p>Oddsmakers suspect thereâ€™s going to be a two-horse race between Jon Rahm and Scottie Scheffler at the 2023 PGA Championship. Still, we wouldnâ€™t be surprised if an upset happened this weekend. After all, a number of golfing legends are coming to Oak Hill, including Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka, and Justin Thomas, all of whom have won this tournament in the past.</p>
<p>Anything can happen in this tournament, but one thing is certain â€“ the 2023 PGA Championship is going to be an event to remember.</p>

<p>Jon Rahm and Scottie Scheffler Sharing the No. 1 Favoriteâ€™s Role</p>
<p>Jon Rahm and Scottie Scheffler are the players that occupy the two top spots in the Official World Golf Ranking. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s no surprise that theyâ€™re seen as the top favorites to win the PGA Championship 2023.</p>
<p>Rahm has been in fantastic shape this year, winning four of the 12 events heâ€™s taken part in so far. The most notable of those is The Masters, which he won in early April.</p>
<p>ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯</p>
<p>World #1 Jon Rahm is looking to go for back to back majors after winning the Masters. This year, he is currently 1st for all par 3,4, and 5 scoring.</p>

<p>If Rahm wins the 2023 PGA Championship, heâ€™s going to become only the fifth golfer in history to win these two golf majors in a single calendar year. The last time someone achieved this feat was in 1975 when Jack Nicklaus pulled it off.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think thereâ€™s a very good chance that Rahm is going to do it. Heâ€™s sharing the No. 1 spot on the 2023 PGA Championship favorites list with Scottie Scheffler. He too has already done wonders this year. For example, in March, we saw him win The Players Championship.</p>
<p>Former Champs Hoping for Resurgence</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka, and Justin Thomas each have two PGA Championship titles in their collection. One may argue that each of them is past their prime, but these guys have been doing okay since the start of the year.</p>
<p>This goes especially for Rory McIlroy, whoâ€™s gotten all the way to the No. 3 place in the Official World Golf Ranking. With a little bit of luck, he could get back to the golfing throne sooner than most people are expecting.</p>
<p>Although itâ€™s been a while since we saw him win any big event, no one can dispute that the 34-year-old has the skillset necessary to win the tournament at Oak Hill.</p>
<p>2023 PGA Championship Prediction</p>
<p>Jon Rahm is our favorite pick for the 2023 PGA Championship. Everything seems to be going in his favor â€“ great form, motivation, etc. â€“ apart from the fact that the competition is as tough as it can be.</p>
<p>The good news for Rahm is that everything is in his hands. Heâ€™s better than everyone else coming to Oak Hill, so unless he messes things up, heâ€™s going to win his second golf major of 2023.</p>
<p>Pick: Jon Rahm to win</p>
