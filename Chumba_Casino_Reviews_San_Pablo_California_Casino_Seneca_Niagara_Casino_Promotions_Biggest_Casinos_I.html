    <h1>Chumba Casino Reviews San Pablo California Casino Seneca Niagara Casino Promotions Biggest Casinos I</h1>

<p>I've played before at this casino and after some withdraws I think they limited the rTp for my account as most of the game were not even giving back 80% of the money I have played with. Because of that, I stopped playing there for a several months. However, two weeks ago I decided to try again and deposited 40 BGN with a Virtual Debit Card from Phyre app (like Revolut). I won 400 on pragmatic games and decided to make a withdraw and there started the problems. They wanted to verify the new card by sending them a picture of its face. But because it is virtual, the only option Is to take a screenshot of it, however the app does't allow taking screenshots in the page that shows the cards, so then I told them it is not possible. They Said to contact phyre. Phyre issued me a document that shows the transaction to Efbet, part of the card number, my names, their company (Paynetics) , their employee signature and a company stamp. I sent that document to efbet and after 4 days I got the same message as the first one - to send them a picture of the card face. I explained them again it is not possible and they told me that this document doesn't show my names which is not true! Then I decided to take a picture of my phones screen with another device while the virtual card is opened in the app. I sent them this and then after two more days, I got a new message from them asking me to take a screenshot of the transaction. I did this as well, sent it to them, waited 2 days and got a new message - ASKING FOR A PICTURE OF MY CARDS FACE. Isn't this not serious? I know they pay you to list them on this website and to give them such a big rating but please, this way you scam more people. Everyone in bulgaria knows about their scam practices. The games are even hacked and they can manipulate the RTP. Just look into their website and you'll see that the games are hosted on their own servers.</p>
<p>Because of this situations, they got on my nerves and I told them I want to delete my account and they said that this is not possible and they wont do it. Which serious casino desn't allow its players to delete their accounts if they want?!?!</p>
<p>I can provide you with screenshots of their emails and all the information you need.</p>
<p>Would be happy if you do something about these scammers.</p>
