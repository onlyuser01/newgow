<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) announced yesterday numerous regulatory fines totaling $238,500. The fines were levied against four casinos and two licensed vendors that do direct business with the licensed gaming establishments.</p>
<p>The two vendors — Gaming Partners International USA, Inc. and GPI Mexicana S.A. de C.V. — were hit the hardest. The table game manufacturers were issued $85,500 fines each for failing to submit audited annual financial statements to the PGCB no later than 90 days after the conclusions of their 2019 and 2020 fiscal years.</p>
<p>The remaining $145,000 in fines were issued against Hollywood Casino at the Meadows, Mohegan Sun Pocono, Rivers Casino Philadelphia, and Rivers Casino Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Casino Infractions</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino at the Meadows in Washington, which was known as The Meadows until last fall, was fined $40,000 for overserving alcohol to a patron.</p>
<p>The PGCB says the guest was served 17 draft beers during an 11-hour period. Another individual was served five mixed drinks, three shots, and a draft beer in a three-and-a-half-hour time frame.</p>
<p>The first intoxicated person ended up injuring himself in a fall. The second person became involved in a physical altercation that resulted in an alleged assault of two patrons and two casino security guards.</p>
<p>The state fined Mohegan Sun Pocono $10,000 for allowing a person access to its gaming floor after previously self-excluding from all land-based casinos in Pennsylvania. Rivers Casino Philadelphia was also hit with a $10,000 penalty for permitting underage individuals access to their casino. The under-21 person later gambled at the casino.</p>
<p>The state gaming agency additionally fined Rivers Casino Pittsburgh $7,500 for failing to adhere to a PGCB order to replace software on a dozen slot machines. The state said the replacement software not being installed did not result in any additional regulatory violations.</p>
<p>Record Revenue</p>
<p>During the state gaming hearing this week, where the six fines were handed down, PGCB Executive Director Kevin O’Toole teased that preliminary data for March revenue suggests another record-setting report.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s all-time best gross gaming revenue (GGR) month was set in November 2021. Gaming income from brick-and-mortar casinos, iGaming, retail and online sports betting, video gaming terminals (VGTs), and daily fantasy sports totaled $423.7 million that month.</p>
<p>However, O’Toole suggested that the state gaming industry’s revenue ceiling has once again been broken. The executive director said yesterday that March GGR will likely come in north of $463 million.</p>
<p>If that is realized once the numbers are finalized and confirmed, March 2022 will represent a more than 9% premium on the state’s previous all-time best mark. The official March gaming revenue report is set for release next week.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of the nation’s largest and richest gaming industries. Today, the commonwealth is home to 16 brick-and-mortar casinos, plus interactive internet slots and table games, online and in-person sportsbooks, truck stop VGTs, and daily fantasy sports. Two additional land-based satellite casinos are currently in development in State College and Shippensburg.</p>
