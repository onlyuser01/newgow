<p>The perpetrator owned an illegal gun and used it to threaten the girl, the reports say</p>
<p>A Las Vegas convict faces charges of kidnapping an underage girl and forcing her into prostitution by threatening her with a gun. The girl was eventually able to return to her mother and provided the police with details about her kidnapper, Corey Canton.</p>
<p>According to the official report, on December 1, the police responded to a report filed by the girl’s mother in which the latter claimed that her daughter had been the victim of sex trafficking. As it turns out, the girl had, for unspecified reasons, run away from her family, which was staying in a hotel in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>While walking on the Las Vegas Strip, the girl met another female juvenile who asked her if she’d like to make a “quick buck.” While the eventual victim did not know what that meant, she went along with the other girl.</p>
<p>The Girl Became the Victim of Sex Trafficking</p>
<p>The two of them ended up in the Days Inn motel and met with Canton, who was the second girl’s boyfriend, the report says. Canton compelled the first girl to sleep with him and allegedly prevented her from leaving afterward by threatening her with a gun.</p>
<p>The two girls later went to the Luxor where they were paid $100 to sleep with a man they did not know. According to the police, Canton’s girlfriend stole $1,000 from that man’s pants.</p>
<p>On November 29, Canton had the two girls walk onto the Las Vegas Strip and offer sex services to men. According to the police, the criminal told them to charge $100 to $300 for the act. The next morning they returned to the motel room and were provided with some food, liquor and drugs before returning to the Strip.</p>
<p>In the end, the girl who had run away from her family was able to leave the motel room and reunite with her mother. The mother then contacted the police, prompting the investigation.</p>
<p>Canton Faces Seven Charges</p>
<p>The police raided Canton’s motel room and found the handgun the girl had mentioned. As it turns out, Canton was a convicted felon already and was prohibited from owning a firearm. Canton himself was later found in his residence in the 6100 block of Carmen Boulevard and taken into custody.</p>
<p>He now faces a number of charges, including two counts of sex trafficking of a minor, assault with a deadly weapon, two counts of kidnapping of a minor and owning a gun by a prohibited person.</p>
<p>Canton is held in jail on a $25,000 bail as of the time of this writing. He is set to appear before court on Monday.</p>
