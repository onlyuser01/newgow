<p>Tencent has announced the addition of Qualcomm, a company empowering mobile gamers through hardware, as a title sponsor for the currently-in-progress PUBG Mobile World League.</p>
<p>Tencent has revealed Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite Gaming as the official sponsor of the upcoming PUBG Mobile World League (PMWL) season zero. Qualcomm is popular for its work on Snapdragon semiconductors used in mobile devices and allows gamers to experience PUBG in an environment tailored to their specific gaming needs.</p>
<p>The company has invested in the Snapdragon Elite Gaming that makes it possible for players to have a rewarding experience playing PUBG Mobile without damaging their central processing units. Meanwhile, the PMWL is no small affair, as it runs a hefty prize pool worth $850,000. While the league should have taken place in a land-based venue originally, these plans have been disrupted by the novel coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Originally, the event was supposed to take place in Katowice, Poland, but it has since been promoted as an online event only. According to Tencent, Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite Gaming allows players to enjoy a smooth experience and transform their mobile phones into fully-fledged gaming machines.</p>
<p>The PMWL will finish on August 9 promoting a winner from each division who will meet in the finals for a chance to bite out of the prize pool. PUBG Mobile has been tremendously popular in Southeast Asia, as well as India, where the game has found a loyal consumer base.</p>
<p>The event features a lot of local talent and it’s cast by James “Kaelaris” Carrol and analyzed by Martin “Avnqr” Gøth and Patrick “Frosz” Iu. The league kicked off earlier this month and is also sponsored by Mountain Dew, a carbonated soft drink. The event is in the so-called League Play leg of the competition where all 20 teams have been split into five groups, based on their Opening Weekend placement.</p>
<p>The winner of the event will claim $100,000 in prize money with teams from 9th through 16th spot claiming a consolatory prize worth $2,000.</p>
