<p>The leading betting and gaming operators, BetMGM and MGM Resorts International, announced the launch of their responsible gaming campaign at nine different National Football League (NFL) stadiums. The new campaign seeks to promote GameSense, their popular responsible gaming program, throughout the football season by providing vital information and debunking misconceptions. The launch of the responsible gaming campaign designates MGM Resorts and BetMGM as one of the first leading gaming operators to support responsible gaming via marketing initiatives at NFL stadiums.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new campaign, GameSense will be promoted via the State Farm Stadium (Arizona Cardinals), Nissan Stadium (Tennessee Titans), M&amp;T Bank Stadium (Baltimore Ravens), as well as MetLife Stadium (New York Jets). GameSense will also be promoted at the GHEA Field at Arrowhead Stadium (Kansas City Chiefs), Empower Field at Mile High (Denver Broncos), Ford Field (Detroit Lions), Acrisure Stadium (Pittsburgh Steelers) and Allegiant Stadium (Las Vegas Raiders), a statement reveals.</p>
<p>The collaboration comes at a time when BetMGM and MGM Resorts joined forces with the American Gaming Association (AGA) for the promotion of Responsible Gaming Education Month (RGEM 2023) this September. During the month, the leading gaming companies will promote responsible play via regulated markets and improve employee training. Ultimately, those efforts further complement their commitment to responsible gambling.</p>
<p>GameSense was first developed a few years ago and since then has undergone updates and improvements. The program encourages proactive conversations as well as transparent and positive information on how to gamble responsibly, as well as the promotion of responsible gaming messages and tips.</p>
<p>Currently, GameSense messaging is distributed via MGM Resorts' casino floors. Slot machines around gambling venues offer QR codes that display educational materials, responsible gaming information and messages. On the other hand, BetMGM's mobile and desktop platforms, as well as sports betting kiosks, feature GameSense messages that encourage users to gamble responsibly.</p>
<p>Casey Clark, AGA's Senior Vice President, shared his excitement, saying: "The AGA is proud to work alongside leaders like MGM Resorts and BetMGM to advance responsible gaming every day. Their continued investment to elevate responsibility exemplifies the industry's commitments and the spirit of Responsible Gaming Education Month."</p>
<p>Rhea Loney, BetMGM's Chief Compliance Officer, added: "This is an extraordinary moment as we work with our team partners to raise awareness about responsible gaming." Finally, she pointed out: "Throughout the season, GameSense will play a pivotal role in reminding football fans who bet, to do so responsibly."</p>
<p>Stephen Martino, MGM Resorts' SVP Chief Compliance Officer, was similarly excited and acknowledged the growth of the iGaming and betting sector over the last few years. He explained that the new collaboration will help promote responsible gaming and predicted that the campaign will help more people enjoy gambling responsibly.</p>
