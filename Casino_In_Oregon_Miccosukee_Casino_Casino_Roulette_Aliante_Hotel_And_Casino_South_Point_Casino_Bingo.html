<p>It’s been 20 months since the last Philadelphia Eagles vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers game. The two meet again on Monday, September 25, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida</p>
<p>Both the Philadelphia Eagles and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been great so far in the 2023 NFL, each with a 2-0 record. Last season’s NFC champions have been great offensively, while the Bucs have been sensational defensively. Their MNF duel in Week 3 is guaranteed to be a fun affair, but which team will triumph in the end?</p>

<p>The Birds are Coming to Florida to Grab Another Win</p>
<p>The NFC champions did great offensively in the two games they’ve played so far in the 2023 season. Their quarterback Jalen Hurts threw 22-for-33 for 170 yards and one touchdown (caught by DeVonta Smith) in the 25-20 win over the New England Patriots in the first gameweek.</p>

<p>In week 2, they beat the Minnesota Vikings 34-28 with Hurts throwing 18-for-23 for 193 yards, one touchdown (Smith), and one interception. He wasn’t too impressive passing-wise, but he was brilliant when it came to rushing. The QB recorded two rushing TDs on 12 carries. Another rushing TD was scored by D’Andre Swift.</p>
<p>Their defense, however, wasn’t too impressive so far. These guys have conceded way more points than expected, but this shouldn’t worry them too much. Why? Because the Bucs aren’t too dangerous offensively.</p>
<p>Tampa’s Toughest Challenge So Far</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are 2-0, but the fact is that they haven’t faced too tough opponents so far. In the first round, they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 20-17, while in the second round, we saw them beat the Chicago Bears 27-17.</p>
<p>Tampa’s new quarterback Baker Mayfield has been pretty decent so far, but the fact is that he hasn’t played against too good defenses. He’s 10th in the NFL in QBR, but we doubt he’s going to stay there for too long.</p>
<p>Sure, given that Philly’s defense isn’t great in 2023, we could see Mayfield &amp; Co. score a touchdown or two, but we doubt their defensive colleagues can stop Philly.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Prediction</p>
<p>The Eagles have a much better roster than the Bucs in 2023. They’ve got a fantastic offensive team that seems capable of scoring 20+ points against literally any opponent in the NFL. Their offense hasn’t been too impressive, but we do think they can stop Tampa’s offense.</p>
<p>Picks: Philadelphia Eagles to win and cover the spread</p>
