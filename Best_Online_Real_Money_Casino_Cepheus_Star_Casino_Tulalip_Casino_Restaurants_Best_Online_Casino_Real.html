<p>The specific jackpot was $1,016,715.91, according to KENS, a Texas TV station. Details were not released. The game was developed by Las Vegas-based Light &amp; Wonder. It was formerly known as Scientific Games until a rebranding.</p>
<p>The Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas operates the Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel. It is based in Eagle Pass, Texas. Eagle Pass is about 142 miles southwest of San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Last month, another Dancing Drums Explosion player won big at The Venetian Las Vegas. It was from a $5.88 bet. The winning total was $2,835,768, the casino revealed. The Venetian didn’t identify the winner, nor did it release on which day the money was won.</p>
<p>In 2020, a player at the Bellagio Resort and Casino in Las Vegas won $3,934,609.07 on a Dancing Drums Explosion game.</p>
<p>What’s in a Name</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s name change became official earlier this year. Its shares are traded on the Nasdaq exchange. As part of the reorganization, in 2021, Scientific Games sold off its lottery and sports betting businesses for $7.2 billion.</p>
<p>The lottery business was sold to Brookfield Business Partners, a private equity firm, for $6.1 billion. The sports betting unit was sold to Endeavor Group Holdings for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The money generated in the transaction was used to pay off company debt. In April, the gaming company said its outstanding debt was $4 billion. That was down sharply from $8.8 billion at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder also announced the acquisition of privately held technology provider House Advantage in October. Last December, Light &amp; Wonder abandoned its bid for SciPlay, an effort to further expand into digital gaming.</p>
<p>In July 2021, Scientific Games offered an 11% premium to acquire the 19% of SciPlay it didn’t already own. SciPlay investors would have received 0.25 Scientific Games shares for each of their shares.</p>
