<p>Alpha Gold review</p>
<p>Alpha Gold transports players to an ancient Greek world of decadence.</p>
<p>Players will wander among stone pillars and meet a mysterious king, perhaps King Midas himself. Together, they’ll feast on grapes and learn the secrets of the king’s golden touch.</p>
<p>Fans of ancient Greek mythology will appreciate this slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Alpha Gold has a regal tone that will get players in the mood to have an indulgent feast. As the reels spin, players will hear harp notes and chimes celebrate wins.</p>
<p>Classical pillars surround the reels and a toned man sits on a throne at one side. His golden crown, crimson toga, and cavalier posture suggest that he is royalty. Vines and flowers accent the scene and a blue sky is visible in the distance.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will find golden statues, treasure chests, and ripe grapes. A variety of stone letters appear, bringing to mind ancient Latin writing.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation of Alpha Gold create a luxurious vision of the ancient Greek world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Alpha Gold is a five-reel, four-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel. In total there are 1024 ways to win.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols disappear, allowing new symbols to fall in from above.</p>
<p>The maximum win for this slot is 6,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols with the exception of the Scatter symbol and the coin symbol. Wilds can land on reels 2-4.</p>
<p>Players can trigger the Alpha Respins Bonus by landing at least 6 Coin symbols. The triggering symbols remain in place for the duration of the feature.</p>
<p>The Alpha Respins Bonus begins with 3 Respins, and Coin symbols will have values ranging from 0.5x to 250x. Whenever a Coin symbol lands, the Respins counter will resette to 3. Each Coin symbol will also remain sticky on the reels.</p>
<p>The Alpha Respins feature continues until players run out of respins, or when they have entirely filled the reels with Coin symbols.</p>
<p>The Alpha Super Bonus is triggered if players entirely fill the reels with Coin symbols during the Alpha Respins Bonus. During this feature, all Coin values on the reels are replaced by the highest visible Coin value. During Respins, only Coin symbols can land.</p>
<p>If fewer than 6 Coins land on the reels, players may be awarded the Coin values at random.</p>
<p>The Golden Free Spins feature is triggered if players land at least 3 Midas Hand Scatters. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of triggering Scatters as follows:</p>
<p>3 Scatters = 12 free spins</p>
<p>4 Scatters = 18 free spins</p>
<p>5 Scatters = 24 free spins</p>
<p>Whenever a new Scatter lands, an additional free spin is awarded. While the Golden Free Spins is active, every Cascade will increase a win multiplier starting from 1x up to 10x.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.80%, slightly below our yardstick for a average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.40 up to a maximum of $/£/€200 per spin.</p>
<p>Alpha Gold offers high volatility which is the level of volatility aligned with our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility, ancient Greek culture-themed slot.</p>
<p>Although the serene atmosphere and vivid animation are enticing, the RTP of this slot falls slightly short.</p>
<p>Some players may still like dropping by to try out the creative bonuses —and enjoy the ancient world vibes.</p>
