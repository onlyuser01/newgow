    <h1>Foxwoods Casino Map Casino In Wisconsin Dells Who Owns The Bellagio Hotel And Casino Manhattan Casin</h1>

<p>BGaming continues to grow its iGaming footprint as the studio has received an official Type A1 supplier license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission, Greece’s national gambling regulator. As a result, BGaming will be able to enter a new market and bring along with it a diversified portfolio of over 70 games, marked by their high customization qualities.</p>
<p>This will include games such as Fruit Million, Elvis Frog in Vegas, Aloha King Elvis, and other products that will now be made available to local players. BGaming has stated that it would also seek to explore exclusive releases that will only be available to Greek audiences.</p>
<p>Expanding BGaming’s Offer Through Licensing Agreements</p>
<p>BGaming operates a portfolio of HTML5 products and it’s one of a growing number of suppliers to explore cryptocurrencies as a viable payment method in regulated jurisdictions. BGaming styles itself as a crypto gaming pioneer as testified by its endorsement of the tech. Commenting on this launch, BGaming executive director Marina Ostrovtsova said:</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to be awarded a license by the Hellenic Gaming Commission and be able to provide our content to this regulated market. It is a great step for the studio, and for sure BGaming will continue to ride for our regulatory market journey.” BGaming executive director Marina Ostrovtsova</p>
<p>BGaming has been actively seeking to expand its offering of products. Over the past year, BGaming introduced ten new games and received a license from the Malta Gaming Authority, once again boosting the company’s reach.</p>
<p>Among the latest releases is Bonanza Billion with BGaming planning to release a crash-style game, Space XY, early in 2022. Crash games have become particularly successful with the introduction of those games by FunFair Games. Presently, BGaming’s products are available at 550 online casinos globally as per the company’s own account.</p>
