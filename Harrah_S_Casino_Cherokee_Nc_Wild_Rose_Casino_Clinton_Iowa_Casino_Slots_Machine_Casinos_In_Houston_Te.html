    <h1>Harrah S Casino Cherokee Nc Wild Rose Casino Clinton Iowa Casino Slots Machine Casinos In Houston Te</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You should never reverse the withdrawal because you will always lose. You should just not play and wait it's paid. Personally I didn't deposit there since I'm waiting and I won't until it's paid out. But I feel your pain because it happened to me also in the past. I hope you are fine because 2200 euros is a very big amount.</p>
<p>Although I have the same feeling as you, they do not pay and find excuses just so you reverse it and lose, this way they don't have to pay.</p>
<p>I find it really suspicious that you take 3 weeks to fix a problem with bank. If my bank was taking so much time I would have changed the bank. Not to mention that I proposed to switch payment to neteller which is instant and it has been a week, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be 3 weeks exactly since I'm waiting.</p>
<p>Also if they want to be fair, since you have problems with banks and payments, they should not allow people to deposit until it's fixed but they allow people to deposit money knowing they have problems with withdrawals. Sounds pretty like a scam.</p>
