    <h1>Casino In Los Angeles Wildrose Casino The Palace Casino New York New York Hotel And Casino 101 Bay C</h1>

<p>It seemed like the two parties were generally happy with the state of affairs, adding an aura of mystery as to what triggered the current lawsuit</p>
<p>Entain seems to have a quarrel with the former owners of BetCity, a Netherlands-facing gambling brand currently owned by Entain. As reported by CasinoNiews, a Dutch gambling-oriented website, a lawsuit was filed by Entain on December 7, 2023.</p>
<p>CasinoNiews explained that the report has been filed in the UK’s Commercial Court, a court focused specifically on commercial law. The case bears the case number CL-2023-000850 and concerns a Part 7 Claim, a claim that refers to a matter where going to court is unavoidable. Additionally, the lawsuit implies that it concerns a dispute over a commercial contract, which likely refers to Entain’s acquisition of BetCity.</p>
<p>However, CasinoNiews was unable to confirm the exact thing Entain accuses the Sports Entertainment Media of.</p>
<p>For reference, Entain completed the acquisition of BetCity in early 2023 after agreeing to an initial consideration of €300 million (then roughly $324 million), and a maximum deferred contingent consideration of €550 million ($594 million) in June 2022.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like the two parties were generally happy with the state of affairs, adding an aura of mystery as to what triggered the current lawsuit.</p>
<p>CasinoNiews was able to confirm that Entain will be assisted in the case by Clifford Chance, an international law firm. In the meantime, Sports Entertainment Media will be represented by Sidley Austin, another major law firm.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also summons individual Sports Entertainment Media shareholders, including the Singels family and former BetCity leaders, such as the company’s ex-chief executive officer Melvin Bostelaar, and ex-marketing director Robert Kooiman.</p>
<p>The Dutch news outlet tried to contact BetCity’s former owners but they refused to comment on the matter. Entain also could not respond to inquiries.</p>
<p>For reference, BetCity is among the biggest gambling companies in the Netherlands. As one of the original ten online casino licensees, the brand commands a significant market share in the country, which now helps Entain reinforce its international presence.</p>
<p>Speaking of Entain, the company recently withdrew from more than 140 unregulated markets. This move followed a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Crown Prosecution Service whereby Entain agreed to focus only on regulated markets and withdraw from all unregulated ones, except those that have prospects of regulating gambling soon.</p>
