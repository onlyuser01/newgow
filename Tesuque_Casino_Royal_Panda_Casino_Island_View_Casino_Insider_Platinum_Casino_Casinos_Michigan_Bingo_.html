    <h1>Tesuque Casino Royal Panda Casino Island View Casino Insider Platinum Casino Casinos Michigan Bingo</h1>

<p>The Casino ran a promotion stating that if you made a deposit with your Mastercard. You would receive a $20.00 if not more bonus on top of your deposit. Then once the deposit was made, you then had to go to the help desk and open a ticket right after your deposit is made. stating you made a deposit for the $20 Mastercard Promo and submit the ticket. With all that, I was fine, After I made my deposit, and went to open a ticket and filled out the information needed. I went to hit the submit button, but nothing happened. The page timed out. I tried again and again and waited for still the same result. Now mind you at this time, I could do everything else on the casino site. Play games, make deposits, etc..etc... just not able to submit tickets. I tried different browsers and even on my phone, ... the same result. Sound really Shady...I think so. So as life is, I was busy and didn't have to wait or go through a long chat session with an online person. First thing this morning, I tried again, the same result. I chatted with an agent and was told right away that I needed to submit the ticket right after the deposit, not the next day like now. However, even though I never was able to submit a ticket for the bonus money. The agent tried to pin the blame on my software and laptop and cell phone. Said " I can see the attempt you make 15 min ago to submit the ticket, but it needs to be submitted right after the deposit. Now, I asked him, if you can see my attempt to submit this ticket, then I am sure you can see the multiple attempts yesterday, right after I made the deposit. Naturally, he said " No, he could not" and just repeated the deposit policy to me about the bonus and sent me a link to the policy and rules as well. I am not stupid if it quacks like a duck , then its a duck.</p>
