<p>The global gaming content and premium technology provider for the gambling industry, Aristocrat Gaming, announced two key appointments as a part of its leadership team.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Unveils Senior Leadership Team Appointments</p>
<p>The company announced Wednesday that it selected Mark Wadley to serve as its chief marketing officer (CMO). Additionally, Aristocrat revealed it appointed Deanne McKissick as chief supply chain officer. The duo is going to report directly to Aristocrat Gaming’s CEO, Hector Fernandez.</p>
<p>In his new position, Wadley will be spearheading the company’s marketing efforts. Moreover, he will seek to “maximize the value of the Gaming division and products,” at a global scale, Aristocrat explained. Before being appointed CMO, Wadley served as VP of marketing for the Americas Region. He initially joined Aristocrat in 2020 and since then he was in charge of overseeing the company’s marketing strategy, partnerships and branding for the region. As a result, he helped set a “course for new branding, established innovative consumer-facing partnerships and built an outstanding team of professional marketers.” Besides at Aristocrat, Wadley held key leadership roles as a part of Medivation, Amgen and bluebird bio. Currently, he has a Bachelor’s Degree in Purchasing and Logistics Management from Arizona State University.</p>
<p>Deanne McKissick to Oversee the Company’s Global Supply Chain</p>
<p>On the other hand, McKissick will be in charge of Aristocrat’s global supply chain. As chief supply chain officer, she will collaborate with the company’s partners and ensure the products they receive meet their expectations. Overall, she was a part of Aristocrat for more than seven years.</p>
<p>Before being selected as the company’s new chief supply chain officer, McKissick held the position of SVP of supply chain and customer order execution for the Americas region. Her professional background includes nearly 14 years until May 2015 with the leading IT services and IT consulting company, Hewlett-Packard. During her tenure at the company, she held key leadership roles.</p>
<p>Aristocrat’s CEO Welcomes the Duo to the Leadership Team</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement regarding the two appointments, Aristocrat’s CEO revealed that both McKissick and Wadley will help the company continue to grow. Fernandez pointed out that the company is delighted to have the duo join its global gaming leadership team. In conclusion, he predicted that the duo will “continue to inspire our employees, vendors, partners and customers to reach new heights.”</p>
<p>“Deanne and Mark’s backgrounds lend a unique perspective to help take our business to the next level.” Hector Fernandez, CEO at Aristocrat Gaming</p>
