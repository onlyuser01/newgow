<p>Thought of as the biggest fixture in English soccer, Manchester United vs Liverpool is a rivalry that started back in 1894. Over the following 127 years, the two have met 207 times in all competitions, with Manchester United leading the all-time series 81-68-58.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, Liverpool has been more dominant. In fact, the Reds won two of the previous three Premier League clashes with Manchester United.</p>
<p>Is another win on the way? Let‚Äôs find out!</p>

<p>Manchester United May Be Worse Than What the Record Shows</p>
<p>The Red Devils are in a celebratory mood after coming back from 2-0 down in the Champions League last Wednesday. Ronaldo‚Äôs late goal brought them a 3-2 win against Atalanta.</p>
<p>He's done it again‚Ä¶</p>

<p>However, judging by what we saw in that game, there‚Äôs not much cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Manchester United players were horrible in the first half, especially on offense. The tide turned in the second 45 after Atalanta‚Äôs best defender, Merih Demiral, got injured. The former Juventus center-back was brilliant in the first part of the game, stopping the Red Devils from scoring on several occasions.</p>
<p>Without him on the field, Atalanta‚Äôs defense was unable to stop the home team from scoring three times. It was a spectacular comeback; however, there‚Äôs an argument that a team of this caliber mustn‚Äôt allow such things to happen.</p>
<p>Being 2-0 down at halftime is something that just would not happen if legendary Alex Ferguson was still in charge. However, with Ole-Gunnar Solskjaer at the helm, Man U doesn‚Äôt seem to have the fear factor anymore.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not just the Atalanta game ‚Äì we‚Äôve seen them struggling against much weaker sides in recent times. Actually, Manchester United has lost four of their previous eight games in all competitions.</p>
<p>The four teams that beat them are Young Boys, West Ham, Aston Villa and Leicester. All of those are much, much weaker than United‚Äôs next opponent.</p>
<p>Liverpool Looks Unstoppable at the Moment</p>
<p>April 4, 2021 ‚Äì that‚Äôs the date when Liverpool suffered a defeat the last time in a competitive game. Since then, the Reds went on to win 15 games and draw six.</p>
<p>WDDDWWWWWWWDWWWWDWDWW‚Å£</p>

<p>Liverpool make it 21 games unbeaten in a row.</p>

<p>Their most recent win happened last Tuesday, when they beat Atletico Madrid on the road. That‚Äôs an achievement not many other teams can brag about.</p>
<p>Not only have they been superb in the Champions League, but the Reds have also been killing it in the Prem. They‚Äôre currently in second place in the Premier League table, with just one point fewer than Chelsea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Liverpool is the only team in the league that‚Äôs still without a single loss this season. It‚Äôs very likely that the same will remain the case after Round 9.</p>
<p>The Reds are coming to Old Trafford to earn themselves some points. Whether it‚Äôs going to be one or three points remains to be seen, although I‚Äôm leaning toward the latter scenario.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool to win; we should definitely see Over 2.5 hitting.</p>
