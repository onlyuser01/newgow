<p>SkillOnNet is launching a TV spot which is designed to promote one of its brands in Portugal, as the company experiments with different forms of advertising</p>
<p>SkillOnNet will see a campaign roll out for its BacanaPlay brand with the initiative designed to highlight the “fun of playing at the online casino” during the summer months, the company said in a press release.</p>
<p>Building Successful Marketing Strategy on TV</p>
<p>There will be several versions of the ad that will roll out through September 30, with the first spots airing earlier this week already. The ad will also be available on Canal Hollywood movie channel, Fox Comedy, TVI, Fox, and SIC.</p>
<p>In the ad, casual players are featured as playing BacanaPlay on their smartphones and having fun. The tagline says, “Da um play na vida,” which stands for “play in life.” The advertisement naturally comes with all necessarily responsible gambling messages, as demanded by law.</p>
<p>BacanaPlay country manager Pedro Garcia has welcomed the opportunity to expand on this marketing initiative. Garcia said that the very name of the casino, Bacana, meant “cool,” and as such the new ad reflects the operator’s identity all too well.</p>
<p>“Since launching in Portugal, we have supported BacanaPlay with strong TV campaigns that have catapulted the brand into the public consciousness and quickly made it one of the most popular casinos in the country,” Garcia said.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet features excellent content with BacanaPlay, too, offering games by Play’n GO, and specifically title releases such as Rise of Olympus and Boat Bonanza. BacanaPlay has been live in Portugal for the past three years, and it has been leaning heavily on TV marketing, helping the company position itself as one of the leading local operators.</p>
<p>BacanaPlay is expecting to reach 6 million individuals and achieve 1.073 insertions with coverage of 3+, or in other words – each individual will see the ad three times.</p>
