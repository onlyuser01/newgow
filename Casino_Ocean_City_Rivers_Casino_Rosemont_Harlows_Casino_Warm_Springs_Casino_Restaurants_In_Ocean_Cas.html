    <h1>Casino Ocean City Rivers Casino Rosemont Harlows Casino Warm Springs Casino Restaurants In Ocean Cas</h1>

<p>Hi N1.</p>
<p>I would like to complain about an unforgivable experience.</p>
<p>The thing is that earlier today I deposited 100 euros at N1 Casino, with your Roshtein bonus which reads:</p>
<p>200% bonus deposit and 40x wager.</p>
<p>I'm starting to play at the Live Casino game Crazy time and I've been lucky. After 1.5-2 hours of play, with an average bet of 30-40 euros, I am now at 1,256 euros and I can see that the wager bar has come to an end.</p>
<p>When I initially pay to pay, it says I need to verify my phone number. For some reason I never receive this SMS (after resending it 3-4 times).</p>
<p>That's why I contact Live Support.</p>
<p>I ask about this with SMS verification, which they really just ignore.</p>
<p>Then I am promised that everything is as it should be and I will probably get my payout. Exactly "Your withdrawal is being processed".</p>
<p>A few hours later, I log in to my account again.</p>
<p>Initially, I am under I have 100 euros in my balance sheet. As a result, of course, I immediately go in and see my pending withdrawal, and can see that this one has been rejected. I now only have 100 Euro in my account, and not 1,256.</p>
<p>As a result, of course, I contact Live Support.</p>
<p>They tell me right away that my max bet has been exceeded, and point me to a page where I can see that the max wager amount reads at 5 euros / dollars. (So how much are they in the other currencies ??)</p>
<p>Fair enough, I have not complied with the bonus requirements and it is my own fault. What is not right is that:</p>
<p>1) At no time am I notified / warned that I will now exceed / have exceeded the max limit. (I did this in my very first bet)</p>
<p>2) I sat live, pretty much after every bet, and checked how far I had come against my wager ammount. Also, at this point in time it was not stated that my bonus was no longer valid.</p>
<p>3) Does the fact that I played for 1.5-2 hours mean that I played with "fake" money? After all, it could not matter how much I won, or lost per bet from here, since it was obviously never money I could make.</p>
<p>4) After "winning" the â‚¬ 1,256, I talk to the Live Support which in no way indicates that I will not get the amount mentioned. On the contrary, I am promised that I will probably get the money paid, I just have to be patient.</p>
<p>Letting a user believe they've won, as well as promising them that they'll get their winnings paid off, and then taking away all the winnings, doesn't sound like a legitimate way to run a casino in my book.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you and hope not least that you do the right thing in this situation and pay the promised amount.</p>
<p>Sincerely. A Tilted Player</p>
