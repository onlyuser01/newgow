<p>SmartSoft Gaming, a casino game developer and supplier, has teamed up with leading industry giant Entain. The partnership will see SmartSoft launch its full portfolio of games and incorporate a number of player-favorite products with Entain brands, including JetX. To start the partnership, the two companies will deploy games with the Crystalbet brand in Georgia.</p>

<p>SmartSoft Gaming provides a range of experiences, including live casino, slots, and traditional table games, all of which will be incorporated into the Crystalbet website. SmartSoft products will not be just limited to Crystalbet as they will also appear on other Entain operators, including Bwin, PartyCasino, and Sportingbet.</p>
<p>SmartSoft CEO Guram Gotsadze has hailed the opportunity to expand the companyâ€™s reach and portfolio pull with Entain. Gotsadze said that his company has an established reputation and that it thrives when it comes to non-traditional casino games, with a strong focus on continued innovation and user experience. He added:</p>
<p>Entain has been our great partner on a local scale and now having our games live on Entain brands globally is a fantastic opportunity and yet another endorsement that SmartSoft is the best-in-class. SmartSoft CEO Guram Gotsadze</p>
<p>SmartSoft will bring a range of additional and complimentary solutions as well to help Entain in player outreach and retention. Part of these tools includes promotional options that are specifically designed to improve customer loyalty and boost engagement. SmartSoft has described the deal as a significant achievement and expects to continue to collaborate with Entain with future releases.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Entain has dropped some big news itself, with the company launching an overhauled version of the Unikrn platform which it acquired last year. Unikrn, an endemic esports brand, has relaunched with a strong focus on a universal gambling experience that now features sports, skill-based wagering, esports, and casino.</p>
