<p>The New York Giants finished the 2021 NFL season with a 4-13 record. After two weeks of NFL action in 2022, they have a 100% win record. The question is how long will their unbeaten run last? As per online sportsbooks, it may last for another week – they see them as betting favorites in the only Monday Night Football game of Week 3.</p>
<p>The Giants are expected to beat the Dallas Cowboys on September 26, the main reason being that Mike McCarthy isn’t going to be able to count on his best player, quarterback Dak Prescott. Nevertheless, without Prescott on the team, the Cowboys were able to labor a big win in Week 2 – they defeated the AFC champions, the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>

<p>Cooper Rush Has Got Some Big Shoes to Fill</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are struggling with the offense this season. Even with Dak Prescott on the team in Week 1, they didn’t do much. With him out of the roster, they are expected to do even worse.</p>
<p>Prescott got injured in the first game of the season, after going just 14/29 for 134 yards, no TDs and one interception against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His replacement Cooper Rush threw 7/13 for 64 yards in the same game. With such poor passing performance, it’s no surprise that they lost 19-3 to the Bucs.</p>
<p>Cooper Rush was given the job of the starting QB in Week 2, and although he wasn’t too impressive, his team managed to beat Cincinnati. He threw 19/31 for 235 yards and one touchdown in that game. The reason why the Cowboys ended up winning 20-17 is that their rushing game was solid, while their defensive team completely outsmarted Joe Burrow and Co.</p>
<p>The Giants Favored to Win Their Third Straight Game in 2022</p>
<p>The New York Giants are off to a flying start in the 2022 NFL season. They are 2-0 after beating the Tennessee Titans 21-20 and the Carolina Panthers 19-16.</p>
<p>The Giants didn’t blow their opponents out, but keep in mind that both of those teams were favored to beat them. That said, going 2-0 at the start of the 2022 season is definitely a huge success for the team led by Brian Daboll.</p>
<p>With him as the head coach, the Giants aren’t playing beautiful football, but his strategy seems to be paying off.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys vs New York Giants</p>
<p>The New York Giants are allowing just 197 pass yards per game in 2022. Even with Dak Prescott in the QB role, the Cowboys would have huge problems against such pass defense. Rushing-wise, however, the Cowboys might do well, but probably not well enough to score more than a touchdown or two.</p>
<p>We don’t think that’s going to be enough. Although their defense will probably do a fine job on Monday, we expect the Giants to score just enough to grab their third win of the season.</p>
<p>Picks: New York Giants to win; under 39 points</p>
