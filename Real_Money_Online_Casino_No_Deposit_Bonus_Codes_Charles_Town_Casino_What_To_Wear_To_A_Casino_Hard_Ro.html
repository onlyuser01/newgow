    <h1>Real Money Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Charles Town Casino What To Wear To A Casino Hard Ro</h1>

<p>The only email I received was one telling me that "unusual activity" was flagged on my account. I did speak with online customer service last evening and was told it appeared that I was using "professional strategy".</p>
<p>Here is what customer service told me...... If the Casino considers a Player to be a professional (sharp), the Casino reserves the right to block the account. Also, the Casino reserves the right to invalidate all and any winnings and return the deposit to said Player.</p>
<p>We all would like to think we are Professional players, but in the end it is all about being on the right machine at the right time isn't it?</p>
<p>I believe the bonus I used at the time was a 500% match bonus, with a BitCoin payment.</p>
<p>My question is, why would they wait until I had won $1900 before their system supposedly detected some kind of unusual activity. Seems like they would have flagged me whenever this 'activity' started. Funny how they wait until I claim the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I would be happy to email you the online chat I had last night if you want the entire chat.</p>
