    <h1>Casino 777 Mount Airy Casino Golden Gate Hotel Casino Best Casino Game To Win Money Margaritaville C</h1>

<p>For everybody to see ive emailed this to casinoguru: ( for again casinoguru is declining my complaint for some reason that is not accurate )</p>
<p>Self exclusion only applies on casinosky. As seen on the screenshot.</p>
<p>Also the reason I closed my account was not gambling addiction related. As I should have send a email then tell them im a gambling addict. As shown also at the screenshot.</p>
<p>Its because I won 10k they just dont want to pay out my winnings.</p>
<p>I didnt had any gambling addicted behaviour at all. Even at casinosky I didnt had any addicted problems.</p>
<p>Ive deposit a few 100 and withdraw a few 100. I self excluded because the website the games didnt gave anything anymore.</p>
<p>If you self exclude/close account it doesnt says your a problem gambler. It maybe says in the description you think maybe you play to often. But it does not says im a problem gambler i have problems i lose to much money so I want to close my account!</p>
<p>If you want to self exclude on their website for gambling addiction you can contact support trough email.</p>
<p>And again if you self exclude it would only be on the website you are playing on not on the other brands of Sarah ltd. As again shown on the screenshot.</p>
<p>It really just is because I won 10.000 euro they do not want to pay my winnings. And flag me by no reason.</p>
<p>But I see casinoguru once again cant do anything. As I already knew. Because playboom etc is same brand and even there the casino doesnt response on any complaints. And have many blackpoints.</p>
<p>Fun fact is ive closed my account on playboom aswell last year. And I could play on casinosky what ever I wanted and withdraw as I wanted. But those were not huge amounts. But if you win 10.000 euro they flag you?. So you really dont see that is a scam? ;) .</p>
<p>Dont even know why im bothering with responding on this because obviously you guys are in favor of the casino's so often for ridiclous reasons.</p>
<p>They didnt even refunded me the 150 euro deposit as they refer too. Just ignore every email I send. And you cant contact live supprot when not logged in.</p>
<p>Im not making a second account just to chat with them because then they will say I had a duplicate account. Then they would have a solid reason and proof to convisticate my money.</p>
<p>150 euro deposit as a new member is not gambling addiction behaviour.</p>
<p>Self exclusion on a other website ( casinosky ) will not be put on all casino's of the sarah brand.</p>
<p>That selfexclusion was because I didnt like thenwebsite not because I was gambling addicted. I only deposit there a few 100 and withdraw a few 100.</p>
<p>Conclusion: if you win big on a other casino they flag you and say yes we take away your money and close your account for you for wellbeing?</p>
<p>Any blind man or woman would agree this is a scam.</p>
<p>And all you say is .. yes ive seen on the website of casinosky you can close your account indefinitely... so that means you are a gambling addicteded ( lol doesnt say anything but okay ) so we think paradisecasino is right to close your account and we close this complaint?</p>
<p>Like really casinoguru?</p>
<p>Such a waste of time again.</p>
