    <h1>Casino Close To Denver Colorado Funzpoints Casino App Download For Android Golden Hearts Casino Sunr</h1>

<p>Dear Arun,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about the issue and understand your frustration. I carefully checked the Bonus Terms on the website, and this is what I found https://fortuneclock.com/en/rules:</p>
<p>„10.2. Bonus money: wager (wagering)</p>
<p>The process of wagering a bonus means placing a bet on a certain amount, previously described in the bonus conditions. Please make sure that you have read these Terms and Conditions, or if necessary, consult with the support service. Not all bets are taken into account. The bets from table games (Roulette, Sic Bo, Baccarat, Live Casino and others), as well as from various video poker games are not taken into account.</p>
<p>The maximum bet amount to wager the bonus is: 150 RUB / 2 EUR / 2 USD / 9 PLN / 2 CAD / 3 AUD / 20 SEK / 10 TRY / 9 BRL / 30 000 UZS / 60 UAH / 8 PEN / 60 CZK / 4 AZN / 1 000 CLP / 50 MXN / 2 CHF / 200 INR / 250 JPY / 100 ARS / 3 NZD / 20 NOK / 40 ZAR.</p>
<p>In case of doubt, please consult the support service.</p>
<p>Each rate going to bonus wagering should not exceed 20% of the bonus amount. If the rate is 20% or more, such a rate will not count, and the status of the bonus wagering will be reconsidered."</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing higher than allowed bets, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to forward your game history in Excel format to petronela.k@casino.guru if you feel that you’ve been accused mistakenly.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue and receive your winnings as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
