    <h1>Ellis Island Casino Brewery Live Casino Hotel Red Dog Casino No Deposit Codes Wind Creek Casino Beth</h1>

<p>Dear casino guru,</p>
<p>i am suffering an extremely long and hard addiction with gambling despite putting multiple blocks in place, i am still able to create an account and gamble on roobet.</p>
<p>faults on my side:</p>
<p>Yes i am based in the United Kingdom which is a banned location on roobet</p>
<p>Yes vpn is prohibited, some accounts i have used VPN and some accounts i was allowed to open from the UK.</p>
<p>Yes i have opened multiple accounts under a false name.</p>
<p>Faults on behalf of roobet:</p>
<p>Having specifically told roobet that i am a problem gambler based in the uk and that despite having gamstop and bans in place which prevent me from gambling on any other site. Roobet still allows me to open accounts and gamble. Stake is a casino that used to Avoid KYC checks, but now even they have implemented kyc checks upon account creation due to this exact problem.</p>
<p>From the emails that i’m happy to forward, roobet is well aware that vpn is being used. However, they continue to let me gamble until i lose and my addiction gets carried away, at this point they simply block the account and say you’ve violated T&amp;C’s.</p>
<p>This is the MAIN PROBLEM THAT I WANT TO ADDRESS! Not only in my individual case but i also want casinogurus and the rest of the community to be aware of what is going on here:</p>
<p>I’m a problem gambler who has made over 20 accounts on Roobet. Each time i gamble and my addiction makes me lose more than i can afford i close the account and reach out to roobet to permanently block me and IP Ban me.</p>
<p>However, as any problem gambler knows, if the casino doesn’t have strict regulations in place or KYC Checks. Then all you have to do is create a new account with a false name and deposit and gamble away and roobet will not intervene unless either its a big win (where roobet blocks the account) or you make a complaint and roobet blocks the account based on T&amp;C’s violation.</p>
<p>Heres the big problem:</p>
<p>If roobet does not perform these kyc checks are required by the curaçao regulator, then how could they possibly prevent a gambling addict like myself to repeatedly create a new account.</p>
<p>I am well aware of the risks of gambling, but also aware that my account could be blocked and my funds frozen on roobet at any time due to T&amp;C’s violations. I am also aware that if i win big on roobet with one of the accounts then it will not be paid due to violations of T&amp;C’s.</p>
<p>However, I can still make new accounts and gamble and lose due to my addiction.</p>
<p>How is this something that’s allowed to happen. I fail to believe that roobet genuinely don’t see the flaw in this? It is purposely designed that way to skip KYC so that addicts like myself are drained of their funds.</p>
<p>In total Over all accounts i have lost close to £20,000. This cannot carry on, I need roobet to acknowledge their mistake, Permanently block me both Via IP Block and Through ID block. But neither of this will be effective in stopping me from re accessing the site unless KYC checks are done upon registration right?? If not the loop just continues of draining gamblers like myself.</p>
<p>on this recent account i have deposits over £3,600. Which i would like roobet to refund me. Also to Casinoguru staff, this needs to be made known to the community as well because vulnerable problem gamblers like myself are being exploited due to this "loophole" that roobet has designed and even stake has faced scrutiny and court claims recently for failing to perform KYC on registration which roobet are still not doing!!</p>
