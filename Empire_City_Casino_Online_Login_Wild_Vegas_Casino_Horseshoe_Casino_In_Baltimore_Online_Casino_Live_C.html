<p>The fast-growing developer of games for the online gambling industry, Gaming Crops, announced details regarding a new collaboration, allowing it to significantly expand the reach of its thrilling titles. The company revealed that it agreed to provide its full suite of games for the all-in-one casino aggregator, Uplatform.</p>
<p>Uplatform is known as an all-in-one platform that leverages innovative technology. Offering dynamic sports betting and casino platform, Uplatform delivers quality products and comprehensive solutions, powering the operations of betting and gaming companies. Additionally, the platform has its own casino aggregator, allowing operators to gain access to a wide range of content via easy and seamless integration.</p>
<p>Uplatform's Partnerships Manager, Guzel Vasikova, shared her excitement about the new collaboration with Gaming Corps in a statement. "It will be a pleasure to work with Gaming Corps, who offer first-class gaming content which I am certain will be very popular with our operator partners," she said. Finally, Vasikova pointed out: "This is an important partnership for us as we continue to grow and host more and more exciting games on our casino aggregator platform."</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Uplatform's customers will be able to tap into thrilling content from Gaming Corps. Such titles will include fan-favorite slot, table, crash and mine games. Additionally, the operator's clients will be able to tap into Gaming Corps' certified Plinko titles, as well as a wide range of thrilling and popular games, including Jet Lucky 2, Raging Zeus, Coin Miner 2 and Penalty Champion, among others.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Uplatform comes after Gaming Realms completed another deal, allowing it to expand the reach of its products. Last month, the company revealed that it joined forces with NetBet Italy, delivering its portfolio of content for the fast-growing operator. Thanks to this strategic partnership, NetBet Italy tapped into engaging, fan-favorite games from the iGaming developer, expanding further its offering.</p>
<p>Mats Lundin, Gaming Corps' Director of Sales, was excited about the new partnership with Uplatform. "Uplatform offers quick and easy integration of content for operators, with a growing library of games, and we are proud to be a part of that growth," he explained. "I look forward to offering more operator partners and in turn more players the chance to enjoy our growing and diverse portfolio of video and casino games content, and Iâ€™m sure our partnership with Uplatform will be very successful for both sides," said Lundin in conclusion.</p>
