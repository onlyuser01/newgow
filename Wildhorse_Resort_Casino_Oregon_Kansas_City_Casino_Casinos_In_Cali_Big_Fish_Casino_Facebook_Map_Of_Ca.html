    <h1>Wildhorse Resort Casino Oregon Kansas City Casino Casinos In Cali Big Fish Casino Facebook Map Of Ca</h1>

<p>The first golf major starts this Thursday. Augusta National Golf Course in Georgia is where some of the world’s best golfers will gather to compete for Green Jacket at The Masters 2022.</p>
<p>Among those is the current World Number 1 Scottie Scheffler, the former no.1 Jon Rahm, last year’s winner of The Masters Hideki Matsuyama, and many others. Even legendary Tiger Woods has expressed his desire to take part in the event, some 17 months after retiring.</p>
<p>There are so many amazing players heading to Augusta, but only one of them will win The Masters. Who is going to be? Let’s see what online sportsbooks have to say!</p>
<p>The Masters 2022 Odds</p>
<p>Golfer Odds Jon Rahm +1200 Justin Thomas +1300 Dustin Johnson +1500 Cameron Smith +1500 Scottie Scheffler +1500 Brooks Koepka +1900 Jordan Spieth +1900 Rory McIlroy +1900 Viktor Hovland +1900 Collin Morikawa +2200 Tiger Woods +5000</p>
<p>*Odds taken from FanDuel on April 5.</p>
<p>Where and When</p>
<p>Where : Augusta National Golf Course, Georgia</p>
<p>: Augusta National Golf Course, Georgia When : Thursday, April 7, 2022</p>
<p>: Thursday, April 7, 2022 How to Watch: ESPN</p>
<p>Can Matsuyama Defend the Title?</p>
<p>The short answer is: probably not. The long answer is that pulling off such a feat seems like too much of an ask for Matsuyama. After all, it’s been 20 years since a golfer won back-to-back titles at The Masters. The last man who did it was Tiger Woods in 2002 and 2003.</p>
<p>The #1 reason why the defending champ doesn’t seem capable of winning The Masters two years in a row is that the competition is fierce at the 2022 tournament. Further, Matsuyama probably isn’t in his best shape considering that he had spent most of the last 12 months struggling with an injury.</p>
<p>Jon Rahm to Come Back to the Top?</p>
<p>The former #1 ranked player is hoping to make an express comeback to the top. The trouble is that Rahm hasn’t been great in 2022, although we did see him do well at a couple of tournaments.</p>
<p>He does have the skills, as well as the motivation to win in Georgia, which explains why he is the betting favorite. However, if you take a look at The Masters odds, you will see that he is only slightly ahead of others.</p>
<p>The Masters 2022 Prediction</p>
<p>Brooks Koepka is a player that stands out. The guy has been brilliant at majors, winning four of them since 2017. Further, Koepka has finished in the top 7 in 12 of his previous 16 masters. With the odds of +1900, he definitely looks like a good bet.</p>
<p>Pick: Brooks Koepka</p>
