<p>BetGames.TV and Videoslots have struck a deal that will see BetGames’ entire portfolio launch on the Videoslots platform. Players will be able to access the games via iSoftbet’s GAP technology. The deal will help both companies reach new milestones and boost BetGames’ presence in the global market.</p>
<p>BetGames.TV and Videoslots Collaboration</p>
<p>BetGames.TV, a leading live distributor and betting games provider, has agreed to supply a complete set of good quality content to Videoslots, a leading iGaming operator.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, the supplier’s entire inventory will be available on Videoslots via iSoftbet’s GAP technology, enabling players to try out BetGames’ existing and upcoming games.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Videoslots will initially be only in markets covered by BetGames’ UK and Malta licenses, but it will also extend to BetGames’ aspirations in Sweden, where a license is anticipated soon.</p>
<p>The news comes at a moment when both businesses are seeing strong growth and major milestones achieved. BetGames is continuing to build on previous success. The company has appointed Andreas Koeberl as CEO, and Thomas Aigner was appointed as head of sales.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Videoslots has just passed the 5,000-game milestone the company offers to players., Players can now access BetGames’ catalog with games such as Bet on Poker, Texas Hold’em, and more.</p>
<p>BetGames.TV COO Aiste Garneviciene commented: “It’s fitting that our hugely popular products should be live with a leading brand like Videoslots. It will give our quality, innovative content the perfect boost to its exposure as we look to expand into yet more territories.”</p>
<p>BetGames.TV Many Achievements and Aspirations</p>
<p>BetGames is a multi-award-winning gaming company that has been nominated for seven SBC Awards in 2020 and has won two awards, “Leader of the Year” and “Live Casino Supplier of the Year.” The company signed a contract with Sunbet to expand the company’s footprint in Africa.</p>
<p>The company also intends to recruit over a hundred new staff, who will begin working in Malta and Vilnius offices. BetGames.TV will be able to continue thriving in the industry as a result of this change.</p>
<p>New employees will offer assistance to both new and current customers, as well as prospective partners. BetGames further plans to tap into large markets in Europe, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>Multiple jurisdictions have granted BetGames.TV licenses, including the UKGC, MGA, Italy, Colombia, and various South African gambling authorities, with Sweden to follow soon. The studio is the fan-favorite supplier for live dealer products in the global market.</p>
