    <h1>Cashman Casino App Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Big Bear Casino Murphy Casino Casino Slot Ma</h1>

<p>I play a couple of Free Tournaments- Didn't win anything. The casino sent me a $50 New Member Chip. I used it and won a Jackpot over $16,456.00 I didn't spend a cent from those funds. The terms and conditions were read. The customer service agents on 3 separate occasions stated I had used Too many Free chips??? ALL FREE chips show up in the transactions area. I only have 1 Free tournament are available FREE for ALL players and do NOT show up in transaction because they aren't transactions. Tournaments are only regulated if rebuys or add-ons paid for by a previous Free Coin etc. But once again those will show up in transactions area. At the very least I'm able to get $100.00 only after play thru requirements are met. (they were) Terms also state that if the exact same thing happens exactly the same as with me the player is allowed to request up to $500. None of the agents I delt with used improper wording and kept saying FREE tournaments are the same as Free coins. THEY ARE Not- This is my only transaction in my history: Sept. 25, 06:10 pm</p>
<p>Coupon MYFIRST50 redeemed</p>
<p>$50.00. I believe I should be able to withdraw the Free chip advanced amount of $500. The Jackpot was 16k</p>
