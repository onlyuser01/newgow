<p>Pragmatic Play has inked a new commercial agreement with GAMRFIRST, expanding its presence in Switzerland</p>
<p>The top-tier provider of content to the iGaming industry, Pragmatic Play, has announced it would expand its foothold on the Swiss territory as a result of a fresh commercial agreement inked with GAMRFIRST, a company under the operation of Barrière Group-owned Casino Barrière Montreux.</p>
<p>The news comes as a natural follow-up of the long and successful string of new agreements inked by the same provider including the live casino content deal signed with Bally’s Interactive last week and the Superbet agreement at the end of July.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the new commercial agreement is for the developer to continue to promote its development in Switzerland and beyond.</p>
<p>50 Pragmatic Play Slots, Live on GAMRFIRST.ch</p>
<p>The studio’s highly praised collection of slots has already gone live on the GAMRFIRST.ch platform, which is the online version of the brick-and-mortar casino provider.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the deal, 50 premium slots can already be played on the platform, with honorable mentions of games like Sweet Bonanza and The Dog House.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, Irina Cornides, spoke about the high reputation of Casino Barrière Montreux in Switzerland, where their studio has kept expanding its presence.</p>
<p>Cornides also expressed delight to add the operator’s GAMRFIRST brand to their constantly growing database of customers in the “key regulated market.”</p>
<p>The COO also acknowledged the shared “commitment to creating safe and enjoyable gaming experiences” with the online casino.</p>
<p>“A Wonderful Addition” to GAMRFIRST’s Roster of Games</p>
<p>At the same time, GAMRFIRST.ch’s head of online, Patrick Ballestraz, called Pragmatic Play’s portfolio of industry-leading slots a “wonderful addition” to their roster of games, praising the success their titles had already recorded among Swiss players.</p>
<p>Ballestraz also expressed their belief that the news of Pragmatic Play’s content being added to their online casino brand would be very well received by their customers who are already accustomed to the provider’s games.</p>
<p>With the help of the new deal, GAMRFIRST expects to keep building momentum while leveraging its stance on the iGaming market in Switzerland.</p>
<p>At the moment, Pragmatic Play released up to eight new slots on a monthly basis. The provider is also busy delivering Virtual Sports, Bingo, and Live Casino games, all belonging to its multi-product portfolio that can be accessed with the help of just one application programming interface.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Pragmatic Play announced all of its three verticals have gone live with Betwarrior Mendoza on the market in Argentina, following its launch in Mendoza with Super 7 at the end of August.</p>
