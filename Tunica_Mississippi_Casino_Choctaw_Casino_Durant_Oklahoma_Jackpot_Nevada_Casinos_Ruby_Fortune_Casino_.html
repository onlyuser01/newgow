<p>The NRL will use the planned 2024 Las Vegas double-header to gauge fan interest and pursue US expansion opportunities</p>
<p>Advertising and sponsorship partnerships represent just some avenues the League can reach out to US operators. Such efforts would primarily target US fans of the sport, hopefully capitalizing on the rapid growth of legalized sports betting in the country. The move likely comes as a response to tightening Australian regulations, which might impact the NRL’s significant betting-related profits.</p>
<p>USA Expansion Holds Significant Opportunities</p>
<p>Australia’s National Rugby League (NRL) is gearing up for the so-called “biggest event in rugby league history.” Next year, players from several high-profile clubs will travel to Las Vegas and host two blockbuster games, promoting the sport to an eager US audience. According to a recent report by the Guardian, the event will also be instrumental in establishing potential partnerships with leading US sportsbooks.</p>
<p>NRL Commission chair Peter V’landys has reportedly paid close attention to the booming US sports betting industry and is eager to secure lucrative partnerships overseas. Global Media and Sports strategic advisor Colin Smith speculated that the expansion could provide substantial long-term profits, but establishing it could take a while.</p>
<p>“This is really long-term thinking. Americans might be interested in following the NRL and having more games over there.” Colin Smith, strategic advisor at Global Media and Sports</p>
<p>An NRL partnership could benefit US-based sportsbooks in many ways. TV, advertising, and sponsorship partnerships are easy-to-spot avenues. Additionally, the League could sell game data and statistics. Such deals would primarily target the growing US market, potentially bringing significant dividends to the NRL and its potential partners.</p>
<p>Domestic Pressures Necessitate Diversification</p>
<p>V’landys’ decision to focus on a foreign market without the ability to directly engage with Australian sportsbooks may appear strange, but recent events in the country justify such diversification. The Australian government has been paying increasing attention to its struggling gaming regulators and is considering tightening sportsbook advertising restrictions.</p>
<p>The NRL already maintains lucrative contracts with most local operators, meaning that updated regulations can significantly impact its bottom line. In March, League representatives attended an inquiry on potential regulatory measures, indicating they might consent to tighter consumer protection measures. The anticipated financial hit may have triggered the NRL’s recent expansionist outlook.</p>
<p>US operators will likely be eager to partner with the NRL, obtaining exposure in the hard-to-access Australian market. The upcoming 2024 game will be the perfect opportunity to build excitement. Rugby’s similarities to Football mean US fans should quickly take to the sport. Meanwhile, NRL executives can meet interested parties and devise a win-win strategy.</p>
