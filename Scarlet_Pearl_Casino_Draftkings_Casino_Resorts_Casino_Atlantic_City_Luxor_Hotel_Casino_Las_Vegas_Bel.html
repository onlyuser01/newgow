<p>Paddy Power is convinced that the championship is on track to surpass last year’s record-breaking 901 180s</p>
<p>Paddy Power’s The Big 180 campaign continues to raise money for Prostate Cancer UK. As of the time of this writing, the initiative has raised £832,000 (roughly $1.05 million).</p>
<p>The campaign was launched in collaboration with Prostate Cancer UK and promises a donation of £1,000 for every 180 scored during the ongoing Paddy Power World Darts Championship. The operator hopes that the campaign will surpass its £1 million target by the end of the tournament.</p>
<p>As of the time of this writing, a total of 832 180s have been scored. There are still three matches left, meaning that there is still a chance that the initiative will be able to smash its target.</p>
<p>We’re well on track after the tally stood at £751,000 pledged going into the New Year, with that figure rising to £832k after the quarter-finals with three matches to go. Paddy Power statement</p>
<p>Paddy Power is also convinced that the championship is on track to surpass last year’s record-breaking 901 180s.</p>
<p>Paddy Power Urges Men to Take Care of Their Health</p>
<p>The campaign features a leaderboard where fans can see which players have contributed the most to Paddy Power’s charitable campaign. The lead is currently maintained by Chris Dobey with 43 180s. The second place is occupied by Scott Williams with 37, followed closely by Luke Humphries with 36.</p>
<p>Next up are the young sensation Luke Littler with 34 and Michael van Gerwen with 30 180s. Rounding up the top 10 are Dave Chisnall, Damon Heta, Rob Cross, Joe Cullen and Ross Smith.</p>
<p>The Big 180 campaign hopes to raise awareness of the dangers of prostate cancer and urge people to at least use Prostate Cancer UK’s online risk checker during the tournament. Laura Kerby, the organization’s chief executive officer, said that her team hopes that at least 180,000 fans will use the checker. She reminded men that prostate cancer is curable if caught early.</p>
<p>Matthew Porter, the Professional Darts Corporation’s chief executive officer, previously commented on the matter, saying that his team hopes that the millions of men who tune into the World Darts Championship will take the 30-second test.</p>
<p>Speaking of Paddy Power, the company was recently forced to shut down 21 shops across Ireland, leaving it with roughly 230 shops in the country. Back then, the company promised to redeploy as many workers as possible and provide compensation to the rest.</p>
