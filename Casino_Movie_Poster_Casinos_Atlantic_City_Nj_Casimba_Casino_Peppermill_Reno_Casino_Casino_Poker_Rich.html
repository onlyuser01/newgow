    <h1>Casino Movie Poster Casinos Atlantic City Nj Casimba Casino Peppermill Reno Casino Casino Poker Rich</h1>

<p>It has been sent.</p>
<p>It seems that they have now since today changed the live chat system for RichKing Casino so, that it looks like they are separated from 18bet and CasinoWinBig. They have also changed the way that they are hosted, you can now not see anymore that they are hosted on Delasport. Also according to WHOIS, is that since 6/12/2022 (the day that I did post here), so someone is trying their best to create a smoke screen. There is now Global Tech Markets showing. All evidence can be sent to you, if needed. But;</p>
<p>It are all very untrustworthy companies in my opinion, filed a complaint with Pragmatic Play because they are using fake slots of them. Pragmatic Play confirmed that, and contacted Delasport and RichKing Casino, some moments later RichKing Casino removed all Pragmatic Play slots.</p>
<p>The Delasport platform is getting used as casino platform for the mentioned sites with real slots that are licensed, and sites with fake slots and using fake license seals or no license seal.</p>
<p>The two sites are using Delasport their platform; I do have proof of that.</p>
<p>After mentioning that; they quickly changed department names of the live chat and blocked my IP address.</p>
<p>RichKingCasino is sharing highly likely the same management as 18bet and CasinoWinBig.</p>
<p>I would receive â‚¬600 deposits refund on the website CasinoWinBig.com (Green Team, or the new team: TM), received that after a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>On the website RichKingCasino.com (Black Team, or the new team: TC), where they are running fake slots and using a fake license, I would receive an deposits refund of 675 EUR within 180- days. That is only to let the chargeback period expire, and to sent no refund after that. I do read someone on the internet that has still no refund after 4 months!</p>
<p>They block me everytime from their live chat, and ofcourse when I do get blocked from their live chat at Rich King Casino, I'm automatically also not able anymore to start a live chat at Casino Win Big and 18bet licensed by the MGA (Shark77 Limited).</p>
<p>And Delasport, the casino platform where these sites are running on; they ignore everything. Every try with them failed, with no response.</p>
<p>Which makes them very suspicious in my opinion.</p>
<p>And Praxis Cashier, that is facilitating the cashier and payment process/transfer, they can also not do anything.</p>
<p>I hate placing an reviews like this, but there is no other way if they or their customer 1) ignore you, or 2) block your IP from their live chat, and 3) don't do what they promise, 4) are untrustworthy scammers that are using fake slots, and that decide to operate in forbidden countries and only paying customers when they are probably profitable for them.</p>
