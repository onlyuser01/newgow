    <h1>Win River Resort Casino Real Money Casinos Online Online Casinos That Pay Real Money Gold Ranch Casi</h1>

<p>I have been complaining about my 10 redemption which did not reflect in my account and all the response from their help centre chat and email are all.. frustrating.. my last email to them would describe said problem:</p>

<p>I have been complaining since February 6,</p>
<p>2022.. I redeemed a $10 poker bonus but it did not reflect on my account.. my friend redeemed $10 for a casino bonus more than once and he got them both $10 each time to play with..</p>
<p>I have been asking help In your chat but all I got</p>
<p>We’re all release restriction related information.</p>
<p>Which is implied on All the offered bonus available for redemption in the betmgm store, implying it’s bonus funds requirement before using it for other purposes such as casino or sport betting and before withdrawal of said funds giving its Release from it being Restricted from only one betmgm product(in this case from just poker)</p>
<p>Which only makes sense.. since you redeemed them from Betmgm store using hard earned points.. and what doesn’t make sense is what response I would get in chat to pay first before seeing the $10.. making the redemption of Hard Earned points useless.</p>
<p>And what’s more baffling is all the negligent response from chat after bringing up what’s written by begmgm such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The promo says "no deposit required";</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FAQ says "these rewards includes bonus funds for poker play";</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and betmgm store promo page says:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"Use your Poker bonus to play cash games or enter tournaments!</p>
<p>I surely hope you finally agree when I ask for the $10 to be compensated or just give me back my points.. I have been playing free tournaments giving movement to the promo page of the 10POKERSTORE.. not from any funds if you would check my history you will know..</p>
<p>Please and Thank you.</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>please help casino guru</p>
<p>i will attach some photos that are taken from their site which is for public information aside from the purchase $10 poker bonus - redeemed with 800 hard earned betmgm points..</p>
<p>I will send them to casino Guru as soon as I figure out how to earn and earn some points..</p>
<p>thank you kindly and best wishes to you guys!</p>
<p>yours truly,</p>
