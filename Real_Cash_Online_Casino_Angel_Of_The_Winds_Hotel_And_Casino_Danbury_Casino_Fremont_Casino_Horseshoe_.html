<p>Take the Kingdom Slot Machine Review</p>
<p>Take the Kingdom is an epic slot machine by Betsoft that will have you wield a mighty sword and try your luck at slaying a dragon. Or, failing that – stealing away with the dragon’s hoard would be just as good a result! In any eventuality, the kingdom is ablaze, a dragon is running wild, and there are tons of thematically appropriate and gameplay-enhancing features to explore.</p>
<p>With a maximum payout of 3,640x and Exploding Wilds &amp; Free Spins to try your hand at, this knight-in-shining-armor adventure will buck the trend and introduce you to pacey gameplay where you will face the fire-breathing drake yourself for a chance of turning a pretty penny in the end!</p>
<p>Take the Kingdom Theme and Setting: Protect Your Kingdom Against the Dragon</p>
<p>Or don’t – it really is down to you. Either way, Take the Kingdom is built to make sure that you are having fun! You are sent back in time – or perhaps you never left – to fight off a dragon who reigns his terror down on a medieval castle and the surrounding city. A noble knight, clad in golden armor and wielding a broadsword takes on this threat aided by bows and arrows, shields and swords, and maces.</p>
<p>The setting is not only thematic, but it also has a nice 3D touch that is so characteristic of the way Betsoft Gaming builds its game. Take the Kingdom slot offers a stout grid where a five-by-five action unfolds, with stone frames and a kingly statue carved into the frame towering impressively. Then, there are the soldiers who have rallied at the base of the grid and are marching against the fire-breathing dragon who pokes his head around one of the grid’s corners, looking villainously.</p>
<p>There is an animated fireball aflame showing the number seven as you prepare to dive into the gameplay and try your luck at getting a better value for your spins. These fireballs will trigger the exploding wilds every seven spins, which is a tremendous boost and adds to the fact that the game pays 96.54% on average!</p>
<p>In terms of setting, it’s hard to resist Take the Kingdom. The grid will also vibrate as if wobbling under the weight of the 5×5 symbol grid where each symbol is carved into a stone slab itself. The symbols and graphics, along with the animations are simply awesome, and if you come across a fire spurt shot by the dragon – breathtaking!</p>
<p>Take the Kingdom Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>To get a better idea of what to expect, it’s good to know a few things about the symbols, their payouts, and special purposes. To start, there are low and high-paying symbols, with the ones that pay the lowest being the letters and numbers, such as A, K, Q, J, and 10. They will pay out anything between 2.40 and 14.40 depending on how many of these you get aligned.</p>
<p>Then, you have the thematic high-paying ones which add to the narrative and make sure that you have an opportunity to build up your payouts. You get a bunch of armory and weaponry, such as swords, maces, bows, shields, and short axes that will pay from 4.80 to $28.80 for five of each. The even better paying ones are the knight who dishes out $48.00 for five of a kind, the princess for $57.60 if you hit five, and a whopping $168 for five of a king symbol.</p>
<p>This is not all, because you also have the golden chests, which are the Free Spins, and the Fireball Wilds which appear after the dragon breathes out fire to light up the regular Wild Symbols, which are themselves a small ball of fire.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations: Behold, the Dragon!</p>
<p>There are many dragon slots out there, but few are as fun or as worthwhile as Take the Kingdom. The story of a dragon who has overtaken an entire fortress and a king and his soldiers marching out to brave him is as old as the tale of Beowulf, yet Betsoft retells it with reinvigorated zeal.</p>
<p>The animations are not just showy, they are purposefully crafted to tell a compelling visual story, and they do. We truly appreciate every little decision that has gone into the designing of the game, such as the reels wobbling as the stone symbols come a-falling or the way the dragon peaks behind the reels, breathes out the fire or whips his tail across the air. It all contributes to a compelling experience.</p>
<p>Take the Kingdom Gameplay: The Knights in Incinerated Armor!</p>
<p>Take the Kingdom is a game that is played intuitively. Although the visuals are rich, they are still subtle enough to allow you to focus on the core gameplay more so than anything else. In terms of how the game plays, you should not have any issues figuring it out.</p>
<p>The spin button is prominent enough and setting the betting limits from $0.25 to $60 is easy and intuitive enough. There is a quick spin feature along with autoplay, that will allow you to sit back and watch the knights enter fierce clashes with the dragon usurper. All in all, the gameplay feels very familiar and plays very intuitively allowing you to have a blast from start to finish.</p>
<p>Take the Kingdom Features:</p>
<p>Take the Kingdom is not just an eye candy, it’s similarly a game that intertwines fantastic features into its core gameplay to build on both the way you experience the game in terms of rewards and visuals. Here are some of the great features to keep your eyes peeled for!</p>
<p>Free Spins: Free Spins are a core part of the game and are triggered with the Scatter Golden Chest. Three of these symbols will award you with 12 Free Spins and Wild Symbols that make it more enjoyable!</p>
<p>Fireball Wilds: Once every seven or so rounds, the Fireball Wilds will occur. This is when the Dragon takes a deep breath and expels incinerating flames to light up the stone slabs that contain a regular Wild Symbol shaped as a flaming ball and turn the grey reels into a cascade of payouts.</p>
<p>Buy Bonus Feature: If you are in the mood of just scooping up the Free Spins without having to get the Scatters first, there is good news for you! A Buy Bonus Feature is available in certain jurisdictions making it so much easier to skip ahead to the juicy level.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Only You Can Save the Kingdom</p>
<p>But if you fail to do that, you may try and get rich in the process. Take the Kingdom is about chivalry and questing to return to your home, but it can be about getting the most out of a bad situation. After all, when life gives you a dragon, make sure you know where its hoard is! Take the Kingdom offers a lot to do, see and enjoy. It’s a nicely animated slot that just feels right in every way.</p>
