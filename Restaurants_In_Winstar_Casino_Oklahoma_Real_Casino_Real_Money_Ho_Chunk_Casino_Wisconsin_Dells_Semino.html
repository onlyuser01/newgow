    <h1>Restaurants In Winstar Casino Oklahoma Real Casino Real Money Ho Chunk Casino Wisconsin Dells Semino</h1>

<p>I won $20000 after having my account active for a good while and previously cashing out like 4-500. Deposited a lot and wasn't having good luck. So I win 20k and whenever I tried to withdraw the money i am told I need to verify my identity. No problem. I sent the image of my passport, my utility bill and my picture standing next to a landmark in Dublin as requested. These items are approved, but they tell me they want more. They now want a picture of me, holding my passport as well as a piece of paper with the date on it. Again, no problem I do it, it is approved and AGAIN, I am asked for MORE. It's fully evident at this point that they are looking for a reason to not pay me out even though I very clearly follow the TOS (which I have read in their entirety). But rather try and wear me down by asking for more and more obscure items for me to send for verification. So the third request was for a picture of me holding my passport in addition to today's newspaper from my area with my name, the date and BITSTARZ written across the top. I did it again but this time the document was rejected because having grabbed the paper on my way home and the fact that I was due back at work away from home early the next day I didn't upload it until apparently after midnight on the date on the paper. While this slight technicality is annoying, I concede but now I have to go back to work which involves me being away from home for up to 3 months at a time. I put it in the back of my mind and figure I'll handle it when I get home. After a bit I returned home and got a paper and took the picture. Around 6pm I tried to log in to upload it, and to add a bit more juice to the process, an image of my original birth certificate, but my account was disabled. I began shaking I got so mad. And when I contacted them about the reason I was told that they couldn't provide details and the decision was final.</p>
<p>After a lot of research into people's experiences with them I've come to the conclusion they are selectively scamming. It actually blatantly obvious. They wanted any reason to not have to pay and I don't even think they had one so they just did it and said they couldn't disclose why. After letting me deposit over and over losing each time I finally win and this happens. It's so obvious these people are criminals. It amazes me these people continue to operate this way with impunity and no repercussions at all. The user base continues to grow because they have a hell of a marketing team, who ironically specifically seem to target players from the USA, which even more ironically aren't even allowed to play on Bitstarz. A friend of mine from America had a bitstarz account and was able to sign up fine from his home IP address so they let Americans sign up only to let them deposit as much as they can maybe even letting them cash out small wins knowing they will be able to close the account and steal all the money if the player ever gets lucky. They have great Devs so I know it wouldn't take any effort to implement a block on all known USA ip addresses seeing as creating an account from there, playing or even depositing is against the terms of conditions but doing it this way they know they'll still be able to get their money and never need to pay anything out they don't want to. It's flagrant, and I can't believe they're number one on all these sites. I sincerely hope that this website doesn't have an affiliate relationship with bitstarz because if they do then I know this post will fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>If you really are in the business of regulation of crooked casinos then I have all the proof needed to show I broke no rules. If you aren't then the battle is lost and let this be a lesson to anyone looking to play here.</p>
