<p>Florida Panthers Have Bad Memories from Their Trips to Vegas</p>
<p>The Florida Panthers have played five times against the Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena. They lost each time. Four of those matches saw the Panthers lose by two or more goals, while in one game (in 2019), they managed to take the game to penalties in which all of their players missed their shot.</p>
<p>On the bright side for the Panthers, they’ve been brilliant on the road this season. In fact, they’re 8-1 in away matches in the 2023 postseason. In the regular season, their record away from Florida was 16-3-3. However, they won each of their final four away games of the regular season which helped them book their ticket to the playoffs.</p>
<p>Vegas Golden Knights Ready for Another Brilliant Performance</p>
<p>The Golden Knights are coming off a 6-0 win over the Dallas Stars, which brought them the Western Conference title (4-2 in the series). It was a brilliant performance from the Vegas team, both offensively and defensively. Five different players scored a goal in that game, but neither Chandler Stephenson nor Jack Eichel was among those.</p>
<p>Those two are Vegas’s players with the most points collected in the 2022-23 season. Most of those they won through making assists. When it comes to scoring, Vegas’s best player is Jonathan Marchessault, with 37 goals in 93 games.</p>
<p>The Golden Knights have a clean bill of health when it comes to outfield players, but two of their goaltenders are injured. Nevertheless, those goalies that are fit have been doing great in the postseason. Adin Hill who started in the previous game, for instance, has a save percentage of 93.71% in the playoffs, allowing 2.07 goals on average. So far in 11 playoff games, this guy has managed to record a shutout two times.</p>
<p>Florida Panthers vs Vegas Golden Knights Prediction</p>
<p>The Vegas Golden Knights work great as a collective, which is their strongest weapon in 2023. They’re coming off a brilliant performance against the Dallas Stars, and we expect them to do great once again. They probably won’t be able to blow out the Florida Panthers, but we can definitely see them winning in regulation.</p>
<p>Pick: Vegas Golden Knights to win in regulation</p>
