    <h1>Riviera Hotel Casino Alhambra Casino Milky Way Casino Login Hotels Near Morongo Casino The Mirage Ho</h1>

<p>I am contacting you because I am having problems with a withdrawal with this casino.</p>
<p>I explain you</p>
<p>I've been registered here for almost two years, every now and then I deposited something, but I never won anything until the last time I managed to withdraw 159 euros</p>
<p>And here my ordeal begins, after the withdrawal request on January 22nd they ask me for the documents on the 23rd they approve them, however the withdrawal remains suspended and in the meantime both in chat and also a phone call from them asking for explanations of why the withdrawal and still suspended they tell me with great arrogance that since I have only paid 190 euros since I registered my withdrawal will be slow and they tell me that I have to increase my game by paying more money (which I don't do).</p>
<p>Finally on January 29th I see that the withdrawal has been processed so for the 31st I expected the sum to be in my account, but nothing.</p>
<p>So on February 1st I go to the chat and ask for explanations and they tell me that the withdrawal was authorized on January 31st and that they have a new payment method and therefore it will take time, but today February 3rd I have not received anything and they continue to say that I don't have to worry.</p>
<p>I have been playing in online casinos for many years and the first time that a withdrawal takes so long to arrive, and it smells like a scam to me ...</p>
<p>What do you advise me to wait or get interested in you, I keep all the screenshots of the chats and the various steps of the withdrawal... in your opinion, assuming I want to believe them and the withdrawal was processed on January 31st and it is never possible that today hasn't arrived yet...</p>
<p>I wanted to attach some screenshots but here it won't upload them to me if you give me an email I'll attach them there...</p>
<p>Thank you very much bye üëçüáÆüáπüåπ</p>
