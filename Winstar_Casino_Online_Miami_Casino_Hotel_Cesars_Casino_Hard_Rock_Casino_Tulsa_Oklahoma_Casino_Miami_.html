    <h1>Winstar Casino Online Miami Casino Hotel Cesars Casino Hard Rock Casino Tulsa Oklahoma Casino Miami</h1>

<p>I deposited $40 on this site. I wagered over $4,000 and have probably 5 or 600 left. I was doing fine last night till it said disconnected. When I log back in it shows my balance still at 200 and something dollars. However when I go into any game it says I have to deposit. Why can't I play the rest of my balance? This is pretty screwed up of them to do. But tomorrow I'm going to have the money reversed back to my account. This casino does not deserve a deposit from anybody. Their revenues are a joke. They run without a license. When you call they hang up on you. They have a rude live chat. They appear to be racist. If they hate Americans why they offer their site to us? I hope somebody sues the crap out of this place. And it might be me if I get pissed enough. I've also been known to do the reversal with my bank. You mess with the bull you get the horns</p>
