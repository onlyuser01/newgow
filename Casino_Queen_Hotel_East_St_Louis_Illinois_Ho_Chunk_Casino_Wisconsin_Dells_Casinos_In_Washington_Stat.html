<p>Provider of gaming technology and services Scientific Games (SG) announced today a new strategic move to expand into another gaming market and significantly enhance its product portfolio.</p>
<p>First Step into Live Casino</p>
<p>Scientific Games announced it would be entering the Live Casino market via the acquisition of the provider of premium live casino solutions Authentic Gaming. The acquisition is the latest step in the company’s strategy to become the leading cross-platform gaming provider on a worldwide scale.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have Authentic Gaming join the Scientific Games family and expand our premium product portfolio as we execute on our vision to become the leading, cross-platform global game company,” said SG chief executive officer Barry Cottle. “The collective power of Authentic, our proven Table Games titles and our OpenGaming platform allow us to capitalize on a growing U.S. market opportunity with our unique omnichannel approach,” he added.</p>
<p>Malta-based Authentic Gaming already made a name for itself as a trusted provider of live casino products for operators across regulated European gaming markets, putting player preferences at the heart of its products and services, while keeping a close eye on market trends.</p>
<p>Scientific Games’ leading position in the U.S., their focus on quality games content and market-leading iGaming platform make them the ideal home for Authentic to expand our footprint in the U.S. and European markets.” Jonas Delin, CEO and Founder, Authentic Gaming</p>
<p>With a reputation as a specialist in live roulette, offering casino players the excitement on both desktop and mobile, Authentic Gaming has integrations with over 30 European operators, including Entain, 888, Betway, LeoVegas and Mr Green.</p>
<p>Capture Growth Opportunities</p>
<p>Also commenting on the acquisition, SG CEO of iGaming Dylan Slaney underscored that, following the addition of Authentic Gaming, the company would be in a unique position to provide entertainment and capture growth opportunities in the Live Casino space, taking full advantage of the “convergence of players globally across digital and land-based channels.”</p>
<p>Authentic Gaming recently boosted its portfolio of cutting-edge titles and auto-roulette games with the addition of live Blackjack, while the company is planning to introduce live Baccarat in the near future.</p>
<p>Outlining Authentic Games’ proven technology and live dealer platform is ripe for scaling now, Authentic Gaming CEO Jonas Delin confirmed that the acquisition would support “studio expansion and game diversification strategy in full force” while the company is seeking to continue to deliver “premium quality live dealer content” with “attention to detail, customization and innovation” as its cornerstones.</p>
<p>“This partnership will propel this mission and be a game changer in the fastest-growing segment in the gaming industry,” Authentic Gaming founder Jonas Delin concluded.</p>
<p>Making the first step in the Live Casino market, SG is planning to boost Authentic Games’ product offering across US gaming jurisdictions by creating new studios that will enable the tech supplier to offer its US partners a localized product.</p>
