<p>Octoplay, an emerging iGaming studio and developer of content for online casinos, has obtained a license from the Swedish gambling regulator, Spelinspektionen. The company shared the news in a press release on its website, reaffirming its long-term strategy to position itself in fresh markets and seek to increase its footprint in regulated markets in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>Presently, Octoplay has secured licenses in the United Kingdom, Romania, and Malta, with Sweden only adding to the jurisdictions in which the company can legitimately bring its expanding portfolio of new titles. Octoplay is among the first companies to secure the license as part of the regulator’s call for renewals. This is an important fresh market entry for the supplier.</p>
<p>Octoplay is now in a position to bring popular choices, such as Pearly Shores, Hot Harvest, and Heavy Anchor, amongst some of the company’s most successful titles so far. Commenting on this new achievement, Octoplay Director of Business Development Ralitsa Georgieva welcomed the opportunity to see her company enter yet another regulated and highly-regarded market.</p>
<p>"We are proud to have secured the necessary approvals to supply our slots to Swedish casinos and to offer players there the excitement of our games for the first time," Georgieva said. Octoplay is a fairly new company as well. It was founded in 2022 by Carl Ejlertsson, an Evolution Gaming and Red Tiger veteran. The company is committed to bringing innovation to the sector and creating new products that strike home with target audiences.</p>
<p>Octoplay’s titles are already available at multiple leading brands, including Betsson. Since lifting the curtain, the company has been ambitious in growing its presence in the online gaming market. Octoplay teamed up with Soft2Bet in February and it secured an entry into the market in the United Kingdom in March.</p>
<p>The latest market entry into Sweden allows the company to continue growing its footprint methodically. The company has released 12 titles as of the time of reporting, with Mutant Potatoes, Spirit Blast, Mr Piggles, Aztec Ancients and others among its portfolio of trusted and exciting gaming products.</p>
