<p>Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and other PSG superstars travel to Southern France this weekend to take on their archrivals Marseille. Although they have a fantastic record against this opponent, the last time these two met – in the French Cup on February 8 – it was Marseille that won 2-1.</p>

<p>So Many Reasons for L’OM to Go All-In on Sunday</p>
<p>Olympique de Marseille players are going to be fired up on Sunday, even more than usual. First of all, Le Classique is the most intense game in France, but it’s Marseille players and fans who care more about it. PSG, on the other hand, are more into continental rivalries in recent times.</p>
<p>Another reason why L’OM are going to go all-in in this game is that a win could get them much closer to the No. 1 spot in the French Ligue 1. Right now, table leaders PSG have five points more than them.</p>
<p>One final reason why we expect Marseille players to give all they got in The French Classic is that it’s played on their turf. Their fans are famously very passionate at Velodrome, and we expect them to go one step beyond on Sunday. With the help of their supporters, L’OM won 7 home games in Ligue 1 this season, while drawing two, and losing three.</p>
<p>PSG Got Other Things to Worry About</p>
<p>When Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s Qatar Sports Investments (QSi) bought PSG in 2011, they made it clear that winning the Champions League is the No. 1 priority. Twelve years later, the club is still without the biggest trophy in club soccer.</p>
<p>And how things currently stand, they might not get ahold of the title this year either. Last week, they lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich at home. The rematch is played 10 days after Le Classique, but we think PSG players already have their minds set on the UCL game.</p>
<p>Lack of focus isn’t their only problem ahead of the trip to Marseille. They also got some injuries to worry about. Neymar, for example, is injured and will definitely miss this game. Not only is he injured, but he’s also reportedly disappointed with life at PSG, and is looking to move elsewhere at the end of the season. The same is suspected to be the case with Lionel Messi, whose contract expires in June.</p>
<p>Olympique Marseille vs PSG Prediction</p>
<p>Olympique Marseille scored two goals in four of their last five games in all competitions. We think they can do the same against PSG in Le Classique on Sunday. But will that be enough to win all three points?</p>
<p>We’re not 100% sure, considering that PSG have so much power in the offence. Still, knowing that the hosts are going to be super-motivated in this game, we think they’re going to win themselves at least a point.</p>
