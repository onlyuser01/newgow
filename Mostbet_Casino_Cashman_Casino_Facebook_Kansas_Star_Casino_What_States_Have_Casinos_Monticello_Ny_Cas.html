    <h1>Mostbet Casino Cashman Casino Facebook Kansas Star Casino What States Have Casinos Monticello Ny Cas</h1>

<p>I have been playing in this casino for quite long and i deposited hundreds or thousands of € here, that is why I have definitely NOT expected this.</p>
<p>I have received offer 400% bonus available for my next deposits, during next 5 days, each day available once. I reached support and asked if this is legit and was told, that he must ask the relevant department to be sure - I was unable to receive this bonus, UNTIL THE LAST DAY of the campaign, where i received it once - from the support, manually. (Lost this bonus without significant win.)</p>
<p>!! IMPORTANT !! I checked the bonus and its specific terms before - they were just common, not different from other bonuses here or elsewhere (= bets made from real AND bonus funds both count to the wagering).</p>
<p>Naturally, I inquiried about remaining bonuses and the bonus team replied (it was already after the campaign), that "the 400% bonus up to 80€" is available for me few more times.</p>
<p>I deposited, requested the bonus and received another bonus of 80€ (manually from support). I checked the terms and everything seemed correct, bonus was 400%, wagering from bonus and real funds, also it worked like that. I wagered a bit but then lost it.</p>
<p>Later I deposited again and again asked support to add the bonus to me. This time I was successful and I won like 1200-1400€. I slowly increased bet to 5€/spin (the highest bet possible while wagering bonus) and played a lot, until i was sure i met the 2400 wagering (80€ bonus * 30 (wagering) = 2400€).</p>
<p>Then I checked wagering and, to my really bad surprise, the wagered amount was only 20€!</p>
<p>I asked what should this mean and the carousel of excuses and wrong assumptions and incorrect statements just started.</p>
<p>I was said that this bonus is (surprisingly) WAGERED ONLY WITH REAL FUNDS.</p>
<p>(If you consider real funds are used first, and all WINNINGS GO TO BONUS funds, you basically need to deposit the exact amount of money that is required to wager - 2400€ in this case. What bonus ever worked like that?)</p>
<p>This is either totally incorrect, or absolutely sick, no-manner fraudster-like behavior - just my opinion.</p>
<p>I asked, why is this particular bonus different from the campaign bonus (actually also different from the other 400% bonus, that was added when the campaign was expired already).</p>
<p>To my greatest disappointment, the bonus team replied that this was not the same bonus like in the campaign and that the rules were different.</p>
<p>I can prove this is incorrect - I have received the same bonuses before and both, the one received during the campaign, as well as the one received manually after the campaign expired, were wagered the standard way. Same like many bonuses before.</p>
<p>And, also, I have received email where was stated that "I can use the 400% bonuses", not a single word about that the rules changed in a way that makes these bonuses absolutely unplayable, nor a single word about that anything changed compared to the standard campaign rules and bonuses.</p>
<p>Lastly, this last bonus was not even the correct one - instead of 400% deposit bonus is it shown as 100% No Deposit bonus.</p>
<p>It might seem like a minor issue with a bonus. However it actually is worth all the sum, as left € in the account are already wagered and withdrawable right away.</p>
<p>If the funds weren't already wagered, I believe that the ice would break much easier.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your cooperation and help regarding this case.</p>
<p>Evidence attached:</p>
<p>chat with casino representative where we were talking about the adding of the bonus, not a single word mentioned that it is different from the campaign one</p>
<p>first email screenshot mentioning that the bonus 400% is available to me, not a single word about the terms are changed (while they still were not changed)</p>
<ul>
<li>chat history before this email</li>
</ul>
<p>email mentioning that these bonuses are still few left for me (while the already spent bonuses were correctly added)</p>
<ul>
<li>chat history before this email</li>
</ul>
<p>email regularly mentioning that the bonuses were actually different with unplayable terms</p>
<ul>
<li>chat history before this email</li>
</ul>
<p>screenshots of the dashboard with shown current wagering</p>
<p>screenshot of the incorrect bonus added (NO DEPOSIT BONUS where only stakes with real money count)</p>
<p>screenshot of another bonus (exactly like this should be also the current one) - bets from REAL and BONUS count both to wagering</p>
<p>proof of manually added DIFFERENT bonus that was fully wagered ONLY by bonus funds (proving the stance of this being the standard incorrect)</p>
<p>maybe some others</p>
<p>(there was some issue while uploading the attachments and also there are too many of them and the allowed number is limited, that's why the format)</p>
