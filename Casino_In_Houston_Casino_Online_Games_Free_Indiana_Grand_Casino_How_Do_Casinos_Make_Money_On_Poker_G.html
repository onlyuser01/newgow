    <h1>Casino In Houston Casino Online Games Free Indiana Grand Casino How Do Casinos Make Money On Poker G</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am self excluded from multiple Dama NV casinos such as BitKingz. Axecasino who is owned by the same company allowed me to sign up, verified all my ID documents and allowed me to deposit $2800AUD in total. I ended up having a big win and got my balance up to $9050. I made a $3750AUD withdrawal as that is there daily limit and this never got paid after 2 days of waiting and the withdrawal being rejected about 10 times due to apparent technical difficulties. I stupidly played some of my winnings and ended up losing it all. I was sick of waiting for them to sort their crap out. I know it was my fault but it seemed they did everything they could do prevent me withdrawing my winnings.</p>
<p>Because I am permanently self excluded from BitKingz and other Dama NV casinos, I'd like to seek a full refund of all deposits I have made ($2800AUD).</p>
<p>Would I be entitled to this due to the failure to prevent me depositing at their casino?</p>
