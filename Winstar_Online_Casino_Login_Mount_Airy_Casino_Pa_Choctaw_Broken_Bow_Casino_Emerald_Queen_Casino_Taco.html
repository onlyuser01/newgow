    <h1>Winstar Online Casino Login Mount Airy Casino Pa Choctaw Broken Bow Casino Emerald Queen Casino Taco</h1>

<p>Well, this is a really frustrating situation, since on one side the verification is probably a necessary first step, allowing you to withdraw your winnings once it's successfully completed. On the other hand, this process should be initiated by the casino or at least you should be told what you are supposed to provide.</p>
<p>I did consult the casino's rules and found this</p>
<ol>
<li>KYC Policy - verifying your credential</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to prevent possible online fraud, we reserve the right at any time to verify the authenticity of your credentials, such as your name, address, age and payment methods that you use, requiring you to submit all the necessary documents for this verification.</p>
<p>These documents usually include proof of your identity, your residential address (such as a utility bill), and the method of payment you are using.</p>
<p>IDENTITY DOCUMENTS:</p>
<p>Photo ID. A copy of this document is required to process your first withdrawal request. This could be a copy of your passport, driver's license, or other proof of your identity. To verify your identity, we require a photo of your identity document.</p>
<p>Credit / Debit Cards: Copies of the front and back of the credit / debit card that you used to deposit into your gaming account. Before submitting a copy of your credit / debit card, please make sure it is easy to read so that we can verify your identity as soon as possible. For security reasons, cover the middle eight digits on the copy of the front of your card and the 3 digits of the security code on the copy of the back.</p>
<p>Proof of Address: For this purpose, you can send us your utility bill or credit card statement. This document should be recently received by you, and it should clearly show your full name and address, which you provided when registering your game account. If you are going to provide a credit card statement, you should cover the middle 8 digits of your card for security.</p>
<p>Notarized Documents: Your documents must be certified by the signature and stamp of an authorized notary / legal counsel to prove the legality of the documents you provide.</p>
<p>Attention! In some cases, depending on the method of payment that you used to make a deposit, you may be asked to provide one or more of the above documents or other additional documents not included in this list.</p>
<p>The player undertakes to provide information within 48 hours of receiving the request. These documents can be downloaded in your personal account. We reserve the right not to report successful verification results.</p>
<p>If the player refuses or ignores our request for the provision of these documents, the Company may, at its discretion, close his account and withhold all the money that will be in his game account.</p>
<p>If the documents you send us do not pass our internal security checks, for example if we suspect that you have sent us fraudulent documents, or that your documents contain falsified information or have been provided to us for the purpose of misleading, we will not must treat these documents as legitimate and inform you about this decision.</p>
<p>The verification process can take up to 48 hours. As part of the verification process, we retain the discretion to limit the withdrawal of funds from the Customerâ€™s account. The Company is not responsible for any delays in processing payments that may occur within a processing of KYC documents by our managers.</p>
