<p>Zhang Weili vs. Amanda Lemos is the co-main event of UFC 292, which is taking place at TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts on Saturday, August 19, 2023</p>
<p>Zhang Weili (23-3) is a two-time champion in the UFC Women’s Strawweight division, whose second stint started nine months ago when she defeated Carla Esparza. Fast-forward to August 19, 2023, and the Chinese fighter is defending her championship belt against Amanda Lemos (13-2-1), who’s never fought for the title since coming to the UFC in 2017.</p>

<p>Reasons Why Zhang Weili’s UFC 292 Odds are as Short as -310</p>
<p>Zhang Weili has proved many times that she’s one of the best female fighters in the world. She’s only got three losses in her portfolio, with one of those happening on her professional debut back in 2013. Since then, she’s only lost twice, each time to Rose Namajunas.</p>
<p>The first time it happened, Namajunas beat her by KO (head kick). The second time, it was a split decision loss. Both of those losses happened in title fights. In fact, five of Weili’s six previous fights were championship bouts.</p>
<p>The only one of those in which the championship belt wasn’t at stake was the fight against Joanna Jedrzejczyk a year ago, in which the Chinese fighter won by KO (spinning backfist), earning the Performance of the Night bonus along the way.</p>
<p>The impressive KO win is what recommended her for another title bout. As a result, she took on then-reigning champ Carla Esparza in November 2022. After six minutes and five seconds of fighting, Weili won by submission (rear-naked choke) – her first win by this method since 2018.</p>
<p>Amanda Lemos Fighting for UFC Title for the First Time</p>
<p>Amanda Lemos is a former Jungle Fights champion who joined the UFC in 2017. Since then, she’s 7-2, with losses to Leslie Smith (TKO) and Jessica Andrade (submission). In each of her previous two fights, she won by stoppage, which is why the UFC decided to give her a shot at the title. The UFC 292 co-main event is going to be her first fight for the title in this promotion.</p>
<p>This is also going to be the first time she’s fighting against such a well-rounded opponent as Weili. Lemos herself is a fantastic striker, but her wrestling/grappling skills aren’t elite. She did defeat Michele Waterson by submission last year, but “Karate Hottie” just isn’t as good on the floor as Weili.</p>
<p>Zhang Weili vs. Amanda Lemos Prediction</p>
<p>Zhang Weili is much better than Amanda Lemos in all aspects of mixed martial arts. She also probably has confidence on her side, given that she’s coming off two impressive wins. That’s why we expect her to get the job done before the end of the 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Pick: Zhang Weili to win</p>
