<p>ESA Gaming, an innovation-driven iGaming supplier and provider of games, has been integrated with Pariplay’s aggregation content platform, Fusion. The new partnership will allow both companies to benefit as Pariplay is committed to growing its library of titles and, ESA Gaming, on the other hand, is dedicated to consistently scaling its offering and reaching new audiences.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming Gets Distribution Leg-up with Pariplay</p>
<p>This is now possible for both brands through this tie-up. Thanks to this partnership, Fusion partner operators will have access to the EasySwipe portfolio developed by ESA Gaming, which is known for its lightweight overall architecture and a range of mobile-first games. Fusion partners will specifically have access to Goal Mine World Edition, Basketball Mine, Goal Mine, Fruitz &amp; Spinz and so many others.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming recently debuted a crash-style game, Rocket Racers, which will also be incorporated into the Fusion platform and be readily available to iGaming brands that want to offer it to their player bases. The EasySwipe benefits are clear and distinct as they offer sportsbooks the opportunity to cross-sell products without ever cannibalizing any of the existing channels.</p>
<p>This portfolio is associated with better overall lifetime value and non-traditional, high-quality games that are available by just swiping. ESA Gaming head of marketing Thomas Smallwood was excited about the new partnership and said:</p>
<p>Fusion gives us an exceptional reach for our strong range of content, and we’re delighted to be taking our offering live with a number of partners through the platform. ESA Gaming head of marketing Thomas Smallwood</p>
<p>Smallwood said that Pariplay’s focus on regulated markets and expanding in key jurisdictions will be particularly helpful for the supplier as well. Meanwhile, Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris was equally happy with the new opportunity the deal offered.</p>
<p>EasySwipe Adds True Value to Pariplay’s Fusion Platform</p>
<p>The EasySwipe addition is an important opportunity for Pariplay to service the needs of its customer bases, Harris confirmed. “Its titles have already proven to be incredibly popular across the globe, and we’re very happy to now be able to provide them to our partners,” he concluded.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming has been on a roll recently, launching with a number of prominent brands. In October, the brand rolled out its operations with 888AFRICA, and then, in November, the company’s games also arrived on Planetwin365 in Italy.</p>
