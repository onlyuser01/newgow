<p>Online casino game content supplier Pragmatic Play announced today a new agreement with Hollywoodbets that will expand its presence in the South African online casino market.</p>
<p>Premium Entertainment and Real Value Experiences</p>
<p>The partnership with premier sports betting operator Hollywoodbets will see Pragmatic Play’s entire portfolio of slot games available through the online casino offering of the tier-one sportsbook provider.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, Dermot O’Connell, Betting Operations Manager at Hollywoodbets, outlined the operator’s ongoing effort to offer its customers “premium entertainment” and “real value” experiences.</p>
<p>“With the support of Betting Entertainment Technologies, our betting software provider, this partnership will complement our existing product range, bringing our customers an array of new games.” Dermot O’Connell, Betting Operations Manager, Hollywoodbets</p>
<p>The catalog of game titles will include the recently released Barn Festival, as well as Pragmatic’s top-performing games such as Sweet Bonanza, John Hunter, Big Bass Bonanza and Wolf Gold and will further increase the lure of Hollywoodbets’ offering in South Africa.</p>
<p>“South Africa, while being well-established, still holds much opportunity for suppliers and partnering with its top operator simply refines that scope. Hollywoodbets is exactly the type of tier-one client we look to, in assisting us with our regional growth ambitions and we’re delighted to partner with them.” Yossi Barzely, Chief Business Development Officer, Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets customers will also have a comprehensive selection of engaging instant win games as Pragmatic Play will launch its complete array of scratch games under the partnership with the established online gaming operator in the country.</p>
<p>Providing a comprehensive portfolio of sports betting, slots, lucky number games, live casino and virtual sports, Hollywoodbets have been serving the South African market for years and affirmed itself as the leading betting and iGaming operator in the country.</p>
<p>South Africa is Key to Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>The agreement with Hollywoodbets is the second partnership for Pragmatic Play with a South African online gaming brand within a single month, following the deal with one of the country’s largest gaming and entertainment operators with over 20 years of experience, Goldrush.</p>
<p>In February, Pragmatic Play teamed with CDP Gaming Technologies in a B2B partnership to allow its brand Yesplay to resell Pragmatic Play products in South Africa.</p>
<p>Also in April, Pragmatic Play expanded its slot partnership with Romanian-based operator Superbet to include its Bingo products, and later on continued to grow its Romanian presence via a deal with Play Online Solutions and its brands Winner.ro, Elite Slots, and Seven.ro.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, Pragmatic Play also announced the much-anticipated launch of its sportsbook vertical.</p>
