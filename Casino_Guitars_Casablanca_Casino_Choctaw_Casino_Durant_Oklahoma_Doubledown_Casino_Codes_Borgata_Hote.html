<p>Customer relationship management (CRM) software supplier Optimove announced an agreement with bet365 that will see the retention specialist optimize CRM marketing activities for the largest online sports betting operator.</p>
<p>Add Third-Party Technology</p>
<p>The agreement between bet365 and Optimove is the latest display of the Stoke-on-Trent-based sports betting operator’s determination to scale marketing personalization and maximize player lifetime value as a growth driver.</p>
<p>Alex Sefton, chief marketing officer at bet365, focused on the company’s ongoing efforts to “build an industry-leading sports and gaming product,” outlining management’s belief that now is the perfect timing to boost the platform with “third party technology.”</p>
<p>“This deal heralds a change in direction for bet365, but also the start of a long-term partnership working with Optimove to grow our business,” he continued, noting that this is just the start of “something genuinely exciting” with the best partner in the field.</p>
<p>The partnership that marks the first-ever third-party CRM vendor deal for bet365 will leverage Optimove’s AI-based solution to transform bet365’s CRM marketing efforts by allowing the bookmaker to scale and manage hundreds of player segments, run real-time and scheduled multi-channel campaigns, and measure the incremental player from the interaction with each player.</p>
<p>‘True Super Team’</p>
<p>On behalf of Optimove, senior sales director Motti Colman labeled the agreement with bet365 “the proudest moment of his professional career, convinced that Optimove and bet365 make a “true super team.”</p>
<p>“As a company that is known for keeping most of its tech in-house, this is a huge move by bet365 to go out to a third-party provider,” Colman continued, feeling both proud and humbled by the operator’s belief in Optimove’s “ability to deliver,” and certain that both partners will accomplish huge things together to help propel bet365 to its next level of business growth.</p>
<p>Optimove’s AI-mapped CRM journeys will empower bet365 with enriched customer profiles that will feature all historical, predictive, and real-time customer data available across CRM, service clouds and data warehouses under a comprehensive single customer view.</p>
<p>The technology utilized by Optimove will also allow for multi-channel personalization and orchestration for hundreds of marketing campaigns to deliver personalized communication with each customer across any channel, as well as a continuous optimization loop by measuring the incremental value added by each campaign to constantly optimize the CRM performance.</p>
<p>Seeking to continuously expand its capabilities, Optimove recently acquired the cloud-based personalized platform focused on sports betting and iGaming, Graphyte, to add new tools to its portfolio of products tailored for the gambling industry.</p>
