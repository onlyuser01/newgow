    <h1>Mill Casino Coos Bay Four Jacks Hotel And Casino Slipper Casino Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Ramona</h1>

<p>Dear Cone2812,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>You must understand that asking for a bank statement is nothing unusual and it is often part of the verification process and we cannot penalize the casino for it. I can only recommend that you provide all the required documents in the requested format as soon as possible, otherwise, I am afraid you won't be able to withdraw your winnings.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
