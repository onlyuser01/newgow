<p>It’s time for the 2022 MLS Playoffs, and one of the most exciting matchups of Round 1 is New York City FC vs Inter Miami. The reigning MLS Cup champion – NYCFC – is seen as the favorite in Monday’s game, but we call for caution as the boys from Florida have been playing amazing soccer over the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>New York City FC’s First Step to Title Defense</p>
<p>New York City FC finished the regular season in the #3 position with 55 points in 34 games (16-7-11) record. Most of their points in 2022 MLS, the New Yorkers won at home (34 points), which is where they play against Inter Miami on Monday.</p>
<p>On their turf, NYCFC have played twice against Inter Miami so far, winning each time by the score of 2-0. Argentinean forward Valentin Castellanos was in the spotlight in both of those games, scoring two goals and recording one assist. Unfortunately for New York, Castellanos is no longer playing for this team.</p>
<p>Gabriel Pereira arrived in New York as Castellanos’ replacement, and so far, he’s been doing okay. He’s scored eight goals in the 2022 MLS, making four assists along the way.</p>
<p>This Could be Gonzalo Higuain’s Final Game</p>
<p>Legendary Argentinean striker Gonzalo Higuain has announced he’ll be retiring at the end of the season. That said, if his team loses to NYCFC on Monday, it could be his last game ever. But will Inter Miami lose?</p>
<p>We’re not so sure, considering that these guys have been playing amazing soccer lately. They did lose in the final round of the regular season, but it’s because they didn’t care about that match – they qualified for the playoffs a round earlier when they beat Orlando City.</p>
<p>The win over their interstate rivals was their fourth win in a row, as well as the fifth straight game in which Higuain got himself on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>New York City FC vs Inter Miami Prediction</p>
<p>Bookmakers think New York City FC will win this game, but we have to disagree. We think that Inter Miami’s roster is strong enough to win in New York. Experienced players like Higuain (but also Alejandro Pozuelo and Victor Ulloa) definitely have what it takes to surprise the oddsmakers.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Miami to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
