    <h1>List Of Sweepstakes Casinos Casino Resorts In Louisiana Online Real Cash Casinos Casino Extreme Logi</h1>

<p>In the end, you're always responsible, don't you think? 🙂</p>
<p>Alcohol is also poison for the body and yet it is sold on every corner and in the end you decide whether you get drunk to death every day.</p>
<p>Drugs are also forbidden, but you still have the opportunity to get them and you are responsible for them yourself.🙂</p>
<p>I find it a little nasty to point fingers and claim that others are to blame for the suffering you've been through. In the end it was you who made the decision and no one else.</p>
<p>Only you alone decided to lose a lot of money because you couldn't control yourself.</p>
<p>The Guru Team didn't put a gun to your head and forced you to play and lose your money 🙂</p>
<p>All the illegal sites will exist even if the Guru Team didn't exist. However, these sites would exist without people being able to control what they are dealing with there.</p>
<p>Casino Guru lists all casinos and then lets people decide for themselves.</p>
<p>For example, many casinos are flagged as not having a valid license or fake games and much much more!</p>
<p>Without the Guru team, many players would be playing in casinos that might be fraudulent and end up having problems in the form of winnings being confiscated or otherwise.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is, it's always easy to point the finger at others and blame them for your failures.</p>
<p>Without them you wouldn't know if the casino you want to play at is reputable or not, isn't that great? 🙂</p>
<p>I believe you lost a lot of money. Please believe me I'm sorry for this because I know this feeling well and it's always ugly to lose a lot of money, especially when you don't have much of it. But no one here is responsible for your losses as mean as that may sound 🙂</p>
<p>I wish you a nice day anyway and I hope that your losses are not too big 🙂</p>
