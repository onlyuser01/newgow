    <h1>Austin Casino Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Amphitheater St Louis Choctaw Casino Hotel Grand Casino O</h1>

<p>Just let it go... Who am I to pretend having been wronged ... Nothing can be helpful as you mentioned anyway ... So I'm sorry to have took your time my mistake my responsibility... I get that.. it's the response I was expecting...I hoped I could be listen too but rules does not take time to acknowledge the facts that my mistake was the result of how the bonus is presented... gonna deal with the feeling of being dismiss ... It's not important anyway ... to you I'll be the freeloader or the "victim" that cannot accept loosing ... Not someone who honestly could have avoid that with more care and transparency of the website ... in these time of financial hardship and despair an effort should be done to help those who are so stressed out and can't put attention to every little detail... I just wanted to have what I paid for ... Not even adjusting the bonus without changing anything so I could at least have the value of what I spent... It's so frustrating to have paid too much to receive the bonus... It's so ridiculous ... And not having access to any other bonus that I could have met requirements... Some have deposit only 20 buck receiving easily their bonus but because I started with a hundred it throw my bonus out of reach and this wasn't explain clearly at all not hinted ... It's not right to do so even if it's legitimate... But who care ... Haaaa I didn't ask to be proven victim ... I ask this to be made aware that it is a problem ... I just hoped the company would understand their choices is misleading a group of people and it's not okay to make money on their back and then wash their hands because they had written on small character on another page the true involvement of the first deposit and the consequences in the first action... It should be taken for account that people, many, are not aware of what they choose and no mistake is recognized as honest ... This is first everything bonus .. it's obvious people think they figure that out if some conditions are not clear ... And or bold ... How hard is it to put a mention close to the payment option or a reminder that you deposit 100 the wagering is strictly based on the first deposit and suggesting to deposit less if we know it not attainable... That would have change my choices ... The craziest is I would have spent the same amount ... It make no sense to not even at least extend the ridiculous 48h timeframe that put under pressure even more ... Fear of missing out technic really well used ... On that please let this case go and I'll pray that others will be better than I st figuring so many details mixed up purposefully...</p>
