    <h1>21 Casino Casino Newburgh Ny Vivaro Casino Ct Casino Casino South Bend Jackpocket Named Dallas Stars</h1>

<p>Jackpocket, the licensed third-party lottery app that provides a safe way of ordering official state lottery tickets while nurturing a fun, responsible, and convenient way of playing, has inked a three-year partnership with Dallas Stars. The National Hockey League team previously known as the Minnesota North State has agreed to appoint Jackpocket as its official digital lottery courier partner. What does the new deal mean for both parties? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Attractive Prizes for Sweepstake Winners in the 2022-23 Season</p>
<p>Scheduled to start running in the 2022-2023 hockey season, the new exclusive agreement represents a thrilling sports franchise partnership for Jackpocket, according to chief executive officer and founder Peter Sullivan. The team that plays in the Central Division of the Western Conference is also Texas’ only NHL representative in Texas, which makes the fresh partnership even more exciting. Sullivan explained that the company was looking forward to seeing its logo featured on the team’s scoreboard at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, which is its main headquarters.</p>
<p>New customers will have the chance to buy their first lottery ticket free of charge by using the promotional code “STARS“ during checkout. Jackpocket will also organize several sweepstakes during the upcoming hockey season. Fans of the team that has won three conference titles along with the prestigious Stanley Cup in 1999 can expect to be rewarded with important prizes. The list features access to behind-the-scenes activities, tickets to home games, flights to the team’s away games, and other similar perks. The team will also provide VIP experiences to the winners of the sweepstakes. Among them, access to Casino Night events, visits to the pre-game penalty box, autographed hockey gear belonging to the team, or the chance to take part in the Stars First Look during intermissions.</p>
<p>Elevating Game-day Experiences for Loyal Fans</p>
<p>Dallas Stars’ president and chief executive officer Brad Alberts described Jackpocket as their new “trusted partner” that would help them elevate their game-day experiences for their most loyal fans. Alberts added the team was looking forward to bringing Jackpocket’s digital lottery courier app “excitement and convenience” to its “great fans.“ Jackpocket was ranked as the number one free app in the App Store during July’s historic draw connected to Mega Millions. It was also included in the top 10 during the historic Powerball drawing that took place in November. In mid-October, Jackpocket announced it would expand into the 13th US state through its Idaho launch. In August, the same lottery app company became ESPN NY’s exclusive sponsor.</p>
