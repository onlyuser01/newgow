    <h1>Casino Hollywood Biloxi Casino In Mississippi Warroad Casino The M Casino Vegas Casino Extreme Bonus</h1>

<p>State-owned Loto-Quebec announced yesterday it would be temporarily suspending several of its gaming facilities, in line with new Quebec Government-issued restrictions related to the rise in the new cases of the coronavirus disease. Activities in the Monteregie, Centre-du-Quebec and Capitale-Nationale regions, including Charlevoix will be affected.</p>
<p>The state-run body set up in 1969 with the aim to oversee games of chance in Quebec, will be closing Casino de Charlevoix starting Friday, October 16. The casino has been working on a four-day-per-week schedule, from Thursday to Sunday, since July.</p>
<p>A Series of Temporary Closures</p>
<p>The gaming establishment in Charlevoix is the latest to be affected by the coronavirus-related restrictions, as Loto-Quebec began suspending some of its activities on Friday, October 9, when it suspended operations in Trois-Rivières, part of Centre-du-Québec and the Portneuf RMC.</p>
<p>Effective Saturday, the gaming body closed the Trois-Rivieres gaming hall, ceased operations for video lottery terminals (VLTs) in Trois-Rivières, Centre-du-Québec (Bécancour, Nicolet-Yamaska and Drummond RMCs) and Portneuf RMC, and closed the Kinzo hall in Drummondville. On top of that, Loto-Quebec suspended network bingo activities even in halls which remained open.</p>
<p>Further gaming establishments were affected Saturday, October 10, when Loto-Quebec extended suspensions to include activities in Gatineau and the regional county municipality of Collines-de-l’Outaouais, where it suspended VLTs, starting from Sunday. In addition, the operator closed Casino du Lac-Leamy and its restaurants, while the Hilton Lac-Leamy Hotel was shut down on Monday.</p>
<p>The latest round of shut downs will also affect Loto-Quebec’s VLTs in the Monteregie, Centre-du-Quebec and Capitale-Nationale regions, as well as Kinzo halls, even in regions that are not on red alert. Currently, only one Kinzo establishment is in a red zone.</p>
<p>List of Suspended Activities</p>
<p>Presently, the Casino de Montréal, Casino du Lac-Leamy, Salon de jeux de Québec, Salon de jeux de Trois-Rivières, Hilton Lac-Leamy Hotel, and VLTs in Greater Montréal, Chaudière-Appalaches, Capitale-Nationale, Mauricie, City of Gatineau and regional county municipality of Collines-de-l’Outaouais are all temporarily closed, Loto-Quebec outlined, noting it will be further suspending its network bingo.</p>
<p>Loto-Quebec pointed out lottery sales not impacted by the new virus-related restrictions would continue at all retail outlets. In addition, the Casino de Mont-Tremblant and VLTs in all other Quebec regions remain operational.</p>
<p>Public health and safety remains a priority and the temporary measures are necessary to protect customers and employees alike, Loto-Quebec stated, urging people to be cautious and follow prescribed guidelines, and when possible, limit their travel between regions.</p>
