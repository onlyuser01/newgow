    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Concerts Grand Falls Casino Wild Wild West Casino Las Vegas Harrah S Cherokee Hotel</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I deposited 50 euros and got a 50 euros bonus = 100 euros. Before I started playing, I asked in live chat whether I could play live casino. I was told that 50 Euro real money will be used first and that I can live casino. In the livecasino I won immediately and wanted to pay out. Unfortunately, that wasn't possible due to the wagering requirements. With a 50 euro deposit I had to turn over 3750 â‚¬, which seemed completely impossible to me. After 4 days of slots I did 100% and was able to pay out 600 euros. After 3 working days the payment was gone and only 70 euros remained in my account.</p>
<p>I asked in the live chat and I was told I played over 5 euros so all winnings are gone.</p>
<p>I have never played slots in my life at 5 euros or over 5 euros. Live casino yes but I asked beforehand and that was no problem with real money.</p>
<p>I NEVER played with bonus money because I immediately won with real money.</p>
<p>I said that I need the money and my account was blocked due to suspected gaming problems.</p>
<p>I played at max 1 euro slots and did nothing wrong and still everything went away. Please help me I feel powerless.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours</p>
<p>Halima</p>
