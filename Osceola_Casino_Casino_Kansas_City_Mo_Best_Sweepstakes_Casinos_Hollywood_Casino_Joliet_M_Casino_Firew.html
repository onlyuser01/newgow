<p>Soft2Bet Unleashes a Zombie Apocalypse on iGaming</p>
<p>Gaming tech company and provider of sportsbook solutions Soft2Bet has revealed a new casino brand dedicated to zombies. In Casombie, players will get to experience a properly-themed undead casino where pop culture myths, legends, and expectations come together in a delightful, rotting mash-up.</p>
<p>The casino features products from leading third-party gaming suppliers and while not every game is focused on zombies, there is a good deal of themed games to choose from.
