<p>The launch of SportsGrid Canada is seen by the company as an important step in bridging publishers with young adult audiences</p>
<p>SportsGrid, a streaming network providing coverage on fantasy sports and sports betting, announced today the upcoming launch of its new Canadian FAST channel that will make its debut on SportsGrid Network next year.</p>
<p>Expanding into Canada</p>
<p>The new channel, SportsGrid Canada, will debut in mid-February via SportsGrid Network, bringing real-time data and exclusive, live sports wagering content to Canadian viewers on Connected TVs and devices, covering all major collegiate and professional sports in North America.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Jason Sukhraj, general manager of Syndication, outlined the upcoming launch of the new sports wagering content channel as “an important day” for the company, in line with its goals to expand “overall global streaming ecosystem and regional coverage of sports wagering.”</p>
<p>“SportsGrid Canada will be a differentiated streaming program service providing daily sports betting coverage of Canadian sports with insightful commentary and real-time data visualizations,” Sukhraj continued.</p>
<p>“Canada is an important market for SportsGrid,” he added, explaining that it creates opportunities for advertisers to connect with young people aged between 18 and 34 who are shifting their preferences to seek sports wagering data and insights from streaming platforms.</p>
<p>Strategic Content Media Alliances</p>
<p>To enhance the level of its upcoming Canadian program service, SportsGrid announced it would be seeking to enter into strategic content alliances with media companies covering Canadian sports leagues, conferences and clubs over television nationwide.</p>
<p>The SportsGrid network comprising SportsGrid Steaming Network, SportsGrid Radio, SportsGrid.com, DailyRoto, and SportsGrid Studios, launched a video distribution platform in 2020, seeking to become the go-to destination for sports gaming audiences by providing them with unrivaled programming, data, technology, and gaming analysis.</p>
<p>By syndicating its video distribution channel programming to premium publishers such as The Associated Press (AP), SportsGrid is aiming to help these publishers engage with their audiences in a meaningful way and grow their customer base.</p>
<p>The coverage agreement signed with AP in October allowed access to SportsGrid’s content, including pre-game odds, over/under, money lines, point spreads, as well as advanced data analytics for all AP customers via the AP Video Hub and Newsroom platforms.</p>
<p>Also in October, SportsGrid announced an agreement with VIDAA to provide the platform with 18 hours of exclusive live content that is designed to appeal to diehard sports and sports betting fans and is featuring a myriad of on-air personalities, sports betting analysts and guest contributors. The deal expanded SportsGrid’s footprint to VIDAA’s over 300 global and local channels across more than 160 countries.</p>
