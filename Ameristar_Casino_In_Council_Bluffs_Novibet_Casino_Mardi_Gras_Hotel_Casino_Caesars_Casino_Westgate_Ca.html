<p>Ibex.ai, an artificial intelligence expert, has decided to provide iGaming operators with a free trial of its next-gen CRM services as a way to prove that its solutions are the best on the market. This system is set to provide massive assistance to start-ups who don’t have the budget for their own CRM software, as well as brands that are considering entering new markets.</p>
<p>The Tool Will Help Small Teams Rise Quickly</p>
<p>Thomas Aigner, Ibex.ai, head of business development, shared a few words on the CRM tool. He stated that new technologies allow brands to revolutionize their optimization strategies. He added that Ibex.Ai is “at the cutting edge of this innovation” and that he’s confident that the company can offer the highest level of personalization and automation.</p>
<p>Aigner ended by saying that everyone at Ibex.ai is excited to deliver the powerful product to as many operators as possible and thus continue building on its success.</p>
<p>Ibex.ai’s self-driving system has changed the way retention works as it introduced higher personalization and automation levels to campaigns that are player-focused. The brand reached its initial success with reputable online casino operators such as Grand Ivy Casinos, Casimba and Dream Vegas. Now, many more operators are given the chance to use Ibex.Ai next-gen CRM services for three months without any payments.</p>
<p>The deep-learning algorithms by Ibex.ai allow the company to judge each player individually, without the need to segment them. AI targets players in the best moment and in doing so, the personalization method increases profitability.</p>
<p>As a result, the automated communication and campaigns result in lower costs for online casino operators as well as an increase in player retention rate.</p>
<p>Casino Brands Are Open to Partnering With Companies That Offer CRM Services</p>
<p>A recent survey conducted by Enteractive revealed that improper CRM strategies can affect player retention. That is why numerous casino brands are more than open to partnering with companies that offer exclusive CRM services.</p>
<p>Recently, online casino operator Las Vegas Casino Diamond decided to enhance its CRM strategy by partnering with Symplify, a reputable company offering CRM and AI cloud solutions. Thanks to this partnership, LVC Diamond’s standout brands will be able to build momentum and improve customer engagement.</p>
<p>Vegas.hu and Vipcasino.hu are LVC Diamond’s standout brands and they are especially popular in the Hungarian market. Robert Kimber, the CEO of Symplify, acknowledged the reputation of these two brands and added that Symplify is eager to bring its CRM prowess and thus, allow players to get the most “from their gaming experiences.”</p>
