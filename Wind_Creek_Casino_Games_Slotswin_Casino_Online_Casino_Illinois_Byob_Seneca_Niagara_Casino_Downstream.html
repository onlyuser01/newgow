    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Games Slotswin Casino Online Casino Illinois Byob Seneca Niagara Casino Downstream</h1>

<p>I have been playing with the brango group for about a year now, and have never met a problem which couldn't be handled -either through checking t&amp;cs or through perseverance (or both). Until Friday July 14.</p>
<p>I accepted a bonus on Limitless and met the wagering requirements pretty quickly, ending with nearly $200. As the bonuses are sticky, and i had deposited $32 , I decided to keep playing bc $32 was all i could withdraw at the time. Without doing so, I was logged out. It happens sometimes, so I simply logged back in.</p>
<p>My balance was zero. Expecting to be told I had accidentally violated the t&amp;cs, I contacted support, and to my surprise, was informed 'I hadn't deposited '. Asking for a supervisor, I was told no and abruptly disconnected from chat.</p>
<p>Its pretty well known chat support with the brango group -save for a few wonderful souls - is pretty cruddy, so, concerned ,I tried again, this time requesting a tech.</p>
<p>Again told no, again disconnected. Being stubborn, I tried again, and it didn't go well, Im afraid I was pretty insulting towards the end. Trying a different tact, I contacted brango chat support, while she was sympathetic, again she informed me no tech or supervisor was available. I contacted brango via email the next Monday and was told 'Limitless is not part of thier group.'.</p>
<p>Nearly defeated, I contacted limitless support via email. It has now been a week, and crickets. Please help, I will settle for my original $32 returned.</p>
