<p>Busing on the Lookout’s director, Annie Sovcik, has called for casino training programs in which staff will be able to recognize potential human trafficking. While addressing Las Vegas’ World Game Protection Conference, Sovcik noted that casinos are one of the prime destinations for sex trafficking.</p>
<p>400 Children Are Taken into Prostitution in Las Vegas Each Year</p>
<p>According to Las Vegas Metro Police, around 400 kids are taken from the streets of Las Vegas each year and are pushed into prostitution. Moreover, Las Vegas is among the 17 top destinations for human trafficking in the US, as reported by the US Justice Department.</p>
<p>Sovcik thinks that instead of the casinos being places where people are trafficked, they can actually act as refugee sites. She stated that even though many people want to make a difference, they are not in the position to do so. However, gaming industry leaders definitely have the power to make a change in this dark issue.</p>
<p>At the conference, Sovcik showed the audience videos of people that were trafficked in both Las Vegas and Atlantic City. All of these people admitted to being beaten for not being able to meet a certain money quota. She even read a statement by Annika Huff and a former victim of this crime.</p>
<p>Huff described how everyone knew who she was in that statement, but nobody asked any questions. She also added that if someone stopped for a second to talk to her, they may have been able to see what was happening and possibly, save her.</p>
<p>Casino Floors Are Monitored Every Second</p>
<p>In the light of the recent sex-trafficking scandal involving a Las Vegas Fire Department employee, Sovcik states that casino floors are one of the most monitored places. That security could be used to save victims of these crimes, instead of them being hidden in plain sight.</p>
<p>She noted that many casinos are already stepping up to make a difference and Sovcik stated that casinos have protocols in place to contact the police if signs of human trafficking are spotted. Additionally, Sovcik said that there is a way to recognize whether some people are part of this illegal industry.</p>
<p>According to her, every person should pay extra attention to people who do not make any eye contact and seem like they are controlled by someone else. A few questions can go a long way, she says. Sovcik’s group has casino training materials, including guidelines on how to safely contact law enforcement, a 24-minute webinar, as well as a toolkit for those that want to launch anti-trafficking initiatives.</p>
<p>As for the reason why casinos are such a popular destination, Sovcik states that these facilities attract people who are willing to spend money and take risks. Traffickers are well-aware of this fact, which is why they are constantly operating here.</p>
