    <h1>L Auberge Hotel Casino Lake Charles Cosmopolitan Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Island Casino And Resort</h1>

<p>A New York citizen has accused the company of repeatedly providing him with cash bonuses to encourage him to continue gambling</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International is refuting allegations made by Sam Antar, a New York City man who claims that MGM took advantage of his gambling addiction. MGM argues that Antar is a convicted fraudster who has victimized multiple individuals in the past and is now attempting to falsely accuse the company.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts Files Response and Seeks Dismissal in Lawsuit by Fraudster Sam Antar</p>
<p>In its response filed on June 9 in US District Court in New Jersey, MGM stated that Antar, who has been jailed twice for fraud, is engaging in another scheme by blaming the company for his actions. MGM has requested the dismissal of Antar‘s lawsuit and the referral of the matter to arbitration, as agreed upon in the terms of service when Antar opened his online gambling account.</p>
<p>Antar, the nephew of Eddie Antar, the founder of the defunct Crazy Eddie electronics stores, has a history of fraudulent activities. He was sentenced to federal prison in 2013 for running a fraudulent investment scheme, and in 2022, he was convicted and jailed for theft by deception charges. In addition, Antar recently admitted to committing federal securities fraud and has been ordered to pay restitution.</p>
<p>MGM’s court filing emphasized Antar’s criminal background and argued that the company did not create or exacerbate Antar’s gambling problem. While Antar initially accused MGM of discouraging him from reporting disconnections during winning streaks in his online gambling sessions, his revised lawsuit focuses on the alleged enticement of a problem gambler by the casino.</p>
<p>New Jersey Law Doesn’t Obligate Casinos to Prevent Compulsive Gambling, Says MGM</p>
<p>MGM emphasized that it takes problem gambling seriously and offers options for self-exclusion and play limits, as well as resources for assistance. The company also cited New Jersey law, which does not impose a duty on casinos to prevent compulsive gamblers from engaging in gambling activities.</p>
<p>Antar’s revised lawsuit shares similarities with a previous case involving another individual who sued Atlantic City casinos in 2008, claiming that they had a duty to stop her from gambling. The judge ruled against the plaintiff, stating that the casinos’ profit from her misfortune did not establish a legal claim.</p>
<p>MGM’s response to Antar’s litigation includes various defenses, citing the earlier case as well as Antar’s criminal history. The company urges the court to dismiss the lawsuit and highlights its belief that the allegations are baseless and far-fetched. As the legal battle unfolds, the outcome will determine whether MGM will face any consequences for its alleged actions or if the court will side with the company’s arguments against Antar’s claims.</p>
