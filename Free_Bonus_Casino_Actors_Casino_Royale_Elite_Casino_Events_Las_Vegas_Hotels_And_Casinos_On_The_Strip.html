<p>SkillOnNet has added a new partner to its content platform, with Playson becoming the latest contributor to the library of games. As a result, the Maltese-headquartered developer will inject more than 85 games that are available on both mobile and desktop into SkillOnNet’s purpose-built solution, which will benefit its own casino brands.</p>
<p>Among those titles are Pirate Sharky, Royal Coins: Hold and Win, and Treasures of Fire: Scatter Pays. Pariplay is licensed in the majority of European jurisdictions making for a trusted and worthwhile addition to the SkillOnNet platform.</p>
<p>Playson already has an established track record in the iGaming industry, having launched in 20 countries and working with more than 140 partners around the globe. The addition to the SkillOnNet platform will certainly give the developer a further boost. Playson has managed to enter Ontario, Canada earlier this year, marking an important milestone in the company’s growth history.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new partnership, SkillOnNet Head of Games Jani Kontturi said that the company was very happy to have secured content by Playson, which will offer further help to the content distribution capabilities of the company.</p>
<p>Kontturi praised the gameplay and visuals featured in Playson games and said: "It’s a really diverse portfolio of exciting titles, developed with engaging math and wrapped in beautiful aesthetics."</p>
<p>Playson Sales Director Blanka Homor was similarly pleased with this new opportunity and said that the partnership was an opportunity to keep adding to Playson’s growth momentum and contribute to a portfolio of impressive games. SkillOnNet makes a great partner, too, as the company is operating some of the world’s most established casino brands, to name PlayOjo and LuckyNiki.</p>
<p>The platform already features more than 3,500 titles that run across a number of categories in the iGaming industry, to name live dealer, bingo, instant win, video slots, progressive slots, table games, classic slots, and others. SkillOnNet has also been keen to attract more trusted and respected developers, especially those that have been capable of delivering groundbreaking products.</p>
<p>In September, the company announced a partnership with Hölle Games, a supplier operating out of Germany focusing on the local market and exporting what it describes as the "German touch" to other iGaming markets through SkillOnNet and other partners.</p>
