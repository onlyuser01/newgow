    <h1>Rio Hotel And Casino Reviews Casino In Council Bluffs Iowa Casinos Near Syracuse Ny Casino Names Pen</h1>

<p>I reopened my account a few days ago and deposited 100 euros, earned 200 and withdrawn them and they paid me for a visa the same day. The next day I returned to deposit 200 and earn 700, now having a balance of 900 euros. I made a withdrawal on the 27th but they return the money to the casino balance because they ask me for documents.</p>
<p>Once I have been able to verify documents they send me an email telling me to send the cards with which I deposited several months ago (February and March) and it turns out that I ask for the number of those cards but they do not answer anything.</p>
<p>My cards from several months ago are canceled and destroyed and I only have one card ending in 4420 which is the one I currently use.</p>
<p>Well, it seems that they do not enter into reasons and they do not answer me or give me any solution and I have already told them that those cards no longer exist.</p>
<p>Also they collected all those deposits from several months ago</p>
<p>(February and March) and I do not know what comes now to demand that I send you a photo of those cards, I repeat, they no longer exist.</p>
<p>The withdrawal money is sent back to my account balance at the casino and we are never done with this.</p>
