<p>Fruit Warp review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Without winlines you can win with up to 3 sets of fruits</p>
<p>Fruit Warp’s not your average slot. It does away entirely with the whole reel or grid structure, it has no cutesy characters or complex bonus games.</p>
<p>Instead, it features an eerie, but strangely beautiful void from which 9 pieces of fruit emerge as if flung out by the eldritch greengrocer of the abyss.</p>
<p>What bizarre mind constructed this, we don’t know. But it is hard not to fall immediately for its simple and elegant mechanics and visuals.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game is 3D modelled in a way that allows the fruit to come arcing up at you in a lazy parabola. Once they arrive in front of you they spin slowly in place until warped out of existence by the next spin.</p>
<p>The sound design is basic, with a slightly annoying marimba track you might want to mute if you’ll be playing for a while.</p>
<p>But in all other ways, the game takes full advantage of the Thunderkick slot software.</p>
<p>Even simple spin looks different in this game without reels</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>As described above the gameplay the game throws a random selection of nine fruits at you rather than dealing with reels and symbols on a grid.</p>
<p>If you hit three or more of the same fruit the game pays out.</p>
<p>Explanation how bonus works</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>If you manage to hit four of the same kind of fruit a portal zaps the other fruit out of existence and triggers a respin of those fruit.</p>
<p>Hit five or more and you trigger one of the fruit mode bonuses. Each fruit mode is a slightly different set of bonuses and multipliers that are triggered when you hit more of the same kind of specific fruit. The game continues until a spin happens without the fruit mode’s specific fruit appearing.</p>
<p>If you hit 4 of the same fruits you get the respin feature which gives you big chance for a Fruit game</p>
<p>In each fruit mode every time you hit one of the mode’s fruit you earn a combination of lives, which allow you to ignore a spin where there are none of the specific fruit, and multipliers which are applied to your total win at the end of the bonus feature.</p>
<p>Each type of fruit provides a different combination of lives and multipliers with the rarest fruit giving the best rewards during bonuses.</p>
<p>Hitting the special symbol of a bonus game raises the multiplier for your bonus winnings</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>As well as its visual appeal the game has a relatively low vig of 3% which is attractive enough and goes well with the medium-level volatility of the game.</p>
<p>The range of bets is not bad £/$/€0.10 to £/$/€100 per spin. Obviously, without win lines, there is no way to manipulate volatility nor to affect bet size more subtly than by simply changing the coin size.</p>
<p>Low symbols paytable</p>
<p>Mid symbols paytable</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>For anyone looking for a medium volatility slot, this can be strongly recommended with its decent RTP (97.0%) and innovative style and gameplay. This slot is great fun.</p>
