<p>The content and commercial partnership with PUNCH marked Better Collective's first step in Africa</p>
<p>Sports betting media group Better Collective announced today it has entered into a content and commercial media partnership with a prominent digital media publisher in Nigeria, PUNCH Nigeria Limited.</p>
<p>A Continent of Sports Betting Enthusiasts</p>
<p>The new content partnership Better Collective signed with PUNCH represents the group’s first step in Africa where the population of sports betting enthusiasts is continually growing, and presenting new growth opportunities for the group.</p>
<p>Commenting on the important development, Jesper Søgaard, co-founder and chief executive officer of Better Collective, said how proud everyone at the group feels to partner with “a well-established news media like PUNCH.”</p>
<p>Not only will we be partnering with Nigeria’s market leader but this partnership also allows us to establish a presence on the African continent. Jesper Søgaard, co-founder &amp; CEO, Better Collective</p>
<p>As Nigeria’s leading news media group, PUNCH publishes and distributes media content via websites, videos, podcasts and social media channels, and the partnership allows Better Collective to run a sports betting section on PUNCH’s digital platform and Punchng.com, the country’s number one website.</p>
<p>Managing director and editor-in-chief of PUNCH, Adeyeye Joseph, also commented on the agreement, expressing his excitement at the opportunity to partner with a sports media business such as Better Collective.</p>
<p>“We are excited to work with a passionate technology-driven partner like Better Collective,” he said, hoping that the collaboration “will help PUNCH to serve Nigeria’s growing sports betting community with high-quality content while also helping [the] company to further its audience and revenue goals.”</p>
<p>Running a Sports Betting Section on PUNCH</p>
<p>Throughout the contract, Better Collective will leverage its innovative technology and expertise in content creation to run a commercial sports betting section with high-quality English content for PUNCH readers.</p>
<p>Better Collective’s section on PUNCH is expected to help the Nigerian media’s readers to make informed decisions and navigate the different aspects of the rapidly growing world of digital sports entertainment.</p>
<p>Seeking to inform, educate and entertain via the content it creates, PUNCH, one of the oldest and most respected news sources in the country, aligns with the values and mission of Better Collective to educate sports fans and make the sports entertainment industry more engaging and fun.</p>
<p>The agreement with PUNCH is the first agreement of the sports betting media group in Africa. While serving primarily the Nigerian market, PUNCH’s presence extends to other parts of Africa and audiences in Europe, North America and Asia.</p>
<p>Last month, Better Collective released its interim Q4 2022 report posting growth in revenue and EBITDA of 63% and 115%, respectively, year-over-year.</p>
