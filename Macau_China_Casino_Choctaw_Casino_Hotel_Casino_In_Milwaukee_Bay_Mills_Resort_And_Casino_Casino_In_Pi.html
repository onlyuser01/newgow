    <h1>Macau China Casino Choctaw Casino Hotel Casino In Milwaukee Bay Mills Resort And Casino Casino In Pi</h1>

<p>Dear Locbond123456,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the General T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"13.4. Self-Exclusion and Cool off</p>
<p>13.4.1. You may choose to completely exclude yourself from playing any of the Games on our Site. To do so you must login and goto the Self Exclusion page. For residents outside Great Britain or Northern Ireland, you stipulate the period for which you wish to be self-excluded and your account will automatically be reactivated thereafter.</p>
<p>13.4.2. You will not be able to open any account with the Site should you opt for self-exclusion. You will also forfeit any entry into any competition or draw which was entered into prior to such self-exclusion as well as forfeiting any non-cash prizes or invitations which have been granted to you or offered to you prior to such self-exclusion but which have not yet been redeemed or utilised by you (for example, where tickets for an event have been offered but the event is to take place during a self-exclusion period, the invitation is automatically withdrawn upon self- exclusion). Lastly, you will not be receiving any marketing campaigns or personal messages from us until your self-exclusion period expires. This is to prevent gambling being promoted to you in a time where you have taken some time to assess your gambling behaviour."</p>
<p>Could you please forward me the self-exclusion requests that you sent to the casino? Do you still have access to your account?</p>
<p>Also, if there is any relevant communication between you and the casino, please forward it to kristina.s@casino.guru together with your self-exclusion request.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
