<p>Craig Carton, the one-time New York sports radio host who was convicted on federal fraud charges, returned to broadcasting this week when a documentary about his story, including his issues with problem gaming, premiered on HBO. And that may not be the last we see or hear from him.</p>

<p>The New York Post reported last week WFAN radio has talked with him about coming back to his old station.</p>
<p>Carton and former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason anchored the FAN’s popular morning-drive show for years. Three years ago, the station removed Carton from the show after federal agents arrested him for wire and securities fraud.</p>
<p>In 2018, a jury convicted him of taking $5.6 million from investors for a ticket reselling business and spending the money in other ways. That included fueling a gambling habit, which included numerous trips to casinos in Atlantic City and elsewhere.</p>
<p>A judge sentenced Carton to 42 months in prison last year. However, he served only about a year of that sentence before authorities released him in June. He’s currently serving home incarceration.</p>
<p>Blackjack Busts Carton</p>
<p>The documentary, Wild Card: The Downfall of a Radio Loudmouth, goes into detail about gambling’s prevalence in Carton’s life.</p>
<p>It includes a boast he made to Esiason during the show where Carton said he could take $10,000 of his partner’s money gambling and turn it into $25,000.</p>
<p>He ended up being wrong. He turned it into $80,000.</p>
<p>The real problem with the Boomer bet is that I won,” Carton says in the documentary. “As a result of that win, I’m now ‘The Blackjack Whisperer.’”</p>
<p>Carton said he started fielding inquiries from others offering six-figure sums or more. In all, Carton said he borrowed more than $30 million to fuel his habit that went on as he maintained his presence as a top radio and sports personality in America’s top media market.</p>
<p>Besides Carton, the documentary includes interviews with others who worked with, knew, or covered him. That includes his former broadcast partner Esiason and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.</p>
<p>“Craig gave us unprecedented access to his world as it was crumbling around him,” said Marie McGovern, who produced Wild Card with Martin Dunn. “We see Craig in real-time as he weathers public scrutiny and endures private pain. The emotion is real and raw.”</p>
<p>Still in Court</p>
<p>While Carton is out of prison, he’s not out of the court system just yet.</p>
<p>Besides the prison time, US District Judge Colleen McMahon also ordered Carton to pay more than $4.8 million in restitution to his victims.</p>
<p>In August, Carton filed for Chapter 7 protection in US Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey.</p>
<p>In his filing, Carton claimed assets valued at more than $981,000, while having liabilities totaling more $9.4 million. The restitution he must pay to his victims from the fraud case makes up more than half of that total.</p>
<p>In addition, his bankruptcy claim also lists the SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia, now known as Rivers Casino Philadelphia, as an unsecured creditor that is owed $385,000.</p>
