<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a leading supplier of online casino games, has signed a new content agreement with NetBet Italy. Under the agreement, many of the provider’s best games will be integrated into the operator’s offering.</p>
<p>As a result of the deal, players in Italy will be able to try out many of Hacksaw’s cutting-edge titles, including the flagship hit Wanted Dead or a Wild. In addition to that, players will also get to experience games such as Hand of Anubis, Gladiator Legends and Tosh Video Club, among others.</p>
<p>The deal also covers gaming content from Hacksaw’s Dare2Win suite, including Mines, Coins and Boxes.</p>
<p>As agreed, Hacksaw Gaming will inject more games into NetBet Italy at a later date, helping the operator solidify its position in the local market.</p>
<p>NetBet Italy is notably Hacksaw Gaming’s eleventh casino partner in the country. The studio received full regulatory approval earlier this year and has been bullish on expanding its presence in the European country.</p>
<p>In addition to the multiple launches in Italy, Hacksaw Gaming recently made a foray into Bulgaria, supplying Inbet with games. The company further expanded its presence in the Balkans in August when it inked a deal with N1 Casinos in Greece.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Hacksaw continues to push on the NA front, having recently signed a West Virginia-facing deal with DraftKings.</p>
<p>Hacksaw’s Games Align with NetBet’s Ambition</p>
<p>The partnership between Hacksaw and NetBet was welcomed by the two companies. Representatives praised the deal with Marcus Cordes, Hacksaw Gaming’s chief executive officer, saying that the deal demonstrates his team’s commitment to expanding its business in key regulated markets. He noted that Italy, “which continues to grow at lightspeed,” is a very important market for Hacksaw.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we’re constantly looking to team up with industry players of the highest pedigree. Netbet.IT is yet another household name that needs no introduction – an operator that shares our passion for excellence and delivering market-leading products and services. Marcus Cordes, CEO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>NetBet Italy’s PR manager, Claudia Georgevici, also commented on the new partnership, praising Hacksaw Gaming’s excellent portfolio. She said that the company’s outstanding games align with NetBet’s goal to provide players with unparalleled gaming experiences.</p>
<p>Their commitment to excellence and their portfolio of exciting games perfectly aligns with our goal of providing our players with the best entertainment environment. Claudia Georgevici, PR manager, NetBet Italy</p>
<p>Georgevici’s words are reflected in the multiple recent agreements between the operator and leading casino content providers, such as BGaming, R. Franco and Spinomenal.</p>
