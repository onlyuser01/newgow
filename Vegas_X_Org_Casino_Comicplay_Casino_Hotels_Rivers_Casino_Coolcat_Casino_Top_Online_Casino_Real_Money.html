<p>Evoplay invited players to participate in an exciting journey to the Stone Age</p>
<p>Evoplay, an award-winning developer of casino content, has unleashed a new mobile game called Northern Temple. Players will travel to a picturesque green landscape filled with mythical creatures as they fire the reels of the studio’s latest slot.</p>

<p>Embark on a Stone-Age Adventure</p>
<p>Northern Temple is a 5×3 game where players will collect symbols representing ancient monolithic statues. Players can also land on Golden Wilds which serve as a substitute for all other regular symbols. These will only appear from the second reel onward, however.</p>
<p>Once players score a win, the winning symbols will disappear and a new row will appear above the grid. New symbols will then fill in the emptied spaces, allowing players to score additional wins during the same spin. The mechanic can temporarily turn the game into a 5×6 slot.</p>
<p>The growing reel feature can also trigger multipliers, increasing the money players win with their bets. Collecting three or more Coin symbols would reveal multipliers that allow players to win up to 6,000 the bet.</p>
<p>If players collect three or more Scatter symbols (represented by a golden tree) they will trigger the bonus round. In Free Spins mode, players will have 15 free spins, allowing them to win huge prizes. Lucky players can land on Coin symbols and earn additional free spins.</p>
<p>The launch of Northern Temple follows the release of other hit titles, such as Penalty Roulette and Goddess of the Night Bonus Buy.</p>
<p>CEO Kravchuk Is Excited about the Release</p>
<p>Ivan Kravchuk, Evoplay’s chief executive officer, invited players to participate in an exciting journey to the Stone Age and collect mystical symbols to win massive wins. He added that the game’s multiple engagement features are sure to keep players on the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>Stacked with features including growing reels, multiplier coins and the thrilling Free Spins round, Northern Temple is a highly engaging title with a multitude of ways to be awarded to keep players enticed. Ivan Kravchuk, CEO, Evoplay</p>
