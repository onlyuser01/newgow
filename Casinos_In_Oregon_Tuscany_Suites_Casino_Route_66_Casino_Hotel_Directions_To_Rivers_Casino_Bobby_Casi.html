<p>Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder Part III in Macau? Boxing Promoters Campaigning for Far-East Showdown</p>

<p>While boxing is immensely popular in Asia, Macau hasn’t hosted a major bout since 2014, when Manny Pacquiao beat Chris Algieri. But with the coronavirus keeping sports in the United States in jeopardy for the foreseeable future, and fans unlikely to be permitted to pack stadiums anytime soon, boxing promoters in China believe the odds they can land such a title fight are strong.</p>
<p>Fury, aka “The Gypsy King,” is the current WBC Heavyweight world champion. He’s held the title since defeating Fury, aka “The Bronze Bomber,” in February at the MGM Garden Arena in Las Vegas. It was a rematch of their controversial split decision draw in December of 2018.</p>
<p>Their February fight, however, included a provision in the contract that allows the loser to invoke a trilogy fight. If Fury opts not to fight Wilder for a third time, he’ll need to pay several million dollars to his challenger.</p>
<p>I’m not paying him no money to step aside,” Fury said recently on Instagram. “I’d rather take his scalp again.”</p>
<p>As for a rematch, Fury is the favorite, William Hill listing him at 2/7 (implied odds 77.78 percent). A $100 winning bet would net just $28.57. Wilder is the underdog at 11/4 (26.67 percent odds).</p>
<p>Major in Macau</p>
<p>Macau, one of two Special Administrative Regions (SAR) in China – the other being Hong Kong – has responded well to the COVID-19 pandemic. The enclave has just 45 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and zero deaths.</p>
<p>The casino destination has largely kept its borders closed to all foreigners during the health crisis, the current three exceptions being travelers arriving from mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. But even people coming from those three areas are required to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine.</p>
<p>The strict response could allow the enclave to be back open to near pre-coronavirus levels later this summer or fall. Fury’s promoter Frank Warren confirmed to UK’s Daily Star that he is undergoing negotiations with a “Far East territory” to hold Fury-Wilder III.</p>
<p>Fan Appetite</p>
<p>Fury notoriously licked Wilder’s bloody neck during their February clash. The fight was well-received by fans, and boxing analysts praised Fury’s performance, which ended in a TKO of Wilder – the first time he’s ever been subjected to a technical knockout.</p>
<p>Some fans, however, would rather see Fury move on and fight fellow Brit Anthony Joshua (23-1). In that scenario, oddsmakers still have Fury the favorite, but smaller at 1/2 (66.67 percent). Joshua is at 6/4 (40 percent).</p>
<p>Fury says he, too, wants Joshua, in what would be a battle for Britain. But he has unfinished business with Wilder.</p>
<p>“I’m going to take him [Wilder] out again for a third time, hopefully end of the year, and then we’re going to go into 2021 for the biggest fight in boxing history between two British heavyweights – me and AJ,” Fury declared.</p>
