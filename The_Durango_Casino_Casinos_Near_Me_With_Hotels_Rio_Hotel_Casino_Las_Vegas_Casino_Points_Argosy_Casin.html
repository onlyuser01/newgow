    <h1>The Durango Casino Casinos Near Me With Hotels Rio Hotel Casino Las Vegas Casino Points Argosy Casin</h1>

<p>Spain vs Germany is arguably the most exciting matchup of Round 2 of the 2022 World Cup. It’s because Die Mannschaft are in desperate need of points after suffering a humiliating loss to Japan in the first round. Winning points against Spain won’t be easy as La Furia Roja is playing top-level soccer as evident from the fact that they obliterated Costa Rica 7-0 in Round 1.</p>

<p>Record-Breaking Spain Ready for Next Challenge</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Spain beat Costa Rica 7-0, which was their biggest victory at the World Cup in history. They absolutely dominated the game from the very start, keeping the ball in their possession 82% of the time. They made 17 goal attempts, while stopping Costa Rica players from creating any goal attempts.</p>
<p>The Red Fury were impeccable against Costa Rica, but can they do something similar against motivated Germany? It’s very unlikely they’re going to be able to dominate that game as Germans are great in the midfield.</p>
<p>But what about Spain’s defense? Should they fear German attacks? No one can say for certain because Germany looked horrible in the offense against Japan.</p>
<p>Germany’s Offense Needs to Improve</p>
<p>Germany was the dominant force against Japan, keeping the ball in their possession for 74% of the game and making 25 goal attempts. Unfortunately for them, only one went in – Ilkay Gundogan score the only goal for Germany from the penalty spot.</p>
<p>Hansi Flick will have to make some changes in the final third to make sure his team does better offensively. We might see Niklas Fullkrug start the game or Thomas Muller move to the striker position.</p>
<p>Flick will also have to make some changes in the backline. Niklas Sule will probably be dropped in favor of Thilo Kehrer on the right side. Kehrer is just way quicker than his 6’5 220-pound colleague.</p>
<p>There’s one section of the German team that doesn’t require any adjustments – midfield. That’s Germany’s strongest point, which will probably play a key role on Sunday. If Kimmich &amp; Co. establish dominance in the center of the pitch, Die Mannschaft will stand a chance against in-form Spain.</p>
<p>Spain vs Germany Prediction</p>
<p>Luis Enrique started two teenagers in the midfield three – Gavi (18) and Pedri (19). They did a fine job against Costa Rica, which is why they’re expected to start against Germany as well. However, we doubt they’re going to put the same level of performance once again.</p>
<p>Germany’s midfield players are going to run them over, keeping the ball in their possession throughout the game. The Germans are also going to create more scoring opportunities than Spain, but the question is how many of those will they turn into goals. Not too much is our answer, but we do think they’re gonna score at least once.</p>
<p>Picks: Double chance – Germany/Draw</p>
