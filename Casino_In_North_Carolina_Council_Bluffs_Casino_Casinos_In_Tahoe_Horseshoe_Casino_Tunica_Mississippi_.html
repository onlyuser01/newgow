    <h1>Casino In North Carolina Council Bluffs Casino Casinos In Tahoe Horseshoe Casino Tunica Mississippi</h1>

<p>Fanatics Sportsbook continues to secure new ground in the United States with the company now launching in then Centennial State</p>
<p>The move comes following the acquisition of the PointsBet assets in the state, allowing Fanatics Sportsbook to use the infrastructure that is already in place and secure a firm foothold in the state.</p>
<p>PointsBet Users Can Transition to Fanatics with Same Login Details</p>
<p>Effectively, sports fans can now download the dedicated iOS and Android apps and start betting using the Fanatics Sportsbook instead. The rollout is also the eighth state in which Fanatics Sportsbook has gone live this year, as the operator is gathering momentum in the highly competitive US wagering market.</p>
<p>The news comes amid significant changes in the gaming and betting landscape in the United States, with Kindred Group withdrawing from the sector and ESPN Bet kicking the front door in. Fanatics, though, is confident that it can drive steady synergies with the namesake apparel brand and utilize its large customer base and data to succeed as a sports betting operator. Some of these efforts have already hit a snag in Ohio, however.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players who are already registered with the PointsBet app in Colorado will be able to use their username and password to access the Fanatics betting app. Since August, Fanatics Betting and Gaming, which operates the sportsbook, has been working on the smooth transition of PointsBet operations under Fanatics’ banner.</p>
<p>Fanatics Continues to Expand as Competitors Fear It</p>
<p>So far, the operator has launched in Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia, along with Maryland, Massachusetts, and Tennessee. There are ten more states that are going live before long, Fanatics Sportsbook says, as the operator has firmly decided to position itself in a market that is currently dominated by the likes of DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM.</p>
<p>These market leaders are admittedly worried about the reinvigorated push by brands such as ESPN Bet and Fanatics Sportsbook, as those operators are backed by synergistic parents with a large war chest to deploy innovative and consumer-focused sports gambling products, although ESPN had to forego some of its betting shows, in what some speculated was a bid to cut costs.</p>
<p>Fanatics Sportsbook was also cleared in New York where the brand can take over the PointsBet assets. It would be interesting to see if Fanatics is interested in operating in the Empire States, as it charges a good 51% on betting operators’ gross gaming revenue. Right now, it’s a matter of succession – staying in the market would be a conscious decision.</p>
