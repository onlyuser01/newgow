    <h1>Virgin Online Casino Cherokee Hotels Near Casino Mardi Gras Casino Resort West Virginia Rio All Suit</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru &amp; Mr. L****,</p>
<p>Cloudbet takes responsible gaming very seriously, we have tools in place to detect and prevent excluded accounts from accessing the site whilst prohibited from doing so. Gambling should remain a form of entertainment within oneâ€™s own limits, we are sorry to hear about Mr. L**** continued troubles with problem gambling.</p>
<p>We further agree that Responsible Gaming is a shared responsibility, which is why we offer the tools we do and have a highly trained support team that handles these conversations.</p>
<p>In the case of the complainant, Mr. L**** created an account at Cloudbet on the 14th November 2021, placed a few sports and casino bets, and on the 15th November 2021 proceeded to contact support with a request for Cloudbet to refund all of the deposits made and to close the account.</p>
<p>Our customer support team, with a complete understanding of the situation, informed Mr. L<strong><em>* that we would not refund deposits made to the account, however, we will immediately close the account under an exclusion. Our team provided Mr. L</em></strong><em> with options to seek help for bringing his gambling under control. Mr. L</em>*** expressed no interest in our help and was only interested in obtaining the deposits made.</p>
<p>Mr. L**** then contacted support on the 17th January 2022with a complaint stating that Cloudbet allowed him to open an account, verify that account, and play. The secondary account was immediately closed.</p>
<p>Upon investigation our team detected an attempted sign-up from Mr. L**** on the 15th January 2022, which was blocked due to an exclusion in place, our system behaved correctly and as expected.</p>
<p>My L****, deliberately circumvented our registration blocks that are in place to try to set up an account, after having agreed to close his account. This breach of our terms and conditions and the agreed terms of a self-exclusion;</p>
<p>7.1.10.2. Only one account per customer/IP/household is allowed. If you attempt and/or successfully open more than one account, all of your accounts may be blocked, suspended or closed and any Cryptocurrency credited to your account frozen.</p>
<p>Once your account is self-excluded you will not be allowed to make use of Cloudbet services during the exclusion period. Can you confirm if you would like to proceed?</p>
<p>Mr. L**** had a balance on the account and it was agreed that Cloudbet will allow the player to withdraw the remaining balance, minus the welcome bonus that was claimed against the terms of a multi-account, the player was informed of the adjustment to the balance and informed that he was allowed to only withdraw from the account and that by doing so we will deem this as a resolution agreement and we will consider this case closed from both parties. We received no further reply, a withdrawal was requested and processed.</p>
<p>We later received a reply from Mr. L<strong><em>* informing us that he often excludes and creates subsequent accounts with other websites and seeks refunds and that Mr. L</em></strong><em> will be taking action against Cloudbet unless we refunded all of his deposits, despite agreeing to the resolution provided. It is without a doubt that Mr. L</em><strong><em> is fully aware of his actions and makes calculated attempts to bypass and create new accounts, Mr. L</em></strong>* does not seem to want to heed the advice given to seek assistance for his gambling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, given the fact that our systems behaved correctly and prevented Mr.L**** from creating an account, the player deliberately circumventing our system and the habit of bypassing other fraud detection systems with other casinos, the withdrawal which we allowed the customer to make and the advice given by our support team, Cloudbet deems the action taken to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>We will not be considering any further requests on this matter. We wish Mr. L**** the very best and hope that he seeks the appropriate assistance for his gambling.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Steve</p>
<p>The Cloudbet team</p>
