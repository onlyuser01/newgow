<p>DraftKings, the only legal sports betting operator in the state, posted revenue of $9.7 million</p>
<p>As sports betting continues to grow across the United States, more and more players across many states become involved in the hobby. This is strongly reflected in the increasing financial results posted by regulators across multiple jurisdictions. Oregon, for example, smashed its sports betting handle once again, posting a new all-time high figure.</p>
<p>For reference, bettors in The Beaver State wagered a total of $73.2 million on sports in December, surpassing the previous record of $71.9 million set in October last year. The figure is also 38.1% higher than the $53.8 million wagered in December 2022.</p>
<p>American football was the most popular sport in December and was singlehandedly responsible for almost a third of the total handle. For reference, football fans in Oregon wagered $23.1 million on football in December.</p>
<p>The second most popular sport was basketball, which attracted $16.5 million in wagers. Next up were soccer in ice hockey with $3.3 million and $2 million in wagers respectively.</p>
<p>Single bets remained overwhelmingly more popular, attracting $48.1 million in wagers. Parlay wagers, on the other hand, were responsible for $25.1 million of the total handle.</p>
<p>December was a record-breaking month for a number of other states as well, including Maryland. New Jersey and Massachusetts also posted strong results.</p>
<p>Oregon’s Revenue Smashed October’s Record</p>
<p>Oregon’s revenue results were also at their all-time high as DraftKings, the only legal sports betting operator in the state, posted revenue of $9.7 million. This figure represents a stellar 70.2% year-on-year increase and a 14.1% increase from October’s previous record of $8.5 million.</p>
<p>Sport by sport, the revenue metrics reflect the most popular sports in the state. Football was responsible for $3.5 million of the total revenue, followed by basketball at $2.9 million and football at approximately $606,000.</p>
<p>While single wagers were generally more popular, the revenue from parlay bets exceeded the revenue from singles. For reference, parlay bets generated $5.7 million in revenue, while single wagers brought in $4 million.</p>
<p>Last year, Oregon and DraftKings agreed to expand the number of available offerings, allowing fans in the state to wager on several more unusual disciplines. This included the Tour de France, Major League Baseball’s Home Run Derby, the American Cornhole League World Championship and, most notably, Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest.</p>
