<p>Digital gaming and sports entertainment company that offers regulated gaming, daily fantasy, and digital media products DraftKings has announced the upcoming launch of its online sportsbook app in Maryland. The launch will come ahead of the National Football League action on Thanksgiving and it will be preceded by an early access test period.</p>
<p>The New Sportsbook App Is Pending Approval</p>
<p>The app is pending regulatory approval on November 23, the following day after the mandatory testing period between November 21-22 will come to an end. The sportsbook app will go live for eligible customers in Maryland just in time for the NFL action on Thanksgiving. State customers can expect to enjoy a top-tier sports wagering experience as they will be allowed to place a number of versatile legal and regulated bets across professional sports leagues and collegiate sporting events. The list will include the National Hockey League, the National Football League, the National Baseball Association, and others. The list of bets that will be available to sports fans in Maryland will include player props, special odds boost selections, and same-game parlays, to mention a few of the announced alternatives.</p>
<p>The company’s president and co-founder Matt Kalish for North America expressed their thrill about launching the app in the context of the currently active sports season. Kalish also spoke about their products that are expected to deliver sports aficionados “an exciting sports betting experience”. He also thanked the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency, the General Assembly, governor Hogan, and the Sports Wagering Application Review Commission for allowing online sports betting in Maryland.</p>
<p>In 2021, DraftKings signed a sponsorship agreement with the professional American football team the Baltimore Ravens, turning into their Official Sports Betting Sponsor, this enables them to increase their engagement with fans of the team with the help of exclusive game day experiences, signed merchandise with players’ autographs, and the chance to take part in VIP-based events during the NFL season.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, DraftKings and Bay Mills Resort &amp; Casino opened their new retail sportsbook with a series of amenities and entertainment solutions for sports fans. New rumors about a potential historical deal underway between Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN and DraftKings generated a new buzz in October.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ special advisor to the board of directors Cal Ripken spoke about the sports gaming industry and its ongoing growth in the country, emphasizing the need to enter this space while partnering with a company known to focus on responsible gaming. Ripken has been selected to lead the DraftKings team in Maryland ahead of the big launch.</p>
