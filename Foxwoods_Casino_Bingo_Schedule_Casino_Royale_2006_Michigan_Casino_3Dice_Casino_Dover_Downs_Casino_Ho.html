<p>Developer of skill games Pace-O-Matic (POM) welcomed in a written statement Virginia’s court decision to extend the injunction allowing skill games to continue operating in the state.</p>
<p>Skill Games Operations to Continue</p>
<p>Greensville County Justice Louis R. Lerner extended the operation of skill games in Virginia, at least until the spring of 2023 when the new trial date is planned for, and the nation’s leader in developing skill games responded via its spokesman, Michael Barley.</p>
<p>Thanking Hermie Sadler and his legal team for their efforts to protect the interest of small businesses that are dependent on skill games revenue, Barley expressed the company’s contentment that “legal skill games will continue operating in Virginia,” helping small business owners across the state generate much-needed revenue.</p>
<p>“We anticipate the final court decision will uphold the legality of skill games in the commonwealth,” Barley continued, stressing the need for “further regulation and additional taxation” if taxpayers are not to continue “missing out on nearly $100 million in tax revenue that could have gone toward critical projects along with curbing illegal games that are proliferating in Virginia communities.”</p>
<p>Barley’s comments refer to Virginia not collecting tax revenue on skill games during the ongoing injunction after one year ago Emporia-based NASCAR driver and small business owner Hermie Sadler turned to the court and won an injunction to allow operations to continue pending the outcome of his appeal.</p>
<p>Important Source of Revenue</p>
<p>Skill games generated nearly $140 million in tax revenue for the state’s Covid Relief Fund and local municipalities from July 2020 until July 2021, providing funds for vital public services, and Barley was adamant that they still have a role to play within the current economic environment.</p>
<p>“If these games were important enough to support small businesses during COVID,” he continued, convinced that skill games “should be allowed to continue operating in a regulated market” and help the businesses manage the ongoing economic downturn.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is another state where skill games are being placed on the chopping block and POM is entangled in lawsuits to maintain the games’ existence and protect the interest of its small business partners.</p>
<p>In October, the state’s largest land-based gambling venue, Parx Casino, and its operator, Greenwood Racing, filed a lawsuit against the Georgia-based skill games developer, claiming unfair competition and arguing the gambling machines distributed by POM across bars, restaurants, gas stations, and corner stores that are labeled as skill games machines are in essence illegal slot machines.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, POM filed a lawsuit against the state’s Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement (BLCE), claiming that the regulator had engaged in coordinated actions to harass Pennsylvania Skill location owners and operators.</p>
