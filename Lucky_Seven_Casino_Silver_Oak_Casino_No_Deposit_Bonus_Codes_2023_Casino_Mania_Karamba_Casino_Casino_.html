<p>I do not have a BTC wallet ...what are you talking about ?</p>
<p>I don't even know what it is.</p>
<p>If you're talking about Bitcoin I do not do anything with cyber currency.</p>
<p>you have everything you need to see that there was no deposit for $80 in my account on the month of May quit playing games.</p>
<p>Send me my $80 or I will initiate an investigation I love your company with the US government and the banking system and I will file negative reviews about your casino on the internet and I will make life hell for you.</p>
<p>I did not exhaust the money it was never even played. Only my first deposit of $100 did I play which had nothing to do with this $80 refund you promised.</p>
<p>Send me my money</p>
<p>God Blesses You as Love,</p>

<p>Dear William,</p>
<p>Thank you for your request.</p>
<p>We'd kindly ask you to abstain form any kind of threats towards the casino as having registered with the website you have chosen to honor the Terms and Conditions of El Royale. Moreover, I'd like to remind you that having placed the deposit, the services have been used and the balance has been played down.</p>
<p>We'd like to point out that the screenshots provided does do not contain all the required data in order for us to neither confirm nor deny the fact that the refund hadn't been received. That is why we had requested the full statement, which you refused to provide us with, therefore, our assistance on the matter.</p>
<p>Please note due to the fact we cannot confirm the fact that the refund is indeed missing and cannot resend the transaction that has already been processed, we can only offer for the transaction to be sent to the BTC wallet of yours. In order for us to do so, please reply to this email with the BTC wallet of yours so we could resend the transaction in amount of $80.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Taylor Ellis</p>
