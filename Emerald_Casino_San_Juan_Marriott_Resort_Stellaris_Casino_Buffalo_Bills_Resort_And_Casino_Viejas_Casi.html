    <h1>Emerald Casino San Juan Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino Buffalo Bills Resort And Casino Viejas Casi</h1>

<p>Today, after a withdrawal request, I received a request to validate my account. So far a normal process, as I am used to playing in several casinos and it is a security procedure.</p>
<p>I went to the chat to understand, I sent the photo of my ID and it seems to have been accepted, although the attendant didn't make it very clear, he just asked for a selfie showing my face, the casino screen and the ID.</p>
<p>I waited some time to send as I was busy, and when I tried to go to the website again to attach the photo, my account is blocked. So I couldn't comply with the request?</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
