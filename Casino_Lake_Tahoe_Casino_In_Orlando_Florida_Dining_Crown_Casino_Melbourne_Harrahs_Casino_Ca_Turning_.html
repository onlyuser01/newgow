<p>At the end of February, Penn National Gaming partnered with Rush Street Interactive in a move that would help the latter enter more US gaming markets. Now, Penn National Gaming has announced it would expand its exclusive myheroes program to show support for the company’s employees who are first responders, veterans, and active-duty members. The decision is aimed at honoring and showing more recognition to national heroes, with a direct emphasis on the company’s employees who fall in one of the previous categories.</p>
<p>One-Year Anniversary for the myheroes Program</p>
<p>The myheroes program that was launched in May 2021 reached the impressive 100,000 members mark in February. To celebrate the accomplishment, Penn National Gaming donated $100,000 to local organizations supporting veterans. Now, to further celebrate its team members who “have served and sacrificed” on its one-year anniversary, the program will be expanded with a multi-dimensional component, according to the company’s chief executive officer and president Jay Snowden. The employee-focused approach is set to help Penn National Gaming create a powerful network consisting of ambassadors across its brick-and-mortar properties.</p>
<p>The selected ambassadors will assist the company’s human resources and marketing crews at different land locations, with the purpose of building promotional events and calendars centered around important anniversaries, holidays, and various celebratory events meant to honor heroes.</p>
<p>The same ambassadors will also be responsible for searching for even more engagement from local organizations connected to the military, veterans, or first responders.</p>
<p>Penn National Gaming’s myheroes Program, “Truly Meaningful”</p>
<p>Since crossing its 100k mark in February, the program is said to have grown even more, reaching 125,000 members interested in showing their support and appreciation for the heroes in their local communities. The Penn National gaming crew developed the program in a way that would make it “truly meaningful” while turning it into the “best-in-class” for national heroes, including its own employees. The new extension is expected to further broaden and stimulate the program’s success, a goal that has remained a top priority for the company. myheroes offers the country’s veterans, active-duty members in the military, and first responders along with their selected companions exclusive discount deals, promotions, and access to one-of-a-kind events held at the 44 properties owned by Penn National Games in 20 US states.</p>
<p>The myheroes program, which represents an extension of the company’s mychoice rewards program, convinced its members to pay more than two million visits to its properties since its launch one year ago.</p>
