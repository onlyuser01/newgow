    <h1>Everett Casino Springbok Casino Poker Stars Casino Cesar Casino Bakersfield Casino BetU Releases NFT</h1>

<p>BetU, an online gambling company claiming to be the most rewarding crypto sports betting and casino platform, has launched a new NFT-inspired slot called NFTreasure. The fresh title features famous NFTs from the world’s most popular collections.</p>
<p>BetU and Zillion Games Released NFTreasure</p>
<p>BetU’s new title is a 5×3 slot that features many famous NFTs from famous collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and Crypto Punks. Other similar collections include Neo Tokyo, Doodles, MoonBirds, VeeFriends and Azuki. In addition, players can expect to see famous NFTs owned by popular blockchain influencers such as Alex Becker and JRNY Crypto.</p>
<p>The new title is developed with the invaluable help of Zillion Games, a game development studio that prioritizes delivering the highest levels of player satisfaction and involvement. When spinning the reels, players can land on various rare NFTs and earn prizes depending on the paylines.</p>
<p>Lucky players may land on five symbols spelling BetU’s name with the company’s official logo on the final reel. When they do, players will trigger a bonus game where they will have to pick one of three prizes at random. Players can earn varying monetary prizes, depending on their choice.</p>
<p>CEO Rogash Called the Game a “True Gamechanger”</p>
<p>BetU’s chief executive officer, Paul Rogash, spoke about the fresh title. He said that innovation is always at the forefront of BetU’s priorities, which is why it sought to create a unique and innovative slot experience. Rogash noted that NFTreasure seeks to plunge players into the world of NFTs and engage NFT enthusiasts with a game featuring many beloved NFT pieces. The CEO concluded that this is the first time these NFTs have been used in a slot title.</p>
<p>This is the first time many of these digital assets have featured on the reels of a slot game, and the early signs from players at BetU.io are that this is a true gamechanger. Paul Rogash, CEO, BetU</p>
<p>BetU launched on the market only a month ago and is already doing its best to innovate the market with creative experiences. While it is not the first cryptocurrency-oriented online gambling brand, it stands out from its competitors thanks to the exclusive benefits for players using the native $BETU token.</p>
<p>As of the time of this writing, $BETU tokens are worth $0.02783. Customers who wish to make the most out of their time with the operator can grab some to instantly level up their experiences.</p>
