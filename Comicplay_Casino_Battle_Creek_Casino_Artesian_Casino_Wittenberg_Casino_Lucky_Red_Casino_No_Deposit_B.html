    <h1>Comicplay Casino Battle Creek Casino Artesian Casino Wittenberg Casino Lucky Red Casino No Deposit B</h1>

<p>Dear Chad,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your withdrawal problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. Have you completed KYC verification successfully? Was this your first withdrawal request in this casino? Furthermore, could you please specify how many days ago you have requested the withdrawal?</p>
<p>It’s quite usual for withdrawal, to take a couple of days or even weeks to get fully processed. This means that it may take some time before your money appears in your account. However, I believe we will be able to help you to resolve this issue and receive your winnings as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
