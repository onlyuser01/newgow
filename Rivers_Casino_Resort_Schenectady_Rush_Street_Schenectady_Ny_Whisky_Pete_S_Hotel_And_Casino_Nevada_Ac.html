<p>ESIC and Denuvo will develop a framework aimed at more effective results in the fight against match manipulation</p>
<p>The Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC) announced it has signed into a partnership with Denuvo by Irdeto to collaborate with the global games protection and anti-piracy technology provider on solutions against cheating and match manipulation in esports.</p>
<p>Tightening the Grip on Match Manipulation</p>
<p>The Anti-Cheat Partnership with Denuvo by Irdeto made the tech supplier the first-ever anti-cheat partner of the global esports integrity watchdog, signaling willingness from both organizations to join forces and develop a sophisticated approach to tackling cheating and esports manipulation.</p>
<p>Proud to announce the partnership with Denuvo, ESIC’s director of Global Strategy and Partnerships, Stephen Hanna, outlined that the partnership’s objective would be to strengthen “the role of anti-cheat providers in the maintenance of competitive integrity within the esports industry.”</p>
<p>“As a distinguished partner to the games industry, Denuvo is well poised as our first anti-cheat partner to work with us in finding and executing upon more sophisticated applications for anti-cheat technology to tournament operation,” Hanna concluded.</p>
<p>Seeking to develop a framework that will bring anti-cheat technology to the esports industry, Denuvo will provide ESIC with its Anti-Cheat software and keep the integrity body updated on particular data metrics related to integrity and industry risk via periodical reports.</p>
<p>On behalf of Denuvo by Irdeto, Steeve Huin, chief operating officer, Video Games Security, expressed the company’s excitement “to fight piracy and cheating on the fast-growing esports segment” alongside ESIC, keen to ensure a level playing field in esports.</p>
<p>“As gamers ourselves, we at Denuvo are dedicated to bringing fairness and fun back to online gaming and are therefore thrilled to ensure the same fair game opportunities will be available for the players of esports,” Huin added.</p>
<p>Insights and Support</p>
<p>Denuvo’s role will be to support the ESIC in its continuous efforts to deliver best practice standards and integrity frameworks to the broader esports industry by providing insights into the industry’s pain points and promoting fair play.</p>
<p>With over 50 years of expertise in security, Denuvo by Irdeto is the world leader in digital platform cybersecurity, providing services and solutions that protect revenue, enable growth and fight cybercrime in video entertainment, video games, and connected industries, including transport, health and infrastructure.</p>

<p>The announcement of the anti-cheat partnership came right before the return of the ESIC Global Esports Summit (EGES) set to take place on February 9-10 at ExCel London and gather publishers, tournaments organizers, teams, non-endemics, media and other esports stakeholders to discuss hot industry topics.</p>
