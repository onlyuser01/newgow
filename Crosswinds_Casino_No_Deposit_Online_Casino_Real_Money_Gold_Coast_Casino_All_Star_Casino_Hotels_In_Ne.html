<p>Betting industry content and production services supplier Sports Information Services (SIS) announced today the appointment of two key figures, Brenda Strickland and Sean Beirne, who joined the ranks at the company’s US subsidiary SIS Content Services Inc.</p>
<p>The appointments of Strickland and Beirne as Regulatory Manager and Business Affairs Manager respectively is the latest display of the company’s resolve to establish its presence in the booming US sports betting market, partnering with both online and retail sportsbook operators to offer them its horse and greyhound racing and esports products.</p>
<p>Banking on Fixed-Odds Horse Racing and Esports Betting</p>
<p>Michele Fisher, SIS Content Services’ vice president, who used to work with both Strickland and Beirne, reiterated the company’s strong beliefs that the market in the US would continue to expand with fixed-odds horse racing and esports betting.</p>
<p>“With that in mind, it was always our plan to enhance our team with top-class hires from within the industry. Having previously worked with both individuals, I am confident each will make an immediate impact within the SIS team.” Michele Fisher, VP, SIS Content Services</p>
<p>Former Senior Paralegal and Contract Manager at Sportech Strickland will leverage her expertise across compliance, legal and operations within regulated industries and assume responsibilities related to the administration and maintenance of the company’s compliance, licensing and reporting functions in the US. Strickland’s primary focus will be on compliance with the regulatory requirements in the different states and management of internal corporate policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Kentucky native and former director of the Equine Industry Program at the University of Louisville Business School Beirne has over 30 years of racetrack management, operations, regulation, and education experience and will be responsible for building relationships with US sportsbooks to facilitate the sales of SIS’ live betting content.</p>
<p>Beirne, who also used to serve as VP of Racing &amp; Simulcast at Mile High Racing &amp; Entertainment, Director of Racing, Simulcasting, PR &amp; Track Announcer at The Old Evangeline Downs, and a Colorado State Racing Commissioner, will be navigating the regulatory aspects of SIS’ content distribution across sportsbooks to help maximize global horse racing right holders’ global content distribution.</p>
<p>State Rollout to Continue</p>
<p>SIS chief executive officer and president of SIS Content Services Richard Ames outlined the “huge opportunity” for growth the US market presents in particular with the state rollout of fixed-odds betting and the “advancement in esports betting regulation,” hailing the two appointments that will strengthen the company in its efforts to affirm its presence in the market.</p>
<p>“I believe the combination of knowledge, expertise and regulatory and commercial acumen they bring with them will prove to be of huge benefit not only to SIS Content Services but also all of our US partners.” Richard Ames, CEO, SIS</p>
<p>The appointments of Strickland and Beirne followed shortly after SIS reshuffled its managerial team with the promotions of Head of Trading Adam Conway to Head of Competitive Gaming and Racing Trading Manager Aiden Tracy as Head of Racing Trading.</p>
