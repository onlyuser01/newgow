<p>The new content agreement further grows Wizard Games' presence in Canada and enables its games to reach new customers</p>
<p>The fast-growing provider of iGaming content and NeoGames subsidiary, Wizard Games, continues to expand its presence in North America. On Monday, the company revealed it joined forces with the Atlantic Lottery. The collaboration marks the debut of Wizard Games’ content for Atlantic Canada and strengthens its foothold in the country.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new content agreement, games from the leading provider that have proven their popularity are now available for the Lottery’s customers. Judging by a statement released by Wizard Games, the launch of its content will be facilitated through Pariplay’s cutting-edge aggregation platform, Fusion.</p>
<p>Per the new collaboration, Atlantic Lottery, also famous as Loto Atlantique, will deliver fan-favorite titles from Wizard Games. Such include Spirit of Mustang and Flamin’ 7’s, among other thrilling games that already enjoy strong popularity in the country.</p>
<p>Loto Atlantique is a government-regulated and run lottery that offers responsible gambling options for the Atlantic Canada region. The organization is owned publicly by the region’s four provinces and 100% of its profits are returned to local governments.</p>
<p>The latest agreement further strengthens Wizard Games’ presence in Canada. Previously, the subsidiary of NeoGames rolled out its games for AGLC in Alberta and also signed multiple deals in Ontario. Last month, Wizard Games announced the launch of a new 5×4 slot game featuring a women’s sports theme called Cup Glory.</p>
