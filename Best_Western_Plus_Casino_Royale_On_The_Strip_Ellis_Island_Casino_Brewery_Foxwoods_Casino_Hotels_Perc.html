    <h1>Best Western Plus Casino Royale On The Strip Ellis Island Casino Brewery Foxwoods Casino Hotels Perc</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru</p>
<p>I hope you can help me. I found Icecasino and made an account as it looked like a good casino. I paid in 50 DKK over two transactions, thus 100 DKK in total. I lost the money and my bonus money. I still had 120 peace spins left which I used the next day, for them I won 300kr, which I then activated and played through 35 times. I now have 1800 DKK in real balance. I first try to pay out without KYC and the request is rejected. I also do not have the option to pay by credit card, only bank transfer. I'm told by chat support that I need to complete the KYC process. I do that and then get approved within a few days. I am again trying to pay by bank transfer, which is the only withdrawal option I have. There are two days where the status is "in progress", after which the request is rejected. I am writing to the chat as writing it is still being processed and that I should check again in a few hours. After a few hours it is still rejected and I contact the chat again. This time they are blaming technical issues and that I should try to create a new request. I have now done so and am very skeptical. Can it really fit you have to create four requests to get your money, you really have to wait several weeks before something finally happens, and you really have to lie and fight with the company all the way through the process. After all, there are no problems when it comes to deposits, and I feel it is an abuse of the customer's trust, time and finances.</p>
