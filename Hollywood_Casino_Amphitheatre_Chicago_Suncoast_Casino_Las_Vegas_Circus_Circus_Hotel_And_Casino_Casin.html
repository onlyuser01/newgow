    <h1>Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Chicago Suncoast Casino Las Vegas Circus Circus Hotel And Casino Casin</h1>

<p>Got Scammed by this Casino I don't really remember when i created my account this casino but they keep sending me free spin bonus which i rarely play. I like to play deposit bonus than free spins.</p>
<p>I deposited many time my account is been 2018 I think when the old site name parisvipcasino turned to this vivemoncasino if I remember it right. That is how I got signed since and I deposited some last year and just recently i deposited 50â‚¬.</p>
<p>So last January 17 I deposited 50â‚¬+ 100% bonus =100â‚¬ which I successfully wagered.</p>
<p>In my account i already won 1100+ euro something which I can withdraw but due to verification I submitted the remaining documents since my Identity is been verified long time ago I think for long time since my account from the old site i think is verified. so only updated documents like the proof of address and my credit/visa card I need to re submit. I keep asking them in live chat after 2days and 3days to follow up the validation of my remaining documents. Then on friday afternoon after I asked again the live chat they told me it will be verify soon blah blah.</p>
<p>Then I log out the. same day I asked again a bit late in the afternoon when I try to log in my account already disabled without even notice or email why. Casino should verify all account I deposit multiple times in the past but now that I return and play thay casino again since weekly i receive free spins ðŸ’¢ which i don't even play/use.</p>
<p>I playing casino for many years now if I have multiple accounts which I know I don't have since my account here is created since 2018 after they change name into vivemon from parisvipcasino. Even depositing here quite suspicious since. no proper email from them i received only generated email which unlike other casino when you deposit they have formal email with the casino name that you successfully deposited money.</p>
<p>I hope you can help since I don't receive any reply yet from them. They should give me valid reasons why they disabled my account after I'm trying to submit my remaining documents. My identity card is been verified only proof of address and banking details.</p>
<p>Many complaints not only me which they just disabled account. They should improve account filtering and not allowing players to deposit if they found the they have multiple accounts. Scamming players to deposit and blocked it if they won nad want to withdraw is really stupid and scamming players. Could someone help me hear Honestly I dont even need to claim my supposed wins which I wagered around 1k+ euro I'm ok if they just reimbursed and bring back all my deposits. A casino who only wants to eat money from players then block it when they want to withdraw is plain bullshit scamming.</p>
<p>I'm from france I will complaints too to block this casino and all sister name casino here so many players will avoid this casinos scamming.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone can help me here too I will complaint to other site as well to report this casinos</p>
