    <h1>Black Hawk Colorado Casinos Wow Vegas Online Casino Casino Royale Vesper Lynd Tampa Hardrock Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Gurkan,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the casinos General T&amp;Cs (https://rocknrollacasino.com/page/terms-and-conditions) and I found this:</p>
<p>"3.2 You are allowed to have only one Member Account. Only one Account for each household, IP, PC is allowed. If you attempt to open more than one Member Account, all accounts you try to open may be blocked or closed and any bets may be voided. Also any returns, deposits, winnings or bonuses which you have gained or accrued during such time as the Duplicate Account was active will be forfeited by you and may be reclaimed by us, and you will return to us on demand any such funds which have been withdrawn from the Duplicate Account. If you wish to open another account, you may do so by contacting the Manager at support@RockNRollaCasino.com. If a new account is opened, the old account will be closed. If you notice that you have more than one registered Member Account, you must notify us immediately. Failure to do so may lead to your Member account being blocked for access."</p>
<p>Is there any possibility that someone from your household, or someone using the same IP created an account at the Rock N Rolla Casino?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
