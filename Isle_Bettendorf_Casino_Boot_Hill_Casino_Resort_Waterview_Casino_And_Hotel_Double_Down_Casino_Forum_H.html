<p>On Wednesday, Nevada horseplayers received good news from the Gaming Control Board, which grants racebooks to accept bets on more races from Churchill Downs, not just Kentucky Oaks, and the Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>Nevada Horseplayers with More Betting Options</p>
<p>Nevada Gaming Control Board has granted racebooks the right to allow horse bettors to bet on more races, including Churchill Downs, not just the Kentucky Oaks on Friday and the Kentucky Derby on Saturday.</p>
<p>The announcement came on Wednesday. Even though horse bettors will still have limitations in their betting activity, they will have broader options to choose from than they had in 2020.</p>
<p>Board Chairman J. Brin Gibson approved regulated racebooks to use the national television on NBC and NBC Sports Network to broadcast, determine winners, and payouts on 6 graded stakes races on Friday and 7 on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Friday, station racebooks will offer a $10,000 twin quinella and a $20,000 twin Q on Saturday. According to Gibson, for players to bet, “the races must be shown live in their entirety,” otherwise the wagers will be refunded to patrons.</p>
<p>No sources, apart from the officially accepted ones, can be used to determine winners and payouts. A spokesman of the gaming board stated that a commercial break after the horses finish the line will not violate these requirements if the results follow after that.</p>
<p>Nevadans Could Soon Wager on Races from Churchill Downs</p>
<p>As Nevada Pari-Mutuel Association and Churchill Downs Inc. have entered discussions on a deal, Nevada horse bettors could soon see more wagering options for races from Churchill Downs.</p>
<p>The two parties discuss a deal that would end the 18-month contract disagreement. Up until now, it has prevented players from Nevada to bet on races from Churchill Downs. Even if the association and the company don’t find a resolution, local racebooks would still allow wagering on more races.</p>
<p>Even if the discussions don’t come through, other casinos plan to offer wagering options on Churchill Downs races, including trifectas, pick 3s, and daily doubles. All horse race rules will apply.</p>
<p>Nevada and Horse Racing</p>
<p>Nevada is known as the US capital of gambling. In 1931, the state legalized most forms of it, including betting. Today Las Vegas is the heart of its gaming operation. Interestingly enough, Nevada has never approved a state lottery. In March last year, the state was severely hit by the pandemic, as gaming revenues for the month, slumped 39.6%.</p>
<p>There are currently a few race tracks operating in Nevada. However, horseplayers and visitors have many opportunities to bet on races in other states, as many casinos offer racebooks from almost every out-of-state track.</p>
