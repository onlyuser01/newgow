<p>Joker King review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is hosted by a gleeful joker who has been crowned king. The theme is a fruit machine with a deck of cards twist.</p>
<p>Leaning over the reels in a bobbing joker hat and crown made of spades, this character challenges the player with a handful of gold coins.</p>
<p>This game has a classic casino vibe with its fruit symbols and bars of gold. The festive atmosphere feels sinful and indulgent.</p>
<p>The glitz and glamour have a hint of macabre about them though. Players will feel they’ve entered an exciting but slightly dark world.</p>
<p>Sensational win in the Joker King slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>There’s something maniacal about the Joker King’s smile. With glinting blue eyes and all his teeth bared, he brings to mind a classic Batman villain. Beneath the carnival aesthetic, lunacy seems to be lurking.</p>
<p>The Joker King animates to toss his handful of gold up and lean towards the player. This adds life to the charismatic character.</p>
<p>The cherries are particularly exquisitely animated, with a glossy sheen giving them dimension. All the symbols have a lifelike detail and certainly look alluring.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a very danceable tune that sets a lighthearted tone. The upbeat vibe is hard to sustain though, and some players may inevitably hit mute.</p>
<p>The golden reels themselves are crowned with a pile of coins, making it clear that cash rules in this world.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play's Joker King is a six reel, four row slot, with 25 win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay is fast and exciting. The bonus opportunities add fun variation as well (see below).</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. When it lands, another paying symbol is chosen at random to transform into a Wild as well.</p>
<p>Each Wild symbol turns other paying symbols into Wilds to maximize winning potential</p>
<p>Scatter symbols will have random multipliers (x2, x3, x5, x10, x10, or x25). This multiplier is applied to players’ total win after a spin. Multiple Scatter symbols will have their multiplier values added together.</p>
<p>If a player lands 3 or more scatters, they are awarded x1 their total bet.</p>
<p>Free Spin rounds are awarded when players land 3 or more Scatter symbols. The number of free spins received goes up depending on how many Scatters landed:</p>
<p>3 Scattes – 8 free spins</p>
<p>4 Scatters – 10 free spins</p>
<p>5 Scatters – 15 free spins</p>
<p>6 Scatters – 20 free spins</p>
<p>The maximum wins is limited to x5,000 the player’s bet. The round will conclude if this amount is reached.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
