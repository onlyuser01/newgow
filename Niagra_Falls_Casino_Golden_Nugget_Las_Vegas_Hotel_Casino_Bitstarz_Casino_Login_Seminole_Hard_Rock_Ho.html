<p>Videoslots, the leading online casino operator, confirmed a new senior-level hire earlier this week. The company announced selected Anna Komemi, an expert with nearly two decades of experience within the iGaming vertical, for the role of Chief Operating Officer (COO).</p>
<p>Joining Videoslots, she will oversee the company's daily operations. She will be in charge of strategic processes, including resources, logistics and personnel, among others. As Videoslots' new COO, Komemi will leverage her extensive skill set and wealth of knowledge she accumulated throughout her colorful career within the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Most recently, she was employed by Marketplay. During her time with the company, Komemi held the role of CEO/Executive Manager for a total period of five years, allowing her to gain invaluable knowledge and insights. While Komemi was a part of Marketplay, she played an important role in the company's strategic and business plans. Her role was significantly important for the growth of the company.</p>
<p>In a statement, Komemi revealed that she is thrilled to become a part of the growing team of experts at Videoslots. "I’m excited to be joining Videoslots and look forward to helping the business develop to its full potential," she explained. Finally, Komemi outlined: "The team is made up of a fantastic group of industry professionals with great knowledge and experience, and I’m confident we can achieve our ambitions as we head into the new year."</p>
<p>Ulle Skottling, Videoslots' Deputy CEO, was also excited about the new senior-level hire. He said: "We are delighted to welcome Anna to Videoslots as her passion and commitment to the industry really shines through." Last but not least, Skottling revealed: "She has made a significant impact within the sector over nearly two decades and will undoubtedly strengthen our team as we look to expand in 2024."</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Komemi was a part of recognizable companies within the gambling sector, including Aspire, Playtech and Ladbrokes, among others. Her career in the sector started back in 2007.</p>
<p>Late last year, Videoslots confirmed it extended its casino license in Sweden. The announcement came after approval from the country's gambling regulator, Spelinspektionen. As a result, Videoslots was granted a license extension, allowing it to continue its operations through 2028. At the time of the announcement, Skottling praised the achievement, outlining that it represents a major success for the company. Additionally, he outlined that the extended casino license in Sweden complements Videoslots' growth plans for 2024.</p>
