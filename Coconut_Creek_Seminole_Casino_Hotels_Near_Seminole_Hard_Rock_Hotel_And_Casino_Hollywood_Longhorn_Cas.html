<p>The International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA) has strengthened its commitment to ensuring that global sports are protected by teaming up with the Portuguese online and gambling association (APAJO), the organizations revealed in a press release shared via email.</p>
<p>APAJO and IBIA have signed a Memorandum of Understanding that will see the two entities work together to further protect sports and sports integrity and promote a safe, responsible, and sustainable online betting environment.</p>
<p>The exact areas of cooperation are still a matter to debate, with both associations keen to embark on projects that can help add to the integrity and overall safety of sports. Both IBIA and APAJO will bring their dedicated skill sets and expertise to ensure that consumers and sports are protected in equal measures.</p>
<p>Integrity has been of particular concern and importance to global and regional watchdogs, as the legalization of sports gambling has called for new and stricter responses to attempts of manipulating games and results.</p>
<p>IBIA recently welcomed the decision of WPBSA, the global snooker organization, to suspend and ban ten professional players who have committed various infringements. The offenses were detected with the help of data provided by IBIA’s members.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new partnership between the associations, APAJO Executive Committee President Ricardo Domingues said that maintaining a beneficial environment for consumers and operators, as well as sports integrity, is precisely what the association’s goal is.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to enter into this agreement with IBIA, whose extensive work and knowledge in this domain will surely be extremely valuable," Domingues said, adding that the association was now looking forward to contributing on an international level and helping strengthen IBIA’s efforts in keeping sports safe and free of manipulation.</p>
<p>IBIA CEO Khalid Ali said that Portugal is an important market for IBIA and new members are always welcomed as the association seeks to strengthen its own position in global markets and ensure that it can offer a coordinated approach to achieve the common goals of its members.</p>
<p>Ali was further pleased to see APAJO join as the Portuguese market is one that has a strong regulatory framework that promotes the same goals as the associations do, and that seeks to uproot corruption, protect consumers, and create a betting landscape in which match manipulation is absent.</p>
<p>IBIA has recently expanded its efforts in Brazil, doubling down on its commitment to sports integrity in the Latin American region as a whole.</p>
