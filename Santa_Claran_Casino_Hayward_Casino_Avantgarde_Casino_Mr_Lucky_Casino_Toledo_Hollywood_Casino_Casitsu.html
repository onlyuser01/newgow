    <h1>Santa Claran Casino Hayward Casino Avantgarde Casino Mr Lucky Casino Toledo Hollywood Casino Casitsu</h1>

<p>The player has been paid. His withdrawal of funds were being checked by the Fraud department due to the large amount of card payments from different cards that were made. I am sure everyone here is aware of AML procedures.</p>
<p>The player's account was not suspended, the funds were not touched. When card payments are made, we are unaware whether the PM is a pre-paid, debit or credit card. All card payments undergo the same scrutiny for ownership.</p>
<p>The cashout request was made to a crypto wallet, a PM not matching the other depositing methods. This triggers additional checks. Numerous cashout requests prior to this one were recalled by the player. The one that the player did not recall, the one we are speaking about here, was 4 days old today. This is not an unreasonable amount of time considering the PM checks.</p>
