    <h1>Black And Mild Casino Beau Rivage Casino Casino Games With Best Odds First Council Casino Newkirk Ok</h1>

<p>Nobody likes a cheater and that applies especially to casinos. While some cases of card counting can result in trouble for patrons, casino employees can be subject to charges for negligence or in some cases cheating. Now a new report suggests that several people are facing charges over their alleged participation in a cheating scheme in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>As reported by CTV News Toronto, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) was contacted earlier this month over a scheme that took place at Pickering Casino Resort. The OPPâ€™s Enforcement Bureau was notified that a table games dealer at the casino was allegedly involved in the scheme along with visitors to the venue.</p>
<p>The tip resulted in an investigation by the gambling regulator in the province, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). That probe ultimately resulted in the arrest of four people, the OPP confirmed Wednesday. The four people allegedly involved in the scheme, are now facing charges.</p>
<p>Reportedly, an individual with the initials S.S. has been charged with four counts of cheating at play, criminal breach of trust, as well as four counts of fraud over CA$5,000 ($3,700). Another person that allegedly was involved in the cheating scheme is a 28-year-old resident of Mississauga with the initials S.S. A 24-year-old Brampton resident with the initials A.K. along with another individual from Brampton with the initials D.K. were also allegedly involved in the scheme.</p>
<p>The three people, who are believed to have participated in the illegal activity, were reportedly charged with fraud of over CA$5,000 ($3,700) as well as possession of property of over CA$5,000 ($3,700) obtained in an illegal way. Additionally, each of the three suspects reportedly faces four charges for cheating while playing.</p>
<p>It is yet to be confirmed what penalties each of the alleged participants in the scheme may receive.</p>
<p>AGCO Continues to Monitor the Gambling Market in the Province</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the gambling regulator in Ontario cleared Amelco, the leading supplier of services and solutions, allowing it to launch its services for clients in the province. To achieve this, Amelco secured a Gambling Regulated Supplier license from AGCO.</p>
<p>More recently, AGCO issued a CA$100,000 ($74,300) fine against Apollo Entertainment. The monetary penalty came after the regulator said that it uncovered breaches of the responsible gambling regulations by the operator. Allegedly, Apollo breached regulations related to intervention with high-risk players and failed to implement efficient voluntary self-exclusion options for its clients, the regulator said.</p>
