    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Hollywood Florida Casino In Albuquerque Nm Wonder Casino Luckyland Slots</h1>

<p>After signing a strategic partnership with Pragmatic Solutions for the launch of a Gibraltar-headquartered sports betting brand and ushering in Mark Kemp as the new chief executive officer at the end of April, DAZN BET is ready for even more strategic changes. The popular sports streaming company has announced the appointment of Gemma Burge as its new safer gambling head. Burge will be embracing her new position after spending the past eleven months as head of the UK safer gambling policy for William Hill.</p>
<p>Burge Will Be Joining a Fine Industry Line-up</p>
<p>DAZN Group’s freshest challenger sports betting brand seems more determined than ever to take the market by storm with a powerful team leading the way. Gemma Burge will be joining an already prestigious list of fresh additions to the team, including Mark Kemp, Sandeep Tiku, Shay Segev, and other popular names in the industry.</p>
<p>DAZN BET’s parent company DAZN is now led by Entain’s ex-chief executive officer Shay Segev. Segev has personally filtered a number of industry stars that would help the company strengthen its roster prior to the launch of the sportsbook scheduled sometime during the third quarter of the year. His first pick was Entain’s former executive Ian Turnbull who is currently DAZN’s new employee value proposition of betting and gaming.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, ex-chief executive officer for BoyleSports Mark Kemp also embraced a new position as chief executive for DAZN BET. Kemp joined former chief operating officer Sandeep Tiku who is currently DAZN’s chief technology officer. The five-start team is completed by William Hill’s former head of football and US sports Liam Barbour, currently serving as senior vice president of future product strategy.</p>
<p>Burge Is Relatively New to The Gambling Sector</p>
<p>Burge describes herself as an experienced operational risk manager with almost two decades of cross-industry experience. Four years ago, after spending a decade and a half working in the financial services industry, she decided to switch to the gambling sector. She joined the William Hill team and spent the last three years exercising her know-how as a safer gambling risk manager in starting 2019, continuing as head of safer gambling in February 2020 and head of UK safer gambling policy, strategy &amp; risk for almost a year starting June 2021.</p>
<p>Burge also spent two years and nine months working for Sky Betting &amp; Gaming as head of the real-time risk &amp; risk assurance, risk assurance manager, and operational risk manager.</p>
<p>She has robust risk management knowledge and a burning passion for process and control frameworks. Special emphasis is also put on her authentic, pragmatic, and collaborative approach that helps companies evolve at a quicker pace and with extra confidence instead of slowing them down. Burge knows just how to create and engage teams that perform at their highest potential.</p>
<p>Burge expressed her delight to embrace her brand new position as DAZN BET’s head of safer gambling. She also acknowledged her excitement to start working for the “incredible” brand on its way to an exciting new venture.</p>
