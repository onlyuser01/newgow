<p>After more than four months of building, the Mega Millions jackpot finally went out Friday night. The multi-state lottery announced a couple hours after its 11 pm ET drawing that one ticket won the $1 billion prize.</p>

<p>The winning ticket was sold at a Kroger supermarket in Novi, Mich., a Detroit suburb, according to the Michigan Lottery. Its holder can choose between taking annual installments over a 29-year period or a cash option of $739 million.</p>
<p>After taxes, that would work out to about $530 million.</p>
<p>The $1 billion jackpot was the third-richest lottery prize in US history, and second-biggest for Mega Millions. The largest was a $1.54 billion prize won on Oct. 23, 2018.</p>
<p>The winning numbers were 4-26-42-50-60, and the Mega Ball was 24.</p>
<p>It had been 37 drawings since the Mega Millions top prize was last claimed, the longest drought in the game’s history.</p>
<p>Initially forecast for $970 million, the Mega Millions jackpot hit the 10-figure mark thanks in large part to a $731 million Powerball prize going out on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Cash Value Versus Annuity</p>
<p>In most cases, when lottery jackpots reach astronomical figures, winners choose the cash option. While its millions less, it provides the winner with certainty.</p>
<p>As Mike Savage, CEO of 1-800Accountant, notes, the government taxes money upon receipt.</p>
<p>Right now, federal income taxes are low from a historical standpoint — and it’s impossible to know where they may be years from now,” Savage said. “This means that from a tax perspective, it could cost you more to take the annuity because tax rates are more likely to increase down the road than decrease.”</p>
<p>However, annuity expert Stan Haithcock contended at thebalance.com that the annual payment option offers a variety of protections for winners.</p>
<p>First, the annual payment is guaranteed income, and the smaller checks can help people better manage their money and reduce impulsive decisions.</p>
<p>According to information from Mega Millions, a $1 billion winner taking the annuity would receive $15 million this year. Each subsequent payment would be 5 percent bigger. So, the final payment in 2050 would be roughly $61.7 million.</p>
<p>Ten Win At Least $1 Million</p>
<p>Besides the jackpot, Mega Millions also awarded 10 $1 million prizes for people who matched the first five numbers. Two of those tickets will get $2 million, as they included the optional Megaplier in their purchase.</p>
<p>Of those 10 tickets, two were purchased in New York and two in Florida. The remainder were bought in Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, with the $2 million prizes going to tickets in North Carolina and Virginia.</p>
<p>Since the jackpot last went out on Sept. 15, 70 prizes worth $1 million or more were won.</p>
<p>In addition, Friday’s drawing also made 187 players at least $10,000 richer by matching four of the five numbers, as well as the Mega Ball. That included 31 winners who played the Megaplier and won $20,000.</p>
<p>The Mega Millions jackpot now reverts back to $20 million, or $14.7 million cash option, for the next drawing on Tuesday.</p>
