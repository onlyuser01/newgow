    <h1>Wynn Hotel And Casino Watch Casino Film Diamond Joe Casino Casino S Near Me Resorts Casino Axecasino</h1>

<p>Thank you for the update, dazbeeche76.</p>
<p>However, according to the information received from the casino representative outside the thread, you should have already been paid in full and received all the remaining funds/winnings. So, there should be no more funds in the account.</p>
<p>I was told that the difference could have been caused by conversions. Although it seems a bit much compared to your calculated disputed amount, I would like to clarify a few things because after going through your posts, screenshots, and game logs again, I noticed some discrepancies.</p>
<p>The game logs you provided upon submitting the complaint show that the last balance status was 90909.04 AUD (the last activity/play on your account), and it should have been on June 8, 2023. But your other screenshots show that you received 11,250 AUD (as one payment) on November 10, 2023. But this payment is in the transaction list as the last one, not the first one. So, it does not make sense that it would have been the first payment made to your payment method at the time the account was closed or when your balance was 90,909 AUD. It rather looks like those 11,250 AUD were a part of the 90,909 AUD that the casino was paying you out. So, it should not be counted on top of those 90,909 AUD, but as a part of them. Or, if I overlooked anything, please, correct me.</p>
<p>Now the questions:</p>
<p>When exactly was your account closed? Can you please provide me with a communication where the casino informed you about it, with a visible date and time?</p>
<p>Since your last balance was 90,909 AUD - which means that it was probably before the account closure, so you did not/could not play further, and it is the last status of your balance - do you have any proof of having a balance of more than 90,909 AUD at the time your account was closed?</p>
<p>To be honest, for now, it is not completely clear about the last funds paid to you. Where did they come from?</p>
<p>Feel free to post the requested directly here, in your posts, or send it to my email (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will also ask the casino for further details/evidence.</p>
