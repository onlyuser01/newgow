<p>Erin Blanchfield is 11-1 overall with her only loss happening by a split decision in 2019 when she was still fighting under the banner of Invicta FC. Since joining the UFC, she’s 5-0 with each of her last three wins happening by submission.</p>

<p>The most impressive thing about those wins is that they happened against some elite fighters, namely, JJ Aldrich, Molly McCann, and former champ, Jessica Andrade. When it comes to her wins by points, those happened against Sarah Alpar and Miranda Maverick.</p>
<p>Taila Santos Wants to Get Back to Her Winning Ways</p>
<p>Taila Santos is 19-2 in her professional MMA career, with her first loss happening on her UFC debut when she lost to Mara Romero Borella by a split decision. Her second career loss happened 14 months ago when she fought for the UFC Women’s Flyweight title – legendary Valentina Shevchenko defeated her by a split decision.</p>
<p>When it comes to her wins, 10 happened by knockout, but the last time she defeated someone by this method was in 2016. Since joining the UFC in 2019, she’s got three wins by points and one by submission.</p>
<p>Erin Blanchfield vs. Taila Santos Prediction</p>
<p>In her five UFC fights, Blanchfield landed a total of 14 takedowns, with three of those resulting in a submission win. That’s no surprise knowing that she’s a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu who’s been practicing grappling since the age of seven.</p>
<p>What might be kind of surprising is that she lands a lot of strikes in every fight. Her average is 6.06 significant strikes per minute, which is almost two times as many as Santos. Knowing this, it’s only logical to assume Blanchfield is going to continue her winning streak in the UFC. The only real question here is how she’s going to win – by submission, knockout, or decision.</p>
<p>If we had to pick of one those methods, we’d go with a win-by decision, mainly because her opponent is famous for being someone who never gives up.</p>
<p>Pick: Erin Blanchfield to win</p>
