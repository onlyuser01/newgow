    <h1>The M Casino In Las Vegas Westgate Resort Casino Hard Rock Casino Tampa Ameristar Casino Resort Spa</h1>

<p>Supplier of casino software Playson announced today that it entered into a content deal with OmniSlots that would see its portfolio of games rolled out to the online casino brand operated by the Full Force Gaming Group.</p>
<p>Slot Title Rollout</p>
<p>The new partnership deal agreed with the leading developer of gaming content will further strengthen OmniSlot’s offering of casino games, which already features over 1,000 titles powered by a fast-loading mobile platform that attracts players with its friendly customer service and enticing promotions.</p>
<p>We are happy to announce this deal with a company that has earned a deserved reputation for creating fantastic games. We are aware of Playson’s foothold in Europe and believe this partnership will help us enhance our online casino offering exponentially.” Robert Peters, CEO, Full Force Gaming Group</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Playson’s exciting range of slot titles, including its popular hits Book of Gold 2: Double Hi, Rise of Egypt Deluxe and Buffalo Power Megaways, will go live on OmniSlot’s platform to help the mobile casino offer its players the industry’s best gaming content.</p>
<p>This is an exciting deal for Playson as it sees us broaden our reach into markets that are in our focus. We have high expectations on how our content will perform. We are looking forward to working alongside the team at OmniSlots and delivering our premium range of games over the coming months.” Blanka Homor, Sales Director, Playson</p>
<p>The latest content deal with the Full Force Gaming Group-owned mobile casino brand further strengthens Playson’s position as a supplier of cutting-edge gaming content and showcases the broader appeal for its products and services across European markets.</p>
<p>The agreement comes hot on the heels of the content partnership Playson agreed with Malta-based iGaming operator Rootz earlier this month to supply the operator’s Wildz online casino brand with its suite of slot titles, among which are Divine Dragon: Hold and Win, Buffalo Power Megaways and Solar Queen.</p>
<p>September saw Playson enter two content partnerships, with Russian-based sports betting and online casino gaming brand FonBet to expand its iGaming offering in Greece, and with Bulgarian gaming group AlphaBet Gaming to deliver its comprehensive range of titles to the company’s new online casino brand, Alphawin.</p>
<p>In August, Playson teamed with sports betting and iGaming operator in Bosnia and Herzegovina Premier Sportska Kladionica to integrate its most popular games, some of its top slot titles, including Legend of Cleopatra, Book of Gold: Double Chance and Rise of Egypt, as well as classic games Funky Fruits and Timeless Fruit Slots, into the operator’s website.</p>
<p>The game developer also rolled out its Cash Blast promo tool to provide its iGaming partners with further opportunities for player engagement and retention.</p>
