    <h1>Casinos In Carson City Nevada No Deposit Free Spins Casino South Bend Indiana Casino Location Croc S</h1>

<p>Hello, my account has been fully verified. This was confirmed to me through the live chat and I was told that all the necessary documents were uploaded.</p>
<p>The Terms and Conditions state that withdrawal requests via bank transfer are processed within three days. I have had a 500â‚¬ withdrawal pending since Monday.</p>
<p>Every day I inquire about the status of the withdrawal. The live chat just repeats prewritten responses, "Unfortunately we are currently experiencing high volume. Therefore, there may be longer waiting times."</p>
<p>After two days, one of the live chat staff wrote to me, "Withdrawal requests firstly remain in the 'pending' status for 48 hours before they go into the 'queue' for processing for the withdrawal, which is quite unprofessional."</p>
<p>The casino is stalling for as much time as possible to pressure players to cancel their withdrawal.</p>
