    <h1>Restaurants In Circus Circus Casino Fontainebleau Las Vegas Casino Bay Mills Resort Casino Brimley M</h1>

<p>Dear Justindennis22,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I would like to warn you, that if your deposit has never been credited to your casino account, the only thing you can do is to contact your payment provider. They need to investigate, but bear in mind, that it’s a lengthy process that takes approximately one month. In these cases, the casino has its hands tied. Meanwhile, I would strongly recommend not to deposit any more funds until the issue is sorted.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if the e-wallet address to deposit funds into your account was visible on the casino’s website for all the players or if you were provided a unique one when opening the account?</p>
<p>Was it your first deposit in this casino?</p>
<p>If you have any supporting evidence, please forward it to petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
