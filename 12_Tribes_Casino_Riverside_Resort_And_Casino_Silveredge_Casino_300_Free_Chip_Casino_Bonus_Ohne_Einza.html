<p>Hey Michal I just want to say thank you so much for your time and help...</p>
<p>(Update) I was rejected again today</p>
<p>It seems like the 3d selfie is now good but proof of address and proof of payment were rejected it seems when there are multiple reasons the document or documents are not sufficient they will only give you one reason why then you upload again wait a week and they got a different reason why they can't accept it an example in my case is that I uploaded a picture of my tax receipt which is for 2023 and it was less than 3 months old it was rejected to my knowledge because it's a receipt not a tax bill (I didn't know this at the time) so they tell me it's because the p.o box so I upload another property tax document but in pdf a digital copy from the R.M they take another week to tell me it needs to be a photo of the document not a digital pdf but what they leave out is that it needs to be a bill not a receipt I was told this by a support agent at mr bet so I upload the 2023 property tax bill and wait a week then they say it wasn't accepted because it has to be no longer than three months old, it's blurry and my address is supposedly not on it but it is I pointed that out to support... also most or all ppl only get their property tax bill once a year so to have that fit within 3 months old is 25% chance lol</p>
<p>Next is my proof of payment which supposedly was rejected because it wasn't an original pdf... I sent the original pdf prior to the latest rejections and it was not accepted because the e transfer to their site... it just said etransfer sent on the right date they are looking for but it should say gigadat they said so I sent the ontop of the original pdf multiple screenshots of the gigadat transaction in detail with my account number that matches the account number on the pdf there is no other way to do this b.m.o and its original pdf is the way it is... so I went to my bank because all I've done thus far has been rejected so I asked my bank to send a pdf of the bank statement with an attached document showing the detailed etransfer to gigidat stamped by the bank with my same account number that can be linked to the bank statement this again was rejected there excuse was that it was scanned which I did not know at the time now they say it must be an original pdf showing all of October.... in my bank b.m.o I can only get up to October 19 in the statement if they need all of October it would have to be 2 pdf statements if I merge them into 1 pdf it wouldn't be an original and/or it would be considered edited lol so I dont know what to do now for proof of payment Or address I'm at a standstill the verification page has been refreshed today I can upload documents but I think it's best to wait for their reply to you before I upload anything because they are asking for documents that don't exist the way they say they should and dealing with gigadat in canada or other players that use b.m.o bank of montreal I'm sure they already know this... if you need any info from me just let me know and I'll get it to you a.s.a.p thanks again Michal for your time and help take care</p>
