<p>International gaming operator Betsson Group continues to expand in Latin America, proving its undying support for South American Soccer with a new sponsorship deal. In a new strategic move, the Swedish group behind the reputable sports and entertainment platform Betsson dot com has recently agreed to sponsor Colo Colo, the indisputable leader of the First Division in Chile.</p>
<p>Betsson Is Steadily Growing Its Brand Visibility in Latin America</p>
<p>The new deal is another important milestone that the group has crossed over the past few months in Latin America, in an attempt to improve its global marketing strategy and grow its visibility in the region.</p>
<p>The one-year contract will continue the long string of successful sponsorships that Betsson has agreed to in 2021 when it became the first digital betting partner of La Roja and covered its 2022 FIFA World Cup campaign, the naming sponsor of Liga 1 in Peru, the sponsor of the Campeonato de Ascenso in Chile, and the regional sponsor of CONMEBOL Copa América.</p>
<p>The new Colo Colo sponsorship is likely to bring Betsson the expanded visibility it is looking for, given the team’s prestige and popularity in LatAm. Colo Colo is the only soccer team in Chile to ever scoop up the coveted Copa Libertadores de América in 1991. In 2022, the prestigious tournament will once again reunite the most powerful premier soccer clubs under the CONMEBOL umbrella between February 7 and October 29.</p>
<p>Colo Colo will be one of the participants fighting for a new title against Bolivar, Lara, Olimpia Asuncion, Barcelona SC, Montevideo City, and other reputable clubs in the area. All eyes will be on the competition during which Colo Colo players will proudly wear the Betsson logo on the sleeves of their shirts, as per the new one-year agreement that may be renewed in 2023.</p>
<p>Colo Colo has also taken home an impressive number of 32 Primera División titles, which is more than any other soccer club in Chile has accomplished. The club is also the only team in the Chilean history of soccer to have never been relegated to division two.</p>
<p>Colo Colo’s President Edmundo Valladares has expressed the team’s excitement regarding the new sponsorship that will help them secure their position as a “valuable institution” in both the world of sports and on the global scene. The club’s Commercial Manager Samuel Pérez welcomed one of the most successful gambling operators on the planet to their “family of sponsors”, calling the partnership an important milestone as well as the start of a new stage for the Chilean soccer club.</p>
<p>Betsson has been an important actor in the gambling world for over five and a half decades, so Colo Colo’s association with it is expected to help the club climb higher on both the international and the local ladder.</p>
<p>Betsson’s commercial director for South America Andrea Rossi also added that the partnership, just like many others in the region, would help drive more growth into the club, eventually turning soccer into an even more “electrifying” sport than it already is.</p>
<p>The Chilean Primera División (called Campeonato PlanVital 2022 for sponsorship reasons) will begin on February 6, marking the 92nd season of the beloved competition in the country. All eyes will be on Colo Colo’s players wearing their new Betsson-marked jerseys, fostering an even deeper connection between the team’s fans and the Swedish operator.</p>
