<p>Habanero has signed up a partnership with Emara Play, helping the game developer strengthen its European and Latin American markets.</p>
<p>Emara Play to Boost Habanero’s Presence in LatAm, Europe</p>
<p>Premium developer of slot games Habanero has teamed up with Emara Play, an aggregator platform focused on Spanish-speaking and Latin American markets. This alliance will allow Habanero to seek a bigger market share in Europe and LatAm, which are the primary regions for the developer.</p>
<p>Already a popular brand in LatAm, Habanero seeks to strike deeper ties and make its products available to more players. The supplier is bringing a number of engaging games as well as promotional tools to facilitate operators in promoting the content.</p>
<p>Habanero is licensed in Spain from the Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego (DGOJ), meaning the company meets the industry standards set out by the country’s gaming regulator. This is doubly important as Spain is re-regulating its advertising space, with a particular focus on restricting gambling advertisement and the ties between sports clubs and gambling firms.</p>
<p>Habanero is now looking to team up with a number of Spanish operators, and the company has numerous high-profile partnerships planned down the pipeline. Thanks to the partnership with Emara Play, Habanero is able to boost its positions in the 16 markets in Europe where it operates. The company has most recently secured ONJN and MGA licenses from the Romanian and Maltese gaming regulators, respectively.</p>
<p>Ambitious Commercial Plans in Spain and LatAm</p>
<p>Habanero business development executive Vera Motto had this to say: “This deal is a testament to our commercial footprint in the European territory and beyond. We are delighted to partner with another important player in Spain in a move that boosts our exciting and ambitious commercial plans for both the Spanish and LatAm markets. Stay tuned for plenty more announcements to come!”</p>
<p>Motto was joined by Emara Play CEO Daniel Rubio, who shared that his company was confident in Habanero’s chances of success from the moment they saw its games. “They are a fresh and innovative company with a lot to offer the Spanish and LatAm markets,” Rubio added.</p>
<p>Emara’s focus remains on local providers who are capable of delivering quality games, he concluded. Earlier this year, Habanero entered the Italian market through a partnership with BLOX.</p>
