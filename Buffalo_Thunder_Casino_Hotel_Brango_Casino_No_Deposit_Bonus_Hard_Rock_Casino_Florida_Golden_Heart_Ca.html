<p>As Eurovision is just around the corner, and due to take place in the United Kingdom for the first time in 20 years, the British sportsbook has vowed to donate the proceeds to support Ukraine</p>
<p>Ukraine has been at war with its belligerent neighbor which illegitimately invaded the country in February 2022. The events ever since have been well-documented, with the United Kingdom taking the side of the victim.</p>
<p>William Hill Committed to Helping Ukraine</p>
<p>Now, William Hill wants to do its part and the company has vowed to donate 100% of its Eurovision profits to support displaced Ukrainian families. All bets placed on the contest through William Hill are going to be contributed to the Support Ukraine initiative, which is buying toys, staple foods, humanitarian aid for the displaced families, and more.</p>
<p>Commenting on this decision, William Hill spokesperson Lee Phelps has said that the company is committed to helping relieve the distress of millions of Ukrainians who have had their worlds upside down.</p>
<p>The Eurovision Contest was originally planned for Kyiv in 2023, but this is no longer going to be possible due to the ongoing war. “We must not forget the disasters Ukrainians are still battling through, and the continued support Ukrainians require both in their home country and for those who have sought refuge here in the UK,” Phelps added.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the initiative said that Ukrainians were immensely grateful for the kind welcome they received from the UK and British people. The initiative’s representative expressed gratitude for William Hill’s decision.</p>
<p>Support Ukraine Thanks William Hill for Kindness</p>
<p>“We are especially thankful to William Hill for their fantastic gesture to donate all profits from betting on the event to our cause. We are deeply touched,” they said. It’s not yet clear what the expected size of the donation would be, but William Hill is going to confirm a final sum on Monday.</p>
<p>Support Ukraine has been growing over the past months, with the charity eliciting more donations over the past months and assisting Ukrainians seeking refuge in London. The organizaiton has been donating food, toys, and humanitarian supplies, and even seeking to dispatch necessities to those still in Ukraine who live in the border regions of the Russian offensive, or de-occupied territories, and need different supplies.</p>
