    <h1>Miami Casino Casinos Open Near Me Buckys Casino Westgate Casino Casino Jackpot Slots Betmaster Casin</h1>

<p>I deposited to receive the 100% bonus up to 500 euros on sports that betmaster makes available to all customers every Saturday. I have also deposited, played and lost in the past. This time I won about 4,000 euros which was rightly reduced to 2,220 euros because the terms of this bonus provide for a maximum win of 5 times the bonus amount plus the deposit. So there were 2,220 euros of winnings recognized by the bookmaker, which was no longer a bonus. At this point I try to withdraw on ecopayz (method used to deposit), but the withdrawals are rejected and in live chat they tell me to withdraw with cryptocurrency. Then I go with the cryptocurrency, they tell me to wait to enter the latter as a withdrawal method and in the meantime they begin to ask for various documents to validate the account. I send everything that is requested of me regularly and after twenty days of continuous requests for documentation, which I have always fulfilled regularly, this email arrives:</p>
<p>"Hi, your account has been blocked due to suspicion of unfair gambling.</p>
<p>The decision was made by the security department after a thorough investigation, which includes an analysis of the gaming activity on the account.</p>
<p>The result of the investigation revealed a dishonest game that led to the permanent blocking of the account and the holding of funds on it.</p>
<p>The service department has no right to comment on such safety department decisions.</p>
<p>4.23.6.1. The Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any Client who has committed fraud or falsified or attempted to falsify the entry process or the progress of any Promotion, or has violated this Agreement, the Promotional Terms and / or the Specific Terms, or who may, in the opinion of the Company, damage the reputation and brand of the Company or the reputation of any company in the group. "</p>
<p>I have always respected the bonus rules by always playing in the sports section and always betting with the minimum odds indicated by the bonus, that is 1.80.</p>
<p>I thank you for your attention and for your help.</p>
