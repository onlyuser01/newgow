<p>BetMGM told Casino.org on Thursday that it launched the Borgata Arcade on the Borgata Online app and website. The Arcade features nontraditional iGaming content with classic amusements, including skeeball and arcade titles like “Street Fighter II.”</p>
<p>The Borgata Arcade debuted this week with 118 interactive titles, including dozens of Slingo products and celebrity-branded games from the likes of Wayne Gretzky, John Daly, Jimi Hendrix, Gordon Ramsay, Motorhead, and Guns N’ Roses.</p>
<p>Borgata Arcade offers an all-in-one place for players to find their favorite games,” said Matt Prevost, BetMGM’s chief revenue officer. “From the traditional shopping mall arcade to its popularity in home consoles, the arcade continues to evolve as BetMGM now brings it to life in iGaming.”</p>
<p>BetMGM players are being encouraged to try out the Borgata Arcade with a promotion that gives them the chance to win up to $1,000 in site credit after staking at least $20 in the Borgata Arcade.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the Borgata Arcade, BetMGM says its New Jersey iGaming platform is now home to more than 1,500 games, inclusive of slots, table games, live dealer offerings, arcade games, virtual sports, variety games, bingo, and keno.</p>
<p>Arcade Popularity</p>
<p>Atlantic City is bullish on arcades and amusements in what’s a presumed effort to attract new visitors to the casino town.</p>
<p>The Showboat’s former casino floor, which Caesars Entertainment operated until the resort closed in 2014, is today home to the “Biggest Arcade in America.” The Lucky Snake is a 200,000-square-foot arcade and indoor go-kart track. The Lucky Snake features more than 600 arcade games.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Harrah’s Atlantic City in the Marina District opened its amusement space called The Arcade. The 5,328-square-foot space “offers a high-energy, multi-sensory experience for all ages.” The Harrah’s Arcade features a giant claw machine and several VR games.</p>
<p>Dave &amp; Busters is also readying its first location in Atlantic City. The restaurant and kid-focused arcade is slated to open its 21,000-square-foot location in the Tanager Outlets shopping center next month.</p>
<p>Though arcades have lost some of their popularity and appeal in other parts of the country, amusements and carnivals have long been a staple of life for New Jersey youth.</p>
<p>The plot of the 1988 classic fantasy comedy movie “Big” involved Tom Hanks’ character, Josh Baskin, a young boy residing in a New Jersey town, asking a fortune-teller amusement machine called “Zoltar” to grant his wish to become “big.” The movie scene was filmed at the Palisades Interstate Park in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Market Leader</p>
<p>New Jersey is one of only six states where online casinos with slots and table games are allowed. iGaming is big business, as the interactive platform partners of the nine casinos in Atlantic City have generated gross gaming revenue (GGR) of more than $1.4 billion in 2023 through September.</p>
<p>Borgata’s online operations have led the way, with the casino’s online partners accounting for $375.8 million of the internet GGR. Along with BetMGM, Borgata is partnered online in New Jersey with PartyCasino, Stardust Casino, and Wheel of Fortune Casino.</p>
