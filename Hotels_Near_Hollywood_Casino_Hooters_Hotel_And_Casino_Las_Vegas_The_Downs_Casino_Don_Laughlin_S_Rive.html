<p>The gambling sector in the UK continues to increase the money spent on incentives for MPs, raising eyebrows and concerns about its impact on politics</p>
<p>For years the gambling sector in the UK has been spending money on different incentives for MPs in the country. Such incentives usually include tickets to popular games, as well as corporate hospitality. Some of the biggest gambling operators in the country have spent thousands of pounds on such incentives. But now, a new report leased by The Guardian reveals that the amount spent by the gambling sector for the MPs in the last five years has increased exponentially.</p>
<p>Citing public parliamentary records, the publication noted that dozens of Conservative and Labour MPs have benefitted from thousands of pounds from the leading players within the gambling vertical over the last few years. In detail, back in 2019, lobbyists and gambling companies spent close to £8,000 ($10,000) to pay for tickets for different events for six MPs, as well as their families and friends.</p>
<p>The amount spent on such incentives skyrocketed in 2021, with gambling companies and lobbyists spending some £114,000 ($142,000) for 25 MPs. A breakdown of the sum showed that most of it were spent on tickets for sports and music events, as well as corporate hospitality for MPs.</p>
<p>After that, in 2022, the number of MPs receiving such hospitality and incentives increased to 36. Overall, last year, the industry spent some £87,000 ($108,200) on tickets for sports and other entertainment events. The new report reveals that for 2023, so far, the gambling sector has spent some £13,000 ($16,200).</p>
<p>Still, it’s important to mention that those are the officially reported sums and the actual total may be significantly higher. This is because MPs aren’t obligated to declare tickets or hospitality less than £300 ($373).</p>
<p>Maintaining the Status Quo</p>
<p>The recent report comes at a time when a Conservative MP reportedly faces an investigation over a gambling lobbying scandal. Earlier this week, The Times released a report along with a video of Scott Benton MP, who allegedly offered to lobby for a gambling company, but actually met with undercover reporters. Benton was stripped from the Tory party whip in light of the recent report.</p>
<p>According to the Labour MP for Swansea East, Carolyn Harris, the gambling sector in the UK increases spending for incentives for MPs over fears of strict regulation. She said: “They do this because they’re terrified of regulation. They have grown beyond even their own expectations, but it’s an industry where 10% of the customers make 60% of the profits.” Harris noted that in order to maintain the status quo and “protect what they have,” the gambling sector is increasing the money it spends on lobbying.</p>
