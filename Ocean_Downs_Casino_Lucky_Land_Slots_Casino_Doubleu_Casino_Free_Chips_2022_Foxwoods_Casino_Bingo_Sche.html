<p>Hello Fayzer,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely acknowledge your concerns. From the information you've provided, it seems there might be some crucial details missing.</p>
<p>To clarify, the country you're playing from is on our list of restricted territories for using ROLR's services. This is clearly outlined in our Terms of Service. We also highlight the measures in place for players who, despite these restrictions, find a way to access and utilize our services from such regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, you mentioned that you "Had some lucky bets and got 800 usdt". However, it's clear that betting the entire deposited amount on the initial roulette spin is an uncommon practice among casual players but is a behavior often associated with those employing the opposite betting strategy, a strategy we believe you are well acquainted with. Our responsible department, in conjunction with a representative from Pragmatic Play, meticulously reviewed your wagers. It appears that multiple accounts, including yours, originating from the same IP address, engaged in numerous opposite bets during the same roulette rounds you participated in. Regrettably, this marks the third instance of a violation of our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>ROLR stands as a pinnacle among private casinos worldwide. We typically do not require document verification for 99% of our players; however, in cases of fraudulent activity, we reserve the right to suspend your account. Such deceptive practices not only harm the integrity of our casino but also undermine the enjoyment of other players. We remain unwavering in our commitment to preserving ROLR as a sanctuary for players, no matter the challenges we face.</p>
<p>We understand that this experience may not have been enjoyable for you, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused. We highly value your decision to bring this matter to public attention, and we'd like to clarify a few key points for anyone reading this complain.</p>
<p>ROLR is the World's Private Casino, and we do not require the need for KYC verification. However, it's essential to emphasize that we have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of fraud or misconduct.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>ROLR Team</p>
