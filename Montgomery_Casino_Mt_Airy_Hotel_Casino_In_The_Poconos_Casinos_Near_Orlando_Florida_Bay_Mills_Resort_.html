    <h1>Montgomery Casino Mt Airy Hotel Casino In The Poconos Casinos Near Orlando Florida Bay Mills Resort</h1>

<p>One of the biggest names in the Twitch streaming community, Herschel “Guy” Beahm, or DrDisrespect as his online handle goes, has been suspended permanently from the platform. No official reason has been given as of now.</p>
<p>Twitch Suspends DrDisrespect’s Account Permanently</p>
<p>DrDisrespect’s channel has become the latest account to receive a permanent ban from streaming giant Twitch. On June 26, the Streamer Bans Twitter account posted an update, confirming that as of 8 pm GMT, DrDisrespect would no longer be able to use the services of the streaming platform.</p>
<p>“Twitch Partner DrDisrespect has been banned”, the succinct statement read, which marked the increasingly hardline stance Twitch has been adopting of late to clamp down on users and creators who break the community guidelines, with some specificity to racism and sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>look: for several hours now I have been told from credible sources the reason DrDisrespect has been banned. however due to the importance and sensitivity around the subject I have refrained from going on it. i don't feel comfortable with it currently — Rod Breslau (@Slasher) June 27, 2020</p>
<p>DrDisrespect’s ban was quickly connected to a part of a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown. The news [about the ban] was confirmed by Rod Slasher, an industry insider, shocking many as DrDisrespect had just signed an exclusivity partnership with Twitch earlier this year.</p>
<p>In a statement to Polygon, a respected esports, gaming, and tech publication, Twitch simply stated that the company was in its right to “take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community.”</p>
<p>However, Slasher has tweeted that it hasn’t got to do with DMCA, with the reasons now doubly peculiar to the community.</p>
<p>All DrDisrespect’s followers have been refunded by the platform and any existing partnership between him and third parties has been nixed. With the lack of comment from DrDisrespect, many have speculated about the likely reasons for the ban, suggesting anything from tax fraud to money laundering.</p>
<p>However, these rumors have neither been confirmed nor has Herschel “Guy” Beahm, Doc’s real name, commented on what had led to this outcome.</p>
<p>Twitch’s March Against Racism and Sexual Misconduct</p>
<p>With the latest suspension of one of the best-known faces of online streaming, Twitch is sending an unequivocal message – no matter how big you are, your actions have consequences.</p>
<p>Recently, the platform has been involved in a spate of sexual misconduct claims levied by mostly female victims at content creators and other personalities from the community. Many previously respected and well-thought-of individuals have fallen from grace over seedy acts, including Brad “BlessRNG” Jolly who was accused of sexual misconduct, which he acknowledged publicly and apologized for, although trying to shift part of the blame on the victim.</p>
<p>Previously, Toby “TobiWan” Dawson was accused by several women of inappropriate behavior and forcing a carnal relationship on some of the victims. Similar to BlessRNG, TobiWan has been ostracized from the community.</p>
<p>syndereN, another famous Dota 2 caster and a hitherto considered close friend to TobiWan, has publicly severed all ties with him, not least because Meruna, one of TobiWan’s reported victims, is in a long-term relationship with syndereN today.</p>
<p>For all purposes, video games and esports are having a #MeToo moment, and for the nonce, tax fraud may look like the better reason for DrDisrespect’s suspension.</p>
