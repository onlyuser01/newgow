    <h1>Adrenaline Casino Casino In Lincoln Ca Casino Pizza Limitless Casino No Deposit Bonus Hard Rock Casi</h1>

<p>While my account was in the red, vave was withdrawing money without any problems. At the moment I had $27,500 deposited on my account and not a single withdrawal. Of course they won't ask me for any documents as long as I bring them my money.</p>
<p>After 10-12 days, I started to break away and increase my balance and made a withdrawal of $12,500 without problems (the account was still in the red by $15k). The second withdrawal also went without problems. I ordered another $12,000 for withdrawal a week after the first withdrawal. The account was still negative, which is probably why the withdrawal went quickly and without problems.</p>
<p>But 2 days ago, the bets started winning one by one and the account balance became $18,000 (if you count the account balance, it turns out that my balance is in positive territory by $1,500 for 3 weeks of my account life).</p>
<p>On the third withdrawal of $10,500, vave was asked for verification. I am a resident of Russia, so I have a Russian Federation passport. But who would have thought that vave are so arrogant and can impose sanctions on sports betting for only one country. And it naturally turned out to be Russia. I registered on August 1st and there was no clause in their terms-and-conditions that players from Russia cannot bet on sports, I am more than sure of this.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is that the site supports 19 different languages, respectively, the section "Terms and Conditions" is translated into all available 19 languages. And Clause 2.1. in "Terms and Conditions", where it says about the ban on players from Russia is only on the English version of the site. No other language has this item.</p>
<p>I sent photos within 40 minutes of the verification request and received a response after 80 minutes. That is, verification was fast. As a result, the balance was $18,000, of which $15,000 was confiscated by vave, and $3,000 was given to me (apparently as a gesture of goodwill). This is nothing short of racist and making up rules on the fly. Because banning players from a single country from betting on sports is blatant discrimination.</p>
<p>They confirmed to me by email that they introduced a clause about Russian players less than a month ago.</p>
