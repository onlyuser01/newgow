<p>Sportradar has penned a multi-year agreement with the sports betting platform, The Action Network, to become an official provider of sports data and content for the media company.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the US-based Action Network will be able to leverage sports data services from the content solutions provider Sportradar to power up its premium subscription product, Action Edge, with the purpose to enhance the mobile experience for its clients in regards to tracking scores and stats in real-time.</p>
<p>2020 Promises To Be Busy From The Start</p>
<p>The new sports data partnership deal is the third for Sportradar since the beginning of the year, as the company is looking to firm up its place as a global leader in providing sports data services.</p>
<p>In January, the Swiss-based Sportradar signed a deal with INTRALOT Inc, a subsidiary of INTRALOT Group in the USA, for all of its pre-match and live data requirements, including the official data feeds from all major US leagues, and in turn, INTRALOT will supply this data to lotteries in Washington DC, Montana, New Hampshire and New Mexico.</p>
<p>In February, the new professional football league, the XFL, followed the example set forth by the NFL in August 2019 and went into a media partnership deal with Sportradar, along the terms of which the data company will offer a play-by-play data feed specifically designed for websites, apps and digital platforms like fantasy sports to enable XFL fans and partners quick access to game statistics and league information.</p>
<p>Betting Data Needs Betting Media To Flow</p>
<p>The deal between Sportradar and The Action Network will allow the American-based sports media company to deliver a variety of data-based insights to its customers, supported by the creative dynamic content by the sports data provider.</p>
<p>“Sportradar, like The Action Network, sits at the center of sports, media and betting. As such, we are always looking to align ourselves with like-minded brands that understand the shifting nature of the fan experience and how to create engaging, bespoke products for sports fans. We are excited to work with The Action Network to fully unlock the potential of its growing audience” Dave Abbott, Managing Director, Sportradar</p>
<p>The Action Network that is mainly focused on sports betting analysis already covers several sports, including the NBA and NFL, some college sports, horse racing and tennis.</p>
<p>“Sportradar’s seamless real-time data offering will allow us to do what we do best, which is serve our audience through our best in class app and memberships. Sportradar will help us efficiently scale the sports that we support, bringing more unique data and information to the consumer” Matt Restivo, Chief Product Officer, The Action Network</p>
<p>In November 2019, The Action Network received $17.5 million investment from RSE Ventures, the private investment firm of the owner of Miami Dolphins, Steven Ross.</p>
