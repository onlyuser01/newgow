<p>Up until recently, Belgium was sitting in the no.1 place in the FIFA World Rankings, which explains just how strong this team is. It also explains why Belgium is seen as a huge favorite against Canada on Wednesday. Roberto Martinez’s boys are priced at -200, but the odds were even shorter only a few days ago.</p>
<p>The reason behind the odds move is that the bettors have realized the CanMNT is a force to be reckoned with. We all know the Canadians can be very good on the pitch, but will they be good enough on Wednesday to snatch a point(s) off Belgium?</p>

<p>Belgium Might be a Dream Team Past Its Prime</p>
<p>One may argue that the Belgium national soccer team has more superstars on the roster than any other team competing in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Real Madrid’s forward Eden Hazard is their captain.</p>
<p>The vice-captain is Jan Vertonghen, an ex-Tottenham player who’s now playing for Anderlecht. The third captain is Manchester City’s midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who’s widely considered the best playmaker on the planet. Further, the man between the posts is Thibaut Courtois, the recipient of the 2022 Lav Yashin Trophy – the award for the best goalkeeper in the world.</p>
<p>The trouble is that all of these guys are over 30. In fact, Belgium’s projected starting XI against Qatar has seven players who are above 30. The other four aren’t much younger either. Romelu Lukaku, for instance, is 29.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, one may assume that Belgium players are past their prime. They might be, but they do have the experience needed to do well in big tournaments. That said, we expect them to do very well against Canada.</p>
<p>Canada’s Squad is a Combination of Youth and Experience</p>
<p>Canada’s captain Atiba Hutchinson is turning 40 in February. However, he’s got plenty of younger teammates who are expected to do all the hard work.</p>
<p>The best example is Canada’s biggest star Alphonso Davies, whose job in Qatar will be to cover the entire left side of the pitch. In Bayern, his role is the left-back, but with the CanMNT, his more of an attacking-minded winger.</p>
<p>Jonathan David is another player whose job is going to be to create goal chances, and the same goes for Canada’s all-time top scorer, Cyle Larin. With these guys in the top three, Canada does stand a good chance of scoring against Belgium. The big question is whether the CanMNT can outscore the Red Devils?</p>
<p>Belgium vs Canada Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be one high-scoring affair as both teams are great in the offence. Belgium will be the team in possession of the ball for most of the match, but we’re certain Canada will create plenty of chances via counter-attacks.</p>
<p>Some of those might get in! Still, we do think it’s very unlikely the CanMNT will score enough to get anything out of this game.</p>
<p>Picks: Belgium to win and over 2.5 goals</p>
