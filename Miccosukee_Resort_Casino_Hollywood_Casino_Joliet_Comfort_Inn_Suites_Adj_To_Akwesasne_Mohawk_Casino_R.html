<p>Pariplay has added more games to its Fusion platform by tapping Green Jade Games products. Pariplay, which focuses on the development, aggregation, and content distribution of iGaming products, has turned to Green Jade Games to strengthen its present lineup of titles and products and create fresh opportunities for players who seek to experience new games.</p>
<p>Green Jade Games Adds Arcade Products to Fusion Platform</p>
<p>Pariplay’s push toward adding more titles has been tireless and the latest partnership focuses exclusively on arcade games that are developed by Green Jade Games. The first titles that will hit Pariplay’s aggregator shelves include Casino Blocks, Candy Prize B.I.G., and Cash Smash.</p>
<p>Green Jade Games has been a multi-faceted developer who has specialized in various aspects of the iGaming experience. While the arcades are a signature move for the company, it has been equally well-represented in traditional slot space. As a result, the company is signing up a similar partnership with Pariplay’s Ignite platform.</p>
<p>Green Jade will now make its offer available to US operators with the Fusion platform already providing thousands of possible choices. Pariplay director of partnerships Collum Harris welcomed Green Jade’s addition and congratulated the company’s established track record for creating slick and compelling arcade games.</p>
<p>Executives Happy with North American Gaming Opportunities</p>
<p>He said that it was great to have the company on board and able to distribute titles across the US with the Fusion option:</p>
<p>The unique offering is set to grow over the coming months and years and it’s a privilege to be aligned on a growth journey as iGaming continues to roll out across the country. Pariplay director of partnerships Collum Harris</p>
<p>Green Jade Games CCO Mark Taffler was similarly pleased with the opportunity, arguing that Green Jade Games will be able to bring its innovative and entertaining content to even more consumers across the US with the Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Taffler confirmed that Green Jade Games is happy to continue growing and scaling across the United States and North American regions.</p>
