<p>Livespins has been an innovator in the way players enjoy slots and experience online casinos in general. To maintain its claim as one of the biggest innovators in the industry, the company is now bringing more talent to help drive sales. As a result, Livespins has appointed MarkoErakovic as its new Sales Director who will assist the firm in scaling its offer and reaching new operators and their audiences.</p>
<p>Livespins is a unique gaming vertical that has been developed as a concept to make casino streaming more entertaining. Essentially, players can watch streamers play in real time and place bets side by side. The added bonus is that a player need not match the bet that is being placed by the streamer and can pick the pace of play themselves.</p>
<p>Erakovic will be in a good position to leverage this unique proposition and expand it with new partners, cultivating relationships and establishing partnerships in the process. He himself is a well-seasoned industry veteran with more than 20 years of experience which means that Livespins has also made a good choice in bringing him in.</p>
<p>Erakovic’s role will be even more important as he will be tasked with shaping the future of the company, Livespins said in the official press statement. Commenting on the new addition, Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen spoke highly of his appointment, and praised his passion and industry expertise.</p>
<p>Erakovic similarly brings a network of connections that would undoubtedly benefit Livespins’ further growth and opportunities. He will also make a very good argument as to why operators may consider leveraging Livespins’content which is designed to strike home with otherwise hard-to-reach player bases.</p>
<p>"I am delighted to welcome him to the team and to work closely with him as momentum continues to build behind Livespins and we join forces with more forward-thinking operators, suppliers and steamers across the globe," Pedersen concluded.</p>
<p>Erakovic welcomed his appointment and the chance to be a part of one of the most transformative companies in the iGaming industry as a whole. He hailed the original concept coined by the company in delivering strong live entertainment experiences and said that he was excited to bring his passion and help the company identify new opportunities and further develop its market presence.</p>
<p>Livespins recently teamed up with REEVO, a content aggregator and developer of original slot games itself.</p>
