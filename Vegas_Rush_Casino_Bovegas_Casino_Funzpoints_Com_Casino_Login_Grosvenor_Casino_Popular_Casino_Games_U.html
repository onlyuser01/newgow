<p>I know the withdrawal is low so no chance of winning big but as I self excluded for 5yrs on Gamstop I have tried different non Gamstop casinos that have Finn and this casino plays the best for me. You might say that it shouldn’t make any difference because the casino just host the casinos from the providers but in my experience it does. Also in my experience in playing Finn is that you generally can’t win more than €700 before it goes into dead spins mode but it does it should be a RNG so really shouldn’t happen but it does this comes from 5yrs of playing it. Of course if you play with high stakes like €10 a spin you would obviously win more but I generally deposit €30/50 start small and increase the amount if it plays well. I would not gamble at all on slots if it wasn’t for the buzz I get from playing Finn.</p>
<p>have a good day</p>
