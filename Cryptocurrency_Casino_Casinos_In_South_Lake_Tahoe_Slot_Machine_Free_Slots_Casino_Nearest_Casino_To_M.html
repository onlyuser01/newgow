<p>Arsenal come into Game 1 of the Europa League after EPL 4/5 losses at home</p>
<p>Valencia have not lost a single game in the competition yet</p>
<p>Arsenal have an advantage playing on home turf</p>
<p>The Europa League semifinal is almost upon us with the May 2, Thursday game between Valencia and Arsenal piquing interest of football fans around the world. Arsenal will be welcoming the Spanish team back home in London, which is a relief given the Gunners’ poor away performance this year.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Valencia Europa League Semifinal: Predictions and Overview</p>
<p>Starting off on home turf at the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal are looking good in the Semifinals of Europa League against Valencia. The Gunners have a more conservative play style which, some have argued, makes them a little more boring watch to playing.</p>
<p>However, Arsenal have been faced with strong headwinds back home in the English Premier League (EPL), losing four out of their five last matches, a poor performance, especially when it was in the face of teams, such as Crystal Palace, Wolves and Leicester.</p>
<p>Valencia are caught on another competitive front, trying to climb up the leaderboard at home. Marcelino García Toral’s are also trying to balance between a spot in the Champions League and keep their spot in next year’s round of Europa League.</p>
<p>Date: Thursday, May 2</p>
<p>Thursday, May 2 Time: 3 PM ET, 8 PM BST</p>

<p>Arsenal are also battling it out home, hoping to land a spot in Champions League, but they have faced stiff opposition from the likes of Chelsea and Tottenham.</p>
<p>Both Valencia and Arsenal have their weaknesses and both teams have a lot at stake</p>

<p>Arsenal Looking Good Past the Group Stage</p>
<p>While the signs at home have been worrying, Arsenal is still very much a primed favorite for the upcoming game. The Gunners successfully won five games, drew one and dominated in the knockout stages for an aggregate of 8-0 – quite the stats.</p>
<p>Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have been doing an amazing job at keeping their team in the game, and there seems to be little that can stem the attacks of Arsenal with Valencia pressed on all fronts.</p>
<p>Valencia’s Francis Coquelin Not to Attend</p>
<p>Valencia are missing an important midfielder in the face of Francis Coquelin who has been suspended and will miss the first game of the competition. However, Valencia have a lot to feel confident about.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Valencia – Europa League Arsenal Valencia 9/12 Wins 5/6 1 Draws 1 2 Losses 0 22 Goals 11 150 Total Attempts 47 85% Passing accuracy 84% 57% Possession 46%</p>
<p>They have dominated in 22 games before finally being handed their first defeat at the hands of Atletico Madrid. With footballers such as Dani Parejo and Gabriel Paulista, a former Arsenal player himself, Los Che seem to be in good form and all ready to challenge the Gunners.</p>
<p>Valencia is celebrating its 100th anniversary, and winning their first game against Arsenal is quite the way to mark the hundred-year history of the club. True, the club has had less time to cut their teeth on in the competition, but they are looking strong nevertheless.</p>
