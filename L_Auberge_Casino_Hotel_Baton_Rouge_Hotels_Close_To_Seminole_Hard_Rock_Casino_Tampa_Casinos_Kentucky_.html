<p>Kindred and MuchBetter Ink a New Global Payment Partnership</p>
<p>The award-winning payments company, MuchBetter, announced on Tuesday that it inked a new global payments partnership with Kindred Group. Under the agreement, all Kindred brands will gain access to the company’s payment app. The first brands to access the payment app will be Maria Casino, Unibet, and Bingo.com.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why Kindred picked MuchBetter is the low transaction rates which the company offers. Furthermore, the global payments company also offers a customizable e-wallet, which is suitable for the needs of iGaming players. Last but not least, Kindred chose MuchBetter hoping that the payments company will help navigate through the complex regulatory requirements in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Kindred Remains Committed to Offering Players Safer Ways for Gambling</p>
<p>In a statement, Kindred Group’s senior payments solutions manager, Phaedra Debattista, said that the company is committed to offering players safer ways for gambling. Furthermore, she added that Kindred listened to its players and chose MuchBetter as its new payment partner.</p>
