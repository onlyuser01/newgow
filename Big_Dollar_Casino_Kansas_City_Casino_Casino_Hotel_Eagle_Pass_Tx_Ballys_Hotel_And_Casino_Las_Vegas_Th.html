<p>To revive the Codere SA heritage Spanish gambling group, a new board has been established. A statement by Nueva Codere, the business identity of Codere owned by bondholders, confirmed that Christopher Bell was approved to be the non-executive chair of the company.</p>
<p>Last January, Bell's name was submitted as a possible candidate. The former CEO of Ladbrokes Plc and NED of Rank Entertainment and XL Media was seen as the perfect leader to take Codere in a new direction.</p>
<p>Bell was approved by bondholders to lead Codere's new eight-member board of directors. He is joined by Vicente di Loreto, the group's former CEO, who will continue to hold a seat on Nueva Codere's board. He also continues his corporate governance duties that he has been performing since January 2018.</p>
<p>Bondholders were informed by Aidan de Brunner, former Morgan Stanley executive director, that he had accepted the position of Class-A independent advisor to the board. Antonio Moya-Angeler, the former Managing Director for Advent International's South American PE Fund, will continue to serve as qualified shareholder director.</p>
<p>The remaining seats on Nueva Codere's board will now be filled by 'Class B' advisors, including Laurence Biver, Isabelle Lambert, Mathieu Kala, Sandra Egan and Mathieu Kakal.</p>
<p>The board will be responsible for developing a 2022-2026 business plan for Codere. This plan will aim to return the gambling group to its pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Closing trading in 2021, bondholders ended the embattled firm's listing on Madrid Bolsa, the Spanish stock exchange. Debtors agreed to a split of the assets of the Spanish gambling company.</p>
<p>According to reports, bondholders want a complete breakup of Codere assets starting with its loss-marking Argentine unit. Following the sale of those assets, additional Latin American assets could be offered, as well.</p>
<p>Chris Bell stated that Nueva Codere is a company with a bright future. He added that he is positive about the new phase of the company's existence because of the experience and capacity of the management team.</p>
