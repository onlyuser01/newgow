<p>Dallas Mavericks or Phoenix Suns – who’s going to the West Conference Final? We’ll find out the answer on Sunday at Footprint Center in Phoenix, where the two foes clash in the seventh game of the series. The series is tied 3-3, meaning that whoever wins on Sunday will advance further.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think it’s going to be Phoenix. No surprise there as this team was phenomenal in the regular season, finishing at the top of the Western Conference table with a 64-18 record. Meanwhile, Dallas finished three spots below with a 52-30 record.</p>
<p>Another thing going in the favor of the Suns is that the decisive game is played on their turf, which is where this team has all wins against the Mavericks in the 2022 Playoffs. In fact, the Suns have won each of the previous eight duels with the Mavericks played at Footprint Center.</p>
<p>Still, Dallas does have one ace up its sleeve – Luka Doncic. The 23-year-old Slovenian forward was his team’s top scorer in each of the six games against Phoenix.</p>

<p>Can Doncic &amp; Co. Cause a Sensation?</p>
<p>March 22, 2022, was when Doncic scored under 20 points the last time. Since then, we saw him put away over 20 points (24 or more, to be precise) in 18 games. He was Dallas’ scoring leader in each of the six games against Phoenix, one of which saw him score 45 points.</p>
<p>Apart from scoring, Doncic has also been great in terms of assists and rebounds. In their previous game – which Dallas won 113-86 at home – Doncic scored 33 points, while also making 11 rebounds and eight assists.</p>
<p>Doncic was superb in the offense, while his teammates were more focused on the defense. It worked – they were able to hold the Suns to just 86 points. That’s the least number of points this team’s scored in more than a year.</p>
<p>The Suns Home Court Advantage</p>
<p>Footprint Center is Phoenix’s fortress. This is the place where this team is without a loss in four previous games, three of which were against the Mavs. Not only did the Suns win each of those games, but they did it in style. In fact, their most recent game played in Phoenix saw the Suns destroy the Mavericks 110-80.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think they’re going to win again, making the Suns a 7.5-point favorite. It may seem strange, but this team definitely has the manpower to pull it off. Devin Booker is their best player this season, but unlike Dallas, Phoenix is not a one-man army.</p>
<p>These guys are great in all aspects of the game, including defense. That’s the aspect they will have to focus on this Sunday if they wish to stop Doncic.</p>
<p>Dallas Mavericks vs Phoenix Suns Prediction</p>
<p>It seems that the fate of the Dallas Mavericks vs Phoenix Suns Game 7 is in the hands of Luka Doncic. If he puts the same level of performance as he did in their previous game, the Mavericks will win.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not just up to Doncic; it’s also up to the Suns and their ability to stop Dallas’ superstar. So far, they haven’t been able to do so, which is why backing the visitors might not be a bad betting option.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Mavericks +7.5</p>
