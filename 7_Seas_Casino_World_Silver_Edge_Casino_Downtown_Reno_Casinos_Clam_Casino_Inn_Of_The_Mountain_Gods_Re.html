    <h1>7 Seas Casino World Silver Edge Casino Downtown Reno Casinos Clam Casino Inn Of The Mountain Gods Re</h1>

<p>Provider of innovative iGaming titles and content Wazdan has strengthened its relationship with the Swiss market and teamed up with the Swiss-facing operator Casinò Lugano. The company has now launched its products on the land-based operator’s digital brand, Swiss4Win, bringing its full portfolio of acclaimed games to the website.</p>
<p>Swiss4Win Welcomes Wazdan’s Highly Intuitive Titles</p>
<p>The games that will now be available to consumers include player-favorite titles such as Power of Gods: Hades, Sun of Fortune, 9 Lions, and Hold the Jackpot titles. Players at Swiss4Win will have the opportunity to benefit from the dedicated Player Engagement Suite deployed by Wazdan on top of the game portfolio already available on the platform.</p>
<p>This suite allows players to adjust the Volatility Levels, benefit from Cash Drop promotions, and experience many new innovative in-game features. There is even a dedicated Cash Back promotion that involves Wazdan titles. Wazdan has been building up on its partnership in Europe.</p>
<p>The brand has been able to team up with a number of companies, including Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino, BetOlimp, PressEnter Group, and SoccerBet. The partnership was welcomed by Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla who said:</p>
<p>We are thrilled to have taken a selection of our renowned titles live with Casinò Lugano and its online brand Swiss4Win. Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla</p>
<p>Hyla confirmed that the company was confident in its ability to grow in the Swiss market and deliver spot-on content to Swiss players on the go. Wazdan also brings a range of personalization tools to make the experience even more worthwhile, the CCO assured.</p>
<p>Similarly, Casinò Lugano board member and CEO Paolo Sanvido felt confident about the success of the new products in Switzerland. He added that the casino had a successful track record of teaming up with companies that resonate with local player audiences.</p>
<p>Wazdan Grows Presence in the Swiss Market</p>
<p>“For this reason, we are delighted to have partnered with Wazdan, and look forward to enjoying the benefits of the collaboration,” the executive added. Wazdan has been building a strong presence in the Swiss gambling market, which relies exclusively on domestic brands for the operation of the iGaming vertical. Earlier this month, Wazdan teamed up with Jackpots.ch, another respected local online gambling operator.</p>
