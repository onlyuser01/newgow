<p>The foray into Greece represents a major development for BF Games, which has been looking to expand in Europe and North America</p>
<p>BF Games, a modern studio creating premium online casino gaming software, has expanded its European footprint thanks to a new agreement. The company teamed up with the Greek operator Novibet, allowing it to make a foray into Greece.</p>
<p>Under its deal with the local operator, BF Games will power Novibet’s content offering with its diverse portfolio of gaming content. As agreed, the supplier will power Novibet with hit slot games such as Chicken Madness, Cave of Gold, Buffalo Trail and Burning Slots.</p>
<p>As a result, Greek players will be able to access tons of new content, which will boost their loyalty to Novibet and improve their overall experience. Greece also represents an exciting opportunity for BG Games, which will be able to augment its presence in the continent.</p>
<p>BF Games’ portfolio of best-in-class slots currently included more than 70 unique games. The company is known for developing classic slot games, as well as innovative titles with market-leading mechanics.</p>
<p>The company is bullish on consolidating its footprint in Europe and North America. A few days ago, it managed to secure a license from the ACGO and will launch in the Canadian province of Ontario.</p>
<p>A Huge Opportunity for BF Games</p>
<p>Claudia Melcaru, BF Games’ head of business development, commented on the foray into the Greek market. She said that entering Greece represents a major opportunity for her company. Melcaru described the entry as a “key development for BF Games,” which continues to expand its global footprint in efforts to reach more audiences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, launching with Novibet, which is a leading operator in Greece, will help put BF Games in a great position to truly leave a mark.</p>
<p>Launching with Novibet, a prominent operator in the country, puts us in the best possible position as we look to quickly make a mark and establish ourselves in this exciting marketplace. Claudia Melcaru, head of business development, BF Games</p>
<p>Novibet is a major Greek operator that offers online casino games and sports betting. The company holds a leadership position in its home market but its products are also available in foreign regulated jurisdictions. In November, for example, Novibet penned a Mexico-facing agreement with Big Bola.</p>
<p>Entering Greece is a great opportunity for BF Games as it is one of the most flourishing European markets. According to the local regulator, Greek gaming surpassed a revenue of $748 million in 2021.</p>
