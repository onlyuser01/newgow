    <h1>Harrahs Casino Murphy Nc Lucky Legends Casino Winstar Casino In Thackerville Ok Double U Casino Buff</h1>

<p>Thank you, Tobiasslimy, for your game history. I have checked it thoroughly but unfortunately, couldn't find any signs of RTP being manipulated.</p>
<p>Return to player(RTP) ratio, also called payout ratio is a number that describes what percentage of each bet is statistically returned to a player from each bet (it is not saying what percentage of deposits the player will get back as some people may think). So if someone wagers 1000$ on a game with 90% RTP his expected return is 900. There are some facts about RTP that we would like to highlight.</p>
<p>First of all, this expected return is just a mathematical average. In short, anyone can get very lucky (or unlucky) and get a much bigger (or lesser) return than his expectation. However, if you play for a long time, your real return will be close to the expected return. In mathematics, this is called the law of big numbers. Many people wrongly believe that this means that if someone was very unlucky during some time period that he should get very lucky over the next period of time. Or that if the red number won on roulette ten times in a row, there is a bigger chance that the black one will win next. This is called Gambler's fallacy and it's not true.</p>
<p>Past results have no influence on future results. The law of big numbers is saying that if you get very unlucky in the past you can expect to get average results in the future (you would have the same expectation if you get good or average luck in the past - what happened in the past just doesn't matter in the present). And this average result will give you closer to the average result overall. For example, if red won on roulette 8 times of 10 in the first ten spins and then 5 times of 10 in the next ten spins, it's overall 13 times out of 20 which is much closer to theoretical expectation than 80% wins for red from first ten spins.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about RTP we recommend you watch our videos about this topic:</p>

<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but Iâ€™m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint as unjustified. I wish I could be of more help. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
