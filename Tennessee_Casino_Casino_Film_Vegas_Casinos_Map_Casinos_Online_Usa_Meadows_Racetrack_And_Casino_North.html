<p>Pinnacle esports has become the latest jersey and content sponsor to Danish esports company North.</p>
<p>Pinnacle and North Esports Sign 18-month Partnership</p>
<p>With esports set to grow significantly over the next decade, everyone seems to be investing in the segment, including betting agencies. Based in Copenhagen, Denmark, North Esports is the latest competitive video gaming company to team up with a sportsbook in the face of Pinnacle. The partnership is signed for a period of 18 months and it will come with exclusive digital content and Pinnacle’s logo appearing on the jerseys of North’s team members.</p>
<p>The partnership comes at a time when gambling in electronic sports is coming to the attention of developers and regulators. The UK Gambling Commission, the UK regulator, has noted an increase in underage gambling activities but has refused to argue that loot boxes, an item found in games, is similar to gambling.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce our partnership with @TheNorthIsHere!</p>
<p>The partnership will span 18 months, and will see the Pinnacle logo on the North jersey! 🎉</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Valve, the creators of two popular competitive products – Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, has appealed to competitive teams not to sign partnerships with betting agencies. This request has been largely ignored.</p>
<p>North Continues Line of Esports Betting Partnerships</p>
<p>Yet, North seems to be optimistic about the partnership. Here is what Jonas Gundersen, COO at the esports team and company, had to say:</p>
<p>“Partnering up with Pinnacle really is underlining the journey we are on with North. It feels great that we are able to continue the next phase of the journey together with such a well-respected and household name that shares our ambition of narrating the esports story as it develops. Our passion for gaming is very strong, and Pinnacle really understands our aim of expanding even further.”</p>
<p>North is not new to teaming up with betting agencies. Previously, the company was working with GG.BET, another prominent bookmaker, but the partnership has been dropped since in favor of Pinnacle.</p>

<p>Pinnacle also expressed satisfaction with the latest developments, arguing that the partnership was a major breakthrough for the company as well. Here is what the company’s trading director, Marco Blume had to say:</p>
<p>“This is a massive deal for us. We have waited so long for a team partnership because we wanted to make sure we signed with an organisation that matched our ambition and desire to take esports to the next level. “</p>
<p>Mr. Blume added that so far as esports teams went, North was one of the best possible partners the company could have signed up with, as it “ticked all the boxes”. Partnerships between esports teams and betting agencies are not exactly new.</p>
<p>Betway, a UK-headquartered operator, is one of the longest-term sponsors of Ninjas in Pyjamas, a famous Dota 2 and CS:GO squad. NIP and Betway recently extended their partnership.</p>
