<p>Dragon Gaming has released The Wicked Witches on time for the Halloween Holiday. The studio continues to roll out HTML5-friendly games introducing new features to iGaming.</p>
<p>The Wicked Witches by Dragon Gaming’s Here for Halloween</p>
<p>Dragon Gaming’s ‘The Wicked Witches’ is just on time for Halloween, providing players with a chilling experience for the spooky holiday. The medium-volatility video slot comes with a number of interesting features and a traditional 5-reel, 3-row layout.</p>
<p>Players can benefit from 27 fixed paylines as well as enjoy 96.03% as the average Return to Player (RTP) rate. However, the demo’s paytable clarifies that the more accurate return in the long term is closer to 95.82%.The slot has been developed to display well on any platform, including desktop, tablet, smartphone, iOS and Android, powered by the underpinning HTML5 technology.</p>
<p>Dragon Gaming has created a good value for players providing them with a $0.27 to $135 in terms of bet size. The maximum wining in the base game is capped at $85,050 whereas a feature game pushes this number to $300,000.</p>
<p>Making Halloween Wortwhile with ‘The Wicked Witches’</p>
<p>The title is stacked with several exciting features that will give the classic slot game a modern twist. There are player-tested and brand-new mechanics to sprinkle up the gameplay with a distinct feeling and introduce players to, as Dragon Gaming puts it, a world of magic.</p>
<p>The Wild Symbol is a traditional Jack-O-Lantern topping off a scarecrow bound to a pole. It’s every bit as eerie as you can expect. This spooky phantom may bring you a 7x multiplier in the best of cases, meaning a lot more profit than you have hoped for.</p>
<p>For the bonus game, which features up to 12 free spins, you have the cobweb-covered tombs that you would be surprisingly keen to pry open. Make sure you get at least three for the feature to activate.</p>
<p>Great Ambiance and More Multipliers</p>
<p>Next, you have the Expanding Wild Symbol to provide with a 3x multiplier depending on the combination they appear in. All of the above has been tested down to the last detail, giving players a unique visual and gameplay setting.</p>
<p>Players are welcome to a great ambiance. That includes bubbling cauldrons, vials of green goo all bottled up and graveyard-like scenery where the wicked witches clearly prefer to dwell. In fact, the witches are part of the experience and they play the role of the highest-paying symbols.</p>
<p>There are three of them to assist you in trick and treating the casinos you have chosen. Dragon Gaming’s portfolio of games continues to grow and expand. The Wicked Witches is just the latest option for keen casino players.</p>
<p>Next in the pipeline, Dragon Gaming has another 10-payline video slot coming with Buffalo Bounty on the cards.</p>
