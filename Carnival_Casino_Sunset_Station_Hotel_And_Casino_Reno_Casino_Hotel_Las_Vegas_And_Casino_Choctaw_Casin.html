    <h1>Carnival Casino Sunset Station Hotel And Casino Reno Casino Hotel Las Vegas And Casino Choctaw Casin</h1>

<p>Kambi Group, a leading business-to-business provider of sports betting services to licensed B2C gaming operators, has strengthened its commercial team with the addition of new chief commercial officers and three senior vice presidents.</p>
<p>Wachtmeister to Lead Kambi’s Commerce</p>
<p>The one stepping in as a CCO is the experienced Cecilia Wachtmeister, who has been working for the company for several years now. She joined the company as a director in 2017 and held the position until 2019 when she was chosen to serve as an executive vice president of business and group functions.</p>
<p>Wachtmeister is no stranger to commerce, having previously worked for some of the most esteemed companies in the world of telecommunications. She began her career in the Swedish company Ericsson where she held various positions between 1991 and 2001. After that, Wachtmeister quit the company to work for Clavister AB and then Sony Mobile Communications, before finally returning to Ericsson in 2007 for another decade-long term.</p>
<p>Three Distinguished Individuals Got Promoted to SVPs</p>
<p>As a part of Kambi Group’s refreshed commercial team, Wachtmeister will work together with three fresh additions, namely Jamie McKittrick, Sarah Robertson, and Veena Dhesi. Each of the latter has been promoted to a new vice-presidential role.</p>
<p>McKittrick is a veteran in the sports betting industry, boasting twenty years of experience in the sector. He has held positions in several of the big industry names, including the international gambling giant Entain. Under Kambi’s wing, McKittrick will work as SVP of commercial operations.</p>
<p>Robertson is another experienced individual, who is well-versed in the intricacies of the gambling market. She has held various positions at the B2B company Income Access between 2011 and 2018 and has since worked for Kambi. She will now rise as the latter company’s new SVP of sales.</p>
<p>Dhesi joined Kambi in 2021 but her savvy has already earned her a crucial promotion. As someone with significant experience in commerce, she will help Kambi improve its relationship with its partners and stakeholders, serving as SVP of partner success.</p>
<p>Wachtmeister Excited about 2022</p>
<p>Wachtmeister is excited to continue working for a company as successful as Kambi. She attributed the firm’s success to its market-leading product and partner-first focus. However, despite Kambi’s recent successes, Wachtmeister believes that the surface of what is possible has barely been scratched. She hopes to usher in a new age at Kambi and “capitalize on the many exciting opportunities that lay ahead.”</p>
<p>In January, Kambi inked an exclusive deal with MaximBet – an agreement that, according to Wachtmeister, is one of the main contributors to Kambi’s remarkable start of 2022. She is confident that there is a lot more that can be done before the end of the year.</p>
