<p>The Hand of Midas review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Hand of Midas is themed around the mythical king who turns anything he touches into gold.</p>
<p>Players will arrive in a majestic ancient scene filled with white pillars and enchantments. With his powerful touch, King Midas himself will help them navigate the mysteries of this world.</p>
<p>Lovers of Greek mythology may especially enjoy this game, but any player in the mood for a magical adventure will find what they are looking for.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The dramatic soundtrack brings to mind epic fantasy films, combining delicate tinkling notes and gusts of wind. The effect is haunting and will put players in a heroic state of mind.</p>
<p>The setting features towering marble pillars and eerie beams of green light, reinforcing the magical atmosphere. Sharp-eyed players will notice gold coins strewn on the ground and shimmers of glowing dust in the air.</p>
<p>On the reels, the most iconic symbol is King Midas, his face bearded and solemn. He wears an ornate crown accented with jewels.</p>
<p>The symbols include a chest of gold, an iconic golden hand, and King Midas’s daughter. She is entirely golden, reminding players of the story’s heartbreaking climax when Midas embraces his daughter and transforms her into a gold statue with his touch.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music create an engaging fantasy atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Hand of Midas is a five reel, three row slot with 20 win lines.</p>
<p>Players can opt into the Ante Bet feature, which changes the way the game behaves. For example, with a bet multiplier of x20, the gameplay is normal, but with a bet multiplier of x25, the chances of winning the Free Spins feature are naturally doubled, and more Scatter symbols appear on the reels.</p>
<p>The maximum win is x5,000 players’ total bet for both the base game and special features.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. Wild symbols land on reels 2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Wild symbols add a random multiplier whenever they land, and these can be added together if more than one Wild lands. The multipliers can be x1, x2, or x3.</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Scatters, the Free Spins feature is triggered.</p>
<p>Prior to the feature beginning, players are presented with 3 mini reels for each Scatter that triggered the feature. Each of these mini reels contains the option of 1, 2, or 3 free spins. The mini reels then all spin and award a total number of free spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, a multiplier is applied to player's wins, and Wilds remain sticky throughout the feature.</p>
<p>Depending on the number of Scatters that triggered the feature, the minimum guaranteed win can be higher. For example, if 3 Scatters trigger the feature, the minimum win is 'x10 players’ total bet, but if 4 Scatters trigger the feature, the minimum win is x20. Finally, if 5 Scatters trigger the feature, the minimum win is x30 player's total bet.</p>
<p>If players have not reached the minimum win amount by the time the free spins have been completed, the feature is retriggered. There is no retrigger limit for this feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.54%, nicely above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility mythology-themed slot.</p>
