<p>Leading B2B provider of solutions, content, and services for the sports betting and gaming industry EveryMatrix announced today its sportsbook solution achieved a record turnover in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Performing Better Than Forecasted</p>
<p>OddsMatrix, the sports betting solution provided by EveryMatrix, registered a turnover of over €100 million ($133 million) per month of total bets in the fourth quarter to reach a significant milestone and affirm the company’s position as a B2B sports betting technology provider.</p>
<p>“This is a great accomplishment for us, and the numbers don’t lie! OddsMatrix is a great product, and it’s performing even better than we forecasted.” Ebbe Groes, Group CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>The exceptional performance was also due to the new functionalities EveryMatrix introduced to its sportsbook solution in 2021. That includes the BetBuilder feature that is currently available for wagers in seven sports with more to come and the Do It Yourself option that empowers operators to come up with their unique tournaments, events, and odds.</p>
<p>“Our product experienced exponential growth in the recent years, and the talented OddsMatrix team is constantly at work to improve and expand upon what we achieved so far with the product.” Ebbe Groes, Group CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Increased Customer Engagement</p>
<p>The final business quarter of 2021 also saw a significant increase in FIFA and Basketball sports simulations wagering, as OddsMatrix experienced growth in existing clients and engaged with new ones.</p>
<p>The solution is designed to provide everything sports betting operators need to support their day-to-day activities, expand business, and increase their profitability. EveryMatrix’s sportsbook solution utilizes modern front-end technology with sophisticated back-end functions to offer its customers customizability, support, and monitoring.</p>
<p>The announcement of the record turnover of bets placed via OddsMatrix followed on from the interim report EveryMatrix released mid-December that covered the company’s financial results for the first nine months of 2021.</p>
<p>The report that showed the group had generated an increase of 35% in profit year-over-year reported several client-led product releases, the return to normal for sports in the third quarter of 2021 and the releasing of continuous product upgrades with regards to sportsbook operations.</p>
<p>Outside of sports, EveryMatrix introduced a dedicated customer unit, Managed Services, in October to provide 360° support to the executive teams of its B2B clients. Offering its clients support from acquisition and retention marketing to product management and payment solutions, EveryMatrix’s Managed Services is looking to help them improve their performance and capitalize on industry opportunities.</p>
<p>In the last month of 2021, EveryMatrix launched into the Mexican iGaming market, powering the casino offering of Foliatti Casino, an online casino brand operated by land-based operator Foliatti Group.</p>
