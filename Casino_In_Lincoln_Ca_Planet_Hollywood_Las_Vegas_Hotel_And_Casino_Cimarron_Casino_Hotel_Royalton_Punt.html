<p>Kambi, a B2B provider of sports betting services, has extended its existing agreement with Rank Group, one of its most loyal partners. As a result, the former party will continue to leverage Kambi’s reliable sportsbook products and services.</p>
<p>Since 2016, Kambi has supplied Rank Group with a number of services, including tracking powered by artificial intelligence, a bet builder tool and a horse racing product.</p>
<p>Rank Group relies heavily on Kambi when it comes to sports betting, as attested by their long-standing partnership. In addition, Rank Group has launched three sports betting brands on the Kambi platform, including Grosvenor Sport, Enracha and the recently-launched Spanish sportsbook YoSports.</p>
<p>The agreement between Kambi and Rank Group comes two months after the former company extended its sportsbook partnership with LeoVegas, another big gambling and betting operator. Last month, the company also expanded in Brazil where it agreed to power the launch of Eyas Gaming’s Lance! Betting brand.</p>
<p>Rank Group Trusts Kambi When It Comes to Sports</p>
<p>Speaking of the extension of the partnership with Kambi, Rank Group’s director of sports, Tom Orton, said:</p>
<p>With Kambi’s support, we have driven 80% growth in our Grosvenor sportsbook revenues over the past 12 months and are excited about what this extended partnership has the capacity to deliver. Tom Orton, director of sports, Rank Group</p>
<p>Orton added that Rank Group aspires to be fans’ sportsbook operator of choice. He believes that the partnership with Kambi will turn this dream into a reality.</p>
<p>Kambi’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Kristian Nylén, also expressed his thoughts on the arrangement. He said that his team is “very proud” to have solidified its partnership with Rank Group. According to Nylén, Kambi is looking forward to providing the operator’s outstanding sports betting brands with sportsbook content and solutions.</p>
<p>One of the gaming industry’s leading operators, Rank has long been a valued Kambi partner and we look forward to empowering their sports betting ambitions in the years to come with our complete sportsbook. Kristian Nylén, co-founder &amp; CEO, Kambi Group</p>
<p>In other news, Kambi recently published its Q2 results, demonstrating a strong performance across many metrics. The period was described as “encouraging” by the company, which managed to sign multiple agreements with tier-one partners.</p>
<p>Two months ago, Kambi solidified its presence in Sweden by securing a B2B permit, in line with the newly-introduced Swedish regulations for B2B companies.</p>
