<p>Business-to-business betting platform Novusbet has entered into a new partnership with Oddin.gg, an esteemed provider of betting solutions for the competitive video gaming segment, or esports. As a result, Novusbet will benefit from Oddin’s advanced esports wagering solutions that will allow it to get a foothold in the rapidly expanding esports vertical.</p>
<p>Bringing More Esports to iGaming Brands</p>
<p>While the exact size of the esports betting market is undetermined, and most industry experts do not expect individual bet size to exceed what’s gambled on sports, the overall volume is constantly growing. According to Novusbet, there is a “large, mostly untapped” revenue that can still be derived from this space.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Novus will work with Oddin.gg’s iFrame esports betting solution which will enable the brand to deliver tailored offers to customers in Africa and Latin America, where the partnership will focus in the months to come.</p>
<p>Commenting on this collaboration, Novusbet operations manager Simone Suppa welcomed Oddin.gg and praised the platform for its position in the esports market which sets it apart from the competition:</p>
<p>“We are excited to be able to launch their iFrame for our clients, who will benefit from the innovation and advanced technology that Oddin.gg continues to bring to the esports space.” Novusbet operations manager Simone Suppa</p>
<p>As Oddin.gg and Novusbet still need to finalize the integration of the product, Novusbet expects to be ready to offer access to high-traffic competitive games such as Dota 2, League of Legends, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive within the next few months.</p>
<p>Odin.gg to Reach “Tens of Millions” of New Customers</p>
<p>Oddin.gg is optimistic about what integration with the platform means. According to Marek Suchar, managing director and co-founder at Oddin, the platform should be able to reach “tens of millions of potential new customers.”</p>
<p>Suchar’s prediction aligns with the general idea that while volume per bet may not be big in the esports betting space, the audience interested in such contests may catch up to or even exceed traditional sports betting. By one estimate, esports betting revenue should reach $13 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>Suchar argued that both companies have worked hard to make this partnership a possibility and will now seek to realize its potential. “We are thrilled to be able to count on this new partnership to extend our reach and look forward to a long and prosperous relationship,” Suchar concluded.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Oddin has been actively striking partnerships. The company teamed up with Altenar, an iGaming company that sought to expand into esports in mid-2021. Oddin also joined ESIC’s efforts in tackling corruption in esports last year.</p>
