    <h1>Agua Caliente Casino Cathedral City Casino Restaurant Nyc Casinos In Puerto Rico Casino Pittsburg On</h1>

<p>Hi Jaro</p>
<p>I love this casino, the games are great the graphics are phenomenal, the deposits and withdraws are perfect but the services are a catastrophe. The entire management team, needs to be thrown out. You have customer service agents that's close the chat in my face, you have a VIP host that blocked me on WhatsApp and Email, all this because I asked to speak to a senior manager as there is zero information about the management team on the website, and I'm afraid my complaints have not been escalated to senior management.</p>
<p>The reason why I'm writing this on casino guru is to try and get the attention of the general manager, the owner or the casino director of operations. I have submitted so many email requests and they have all been rejected. They say management do not deal with customers anymore, that's the excuse for a customer that's labelled VIP</p>
<p>I deposited hundreds of thousands in this casino. The service was perfect initially, I got contacted on WhatsApp and my VIP host was looking after me perfectly. Then out of knowhere, the VIP hosts asks me to send him tips, I found that to be odd as for my years of experience I've never been asked to tip a host on an online casino. Maybe land based but never online.</p>
<p>I thought the trend has been changing and this is a new norm, however as we all know, every player tips when they win. We never tip when we've had several consecutive months of bad sessions. Then the host changed his attitude completely with me and sent me to the normal customer service host. Because of this, when I ask for my rewards, I literally have to beg for them, when I ask for my cash back it's impossible to get it when requested and on time. And when i ask a question I continuously get trolled without a reply. Which casino cannot tell a customer how much they have lost? Anything you ask them they tell you to do it yourself, they have zero respect for VIPs, very unprofessional and unqualified employees. This will be the downfall of metaspins</p>
<p>For me the most important experience In any casino is not the winning or losing, but the actual customer service.</p>
<p>I will be so happy if the director of operations or GM will simply message me and say hello, I'm happy to share the areas of improvements but they don't listen at all.</p>
