<p>The NFL offshoot has introduced Genius Sports as its official partner that will help with betting data distribution and free-to-play products</p>
<p>The move is designed to further help enhance XFL’s prominence in sports life in the United States. Genius will be able to distribute official data from every league game and have exclusive rights to do so across its global network of media and betting partners.</p>
<p>XFL and Genius Sports Ready to Drive Fan Engagement and Revenue</p>
<p>This will enable sportsbooks to provide accurate data and betting options to customers for every XFL event, thus driving engagement and boosting overall fan satisfaction. XFL data will also be available to brands and advertisers with all the information managed intelligently by the Genius Marketing Suite, which is the company’s unifying engagement platform.</p>
<p>Genius Sports will move forward as a trusted partner for the XFL, helping the league to significantly expand its digital audience and also leading to better engagement opportunities with players. The company also built the XFL Pick’Em game which is available to fans for free and can be downloaded for them to engage and enjoy the experience even more.</p>
<p>The app contains all sorts of interesting activities, including bets on various games, players and teams, as part of the XFL. Genius Sports and XFL have seen the value of “gamifying the experience,” meaning that fans will be engaged in what transpires in the games and be tuning in to watch more often, while also growing in numbers.</p>
<p>Besides, for those who manage to climb the F2P weekly rank lists, the XFL and Genius Sports are planning to offer a number of excellent prizes, such as FL Shop gift cards, a trip to the 2023 XFL Championship Game, and a lot more. XFL chief business &amp; legal officer Wendy Bass has welcomed the opportunity to see the league grow its opportunities for fan engagement.</p>
<p>Bass hailed Genius Sports and said that it was a great partner and one that the XFL was happy to align itself. She further noted that Genius Sports has established itself as a leader in engaging with the next generation of fans.</p>
<p>Genius Sports EVP Sean Conroy was similarly pleased with the opportunity and emphasized its wider implications for the business as such. Having a robust data strategy, he noted, was a good way to drive new revenue opportunities and boost fan engagement. The XFL is a professional American football league which has been on and off for the past few decades.</p>
<p>The league was finally restored on January 25, 2018, but it soon faced a new existential threat brought about by the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The XFL managed to survive the shuttering of global sports events and has emerged doubly motivated to become a permanent fixture of the American betting and sports calendar.</p>
