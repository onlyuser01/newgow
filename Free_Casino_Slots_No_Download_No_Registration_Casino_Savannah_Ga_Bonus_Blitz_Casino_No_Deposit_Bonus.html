<p>"Hello Casino Guru</p>
<p>The 25th August i won totally â‚¬700. Because I know myself that I likely play with the winning money (which the casino probably hope for) I asked the day after (26 augusy) to freeze my account until the payment have been processed. I came into contact with "Robert" and he said he couldnt close it because he didnt knew exactly when they payment was proceeded. I then asked to close my account for one week, until the 2nd september and he agreed to this. And further I asked him to not let me open it again until the 2nd september, and he said he would put a note on my account about that.</p>
<p>On the 27th august I was casually browsing and saw some ads from Foggystar. I tried to log in, pretty sure I wasnt able because my account was closed but hey, a gambler have to try. I came in and discovered my account wasnt closed. I tried to contact them but they never responds during the weekends with no chat either (this was a saturday). I left it there, but I was well aware my account wasnt closed so I logged in again after some hours and totally spend about â‚¬300 on the casino during the weekend. I was frustrated and sad because I clearly asked them to close it but they didnt.</p>
<p>I contacted them on monday about refunding my money and a long email process was initiated. In the end, they "felt sorry" about my loss. Offered me a 100% deposit bonus to cover it up, and when I got more frustrated about that, they said It was my own responsibility and wouldnt refund me.</p>
<p>Sadly... I dont have the orginal chat conversation with Robert because I need to manually download the chat logs which I didnt do because I was certain it wouldnt be a problem. However, I have the mail conversations with the manager.</p>
<p>Please help me CG. ðŸ˜•</p>
