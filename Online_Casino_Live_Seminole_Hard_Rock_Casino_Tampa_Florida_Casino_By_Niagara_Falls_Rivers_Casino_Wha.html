    <h1>Online Casino Live Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Florida Casino By Niagara Falls Rivers Casino Wha</h1>

<p>"So now you are stating that historical data does not apply from 1969? So now you can not break this system you are trying to use any excuse to say now historical spins now do not apply?"</p>
<p>You've completely twisted what I said. I'm simply stating that, based on my observations, any data, even generated by a pseudorandom number generator, is suitable for testing.</p>
<p>"Simply you now can not break this winning 2 corner system but avoiding the statements that you have made to check any Roulette systems to win or lose."</p>
<p>The illustration I provided shows that the specified number of bets may not play out as intended because the number of non-occurrences can be significantly higher than planned.</p>
<p>"I have given you a paper chart to use. Not any software, this is another excuse you and using to avoid to say this system does wins every time with no losses. Casino will ban you with a paper chart? This is crazy."</p>
<p>I only mentioned that, according to the forum administration, the use of third-party software or any additional tools could lead to a casino ban. This is not my opinion, and I explicitly stated that I disagree with the forum administration's view. Strange accusations on your part, as if you didn't read what I wrote.</p>
<p>"I do not need any services which you are promoting and charging money for as I have Roulette Extreme and can code any software to test any Roulette system for free."</p>
<p>I'm not promoting anything; I just wanted to share the tools I use. I didn't ask for any money from you; you didn't even write me any letters. What are you talking about, and why are you making up things that didn't happen? If you find something useful, use it; it's your right. Just don't accuse me of things that never occurred.</p>
<p>"This 2 corner has not lost over 12 months in profit."</p>
<p>Good for you. But you initiated this discussion and asked questions. I expressed my opinion and showed the challenges you might face. It's not my fault that you don't want to acknowledge that. Wish you luck with your system. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>"You have shown your true colors. Charging for services on websites! Not helping members win from Roulette."</p>
<p>I truly don't understand what you're talking about.</p>
