    <h1>Casino Supermarch Hollywood Casino Kansas City Metropolis Illinois Casino Raging Bull Casino No Depo</h1>

<p>Real Dealer Studios has introduced a new version of roulette, Turbo Multifire Roulette, which makes for a fine addition to the company’s growing number of innovative and cinematic-inspired titles. The game features random multipliers and promises “massive payouts,” the company said in a press release.</p>
<p>Straight-up Bets Are the Real Winners</p>
<p>The latest title is developed based on the already established way of developing games by the company, which includes Hollywood-quality video, cutting-edge software, and an upgrade on traditional casino games, which comes with outstanding graphics, nice tweaks to the underpinning gameplay, and the potential to increase player winnings if participants get lucky. Turbo Multifire Roulette is essentially an improvement of the European roulette format, which has been used as the basis here.</p>
<p>The new game features five blazing bonus numbers which can award multipliers ranging from 50x to 500x. To get the multiplier to reward the player, they need to bet on the number itself and win – while the chances of this happening are very slim, the payout is truly massive.</p>
<p>Real Dealer Studios has made sure to reduce the time it takes to complete a round, resulting in what it describes as a “turbo” version of the gameplay. Company CPO Shane Cotter is pretty happy about the multiplier feature that he believes will truly appeal to players:</p>
<p>The prospect of hitting that 500x multiplier wins, and the sheer excitement that comes along with it, is already enough to attract a huge portion of roulette fans to this game. Real Dealer Studios CPO Shane Cotter</p>
<p>Cotter argued that the turbo gameplay would certainly appeal to players who prefer pacier gameplay which translates into more rewarding experiences for players who are keen to get more action in. But the racier gameplay and bonus numbers are not all there is, Cotter says, as there is also the amazing graphics to account for.</p>
<p>The game will begin appearing across numerous casino lobbies over the coming weeks, the CPO added, with the game available exclusively from Games Global. In September, Real Dealer Studios launched Vinnie Jones roulette with Betway.</p>
