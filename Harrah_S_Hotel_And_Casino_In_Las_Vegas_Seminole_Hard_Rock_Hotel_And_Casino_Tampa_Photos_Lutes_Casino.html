    <h1>Harrah S Hotel And Casino In Las Vegas Seminole Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tampa Photos Lutes Casino</h1>

<p>Hey team. I’d greatly appreciate your help as I’m being told the same thing week in week out with the replies getting shorter from the chat teams.</p>
<p>I’m new to these online casinos and someone I know had had some success with spin oasis so I thought I’d give it a crack.</p>
<p>My first withdrawal of $250 I was contacted within hours as there was a problem with the information I provided, fixed easily and the turnaround period from withdrawal request to it hitting my bank account was 11 days. Happy days</p>
<p>My next withdrawal of $1000AUD was requested on 12/06/2022 it’s still pending after 7 weeks. The deposit was made with a NOPLAYSALE code which had no playthrough with a 275 percent bonus with a max withdrawal of 10k</p>
<p>My next withdrawal of $2500AUD was requested on the 27/08/2022 which admittedly was only 8 days ago but the pattern doesn’t look good. This was with a VIPREALMS code which had a 30x playthough and no max cash out.</p>
<p>I can’t load any of my transactions history no matter what device I use however can still see in the cashier the details of the pending withdrawals.</p>
<p>I have multiple chat conversations of the assistants saying sorry for the delay however there is nothing they can do other than make a note and try and escalate the withdrawal. Also two emails with an attendant stating stating sorry the withdrawal team has been alerted and will escalate your withdrawal. I’ve asked if there is someone else I can talk to about my withdrawal and get the reply of sorry we’re doing everything we can.</p>
<p>Any insight would be amazing to help get this resolved.</p>
