<p>The fast-growing provider of games for the online gambling industry, CT Interactive, confirmed it forged a new deal that helped expand further the reach of the company's engaging content. Details regarding the new collaboration reveal that the company joined forces with the leading operator Kajot for the gambling market in Slovakia.</p>
<p>It was back in 2022 when CT Interactive first entered the market in the country. Now, the new partnership helps the company expand further its presence by engaging with new audiences. Per the terms of the collaboration, CT Interactive agreed to supply a number of games for the operator in Slovakia, powering its operations.</p>
<p>In a statement, CT Interactive's Head of CRM, Silvia Hristova, explained that the company entered the market last year and since then, has enjoyed incredible success within the market. "The Slovakian companies that started using our content immediately improved their results," she pointed out.</p>
<p>The collaboration comes as no surprise, considering Kajot's strong presence within the gambling market in Slovakia. In fact, the company is one of the oldest operators in the country with nearly three decades of experience within the gambling vertical.</p>
<p>Stanislav Šebest, Kajot's Head of Online Casino, was similarly delighted with the freshly minted partnership with CT Interactive. "With the addition of CT Interactive's gaming products, we continue to expand our portfolio with quality and relevant games," he said. Finally, Šebest pointed out: "Our goal is to reach a wider audience and we are sure that the award-winning games of our partner will be an excellent tool for achieving it."</p>
<p>Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive's Head of Business Development EMEA added that the company is excited to deliver its fan-favorite games to new players in Slovakia. She said that thanks to the new collaboration, Kajot's customers will be able to access games such as 20 Star Party, Coffee Magic and Cherry Crown, among other popular hits.</p>
<p>"The next step is to integrate our content into the new platform for Kajot Czech Republic and other markets as well," explained Tsankarska. Finally, she predicted that the partnership with such a trusted and recognized operator like Kajot will help boost CT Interactive's visibility within the online gambling sector in Europe.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Kajot in Slovakia comes after the company forged a deal with Sbbet.me. Teaming up with the leading online betting and gaming operator, CT Interactive expanded the reach of its content to new customers in the online gambling market of Montenegro.</p>
