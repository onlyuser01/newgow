<p>One lucky and happy guest at The Venetian Las Vegas won more than $1 million this weekend. The player was dealt a seven-card straight flush with a joker, KVVU, a local TV station, reported.</p>

<p>It was during a Face Up Pai Gow Poker game. There was a $5 side bet, too. That got them in the running for the Progressive jackpot, KVVU said. The total jackpot was $1,009,601.</p>
<p>Typically, in Pai Gow Poker, players are dealt seven cards. After one draw, players must make a two-card low hand and a five-card high hand, each as high as possible.</p>
<p>The name of The Venetian winner was kept private. Details on the game weren’t released.</p>
<p>Recent $2.8M Win</p>
<p>Also, last month, a slot player won big at The Venetian, with a jackpot of close to $3 million. It was from a $5.88 bet.</p>
<p>The winning total was $2,835,768, the casino revealed. The Venetian didn’t identify the winner, nor did it release on which day the money was won.</p>
<p>The player hit the jackpot by matching three explosion symbols. It was on the Fu Babies bonus on the Dancing Drums Explosion slot machine. The Asian-themed machine is made by SG Gaming.</p>
<p>The Venetian is to undergo a major upgrade. Apollo Global Management is planning to spend more than $1 billion to update the property. The property’s pool deck will be completely overhauled, a $50 million addition to TAO Beach Dayclub will be undertaken, and new restaurants will be added, with some debuting as soon as next year.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Las Vegas Sands announced the sale of the Venetian, Palazzo, and Venetian Expo to Apollo and VICI Properties for $6.25 billion. Apollo paid $2.25 billion for the operating rights to the venues, while VICI shelled out $4 billion for the real estate. The transaction closed this year.</p>
<p>Earlier Jackpots</p>
<p>Other Las Vegas properties have also paid out jackpots in recent months.</p>
<p>In October, a player won $496,675.95 at Bally’s Las Vegas casino. It was on a Mega Progressive Jackpot. The unnamed visitor got a royal flush while playing three-card poker. The winner chose not to release his/her name.</p>
<p>In addition, a woman won $717,738.88 on a slot at the Fremont Hotel and Casino in October. She placed a $15 bet. It was her first spin, KLAS, a local TV station, reported. The total was received from a Grand Progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>The winner lives in Hawaii. Her name wasn’t released by the casino.</p>
