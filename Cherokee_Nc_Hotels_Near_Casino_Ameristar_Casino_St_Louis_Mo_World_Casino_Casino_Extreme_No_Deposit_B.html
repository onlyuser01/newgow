<p>After developing a similar product in the iGaming segment, NetEnt and ReelPlay have agreed to tie up a partnership designed to safeguard the InfiniReels and Infinity Reels mechanic.</p>
<p>NetEnt and ReelPlay Ink Partnership to Protect “Infinity Reels”</p>
<p>Provider of high-end casino and iGaming solutions NetEnt has signed up a partnership with Australian games developer ReelPlay. The partnership comes after both companies developed independently a similar product innovating the in-game experience for consumers.</p>
<p>As per the agreement, the pair will work together to extend and protect a product they consider to be unique to the iGaming segment. NetEnt’s InfiniReels and ReelPlay’s Infinity Reels offer players an opportunity to expand the number of reels after each win.</p>
<p>There is no specific reel limit number, potentially boosting the payout multiple-fold for any player who continues to win. The Swedish game maker is preparing to release the first title named after the mechanic on May 14 with Gods of Gold InfiniReels hitting the shelves across NetEnt’s network of partners.</p>
<p>The companies have not specified whether they would seek to collaborate on products together or use their alliance to protect their technology from potential copyright infringement.</p>
<p>ReelPlay, meanwhile, has already debuted games featuring Infinity Reels. The Infinity Reels first game appeared in November 2019 with El Dorado Infinity Reels. The company has added several other games using the same mechanic since, including Giza Infinity Reels and Odin Infinity Reels.</p>
<p>Odin is slated to release in June 2020 and the other two games have already debuted and are playable on ReePlay’s network of partner casinos.</p>
<p>Independently Following Similar Ideas</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, NetEnt director of games Bryan Upton said that each company has arrived at the product on its own. He further said that the company is looking to continue adding new products that further improve NetEnt’s successful track record of innovating iGaming.</p>
<p>David Johnson, Chief Commercial Officer at ReelPlay further commented on the developments, saying: “We are happy to have agreed to a collaboration with an established, global pioneer such as NetEnt.”</p>
<p>NetEnt remains committed to developing and releasing several games a month throughout 2020. Recently, as a result of the integration of Red Tiger, a developer NetEnt acquired in 2019, NetEnt laid off 120 staff members in Stockholm and Malta, resulting from the completion of the acquisition.</p>
<p>This has not stopped NetEnt to break into new markets, including Colombia where the company is teaming up with Rush Street Interactive and in Switzerland, the company has obtained the necessary ISO 27001 certification it needs to supply online casinos in the country.</p>
