    <h1>Yellow Brick Road Casino West Bay Casino And Resort Rivers Casino Resort Doubledown Casino Promo Cod</h1>

<p>Score Media and Gaming, a Toronto-based digital media company also known as theScore, will soon launch its news sportsbook and casino app in Ontario. The company opened its app for registrations ahead of the launch of the province’s regulated gambling market.</p>
<p>TheScore to Launch on Its Home Market</p>
<p>The new application is called theScore Bet and is dedicated to catering to the needs of bettors. It will offer premium betting experiences, providing players with exciting and varied offerings. Players in Canada can already download the app and register. The only requirement for registering is being older than 19 years. However, only those who are physically located in Ontario can actually use theScore Bet to play.</p>
<p>Despite its parent company being set in Toronto, theScore Bet is yet to hit the local markets. The application has already been launched in several US jurisdictions, namely Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, and New Jersey. The Ontario launch will see theScore foray into its own home market. To celebrate the occasion, the app will host a launch party on the days prior to the market’s launch – April 2 to 4.</p>
<p>Ontario betting is scheduled to go live on April 4.</p>
<p>The Company Is Excited about the Launch</p>
<p>TheScore Bet has an agreement with the local regulator, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario. As such, it has been licensed as an iGaming operator and will work as an agent of iGaming Ontario, the body responsible for managing online gambling in the country.</p>
<p>TheScore Bet is on good terms with the local regulators thanks to its dedication to safe gambling. In January, the company became the first prospective private operator to fulfill the Canadian Responsible Gambling Council’s requirements and receive accreditation.</p>
<p>John Levy, chief executive officer of theScore, said that he is excited to launch theScore Bet in Ontario. He emphasized that local punters are already familiar with the brand and would love what the sportsbook and casino app will have to offer.</p>
<p>Levy added that the company’s team is looking forward to the launch of Ontario’s regulated betting market and is thrilled by the opportunity to demonstrate theScore’s fully integrated media and betting experience.</p>
<p>TheScore, originally founded in 2012, was acquired by Penn National Gaming in a $2 billion deal in August 2021. Not too long after the acquisition, the betting company inked an agreement with Golf Canada and became the league’s official gaming partner. Earlier that same year, theScore expanded its sports partnerships with the addition of Canlan Sports.</p>
