    <h1>Seven Clans Casino Warroad Casino In Tucson Az Vee Quiva Casino Casino Games Win Real Money Amerista</h1>

<p>As the British Columbia Lottery Corporation has joined forces with others to raise against the unchecked influence of illegal gambling websites, the BCLC is also making a change to its president &amp; CEO position with Pat Davis stepping into the job, the Board of Directors confirmed last week.</p>
<p>BCLC to Continue Building Up</p>
<p>Davis has been in the position for several days now. His appointment was welcomed by BCLC board chair Greg Moore who said that the rest of the Board was confident that Davis’ appointment would constitute an important new chapter for the corporation. Under Davis’ stint, the board is expecting to see BCLC shape itself further into “a social purpose company,” and one that upholds the highest industry standards.</p>
<p>Davis is no chance appointment either way. He has been working in and around the gambling industry for the past 20 years, cultivating the relevant knowledge he would need for his new position along the way. Moore explained:</p>
<p>We are confident his experience combined with his dedication to integrity, player health and serving the best interests of our players and our province will further propel the advancement of BCLC as a social purpose company that operates with the highest standards. BCLC board chair Greg Moore</p>
<p>Davis has held numerous leadership positions in the past, working with esteemed representatives who are also part of the gambling industry and he is a familiar face in the industry. His understanding of technology and software makes him an ideal candidate to lead the push in the iGaming segment which is of increasing import to the entirety of Canada.</p>
<p>He took his latest position over from Lynda Cavanaugh who was appointed by the BCLC’s board of directors temporarily back in January 2021. Moore used the appointment of Davis to confirm other appointees on the job, with Dan Beebe joining as a chief operating officer and Sandra Austin joining as chief people officer.</p>
