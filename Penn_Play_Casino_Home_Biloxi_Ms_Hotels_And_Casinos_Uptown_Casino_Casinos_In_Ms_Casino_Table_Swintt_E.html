<p>The provider of engaging and innovative games for the online gambling industry, Swintt, announced a new partnership with the fast-growing operator, NetBet. The new deal helps the studio expand the reach of its content by agreeing to supercharge NetBet’s growing catalog of games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new partnership, Swintt’s games will reach new audiences, allowing the studio to grow further within the iGaming vertical. The new deal will see NetBet benefit from Swintt’s SwinttPremium and SwinttGames titles, delivering supreme entertainment for its growing customer base.</p>
<p>Initially, NetBet will deploy Swintt’s content for players within all of its Malta jurisdictions. After that, upon securing its license in Germany, the gaming operator would introduce the studio’s games to that market as well, boosting significantly Swintt’s reach.</p>
<p>The two verticals NetBet will benefit from include SwinttPremium, delivering more classic-themed slots that offer engaging experiences but keep the feel of classic land-based slots, as well as SwinttGames, which offer new and innovative titles with unique mechanics.</p>
<p>SwinttGames’ titles that NetBet will benefit from include popular games such as The Crown, as well as Aloha Spirit XtraLock. On the other hand, the operator would also have the option to tap into SwinttPremium games such as Seven Books Unlimited and Master of Books Unlimited, among others. The two titles are in fact a part of Swintt’s engaging and popular Book series and offer a chance for huge wins of up to 5,000x the players’ bets.</p>
<p>The Deal Boosts NetBet’s Offering</p>
<p>Claudia Georgevici, NetBet’s PR Manager, shared her excitement about the collaboration with Swintt. She said that the company’s team likes slots and it has engaged in playing Swintt’s games. “We knew that we absolutely had to integrate its extensive portfolio of slots into our lobby, and that we have done through what is an important partnership for us,” explained Georgevici. Finally, she pointed out that NetBet is looking forward to seeing its players enjoy titles like Master of Books Unlimited and The Crown that deliver unique experiences with every spin.</p>
<p>“NetBet is a hugely popular gambling brand with players across Europe and this partnership with Swintt will allow the operator to provide fun, thrilling and rewarding experiences to its players via our slots.“ David Mann, CEO at Swintt</p>
<p>David Mann, Swintt’s CEO, explained that NetBet currently holds a leadership position within the gaming market in Europe. He predicted that the collaboration will supercharge the operator by delivering engaging new slots.</p>
<p>Mann pointed out that SwinttGames and SwinttPremium titles deliver something for everyone. Finally, Swintt’s CEO predicted that the partnership will not only meet but exceed the expectations of NetBet players that will have the option to enjoy new and thrilling games.</p>
