<p>OnAir Entertainment, an esteemed provider of live casino products, has struck a new partnership with LeoVegas Group</p>
<p>This is the beginning of a global collaboration, the two companies confirmed in a press release. As a result, LeoVegas players will gain access to a number of outstanding titles developed by OnAir Entertainment.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment Has Plenty to Offer to LeoVegas</p>
<p>Among those are games such as Roulette Blackjack, Standard Blackjack, Speed Blackjack, Streamicon, Eclipse Blackjack, AutoRoulette, 9 Pots of Gold, Card Matchup, and other titles.</p>
<p>There will also be branded content to help boost the overall immersion and brand awareness. OnAir Entertainment creates real-life games that stand out by virtue of their design, gameplay, and outstanding ambiance and graphics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the partnership will focus heavily and exclusively on regulated gambling markets. Commenting on the tie-up, OnAir Entertainment business development director Seval Kaya hailed the opportunity to work with LeoVegas Group and provide the company with OnAir’s own outstanding products.</p>
<p>“Thanks to LeoVegas’ extraordinary expertise and incredible scope, our high-quality portfolio of tailored games is already bringing an immersive experience to many more players,” Kaya said. OnAir has been determined to continue expanding its reach in the gaming market worldwide.</p>
<p>The company has confirmed its plans to push forward in the United States by introducing a dedicated studio this year, which will help it scale its live operations, and follow in the footsteps of Evolution and other market leaders with a strong North American presence already.</p>
<p>This is significant progress given the fairly short time OnAir Entertainment has been live. Founded at the very end of 2020, the company spent the following two years building up its offer and expanding its operational hubs. It has developed a number of state-of-the-art studios that allow it to stream live casino games for numerous partners, including LeoVegas Group right now.</p>
<p>The company has operations set up in Georgia, Romania, Spain, Latvia, and the United States and it is determined to continue delivering outstanding performance for all of its clients.</p>
