<p>Sands China has completed an exercise that allows it to reduce the weight of its leveraged debt. The Asian arm of casino operator Las Vegas Sands submitted a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) yesterday, explaining that it had redeemed $1.8 billion in senior notes. The move comes on the heels of another exercise that saw the company offer other senior notes, but at a lower interest rate, to investors.</p>
<p>Sands China Cashes In Early</p>
<p>Sands China reportedly redeemed the senior notes on September 24, but filed the move with the HKSE yesterday. The notes carried an interest rate of 4.6% and were to become due in 2023, but new senior unsecured notes the company offered allowed it to shuffle its debt. The filing included a request to withdraw the listing of the notes and Sands China expects that withdrawal to be completed as of October 6.</p>
<p>The exercise was made possible after Sands China released senior unsecured notes to investors with an aggregate principal amount of $1.95 billion, of which $1.93 billion helped cover the redemption. The company also had to add in some of its own cash reserves to cover accrued interest and the make-whole premium tied to the notes, but the new investment options will ultimately save the company money. The buy-and-sell exercise is designed to “further strengthen the liquidity position of the group,” according to a note from Sands China on September 10.</p>
<p>New Notes to Shore Up Operations</p>
<p>The redemption of the senior notes took place just a day after Sands China wrapped up the $1.95 billion offering, which took place in three separate tranches. According to company filings, it distributed $700 million with an annual interest rate of 2.3% in the first tranche, with those notes maturing in March 2027. The second tranche included $650 million in notes with a 2.85% interest rate and a March 2029 maturity. The third involved $600 million, with a 3.25% interest rate and maturity of August 2031.</p>
<p>Previous filings have also shown billion-dollar deals. In June of last year, Sands China issued $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes to institutional buyers in two tranches. The first covered $800 million and had a 3.8% interest rate and a January 2026 maturity. The remained was issued in the second tranche, offering an interest rate of 4.375% and maturing in June 2030. This past July, the company was approved for a third waiver extension on its $3-billion credit facility with Bank of China Limited.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands hasn’t been performing too well in the market lately. At the end of March, it was trading at $59.72 and, as of yesterday afternoon, was down to $37.30 following an almost continuous slide. Sands China has followed a similar path, dropping from HKD$38.60 ($4.96) at the end of March to HKD$15.76 ($2.03) today.</p>
