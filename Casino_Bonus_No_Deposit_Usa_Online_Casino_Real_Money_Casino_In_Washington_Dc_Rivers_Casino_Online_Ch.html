    <h1>Casino Bonus No Deposit Usa Online Casino Real Money Casino In Washington Dc Rivers Casino Online Ch</h1>

<p>ok where do i start. I usually go on here and watch the reviews before depositing but have come across with bad reviews but still treated me fair. This casino reviews with all the negative marks are very much correct. I have first been treated unfairly when i was given a free chip that was loaded on my account by the account manager due to my deposits and play time. I had just lost off a deposit match as well as a free chip that came with the coupon used. I check my account to deposit i see a free chip was added by the manager. Again something i never ever asked for. I played the chip and actually won and they refused to pay my 100 dollar winnings stating i redeemed 2 free chips in a row. Ummm no i didnt yall did that and broke your own rules, I cant remove the chip so I had to play it out and actually won and they punished me for winning off a gift they loaded onto my account. So after arguing that and telling support for the 5th time to just remove the damn chip so i can deposit and play and actually win. So i do a deposit match of 66 dollars for 600 percent and a free chip of 200 once done. the max cashout was at 10x my deposit in which once calculated was no more then $700 according to support. I completed my play through I did a withdrawal of $400 right below my max and they took away from my winnings and approved me for a withdrawal of $284. I asked wheres my money they told me the max was $700 and they remove the bonus from that in which my true max cashout is $284?!?!?!? that dont make sense no where AT ALL and its bogus rules and terms given. I let that go and now at this point just want my money. My withdrawal was approved as of 8/18. I was told to send on documents for my withdrawal in which is crypto and all deposits was done in crypto so why they need my documents is beyond my comprehension. I send the documents get a email back from support its received and to give them 24 hours. That was a friday so monday i call and chat asked where is my winnings im told to give it 4 days . Ok i do tht contact them again that friday and was told ohh im sorry you need to send them again they didnt get them. I call bs cause i got a email from the support team that it has been received. I then provide it to all their support emails as well as the banking team. I provide the documents in the chat support because youre able to attatch to the support. I call and send a tect with everything to no avail at all and still waiting on my winnings. I have waited and sent the documents 3 times already and theyre still holding my winnings and asking me to wait until friday 9/01. This is sad and ridiculous and im under the impression they dont want to pay. This is the same casino im still waiting on my winnings from a free chip that i sent my documents in and i was told they took over FunClub and i should get those as well and still havent heard anything and been pushed to the side EVERYTIME i ask. If i dont receive my winnings by Friday I will be contacting the FTC and other departments and reporting them for crypto currency fraud. Basically promising a product and experience and not delivering on the promise once payment has been made.</p>
