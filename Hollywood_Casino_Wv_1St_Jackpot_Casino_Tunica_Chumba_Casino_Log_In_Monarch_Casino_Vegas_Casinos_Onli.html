    <h1>Hollywood Casino Wv 1St Jackpot Casino Tunica Chumba Casino Log In Monarch Casino Vegas Casinos Onli</h1>

<p>About a month ago I won $10000, I requested a withdrawal filled out my bank details and was asked to send proof of account using a bank statement. I did this but was told it did not match the account information &amp; was emailed the bsb &amp; account numbers. I told them those where not the details I entered (I still have the email for this conversation) so I canceled the withdrawal &amp; re done it making sure I 100% entered my correct account details, after asking via live chat, if I should submit my bank statement again I was told that was not necessary. However the funds where released to the wrong account. Contacted live chat several times to be told it was released into my account, when I enquired about the bank account it was released to I was told it was in my account only to be told by another supposed person that it was transferred to the account I’d told them was wrong.</p>
<p>an investigation was launched 2 weeks ago (About 25th June 2020) where I was told it should be 24-48 hours before I received any feed back. It’s now been 2 WEEKS &amp; I’m being told it could be more than a month before I get any information on when this problem will be resolved. They seem to think telling me on live chat that I should receive the funds on my end, makes up for all the time I’ve already waited, due to a mistake on there end in the first place.</p>
<p>i understand due to the circumstances at the moment things maybe a little slow but I would’ve thought depositing 10 grand into the wrong account would be a top priority!</p>
