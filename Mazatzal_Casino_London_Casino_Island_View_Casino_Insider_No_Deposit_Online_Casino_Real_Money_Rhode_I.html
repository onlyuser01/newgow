<p>The 2023-24 Premier League brings us much excitement this coming weekend, with one of the hottest matchups being the one that will take place at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, October 21. The game in question is Chelsea vs. Arsenal</p>
<p>Chelsea vs. Arsenal is a London Derby, which is a fact that makes it interesting by default. However, Saturday’s duel is interesting for many other reasons, including the fact that the Gunners stand a chance to get to the No. 1 spot in the Premier League standings if they win.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs. Arsenal Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Chelsea +210 Draw +229 Arsenal +129</p>

<p>Chelsea Hoping to Keep the Good Run Going</p>
<p>After a disappointing couple of games last month, the Blues from London are playing great soccer in October. They’re 3-0 this month, with two of those wins happening in the 2023-24 English Premier League. Unfortunately for Chelsea’s fans, there’s a caveat – both of those wins happened against much weaker sides (Fulham and Burnley).</p>
<p>Still, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the Blues can’t keep the good run going. They have a solid roster, which cost the club owner hundreds of millions of dollars to assemble. There are some really talented players on the team, but many of them have yet to start showing their worth.</p>
<p>Nicolas Jackson, for example, who arrived from Villarreal for a fee of more than $40 million, has scored only two Premier League goals so far. His colleague from the attacking department Mykhailo Mudryk also needs to step up, as he’s got only one EPL goal to his name this season.</p>
<p>The bad news for them is that scoring against Arsenal won’t be easy as the Gunners are in top shape at the moment.</p>
<p>Arsenal Going for the No. 1 Place in the Prem</p>
<p>The Gunners are currently second in the Premier League with 20 points, which is the same as table leader Tottenham. The two also have the same score differential (+10), but the Spurs are higher because they’ve scored two goals more than Arsenal.</p>
<p>Mikel Arteta’s men have scored 16 goals thus far while conceding just six. This is really impressive given that they’ve played against some really tough opponents, including Manchester United, Tottenham, and Manchester City. All this has probably done wonders for their confidence, which surely is a big plus heading into the game with Chelsea.</p>
<p>Another thing going in the Gunners’ favor is the fact that Bukayo Saka and a few others might return after missing the previous game(s) due to injury problems.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs. Arsenal Prediction</p>
<p>Arsenal won each of the last three duels with Chelsea that took place at Stamford Bridge. We think a fourth straight win is coming this weekend. The Gunners are just way, way better than the Blues in 2023, not to mention that they’ve got confidence, as well as huge motivation to win on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pick: Arsenal to win</p>
