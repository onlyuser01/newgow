    <h1>Caesars Casino Las Vegas Plainville Casino Riverwind Casino Apache Gold Casino Resort The Big M Casi</h1>

<p>Hello, I deposited EUR 400 at this casino via VISA on 12/31/2022 and used the 100% welcome bonus. I have successfully passed the game conditions (28,000 EUR gaming turnover) with a maximum stake of 3 EUR on various NETENT slots and in the end 1800 EUR would be converted into real money. I applied for this in 2 payment requests (1000 and 800 EUR) to my VISA card for payment. I then submitted the necessary documents for account verification (copy of VISA card, copy of ID, proof of address). A few days later my account was frozen so I no longer have access. Repeated inquiries in the live chat have shown that I have received emails from security@artcasion.io. But these emails never reached me, I said that several times in the live chat. Today there was a colleague from Security in the live chat who said there was a suspicion of a "TC violation" and they are currently checking whether I can get the money I paid back before my account is closed. I asked what rules I should have broken, because I was told there were conspicuous ways of playing that I should have already done in other casinos.</p>
<p>I am very sure that I did not violate any bonus terms and conditions. I've always played with the allowed bets in allowed slots, that's probably the only conspicuous way of playing that I've also used in other casinos.</p>
