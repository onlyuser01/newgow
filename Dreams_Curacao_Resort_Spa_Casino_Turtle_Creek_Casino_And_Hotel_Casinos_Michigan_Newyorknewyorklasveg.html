<p>Crystal Palace are going across the Thames this Sunday to take on the EPL table leaders Arsenal at Emirates Stadium in North London</p>
<p>Twenty-seven rounds have passed in the 2022-23 Premier League and Arsenal are still sitting top of the table. What’s got to worry the Gunners is that the reigning champions are breathing by their necks with only five points fewer.</p>
<p>What this means is that if they want to win their first EPL title since 2004, they need to keep on winning. The game with Crystal Palace seems like a great opportunity for Mikel Arteta’s men to record another win. Are we going to see them do it?</p>

<p>Arsenal Taking Things Super Seriously</p>
<p>The Gunners are sitting at the top of the table, showing no signs that they’re gonna drop out of there anytime soon. Their form in the English top flight has been nothing short of phenomenal with five wins in a row.</p>
<p>They did lose on the continent, though. Last Thursday, they suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to Portuguese side, Sporting CP. As a result, their European journey has finished for this season. However, this isn’t a disaster necessarily. It allows the Gunners to focus entirely on the Premier League. That said, you can be certain that they’re gonna go all-in on Sunday against their rivals from South London.</p>
<p>Crystal Place Hoping to End Their Horrible Run</p>
<p>The Eagles are without a single win in 2023 in all competitions. Plus, they lost each of their last three games. As a result, they’re out of the FA Cup, while in the Premier League, they’ve dropped dangerously close to the relegation zone.</p>
<p>Right now, they’re in the No. 12 place in the EPL standings, which may not seem too bad at first glance. However, they got only three points more than the closest team stuck in the relegation zone.</p>
<p>The main reason behind their abysmal run is that their offense has been very anemic. These guys haven’t scored a single goal in their last four. Plus, the last time we saw Crystal Palace put away more than one goal was on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Crystal Palace Prediction</p>
<p>This is a must-win game for the Gunners in their effort to win their first Premier League title in 19 years. Everything is going in their favor ahead of the Crystal Palace game, so anything but a big win on Sunday would be a huge upset.</p>
<p>Picks: Arsenal to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
