<p>ZeroFlucs, an Australian B2B sports betting startup, has reinforced its team with a new strategic advisor. The one joining the fresh wagering company is none other than Benjie Cherniak, principal at Avenue H Capital.</p>
<p>Cherniak Will Help the Startup</p>
<p>Cherniak is an experienced individual who has formerly served as the managing director of Don Best, another sports betting company that offers wagering, stats, odds and all data punters might need.</p>
<p>As announced by the sports betting company, the new advisor has over 15 years of experience in both the US and international sports betting scene. As someone with such extensive expertise in the sector, Cherniak will play a pivotal role in helping ZeroFlucs achieve its growth targets.</p>
<p>ZeroFlucs is a sports betting provider that powers operators in the sector with software. Its solutions help companies greatly improve their pricings while utilizing their proprietary data sources and relationships. Some of ZeroFlucs’ market deliverables include solutions such as Same-Game and Same-Race parlays and blended betting, among other improvements.</p>
<p>The startup quickly penetrated the Australian market and is now looking to go international and establish a presence in North America as well.</p>
<p>ZeroFlucs “Can’t Imagine a Better Partner”</p>
<p>Cherniak spoke about joining ZeroFlucs. He said that the company is a “game changer” that offers unique racing products for sportsbook operators. He noted that the startup allows companies to significantly augment market offerings and do so while leveraging a gambling company’s existing pricing feeds. This ensures greater pricing accuracy and enhances the betting experience.</p>
<p>Cherniak concluded that he is thrilled to join the fresh company as an advisor.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to be aligning with Steve and his capable team as they introduce their technology stateside and beyond. Benjie Cherniak, strategic advisor, ZeroFlucs</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the founder of ZeroFlucs, Steve Gray, said that working with Cherniak is going to assist his team in further refining its strategy and boosting its growth. His advice will help the company with refining its product positioning and messaging. He will also provide the company with key contacts and market insights.</p>
<p>Gray called Cherniak “a proven commodity” in sports betting.</p>
<p>Nearly every operator has worked with him in some capacity over the years and everyone in the industry respects his understanding of the market. It’s hard to imagine a better partner for us on this journey. Steve Gray, founder, ZeroFlucs</p>
<p>In other news, a few days ago, ZeroFlucs unveiled a new partnership agreement with TopSport.</p>
