    <h1>Nassau Casino Oceans Casino Ac Soundtrack To Casino Monte Carlo Resort And Casino Netent Casino Bond</h1>

<p>Hello BJD99,</p>
<p>Well done on your win at the casino!!</p>
<p>Please note that we are the support team for the affiliates and we will always do our best to chase up any player queries coming through.</p>
<p>We do understand your frustration with the withdrawal process and we do agree that the 1st withdrawal can sometimes be very frustrating, let me explain you the process, this might give you some light on why is taking so long.</p>
<p>All first time withdrawals are subject to an extensive process of verifications. Please note that the casino receives hundreds of withdrawals requests worldwide.</p>
<p>All verifications are carried by the different departments within the Security team. All done with a tight protocol and each department won't share any of the player information to any other department or team. On top of that no one from security teams makes contact with players, they do their request to costumer support.</p>
<p>So, you requested your 1st withdrawal, documentation is required by KYC department. If they approve all the required docs their job is done and the request goes to the next set, if not they will approve what is accepted but they will reject the withdrawal. If withdrawal is reject a report with what is outstanding is send to costumer support and they will contact the player.</p>
<p>In your case KYC got approved and your withdrawal request went to the product department from the security team to a quick overlook of your game play, this is usually to check if you haven't exceeded any bet limit. Then was sent to payments team. This team did not approved and again, sent a report with what is required to costumer support.</p>
<p>Note that if at any moment the process exceeds the time limit to be complete the funds are reverse to your account.</p>
<p>During all of this costumer support doesn't have a process status information, for example, if a request is with the payment team they don't know it, for them is being processed. Basically, their are only messenger in a withdrawal process.</p>
<p>Every time a withdrawal request is made the process follows the same procedure and in your case what happened was that the product security team randomly selected your request for a full gameplay review. That is only performed if payment team approves the payment.</p>
<p>This is in fact random, only requests from players that have never been through this check in the past year can be selected. I have seen complains of players claiming that this is not random it was just because the player is requesting a high amount, this is not true, product doesn't know anything about your withdraw amount or the player. For them is a series of plays with a very long number (which will be your ID in the game play) that they have to check.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as aforementioned this can be a frustrating process for the player. The good new is that it won't be like that on your next withdrawals. After this you almost get a green card to cashout.</p>
<p>Please just be a little more patient with the casino in this process. As you can see this is not beneficial to them, all of this only overloads the teams involved.</p>
<p>On behalf of the casino we would like to apologise for the bad experience you are having so far and thank you for your patience and understanding. For any further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Congratulations on your win and we wish you many more.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Bondibet Support Team</p>
