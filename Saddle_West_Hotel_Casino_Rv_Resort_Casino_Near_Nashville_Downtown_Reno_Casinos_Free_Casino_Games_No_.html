<p>Sportradar will serve as the CONMEBOL official AV betting rights partner for the next four seasons</p>
<p>Sports data and technology company Sportradar announced today it has been selected as the winner of the bidding process for the exclusive global audio and video (AV) and betting data rights of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL).</p>
<p>Enhance Accessibility and Engagement</p>
<p>The announcement that CONMEBOL has granted exclusive AV and betting data rights to Sportradar puts an end to a highly competitive selection process. The Nasdaq-listed data technology company is expected to enhance the accessibility and engagement of South American football for global audiences.</p>
<p>Carsten Koerl, global chief executive officer of Sportradar, commented on the development, delighted to see Sportradar as the winner of the competitive process and receive the rights to “support the most historic club tournaments in South America.”</p>
<p>“Sportradar has more than 20 years’ experience building innovative products from data, and as the market leader, we are best positioned with the technological expertise and industry relationships to help CONMEBOL expand its reach,” Koerl said.</p>
<p>South American football has one of the most passionate fan bases in the world, and we look forward to working closely with the federation to support their engagement. Carsten Koerl, global CEO, Sportradar</p>
<p>The exclusive rights agreement commences with the current season and covers the rights for the next four seasons for the regional club tournaments governed by CONMEBOL, including CONMEBOL Libertadores, CONMEBOL Sudamericana and CONMEBOL Recopa, and represents the first time the governing body grants domestic AV betting rights for the club competitions.</p>
<p>Getting ‘Closer to the True Fans’</p>
<p>Highlighting Sportradar as “one of the best companies in terms of technological innovation and transparency in global sports betting,” CONMEBOL secretary general José Astigarraga was delighted at the opportunity “to strengthen the relationship” with the sports data provider.</p>
<p>We are sure that the prestigious CONMEBOL club tournaments, with more than 60 years of history, will be a great showcase to be able to get closer to the true fans of South American football. José Astigarraga, secretary general, CONMEBOL</p>
<p>As the governing body of ten national football associations in South America, CONMEBOL attracts millions of football fans and viewers globally and its competitions experienced growth in viewership over the past few years due to the expanding base of CONMEBOL international fans.</p>
<p>CONMEBOL granted Sportradar the rights due to the company’s commitment to product innovation and superior development in advanced technologies, such as computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as its key position as a supplier of integrity services.</p>
<p>Sportradar and CONMEBOL have been partners since 2019 as the data company has been providing compliance, risk and governance services to the South American football organization such as eligibility checks on the body’s and its associated members’ senior appointments via its Intelligence &amp; Investigations unit.</p>
