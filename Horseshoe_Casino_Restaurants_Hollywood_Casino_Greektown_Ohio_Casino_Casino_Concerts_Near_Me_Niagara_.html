<p>Dear Anto1318,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. First, I’d like to explain to you what the difference is between closing the account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can reopen the account anytime, and the casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances (after cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who are addicted/with gambling problems).</p>
<p>From what I can see in the attached screenshots, you requested an account closure, and there is no mention of self-exclusion or gambling addiction, and it is clear that the reason was the casino's license. If the casino wasn’t informed about your problem before you made those deposits, we, unfortunately, cannot proceed with this case as failed self-exclusion and you are not entitled to a refund.</p>
<p>If there is a message in which you clearly state your gambling problem as a reason for account closure, please forward it to kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
