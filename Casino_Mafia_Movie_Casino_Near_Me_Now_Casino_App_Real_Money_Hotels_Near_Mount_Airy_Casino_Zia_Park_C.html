    <h1>Casino Mafia Movie Casino Near Me Now Casino App Real Money Hotels Near Mount Airy Casino Zia Park C</h1>

<p>I wont R19500 fair and square using my own money, my withdrawal was then declined ,because I redeemed a coupon that you allowed me to redeem after I cashed out my winnings. That should have no impact on my previous winnings as it did not mix with the coupon. What Sane person will risk 19K for 25 cheap free spins?</p>
<p>This is very unethical and I see it as just looking for a reason not to pay my winnings which i won fair and square.</p>
<p>They voided my winning because of the following rule:</p>
<p>Players with one or more pending withdrawals currently in their account are not eligible to receive any bonuses, promotional or otherwise, until such withdrawals are either processed or cancelled. Abuse of this policy, as defined by the casino, may result in cancellation of the player's winnings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Abuse is defined as any action that is intentionally harmful or malicious --- This was not Abuse, It was a false positive ignorant mistake, where is your responsibility for offering it to me ? --- This says that it may result in a player's winnings but it does not define whether ist the winnings before or after the coupon. --- The redemption should have no impact on previous withdrawals. --- Imagine going into a brick and mortar casino and they confiscate your chips because they offered you a free coupon. --- This Rule is absolutely absurd and not held by any other RTG casino.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are so strict on your rules , but your services are illegal in South Africa.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Operators offering or wishing to offer such gambling products and services to theSouth African public must be aware that they are committing an offence, and will besubject to criminal prosecution if detected.</p>
<p>I thought your company was legit, but it certainly is not. I feel scammed that you refused to pay me because of a small technicality which is not valid as you are not allowed to operate in SA.</p>
<p>I don't want to make any threats but I am not happy at all about this treatment. One of the agents said that I should not report it to the bank and you as the security team will sort it out.</p>
<p>I don't even want my winnings anymore because that is illegal which i was unaware of. I want ALL MY DEPOSITS BACK, THOSE MADE SINCE THE CREATION OF THE ACCOUNT (PRE-ACTIVATION AND POST ACTIVATION).</p>
<p>I have all the bank records here. The lady on the chat said that she will request a refund and close my account and that you will pay me in BTC.</p>
<p>no precautions, adequate or otherwise appear to have been taken by the Casino to prevent abuse of the clause, Abuse initiated by the Casino</p>
<p>By contravening it's own terms &amp; conditions and by being complicit in the actions of the customer inadvertent or otherwise, places the casino in the same position as the customer, The Casino is not in any position to sanction the customer in any way because it is the initiating party.</p>
<p>It is unreasonable to then place further financial burden on the customer by expropriating credit in his casino account and or money belonging to the customer, that has been withdrawn.</p>
<p>I do believe that should this matter be heard in court, Springbok would not win. If I need to seek legal recourse I will.</p>
<p>Please pay me what you took. I am getting tired of asking, tired of giving you all the reasons why you are wrong in what you have done. Seriously, own your mistake apologise for it, make it right and then we can move on.</p>
<p>Can the casino please explain to me how deliberately exposing me to the abuse that they are punishing me for</p>
<p>is in anyway an effort to to ensure my safety. Ensuring my safety is not exposing me to it in the first place. It is your</p>
<p>responsibility to not send the coupon in the first place.</p>
<p>When your system clearly has the capability to not allow coupons to be redeemed by an individual if the</p>
<p>I did not accept you breaking your own t&amp;c's. I do not accept your actions in which you deliberately expose me to the very abuse that you punish me for. You have no business sending anyone who is in the process of a withdrawal any communications inviting them to redeem a bonus. A bonus you then allow them to redeem and then play with. You do this with the specific intention of intercepting the withdrawal and taking the contents. This is a clear abuse of your position of trust. It is not in the spirit of your t&amp;c's. And it is frankly underhanded, dishonest and disgusting. I do not accept any notion that this constitutes fair gaming and according to the fair gaming codec as written by the admin on this site, it puts your casino squarely in the bracket of 'not a safe casino to play in'.</p>
