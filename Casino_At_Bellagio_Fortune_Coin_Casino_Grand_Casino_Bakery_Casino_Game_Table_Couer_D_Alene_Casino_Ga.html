<p>The change to the gambling regulations in the Australian state will be in effect in 60 days after which operators may be subject to penalties if they do not comply</p>
<p>The gambling regulator in Victoria, Australia, the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC), announced it implemented a major change affecting betting on sports with the participation of minors. On Thursday, the gambling watchdog unveiled that it will prohibit the offering of betting on all under 19 sports competitions. Additionally, the VGCCC said that it will impose a ban on bets involving the performance of athletes who are under the age of 18, regardless if they participate in open events along with seniors.</p>
<p>The new regulations are set to come into effect in 60 days. Licensed operators in Victoria, as well as bodies controlling major sports, will be able to use this period to change their policies and implement the new restrictions. According to the VGCCC, after the period, it will be considered an offense if an operator offers betting on events involving minors.</p>
<p>But what does the ban exactly encompass? Judging by details released by the gambling watchdog, the betting ban applies to all sporting events for under 19s, as well as sporting events where all participants are minors.</p>
<p>Effectively, the change will restrict betting companies from offering wagers such as “first player to take a wicket,” “most disposals,” or “first goal of the game,” for events with players that are minors. An exception to the general ban would be for open events where those under 18 may be playing along with seniors. In such cases, betting on minors will still be prohibited but wagers would be allowed for the team outcome.</p>
<p>The Gambling Watchdog Will Monitor the Betting Sector</p>
<p>VGCCC’s chair, Fran Thorn, commented on the ban saying that it is not acceptable for wagers to be placed on sports with minors. She acknowledged the need to protect minors, explaining that gambling “raises integrity issues, with the prospect of people attempting to influence how minors might behave playing sport.”</p>
<p>“The VGCCC is of the view that betting on contingencies in sporting events relating to the performance of an individual minor in that sporting event is contrary to the public interest,“ explains the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission</p>
<p>Thorn said that the operator will remain vigilant and in the event of non-compliance, it will take definitive actions. Such can include prosecution of the betting providers and even license revocation, warned the regulator’s chair. She reiterated the set of rules that prohibit wagers on individual actions for minor athletes, explaining that bets would be allowed on the open team performance.</p>
<p>Last month, lawmakers in Victoria confirmed plans for the implementation of restrictions for electronic gaming machines (EGMs). The latest changes focus on restrictions such as mandatory pre-commitment limits, carded play and a significant decrease in load-up limits.</p>
