    <h1>Gun Lake Casino San Manuel Casino Hotel Oklahoma Casino Northstar Casino Casino Restaurant Nyc Duelz</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have now forwarded on the IBAS ruling email I received hopefully you will be able to open and read it.</p>
<p>I live rent free with my daughter and son-in-law and it is not uncommon for me to send money to my daughters bank account, my son/in-laws bank account or my grandson for that matter. Likewise they send me money to get things for them.</p>
<p>My daughter buys most of my clothes &amp; shoes online for me and I just send her the money for them and if I need anything else she get it for me. Sometimes I ask my son-in-law to get something from the supermarket or if it’s a present for my daughters birthday e.g</p>
<p>I cannot speak on her verification documentation that was provided but it may be possible my bank details were on a transaction/s showing on her bank account if I had purchased something at that time.</p>
<p>At the time I joined and was playing then won my daughter had already self excluded and I think her account was actually closed as per her request. Other than using my daughters old phone she has no involvement in this what’s so ever.</p>
<p>I have had no response from the new ADR but the rules are quite clear if you have already raised a complaint from one ADR you cannot raise another with a new ADR meaning I am in limbo. I cannot raise a new complaint and after almost 9 months of chasing and getting a ruling I cannot appeal it either.</p>
<p>I raised a complaint on IBAS themselves as they kept telling me they were waiting on information from the gambling commission and on checking this with the gambling commission personally they confirmed that they were in the dark as to what IBAS was saying. I had several calls with the gambling commission and sent emails to them showing very clearly the email trail from IBAS continually stating the were waiting on information from the gambling commission before a ruling could be made. They had, had no contact with IBAS regarding my case and did not know what information was required and confirmed it strange and unusual especially the length of time as they don’t take the length of time IBAS indicated they had been waiting to reply to a query it is normally a quick response turn around</p>
<p>After raising a complaint against IBAS, they suddenly decide to discuss my case at and deem they can make a ruling based on the information they have had right from the very start. Funnily in the space of a few weeks Duelz has left IBAS and went elsewhere. I would assume IBAS must have know Duelz was leaving and going elsewhere and potentially shelved my complaint or dragged it out to the point they were no longer responsible for them.</p>
<p>My initial IBAS complaint was raised in March 2022 and after 6 weeks I started getting "we are waiting on the gambling commission coming back to us" it’s went onto December until I forced the issue by speaking to the Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>Below is an extract of the operators response noted in the ruling from IBAS the reason I have highlighted this is because it is completely wrong. I had 19 deposits to Duelz and each and everyone of those was shown to have come from my bank account in my name so the proof they provided was wrong the payment method used to fund those deposits was registered as being in MY NAME and NOT anyone else.</p>
<p>Also all monies they did return went into my account if someone else had funded my DUELZ account using there own card not registered to me the money should technically be returned to them.</p>
<p>The company states that the person who they believed to be operating the account had used different personal details in an attempt to open other accounts despite having self-excluded and registered with GamStop.</p>
<p>This was me because DUELZ blocked my account without any notification or communication and I thought I had broken my user so was trying to access the site only with the view to reaching the CHAT option so I could actually chat to a person about what was happening. I started to panic when I tried different details to gain access to chat but just to be clear even though I was trying everything to get to the chat area no new accounts were actually created. I did not realise DUELZ had locked my account I thought it was something I was doing wrong. Just to be clear I MYSELF WAS NOT self-excluded or registered with GamStop</p>
<p>Operator Response</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The company have responded that their initial automated checks had not detected the link to the other account but further manual checks into the card used to fund the account had led them to believe that it was in fact being operated by a person who had self- excluded. They have provided database records which show the payment method was registered as being in that person’s name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company also state that the person who they believed to be operating the account had used different personal details in an attempt to open other accounts despite having self-excluded and registered with GamStop.</p>
