<p>FanDuel, an American gambling company, has introduced branded online live dealer games in Pennsylvania, following the success of its live casino offerings.</p>
<p>The Operator Unveils Branded Live Dealer Games</p>
<p>FanDuel first launched live casino offerings in Pennsylvania in 2020. At first, the operator offered 21 slot titles and a handful of live dealer games. The offerings quickly became popular among fans, which prompted FanDuel to expand them. Right now, FanDuel offers more than 150 slot titles and a variety of live casino games, including blackjack, baccarat, first-person craps, poker, casino war and roulette, among others.</p>
<p>The popularity of the online casino vertical placed Pennsylvania as one of the highest-earning states in the USA. According to Kevin Hennessy, director of publicity for FanDuel, live dealer games are especially popular among the operator’s customer base. Because of that, the company is happy to launch the first FanDuel-branded Live Dealer games in the Keystone State.</p>
<p>In an interview with PlayPennsylvania, Hennesy said:</p>
<p>Live Dealer games are important in building out the casino experience for FanDuel players. We set up the studio in a way that brings the FanDuel brand to life. Kevin Hennessy, director of publicity, FanDuel</p>
<p>FanDuel’s offerings in Pennsylvania will include 7 branded blackjack tables, a branded infinite blackjack table and a FanDuel roulette table. The company launched its new offerings in Michigan as well.</p>
<p>The Company Plans to Channel Sports Bettors towards Online Casino</p>
<p>FanDuel recognizes how important live dealer games are to the online gambling ecosystem. Playing online comes with a myriad of advantages, which is why more and more people pick the vertical. For example, online players have the luxury to play from the comfort of their homes. In addition, they can avoid crowded places and not have to worry about COVID or other diseases. Furthermore, online play can serve as a gateway for novice players who want to learn more about gambling at their own pace.</p>
<p>According to FanDuel, its branded live dealer games are suitable for both inexperienced greenhorns and seasoned veterans. Additionally, many tables allow late joiners to bet on outcomes while some allow any number of players to play at the same time. Thanks to that, live casino players never have to sit idly and wait.</p>
<p>FanDuel has an extra goal, which is to channel its sports betting customers towards its online casino offerings. The company holds a respectable 40% share of the PA sports betting market and its sportsbook is frequented by men and women alike. Because of this, FanDuel is well-positioned to grow its online casino segment by turning some of its sports bettors into online casino players.</p>
