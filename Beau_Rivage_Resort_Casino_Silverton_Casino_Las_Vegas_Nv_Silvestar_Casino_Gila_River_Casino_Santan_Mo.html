<p>Daily fantasy and sports book operator DraftKings announced today it entered into an exclusive multi-year arrangement with the New York Giants. According to the terms of the deal, DraftKings is becoming the Official Sports Betting, iGaming and Daily Fantasy operator for the franchise from the National Football League (NFL).</p>
<p>SportsLounge to Further Engage with Fans</p>
<p>The partnership with the Giants will grant DraftKings access to official marks and logos of the franchise, as well as a first of its kind virtual SportsLounge during game days, which represents a unique way of engaging with attendees on all platforms of the sports betting brand.</p>
<p>“The New York Giants have continued to be a fantastic organization to work with over the years, and we are excited to expand our relationship as the Giants’ Official Exclusive Sports Betting, iGaming and Daily Fantasy operator.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>The collaboration with the NFL franchise looks to further strengthen customer engagement throughout the football season, as football remains the most popular sports on DraftKings’ platform. To entice fans of the NFL franchise, DraftKings and the Giants will introduce a free-to-play game on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>“Both organizations remain committed to customer experience through enhanced product offerings and authenticity and look forward to joining forces across platforms as the highly-anticipated NFL season gets underway.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>Long-Lasting Partnership Deepens</p>
<p>The partnership between the daily fantasy sports and betting company and the NFL team has been running for a number of years, and the Giants even rank among the top 40 on DraftKings’ platform, out of more than 700 sports teams.</p>
<p>“Our enhanced agreement with DraftKings provides innovative opportunities as we look to deliver a best-in-class fan experience. DraftKings is the preeminent leader in sports betting and daily fantasy sports and we are excited to be the first NFL team to have an exclusive integrated deal in this category.” Pete Guelli, Chief Commercial Officer, The New York Giants</p>
<p>Under the new arrangement, the Boston-based sports betting operator is receiving premier brand integration across MetLife Staduim during home games, as well as recognition as a sponsor and exclusive category advertiser in all media controlled by the Giants, television (NBC, MSG Networks, MY9), radio (Entercom/WFAN) and social (Giants.com and the Giants’ mobile app).</p>
<p>The partnership deal between the Giants and DraftKings is the latest between a sports betting company and an NFL team. In June, Denver Broncos made history by signing the first NFL sports betting partnership with Flutter-owned FanDuel, and then followed up by signing a deal with BetMGM, to make the sports book an official sports betting partner.</p>
