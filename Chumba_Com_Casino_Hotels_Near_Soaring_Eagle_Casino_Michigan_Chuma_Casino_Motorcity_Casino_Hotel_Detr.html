<p>The popular in-demand studio offering engaging online slots for the iGaming vertical, Swintt, announced a new deal that will significantly expand the reach of its content. On Wednesday, the company confirmed it signed a new content distribution agreement with the leading online gambling operator, Mobile Incorporated (Mobinc).</p>
<p>The freshly minted collaboration sees Swintt's games reach new markets and audiences. Under the terms of the deal, the popular slots games provider agreed to deliver its content for Mobinc's brands Conquestador and JackWin.</p>
<p>Currently, the two brands have a well-established presence in different strategic markets across Europe. Additionally, JackWin and Conquestador operate in more markets thanks to their Malta license. This reaffirms their strong presence within the iGaming vertical. Now, thanks to the deal with Swintt, the two brands will deliver engaging slots for their customers around the world.</p>
<p>Mobinc's Casino Manager, Alex Bolton, shared his excitement about the recent collaboration in a statement saying: "The quality and variety of our content offering is the key to our success, and we are always looking to improve this with the addition of world-class studios."</p>
<p>He acknowledged the innovative casino games that Swintt delivers and predicted that their content will be well-received by the players of the two brands. Finally, Bolton said: "It's great that we can now have these titles available for our players, offering them a truly sensational casino experience."</p>
<p>Lars Kollind, Swintt's Head of Business Development, was similarly delighted about the deal signed with Mobinc. He said: "We are always looking for ways to increase the distribution of our games and this partnership with MobInc allows us to do just that."</p>
<p>Kollind acknowledged that the brands JackWin and Conquestador are trusted and have established presence in different markets. Additionally, he said that Swintt will be delighted to see its games go live for the two brands.</p>
<p>Speaking about the company's portfolio of games, the Head of Business Development acknowledged that Swintt has a wide array of games that many players can find appealing. Last but not least, Kollind said: "From explosive video slots to those that stir a sense of nostalgia, there is a Swintt game for everyone."</p>
<p>The collaboration with Mobinc comes on the heels of another multi-jurisdictional deal announced by Swintt. Recently, the company joined forces with the globally-recognized gambling operator, Betsson Group. Under the terms of the partnership, Swintt agreed to supply its content, powering the Group's operations in strategic iGaming markets such as Latvia, Malta, Germany and Sweden. Besides expanding Betsson's offering, the deal helped boost significantly the reach of the titles provided by the fast-growing software provider.</p>
