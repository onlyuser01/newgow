<p>Prepare to hunt ferocious wild animals in prehistoric times in 4ThePlayer’s latest slot, 10,000 BC DoubleMax. The supplier’s latest title, available exclusively via Yggdrasil, launches today after a short trial as an exclusive game.</p>
<p>10,000 BC DoubleMax Metrics</p>
<p>Rows: 5</p>
<p>5 Reels: 5</p>
<p>5 Paylines: 50</p>
<p>50 RTP: 96%</p>
<p>96% Volatility: Low</p>
<p>Low Min/Max Bet: 0.10/100</p>
<p>0.10/100 Max Win: x10,000</p>
<p>Multiple Mechanics Increase Chances to Win Big</p>
<p>The new game features a variety of symbols representing wild animals, such as wolves, bears, saber-toothed cats and, of course, mammoths. Players can collect these symbols in a variety of combinations to win prizes.</p>
<p>Engagement is further boosted by two of Yggdrasil’s most popular mechanics, namely DoubleMax and GigaBlox. The former sees every cascade double the total win multiplier. The GigaBlox mechanic, on the other hand, sometimes has the reels land on huge symbols that provide opportunities to score winning combinations.</p>
<p>In addition, the game has the unique Mammoth Explode and Mammoth Shuffle features. The first of the two causes a cascade when there are no wins remaining on the reels. Mammoth Shuffle, on the other hand, causes GigaBlox symbols on the right side of the grid to be shoved to the left by the mammoth, guaranteeing a win.</p>
<p>On each subsequent cascade, the GigaBlox reel will move back to the right, providing opportunities for further wins.</p>
<p>The Game Has an Engaging Free Spins Mode</p>
<p>10,000 BC DoubleMax also sports a free spins round that is activated when players collect bonus symbols represented by a stone spear. During free spins mode, players can also cause Mammoth Ram cascades and shuffles. In addition, the multiplier does not reset with each spin, allowing players to win huge prizes up to x10,000 their bet.</p>
<p>Players can also buy 7 free spins for 100 times their bet, triggering the bonus round instantly.</p>
<p>The launch of the new game was hailed by Mark McGinley, Yggdrasil’s chief gaming officer. He said that the game attests to the flexibility of his company’s mechanics, allowing them to engage players in a variety of ways. He said that he is excited to see players “reap the rewards” of the DoubleMax and GigaBlox mechanics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 4ThePlayer’s commercial &amp; marketing director, Henry McLean, promised an “electrifying excitement” for anyone who tries out the new game.</p>
<p>It’s a mammoth of a game, and we’ve packed it with our signature 4ThePlayer magic, immersive artwork, solid math, and thrilling features like the Mammoth Shuffle and Explode. Henry McLean, co-founder &amp; commercial and marketing director, 4ThePlayer</p>
<p>The launch of the new title comes a few weeks after 4ThePlayer allowed Livespins to use its content.</p>
