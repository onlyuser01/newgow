    <h1>Washington Dc Casino Best Casino In St Louis Crypto Casino No Deposit Bonus The Q Casino Casino Near</h1>

<p>I have won $100 off a No-Deposit After 3 weeks my Documents were approved and I had asked when I joined the site about any fees withdrawing and was told no fee on BTC withdraws. So I was told I need to make an initial deposit of $30 and play it 1x, I did that, then proceeded to withdraw the NDB winnings of $100. After about a week I got an email saying to manual send my BTC wallet and casino username info to another email where my BTC withdraw will be processed in 7-10 days through a 3rd party processing, It also stated in that email that there will be a FEE of $30 for processing of my $100 via BTC withdraw. Instantly I thought how is there such a high fee with the fact I was told there is no fee for BTC withdraws , Let ALONE there is only a blockchain fee and no 3rd party processing is that high of a fee. I asked the casino if there are BTC withdraw fees once more to verify and they said no fee , So then I told them well I got an email saying there will be a $30 fee to ask them about it and they dont have much of an answer for me they just said yeah theres a $30 fee. So it seems that the casino is just deciding to take $30 from my withdraw just because I won off a NDB . Can Someone please confirm this is a thing or if the casino is just taking money from my withdraw because I won free money and they just want to take $30 from it. It sure seems sketchy as if someone is just deciding to take money just because I won off the NDB. - Side note I am apparently being paid by the 10th which 100-30 is $70 total . just seems ridiculous or very sketchy they are taking so much money for a so called (MADE UP) fee.</p>
