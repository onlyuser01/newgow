<p>The Betting and Gaming Council used the opportunity to remind ministers that they ought to exercise moderation when reforming the sector</p>
<p>The Betting and Gaming Council in Britain has praised the new drop in problem gambling rates. However, the union believes that there is still more that can be done.</p>
<p>According to figures released by the United Kingdom’s Gambling Commission (UKGC) problem gambling harm rates have declined to 0.2%. This represents a noticeable drop from the 0.3% recorded a year ago. Despite that, these 0.2% are still a cause for concern among industry professionals.</p>
<p>Gambling harm is a staple topic of the gambling industry as companies and customers alike realize the need for a safe and sustainable ecosystem. With safer gambling in mind, many have lobbied for harsher regulations ahead of the upcoming white paper.</p>
<p>Others, on the other hand, claim that too restrictive changes might prompt players to play with unlicensed companies that fail to offer sufficient safeguards.</p>
<p>Dugher Once Again Calls for a Moderate Approach</p>
<p>Michael Dugher, the chief executive officer of the Betting and Gaming Council, addressed the new figures. He called them “further evidence of the positive progress” in terms of safer gambling. According to Dugher, the effectiveness of the current measures should be taken in mind, meaning that it would be best if ministers exercise moderation when introducing new rules.</p>
<p>These figures showing that problem gambling has fallen once again will no doubt come as a profound disappointment to anti-gambling prohibitionists, who like to vastly overstate the issue. Michael Dugher, CEO, BGC</p>
<p>Dugher slammed what he called “alarmists” for spreading misinformation that is not backed by evidence. He reasserted that big changes should target the vulnerable people instead of being blanket measures that would ruin the experience of everyone else.</p>
<p>Dugher added that the BGC remains committed to promoting safer gambling unlike the dangerous safeguard-free black market.</p>
<p>Ministers should not drive customers into the arms of the black market by introducing blanket low level intrusive affordability checks for all punters but rather use technology to target those at risk. Michael Dugher, CEO, BGC</p>
<p>Currently, almost half of the adults in Britain participate in some form of wagering. Thanks to that, the British gambling industry is able to contribute billions to the economy by paying taxes and creating and supporting new jobs.</p>
<p>The BGC is a body that believes gambling should be fun enough to enjoy but safe enough to prevent gambling harm. The commission agrees that even a problem gambling rate of 0.2%, which is an impressively low number compared to other jurisdictions, is too much. Because of that, the BGC will continue to raise standards while ensuring that the government doesn’t drive gamblers toward the notorious black market.</p>
