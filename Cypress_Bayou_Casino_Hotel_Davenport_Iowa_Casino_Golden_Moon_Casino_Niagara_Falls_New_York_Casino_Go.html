<p>PrizePicks, a leading player in the North American skill-based fantasy sports industry, has made several key hires to lead the company's legal, compliance, and government affairs initiatives</p>
<p>The company has filled positions on its executive team and it has also hired its first chief legal officer (CLO).</p>
<p>PrizePicks’ New CLO Jason Barclay Joins from Athletico</p>
<p>Among the new employees is the appointment of Jason Barclay as the company’s first chief legal officer and head of public policy. Barclay has an extensive background in the legal field, including serving as legal counsel to the governors of Indiana and Illinois.</p>
<p>He also has experience as a regulator, having served as the first Chairman of the Indiana Athletic Commission and sitting on the Indiana and Illinois Racing Boards and the Illinois State Board of Education.</p>
<p>Barclay will be a part of the Executive Leadership Team and will oversee all of PrizePicks’ government affairs, legal and compliance, and people-related operations.</p>
<p>Barclay said that he has been entrusted with two key missions: to construct the most robust compliance and responsible player programs in the industry, and to work closely with regulators to ensure that consumers are able to safely enjoy skill-based fantasy sports. He also noted that with the team that has been assembled, they are well-positioned to achieve success on behalf of the consumers.</p>
<p>William Guidera Brings Experience from Netflix and 21st Century Fox</p>
<p>In addition, William Guidera joins the organization as its new senior vice president of government affairs. Guidera brings a wealth of experience in the public affairs field, having served as the director of US federal and state public affairs at Netflix and senior vice president of public affairs at 21st Century Fox.</p>
<p>While at Netflix, Guidera formed and led a coalition that defeated harmful state streaming tax and regulatory legislation, and united an industry alliance to support state privacy legislation. At 21st Century Fox, he led an industry coalition that engaged Attorneys General on intellectual property rights and search engines.</p>
<p>Other new members of the PrizePicks team are Adam Packer, who will take the job of senior vice president of legal and compliance and John Pauley, who will become PrizePicks’s new vice president of government affairs.</p>
<p>We are extremely fortunate to have this seasoned group of business professionals lead our organization as we strive to become the most respected and consumer-friendly company in skills-based fantasy sports. This group of all-stars have spent a majority of their careers fighting for the consumer – a characteristic that is paramount to our success as a brand focused on always putting our members first. Adam Wexler. PrizePicks CEO</p>
<p>With the addition of these highly experienced individuals, PrizePicks is poised to continue to grow in the skill-based fantasy sports industry, while ensuring compliance and responsible player programs are top priorities.
