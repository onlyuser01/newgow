    <h1>Twin Pines Casino Casino Games Online That Pay Real Money Casino In Kansas Ballys Casino Chicago Bos</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I had my account opened around August 20th and started playing without any issues until today, November 2nd, when my account was abruptly closed.</p>
<p>Let's go back a few days to when I had a winning streak and began to make withdrawals.</p>
<p>The first two withdrawals went fine, but on the third one, they started asking for verification of the four credit cards I had used, along with my identification document.</p>
<p>The verification passed (it was stated as verified for each card and a green checkmark appeared next to the confirmation), yet despite this, my account was shut down claiming it was a duplicate account.</p>
<p>My name and phone number were registered only once. I cannot accept that my account gets closed without having the funds that were on it (€15,300 returned to me).</p>
