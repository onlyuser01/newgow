<p>Gamban, the company behind the self-exclusion software that allows users to block their access to over 1,000 gambling websites, announced a new partnership with The Problem Gambling Help Network of West Virginia.</p>
<p>Free Access to the Self-Exclusion Tool</p>
<p>The collaboration with the Problem Gambling Help Network of West Virginia, which employs over 70 referral therapists located statewide and has provided help to more than 15,000 people suffering from gambling addiction since 2000, will offer the Gamban app free of charge for anyone who accessed the problem gambling service.</p>
<p>“I am very pleased to be working with The Problem Gambling Help Network of West Virginia and happy that this partnership will provide an extra resource and layer of protection for those whose gambling has become a problem for them in West Virginia.” Melissa Etherington, Partnerships Manager, Gamban</p>
<p>The service, which already received nationwide recognition for its innovative approach to problem gambling, utilizes a network of therapists ready to refer people showing symptoms of gambling addiction to treatment, a 24-hour helpline and various support groups. It regularly organizes retreat weekends and other events, and provides training opportunities, prevention and outreach services.</p>
<p>“It is exciting to partner with Gamban to provide a valuable tool for so many. With more accessibility to online gambling, the benefits of Gamban software are immeasurable for those experiencing gambling problems.” Jennifer Davis-Walton, Director, Gambling Addiction Services, First Choice Services, Inc.</p>
<p>West Virginia is one of the states where problem gambling continues to be a serious public issue, as according to 2019 data provided by the National Council on Problem Gambling, every 1 out of 50 adult residents is at risk of having a gambling addiction, while WalletHub, a personal finance service, in a 2019 study on problem gambling ranked West Virginia 6th among the states with most gambling addicts.</p>
<p>GamBan Gaining Popularity</p>
<p>The GamBan software is becoming quite popular among gaming operators in the US, which see it as a viable option for their clients to self-exclude from gambling and prevent addictions.</p>
<p>It was Kindred Group, via its Unibet brand, which was the first operator to provide its customers access to the self-exclusion tool, after expanding on an existing partnership with GamBan dating back to 2017.</p>
<p>FanDuel, the fantasy sport and sportsbook brand of Flutter Entertainment in the US, followed suit and agreed on a partnership with GamBan to offer players the app free of charge and boost player protection.</p>
<p>Pinnacle, a sports betting operator, was among the latest to partner with GamBan and offer the software free of charge to its players as part of its commitment to player welfare.</p>
