<p>The leading provider of business-to-business and business-to-customer services and technology solutions for online gambling operators, Markor Technology, announced a major partnership ahead of the end of the year.</p>
<p>The company said Monday it joined forces with Relax Gaming, a leading provider of online casino games offering a variety of titles including proprietary slots, poker, bingo and other gambling products. Under the terms of the new deal, Markor Technology added leading titles from Relax Gaming to its gaming aggregation platform.</p>
<p>In a statement released on December 19, 2022, Nadiya Attard, Relax Gaming's CCO, said that the company is excited to deliver its leading games and expand Markor Technology's gaming aggregation platform offering. She added: "Despite only being founded a few years ago, the company has established itself as a top provider of aggregation services in the iGaming industry."</p>
<p>It was back in 2010 when Relax Gaming Group was founded. Since then, the company has been growing continuously and by now it offers access to more than 1000 online gambling games. Its products stand out with quality graphics and a "quick one-time integration."</p>
<p>Since it was founded more than a decade ago, growing within regulated markets was always a key goal for Relax Gaming. Currently, the company holds licenses in multiple jurisdictions including the UK, Romania, as well as Malta.</p>
<p>The new collaboration further expands the reach of the award-winning games offered by Relax Gaming. At the same time, the partnership reaffirms Markor Technology's leadership position as a global provider of B2C and B2B solutions and content. What's more, the new deal helps expand Markor Technology's portfolio and introduces new content for its growing customer base around the globe.</p>
<p>Melissa Summerfield, Markor Technology's CEO, shared her excitement about the new deal with Relax Gaming saying: "Markor Technology has rapidly built a reputation for being one of the industry's leading providers of game aggregation services â€“ and partnering with the biggest names in iGaming has undoubtedly been key to our growth."</p>
<p>Markor Technology was founded in 2020 and since then, it managed to prove its position as a leading provider of B2B and B2C solutions for iGaming operators. The company's partners benefit from accessing a multi-licensed player account management (PAM) system and multi-product offering.</p>
<p>The leading technology, Markor explains, can be customized based on the requirements of the operators. Those customization options make the processes more efficient for the operators and boost profits. By now, Markor Technology offers more than 5,000 titles from some of the most popular gaming suppliers via its leading content aggregation platform.</p>
