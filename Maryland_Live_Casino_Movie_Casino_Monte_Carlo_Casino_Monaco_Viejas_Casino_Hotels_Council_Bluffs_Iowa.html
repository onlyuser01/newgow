<p>Amigo Gaming, an innovative content provider that builds out-of-the-box experiences for the online casino sector, has announced a new alliance with iGP, a provider of iGaming technology suites that will allow the company to quickly inject its library of titles with a range of operators, helping third-party suppliers in the process.</p>
<p>Amigo Gaming is known for hits such as Frozen Crown, Jaguar Treasures, Miss Neko, Book of Sorcery, Punky Monkey, and so many others. The company will now use this alliance as a leg-up to reach even more audiences and make sure that its portfolio of slots is well-received by leading brands and their players.</p>
<p>iGP makes it easy for partner studios to reach operators, as it aggregates games and then distributes them among operators who sign up to use the company’s advanced infrastructure and support services. The result is frictionless and quick integration of wide swathes of gaming libraries without any downtime or slow-down.</p>
<p>iGP Sales Director Elliott Banks was happy about the opportunity to see another promising studio onboarded with his company’s infrastructure that will allow operators to benefit from excellent and player-favorite games.</p>
<p>"This is an exciting period for iGP, particularly for our aggregator team. Forging partnerships like this one is incredibly fulfilling, it brings their innovative vision to fruition, enhancing the way games reach end users," Banks noted.</p>
<p>The opportunity was naturally welcomed by Amigo Gaming Director of Business Development Marga Fernández who was similarly pleased to be giving her company another boost through iGP. She hailed the chance to see this partnership broaden the studio’s reach and with one of the leading platform providers no less.</p>
<p>iGP has been actively strengthening its executive team in the meantime, with the company appointing Dirk Camilleri as Chief Product Officer earlier this month. Camilleri is also a seasoned industry veteran whose nous and prowess in the sector will now give iGP a fresh boost.</p>
<p>Amigo Games is a company that features more than 63 slot games, which are developed to be fast, innovative, and have their own distinct signature style. Players are welcome to dive into any of the modern hits, or try some of the more established classics, such as Viking’s Quest or Book of Jurassic, among dozens of others, of course.</p>
