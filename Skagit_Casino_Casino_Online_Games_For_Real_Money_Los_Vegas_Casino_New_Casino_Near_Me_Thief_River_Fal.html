    <h1>Skagit Casino Casino Online Games For Real Money Los Vegas Casino New Casino Near Me Thief River Fal</h1>

<p>I deposited 20EUR and won 150EUR which I tried to withdraw to the same card.</p>
<p>I sent all of my documents to verify my account which were accepted. I then got an email to say that my withdrawal was accepted and that they tried to pay it out to my bank account which was declined. A transaction of 150EURO is showing as declined l, by my bank, however they say they do not know why.</p>
<p>my account balance has now doubled to 300EUR which makes no sense and I am being asked to withdraw to a different method which is against the terms and conditions. I contacted live chat support who said that my account balance is definitely 300EURO available. I’m worried they are going to say I’m doing something wrong and stop my winnings</p>
