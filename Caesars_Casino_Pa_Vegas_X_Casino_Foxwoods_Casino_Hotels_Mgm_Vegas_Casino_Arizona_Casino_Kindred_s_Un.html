<p>Kindred Group plc’s Unibet brand has chosen Optimove as its new provider of CRM marketing solutions to help it grow through premium player-led marketing strategies</p>
<p>Kindred Group, the worldwide leading online gambling operator with business spread across North America, Australia, and Europe, has announced an important partnership agreement with Optimove, the number one customer relationship management (CRM) marketing solution provider for the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the new deal, Optimove will help Kindred’s flagship brand, Unibet, grow through proven player-led marketing strategies and process optimization.</p>
<p>Kindred to Use Optimove’s Full Suite</p>
<p>The decision will help Kindred continue its strategic plan to invest in scaling retention marketing solutions while maximizing player lifetime value as a crucial driver for growth.</p>
<p>The group will rely on Optimove’s scientific approach embedded in its CRM Marketing solution to better evaluate and attribute the incremental value of each player interaction while boosting its efficiency from an operational standpoint.</p>
<p>For this, Kindred will employ Optimove’s complete suite encompassing mobile, SMS, and email marketing channels, and benefit from personalized experiences via Opti-X. This is Optimove’s Digital Experience Platform that customizes digital experiences by mixing more than 20 artificial intelligence models with business rules.</p>
<p>Unibet will also get access to unified customer profiles featuring predictive, historical, as well as real-time customer data from a variety of sources including service clouds, CRM, service clouds, and data warehouses.</p>
<p>This will help them generate comprehensive single-customer views that can be accessed by CRM Marketing teams.</p>
<p>The group will also enter an ongoing optimization loop by using Optimove’s productized experimentation tools meant to assess the incremental uplift of each new strategy and campaign. This will help it optimize its CRM marketing performance.</p>
<p>Finally, Kindred will benefit from multichannel customization and seamless orchestration of campaigns with the help of Optimove’s CRM Journeys mapped by AI and meant to provide personalized customer communications across all types of channels.</p>
<p>“A Powerful Alliance”</p>
<p>Optimove’s vice president of revenue, gaming, Motti Colman, called Kindred “a true leader in iGaming committed to delivering an exceptional customer experience to their players”.</p>
<p>Colman also described the new partnership as a “powerful alliance”, saying they were honored for being chosen while expressing their appreciation for the group’s confidence in their capabilities.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kindred’s director of retention marketing, Dan Gabay, took the opportunity to express their certainty regarding Optimove’s contribution to their nonstop efforts to improve players’ experiences via “personalized and timely customer messages that align with the speed of player interactions”.</p>
<p>Toward the end of January, the premier lottery and sports-betting operator in France, La Française des Jeux, announced its big plans to acquire the Kindred Group for around $2.5 billion.</p>
