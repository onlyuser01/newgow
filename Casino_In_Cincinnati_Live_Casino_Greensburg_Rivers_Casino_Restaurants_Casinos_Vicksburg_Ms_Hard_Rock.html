    <h1>Casino In Cincinnati Live Casino Greensburg Rivers Casino Restaurants Casinos Vicksburg Ms Hard Rock</h1>

<p>UK self-exclusion specialist Gamban announced today its software which blocks access to websites offering online gambling and financial trading is now available in Spanish and to residents from all Spanish speaking countries.</p>
<p>Expanding the Software’s Reach</p>
<p>The news that the software which blocks gamblers from reaching over 1,000 gambling websites is now available in Spanish further increased the company’s global reach as the Spanish language is native to the second largest population worldwide.</p>
<p>Hailing the importance of having their services available to Spanish natives so that it is “accessible to as many people harmed by gambling as possible,” Gamban chief executive officer Jack Symons focused on how much the company had grown since its launch more than 6 years ago, to establish itself as the standard-setter in gambling blocking software</p>
<p>“Gamban is used by thousands of people worldwide, and we’ve received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback, with some users informing the team that it has literally saved their life. Taking the first step continues to be the hardest challenge and much of our time goes into making Gamban as simple and straightforward to install as possible.” Jack Symons, CEO, Gamban</p>
<p>Gamban’s expansion into Spanish speaking countries and populations is introduced at a time when Spain’s markets and competition authority Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC) is openly supporting new regulations for safer gambling.</p>
<p>Strengthening Position in Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>Gamban has already affirmed its position in the UK, working with the self-exclusion scheme GAMSTOP and leading treatment provider GamCare to offer free access to its TalkBanStop.com website for those who have suffered from gambling harm.</p>
<p>Independent research commissioned in 2018 by GambleAware, the UK charity propagating responsible gambling, seeking to evaluate blocking software and existing alternative products, ranked Gamban as the most effective and ensured it is provided free of charge throughout all GamCare support networks in the country.</p>
<p>Gamban is also free of charge in Norway after the software developer signed a partnership with the country’s state-owned lottery and gaming operator Norsk Tipping.</p>
<p>In the US, the software company partnered with some of the major sports betting and online gaming operators, including DraftKings, FanDuel, and Unibet, to provide its blocking software. Recently, Gamban was recently added to Paypal’s online payment settlement services.</p>
<p>The software company that won the Software Rising Star Award at the 2019 EGR B2B Awards and the Reg Tech Provider of the Year at the Gambling Compliance Global Regulatory Awards, insists the blocking software was never intended to work as a standalone solution: hence, its team continues to explore options to connect it with other schemes, tools and initiatives to ensure a higher rate of gambling addiction recovery.</p>
