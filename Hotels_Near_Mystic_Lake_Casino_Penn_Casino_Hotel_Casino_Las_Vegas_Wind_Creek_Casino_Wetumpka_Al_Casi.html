    <h1>Hotels Near Mystic Lake Casino Penn Casino Hotel Casino Las Vegas Wind Creek Casino Wetumpka Al Casi</h1>

<p>I made a â‚¬20 deposit to megaslot.com casino on 17.03.2022 using trustly. Of course, the money left my bank account, but for some reason it never entered my game account. I have been in contact with customer service regarding my missing deposit and I have sent them screenshots of my payments taken from the bank's website. I have also been in contact with trustly, which confirmed that I have saved megaslot to the casino twice successfully. I received the reference numbers from trustly which I had to provide to megaslot casino customer support with which they would apparently be able to find my missing deposit. I have now had to wait two weeks and they still haven't put the missing deposit into my game account or returned that money to my bank account. Every time I contact customer service I only get the same answer that they need more time to fix my problem with the deposit. You would think that they would find out in two weeks, especially since I provided the reference numbers I received from trustly for those transfers, but apparently not. I think the money will go that way. I wonder how it can take so long to add one missing deposit to my game account. However, I have sent them the pictures taken from the bank's website of my deposits to that casino and the reference numbers that I got from trustly, so according to trustly, those deposits can be found immediately with the reference numbers that they gave me. I guess this casino is pulling me by the nose and badly. Sometimes I also feel that when I send an e-mail, it's as if a computer is answering instead of employees, because the answers are always the same except for small differences. I hope that they will add that deposit to my game account or return the money to my bank account, but it seems that hope is in vain. I will definitely not deposit at megaslot.com casino ever again and I will warn others about this casino as well.</p>
