<p>888 Holdings, the parent company of several betting and casino brands such as 888sport, 888casino, and 888poker, has been approved to launch in the Ontario market in Canada.</p>
<p>888 Holdings Extends Its Reach</p>
<p>888 Holdings has been granted an official license to operate in the jurisdiction by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario. Now the company will prepare for the launch of Ontario’s regulated gambling market which is scheduled for April 4 this year.</p>
<p>Ontario is a key region for 888 Holdings and it hopes to achieve notable success in the province. The budding Canadian markets have proven to be highly appealing to many gambling companies. By securing a license ahead of the market launch, 888 Holdings also secures a head start that will help it rise above many of its competitors.</p>
<p>The operator plans to provide a varied suite of offerings to the local bettors. 888 Holdings is sure that it can conquer the province thanks to its strong expertise in the field. It has experience in both casino games and sports betting and will seek to grab the hearts of the Ontarian punters with offerings tailored to their needs. 888 Holdings is sure that its gambling products will appeal to the Canadian betting demographics and is looking forward to the launch.</p>
<p>Ontario Holds Potential for Long-Term Growth</p>
<p>Itai Pazner, the chief executive officer of 888 Holdings, spoke about the license, saying that he is delighted by the opportunities that wait in Ontario. He thanked the AGCO, saying that he is thrilled to have 888 Holdings approved and can’t wait to launch the company’s offerings on the fresh Ontarian market. The CEO added that he can’t be happier for the launch.</p>
<p>“As we prepare for launch in the coming weeks, we are excited to bring all of 888’s leading products and games to new audiences across the province, providing our unique and differentiated experiences to players.” 888 Holdings CEO Itai Pazner</p>
<p>Pazner noted that strengthening the company’s presence in key regulated markets is 888 Holdings’ main goal. He elaborated that this is why Ontario is so attractive – it provides huge opportunities for sustained long-term growth which is exactly what 888 Holdings is looking for.</p>
<p>888 Holdings continues to steadily grow its business. The company saw a notable increase in revenue during 2021, despite the troubled times and the underperforming fourth quarter. The company has demonstrated that it is capable of withstanding challenges. It was recently handed a $12.6 million fine by the British Gambling Commission but continues to stand strong and work to improve its business.</p>
