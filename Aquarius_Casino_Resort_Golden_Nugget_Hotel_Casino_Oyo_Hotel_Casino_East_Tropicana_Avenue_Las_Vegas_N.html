    <h1>Aquarius Casino Resort Golden Nugget Hotel Casino Oyo Hotel Casino East Tropicana Avenue Las Vegas N</h1>

<p>Sadly, until we rid the world of rogue casino operators everyone is being put at risk.</p>
<p>The Curaçao (GCB) has started implementing a ‘long overdue’ Licensing reform! (see my post further up)</p>
<p>I researched the commercial companies that showed on my bank statement for deposits and contacted them to ask for my money back. I managed to recoup over £600. I have to emphasise, I was not a sore loser, but moreover, I took exception to playing, on what I now know as, ‘untrustworthy casinos’.</p>
<p>I have spent hundreds of hours looking into this and there is much to do. If unscrupulous casinos can be stopped legislatively that would be great but essentially PLAYERS MUST EXERCISE CAUTION!</p>
<p>I have found, it is not until players start looking into rogue operators (usually after substantial losses) they suddenly realise something is terribly wrong in the gambling industry!</p>
<p>‘Addicts’ and/or the ‘vulnerable’ won’t be looking for reasons NOT to register, how then do we put a safety net around them!?</p>
<p>We can push hard for legislation reforms but so much more needs to be done! There will always be deceitful people out there but having a license (or not! as is the case with many operators) to print money MUST have serious consequences, especially because the lack of social responsibility is breaking lives and hearts!</p>
