<p>1 win my money no deposit bonus</p>
<p>2 I asked for an explanation and at that moment he had answered me the following</p>

<p>This is not the case and I clarify the situation. It took me 3 months to verify my account and every time I wanted to withdraw my money they always canceled the withdrawal of the minimum of 1000 euros since their terms allowed me to withdraw 1000 euros every 24 hours. They canceled the withdrawal and I asked support for explanations and they lied to me that it was problems with the payment system of the page, so I kept trying until they notified me that I had to make a video call, I asked them why if my account was already 100 percent verified cent (image that I attached where it shows the verification confirmed by mail) so I agreed I had no problem accepting the video call in order to be able to collect, and here again the fraud requested that they make me a video call in Spanish I don't know English, so When they called me, they were very long and complex questions in English and I only know the basics. My mother tongue is Spanish. I asked them to please speak slowly so I could try to translate and be able to answer the questions with my voice speaking in English. This led me to Trying to understand what they were asking me, I noticed the poor attention and the purpose of creating confusion to understand that in the verification I did not answer the questions correctly when in reality I answered everything, so they blocked my account, also observe guru as later at the end of the message They tell me to accept that I breached on purpose so that they give me 225 euros, you can see the bribe that they imply for me to accept so as not to give me what corresponds to me, which is the 10,000 euros. profits and disrespected me I gave them everything</p>
