<p>Aristocrat Leisure, the leading provider of gaming solutions, announced that Friday will be the last day for its current chief financial officer (CFO).</p>
<p>Aristocrat to Part Ways with Current CFO</p>
<p>The company has announced that Julie Cameron-Doe, who is currently serving as CFO will step down effective from this Friday, April 15, 2022. It was back in December last year when Aristocrat announced the resignation of Cameron-Doe. At the time, the company confirmed that she will keep the position of CFO for six months to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>After Friday, Cameron-Doe’s position will be filled by Sally Denby, who is currently serving as deputy CFO. Before the leadership position, Denby has served as a general manager of the group finance team between February 2018 and January 2022. Overall, she was a part of Aristocrat for more than seven years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cameron-Doe was a part of Aristocrat for more than 8 years. During her tenure, she has taken key leadership roles such as CFO, group general manager of finance as well as general manager of planning and finance. Cameron-Doe has deep knowledge of e-commerce and media businesses and has more than two decades of experience in the industry. She has a proven track record in rebuilding confidence and turning around financial teams as a part of public and privately held international businesses. Leaving Aristocrat, Cameron-Doe will take a similar role with the gaming giant Wynn Resorts.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Besides Cameron-Doe, Aristocrat announced additional changes to its senior leadership team recently. Back in February, the company said that Hector Fernandez was selected as the new CEO of Aristocrat Gaming, the company’s team that is focused on land-based gaming and services.</p>
<p>“Julie has been an exceptional partner to me and the leadership group over the past four years, as Aristocrat’s scale, diversity, resilience and cultural growth has accelerated.” Trevor Croker, CEO and managing director at Aristocrat</p>
<p>Upon announcing the planned departure of the current CFO, Aristocrat’s CEO, Trevor Croker, acknowledged that Cameron-Doe helped the company grow in the last four years. Moreover, he outlined that after many successful years with Aristocrat, he respects Cameron-Doe’s decision to take on a new path.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to achieve this long-term agreement with IGT, which is highly aligned to Aristocrat’s established and successful IP strategy.” Trevor Croker, CEO and managing director at Aristocrat</p>
<p>Today, the company also announced that it entered into a 10-year patent cross-licensing agreement with the global gaming leader, IGT. The company said that the collaboration “covers a wide range of utility and hardware design patents.” On that topic, Croker added that the Aristocrat is delighted to ink the deal with IGT.</p>
