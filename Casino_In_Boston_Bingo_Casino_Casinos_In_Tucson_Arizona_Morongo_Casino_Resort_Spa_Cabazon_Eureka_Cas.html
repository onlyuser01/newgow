<p>Global supplier of gaming technology Scientific Games (SG) announced today a new business partnership that will enhance its online casino games portfolio in North America.</p>
<p>Enhance Product Offering</p>
<p>Scientific Games and Design Works Gaming (DWG) reached a 3-year exclusive agreement that will see a wide range of the Arizona-based DWG game portfolio rolled out across Canada and the US via SG’s OpenGaming aggregation platform. The partnership will initially see DWG’s game content offered to operators in New Jersey, followed shortly after with launches in Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as other states that have legalized already or will legalize in the future online casino gaming.</p>
<p>Securing this exclusive deal with DWG furthers our momentum across North America. DWG has a wealth of knowledge on what players in the region want from their gaming experiences and the addition of their content significantly enhances the product offering operators can put in front of players. It is a perfect alliance, and we look forward to working and growing together.” Steve Mayes, Partnerships Director, Digital, Scientific Games</p>
<p>Players at brands that utilize the OpenGaming aggregation platform will be able to enjoy first-hand the unique and diverse content supplied by DWG, which built a name for itself with a successful track record working with land-based gaming establishments to become a trusted developer of iGaming content with a mix of game releases like steppers, video slots and scratch cards.</p>
<p>Dreams Do Become Reality</p>
<p>Speaking about the deal, DWG CEO Troy Zurawski outlined the path followed by the company he founded in pursuit of the dream to launch “games in regulated, real money online casinos in the US” from the moment of its inception, building slow and steady but “with purpose.”</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine, it feels incredible to be launching in the USA. Even more so, knowing the proven success behind our products. We couldn’t have found a better partner to bring us home than Scientific Games. With their backing – we can now change up the game across North America, starting with this first launch in New Jersey.” Troy Zurawski, CEO, Design Works Gaming</p>
<p>The exclusive content deal with DWG further boosts SG’s product offering to operators and affirms the leading content role of the OpenGaming platform as an ecosystem that is constantly growing its appeal for new iGaming and lottery operators.</p>
<p>Outside of the US, the OpenGaming aggregation platform debuted in Colombia last month via a partnership with Betsson Group and its local sports betting and iGaming brand Colbet.</p>
