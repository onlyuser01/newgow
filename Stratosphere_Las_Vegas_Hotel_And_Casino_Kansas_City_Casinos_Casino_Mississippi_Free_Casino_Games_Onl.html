<p>OKTO has negotiated a new partnership with Light &amp; Wonder, a global leader in the delivery of games across a number of verticals. The partnership covers the cashless payment solutions developed by OKTO which will be available for a number of game machines that are developed by Light &amp; Wonder, including the AGC, LBO, bingo, and casino sectors in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Commenting on the success of this partnership, OKTO CCO Simon Dorsen welcomed the opportunity for his company to showcase its expertise and demonstrate the performance and integrity of the OKTO payment system, along with what the executive described as its unlimited capabilities.</p>

<p>Light &amp; Wonder remains one of the leading companies in the gambling and gaming industries, and Dorsen confirmed that his company was excited to be empowering the machines delivered by the new partner. OKTO’s payment platform though is not just limited to technological superiority or convenience as it also focuses on responsible gambling and overall regulatory compliance and security. Dorsen explained:</p>
<p>OKTO payment platform is fully equipped with a safer gambling toolkit as well as a powerful RegTech API that manages all KYC, AML, and fraud queries, providing all the features that enable operators to remain compliant and uphold the highest standards of social responsibility.

<p>Light &amp; Wonder was similarly thrilled with the announcement and the company’s VP of product management, Wayne Ellard, said that the firm was constantly looking to innovate its proposition and add value for customers and players. Ellard added:</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with OKTO, integrating with their platform to enable our customers to take advantage of their cashless payment solution. Light &amp; Wonder VP of product management, Wayne Ellard,</p>
<p>Ellard confirmed that Light &amp; Wonder is particularly well focused on player protection and has been involved in creating some of the industry’s leading tools committed to safeguarding customers across different jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>“We look forward to enabling this innovative cashless capability for our UK customers by the end of this year,” Ellard concluded. OKTO has been securing a string of similar partnerships with some of the most prominent stakeholders in the industry. A recent partnership with Hippodrome Casino was struck in June and involved the deployment of the OKTO.WALLET. OKTO also has a partnership with Codere and a number of other prominent names in the gambling industry.</p>
