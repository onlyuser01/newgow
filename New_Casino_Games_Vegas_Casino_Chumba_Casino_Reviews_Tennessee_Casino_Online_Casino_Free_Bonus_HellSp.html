    <h1>New Casino Games Vegas Casino Chumba Casino Reviews Tennessee Casino Online Casino Free Bonus HellSp</h1>

<p>I started an account with Hellspin Casino.</p>
<p>I made my first deposit of $100 and was issued a deposit bonus of $100</p>
<p>When I started to play, I had a winning streak &amp; never dipped into the $100 of bonus money.</p>
<p>(all of my wagers were under 5$)</p>
<p>I was up around $1500 and I messaged support and inquired about cancelling the bonus early to see if there was any leftover for real money- they indicated that that I would lose all the funds.</p>
<p>So I went back to the casino and started playing again, and my winning streak continued.</p>
<p>I was up over 2000$</p>
<p>I checked the bonus status &amp; it indicated that I only had to wager a little bit more before the bonus became real money.</p>
<p>So, I increased my wagers to over $10 in an effort to help me convert the funds into real money.</p>
<p>Shortly after, I ended my wagering requirements with $3000 in real money, so I went to withdraw the funds &amp; I thought everything was fine.</p>
<p>The next day I wake up to an email from HELLSPIN advising me that they’ve confiscated my winnings because I violated their terms… according to the terms, it says you are not allowed to wager more then 5$ when there is an active bonus.</p>
<p>Although 80% of my wagers were within the 5$ limit… they took away 100% of the funds.</p>
<p>There was nothing stopping me from making these higher bets, no warning, no due diligence on their end… I fell right into their trap.</p>
<p>I pleaded with them to work with me… at least to bring me back to the point where I was prior to making higher bets, but they just kept saying no.</p>
<p>Please help- this is unfair and deceptive</p>
