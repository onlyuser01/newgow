<p>Baccarat’s popularity among gaming enthusiasts has been increasing drastically over the years. The game originated from Europe, and for the past few decades, it was mostly popular only in Asia, but it has been spreading worldwide year after year since. In Las Vegas, for example, Baccarat was only responsible for about 18% of the total revenue from table games in 2012. This increased to 33% in 2013, then 45% in 2014. And of course, with the growth of revenue, Baccarat tables filled up more spots all over the Vegas Strip casinos. In Macau, more than 88% of the casinos’ total revenue was generated from Baccarat in 2017!</p>
<p>So the question has to be asked: what is the hype about? Why is Baccarat so popular? Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Simplicity</p>
<p>Baccarat’s rules are very easy to comprehend. Quite frankly, one doesn’t even have to know the rules to play Baccarat. Players simply have to bet on either the ‘Player’s Hand’ or ‘Banker’s Hand’, then sit back while the game plays out. The object of the game is to choose a hand that is closer to nine, but this is not significant at all, because the cards are dealt according to a set of rules which cannot be changed. So even without knowing the details about the scoring system, anyone can start playing Baccarat and have the same chance of winning as experienced gamblers. Of course, there are other bet options on the table, such as Tie and Pair, but they are considered more of a side bet, plus they are extremely easy to comprehend as well(their names are self-explanatory).</p>
<p>Fast Game Play</p>
<p>This relates back to the simplicity of Baccarat. There are very few areas to decide where to place a bet: Player’s Hand or Banker’s Hand, a Tie, and Pairs. After placing an initial bet to start the game, no action or decision is required afterward on the player’s end. This allows players to relax and enjoy the game without having to do tiresome decision-making. On top of that, only 4~6 cards are dealt each game, which is automatically decided by set stone rules, thus making the gameplay super fast.</p>
<p>High Odds Winning</p>
<p>Perhaps the most attractive trait of all, Baccarat is well-known for its high odds of winning. The house edge for betting on the Player’s Hand is 1.24%, while Banker’s Hand is a mere 1.06%, giving players a favorable odds of winning. One of the Forbes articles states, "What makes baccarat dangerous for casinos is that, due to the large amounts of money bet and the thin house edge, players have the potential to win serious money at the casino’s expense." This is the reason why serious gamblers, who play for money rather than for fun and entertainment, tend to spend a great deal of their time at a Baccarat table.</p>
<p>Baccarat at Peergame</p>
<p>Baccarat, upon launch on Peergame, was extremely popular with chips placed by many gamers stacked up high as a kite on the table. Since then, it has always been a favorite for certain gamers, who tend to play Baccarat only. We have received generous praises from them about the game, especially our neat Statistics display that our gamers love and utilize. To thank those fans, we have launched a new slick look, so head over to the Baccarat table and enjoy a simple, yet well-paying popular card game, whilst enjoying the new design.</p>
<p>Always remember to play responsibly. Good luck!</p>
