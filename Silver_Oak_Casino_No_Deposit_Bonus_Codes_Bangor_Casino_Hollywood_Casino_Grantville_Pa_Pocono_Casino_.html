<p>Information about Paysera casinos</p>
<p>PaySera is a Fintech company based in Lithuania. Its range of products includes a payment gateway for e-shops, an app, money transfers, currency conversion, and even an event ticketing platform.</p>
<p>This payment method is also accepted in several PaySera online casinos as a way to make a deposit. You can read how to find these sites on this page, as well as the pros and cons of the company's service, how to make a PaySera deposit, and how to find PaySera casino bonuses.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>PaySera: a Lithuanian startup with many services, including online casino deposits.</p>
<p>PaySera began its journey in Vilnius, Lithuania back in 2004. This was a time of big growth in the online payments industry: PayPal had just replaced mailing checks and bank transfers as eBay's dominant payment method, proving that digital payments were now the best option for internet purchases.</p>
<p>The online revolution had begun. Startups all around the world took inspiration, and PaySera joined the party under its original name 'Elektroniniai verslo projektai': later shortened to EVP International. With just three employees, it launched an SMS payment service, now known as LightSMS.</p>
<p>In 2010, the company started its payment gateway PaySera Checkout, an innovation that would help them become Lithuania's first enterprise to earn an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) License (issued by the national bank) two years later.</p>
<p>In 2014, and with a 50-strong workforce, PaySera became the first Lithuanian company to offer QR payments to its customers. It now also had a fully functioning mobile app for users.</p>
<p>Since then, PaySera has continued to grow. It has over 300 employees based in several European countries, and Algeria. It's available on Google, Android and Samsung Pay, is part of the SEPA Instant Payments System, and even offers customers the chance to trade in gold.</p>
<p>We can safely say that PaySera is an established payment method, but what's it like to use its service? Read the next section to find out.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of PaySera</p>
<p>As an EMI-licensed company, PaySera is duty-bound to provide a secure payment service, but it has its positives and negatives like any other provider.</p>
<p>Positives</p>
<p>It's extremely safe</p>
<p>PaySera has all its procedures checked and audited by the Bank of Lithuania, which ensures transparency and impeccable behavior. As well as the standard security measures for providers of this kind, it also offers 3-D Secure Protocol for its cards, which gives card payments an extra layer of protection.</p>
<p>Payments should be instant</p>
<p>Fintech payment methods like to stand out from traditional banks by offering instant payments at no extra charge. PaySera is one of these, so you should expect your funds to arrive at their intended destination right away.</p>
<p>Free registration and no transfer fees</p>
<p>Setting up your PaySera account is free, and you should also be able to make payments for nothing. This is another typical feature of Fintech providers.</p>
<p>Negatives</p>
<p>There are ATM withdrawal fees</p>
<p>Every time you withdraw money from an ATM using a PaySera card, you'll have to pay a fee. At the time of writing (February 2022), this is €1 per operation for a Euro withdrawal in an EU country, and can be as much as €1.50 plus a 1.8% currency conversion charge if you withdraw a non-Euro currency in the EU, or any money outside the EU.</p>
<p>While many companies do this to cover costs, it can amount to a significant fee for large withdrawals. Taking out €1,000 in the USA, for example, would cost you £19.50, according to PaySera's own website info.</p>
<p>Fee charges for inactive accounts</p>
<p>PaySera's terms also make it clear that inactive accounts will be charged a monthly maintenance fee after lying dormant for two years. While this is standard procedure for many businesses, PaySera doesn't make it clear how much this is. If you sign up, or are an active user, and this concerns you, we recommend you ask PaySera about this.</p>
<p>How to use PaySera in online casinos</p>
<p>If you're looking to make a deposit into your chosen PaySera casino, then the process shouldn't take long at all. Just make sure that you have your payment login details to hand and that your casino account is fully open and verified. Then, do the following:</p>
<p>Go to the casino's Banking page and select PaySera as the deposit method Enter the deposit amount and your PaySera log-in details Double-check all the details are correct Click confirm.</p>
<p>Like most Fintech methods, you should expect PaySera to put the funds in your account right away. Should you wait much longer, then we advise you to contact PaySera or the casino to check that everything is OK.</p>
<p>You can also make PaySera withdrawals, if you wish. To do this, follow the same process as above except you choose PaySera as the cashout method. Withdrawals could take a few working days to reflect in your account and may be subject to charges from the casino.</p>
<p>Finding the best PaySera casino for you</p>
<p>At Casino Guru, our number one priority is ensuring that casino players have the safest gambling experience possible. PaySera's commitment to security means their payments are safe, and we need to ensure the casinos supporting it are, too.</p>
<p>This page will guide you towards the best PaySera casinos. Casino Guru's rating and review system gives each site a special Safety Index, which is based on several objective factors. These include:</p>
<p>The number of complaints it has received</p>
<p>The size of the casino</p>
<p>The quality of its related casinos</p>
<p>For the best online casinos, you can use the 'Recommended' tab to see the PaySera sites with the highest ratings. We encourage you to start with these.</p>
<p>The 'Newly opened' tab will let you see the most recent PaySera casinos on our database. While these won't be as established as the recommended sites, you might just uncover a hidden gem that is about to go on to great things.</p>
<p>Other filters to narrow down your search further include:</p>
<p>Game Provider</p>
<p>Perhaps you're a fan of a specific developer, like Blueprint Gaming. This filter will show you just the sites that offer their games, as well as PaySera.</p>
<p>Licenses</p>
<p>PaySera is regulated by a national authority, but how about the online casino? This box will show you licensed casinos such as MGA casinos, casinos with Kahnawake license, or Curaçao casinos.</p>

<p>Is roulette the game you're looking for? Or maybe you'd like to play real-money slots? Look for them with this list.</p>
<p>Note: If you're curious to know even more about the casino search process, then take a look at our How to choose an online casino article. You'll find every last detail of the process here – let's make bad casinos a thing of the past.</p>
<p>PaySera casino bonuses</p>
<p>Bonuses are an important part of the online casino industry as they can help both the site and the player enjoy a fruitful relationship. Deposit bonuses – free credit or spins you get after making a payment – can be a nice extra, while no deposit bonuses – the freebie you get just for registering – might be a small amount, but it literally costs you nothing.</p>
<p>Several PaySera casinos offer bonuses: the only question is finding the best ones. You can start by going to our list of casino bonuses, and ticking the 'PaySera' box. Then you can select your preferred type: to see deposit bonuses, for example, just choose 'Deposit Bonus' in the 'Bonus Type' section. For the same offers, you can also go to our list of deposit bonuses and choose 'PaySera' from the 'Payment Method' list there.</p>
<p>Any PaySera bonus that you find should be ready for you to use; the Casino Guru team works regularly to keep the list updated.</p>
