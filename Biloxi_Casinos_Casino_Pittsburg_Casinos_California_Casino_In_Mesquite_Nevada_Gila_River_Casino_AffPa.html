    <h1>Biloxi Casinos Casino Pittsburg Casinos California Casino In Mesquite Nevada Gila River Casino AffPa</h1>

<p>The one-stop portal for everything related to the affiliate side of iGaming business, AffPapa, has announced that it is adding Levon Nikoghosyan, CEO at PartnerMatrix, as a member of the company’s board of directors.</p>
<p>This comes after the two companies signed a share acquisition agreement with AffPapa and follows AffPapa’s recent string of successes in the industry.</p>
<p>The company revealed several ambitious projects over the past weeks and months, specifically the AffPapa iGaming Awards, which have proven their value and merit with industry stakeholders, along with the iGaming Club series, which focuses on additional networking opportunities hosted by the company.</p>
<p>Nikoghosyan is an important industry veteran with more than 10 years of relevant iGaming experience. He has had stints with BetConstruct and EveryMatrix and has worked at PartnerMatrix since 2015. Commenting on his appointment, Nikoghosyan said:</p>
<p>"I’m really grateful for this opportunity to tie up myself with AffPapa, a rapidly growing iGaming startup with a very promising future. I hope my contribution will strengthen its positions even more and amplify the pace of growth towards diversification of its portfolio of iGaming services."</p>
<p>AffPapa co-founder Chris Chandler also welcomed the new addition and said that Nikoghosyan was everything the board needed – an experienced leader with a demonstrated track record for producing results. Nikoghosyan’s strategic mindset is another important feature that will help AffPapa pursue its own strategic goals and ambition to excel.</p>
<p>This development is another important milestone that will help assure AffPapa’s long-term success, Chandler added. Recently, AffPapa also announced the launch of TheGamblest, a B2B Director and News Portal that brings readers the latest insights from iGaming.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Casino Guru won the AffPapa Award for best branding of the year and the two companies have been working together since July.</p>
