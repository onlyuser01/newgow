<p>The Australian government statutory body responsible for the regulation of broadcasting, radiocommunications and telecommunications, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), expanded its list of illegal gambling websites. On Thursday, ACMA asked internet service providers (ISPs) in Australia to block access to more illegal gambling websites.</p>
<p>ACMA Asks ISPs to Block 9 Illegal Gambling Websites</p>
<p>The request comes after the Authority uncovered nine gambling websites that operate in breach of the current gambling regulation, the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. A list released by ACMA reveals that the latest websites that are expected to be blocked include: 21Bit Casino, Winning Days, Lucky Elf Casino, Oshi Casino, Lets Lucky, NeoSpin, Ripper Casino, BC.Game and Boho Casino.</p>
<p>“The ACMA has requested that Australian internet service providers block more illegal offshore gambling websites, after investigations found 9 services to be operating in breach of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001.“ Australian Communications and Media Authority</p>
<p>The authority reminded the customers that some gambling operators seem legitimate but may be operating without a license. This, according to ACMA, creates a risk for the customers. The regulator explained it compiled a list of licensed partners which consumers can check and ensure they are engaging in online gambling activities via a licensed operator. The ACMA warned that illegal gambling operators do not adhere to the established regulations and customers using such operators are facing a risk of losing their money.</p>
<p>“The ACMA is reminding consumers that even if a service looks legitimate, its unlikely to have important customer protections. This means Australians who use illegal gambling services risk losing their money,“ added ACMA</p>
<p>The Authority Continues to Monitor Online Gambling</p>
<p>Blocking illegal offshore gambling websites isn’t a new practice for ACMA. Back in 2017, new rules were implemented for online gambling that sought to decrease the number of illegal operators offering services to Australians. Once the rules came into effect, more than 180 illegal operators withdrew from the market.</p>
<p>In addition, the Authority continues to ban illegal gambling websites seeking to protect customers. Since November 2019, when the ACMA made the first request to block illegal gambling websites, 642 such domains have been blocked. ACMA’s latest blocking request comes after recently it discovered two companies breached advertising rules.</p>
<p>Considering that Australians are infamous for having the biggest gambling losses per capita, ACMA’s efforts undoubtedly bring a positive impact. It’s not only online gambling that enjoys significant popularity in Australia. The country has a significant number of slot machines, nearly five times as many as the slots available in the US.</p>
