<p>After the successful launch of other fresh games like Triple Fruit Deluxe Megaways, Rising Samurai: Hold &amp; Win, Crabbin’ Crazy, and Colossus: Hold &amp; Win, top online game provider and content aggregator iSoftBet has added a brand new slot to its portfolio.</p>

<p>Game Design &amp; How to Play</p>
<p>The company’s head of games Mark Claxton stated the new game is expected to bring innovation to an otherwise classic theme while allowing players to enjoy a modern twist and a more elevated approach to the classic game.</p>
<p>The main role of players is to focus on getting as many Golden Jokers as they can while enjoying the simple design with hidden gems on the reels. The 5×4-grid has a golden frame and takes up a big chunk of the screen.</p>
<p>The game features a 5 by 4 grid surrounded by a golden frame that takes up most of the space on the screen. The background appears blurry, changing in yellow and red shades, while the logo is located in the top left corner. The symbols for the three Jackpots are found above the reels. Players can buy the Bonus Wheel feature using the available buttons to the left. The Bonus Wheel feature activates the double-up feature.</p>
<p>The spin button has “1024 ways” written on it, letting players know that all combinations within the game will reward the player. Golden Jokers accepts wins in 1024 different ways. To win, a player needs to land a minimum of three identical symbols on adjacent reels.</p>
<p>Game Symbols</p>
<p>The Golden Joker symbol is portrayed as a woman with blue eyes who is wearing red lipstick and a yellow and red Joker hat. This is also the highest-paying symbol and it offers even more generous payouts when part of the Free Spins feature. The lower paying symbols are portrayed as classic fruit symbols including pears, plums, grapes, lemons, watermelons, and cherries. Symbols that are more valuable are bells, blue and red 7s, and the Golden Joker.</p>
<p>The Wild Symbol is represented by two red dice and the Diamond Scatter Symbol that is required to engage the Bonus Wheel. The Bonus Wheel is triggered when landing between three and five Scatter symbols anywhere on the grid. In response, they will bring players between one and three-wheel spins.</p>
<p>Each of the spins can trigger as many as 15 Free Spins or a cash prize that could bring players up to 10,000 coins. Landing Wild symbols during the Free Spins round will trigger Wild Multipliers worth 2x or 3x each. Each of the multipliers will multiply up to 27 times, triggering golden wins. The Double Up feature can double players’ bets, while also doubling the Diamond Scatter Symbol’s size and having to cover two positions on the reel. The game is available on desktop computers, notepads, and mobile devices.</p>
