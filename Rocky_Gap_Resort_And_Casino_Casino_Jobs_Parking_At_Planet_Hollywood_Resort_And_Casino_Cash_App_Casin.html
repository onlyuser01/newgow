<p>Evoplay is doubling down on its European expansion with the developer’s unique gaming content heading into the Italian market after receiving authorization from the official gaming regulator. The company is gearing up to launch in the highly-competitive and lucrative market for igaming products which will further extend its presence in Europe.</p>
<p>Evoplay Clears All Regulatory Prerequisites for Entry</p>
<p>Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi welcomed the opportunity and the company’s Italian market foray:</p>
<p>“In the last few years, we’ve grown at an exponential rate, becoming one of Europe’s fastest growing studios in the process. With this in mind, it’s fantastic to see more than sixty of our titles gaining certification in such a vibrant market like Italy.” Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi</p>
<p>Evoplay now holds a license from the Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli and has satisfied all prerequisites to operate as an independent gaming entity. As part of this process, Evoplay has undergone BMM Testlabs certifications. Evoplay brings an extensive portfolio to the market with 62 games, among which 52 slots and 10 instant win titles.</p>
<p>Italian operators will have their pick of the litter with popular products such as Gold of Sirens, Temple of Dead, Ellen’s Fortune, Fruit Super Nova 100, Cycle of Luck, and many others. These games will be extended to players in the country by the respective brands that decide to add them to their portfolios.</p>
<p>Despite strong regulatory headwinds over the past years and reduced advertising of gambling products, the pastime has continued to generate a strong gross gaming revenue, enough that it seems to have the likes of Evoplay join the country.</p>
<p>Italy an Important and Promising Market for Evoplay</p>
<p>Malakchi confirmed that Evoplay has been keeping an eye out in Italy for a while now and has been impressed by the market’s tremendous growth. This move into Italy is not just about the country’s igaming market, but is also going to be used as a stepping-stone for Evoplay’s further growth in Europe, Malakchi said.</p>
<p>Evoplay recently released its Wild Overlords Bonus Buy slot game and is doubling down on its efforts to continue adding to the more than 100 games that the company has developed across numerous igaming verticals.</p>
