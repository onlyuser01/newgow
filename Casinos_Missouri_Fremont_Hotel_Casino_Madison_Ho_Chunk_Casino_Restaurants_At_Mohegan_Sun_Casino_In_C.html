<p>Megaways Casino brings together all of BTG’s authentic games in a Gamesys-developed gaming environment, with the Megaways-game mechanic taking a central piece in the new casino.</p>
<p>Gamesys Creates a New Home for BTG Games</p>
<p>Gamesys partnered up with iGaming supplier Big Time Gaming to lunch a new gaming platform called Megaways Casino. The former developed and designed it to appeal to players and put all Megaways brand and BTG games in a “New Home”.</p>
<p>BTG CEO Nik Robinson praised their new partner for living up to their name by providing a beautiful craft that was done with care.</p>
<p>The platform features all of Gamesys and BTG‘s old and new titles, destinations, slots, casino and live casino games. The Megaways series offers a wide arrange of free and exclusive games as well as “Mega promotions” which are designed to provide players with more ways to win prizes.</p>
<p>Gamesys marketing director Simon Mizzi expressed his delight to work with BTG noting that Megaways is the most popular game mechanic out there and he’s pleased to partner with BTG to develop and launch Megaways Casino site to UK players.</p>
<p>This latest launch is part of a tested strategy to sign exclusive deals with slots providers. Previously in 2015 and 2019, the operator launched Monopoly Casino site in UK and Riches casino brand respectively.</p>
<p>Gamesys and BTG Focus on Improving Player Experience</p>
<p>Despite COVID-19, Gamesys posted a strong revenue growth in 2020 which has helped the company remain focused on responsible gambling. Gamesys has remained entirely committed to its responsible gambling team and resources, adding fresh capabilities to protect players.</p>
<p>The company’s goal is not only to provide a great gaming experience but to also focus on responsible gaming by monitoring and interacting with players. Gamesys constantly reminds players to use their responsible gaming controls and self-help tools.</p>
<p>A significant achievement for the company is that more than one-third of their players have set a deposit limit. They also stated that over half of all sessions in the UK didn’t include money which tells a lot about Gamesys and their goal to provide a fun environment for their customers while minimizing risk.</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming doesn’t stay behind and has previously partnered with Future Anthem to develop and integrate player behavioral modeling and interactive visualization. This new AI can monitor and predict player behavior and stile in gaming in real-time in order to provide safe and responsible gaming.</p>
<p>The AI also has some other exciting features like recommendations, opportunities and predictions which in turn provide players with a fun and entertaining ways to earn more revenue as well as play safe.</p>
<p>This science platform is hosted on Microsoft Azure cloud and doesn’t hold any personal information only player ID and transactions and it will benefit both players and partners.</p>
