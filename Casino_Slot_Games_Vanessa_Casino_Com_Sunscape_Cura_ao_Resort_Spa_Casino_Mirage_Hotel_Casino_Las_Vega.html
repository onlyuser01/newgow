<p>Century Casinos Incorporated last week announced that it has inked a lucrative sports betting deal with Circa Sports Colorado LLC. The latter is now Century Casinos’ official sports betting partner. The two companies are looking into gaining access to the nascent sports betting sector in Colorado. Already, each of them has submitted applications with Colorado’s gaming regulator who they hope will approve their licenses by May 1 – they intend to launch the Circa Sports mobile sportsbook around this time.</p>
<p>The Terms of the Agreement</p>
<p>To begin with, the aforementioned, Circa Sports mobile sportsbook will be operating in association with Colorado Master Licenses for sports betting which is held by one of its subsidiaries. Also, the agreement between the two partners will be viable and valid for 15 years. It will include a number of perks especially for Circa Sports which is venturing out of its home market in a bid to set a foundation in Colorado’s growing market.</p>
<p>Some of these perks that the company expects include market access fees, a share of net gaming revenue as well as a minimum revenue guarantee payable annually. Circa Sports CEO Derek Stevens has been very vocal about the high hopes they have for their operations in Colorado. This primarily because of the prospective benefits the company intends to reap from the state in both the short and long term.</p>
<p>“Colorado has proven to be an ideal place to mark the official expansion of Circa Sports outside of Nevada with its pro-growth regulatory environment. Furthermore, the Colorado Division of Gaming has done an excellent job to ensure a seamless application and launch process,” Stevens commented during the announcement.</p>
<p>For the residents of Colorado who are interested in sports betting, the entry of Circa Sports into that market is a sign of great things to come. The company is known for its top-notch customer-first approach to the sports betting business. This has earned it a top sport in Nevada and will probably propel it to even greater heights as it extends its footprint across the United States.</p>
<p>Sports Betting in Colorado</p>
<p>Like many other states, Colorado recently legalized sports betting after finding out just how beneficial the activity can be to its economy. Proposition DD, the bill that allowed sports betting, was approved by voters last year in November.</p>
<p>With sports betting now legal in Colorado, the state’s gaming commission was tasked with taking responsibility for and overseeing the activities of the sector. The Colorado Division of Gaming, the regulator, is also responsible for drafting the rules that will govern sports betting in the sector – these will reportedly be released before the end of February.</p>
<p>In addition to that the gaming control division has also been accepting submissions for license applications from interested sports betting operators. By the end of February, it is estimated that it will have awarded up to 33 licenses.</p>
