<p>Ubisoft has protested against Ejoy.com’s Area F2, which the company alleges is a clone of its IP, Rainbow Six: Siege. Now the company has filed a complaint against Google and Apple to remove the game from the online stores after the companies first refused.</p>
<p>Ubisoft Suing Google and Apple for Distributing a Clone of Rainbow Six Siege</p>
<p>First reported by Bloomberg, Ubisoft Entertainment SA is suing Apple and Google. The video game company accuses the tech giants of distributing a clone of its famous video game Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Siege (R6S).</p>
<p>Ubisoft saw multiple resemblances in “Area F2”, which is a game by Ejoy.com, owned by Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd, and filed a complaint with a federal court in Los Angeles on Friday against Google and Apple over the aforementioned companies’ failure to comply with a takedown request Ubisoft had made. Ubisoft deemed the competitor’s game a “near carbon copy“.</p>
<p>Apple, Google, and Alibaba Group are yet expected to respond to the accusations. Although it only launched at the end of April, “Area F2” already has more than 5 million installs. Ubisoft had already contacted both Google and Apple with a request to exclude the game from their stores. They are yet to receive an official response.</p>
<p>The New Mobile Game “AF2 is copied from R6S”</p>
<p>Alibaba Group bought Ejoy back in 2017 when the company was expanding its mobile and online gaming market. Upon the release of Area F2, the game quickly got the attention of Ubisoft which objected to the visuals.</p>
<p>“Virtually every aspect of AF2 is copied from R6S, from the operator selection screen to the final scoring screen, and everything in between.” Ubisoft</p>
<p>There are some 55 million players that have already registered for Ubisoft’s Rainbow Six: Siege. With more than 3 million players active daily, the game is really popular and it is even played as a competitive esports.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is clearly showing that despite the fact “Area F2” is a mobile game, it cannot freely clone original intellectual property from the PC and console versions of R6S. In light of this, Ubisoft considers AF2 a copyright infringement of its intellectual property.</p>
