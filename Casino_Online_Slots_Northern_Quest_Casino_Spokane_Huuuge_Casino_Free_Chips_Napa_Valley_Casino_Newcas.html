<p>iGaming operator and provider FansUnite’s subsidiaries Askott Entertainment and E.G.G. have received a gaming supply license and a gaming service license from the MGA to operate in Malta and the EU.</p>
<p>New B2B and B2C Offerings in Malta</p>
<p>Canadian online casino operator and technology provider FansUnite Entertainment announced Monday it has received approval from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) for a gaming service license and critical gaming supply license for two subsidiaries, Askott Entertainment and E.G.G Limited.</p>
<p>FansUnite is now officially authorized to offer a large array of online gaming services in Malta and the European Union. The group operates in various gaming areas, such as online casino, pool and fixed-odds betting, and controlled skill games.</p>
<p>Gaming operators registered in Malta will now be able to use FansUnite’s business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) products.</p>
<p>FansUnite Not Required to Undergo Licensing Process for White Label Services for Partners</p>
<p>White label solutions provider Askott Entertainment, acquired by FansUnite last August, secured a critical gaming supply license with the MGA. This enables the company to sell its B2B technology to Malta-licensed iGaming and sports betting operators.</p>
<p>The group’s E.G.G. Limited division obtained a B2C gaming service license, allowing FansUnite to carry operations and operate its brands within the EU market. The gaming supplier’s portfolio includes a UK sportsbook, e-sports odds-making, and iGaming options.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FansUnite will be able to supply its partners with white label services and is not required to “undergo the licensing process, software testing procedures, payment processing configurations, and banking requirements,” according to the company’s announcement on Monday.</p>
<p>Crucial Step for FansUnite’s Growth Strategy</p>
<p>Scott Burton, FansUnite CEO declared that the company spent years developing its technology to “a global standard that is desirable by international regulatory bodies” and that they were able to meet the MGA’s “extremely stringent and rigorous technical, software, and corporate audits and qualify for two separate licenses.”</p>
<p>Following the approval, Mr. Burton said that FansUnite “will look to continue executing on [its] growth strategy, by collaborating with new partners in Europe in order to distribute [its] sports and esports betting platform along with [its] RNG casino game titles to an expanded customer base.”</p>
<p>The MGA’s recognition of FansUnite as a legal gaming group was crucial for the company to be able to compete with iGaming rivals Unibet, Pokerstars, and Betfair, as well as expanding in new countries, providing a superior corporate tax system and additional payments options.</p>
<p>FansUnite’s stock jumped by 16.4% to $0.78 on December 7, up almost 300% over November. On December 8, FANS shares fell by nearly 9%, closing at $0.71 on the Canadian Securities Exchange, formerly known as the Canadian National Stock Exchange.</p>
