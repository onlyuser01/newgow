    <h1>Casino Online No Deposit Bonus Asia Lotus Casino Havasu Landing Casino Jackson Casino Harrah S Chero</h1>

<p>Supplier of B2B Live Casino services Evolution announced in a press release today it went live in the UK via Ladbrokes and Coral, with the other Entain brands, Gala Casino and Gala Bingo set to follow suit.</p>
<p>Evolution’s Full Breadth of Online Games</p>
<p>The UK launch expands the current partnership in the online casino space with one of the largest sports betting and gaming groups globally, spanning across a number of European and US jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The latest agreement Evolution reached with Entain provides for the launch of the full suite of online games supplied by Evolution on the online platforms of Ladbrokes, Coral and Gala in the UK, with two of the most popular Evolution titles, Lightning Roulette and Crazy Time, already live at Ladbrokes and Coral.</p>
<p>“The UK market is a particularly important market for us. We are delighted that Ladbrokes, Coral and Gala customers will now have access to the full breadth of Evolution Group online games, including our very latest gaming innovations.” Gavin Hamilton, Commercial Director, Europe, Evolution</p>
<p>Other titles such as Gonzo’s Treasure Hunt Live and the rest of the suite, including all Evolution’s first person RNG games will be added to the mix in the coming days following the debut of the two award-winning game titles.</p>
<p>“We are enormously excited to provide our thousands of players in the UK and globally with Evolution’s world-class online games.” Richard Barr, Director, Gaming, LadbrokesCoral</p>
<p>Valuable Addition to NetEnt and Red Tiger Slots</p>
<p>The addition of Evolution’s full suite of games will further expand the product offering at Entain-owned brands which already feature world-leading online slot game titles from the supplier’s brands NetEnt and Red Tiger and will further enhance player experience.</p>
<p>Evolution acquired both brands last year, with the acquisition of NetEnt AB stirring some controversy due to a number of employees at the Swedish game developer made redundant immediately after completion of the £1.6 billion transaction.</p>
<p>Speaking of strategic acquisitions, Evolution announced last month an agreement with online slot games developer Big Time Gaming to acquire the “thought leader in online slots” for a total consideration of up to €450 million paid in cash and Evolution shares.</p>
<p>The move to acquire the developer of original slot gaming solutions and the popular megaways gameplay mechanic continued to deliver on Evolution’s strategy to consolidate its position as a leading supplier of iGaming products, initiated by the acquisitions of NetEnt and Red Tiger.</p>
