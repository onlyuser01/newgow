<p>Thank you so much for helping me with this, I really do appreciate it!</p>
<p>Following statement is an absolute lie. It is incomprehensible that they can state "You announced you had no particular reason to the game-break" when I have told them in the exact same chat that I made the self-exclusion in the first place because I was gambling too much.</p>
<p>to the game break/closing and that you felt in control of the situation:"</p>
<p>in accordance with. You announced, you had no particular reason</p>
<p>"Regarding your Betsson game account, you had requested a game account again</p>
<p>It is stated in MGA:s license that if the player may have problem gambling issues, that player shall be excluded across all brands operated by the B2C licensee. - I indeed did let them know that I had a problem with gambling yet they still agreed to open the account and did not block me from other casinos from the same brand.</p>
<p>However I stated in the same chat, that the reason for my self-exclusion was because I had a problem with gambling and I gambled too much. So it was very clear for them that there is a very strong possibility that I still have gambling problem as it is officially a disease.</p>
<p>The reason behind this is partly because I requested the re-opening after self-exclusion myself on 10th of April 2021 and told them that I can play responsibly now.</p>
<p>I also made a reclamation to CasinoEuro and Betsson but Casino Euro have already stated to me that they don’t feel they or Betsson have made a mistake.</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p>I also made a reclamation to CasinoEuro and Betsson but Casino Euro have already stated to me that they don’t feel they or Betsson have made a mistake.</p>
<p>The reason behind this is partly because I requested the re-opening after self-exclusion myself on 10th of April 2021 and told them that I can play responsibly now.</p>

<p>They replied me in Finnish:</p>
<p>"Koskien Betssonin pelitiliänne, olitte pyytäneet pelitilin uudelleen</p>
<p>avaamista 10.4.2021, jolloin esitettiin kysymyksiä sääntöjen</p>
<p>mukaisesti. Ilmoititte, ettei teillä ollut erityistä syytä</p>
<p>pelitauolle/sulkemiseen ja että tunsit hallitsevasi tilanetta:"</p>
<p>Which translates to:</p>
<p>"Regarding your Betsson game account, you had requested a game account again</p>
<p>opening on 10 April 2021, then a question was asked</p>
<p>in accordance with. You announced, you had no particular reason</p>
<p>to the game break/closing and that you felt in control of the situation:"</p>
