<p>EveryMatrix, a business-to-business iGaming software provider, has inked a new deal with the gambling juggernaut BetMGM. Following that, the supplier will power the operator’s New Jersey platform with games from its two in-house studios.</p>
<p>BetMGM to Get More Games</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, BetMGM will receive many new titles from EveryMatrix’s Spearhead Studios and Armadillo Studios. As a result, operator’s users will get to play some of EveryMatrix’s freshest games, including Daly Spin It And Win It and The Lioness with Amanda Nunes.</p>
<p>The Lioness is Armadillo Studios’ first branded slot. The game will celebrate the feats of the professional Brazilian MMA champion Amanda “The Lioness” Nunes. Armadillo Studios said that the game will release on August 2 this year, three days after Nunes’ match against her fellow MMA competitor Julianna Peña.</p>
<p>Armadillo Studios aims to leverage Nunes popularity and use the new title to appeal to fans of professional fighting sports. The studio hopes to capitalize on the upcoming match and use the game’s release as a means to expand its footprint in the US. This will also help BetMGM which is set to implement the exciting new title to its New Jersey offerings.</p>
<p>In addition, BetMGM might also add live EveryMatrix content in the future, the provider suggested.</p>
<p>The Operator Wants to Be Unrivaled</p>
<p>Erik Nyman, EveryMatrix’s president for America, addressed the new deal. He said that his company and its subsidiaries are happy to team up with an operator as successful as BetMGM. Nyman is also excited by the opportunity to launch Spearhead Studios and Armadillo Studios on BetMGM’s platform.</p>
<p>Speaking about the two studios, Nyman said that both of them have big plans for the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>“Both have ambitious plans for the next half of 2022, and our relationship with BetMGM is an important step in the process.”</p>
<p>Oliver Bartlett, director of gaming for BetMGM, also shared his thoughts on the deal. He shared that his team is just as excited to work with EveryMatrix and bring its “great content” to BetMGM players in the United States.</p>
<p>Bartlett revealed that BetMGM’s key strategy is to provide world-class gaming experiences to its customers. The addition of EveryMatrix’s engaging titles is a crucial step to that end as the operator continues to strengthen its position as a top gambling company.</p>
<p>New Jersey seems to be a key market for BetMGM’s strategy. Just now, the operator announced that it will be adding Wizard Games titles to its NJ offerings as well.</p>
