    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Casino Party Rentals Milky Way Casino Online Indian Head Casino Dani</h1>

<p>Thank you for the space and I hope you help me.</p>
<p>I made a deposit on 01/19/2021 in the amount of 259.95 as shown in the attached image. I canceled the first deposit bonus amount and continued playing with the balance, made a balance of 1200.00 NOK and tried to withdraw. When I clicked the withdrawal button, it was described that I would need to send all my documents. I did everything they asked for, I sent everything, but then they asked me to print the documents and take a photo, again I did what they asked me to do, so my account was verified. They sent e-mail congratulating and saying that my account was verified, I will even attach here the proof of this verification. The problem is that since the 20th I have been trying to withdraw and simply the message that my request was accepted, but it does not appear in the casino history, and when I sent an email, they said that I had not made any request, that I had to request it again. It turns out that I tried both ways. I did it by bank transfer and the ecopayz method. The interesting thing is that when I tried to make this withdrawal by bank transfer the message appears as in the attached image that are working to correct the problem, but in the various emails I sent to support, at no time did they talk about it and the most interesting thing is that at ecopayz appears that I was able to carry out the survey successfully, and the survey does not even appear in the history, much less the request reached them.</p>
<p>In short: I sent several messages to the support, including the image to show that I tried to do it, but the request is not sent to them. They answered me in both messages so that I could try again because I had not made the request. Every day since the beginning I am trying, it appears that I got it, but it is not sent to the responsible sector. If you want I can send all the emails explaining what happened and their response. I don't want to rush, but it seems to me that the casino is not acting in good faith.</p>
<p>I ask you to help me, if you want I can pass my login and password for you to test yourself.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance. We are a family owned and operated business. We are a family owned and operated business.</p>
