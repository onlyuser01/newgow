<p>Among the symbols, players will find sparkling crystal balls, diamonds, rubies, and a luxurious king’s crown. Juggling clubs, embellished shoes, and wooden lutes also appear among the selection.</p>
<p>The purple reels take the form of a classic slot machine with gold accents adding a touch of glamor. This helps uphold the classic slot machine feel of Joker Jewels.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a whimsical world run by a charismatic Joker.</p>
