<p>The renowned iGaming aggregator and provider of quality content for the online casino segment has struck a new partnership with Trigger Studios</p>

<p>Enhanced Mathematics Guide Trigger Studios’ Development</p>
<p>Trigger Studios is in fact one of the newest gaming studios out there, and the fact that Relax Gaming has already scouted it out as a worthwhile entry into its Silver Bullet platform points to the quality of products the developers have been putting forward.</p>
<p>Trigger Studios was established in 2022 and it has focused on providing players with what it calls “visually-stunning” slots that usher in brand-new and innovative game mechanics. One of those games is Phoenix Up Cash, which is now a part of the Silver Bullet product offer. Trigger Studios is equally excited about what it sees as a fantastic opportunity to scale up its product offer and strike home with more tier-one operators.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Relax Gaming Director of casino products Shelley Hannah had this to say:</p>
<p>Trigger Studios has earned a reputation for creating unique titles that greatly engage players and are fast becoming a pioneer in the industry. To be able to add them as our latest Silver Bullet partner is a great coup and we know operators will be delighted to showcase the brand’s portfolio of games.

<p>Trigger Studios co-founder Job Spiero was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see his company take off with a brand that is trusted, and reliable and can serve as a springboard for Trigger Studios as it attempts to conquer new audiences, players, and brands.</p>
<p>Spiero was pleased with the fact that a heavyweight such as Relax Gaming has been able to recognize the innovative quality of the mathematics, concepts and features used to power the Trigger Studios’ experience.</p>
<p>The co-founder added that his company was focused on providing players with the most exciting content possible and bringing them fresh experiences across the board. He argued that the mathematics used in the games provided by Trigger Studios were enhanced in a way that makes the content engaging and worthwhile for individual players.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Relax Gaming has been scaling up its geographic reach, striking a trio of partnerships with brands in Greece, including Interwetten, Betsson, and Novibet. Relax Gaming’s aggregation platforms now offers more than 4,000 online games by esteemed third-party suppliers.</p>
