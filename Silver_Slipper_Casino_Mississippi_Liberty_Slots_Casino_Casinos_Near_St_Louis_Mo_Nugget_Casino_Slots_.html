<p>Jungle Wild review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Welcome to the jungle, we’ve got fun and slots! WMS’s classic slot has a reasonably sized following in the slot world that largely seems based on how long it has been around.</p>
<p>There isn’t very much to the slot in terms of theme and storyline. Jungle Wilds has a jungle setting and very little else to make it stand out. There are monkeys, flowers and jungle parrots on the reels, but not much in the way of characters or events to engage the player.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The blandness of the theme is emphasised by the antiquated visuals. Jungle Wild was released in 2011, and feels even older than that. The art consists of pixelated attempts at photorealism and as such lacks anything like a personality while also looking cheap and ancient.</p>
<p>In keeping with its age, there is little animation apart from flashing win indicators and the spinning of the reels.</p>
<p>This is accompanied by a vaguely steel band like spin sound, but there is no real music or any real sound effects to speak of. A little jungle noise would have gone a long way in giving this slot some atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>With its aged graphics and standard five reel, three row style there is little about Jungle Wild that suggests it might have anything interesting or unusual up its sleeve.</p>
<p>Turns out, that is the case. Jungle Wild sports thirty winlines, one bonus (a free spin bonus no less – see below for details) and no gamble feature.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>It takes three or more Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels to trigger the Bonus Game. Three Bonus symbols gets the player five free spins, while four or five Bonus symbols get seven and twenty free spins respectively.</p>
<p>During the free spins, two random reels will be Wild on every spin.</p>
<p>Five free spins can be added to your total by hitting three Bonus symbols during the Free Spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.96%, almost exactly the same as our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.30 if the player is using all thirty lines, up to a maximum of $/£/€90.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Jungle Wild used to be a solid slot, but is feeling its age. The pixelated graphics and simplistic sound and animations make for a poor user experience.</p>
<p>The gameplay is decent, if a little underwhelming, and the RTP is only a little under 96%. Coupled with the game’s high volatility, this is a decent game for players who are pursuing our slot machine strategies, but there are better looking slots with similar statistics out there.</p>
<p>Maybe give one of them a try.</p>
