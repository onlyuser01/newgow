<p>Micro-betting specialist Simplebet just unveiled a new partnership with Bet99, a Sports Venture Holdings brand. As agreed between the two companies, Simplebet will power the operator with its odds feeds, allowing it to provide micro-betting to customers in Canada.</p>
<p>As per the deal, Simplebet will offer odds for a number of prominent leagues, such as the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. In addition to that, Simplebet will also power its new product with feeds for college football and basketball.</p>
<p>The multi-year partnership will help Bet99 expand its presence in Canada, capitalizing on the growing popularity of the micro-betting vertical. Micro bets are a form of bets that allows customers to place wagers on specific moments of a sports game.</p>
<p>By launching micro-betting in Canada, Bet99 reiterates its commitment to providing fans with fresh and exciting wagering experiences. This was further attested by the company’s recent relaunch of its sports betting platform.</p>
<p>Last year, the operator also teamed up with the National Hockey League, launching a new free-to-play game.</p>
<p>Partnering with Bet99 Aligns with Simplebet’s Mission</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the new partnership agreement with Jared Beber, Bet99’s chief executive officer, expressing his team’s thrill to engage with Simplebet. According to him, the partnership will allow his company to “bring a new level of engagement” to its customers.</p>
<p>Beber explained that the tie-up with Simplebet will help the company improve its appeal to customers.</p>
<p>This collaboration will enhance our offerings and provide our users with a more dynamic and interactive sports betting experience. Jared Beber, CEO, Bet99</p>
<p>Chris Bevilacqua, Simplebet’s chief executive officer, said that his team is dedicated to leveraging cutting-edge technology to transform the sports wagering sector. He also commented on the partnership with Bet99 and said that it reflects this very goal.</p>
<p>Partnering with Bet99 aligns perfectly with our mission, and we look forward to delivering unique micro-market experiences that will captivate Canadian sports enthusiasts. Chris Bevilacqua, CEO, Simplebet</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Simplebet made further strides into the United States, expanding its presence thanks to a partnership with ClutchBet in Iowa and Colorado. Around the same time, the company also penned an agreement with Hard Rock Digital.</p>
<p>In April, Simplebet also teamed up with Amelco to spearhead micro-betting across the United States.</p>
