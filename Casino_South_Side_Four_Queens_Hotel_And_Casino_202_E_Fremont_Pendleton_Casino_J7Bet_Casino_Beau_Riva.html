<p>Just Slots, a promising forthcoming company in the iGaming sector, has secured a new investment worth €1.125 from Yolo Investments, a venture capital firm with a sound presence in the industry, and a backer of promising start-ups in the field, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>Just Slots has already caught the attention of the gaming sector, and it has already been known as a trusted B2B entity, which puts a strong focus on both customers and end-users. This philosophy is derived from the vast experience of Thomas Groven, CEO and Christine Parkhill, CCO. Groven is a former PressEnter Group Chief Commercial Officer and Parkhill was part of Push Gaming for six years and assumed several roles in the company’s structure during that time.</p>
<p>For its part, Yolo Investments believes that Just Slots stands out by its robust development process and brings much value to the table through a variety of products it builds with businesses and customers in mind. Groven has welcomed the opportunity to secure new investment from a company that is generally associated with the industry’s most innovative and talented projects.</p>
<p>"Today’s announcement puts us in a strong position as we look to press forward ahead of the launch of our first game later this year. The strategic investment from Yolo Investments empowers us to enhance our internal operations and attract top-tier talent to our remarkable team. These elements are vital as we embark on this exciting growth journey," Groven said.</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Parkhill who was equally pleased with seeing Yolo Investments pick the company and put their trust in it, offering a chance to enhance the technical capabilities at the core of Just Slots.</p>
<p>Just Slots is yet to debut with any slot products, and it will be attending ICE 2024 where more details bout its immediate plans will be revealed. In the meantime, it suffices to say that Yolo Investments is a huge hallmark of trust which makes the industry anticipate Just Slots forthcoming releases with trepidation.</p>
<p>Whether Just Slots delivers on anything unique is a matter of time to find out – and we will soon enough. Yolo Investments in the meantime has not been shy about making its presence felt across the board with a new €100m fund designated at bolstering the venture capital firm’s presence in crypto-focused projects.</p>
