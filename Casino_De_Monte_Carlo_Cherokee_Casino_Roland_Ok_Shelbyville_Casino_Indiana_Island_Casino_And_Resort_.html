    <h1>Casino De Monte Carlo Cherokee Casino Roland Ok Shelbyville Casino Indiana Island Casino And Resort</h1>

<p>Unibet, a Kindred Group company that specializes in sports and casino gaming, has signed a new content partnership with Bragg Gaming Group, targeting the iGaming market in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The content tie-up builds upon the existing relationship between Unibet and Bragg Gaming Group in other jurisdictions, and the current expansion covers games provided to Unibet from Bragg’s proprietary suppliers and third-party partners.</p>
<p>Among the games that are now available in the United Kingdom under the Unibet umbrella are titles delivered as part of the Powered by Bragg content aggregation solution, as well as the in-house Atomic Slot Lab and Bragg Studios development arms.</p>
<p>This means that popular games such as Fairy Dust, Egyptian Magic, and Dreamy Genie are all part of the content library at Unibet. Kindred Group Head of RNG Casino Gareth Jennings welcomed this new opportunity and said that the company was very happy to continue on what has been a successful collaboration between the two.</p>
<p>Commenting on the specific opportunity to add more content from Bragg, Jennings said that Kindred and its players were accustomed to the high-quality content that the supplier delivered for the Group in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>"It’s the continuation of a fruitful partnership and it’s been a pleasure working with Bragg to get the launch completed," Jennings said firmly.</p>
<p>He was joined by Bragg Gaming Group Chief Operating OfficerLara Falzon who was similarly pleased to welcome another partnership expansion with Unibet, based on the two companies’ existing ties in other regions that will now carry over to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>"Unibet.co.uk offers us further market penetration of the highest quality and is a significant boost to our interest in the largest market in Europe," Falzon added. Bragg Gaming Group has had a string of successes in recent months, having teamed up with many of the world’s leading operators and brands.</p>
<p>Notably, Bragg Gaming rolled out its content in Pennsylvania with Rush Street Interactive, further expanding its presence in the regulated iGaming market in the United States. The supplier formed another major partnership with 888, covering international markets, and reflective of the two companies’ ambition to break ground in more jurisdictions by bringing the best possible content, product, and services possible.</p>
<p>Speaking of big brand launches, Bragg Gaming is three for three in recent months with a PokerStars global alliance that sees the Flutter Entertainment-owned card room significantly strengthen its presence in online casinos.</p>
