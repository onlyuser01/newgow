<p>RETAbet Group has sought to expand its clout in South America by putting a greater focus on competitive video gaming, or esports as it’s known. To get there, the company is using the 24/7 high-margin betting product by SIS, the Competitive Gaming platform.</p>
<p>SIS Continues to Expand Geographically with Trusted Partners</p>
<p>This builds on the existing relationship between the two companies and will now feature Esoccer and Ebasketball head-to-head esports events that will be available to RETAbet Group customers around the clock. The titles featured and covered by RETAbet with SIS’s help will include NBA2K and FIFA online.</p>
<p>SIS’ Competitive Gaming is an entire package of spot-on solutions that will help empower the experience for esports fans and consumers. The product comes with live streamed pictures, on-screen graphics, betting triggers, data, and a number of events – in fact, some 150,000 live options every year. SIS has welcomed this opportunity as the company is also looking to build up its footprint in the Latin American region.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, SIS Head of Sales for the LatAm and Iberia, Angel Calderon, said that the extension was another landmark in the region. The popularity of esports is undeniable, he explained, and SIS was in a position to provide market-leading solutions:</p>
<p>Our offering is perfectly placed to complement the short-form, always-on experience that RETAbet customers have with our Live Betting Channels, so we’re confident the reception is going to be strong. SIS Head of Sales for the LatAm and Iberia, Angel Calderon</p>
<p>RETAbet Happy to Continue to Strengthen Its Betting Options</p>
<p>RETAbet Group COO Igor Extremo similarly welcomed the partnership and said that he was delighted to see the Group continue to build upon its existing relationship with SIS. He confirmed that since the collaboration began, the Group has seen increased betting traffic, translating into stronger revenue and margins.</p>
<p>SIS has been experiencing rapid regional growth in North and South America, along with its bastions in Europe. The company focuses on delivering both sports and esports solutions and has been able to drive significant growth for its partners across the board.</p>
