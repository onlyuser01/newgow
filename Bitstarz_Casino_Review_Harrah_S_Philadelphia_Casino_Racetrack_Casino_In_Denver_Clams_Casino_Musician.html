    <h1>Bitstarz Casino Review Harrah S Philadelphia Casino Racetrack Casino In Denver Clams Casino Musician</h1>

<p>Dear Yasin,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. I am very sorry to hear that you feel this way. However, we cannot ignore the many instances where you have exhibited negative behaviour towards our staff and company.</p>
<p>To provide context, you contacted us initially to change your details and complete the KYC process. Then, in live chat, you complained about RTP, claiming it was 3%, despite being advised that it was set to game provider standards. In response, we gave you a 10 euro bonus. The following day, you returned to live chat to complain about the RTP again, this time claiming it was at 10%, and requested another bonus. We informed you that we could not provide another bonus. Despite this, you were able to use every bonus code we had sent out via email to our existing customers. We also gave you other bonuses when you had to wait for your deposit to come through.</p>
<p>On January 20th, you requested a no deposit bonus, which we declined as we had already given you a free bonus the day before on January 19th. The following day, you requested another bonus after losing all your money, and then again on January 23rd. You permanently closed your account on that day, only to come back the following day and request its reopening because you had a bad day. We complied and reopened your account on January 24th, giving you a 20 euro bonus when you asked for a 10 euro no deposit bonus. You also benefited from the 10 euro free we gave to players for filling out the Casino survey. On January 27th, we gave you another 10 euro bonus for your birthday.</p>
<p>On January 30th, you reported a problem with a code not giving you the free spins it promised. We told you we were checking on the problem and would let you know. The next day, you came back to live chat and asked again for the spins. We told you we were still checking with the team, to which you replied "I sh*t on these spins" and left the chat. On February 1st, you came back and requested the spins again, after saying the previous day that you did not want them. You then attempted to blackmail us by threatening to leave a bad review on casinoguru if we didn't act fast enough. You also tried to blackmail us by saying you would post a screenshot from another casino where you received a "bad gateway" message.</p>
<p>On February 2nd, you requested yet another free bonus, stating that you were loyal and deposited daily. On February 3rd, you made another deposit using a bonus code, and asked if you could use the same code again. We informed you that not all codes can be used more than once. On February 4th, you asked to speak to a manager after being told we could not give you another free bonus. On February 5th, you returned to live chat and requested another free bonus, to which we told you that you would receive a code via email every day.</p>
<p>You also contacted our manager August, who gave you 50 euro free bonus money because you had issues with your account. You asked him for another free bonus on February 4th, and then again on February 6th and 8th, despite being told no. On February 8th, you sent an email to August stating that you were here again, and that you had been directed to him to request another bonus. You also mentioned that you would continue to make deposits, but only if you received another bonus.</p>
<p>We have closed your account because we feel you have a gambling problem, and we cannot continue with your negative behaviour towards our staff and company. We take our responsibility to our customers very seriously, and we always strive to provide the best service possible. However, we cannot tolerate any form of abuse or blackmail, and we will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect ourselves and our employees from such behaviour.</p>
<p>We strongly advise you to seek help if you have a problem with gambling. There are many resources available to assist you in managing your gambling behaviour and we hope you take advantage of them.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter.</p>
