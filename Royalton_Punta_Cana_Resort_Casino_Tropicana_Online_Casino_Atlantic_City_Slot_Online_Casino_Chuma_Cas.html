<p>Packed with a plethora of exciting features like Free Spins Respins, and Multipliers, the slot “promises to deliver an unforgettable gaming adventure” that will keep players entertained for hours in a row on. Here is everything you need to know about it.</p>

<p>Payday Pig Will “Leave Players Squealing with Excitement”</p>
<p>Booming Games’ director of product, Moritz Blume, has described the fresh release as a fun and original one that “promises to leave players squealing with excitement.” Blume also spoke about the entertainment potential of the game harnessed with the help of the Respins and Free Spins features that “deliver plenty of big win thrills so long as players are willing to join their pink piggy friends in the mud.”</p>
<p>Payday Pig is considered a new strong addition to the company’s constantly expanding portfolio of games with unique themes, innovative features, and volatility levels that can satisfy all spectrums of players in a variety of new markets. In May, the provider inked new content deals with Fortune Coins and Kindred.</p>
<p>Piggy Factor Respins, Free Spins, and Free Games</p>
<p>Players who are eager to try Payday Pig are invited to find their way to the farm and start exploring a fun adventure by joining their pink piggy friends in their search for big wins.</p>
<p>The slot counts nine active paylines and six different symbols, with three low-paying symbols (single, double, and triple BAR symbols) and three high-paying symbols (bags of gold, leprechaun hats, and pigs).</p>
<p>The grid is also packed with Wilds, Piggy Bonus symbols, and Piggy Factor symbols. The Wild symbols replace the rest of the symbols and help create winning combinations. Piggy Bonus symbols and Piggy Factor symbols trigger the exciting bonus features.</p>
<p>Players need to land at least one X symbol anywhere on the reels to be granted a Piggy Factor Respin. When this happens, the second and third reels will start to spin again with digits ranging from 0 to 9 to generate Multipliers leading to instant wins.</p>
<p>Three Scatter symbols landing on the reels will trigger 10 Free Spins while adding one more reel for even higher wins while the Piggy Factor Respin feature is active. During the Respin round, the second, third, and fourth reels will be filled with new digits.</p>
<p>At the end of each Free Game, the values on each line with an X will be added together, multiplying players’ stakes even further.</p>
<p>At the start of June, Booming Games announced it would add its content to TonyBet’s platform in Spain.</p>
