<p>BetMakers Technology Group, a provider of odds comparisons, intelligent betting platforms, analytics, and trading solutions, has announced that it has signed an amended odds and data distribution agreement with Darby Development and the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association.</p>
<p>Darby Development Is Sure BetMakers Will Take Horseracing to the Next Level</p>
<p>The renewed deal will see BetMakers as the two companies’ exclusive party to deliver and manage fixed-odds betting for the next 15 years (initially 10 years). Furthermore, BetMakers will be allowed to license and distribute any thoroughbred horseracing content to third parties if it is done with betting goals.</p>
<p>Dennis Drazin, the chief executive officer of Darby Development, shared that he is excited about the introduction of fixed-odds betting on horseracing. He said that the plan is to launch fixed-odds offerings starting March 2022 and to add online horseracing offerings in May. Drazin apologized for the time it has taken to launch fixed-odds offerings in New Jersey but added it was all to ensure the best customer experience.</p>
<p>Drazin added that he is excited to work with BetMakers – a company that has helped with the introduction of fixed-odds betting in the state. He explained that in BetMakers, Darby Development sees a strong long-term partner whose help will be crucial for taking horseracing to the next level.</p>
<p>BetMakers Expects to See a Huge Influx of Bettors as Fixed-odds Betting Goes Live</p>
<p>Todd Buckingham, the chief executive officer of BetMakers is glad to work with Dennis Drazin and his team. Buckingham emphasized Darby Development’s role in delivering a model that will allow bettors a way to benefit from the fixed-odds sports betting market.</p>
<p>According to Buckingham, the model that everyone agreed on is not only the best one but also fair to all participants – racing companies, rights holders, and betting operators alike. The CEO thanked Monmouth Park’s team, the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association, the NJ Racing Commission, and NJ DGE for their part in bringing fixed-odds horseracing betting to the state.</p>
<p>Buckingham ended by saying that BetMakers is most excited to provide bettors with the opportunity to fix the price of their runner when betting. He is sure that this will make betting seem much more secure and welcoming to people who wish to take their sports engagement further.</p>
<p>Christian Stuart, the chief executive officer of BetMakers North America, believes the unanimously positive response towards fixed-odds betting has the potential of attracting many new people to the world of thoroughbred horseracing and sports betting.</p>
<p>Stuart shares Buckingham’s belief that this will be a great opportunity for bettors and bookmakers and the rest of the industry. He noted that racing is very important wagering vertical because of its numerous events. This, combined with the warm response of bettors, is a great sign for the success of fixed-odds betting on horseracing.</p>
<p>Stuart concluded that he believes New Jersey’s approach to the matter has provided a great model that should be exemplary to other states who wish to introduce fixed-odds betting.</p>
