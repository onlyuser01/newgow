<p>It's not like having two accounts is going to make you benefit more from Casino Friday's giveaways or free spins because anybody that's played that site knows are free spins are nothing anyways, you never win on any of them you might get three free spins at 50 cents yay but does that would that benfit for me or anyone else two create a two accounts what they should be more worried about is duplicate players and I went above and beyond proving to them to guru that if that's not even the case. Casino Friday won't show evidence or proof of how this other account was even created they won't show the verification of the player nothing because they don't have it yet when I win they try to exploit their little over the rules and regulations by stating no duplicate accounts but yet the can't prove if it was a duplicate player so of course they let me spend $600 throughout the day laughing and having fun at my expense but up until I win and all of a sudden I'm laughing now that's when they pull the plug , this is not a very good website as clearly they only look out for themselves but at least the other casinos when they actually do that they actually fess up come clean and make amends out of it not like these guys. This is why they onlu have a 7.5 out of 10 rating and to have it that low for a casino thats so new is so disapointing. Maybe if I was reimbursed my total $600 we wouldn't be here right now I could have let bygones be bygones and so on and so on but here we are not only did they try and make their guilt by reimburse me a single $100 while they got to keep 2400 who won that one. I clearly stand by my decision that if my 6o0 isnt returned and or winnings then exploitation of a faulty gamesmanship should be told and perhaps only a matter of time before that 7.5 out of 10 is a 6 out of 10 so fourth and so on .</p>
