<p>PokerStars signs Neymar Jr. as a brand ambassador after a three-year hiatus and what is the first time PokerStars has signed up twice with the same ambassador.</p>
<p>Neymar Jr. Joins PokerStars as Brand Ambassador</p>
<p>Neymar Jr. is rejoining team PokerStars, bringing the player back for a renewed alliance after the pair’s last partnership expired in 2017. PokerStars is confident that Neymar Jr. is the “perfect fit,” and will help put the company’s name out there, and the present link-up will explore numerous aspects.</p>
<p>PokerStars usually has a play-and-go approach, signing successful ambassadors and being more than happy to let go once a contract runs its course, yet on this occasion, the world’s leading online poker card room is calling up on an old friend, who was recently spotted playing on GGPoker, a rival platform.</p>
<p>Neymar seemed excited to be joining PokerStars’ team just as well, arguing that playing cards is a favorite pastime of his and he definitely gets a few games while not playing football.</p>
<p>Neymar’s professed love for poker and card games in general comes from a sense of belonging and community, and the fun and unpredictable moments that can occur in any game, the press release explained.</p>
<p>“As a true poker fan, I am excited to start a new chapter with PokerStars. Together we’ll be creating moments for our community and fans all over the world,” the PSG strike had to add.</p>
<p>Neymar is indeed quite the poker popularity and he has been joining various tournaments. As part of the latest tie-up, PokerStars and Neymar introduced a short promotional video with the catchphrase “I am in”</p>
<p>Defining His Position within PokerStars</p>
<p>His role is still not fully defined, as PokerStars was a little cryptic about Neymar’s involvement with the brand right now, other than the “multiple aspects” mention. However, Neymar does have quite a bit of exposure on social media.</p>
<p>He’s currently sporting over 50 million followers on Twitter and his Instagram account has reached 143 million, bringing PokerStars’ brand exposure to the next level.</p>
<p>Commenting on these events, PokerStars Global Director of Brand and Creative Martin Nieri confirmed that Neymar’s status as a global star and his genuine love for poker made him the right fit for the organization.</p>
<p>“At PokerStars, we are constantly trying new things to bring new energy, excitement, and entertainment to our customers. Together with Neymar Jr we believe we can take this to the next level for the PokerStars community” Nieri added.</p>
<p>PokerStars is looking to move forward pursuing a different approach to the entertainment. In the renewed marketing efforts, PokerStars began airing safer gambling TV ads as part of a broader move to keep players safe.</p>
