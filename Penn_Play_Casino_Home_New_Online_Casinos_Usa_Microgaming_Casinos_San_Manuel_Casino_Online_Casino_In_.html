    <h1>Penn Play Casino Home New Online Casinos Usa Microgaming Casinos San Manuel Casino Online Casino In</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>i played with this casino and deposited around £270 or so</p>
<p>after playing for hours I had around £400 or so I tried to withdraw</p>
<p>the customer live chat told me I was still using bonus so I had to continue to play, I realised I was at 12% completed bonus after hours of playing slots.</p>
<p>I then began to think this is some kind of scam…. So I googled this site and found 98% 1 star reviews , I read every ones stories of not being able to withdraw and being ignored by the customer services.</p>
<p>so I continued to play knowing I probably wouldn’t get my funds even if I made it passed this impossible bonus .</p>
<p>but luckily I won £4000 on a feature , so I continued to play for hours and hours on end untill the bonus was finished.</p>
<p>luckily I ended up with around £5500 or non bonus funds , I tried to withdraw and got errors ,</p>
<p>they told me to verify my account and it would take up to 72 hours .</p>
<p>72 hours passed nothing happened , went onto chat they said they needed longer,</p>
<p>i played some more slots at £12.50 a spin for a few hours, went down to £2000 but managed to win £8900 total</p>
<p>as soon as I questioned live chat about my verification they noticed I won more then blocked me from playing anything else .</p>
<p>today I have checked my account and there is only £300 in there and customer service now ignores me and does not tell me why.</p>
<p>I mean I knew this was going to happen there are many stories of this , but such a shame I spent days playing and won the money fair and square</p>
<p>please help</p>
