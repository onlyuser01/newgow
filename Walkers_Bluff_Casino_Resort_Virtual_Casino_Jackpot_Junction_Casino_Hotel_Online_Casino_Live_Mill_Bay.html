    <h1>Walkers Bluff Casino Resort Virtual Casino Jackpot Junction Casino Hotel Online Casino Live Mill Bay</h1>

<p>The company is bullish on further expanding its online presence</p>
<p>Casino &amp; hospitality giant Mohegan has reinforced its leadership team with the addition of Guy Greene. The new appointee will serve as vice president of online marketing of the gambling company’s online casino division, helping it expand its footprint.</p>
<p>In his new role, Greene will be responsible for enacting the company’s marketing strategies and promoting its iGaming brands, including MoheganSunCasino in Connecticut and PlayFallsViewCasino in Ontario.</p>
<p>Greene is a long-time Mohegan employee who will now head the company’s online marketing team and will help it develop new marketing campaigns and acquisition initiatives that channel more players toward the platform. Greene will also be responsible for new product launches, customer relations management and promotional programs and products.</p>
<p>To that end, Greene will leverage his years of experience in marketing. Prior to his current role, he served as director of loyalty digital marketing at Mohegan and played a part in taking the Momentum loyalty program online. During his time in the role, Greene had the chance to collaborate with important Mohegan Digital partners.</p>
<p>Greene first became a member of the Mohegan team when the company opened its Mohegan Sun property in 1996. At first, he served as the casino resort’s player’s club manager but was eventually promoted to a number of major marketing positions.</p>
<p>President Roberts Is Glad to Have Greene on Board</p>
<p>Rich Roberts, Mohegan Digital’s president, commented on Greene’s appointment as vice president of online marketing of the division and praised his experience and profound understanding of the gambling industry’s intricacies.</p>
<p>Roberts added that Mohegan’s online casino business has been very successful so far. The company is bullish on further expanding its online presence and will therefore benefit a lot from the new appointment.</p>
<p>Our iGaming business has seen tremendous success and to carry that success forward, and to further evolve and meet new demands in this fast-growing industry, a proven leader like Greene will be vital. Rich Roberts, president, Mohegan Digital</p>
<p>Speaking of Mohegan’s marketing initiatives, the casino company recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of its flagship Momentum loyalty program. The program has been steadily evolving throughout the years, offering many exclusive benefits to patrons of the operator.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mohegan continues to develop its South Korean resort, in hopes of becoming a global gaming brand.</p>
