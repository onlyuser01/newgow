    <h1>Tropicana Online Casino Pa Detroit Motor City Casino Trump Casino Las Vegas Map Of Biloxi Casinos Ca</h1>

<p>I thought I'd write about my own experience with this particular casino just for fun, even though it probably won't make a difference. In hindsight, I started googling this casino and realized that many others have had similar issues with it. If I had read this information beforehand, I would have definitely skipped it. THIS CASINO IS ADVERTISED AS A QUICK CASINO, WHICH IT DEFINITELY IS NOT!</p>
<p>I deposited 20€, received a 100% bonus. The wagering requirement was only 4000€ and the maximum withdrawal 600€, should one happen to complete the wager. TERRIBLE BS. I wouldn’t recommend this casino to anyone. Stay far away.</p>
<p>Anyway, I succeeded in wagering and didn't violate any bonus rules. I tried to withdraw 400€ after completing the wagering process. Immediately on the site, it stated that the account needs to be verified before withdrawal. Quick casino? I had to send pictures of my driver's license, electricity bill, and account statement. I took a screenshot of the account and a photo from my laptop, as my bank hasn't provided anything in paper form for eons. I covered all the unnecessary details in the pictures of the electricity bill and account - neither were approved. Not even the electricity bill, because I covered the "important details". According to them, important details are the invoice amount and electricity consumption? What the hell??? Regarding the account picture: the only option is to have a paper document or pdf. The bank doesn't provide any account statements in paper form, it hasn't done in decades. I could download a pdf of last month's account statement from online banking, but I'm certainly not going to share information about my money transactions with anyone.</p>
<p>I provided feedback on these aspects and got a response in English (Customer service should also be in Finnish). The response did not remark anything about my concerns, just the usual rhetoric. In practice, they legally stole 20€ from me and left my entitled funds of 400€ untouched. My account remains open and the money sits there, where it will likely stay.</p>
<p>STAY AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN FROM THE BONUSBET QUICK CASINO. I RECOMMEND YOU LOOK UP OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES.</p>
