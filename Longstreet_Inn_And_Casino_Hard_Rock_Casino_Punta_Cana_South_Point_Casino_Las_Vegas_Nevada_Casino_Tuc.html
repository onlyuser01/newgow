<p>The Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas has opened odds on all 32 NFL teams making the playoffs, but as of now, the Cleveland Browns are no sure bet to reach the postseason.</p>

<p>No team is being more talked about than the Browns – a franchise that went 1-31 in 2016-2017, and 7-8-1 last season. Led by quarterback Baker Mayfield, the offseason acquisition of Odell Beckham Jr. and second-round NFL Draft pick Greedy Williams has provided Cleveland with new hopes for its long-struggling team.</p>
<p>Affectionately known as “Believeland” by its NBA Cavaliers fans, the city nickname is now fitting for the Dog Pound. But in Las Vegas, oddsmakers say the hype might be overdone.</p>
<p>It’s a really tough division,” SuperBook director John Murray told ESPN. “I think people are making a mistake if they write the Steelers off, the Ravens should be solid again, and the Bengals can’t help but be better with (coach) Marvin Lewis gone.”</p>
<p>As for the Browns making the postseason, the SuperBook has the odds even at Yes -110, No -110. The line essentially says there’s both a 52.38 percent chance that Cleveland will and will not reach the playoffs for the first time since 2002.</p>
<p>Browns Still Team to Beat</p>
<p>Despite the SuperBook having little conviction one way or another regarding Cleveland’s postseason chances, the Browns retain the shortest odds of winning the AFC North, an accomplishment they haven’t achieved since 1989 when the division was called the AFC Central.</p>
<p>The Browns are narrow AFC North favorites at +140. The odds imply a 41.67 percent chance of winning the division, with a $100 bet netting $140 should Cleveland prevail.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers trail closely at +150. The Baltimore Ravens are next at +300, and Cincinnati Bengals longshots at +2000.</p>
<p>One person who has plenty of confidence in his new team is draftee Williams. Following his selection, the LSU star told reporters, “I know one thing – that the Browns are going to the Super Bowl this year. That’s a fact.”</p>
<p>Updated Super Bowl Odds</p>
<p>Speaking of the big game, the SuperBook still has defending champs New England Patriots the favorite at 6/1. A $100 bet nets $600 should Tom Brady and company find a way to win the team’s fourth Super Bowl victory since 2014.</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are attracting plenty of action, as they too are at 6/1 to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Led by star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs are seeking their first NFL championship since 1970.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers lowered the Chiefs’ season over/under win total by a half-game after an audiotape featuring team wide receiver Tyreek Hill was released that suggests the NFL player intentionally broke his son’s arm.</p>
<p>After the Pats and Chiefs, the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints are at 8/1. The Indianapolis Colts round out the top five at 10/1. As for those Browns, Cleveland is at 16/1.</p>
