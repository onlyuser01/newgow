<p>Coolbet has been growing rapidly in the Latin American region and now the operator has decided to strengthen its pull with local crowds by focusing on dormant, non-depositing, and lapsed accounts and their owners.</p>
<p>To ensure that Coolbet has a stronger and better rapport with local audiences, the company has teamed up with Enteractive, an industry-leading specialist in the matters of reactivating players.</p>
<p>The partnership will see Enteractive work hard across the iGaming landscape and tap into Coolbet’s user base to help the operator achieve success in Latin America. The company will work on various projects for Coolbet, helping the operator execute comprehensive and added-value player activation campaigns in specific markets in the region.</p>
<p>Some of the targets of this collaboration will be registered non-funded player accounts as well as reactivation campaigns for lapsed players. Enteractive uses a unique almost unmatched approach in which the ReActivation Cloud platform used by the company mixes data and technology with a personal one-on-one experience.</p>
<p>Enteractive values personalization as its main way of reactivating consumers and places phone calls to ensure that the brand achieves its goal of reactivating players. In 2022 alone, the company reached out to 6.5m players and generated more than €51m in revenue for partner brands across the world.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity to work with Enteractive, Coolbet Head of Marketing Operations Julija Moisenko said that the brand was excited about working with the company and witnessing the unique player-engagement strategy first-hand.</p>
<p>"This partnership enables us to stand out from the competition and demonstrate to our players that we care about their experience. We are excited to see the results of this collaboration," Moisenko added.</p>
<p>Coolbet has of course been looking for target markets beyond Latin America, focusing on North America and Ontario, Canada in particular. Its most recent partnership with Enteractive can be later scaled to cover other regions, providing that both parties are satisfied with the results.</p>
<p>Enteractive Head of Business Development Andrew Foster was similarly excited to be embarking on this new journey with Coolbet. He said that his company is always prioritizing real one-on-one conversations in order to reactivate customers and help operators achieve the results they are after, bolstering their performance and brand strength as Enteractive goes along.</p>
