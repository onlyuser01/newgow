Legal and regulated</p>
<p>SSL-encrypted</p>
<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>22Bet is a leading sports betting firm with a sizeable offering and close to three years of operation. Launched in 2018, the website holds licenses from the Curacao eGaming Commission.</p>
<p>Our 22Bet review will focus on analyzing the available markets, the competitiveness of lines, odds and fixtures, mobile operations, banking options, and the overall safety of the sportsbook.</p>
<p>We have consulted sports fans that have used the betting firm and have impressions of what 22Bet provides in terms of all essential categories. For a complete picture, we have reviewed every detail ourselves.</p>
<p>22Bet gets many things right, including the intuitive desktop and user interface, banking options, bonuses and promotions, customer service, and a simple registration process that makes it easy to sign up.</p>
<p>22Bet Sports Betting Variety</p>
<p>22Bet has a comprehensive selection of sports betting markets, courtesy of a well-developed network of partners. Our 22Bet review counted as many as 70 different markets. Out of these, around 40 cover regular sports events whereas the others focus on virtual markets and electronic sports. 22Bet’s selection includes popular markets such as:</p>
<p>Football</p>
<p>Tennis</p>
<p>Basketball</p>
<p>Ice hockey</p>
<p>Volleyball</p>
<p>Table tennis</p>
<p>Golf</p>
<p>Boxing</p>
<p>Esports</p>
<p>Badminton</p>
<p>You will find political betting, horse racing, greyhound racing, martial arts, motorsports, and even squash.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there are dozens of available markets on EA sports simulator FIFA 21 with over 50 selections running at the time of this review. The available events per sport, however, will fluctuate depending on the time of the year and available contests.</p>
<p>The sportsbook has an extensive selection of live sports, too. At the time of composing this 22Bet review, we observed over 143 selections to bet on in real time. A true globe-trotter, 22Bet seemingly covers a sizeable number of competitions, including events across Europe, the United States, and even the Middle East.</p>
<p>Players are welcome to bet on both male and female competitions, individual and team sports, and explore betting opportunities in China, South Korea, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and many other countries.</p>
<p>Every sports list of major events has been covered at length so you may expect to find busy markets on popular contests such as the English Premier League (EPL), LaLiga, and Bundesliga for football for example.</p>
<p>For tennis, you are welcome to bet on all major events, including ATP. Under hockey, you can find available selections on the National Hockey League (NHL) and even NHL 20 Cyber League another sports-simulating game.</p>
<p>22Bet Live Betting and In-play Wagers</p>
<p>22Bet live wagers are some of the most comprehensive. While some sportsbooks tend to run only a few games at a time, 22Bet has a much more thorough approach, loading the In-play section with over 143 live markets when we checked in off-peak hours.</p>
<p>This means you have a fantastic selection of games to bet on in real-time. There is a good variety of available sports and a number of active events. When we reviewed 22Bet, we discovered:</p>
<p>Football (47)</p>
<p>Basketball (15)</p>
<p>Tennis (10)</p>
<p>Volleyball (16)</p>
<p>Table tennis (31)</p>
<p>There are plenty of other options, and especially electronic sports if you ever wish to bet on those. Some virtual simulations are very successful, including Formula E and iNASCAR, along with the NBA2K League, as an alternative to the NBA, and others.</p>
<p>The In-play experience at 22Bet is geared towards the traditional sports bettor, so you can expect to see quite a few things on your screen all at once. Filtering by sport will help you, but as soon as you click on a selection you will see upward of 30 possible outcomes to bet on, and often more.</p>
<p>22Bet live feels great and you can move your wagers promptly and without delays, which is key when betting on in-play markets. However, you cannot benefit from live streams as if you use the website from a desktop. Now, we don’t hold this to be too much of a drawback, as streams are usually delayed. This is resolved in the dedicated mobile app, though.</p>
<p>22Bet Betting Limits</p>
<p>22Bet has quite generous betting limits, which will come in handy if you are looking to place more sizeable bets. The maximum return from a betting contest is capped at $600,000 and the maximum odds for a single bet are 200. An accumulator bet allows the odds to go up to 500. Any single selection should be worth at least $0.20 giving sports bettors a bit of flexibility when it comes to making a bet.</p>
<p>Some sports may be restricted or limited in time or have a natural cap as to how much you can bet. For any bets exceeding the odds of return, you should contact customer support and discuss what your potential return would be and if a larger bet size is possible. In general, though, you want to calculate a return no larger than the set limit and run it by customer service to be sure.</p>
<p>Odds and Types of Bets to Choose From</p>
<p>Odds and fixtures are perfectly competitive and add value to your betting experience. You may further choose between US, UK, decimal, Hong Kong, Indonesian, or Malaysian in terms of what type of odds you prefer.</p>
<p>Digging into the specific types of bets you can place, they include quite a few options. You can bet directly on 1×2 or Moneyline, pick a Correct Score, Totals, or Spread. There are multiple Proposition Bets, which invite you to place a bet on a particular outcome related to a player or a team that is not as simple as which team would win.</p>
<p>Each sport has its own type of Prop Bets, but they can include things like Line-Call Challenges, Both Players to Win At Least One Set for tennis and Goals in Each Period, Handicap in Minute, Result in Minute for hockey, and others.</p>
<p>The bets will change depending on the sport, and there are usually dozens of selections spread across different, sports-specific categories.</p>
<p>22Bet Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>The 22Bet bonus and promotions section is packed with a variety of sportsbook-focused promotions depending on which country you access the site from, including a 100% match bonus of up to $300 if you’re a Canadian player. To activate the bonus, you will need to deposit $2. Clearing the welcome bonus requires you to bet the amount in accumulator bets five times (5x) at odds of at least 1.40. The bonus requires you to clear it within seven days of receiving it.</p>
<p>Fridays will bring you a Reload Sportsbook Bonus offering to charge your bankroll up by 150% up to $150. Another bonus allows you to recuperate some of your losses if you hit 20 losing bets in a row. 22Bet offers a special Accumulator of the Day promotion as well as a Weekly Rebate.</p>
<p>Overall, the bonus system at 22Bet is great. It’s worth noting that you would probably get access to different bonuses depending on your jurisdiction in terms of purely monetary values. The overall type of promotion usually carries over between markets.</p>
<p>22Bet Review of User Interface and Functionality</p>
<p>You do not need a 22Bet registration to access the entire user interface and browse the markets. To place a bet, however, you will need to complete a signup process, which usually takes a few minutes during which you need to provide your personal information truthfully.</p>
<p>Once you have this clear out of the way, you may enjoy the entire website, including in-play wagers, a dedicated mobile platform, and an intuitive bet slip that allows you to keep track of your ongoing bets, track historic results, and more.</p>
<p>22Bet has a busy look and it most certainly is. The website runs hundreds of markets, coefficients, and contests that are displayed at the very center of the website. While it may be a little overwhelming at first, the sportsbook uses intuitive filters that work well both on desktop, but also on 22Bet mobile.</p>
<p>Sports fans may use a slider menu to quickly navigate to the sport they wish, without any delays or difficulty. Once you identify a market you are happy with, all it takes to bet on it is to click or tap on the event and choose who you think will win.</p>
<p>As soon as you select your bet, you will be prompted to the Betting Slip, where you may enter the amount you are willing to put on a running bet.</p>
<p>Mobile Compatibility for Android and iOS</p>
<p>We were pleased that in our 22Bet review, we were part to experience the sportsbook on mobile. 22Bet has a very powerful mobile functionality powered by great website architecture and the use of modern mobile solutions.</p>
<p>While the entire functionality of the website is available directly through a browser, sports fans may also download a dedicated Android and iOS app which allows them great control over their betting experience. Sports fans may:</p>
<p>Place bets</p>
<p>Watch games</p>
<p>Cash out</p>
<p>Have 24/7 access</p>
<p>Both apps are built well enough to guarantee a uniformity of the sports betting experience at 22Bet. Players won’t have any issues regardless of their operating system.</p>
<p>22Bet Banking Options &amp; Payments</p>
<p>To make deposits and withdrawals simple, 22Bet uses a number of familiar payment methods. Sports bettors will be able to deposit their money free of charges and instantly with options such as Visa, MasterCard, Neteller and Skrill, and Discover as well as withdraw using the same payment methods.</p>
<p>22Bet has very flexible deposits and withdrawal limits starting at $1, making for quick cashouts. In addition, users can use Bank Transfer and even Bitcoin to alternate between the betting methods they feel the most comfortable with.</p>
<p>The truth is, 22Bet features close to 80 FIAT and cryptocurrency payment methods, and empowers the experience of sports bettors in new and exciting ways. There are options such as e-wallets, cash, payment systems, prepaid cards, bank transfer, and prepaid cards.</p>
<p>Customer Safety &amp; Security</p>
<p>To ensure the safety of bettors, 22Bet has established and followed clear protocols that prove the legitimacy of the sports betting firm in the first place. First, is the website’s development, which allows for a platform that is free of any flaws and allows for a quick and effortless betting experience.</p>
<p>Then, 22Bet ensures that all sports bets are safe and your information is as well thanks to the 256-bit protocol SSL encryption. Not least, 22Bet is accountable for all its operations, because it runs as a registered entity in Curacao and has a license to offer betting products remotely. This put together adds up very nicely to a safe and reliable sports betting experience.</p>
<p>22Bet Customer Support</p>
<p>22Bet customer support is quick and reliable, offering a neat way to be in touch with the sportsbook and community for any issue or pose any question. Players can get in touch using the live chat option or fill out a built-in email format for quick access to customer service.</p>
<p>Another way is to email directly to [email protected] by stating your name and the issue you need fixing. A dedicated support number is available at +357 99 816806 so if you prefer to talk to a customer rep over the phone, that is an option.</p>
