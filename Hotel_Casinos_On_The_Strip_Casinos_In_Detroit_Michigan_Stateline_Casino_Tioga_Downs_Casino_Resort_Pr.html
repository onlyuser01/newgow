    <h1>Hotel Casinos On The Strip Casinos In Detroit Michigan Stateline Casino Tioga Downs Casino Resort Pr</h1>

<p>Influencer marketing is a present-day form of marketing and advertising which oftentimes involves testimonial advertising by organizations or individuals via social media channels. For the last 10 years, the popularity of this activity has increased hundreds of times and currently, the people conducting it are known as influencers.</p>
<p>While some people might call this activity having a hobby, the influencers’ job is no different than any other person’s daily job. In fact, oftentimes influencers even do more and share with their audience personal activities and experiences. But why the influencer’s job became so popular? The growth of social media influence undoubtedly helped increase the number of influencers. According to a study by We Are Social from January 2019, approximately 45% of the world’s population or 3.5 billion people are active on social media.</p>
<p>Since this is a form of advertising, influencers can either receive payment for the promotion or receive a product or experience for free. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has outlined rules that influencers who have received payment in exchange for promotion must notify their audience. However, this is not the case when the influencer receives a product for free. In other words, if an influencer receives the product for free, it is up to them to choose whether to promote it or not.</p>
<p>Influencers Can Help the Gambling Industry Recover</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the economic impact brought by the COVID-19 pandemic to the casino industry, undoubtedly influencers can help the operators recover. One influencer who offers key insight into many casinos is Brian Christopher. His YouTube channel Brian Christopher Slots has nearly 300,000 subscribers and his views combined surpass 187 million. His exciting videos feature him playing slot games, high limit slots, and more. Christopher has been traveling all over the world and has presented hundreds of hours of exciting videos taken at famous casinos.</p>
<p>Born in Toronto, Canada, currently Christopher lives in Los Angeles, California. Although we cannot be sure how many casinos has he visited in California, Christopher has likely seen the inside of a significant number of venues, if not all. Only a few days ago, the famous influencer posted a video visiting Agua Caliente Casino in Rancho Mirage, California.</p>
<p>According to a recent article published by The Press-Enterprise, more casinos in Southern California are embracing the idea to bring influencers. Although casino entertainment is targeting a specific audience, the influencers who feature content similar to Brian Christopher can make a difference and bring more people to the casino floors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, upon reopening from the closure introduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, San Manuel Casino invited Christopher to attend along with other influencers on June 15. In his live broadcast, he played slots and also complimented the COVID-19 health and safety measures which included temperature screening, plexiglass spacers, and more.</p>
