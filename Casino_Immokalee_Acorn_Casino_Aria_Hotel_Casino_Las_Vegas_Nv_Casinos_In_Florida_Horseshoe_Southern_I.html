    <h1>Casino Immokalee Acorn Casino Aria Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Casinos In Florida Horseshoe Southern I</h1>

<p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) announced that it has requested the blocks of several more illegal offshore gambling websites and affiliate marketing websites. The regulatory body contacted Internet service providers in Australia, asking them to block access to the domains in question.</p>
<p>The new ban wave saw the ACMA request the bans of eight websites in total. According to the ACMA, recent investigations found that the concerned sites were operating in breach of Australia’s Interactive Gambling Act 2001. As a result, their operations should be immediately blocked.</p>
<p>The ACMA listed the websites it requested blocks against. They include the following brands:</p>
<p>Casino Jax</p>
<p>Mirax Casino</p>
<p>Wild Fortune Casino</p>
<p>Kosmonaut Casino</p>
<p>Slotozen</p>
<p>Rolling Slots</p>
<p>N1 Bet Casino</p>
<p>No Deposit Kings</p>
<p>These are only the latest sites the ACMA took action against.</p>
<p>ACMA Continues the War on Offshore Sites</p>
<p>The authority has been working hard to prevent illegal online gambling operators from accessing the local regulated market. The ACMA has been waging this war on unlicensed websites for years now and has successfully blocked a total of 709 offshore operators and affiliates.</p>
<p>The regulator began its crusade against unlicensed websites in 2017 when it started to strictly enforce the offshore gambling rules. As a result, more than 180 illegal services ceased their operations in the Australian market.</p>
<p>The regulator used its latest ban wave as an opportunity to remind consumers that offshore websites can be very dangerous. The regulator pointed out that since such websites are illegal, they are not obliged to pay out winnings. Even if offshore operators seem legitimate, they may still not offer sufficient player protections to shield their customers from fraud or problem gambling.</p>
<p>The ACMA also pointed out that Australian customers can check the full list of licensed wagering services in its official register. It also urged customers to check the ACMA website for additional information on legal gambling, as well as advice on how to spot and report an unlicensed site.</p>
<p>In February, the ACMA further expanded its file of illegal gambling websites, adding 24 Casino, Olympia Casino, Pokie Surf, Stellar Spins, Boomerang Casino and Rock n Reels to the list.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the ACMA reached an agreement with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office to combat unsolicited calls and texts, as well as phone scams. The two parties penned a Memorandum of Understanding to work together and share crucial intelligence. The bodies will assist each other in investigations, working harder to secure the safety of customers in the UK and Australia.</p>
