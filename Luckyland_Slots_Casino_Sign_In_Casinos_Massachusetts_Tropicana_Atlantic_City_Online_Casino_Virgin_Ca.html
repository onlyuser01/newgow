    <h1>Luckyland Slots Casino Sign In Casinos Massachusetts Tropicana Atlantic City Online Casino Virgin Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Toper,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.bluvegas.com/bonus-terms:</p>
<p>"Other Terms</p>
<p>2.9. Different games and game types contribute towards fulfilling wagering requirements to different extents. For instance, if a game type delivers 100% towards wagering, it means that if you bet €1, €1 will count towards completion of the wagering. Below are the games’ bonus wagering contribution rates:</p>
<p>Slot games: 100% (aside from list below which we reserve the right to update and forfeit any winnings if bonus funds are wagered on these games.)*</p>
<p>All other games: 0%</p>
<p>*Slot games: Mega Joker, Mega Moolah, Avalon, II, Scratch, Midas Gold, Aztec Idols, Bork the Berzerker Hack n Slash, Cash Splash, Mystery Joker 6000, Casino Win Spin, Mystery Reels, Castle Builder, Osiris, Persian Fortune, Dead or Alive, Dead or Alive 2, Deck The Halls, Power Force Villains, Devil’s Delight, Railroad, Football Champions Cup, Reels of Wealth, Robin Hood, Santas Wild Ride, Fruit Warp, Spina Colada, Good Girl Bad Girl, Immortal Romance, The Tipsy Tourist, Treasure Nile, Joker Pro, Jokerizer, Vampires, Leprechaun Goes to Hell, Wild Spartans, Lucky Little Devil, Wild Swarm, Lucky Little Gods, Wild West, Medusa II Jackpots, Wild Wheel, Great Book of Magic, Table/Live casino games are restricted during bonus wagering and your winnings will be voided if you wager on any of the above mentioned games."</p>
<p>However, we believe that restricted games should be blocked, and this rule enforced at software level, i.e., that the casino's software or website shouldn't let players place bets on the games that are not allowed to be played. Could you please forward your game history in Excel format to petronela.k@casino.guru?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve your problem as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
