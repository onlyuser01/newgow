<p>The leading iGaming affiliate, Catena Media, announced an important senior-level appointment today. The company confirmed that its board of directors decided to appoint the seasoned executive, Sean Hurley, as non-executive director. Joining Catena, he fills in the role that was vacated by Per Widerström back in August this year. At the time, Widerström said that he decided to step down and take on the position of chief executive officer at 888 Holdings.</p>
<p>Catena confirmed that Hurley’s appointment to its board of directors will come into effect once the required regulatory filings with the Malta Business Registry are completed. The company revealed that the term of the new non-executive director would last through the end of its next annual general meeting. This requirement, Catena said, is in line with the Maltese Companies Act as well as the company’s articles of association.</p>
<p>Ahead of the appointment of the new non-executive director, Catena confirmed the divestment of its Italian assets earlier this month. At the time, the company revealed that the divestment of its casino and sports assets in Italy was completed in two details totaling $21.7 million. This achievement also marked the completion of its strategic review that sought to boost the company’s focus on markets across the Americas.</p>

Finally, Hurley explained: “I am delighted to have been asked to contribute my expertise as the company moves forward and further strengthens its position as a leading affiliate in North America.”</p>
<p>“Catena Media has entered an exciting new phase in its development and has a promising future ahead.“ Sean Hurley, non-executive director at Catena Media</p>
<p>As a seasoned expert, Hurley brings a wide range of skills and knowledge from the betting and gaming sectors. Overall, he spent more than 13 years within the vertical, proving himself as a leading advisor, experienced executive and investor. Throughout his extensive career within the sports betting, casino and social gaming sectors, Hurley held different important senior-level positions related to affiliate and business-to-consumer relations. He also held important positions related to the business-to-business sector.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Catena posted its Q3 results, showing a revenue decrease of 28% year-over-year. Besides revenue, the company’s adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations halted at $3.4 million, representing a decrease of 65%.</p>
