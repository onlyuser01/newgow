    <h1>Casino Heist Fingerprint Casino In Livingston Royal Casino Cast Ellis Island Casino Brewery Sevenwin</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've another dispute here after got paid;/ I've redepositted once (210eur) and lost and again 212eur and here won up to 560eur in balance (with small bets max 5eur) then decided to bet on live roulette (high 432 eur bet) and this was my unlucky move because I've won it (now balance 1004e) then requested withdrawal of 750eur but immediately after that support contacted me that I can't bet over 20% of my deposit which I accepted and told them that I haven't seen this rule and I will follow the rules in the future and I'm sorry but unfortunately they have removed WHOLE winnings - not only this one hight bet winnings but also whole winnigns from the previously low bets and put only last deposit balance of 212 on my account.</p>
<p>I contacted them but they say that this is fair because I've bet more than 20% of bet so they had to remove all winnings, I told them that I'm sorry and accepting to remove my last bet winnings to be removed but everything before was legit from low bets and I will follow this rule in future but they are not accepting this.</p>
<p>This is very unfair for me - can You please help me to fight with them - as this is unacceptable that they took all winnings and not only this very one high bet winnings which is acceptable for me. I have also screens + email from them and livechat transcript if You need.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
