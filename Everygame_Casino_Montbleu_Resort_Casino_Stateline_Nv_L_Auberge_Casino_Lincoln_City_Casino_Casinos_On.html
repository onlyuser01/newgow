<p>The following complaint was addressed to www.thepogg.com who despite their effort could not resolve my issue.</p>
<p>Complaint: Found for the Player</p>
<p>https://thepogg.com/complaint/videoslots-sow-lockout/</p>
<p>Was requested SOW after trying to withdraw $2652.48 in April, 2022 which agreed and uploaded them online via chat support. After waiting a week without any updates I contacted support who then notified me that my banking activities for the months of January, February, March were needed which I agreed to and uploaded the information requested by me via online chat support. Again waiting a week without hearing back from the payment and risk analyst department who was reviewing my SOW I once more contacted in game support inquiring any updates. Chat again advise me that they required details to specific transactions that I felt was irrelevant and expressed to chat that I felt like personal information was being violated due to frustration I logged out. After cooling down I attempted to log in but was locked out of my account. A few days later I received an email advising me that my account will be restricted until the responsible gaming department contacts me. After two weeks I was contacted by the above mentioned team and agreed to a self seclusion. After two weeks I had sent a demand letter regarding payment for the remaining balance in my account. Since June 29, 2022 I’ve been waiting for the payments team to find the solution to the ongoing manual failed attempts to the bank information I have on file that I have in the past successfully made withdrawals into over the 2.5 years of my account with Videoslots. I don’t know what else I could do and it’s almost going on five months stressfully dealing with my cash out.</p>
<p>I have contacted Madre and made a complaint in November, but have not received anything but confirmation that my complaint has been submitted.</p>
<p>Seeing that the operator still did not have a solution to successfully execute manual transactions to Canadians, on Jan 8, 2023 I had confirmed that my self exclusion had ended and I requested to gain access into my account and that a manual withdrawal was no longer needed and my issues was finally going to be resolved if I made that transaction myself.</p>
<p>I am still waiting for the department to review my request . After the first and second week of not hearing back, the operators excuses were the department was backed up with work and that I will get an email soon. And today I am told my request is under review by the department. I've told them there should be no reason to review my request and that they are violating my rights to freely withdrawal the funds that lawfully belong to me. Should I be compensated for the breach of my human rights?</p>
<p>Is this something casino guru can help resolve or provide advise to other option I may have in my situation?</p>
