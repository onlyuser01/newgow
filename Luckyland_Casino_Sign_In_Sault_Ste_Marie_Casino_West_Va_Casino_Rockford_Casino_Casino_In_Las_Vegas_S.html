    <h1>Luckyland Casino Sign In Sault Ste Marie Casino West Va Casino Rockford Casino Casino In Las Vegas S</h1>

<p>Vladimir Malakchi, Chief Commercial Officer, was a special guest to Casino Guru News at SBC Summit Barcelona 2023. In an insightful interview about the origins and the mission of Evoplay as a company, Malakchi takes a much broader approach to explaining what has motivated the brand and pushed it forward.</p>
<p>The industry, he argued, was a rather boring place four years ago, but innovation started to trickle in not least because of a growing consumer appetite for experimentation and newness. Evoplay decided to embark on this quest for innovation early on, seeing its efforts pay off today.</p>
<p>The key is to ensure that retention rates are high, but not do so by overly-complicating games and features, he reflects.</p>
<p>Many companies miss the mark by thinking that building up a more complex game is what players need, but this isn’t necessarily true, and not in Malakchi’s opinion certainly. Simple themes, simple games, but with the right mix of cleverly-designed additional tools is what it takes to drive differentiation, engage, and retain customers.</p>
<p>To find out more about how Evoplay has gone from a company venturing into the unknown to a supplier that is sought out by the industry’s hottest operators, check out our full interview with Malakchi.</p>
