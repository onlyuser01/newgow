<p>Las Vegas Sands announced the biggest to date reinvestment plan for its Singapore integrated resort Marina Bay Sands as all industry eyes are on the recovery of global tourism.</p>
<p>Commitment to Hospitality Experiences</p>
<p>The $1 billion reinvestment plan spanning hotel rooms and suites, new food and beverage offerings and other enhancements is the latest display of the parent company’s commitment to Singapore and the country’s tourism industry.</p>
<p>The new reinvestment will build on the multi-billion expansion announced in April 2019 that sought to bring in a state-of-the-art entertainment arena, an ultra-luxury hotel tower and additional meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibition (MICE) space adjacent to the integrated resort.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Las Vegas Sands’ Chairman and chief executive officer Robert Goldstein underlined the company’s “confidence in the future” and its “commitment to offering industry-leading luxury products and hospitality experiences.”</p>
<p>“We are firmly of the view that Asia will continue to lead as a primary driver of growth in travel, and Singapore will remain a top destination of choice. Our reinvestment, as well as our planned multi-billion-dollar expansion that we announced in 2019, represent a further demonstration of our long-term support for Singapore.” Robert Goldstein, CEO, Las Vegas Sands</p>
<p>The new reinvestment that is part of the ongoing program across Las Vegas Sands properties in Macao and Singapore features extensive upgrading of all Tower 1 and Tower 2 hotel rooms and suites that is scheduled to complete in phases over 2022 and 2023 and aimed to elevate the hospitality experience in the luxury segment.</p>
<p>At the Core of Las Vegas Sands’ Operations</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands already dedicated approximately $2.2 billion for its Macao properties The Londoner Macao, Grand Suites at Four Seasons Macao and The Londoner Court.</p>
<p>The renovation will also include a revamped Executive Club lounge, premium fine dining and health and wellness amenities for high-value travelers across the 55th floor of all three hotel towers of the resort.</p>
<p>“Marina Bay Sands’ new room and suite offerings will bring luxury lifestyle experiences not seen in the market before, as we reimagine the future of luxury hospitality and travel.” Paul Town, COO, Marina Bay Sands</p>
<p>Excited in anticipation as the resort is about to unveil its new amenities in the months ahead, Town also outlined the role of the government towards the safe return of global travel, stressing its “calibrated approach and unwavering support for the industry.” The recent extension to 2030 of the country’s two integrated resorts’ exclusivity was part of the government’s commitment.</p>
<p>One of the first new amenities that will be available to Marina Bay Sands visitors will be Wakuda restaurant, part of celebrity Chef Tetsuya Wakuda signature restaurants and created by restaurateur John Kunkel of the 50 Eggs Hospitality Group, while The Shoppes will continue to expand its unique shopping experiences by bringing in new concepts to help the resort to deliver a well-rounded experience.</p>
