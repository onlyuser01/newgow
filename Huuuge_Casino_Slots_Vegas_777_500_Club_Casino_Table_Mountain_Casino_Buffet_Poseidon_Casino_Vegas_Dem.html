<p>Gibraltar-based online gaming and entertainment group 888 Holdings announced an existing partnership with iGaming provider Pariplay was extended to launch its casino titles in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to expand on our long-term partnership with Pariplay.” Guy Cohen, Senior Vice President, B2C, 888 Holdings</p>
<p>Successful Formula</p>
<p>The deal extension between the gaming group and the aggregator platform provider follows the successful launch of 888’s casino titles by Pariplay for gamers in the UK, Romania and Italy. The supplier of the Fusion aggregation platform and the Ignite Studio development program entered the Spanish market in November, 2020, after a partnership with MGA Games, a casino brand under the 888 umbrella.</p>
<p>“It’s incredibly rich, exciting titles will be loved by our customers in Spain and Portugal while marking another opportunity for us to expand our premium casino content. We look forward to continuing our agreement with Pariplay into 2021.” Guy Cohen, Senior Vice President, B2C, 888 Holdings</p>
<p>The Pariplay partnership would allow 888 customers across 888casino.es and 888casino.pt websites gain access to the aggregator’s content suite, including titles such as Wolf Riches, Mystic Manor, Rumble Rhino and Dragons of the North.</p>
<p>“We are really excited about rolling out our games to players at 888casino in Spain and Portugal in line with our commitment to expanding our footprint in regulated markets. With 888casino at the helm, we have a perfect partnership for making this happen.” Christine Lewis, Chief Commercial Officer, Pariplay</p>
<p>888 Continues to Beef Up Offerings</p>
<p>The deal extension is the latest in a series of the concerted efforts by 888 to expand on its product offering by adding a new range of slot, card and table games, as well as live dealer titles.</p>
<p>Last month, 888 Holdings entered into a content partnership deal with slot developer EGT Interactive to expand its product offering by the addition of some of the premium gaming content of the slot supplier, including its Zodiac Wheel, Burning Hot, Book of Magic, Shining Crown, and Amazons’ Battle marquee titles.</p>
<p>The deal with EGT Interactive was initially targeting the Romanian market but could also prove pivotal for other markets in which both partners have mutual interest including Spain, Portugal and Italy.</p>
<p>With product and market expansion, as well as the hidden potential related to the opportunity to acquire the European business of William Hill following the acquisition of the UK-based sports betting operator by the US casino giant Caesars Entertainment, it was no surprise investment banking company Peel Hunt placed 888 on its top picks list for growth potential in 2021.</p>
