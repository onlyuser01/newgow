<p>Sports content and integrity services provider Genius Sports Limited is stepping on Ohio ground with a new Sports Gaming Supplier License granted to the company by the Ohio Casino Control Commission.</p>
<p>With the new license addition in Ohio, Genius Sports currently has acquired a total of 39 licenses throughout the whole of North America. This includes not only various US states but also tribal territories and areas in Canada.</p>
<p>Ohio License Comes Ahead of Sports Betting Launch in the State</p>
<p>The Ohio license comes just in time for the sports betting market launch in the state which is scheduled for January 1, 2023. There are forecasts that Ohio is going to become the leading sports betting state in the US so Genius Sports could not have had better timing.</p>
<p>Mark Locke, CEO of Genius Sports, also acknowledged this by saying:</p>
<p>As a growing majority of US states legalize sports betting, Genius Sports welcomes the opportunity to work with states like Ohio, on providing sports fans with official sports data-driven solutions to power their sportsbooks. Mark Locke, CEO, Genius Sports</p>
<p>Locke also added that Genius Sports is proud and honored that the company received a license in Ohio and will be offering it state-of-the-art marketing and NFL products in the state.</p>
<p>Research Claims Ohio Will Become #1 Sports Betting US State in 2023</p>
<p>The state of Ohio legalized sports betting in December 2021 and is expected to officially launch the market on January 1, 2023. Over 25 sports betting operators have already attained licenses to provide sports betting services in the state, which is a good foundation for a very competitive and thriving market.</p>
<p>According to the latest research conducted by BonusFinder, the state of Ohio with its population of 12 million is on its way to becoming the number one sports wagering state in the US in 2023. The research highlights that there is an avid sports fan base in the state due to numerous Ohio professional sports league teams.</p>
<p>Ohio is the home of two NFL teams – the Cincinnati Bengals and the Cleveland Browns. It also has an NHL team – the Columbus Blue Jackets. Furthermore, the MLB teams the Cincinnati Reds and the Cleveland Guardians, and the NBA team the Cleveland Cavaliers are also from Ohio.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Has Recently Taken More Market Share in Canada</p>
<p>Ohio is not the only new addition to Genius Sports’ advancement into new territories. In November the company signed a new agreement with Canadian sports betting operators Rivalry, Bet99, and bet365 for the live-streaming of NFL content with the help of Genius Sports’ “Watch &amp; Bet” program.</p>
<p>The three operators will be able to stream regular and off-season NFL games to their customers. What is unique about Genius Sports’ “Watch &amp; Bet” is that it offers sports fans an enhanced visual experience through the use of machine learning, optical tracking, and sophisticated live-streaming technology.</p>
