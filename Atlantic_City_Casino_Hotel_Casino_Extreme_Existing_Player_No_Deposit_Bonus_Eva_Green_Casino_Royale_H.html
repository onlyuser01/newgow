    <h1>Atlantic City Casino Hotel Casino Extreme Existing Player No Deposit Bonus Eva Green Casino Royale H</h1>

<p>Hey guys, I want to share my experience with 7BitCasino's Welcome Race 2.0 tournament.</p>
<p>I was really excited to participate and ended up placing first in the tournament. According to the rules, I was supposed to receive 200 Free Spins in Wild Cash Slot by BGaming. However, when I received the free spins and opened the slot, I found out that each spin was worth only 0.01 cents.</p>
<p>﻿﻿</p>
<p>I was shocked and immediately contacted support, thinking that this must be a mistake. However, they assured me that it was correct. This was not mentioned anywhere in the terms and conditions or on the website, and it was very misleading. I had to wager thousands of euros to win the tournament, and free spins I received were worth only 2 euros (0.01 * 200). It was a huge disappointment.</p>
<p>The minimum bet to participate in the tournament was real money bets of €0.5 / $0.5 / A$0.8 / C$0.7 / NZ$0.9 / 5 NOK / 30 RUB / 2.4 PLN / 72 JPY / 2.6 BRL / 0.000026 BTC / 0.0005 ETH / 0.005 BCH / 0.01 LTC, which is not a small amount. It's unfair to receive a prize that is worth so little after placing first in the tournament.</p>
<p>I had been satisfied with 7BitCasino until this incident, but now I have serious doubts about their integrity. The casino has the right to change the rules of the tournament at any time without prior notice, but this kind of psychological false advertisement and scams is not acceptable. I urge other players to be careful before participating in any tournaments or races at 7BitCasino.</p>
<p>On top of this issue, I would like to bring to your attention another problem I encountered while playing here.</p>
<p>Recently, I managed to reach the fourth VIP level by betting and wagering large amounts of real money. However, I was shocked to find out that I have not received the bonuses for the first three VIP levels as promised, except for the 75 free spins from the fourth level.</p>
<p>I have fulfilled all the requirements for each VIP level by betting and wagering accordingly, and I was supposed to receive the following bonuses for each level:</p>
<p>10 Free spins for Level 1</p>
<p>Level Up Bonus, 30 Free spins, and Monday bonus of 30 Free spins for Level 2</p>
<p>Level Up Bonus, 50 Free spins, and Monday bonus of 50 Free spins for Level 3</p>
<p>It's disappointing and frustrating that I have spent a significant amount of money and time to reach these levels and have not been given the benefits that I have earned as a loyal customer at 7BitCasino. I find this extremely unfair and unjustified.</p>
<p>I have already raised this issue to their customer service, and I am requesting that they immediately add the bonuses that I have earned to my account as per the VIP program</p>
<p>Just wanted to share my experience and warn others. Stay safe and happy gaming!</p>
