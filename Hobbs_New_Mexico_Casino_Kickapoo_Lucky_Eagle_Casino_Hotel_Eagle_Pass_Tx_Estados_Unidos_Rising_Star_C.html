<p>Sportsbet.io, one of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency betting companies, has announced that it is adding four new ambassadors to its "Join the Crypto Experience" program and team of ambassadors.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io has been firmly focused on building a team of international celebrities and prominent personalities who can help promote the brand’s message and raise awareness for its operations in numerous markets across the globe.</p>
<p>The new ambassadors have been hand-picked by the company as well, featuring Sean Andrew, who will be promoting the brand across the African region.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to join the crypto experience and share my passion for lifestyle, travel and fashion with the Sportsbet.io community," Andrew stated. Another new ambassador is Faith Nthenya Mutwa who is a digital creator and social media personality who uses her art to drive positive and meaningful change in the world, the official press release details.</p>
<p>Kerry Martin makes the third ambassador cut and he is a well-known media personality in Kenya, having more than nine years on TV and radio in the country. All three ambassadors hail from Kenya.</p>
<p>The last addition to the team is Thompson S. Ekong, known by his moniker TSE, who is a visual artist and who will also work with Sportsbet.io to help elevate the brand’s standing and promote its core message.</p>
<p>The Join the Crypto Experience program is designed to be a down-to-earth ambassador alliance whereby Sportsbet.io is able to identify popular personalities who hold clout in their respective countries and bring them into the fold.</p>
<p>The result is increased brand awareness for the company along with organic and unintrusive forms of advertisement. Sportsbet.io has been a known innovator. The company has turned to cryptocurrency payments, attempting to lead the crypto betting revolution, and broadly succeeding.</p>
<p>Its commitment to building strong rapport with local communities has been equally impressive. Last year, the operator teamed up with Low6 to offer Clubhouse experiences that were designed to engage better with customers and make them enjoy their time with the platform more.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io also does not make use of traditional bonuses, replacing them with improved odds, the occasional booster, and an immaculate platform that enables pre-game and in-play wagers.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io is the property of Yolo Group, which recently restructured its operations, splitting its focus into three main verticals in a bid to strengthen business performance and drive stronger results across the board.</p>
