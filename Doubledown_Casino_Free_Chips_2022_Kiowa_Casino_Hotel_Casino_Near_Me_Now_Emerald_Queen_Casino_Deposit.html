<p>Zitro’s online arm, Zitro Digital, has scored a new partnership with EveryMatrix, a leading B2B provider of iGaming solutions. As per the agreement, EveryMatrix will help some of Zitro’s best retail titles go online.</p>
<p>Several Zitro Games Will Go Online</p>
<p>According to the deal, EveryMatrix will integrate Zitro’s hit land-based games into CasinoEngine, its proprietary iGaming integration platform. Consequently, Zitro’s best retail titles will be available to online audiences for the first time.</p>
<p>The deal will help online gamblers experience some of Zitro’s critically-acclaimed games on the web. This will include cutting-edge titles such as Link King, Link Me and the whole Zitro Digital video bingo library.</p>
<p>The agreement continues Zitro’s expansion efforts as the company seeks to broaden its audience and appeal to more bettors. To that end, the company recently launched a new multi-game called Wheel of Legendstitle to its retail customers in Spain. Visitors of Casino Barcelona and Casino Peralada can now experience the new game.</p>
<p>In April, Zitro Digital expanded its footprint in California by inking deals with several of the state’s casinos. As a result, the company powered local venues with 88 of its Link products.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Hope for a Long-Term Partnership</p>
<p>José Javier Martí, the chief operating officer of Zitro Digital, addressed the new deal, saying that he is optimistic about it. He said that his team is happy about the opportunity to work with EveryMatrix and lauded the company’s proven solutions. Because of them, Martí is sure that the agreement will be beneficial and will help Zitro Digital expand and reach more bettors.</p>
<p>In addition, Martí teased that Zitro Digital is planning to integrate more titles in the near future.</p>
<p>It’s a great opportunity for Zitro Digital to expand its online business worldwide, and we look forward to integrating more game titles soon. José Javier Martí, COO, Zitro Digital</p>
<p>Amund Stensland, the chief operating officer of the CasinoEngine platform, also shared his thoughts. He said he is happy to add Zitro Digital’s content to CasinoEngine’s portfolio and is looking forward to working with Zitro. Stensland added that he hopes this is the start of a long-term collaboration.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, we will offer our clients a few new games with proven performance. We are looking forward to a long-lasting and successful partnership. Amund Stensland, COO, CasinoEngine</p>
<p>A month ago, EveryMatrix managed to successfully acquire a license to operate in West Virginia. Earlier, EveryMatrix also locked a key deal with International Game Technology, allowing it to distribute games with IGT’s proprietary features.</p>
