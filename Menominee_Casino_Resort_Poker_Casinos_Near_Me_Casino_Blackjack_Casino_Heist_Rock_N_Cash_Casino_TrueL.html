<p>TrueLab Game Studios has become the latest developer to enter First Look Games, a powerful platform that allows affiliates and partner businesses to have an early look at upcoming releases and prepare promotional materials that ultimately help developers to market their titles more successfully.</p>
<p>TrueLab Games Gets Powerful Gateway to Consumers</p>
<p>As a result, TrueLab Games Studios’ upcoming titles will be available for a sneak peek preview by more than 800 trusted affiliate partners who help developers increase awareness for their products. Put together, the affiliates reach more than 20 million people globally.</p>
<p>The assets uploaded onto the First Look Games’ platform include various logos, images, and videos from the games available there that can be downloaded in bulk and help navigate any further promotional efforts undertaken by affiliates.</p>
<p>TrueLab is still in control via the Studio Management Center which allows the company to highlight exclusive agreements and remove jurisdictions for specific titles as necessary. Commenting on this partnership opportunity, First Look Games managing director Tom Galanis said:</p>
<p>Affiliates are a powerful marketing platform for studios, offering tremendous reach and direct access to player communities. It is great to see TrueLab use the First Look Games to better promote the studio and drive awareness of its games. First Look Games managing director Tom Galanis</p>
<p>Galanis explained that studios would spend too much time and resources – that they often didn’t have – if they tried to reach out to individual affiliates on their own. First Look Games makes this process quick, easy, and impactful, the managing director explained.</p>
<p>Conserving Resources to Have Maximum Impact</p>
<p>TrueLab Game Studios head of marketing Karl von Brockdorff said that affiliates are an important channel to ensure that games reach more consumers. He acknowledged that First Look Games makes it possible for game developers to focus on the development process, knowing they have a trusted partner to help them with raising awareness for said products in a meaningful and robust way.</p>
<p>“This is what makes this such an important partnership for TrueLab, and we look forward to increasing the exposure of our games via some of the biggest publishers in the business,” von Brockdorff concluded.</p>
