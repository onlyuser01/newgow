<p>The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe Nation is introducing gaming space for patrons aged 55 or older at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut for November.</p>
<p>Patrons of the 80s Welcome at Foxwoods Resort Casino</p>
<p>Foxwoods Resort Casino is changing its strategy and will now run a part of its gaming floor as an area specifically earmarked for patrons who are 55 or older this November. The property based in Mashantucket, Connecticut is looking to entice older crowds and ensure that everyone is having a good time. Foxwoods revealed the area with a special party welcoming the older demographics to turn up along and have a blast.</p>
<p>Foxwoods has described the initiative as a “time to let the grown-ups play.” In addition, the property has adhered to all safety and sanitization protocols, enforcing social distance at Rainmaker Casino in Foxwoods which will now host the 55-or-older patrons starting at 10 am to midnight every weekend.</p>
<p>The initiative will extend throughout November and it will come with a number of tailored solutions, including themed slot machines. Foxwoods is bringing some of the 80s classics to the casino floor and welcomes patrons to get their Foxwoods Rewards Card and start racking up Fox Perxs by playing any of their favorite slot machines.</p>
<p>The property will extend complimentary beverages and serve Happy Hour cocktails with by Bones Farm and kamakazis. This initiative compliments Foxwoods Casino’s push to restart indoors entertainment, with the Grand Theater reopening at 25% capacity.</p>
<p>Foxwoods Recovering in the Post Covid-19 Environment</p>
<p>One of the most significant demographics for the casino experience, older patrons have been the first to flee casinos since the coronavirus pandemic was introduced back in March, followed by hard time for the industry. Now, casinos are trying to entice patrons back, and Foxwoods approach relies on exclusivity.</p>
<p>Foxwoods has been able to stay fairly unscathed all things considered, with the Mashantucket Pequot tribe reopening in June. The move resulted in fairly strong revenue for the company. However, traffic has petered out and the tribe is now looking into tailored solutions for each of its properties to boost numbers up.</p>
<p>Foxwoods is only operating at a 25% capacity, though, as mandated by state laws, limiting the scope of recovery. Yet, the Foxwoods brand has a lot to be happy about. The property was listed as one of the best casinos outside of Las Vegas in a recent USA Today polling, giving the casino and resort a significant awareness boost.</p>
<p>Foxwoods is further convinced in its capacity to maintain a safe gaming experience for everyone. In a statement, the company had this to say, reassuring patrons of its ability to keep everyone safe:</p>
<p>“Foxwoods continues to hold a positive safety track record driven by guests and team members continually respecting health protocols and maintaining social distancing.” -Foxwoods Resort Casino</p>
<p>Foxwoods will have to comply with state rules, however, and Connecticut is right now in the process of reintroducing new restrictions as part of the state’s Phase 2.1, part of the state’s broader plan for restarting the economy.</p>
<p>Governor Ned Lamont, however, has introduced an order to have all commercial restaurants and entertainment facilities shut down by 9:30 pm every night, biting into the receipts of such venues, as they rely on patrons coming in after 10:00 pm. Yet, this temporary setback has not stopped back Foxwoods to experiment.</p>
