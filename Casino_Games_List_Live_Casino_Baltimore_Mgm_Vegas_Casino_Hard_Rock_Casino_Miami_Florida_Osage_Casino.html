    <h1>Casino Games List Live Casino Baltimore Mgm Vegas Casino Hard Rock Casino Miami Florida Osage Casino</h1>

<p>The online brand which has been constantly growing over the past years has reached a new milestone with its 10,000th online game title</p>
<p>Videoslots now officially has more than 10,000 titles in its library and is the first online casino to have achieved this significant milestone. Launched in 2011, the company has been working tirelessly towards this accomplishment.</p>
<p>More Than 10,000 Games to Enjoy</p>
<p>The latest achievement is possible with the help of RAW iGaming’s Raging Super2Ways, which is the latest game to join the operator and will be available in multiple regions where the necessary licenses have been obtained.</p>
<p>This new development is doubly impressive when considering that Videoslots launched its 9,000th title in January 2023 and has managed to add 1,000 new games in the seven months since. There are presently more than 200 suppliers that work with Videoslots to create the world’s biggest library of online casino games.</p>
<p>Videoslots has confirmed that it is going to be focusing on moving forward with the new milestone – 11,000 games and well beyond that benchmark. The company has not provided information as to when this may be achieved, but a fair estimate would be by early next year, which means Videoslots is most likely to retain its position as the largest B2C repository of online casino games.</p>
<p>Tom Wood, CEO at RAW, welcomed this news and said that he was very happy to see Raging Super2Ways become the milestone game for the operator. “We thank Videoslots for its continuing partnership and hope their players enjoy the game as much as we had fun building it,” Wood said.</p>
<p>The Sky Is the Limit with Videoslots</p>
<p>Videoslots deputy CEO Ulle Skottling was similarly excited about the partnership and said that this achievement was something that the company did not even dream of when the operator was established in 2011. However, it has all worked out fine and the company is now on track to score even bigger wins, Skottling reaffirmed.</p>
<p>Videoslots is also stretching its legs as the company is keen to expand in North America with Ontario, Canada being among its first gateways to the vibrant iGaming region and its markets. The latest success for the company comes several months after the operator faced accusations levied by the Dutch Gaming Authority and said it would contest what it saw as an illegal €9.9 million ($10.5 million) fine.</p>
