<p>British gaming company Metropolitan Gaming has opted to divest its property in South Africa to focus on opportunities in other markets. The operator hopes to streamline its business and put more support behind its operations in its core markets.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Gaming Sells South African Casino</p>
<p>The new chapter in Metropolitan Gaming’s business began with the sale of the company’s interest in Emerald Resort and Casino, a South African gaming venue at Vanderbijlpark. The interest was purchased by the premier local casino brand Tsogo Sun and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>By giving up on South Africa, Metropolitan Gaming will be able to instead focus on other markets, such as the United Kingdom and Egypt where the company has been consolidating its power. A year ago, Metropolitan Gaming purchased a total of 11 venues from the global gambling juggernaut Caesars Entertainment. This year, the company reinforced its operations in the key UK market by also acquiring Park Lane Club in central London in a deal that was praised by Metropolitan Gaming’s CEO.</p>
<p>Currently, the operator owns eight casinos in the United Kingdom and three casinos in Egypt. The company actively working on the renovation and rebranding of the Park Lane Club as it seeks to capitalize on the fast-growing UK market.</p>
<p>The Company Wants to Focus on Its Core Markets</p>
<p>Metropolitan Gaming’s chief executive officer, Michael Silberling, commented on the sale of Emerald Resort and Casino. He noted that the company has realized the need to streamline its business and focus its strategy on its most profitable venues. To that end, the addition of Park Lane Club to the company’s British portfolio was a great deal that is sure to generate great returns.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Gaming bid farewell to its employees at Emerald Resort and Casino and thanked them for their hard work, professionalism and loyalty. Silberling praised the resilience that the workers demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic and said that his company would continue to follow their progress and successes over the years to come.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Gaming is one of the leading casino operators in the United Kingdom. The company operates Empire Casino, The Sportsman, Park Lane Club, Metropolitan Mayfair, Alea Glasgow, Manchester 235, Alea Nottingham and Rendezvous Brighton. In addition, it operates three casinos in Egypt, namely London Club Cairo, Kings and Queens and Ramses Casino.</p>
