<p>After spending five years with the Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association, Paul Foster confirmed he steps down from his role</p>
<p>The trade association representing licensed gambling operators in Gibraltar, the Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association (GBGA), has announced changes to its senior-level team. The Association’s chairman, Nigel Birrell, pointed out that the Association has been going through a transition period. Moreover, the chairman revealed that GBGA’s CEO, Paul Foster, has taken the decision to resign from his role.</p>
<p>Birrell explained that the decision comes at a time when Foster plans to pursue other business ventures. Besides Foster’s resignation, the chairman confirmed that Merel Swarts is also resigning from her role with the Association. Both Foster and Swarts played important roles in the administration and operation of the GBGA, confirmed Birrell.</p>
<p>The chairman acknowledged that Foster was a part of the Association for five years. During his tenure, the GBGA grew and was able to overcome different challenges. Speaking about Swarts and Foster, Birrell thanked them for their dedication, hard work and the important role they played over the last few years.</p>
<p>“We would like to say thank you to Paul for all his hard work over the past five years and the best of luck with his future endeavors. Merel Swarts will also be leaving the GBGA as she continues to provide her support to Paul. Merel has played a pivotal role in all the operations and administration work that the GBGA has carried out over the past few years and we would like to thank Merel and wish her well.“ Nigel Birrell, chairman of the GBGA</p>
<p>GBGA Creates New Secretary General Role</p>
<p>The role of CEO will be replaced with the newly created role of secretary general, explained Birrell. Nicholas Macias, who previously held the role of GBGA’s chief operations officer, will now return to the Association and take the newly created secretary general role. In his new position, Macias will oversee strategic processes as he brings extensive experience within the gambling vertical in Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Throughout his professional experience, he held different senior-level roles related to compliance. The GBGA’s chairman welcomed Macias to the company’s team of experts. He added: “We wish Nicky the very best of luck in this new position and look forward to working with him over the coming years.”</p>
<p>In his new role, Macias will collaborate with the Association’s dream team, Angela Almeida and Bua Malamalatabua. The duo played an important role with GBGA’s website and social media channels and will continue to leverage their expertise while at the same time collaborating with the new secretary general.</p>
