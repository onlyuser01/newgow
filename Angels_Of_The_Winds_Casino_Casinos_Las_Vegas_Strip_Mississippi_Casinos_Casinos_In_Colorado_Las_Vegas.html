<p>Yggdrasil and ReelPlay Launch Bucks and Doe 10K WAYS with Up to 10K Ways to Win</p>
<p>Yggdrasil, the leading publisher of iGaming content that “breaths innovation” and pushes boundaries, has once again joined forces with the Sydney-based creator of high-quality digital gaming content best known for the original Infinity Reels, ReelPlay.</p>
<p>The two released Bucks and Does 10K WAYS, a fresh slot with a hunting theme at the center that packs plenty of bonus respins and a buy feature.</p>
<p>In April, the two partners released Cluster Pays Slot Hyper Respins, following the launch of Big Bucks Buffalo GigaBlox in March, to name just a couple of other successful collaborations between Yggdrasil and ReelPlay.</p>
<p>The new game with a hunting theme at the center packs plenty of bonus respins and a buy feature, guaranteeing a wild and epic experience.</p>

<p>The Slot, “Another Fantastic Collaboration” Through the GATI Program</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s chief gaming officer, Mark McGinley, spoke about ReelPlay’s 10K WAYS mechanic, describing it as “exemplary” and explaining how it added a new angle to their YG Masters portfolio.</p>
<p>McGinley further spoke about the latest release as “another fantastic collaboration” via GATI, their dedicated technology that allows partners to use preconfigured, regulation-ready, and fully standardized development toolkits to generate content that is rapidly distributed.</p>
<p>ReelPlay’s chief executive officer, David Johnson, praised their 10K WAYS series’ ability to get “stronger with every release” while mentioning the Bonus Respins’ huge win potential thanks to the available modifiers.</p>
<p>Finally, Johnson explained that, combined with the one-of-a-kind theme, the game is prone to turn into another precious addition to their partners’ portfolios.</p>
<p>Get Ready for a Chain of Explosions</p>
<p>The action takes place in a woodman’s cabin and wild bears are seen roaming around. The images are nicely rendered while the sounds create an even more authentic hunting atmosphere.</p>
<p>The game packs as many as 10,000 ways to win. Each of them brings players a chain of explosions consisting of extra wins including the Bonus Respins feature that features impressive prizes.</p>
<p>To trigger the Bonus Respins feature, players must land at least three Scatter symbols where animals are turned into Prize symbols. Deer, Elk, and Moose can reveal winnings of 1x to 100x, 150x, and 200x while hitting the juicy Trophy Bonus prizes will generate the ultimate reward of 2,000x.</p>
<p>For even more rewarding wins, players need to keep a close eye on the special Bear, Hunter, and Ammunition symbols.</p>
<p>In some jurisdictions, players are allowed to quickly progress to the Bonus with the help of one of four available bonus buy options. Last week, Yggdrasil released Mayan Waterfalls via Thunderbolt Gaming, following the June launch of Starfire Fortunes TopHit, debuting its 10th game engagement mechanic, TopHit.</p>
