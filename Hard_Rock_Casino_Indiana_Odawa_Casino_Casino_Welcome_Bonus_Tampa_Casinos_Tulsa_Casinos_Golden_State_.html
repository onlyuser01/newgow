<p>Golden State Warriors vs. Sacramento Kings is the final NBA Playoff game on Saturday, April 15. It’s taking place at Sacramento’s Golden 1 Center, where the Kings will try to get one over their state rivals</p>
<p>If we told you a year ago that one of these teams would be the highest-scoring team of the 2022-23 regular season, your mind would’ve gone to the Warriors. But it’s the Kings who scored more points than anyone else in the regular season. Are they going to continue this trend in the playoffs, and will it help them beat the Warriors on Saturday? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Moneyline Odds Golden State Warriors -110 Sacramento Kings -110</p>

<p>Golden State’s Form is (Finally) Great</p>
<p>The reigning NBA champs did struggle in the regular season, especially around the New Year when their best player Steph Curry was struggling with a shoulder injury. Since then, he also had some problems with his hip, leg, and knee, which made him sit out many games in January and February.</p>
<p>But since March, he’s been 100% fit, and more importantly, in the mood for scoring points. Curry has scored 20+ points in all but one game since March 5. One of those games was against the Kings, which the Warriors won 119-97 on April 7. Curry scored 25 points that evening and wasn’t the top scorer of the game. Instead, it was his colleague, Klay Thompson.</p>
<p>He too has been brilliant lately, especially when it comes to three-pointers. It’s very likely we’ll see him and Carry score a decent number of three-point field goals on Saturday. But will it be enough to outscore the highest-scoring team in the NBA?</p>
<p>The Kings are Ready for Big Outing</p>
<p>The Kings wrapped up their 2022-23 regular season campaign with a 1-4 record in April. It sure sounds bad, but there’s a caveat. They decided to take it easy in the season finish as they had booked their place in the postseason weeks earlier.</p>
<p>That said, their poor recent run doesn’t mean they’re out of shape. On the contrary, they’re likely going to be in great shape on Saturday as their best players have spent the last couple of weeks preparing for this game. De’Aaron Fox, Domantas Sabonis, Kevin Huerter, and others are all set to have a great time in the first game of the NBA Playoff series with the Warriors.</p>
<p>Warriors vs. Kings Prediction</p>
<p>Anything can happen in this game, but one thing is certain – we’re going to see a lot of points on both ends. But which team will score more? It’s really 50-50, but we’ll go with the hosts this time.</p>
<p>Pick: Sacramento Kings to win; over to hit</p>
