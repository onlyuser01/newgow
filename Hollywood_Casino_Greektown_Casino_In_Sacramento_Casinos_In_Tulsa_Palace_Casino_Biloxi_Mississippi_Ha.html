    <h1>Hollywood Casino Greektown Casino In Sacramento Casinos In Tulsa Palace Casino Biloxi Mississippi Ha</h1>

<p>The company has stolen another stride on the competition after it managed to successfully expand the reach of its own content products</p>
<p>Reevo will now have the opportunity to install its original and in-house games with Spinoro’s dedicated Game Hub solution, which has been gaining traction over the past months. Featuring 180 games as of right now, Spinoro’s Game Hub will get a content boost from titles such as Reel Fortune and Diamond Luck.</p>
<p>Reevo and Spinoro Happy to Amplify the Reach of Their Products</p>
<p>Some of Reevo’s latest releases, including Mayan Magic Gold and Treasures God, along with Le Bo$$u: Richesse Royale and Spinnerix &amp; Winnerix: The Magic Potion are all coming to the platform, allowing Reevo to also scale its own content footprint.</p>
<p>The partnership goes both ways, though, as the companies confirmed in the official press release that Spinoro will also have access to Reevo’s powerful aggregation platform, which includes hand-picked games by third-party suppliers, which are then integrated through a single API.</p>
<p>This year has been particularly good for Reevo’s aggregation platform as the company has been rapidly scaling its product reach and offer, adding numerous household supplier names over the past weeks and months, among which are partnerships with Evolution and Booming Games.</p>
<p>Spinoro is also enjoying a strong uptake. The aggregation platform is provided by Anakatech and it’s already making its presence felt in global markets. Both Reevo and Spinoro have ambitious roadmaps for this year that they intend to deliver on.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity Reevo head of sales Petra Maria Poola hailed the chance to see a new prominent brand become the company’s partner once again. Poola appreciated the fact that Reevo will also get a content step-up by leveraging Spinoro to raise awareness for the unique in-house slots.</p>
<p>Spinoro COO Jeff Letlat was similarly happy to be joining Reevo and said that the addition of Reevo games will significantly expand the company’s product offering and improve the interaction between clients and products. “This partnership is a step forward in our mission to provide players with the most engaging and immersive gaming experience possible,” Letlat explained.</p>
