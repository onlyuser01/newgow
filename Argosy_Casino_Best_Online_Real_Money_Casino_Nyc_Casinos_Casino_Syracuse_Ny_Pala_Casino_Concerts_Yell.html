    <h1>Argosy Casino Best Online Real Money Casino Nyc Casinos Casino Syracuse Ny Pala Casino Concerts Yell</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>We have checked this players complaint and transaction history and we can see that our cashier system has been declining this players withdrawal request because: 1) not only does he have 19 multiple accounts (yes, 19!) registered on our site; but 2) many of these accounts are also registered under multiple false identities; and 3) the bank accounts submitted for the withdrawal requests are again not corresponding to the names registered on the account.</p>
<p>Registering multiple accounts alone is a serious violation of our terms and conditions and is a banned practice on our site. But this player has taken things much further - with 19 registered - and with false identities and non-matching bank details to the names registered on the account. All of these types of behaviour are obviously serious breaches and are indicative of professional/ organised cheating behaviour.</p>
<p>Regarding this players apparent 530,000 INR withdrawal request, the request was declined by our cashier system pending further investigation from our compliance team, BUT as a matter of curtesy the account and the money was not suspended or withheld. In other words the players balance still had 530,000 INR. However, the player decided to keep on playing and lost this sum during the course of play. In other words, there is no 530,000 INR pending anymore, because he lost this playing. Now that this amount his lost, the player is trying to create a different version of events.</p>
<p>It is entirely within the right of our cashier team and compliance team to decline withdrawal requests by players that have seriously violated our rules (as in this case), pending further investigation and determination. We consider our actions reasonable; we simply declined the withdrawal request pending further investigation by our compliance team. We did not deduct his winnings or confiscate the players balance (even though we have a right too). The player then lost this money with his own actions playing.</p>
<p>As always, we are happy to provide screenshot evidence to Casino Guru either in this web forum or in a private email, just let us know which is preferred....</p>
<p>You guys have our contact email address.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
