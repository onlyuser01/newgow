<p>Hi,</p>
<p>so I would like to start by saying that, according to us, Bizzo Casino does not accept Czech players and does not support VPN:</p>
<p>The full review is here . So I wouldn't deposit there, because I would risk not passing the account verification.</p>
<p>So do I understand correctly that registration from the Czech Republic is possible? ðŸ¤” If so, I would still ask the chat operator if everything is OK, or solve the verification right away - just to be sure.</p>
<p>Since each verification, deposit and withdrawal can be different, I cannot say exactly where everything is without problems. However, the solution is to play in an anonymous casino using crypto currencies, a list of such casinos is right here .</p>
<p>Regarding live games, we have a special filter for that, so you just need to set them as needed:</p>
<p>Of course, you should only play in casinos with a Czech license - that's qualified advice ðŸ˜€. But honestly, it's more about the player's safety, there's no bureau or authority to check if the players are following it . But if a problem arises, you can only rely on the licensing authority of a foreign country - many players would confirm that such a Curacao license means zero help, or a paid lawyer.</p>
<p>So, if you want to play in a casino without a Czech license, it will be good to choose one of the bigger brands, with a good rating and license. Take a look at this list , maybe you'll like something ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Let me know how it went. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž</p>
