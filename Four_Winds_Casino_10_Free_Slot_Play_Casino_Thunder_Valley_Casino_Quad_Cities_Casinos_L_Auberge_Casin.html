<p>The authority selected the two appointees after an extensive and competitive recruitment process led by its Nominations Committee</p>
<p>The British Horseracing Authority (BHA), a body governing racing in the United Kingdom, has expanded its team with two new additions. As announced by the regulator, Kyrsten Halley and Tara Warren will join its board as independent non-executive directors (NEDs).</p>
<p>Halley joined the company on May 1 and will serve an initial three-year term. Halley will replace Joe Saumarez Smith who was recently promoted to chairman of the authority.</p>
<p>As someone with more than 10 years of experience in senior leadership positions, Halley has all the skills needed to serve the company. Her specialty is brand strategy, digital marketing and delivering transformational change, the BHA announced.</p>
<p>In addition, Halley is a passionate fan of racing who loves spending time with her retired thoroughbred horse. Éclair Mag.</p>
<p>Tara Warren, on the other hand, will begin her three-year term on December 1. She will replace the outgoing independent NED Laura Whyte, who is leaving the authority after serving her maximum term.</p>
<p>Warren is experienced with sports-related leadership positions and is currently the executive director and board member of West Ham United FC. In addition to that, she directs the club’s equality, diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>
<p>Just like Halley, Warren is no stranger to horseracing and is a regular racegoer.</p>
<p>The New NEDs Are Looking Forward to Contributing to British Racing</p>
<p>The two women commented on their new position, sharing their delight to join the BHA board. Halley noted that now is a “critical time” for British racing and noted that it is important to shape racing’s future. She said that she is looking forward to contributing to this objective and helping the BHA harness tech to appeal to young bettors.</p>
<p>Warren, meanwhile, called the opportunity to work with the board a “huge privilege”. She said that she is excited to support the development and delivery of racing’s long-term plan, teasing that a key element will be revenue growth.</p>
<p>Joe Saumarez Smith, BHA’s chair, welcomed the two new hires to the board. He praised their passion for racing, as well as their robust experiences in commerce, marketing, customer engagement and transformational change.</p>
<p>Saumarez used the opportunity to thank Laura Whyte for her exceptional service and said that British racing might not have been the same without her.</p>
<p>The BHA noted that the new appointments followed an “extensive and competitive” recruitment campaign that was led by the Nominations Committee. The committee, which is comprised of representatives from the British racing scene, made the two recommendations.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2023, the BHA handed down a 15-year career-ending ban to Danny Brock, a promising jockey who fixed games.</p>
