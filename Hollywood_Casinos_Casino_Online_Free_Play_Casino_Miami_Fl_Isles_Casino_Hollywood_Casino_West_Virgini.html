<p>The membership of the BCLC with ULIS is expected to help boost the integrity of sports</p>
<p>The Canadian Crown corporation offering different gambling options and managing commercial gambling on behalf of the Province of British Columbia, the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC), became the latest organization to join the United Lotteries for Integrity in Sports (ULIS).</p>
<p>ULIS is an organization that has a strategic goal to help lotteries protect the integrity of sports competitions. Initially, the organization was known as Global Lottery Monitoring System (GLMS), but it has undergone a rebranding back in October when it was renamed to ULIS.</p>
<p>As the latest ULIS member, the BCLC will contribute to its goal to safeguard the integrity of sports. Moreover, the corporation will play a key role in the fight against match-fixing and corruption by collaborating with stakeholders in the industry, regulators, law enforcement and other organizations within the sector.</p>
<p>“British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) has joined United Lotteries for Integrity in Sports (ULIS) following the approval of the ULIS Executive Committee on March 17, 2023,“ reads a statement released by ULIS</p>
<p>BCLC Is the 3rd Canadian Lottery to Join ULIS</p>
<p>Joining ULIS, BCLC becomes the third Canadian lottery to support the organization. Along with BCLC, other lotteries from the country that have joined ULIS include Ontario Lottery and Gaming (OLG), as well as Loto Quebec.</p>
<p>BCLC’s membership with ULIS comes as no surprise, considering its extensive experience within the gambling vertical. In fact, since the corporation’s launch back in 1985, it has generated more than CA$28 billion ($20.6 billion) for the Province of British Columbia. Those funds helped support different public initiatives, health care, as well as education programs.</p>
<p>“ULIS is delighted to welcome BCLC as a member. BCLC’s commitment to ESG, responsible gambling and community outreach aligns with our values, and we look forward to working with BCLC to promote a culture of integrity in sports,“ Ludovico Calvi, president of ULIS</p>
<p>Ludovico Calvi, ULIS’ president, said that the organization is excited to see BCLC join its cause. He pointed out that BCLC and ULIS share similar values when it comes to ESG, as well as responsible gambling. Finally, Calvi said that ULIS is looking forward to the success the collaboration will bring and help boost the integrity of sports.</p>
