<p>Spotlight Sports Group, a leader in the provision of technology, content, and media options for partners, has upgraded its Superfeed content engine</p>
<p>This will result in the delivery of more content in new and existing markets and across more sports events and leagues.</p>
<p>Spotlight Sports Group Doubles Down on Insights</p>
<p>Spotlight has essentially doubled the volume of betting prompts received for each game, citing a growing demand from consumers keen to experience even more worthwhile and in-depth market options and content.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the company’s Superfeed engine is delivering insights in 136 betting markets. Spotlight has upgraded the engine to meet an influx of new bettors who are keen to leverage their knowledge of sports and place a wager that results in a positive experience for them.</p>
<p>The group is also looking into player markets which are becoming increasingly popular and which bring new opportunities for everyone to experience even more sports in a manner that feels intimate, entertaining, and rewarding.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by Spotlight Sports Group B2B sales director Rob Black who commented on the latest upgrade:</p>
<p>With these new advances, we are able to supply an even greater volume of insights for pre- and in-play bettors. Spotlight Sports Group B2B sales director Rob Black</p>
<p>Presently, Superfeed runs through more than 80,000 sporting events every year and offers its insights into 70 languages. It covers in-play content from 90 football leagues, horse racing, and greyhounds, allowing the company to leverage these powerful data feeds through simple widgets or API.</p>
<p>Better Retention and Engagement for Partner Customers</p>
<p>A recent study indicated that Superfeed’s in-play prompts have been particularly successful, as the display of insights has led to a 20% increase in the bets placed. The solution was similarly positive when factoring in the level of engagement, which Superfeed claims is four-and-a-half times greater.</p>
<p>Black confirmed that Spotlight has led to greater engagement and retention rates. He hailed the opportunity Spotlight now had to support its customers further and break insights that improve the experience for everyone.</p>
