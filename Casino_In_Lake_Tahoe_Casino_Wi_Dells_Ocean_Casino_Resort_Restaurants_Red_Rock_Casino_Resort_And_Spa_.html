<p>Urban Chaos Meets the Buzz of the Big City</p>
<p>On December 28, get ready to enter the mesmerizing cyberpunk city that uses chips and diamonds as commodities for great success. Immerse yourself in the Zap!Pots to cancel out the disturbing noise from the city’s ongoing hustle and bustle and prepare to land Wilds to go to the next level.</p>
<p>As you continue to spin your way through Megacity’s skyline of Megacity, you will notice a series of symbols on the grid that perfectly reflect the overall atmosphere. The list includes cherries, lemons, plums, sparkling diamonds, dice, and Zap! Symbols.</p>
<p>The latter will trigger the bonus round with the potential of scoring mega wins with a jackpot of up to 2,000x awarded to players who collect enough Zap! icons while engaged in the base game or by unlocking new levels in the Free Games.</p>
<p>Free Games and Bonus Buy</p>
<p>Players must land at least three scatters to activate the Free Games and receive eight unlockable levels with additional opportunities to win more.</p>
<p>The Free Games are initiated with a 5×3 reel and 50 paylines. While engaged in the Free Games rounds, each new level except for the last one will proceed to add a new row as well as 10 extra paylines.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the Zap! symbols to keep the fun going. If you wish to feel the pulse of the city on the spot, you can jump straight into the deep end and purchase the available Buy Feature.</p>
<p>This way, you will enter the Free Games rounds without having to waste precious time waiting for the feature to trigger naturally during the base game.</p>
<p>The release of the slot with an “electric soundtrack and atmospheric nightscape” follows the studio’s BF HUG game aggregator launch. In August, the company expanded its content reach with the help of a new deal with SOFTSWISS.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Megacity release, the company’s product owner, Piotr Saluda, used it as an example that once again proves their commitment to constantly working on offering more engaging and creative slots.</p>
<p>Saluda further added the multiple jackpot levels make the new game “one of our most thrilling yet.”</p>
<p>In July, BF Games announced it would join forces with SkillOnNet as part of a new content partnership.</p>
