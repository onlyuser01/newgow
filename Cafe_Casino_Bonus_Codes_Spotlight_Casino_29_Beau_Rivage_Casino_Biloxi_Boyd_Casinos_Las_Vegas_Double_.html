<p>Stakelogic has chosen Fontbet to release its popular classic and video slots to its players in Greece</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Stakelogic has been on an ongoing journey to grow and take the industry by storm. Proving it doesn’t like to waste any time, the studio that puts innovation at the forefront of all its games has been bagging one big operator after another in a series of important partnerships.</p>
<p>One of its latest accomplishments is a content distribution deal inked with the Belgium-based casino operator PepperMill. Now, the company that has chosen “Think Bigger” as its slogan has announced a similar agreement directed at the Greek market.</p>
<p>Fontbet, the sports betting company founded in 1994, has agreed to start delivering Stakelogic’s iconic classic and video slot titles to its Greek players.</p>
<p>What Can Greek Players Expect?</p>
<p>Just like the rest of the content integration deals signed by the studio, the fresh agreement for the Greek gaming market will bring a lot of versatility and premium quality to Fonbet’s existing game library.</p>
<p>As explained by Fontbet’s Plumo Ltd Athens branch’s deputy general director Yiannis Gangas, their players will “enjoy some of the most popular slots in the market” thanks to the new deal with Stakelogic.</p>
<p>Greek players will be introduced to Stakelogic’s old-school, classic games which the studio is probably best known. The games are packed with elements that carry players back in time, such as the standard cherries, melons, 7x, grapes, bells, and bars.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular classic slot games Greek players will get access to via Fontbet’s platform are Runner 8 Runner, Super Bonus Wild Mega Runner, Bonus Runner, and Super 6 Timer.</p>
<p>All of these games are also cleverly mixed with fast-paced, lucrative game mechanics and features like Free Spins, Multipliers, and Wilds that ramp up the potential wins.</p>
<p>Fontbet will also offer Stakelogic’s modern-day, engaging video slots with mesmerizing graphics, excellent audio, and adrenaline-pumping features. Among the games, we can mention Wild Buzz, Cash Express, El Cowboy Megaways, Star Staxx, or Diamond Staxx Multipays.</p>
<p>Super Stake and Spin to Win, Available via Fontbet</p>
<p>Since the studio is determined to offer state-of-the-art games that “are changing how players play”, it is constantly busy working on creating special features that can revolutionize the industry.</p>
<p>Among them, we can mention their excellent Spin to Win and Super Stake features which can now be used by Fonbet’s players in Greece.</p>
<p>The Super Stake feature enables players to double their bet and this way boost their chances of triggering a bonus and landing a highly lucrative win combination.</p>
<p>The Spin to Win feature mixes Random Number Generator gameplay with a progressive jackpot Game Show that has its own live host. The feature enables players to spin a live wheel packed with prizes and potentially scoop up a massive win.</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s senior sales manager Danila Dzehs spoke about the new agreement with Fonbet, expressing excitement about the operator’s players being able to “activate Super Stake and enjoy their first Spin to Win round.”</p>
