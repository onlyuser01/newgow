<p>The dates for the 2020 World Series of Poker are set from May 26th until July 15th, and it will take place at the Rio All-Suites.</p>
<p>Big Plans for WSOP 2020</p>
<p>The organizers of the WSOP are getting the stage set for next year’s event, and they have just announced the dates for the tournament. The 2020 World Series of Poker will take place from May 26th to July 15th at the Rio All-Suites in Las Vegas and, as always, it is anticipated to be a huge event that will draw an international crowd.</p>
<p>According to WSOP organizers, the Main Event will be held from July 1st to July 14th. The first three flights will take place over the first two days of the Main Event, but there will be just two Day 2s. All of the players who make it through Days 1A and 1B will play again on July 4th on Day 2AB. Players that survive Day 1C will go on to Day 2C on July 5th.</p>
<p>Then, both fields will come together on July 6th – at which point the competition will surely heat up. Millions will be at stake, with everyone at the final table sure to receive at least $1 million, so you’re going to see lots of competitive excitement once all of the players come together. Then, the final table is expected to begin on July 10th.</p>
<p>2019’s World Series of Poker</p>
<p>The WSOP is always a thrilling event in the poker world, and last year’s was a doozy. It was the 50th anniversary of the World Series of Poker, and the organizers really outdid themselves, so we can’t wait to see what’s in store for this year.</p>
<p>Last year, there were 90 bracelet events at the World Series of Poker. Over 150,000 players descended upon Las Vegas to compete and vie for the chance to win amazing prizes while earning themselves bragging rights in the poker community.</p>
<p>The Main Event saw over 8500 entrants and generated an $80 million prize pool. It was the second largest turnout for a WSOP Main Event in the history of the tournament, and its winner was Hossein Ensan. He landed himself a huge $10 million payday, after beating out Dario Sammartino who earned a tidy sum of $8 million for himself.</p>
<p>So, on the basis of how successful the 2019 WSOP was, we’re sure that 2020 will have even bigger guarantees and more events in store. We’ll be sure to keep you posted when more news is released.</p>
