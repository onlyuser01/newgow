<p>Information about Bancontact casinos</p>
<p>Bancontact Payconiq is a Belgian digital payment provider that is the result of a merger between two companies in 2018. It allows users to make quick payments online or with their mobile and, as their name suggests, they presently focus on contactless transactions.</p>
<p>If you use this payment method, then you'll be able to make Bancontact deposits and withdrawals in a range of online casinos. This page will help you find the best of those: each site has been reviewed and rated by the Casino Guru team, so read on to find out more about the casino search, as well as Bancontact and its features.</p>

<p>Bancontact: one of Belgium's premier payment methods</p>
<p>While the current company has only been in existence since 2018, Bancontact can trace its origin back to 1979 when it was launched as a payment scheme by a trio of Belgian banks.</p>
<p>In 1989, it merged with rival system Mister Cash to form Banksys, a successful electronic payment method. When Atos Wordline acquired Banksys in 2006, Belgian shareholders were allowed to continue the Bancontact name as a new payment scheme within the country. This provided the launchpad for the company that exists today.</p>
<p>In May 2014, Bancontact launched a new payment app that let users pay for supermarket products by scanning a QR code and entering a PIN. They could also pay for goods online and transfer funds to their friends. The scheme exploded in popularity, to the point that, together with rival firm Payconiq, it was responsible for 15 million transactions in 2017.</p>
<p>The following year, the two dominant players announced their merger to form Bancontact Payconiq. The focus ever since has been on the growing contactless payment market, helped by hygiene-conscious public mentality brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Several banks have signed up to the Bancontact payment scheme, opening up a much wider market to the company. Users can now use the method to pay for public transport tickets, buy products online, order a takeaway or settle their energy bills. The contactless feature was pushed further with the launch of 'wearables': smart rings, bracelets, watches and key rings that facilitate digital payments through the user holding them next to a payment terminal.</p>
<p>Today, Bancontact continues to dominate the Belgian e-payments market: it's available on Apple Store and Google Play and is available to use with thousands of stores and websites across Europe.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of Bancontact</p>
<p>When we look at the pros and cons of a payment method, we want to see that it's quick, easy-to-use, and reliable.</p>
<p>Bancontact is all three of these: first, it offers instant payments, so if you're depositing into an online casino then you should see the funds in your playing account immediately.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's super simple to make a transaction. Once you have the Bancontact app, it's just a case of linking it to your bank account and answering a few security questions. From then on, you should be able to make a payment in just a few taps of your keyboard or screen.</p>
<p>Bancontact is also secure. Users use a digipass or card reader for online transactions so it's very difficult to use a stolen card. Contactless payments over €50 are also PIN protected.</p>
<p>There are a couple of downsides to take note of, however. Certain Bancontact transactions may incur a fee – the website isn't very clear in specifying how much this is, but it's normally a low amount for methods like this. Be sure to check the terms and conditions before you open an account if you're not comfortable with this.</p>
<p>Note: Bancontact is also unavailable to users in most countries outside of Belgium. Generally speaking, only Belgian residents can get a card, so if you're not based there, you'll probably have to find an alternative payment method.</p>
<p>How to pay by Bancontact in an online casino</p>
<p>As mentioned, paying with Bancontact is quite easy, including making an online casino deposit.</p>
<p>The first step is to make sure you have your Bancontact login on hand, as well as a fully opened casino account. You can then take the following steps:</p>
<p>Log into your casino and go to the cashier. Under its deposit methods, you should see the Bancontact logo. Click on that. Enter your card info and the amount you'd like to deposit. Double-check all the details and click 'confirm'.</p>
<p>The funds will be debited from your bank account and should appear in your casino balance immediately. If it takes longer than a few hours, then check with the casino and/or your bank to make sure the transaction has gone through successfully.</p>
<p>Bancontact casino withdrawals aren't as readily available, but still possible. For these, you'll have to check with the casino in question as to whether they allow them. If they do, then you just follow the same process as above, except you go to the withdrawals section instead. These may also be more expensive and take longer than deposits.</p>

<p>Bancontact casino bonuses</p>
<p>Bonuses can be a nice way for a player to get to know a new casino, if used correctly. Normally in the form of free spins or extra credit, a casino might award a deposit bonus following a payment into your account, or a no deposit bonus simply for signing up.</p>
