<p>Betway continued to expand its presence in Latin America after an exclusive partnership with Stock Car Pro Series Brazil named the sports betting and gaming brand an Official Sponsor of the series.</p>
<p>First Motorsports Sports Deal</p>
<p>The deal signed between Super Group-owned Betway and Brazil’s touring car auto racing series Stock Car Pro Series Brazil marked the first motorsports sponsorship for the global online gambling brand that continues to expand its footprint in the world of sports while enlarging its geographical presence.</p>
<p>The deal with the auto racing series also represents Betway’s first sports deal in Brazil, Betway CEO Anthony Werkman outlined in his comments.</p>
<p>“The Stock Car Pro Series is one of the most supported and viewed sports in Brazil with it being broadcast on their free-to-air television channel Band. We’re excited by this partnership that will no doubt help grow our brand awareness in South America.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>The new agreement is set to boost Betway’s brand awareness throughout the year, providing television exposure with each race of the series that will be broadcast on free-to-air channel Band and SportTV.</p>
<p>Betway branding across the racetracks will be visible for both fans who attend the races live and those who choose to watch the action on television. Stock Car Pro Series Brazil is letting live audiences for the first time since 2019.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the announcement, Arthur Silva, head of marketing for Betway in Brazil, expressed his delight to become a sponsor of “one of the biggest categories of Brazilian motor racing,” as well as strong belief the sport that is already loved by many fans “still has great growth potential” in the country.</p>
<p>Exclusive Content across Social Media</p>
<p>Betway and Stock Car Pro Series will collaborate under the agreement to produce and deliver exclusive content across social media channels on each of the race days of the competition that commenced on February 11 at the Autodromo Interlagos and will end in the weekend of November 18-20 at the Autodromo International Nelson Piquet. A total of 24 races will be divided into 12 stages.</p>
<p>“We are very proud to have Betway as Stock Car Pro Series Sponsor. One of the world leaders in this segment, which has been constantly investing in major sports competitions and especially, that supports and defends the responsible gambling. We will be together with Betway, believing in the growth of this market in Brazil.” Fernando Julianelli, CEO, Stock Car Pro Series Brazil</p>
<p>The races of the series will feature some of the biggest names from the world of motorsports globally, including Stock Car Pro Series regulars Caca Bueno, Daniel Serra, Ricardo Mauricio, Thiago Camilo, and Gabriel Casagrande, while former F1 drivers Rubens Barrichello, Felipe Massa, Ricardo Zonta, and Nelson Piquet Jnr. will further intensify the competition.</p>
<p>The announcement of the sponsorship came just days after Betway announced its launch in Buenos Aires, where the brand’s online casino went operational in both the City and Province of the capital of Argentina.</p>
