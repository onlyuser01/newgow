<p>Leading igaming supplier and provider of content, Play’n GO, has doubled down on its US expansion by signing up a new important deal with BetMGM. BetMGM is an operator that offers gaming and betting products across both sports betting and online casino. The two companies have teamed up to expand their operations in New Jersey.</p>
<p>As a result, Garden State players who are registered at BetMGM can now enjoy an outstanding selection of games brought by the esteemed supplier. Those include Cash Pump, Ankh of Anubis, Cat Wilde, Lost Chapter, and so many spot-on and worthwhile titles out there. Play’n GO has also signed a deal that will enable the pair to collaborate together across other pivotal markets for both companies.</p>
<p>The pair is preparing to go live in Michigan, according to the official press release shared on the developer’s website. Commenting on this opportunity, Play’n GO CCO Magnus Olsson expressed his excitement to be part of this journey and the company’s further push into the regulated US market.</p>
<p>Moving forward, BetMGM will be able to introduce players to one of the most popular online slots in the world, Book of Dead, Olsson noted. "This is a hugely exciting time for Play’n GO in North America. We recently exhibited at G2E for the first time and our content is already performing strongly in New Jersey and Ontario," he continued.</p>
<p>However, the company is not going to stop there either. Olsson did confirm that Play’n GO remains equally hungry and focused on growing and strengthening its footprint in Europe and Latin America, which are equally important to it. Play’n GO also has boots-on-the-ground experience in New Jersey as well, having already launched in the state with PokerStars.</p>
<p>Play’n GO is also represented in Michigan, where the next part of the BetMGM partnership is supposed to pivot to, and not least, there is also the company’s expansion in Ontario from earlier this year in March, as Play’n GO is committed to growth in the province as well as elsewhere in the region.</p>
<p>Overall, Play’n Go is pulling ahead in the North American region partly because of realization that the online casino segment is about to explode in places like the United States and partly realizing that in order to stay competitive, it will need to keep making its products available in the highly lucrative iGaming market as it is being forged.</p>
