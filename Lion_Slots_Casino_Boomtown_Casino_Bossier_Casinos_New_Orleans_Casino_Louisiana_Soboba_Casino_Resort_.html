    <h1>Lion Slots Casino Boomtown Casino Bossier Casinos New Orleans Casino Louisiana Soboba Casino Resort</h1>

<p>The company is looking to rapidly expand in the vertical and deliver its expertise and technical solutions to new partners all over the world. As a result, the national lottery will benefit from an end-to-end suite of various sports betting software solutions and services.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix to Boost the Company Behind Hungarian National Lottery</p>
<p>These new products will be incorporated into the TippmixPro online brand and extend beyond the lottery portfolio. EveryMatrix is confident that its expertise and ready solutions are enough to transform the current operations and potential of the national lottery and TippmixPro.</p>
<p>Part of this transformation will involve the incorporation of the OddsMatrix Sportsbook, which will include data feeds for maximum productivity, scalability, and not least, stability.</p>
<p>In addition, the companies have agreed to incorporate EveryMatrix player account management, bonusing, acquisition, retention, reactivation, affiliate management, payment systems, and more.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix has overcome a contested field of rival bidders with 25 companies applying for the tender which lasted 15 months before a winner was selected. This, though, makes an important addition to the EveryMatrix portfolio as the company already works with Veikkaus in Finland, Norsk Tipping in Norway, European Lotteries, and the World Lottery Association.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix is also a partner to the National Lottery in Malta and OPAP in Greece. The Hungarian national lottery currently has 7,700 sales points in the country. Meanwhile, EveryMatrix CCO Stian Hornsletten welcomed the opportunity to see his company power another lottery partner.</p>
<p>Hornsletten noted that EveryMatrix has long been planning to expand its presence in the lottery segment and make its presence felt. The company’s first forays in this area date back to 2016 and are bound to continue in the future. He explained:</p>
<p>Winning SZRT ahead of many of our competitors yet again underlines the quality of our technology solutions, services, and expertise across multiple elements, from sportsbook and player account management to bonusing, payments and affiliate management.</p>
<p>Better Experiences for Consumers and New Forays in Sports Betting</p>
<p>He said that the company was delighted to be joining forces with SZRT in order to innovate the customer journey and deliver stronger bottom-line results for all parties involved, along with safe and responsible products for players.</p>
<p>Szerencsejáték Privately Held Company Limited sports betting director Zoltán Horváth was equally pleased with the news and welcomed EveryMatrix as a seminal partner in the journey towards better consumer experiences. Horváth confirmed that his company is looking to significantly scale its operational reach in the sports betting segment.</p>
