<p>The celebrated industry gathering that reunites the best affiliates, iGaming Club, is returning for a new London edition in 2024. Celebrating this milestone, AffPapa has revealed the date and some additional information about one of the most anticipated and looked forward to industry get-togethers.</p>
<p>iGaming Club London 2024 will take place on February 6 and be held with more details to be fleshed out. Meanwhile, interested parties may already buy their tickets, whether that is a Single, Duo, or VIP Ticket, each with their own perks.</p>
<p>The iGaming Club is a newly launched series of gatherings that focuses on the affiliate vertical and brings together stakeholders and representatives from the sector to help them forge new relationships and strengthen business opportunities.</p>
<p>AffPapa has already held events in London, Malta, Amsterdam, and Barcelona, and collaborated with some of the biggest events and companies to bring the iGaming Club right to the beating heart of the industry.</p>

<p>The announcement was welcomed by AffPapa CEO Levon Nikoghosyan who was equally excited about pinpointing iGaming Club 2024 on the calendar. "For this edition, we’ve designed an exclusive VIP experience for our attendees, featuring dinner and drinks, making networking and forging connections easier for everyone," Nikoghosyan said.</p>
