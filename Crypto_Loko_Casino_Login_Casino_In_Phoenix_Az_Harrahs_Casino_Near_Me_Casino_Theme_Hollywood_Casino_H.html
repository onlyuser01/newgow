<p>Information about Ezugi casinos</p>
<p>Ezugi is a prominent online casino platform that provides live dealer games and software to internet sites and bricks-and-mortar betting entities. The company, as part of the Evolution Gaming Group, runs several studios in various locations across the world and boasts many partnerships with leading operators.</p>
<p>This page displays a list of online casinos with Ezugi games. It will show you how to choose the best Ezugi casino according to your needs, and has information about the story behind the company, the software it uses and how you can find bonuses from Ezugi casinos.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Ezugi - a live-dealer platform with a global outlook</p>
<p>Ezugi came to life in 2012 when a group of experienced gaming industry workers decided to target the live casino market. Their aim was to replicate the casino experience for players in their own homes by bringing them highly realistic live-dealer roulette, poker and blackjack games, as well as a host of lesser-known titles.</p>
<p>Since its formation, Ezugi has expanded from its roots to create a global network of state-of-the-art studios in nine different countries, and has launched its games in many more, including nations as varied as South Africa, Lithuania and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>2017 saw the start of a series of major events for Ezugi, starting with the introduction of their Over-The-Top technology in their live-dealer casino games. This new software brought together players both in land-based casinos and online via HD cameras: a style of play that was one of the first of its kind.</p>
<p>Note: After launching in several more countries in 2018, Ezugi became part of the Evolution Gaming group the following year, which expanded the scale of its operations further. The company launched its brand new Ezugi 3.0 product range and a flagship studio in Bucharest as part of an ambitious expansion plan. 2020 saw them enter South Africa and Sri Lanka as they continued to enter new markets.</p>
<p>Given its prominence in the online gaming industry, it's perhaps surprising that it took until 2020 for Ezugi to obtain the respected Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) license. However, it has successfully passed the certificate's strict requirements, and it joins the Curacao license, as well as other minor licenses, in Ezugi's set of official accreditations. Players should be assured that all Ezugi content is reliable and safe to play on.</p>
<p>Ezugi casino games and software</p>
<p>Ezugi specialize in providing live-dealer casino software and a quick look on their website will reveal a selection of table games to play – ranging from popular classics such as Roulette and Blackjack, to the obscure Indian game Bet on Teen Patti.</p>
<p>The games are designed to make you feel like you're at the casino in person. The Over-The-Top (OTT) technology is one way that Ezugi does this by letting you play with real players streaming live from selected casinos, but even games that don't use OTT deliver the live experience, with human croupiers and a real-life backdrop streamed smoothly to your desktop, mobile device, or Smart TV. The platform uses the latest SSL encryption technology so that your funds and financial data are secure.</p>
<p>Each Ezugi title offers a list of extras that vary depending on the type of game you choose. In Roulette, you can play multiple games at once (shown as picture-in-picture), try out nano games and even switch on some live music. Blackjack offers a 'Bet Behind' feature, which allows you to bet on another player's hand, while in Poker you can play against an unlimited number of players. All games are available to play 24/7, have a live chat service and allow dealer tipping, while many are also translated into several languages.</p>
<p>Note: If you're looking for slots, then unfortunately Ezugi only has these live-dealer games in its collection and don't plan to add any slots at the time of writing. However, this might change in the future given the company's ambitious recent expansion.</p>
