    <h1>Pompano Casino Eagle Mountain Casino Virgin Casino Las Vegas Jacks Casino Cleveland San Manuel Casin</h1>

<p>I'd like to adjust your statement a bit. We're affiliates with hundreds, probably over thousand of casinos. That's public information. We have no reason to hide it.</p>
<p>We also try to use our position on the affiliates market, Google search and our contact that we have on various casinos to help players when they deal with complaints against casinos. As Radka already pointed out, we have quite a straightforward process when it comes to dealing with player complaints.</p>
<p>The truth is that some casinos accuse us for being on players' side in most cases while some players accuse us for being on casinos side most of the time. I guess the reality is somewhere between, which is exactly what it should be.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the statistics for July. We still managed to get around 1.4 milion for the players despite some of you claiming we mostly support the casinos.</p>
<p>When I compare our approach and the licensing authorities in general, my experience is that we mostly go beyond their requirements when it comes to players' protection and their rights.</p>
