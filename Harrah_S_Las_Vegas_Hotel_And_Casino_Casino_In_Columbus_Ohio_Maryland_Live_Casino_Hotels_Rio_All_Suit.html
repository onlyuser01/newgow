    <h1>Harrah S Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Casino In Columbus Ohio Maryland Live Casino Hotels Rio All Suit</h1>

<p>Kambi Group has appointed Anders Ström as the new chair of the board as a result of Lars Stugemo’s decision to step down from the position held for close to a decade</p>
<p>It’s been a busy fall for Kambi Group, the premium business-to-business sportsbook supplier created to improve the sports betting experience for global players by partnering with visionary operators and “offering the ultimate in sports betting technology.”</p>
<p>At the end of September, the group announced a partnership extension with ATG, a horse racing and sports betting company in Sweden.</p>
<p>In October, Kambi agreed to power 711’s sportsbook in the Netherlands while also agreeing to use its advanced sportsbook technology to power LiveScore Group’s Virgin Bet and LiveScore Bet brands.</p>
<p>Now, following the publishing of its Q3 report that proved the importance of its recent deals and the news that the group would sponsor the EGR Power LatAm Summit 2023 in Rio de Janeiro between November 21-22 at the JW Marriott Hotel, Kambi has announced an important head of board change.</p>
<p>Anders Ström to Replace Lars Stugemo as Chair of the Board</p>
<p>The decision came after Lars Stugemo notified the group’s nomination committee of his decision to give up the position of chair of the board of directors that he held for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>The co-founder of the group this way expressed his desire not be be re-elected at the Kambi Annual General Meeting 2024 while explaining that both he and the Kambi “are fortunate that Kambi’s co-founder Anders Ström is also a member of the Board” and can quickly step up and take over.</p>
<p>Stugemo described his journey with the group as a “remarkable” one, reminiscing the early days when they served a small number of partners and their transformation into a leader on the market “with award-winning products and esteemed clients” worldwide.</p>
<p>The former chair of the bard called it “an immense privilege and joy” to have worked with the group alongside Ström, whom he praised for being an inspiring entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Ström, “Honored” to Take on the New Position</p>
<p>Ström, who founded the Kindred Group two and a half decades ago and helped co-found Kambi 13 years ago together with chief executive officer Kristian Nylén, is ready to take on the new role and harness his decades-long experience in the industry.</p>
<p>The new chair has been a member of the group’s board of directors since the formation of the sports betting platform provider.</p>
<p>Ström said it was an honor to be asked to become the group’s chair while expressing eagerness to “lead the board of a company which is showing real commercial momentum through recent partner signings” and changing the world of sports betting.</p>
<p>He further added that the group’s achievements do not solely strengthen their foothold in the industry but also “boost morale and drive” while paving the way for even more growth in the future.</p>
<p>Since he is a current member of the board of directors and the nomination committee, Ström had no say in the procedure that led to his nomination and appointment.</p>
