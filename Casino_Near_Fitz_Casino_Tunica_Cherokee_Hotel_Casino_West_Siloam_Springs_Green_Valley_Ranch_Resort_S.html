<p>Thank you, Seanzzzzz, for your emails. Could you kindly inform us whether you have previously disclosed a gambling issue while requesting the permanent closure of your account? Please be aware that without specifying the reason for your desire to have your account permanently blocked, it may be possible to reactivate it at various casinos through a simple request. The casino operates in compliance with its established rules and regulations.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
