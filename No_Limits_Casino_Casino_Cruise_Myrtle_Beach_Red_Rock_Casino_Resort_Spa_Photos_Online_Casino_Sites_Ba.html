    <h1>No Limits Casino Casino Cruise Myrtle Beach Red Rock Casino Resort Spa Photos Online Casino Sites Ba</h1>

<p>Have had to refer to gambling commission and also hire a private lawyer to now document all screenshots I have against this casino to take them to court. They have suspended/closed account following the attached email, of which none I done. Luckily I screenshotted all my history etc etc when I first realised they weren’t paying a few days after my original withdrawal request. Luckily I have the funds to take this further, but I feel for those who don’t that have had the exact same problem with this casino before me! I chased this for the last few weeks now, as they kept rejecting documents then accepting and asking for more etc then marking it as verified then changed again to unverified and would not come back to me - and now I know the whole time while they were clearly working out a way not to pay. They would ignore all emails and cut me off on live chat after waiting nearly an hour a time to be connected. I’m not bothered at this point about the £500. I just don’t want this casino company (inc BBCasino) to continue doing this to so many players . The ‘ask gamblers’ page have actually black listed them due to this problem so many times before! It is the first time I played at this BBcasino and I played the sweet bonanza live game and won, FAIRLY AND LEGALLY. Having spoke to people now regarding this casino, I was advised it is likely they will try get out of paying me and they will eventually send an email stating I broke some kind of terms and conditions and low and behold today I have received exactly that.</p>
