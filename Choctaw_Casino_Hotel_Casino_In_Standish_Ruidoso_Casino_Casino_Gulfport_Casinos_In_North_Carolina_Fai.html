    <h1>Choctaw Casino Hotel Casino In Standish Ruidoso Casino Casino Gulfport Casinos In North Carolina Fai</h1>

<p>There are many things that separate best casinos from rest of the competition. One of these factors is the overall user experience, including whether the casino is safe. In our view, a good user experience means that players don’t need to read the full T&amp;Cs (in fact nobody does that, maybe with the exception of some bonus hunters) and can rely on the fact that they’ll be treated fairly. In our view, safety means that it’s not easy to accidentally do something that will cancel your winnings.</p>
<p>We understand that there must be rules that apply to bonuses. Otherwise, it would be really easy to abuse them. But we believe these rules should be enforced by software, so that players can’t break them accidentally. Only because this isn’t that easy for casinos to do and almost no casino does this at the moment (we hope this will change in the future), we don’t penalize casinos for not having this feature. However, on the other hand, we expect the best casinos to individually look at every case where this rule may have been broken by an honest mistake.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the problem is that the player took another bonus before he withdrew winnings from the previous one. By doing this, he broke the rule that forbids having two bonuses active at the same time and also the rule that forbids taking a no deposit bonus while having a non-zero remaining balance.</p>
<p>We would like to emphasize three points in this case:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wagering was already completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player couldn’t get any advantage over the casino by his actions. There is nothing he could gain by applying for another bonus before withdrawing all of the remaining balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that bonus ends when the player cashes out and not when wagering is completed is counter intuitive. It might make sense for sticky bonuses (where the initial bonus amount is deducted at the end). But here it’s easy to understand that the player may think the old bonus is no longer active.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The conclusion is that it’s clear that player made an honest mistake. And he didn’t get any advantage over casino because of it. So, even if there is chance that the casino is right from a purely legal perspective, we consider voiding the winnings co be clearly unfair.</p>
<p>If the casino refuses to take specific circumstances of this case into consideration, it may raise the question whether they really apply this rule to protect themselves, or whether it’s just an excuse to not pay out the winnings. Even if there are no bad intensions, we still consider any casino that acts like this to be unsafe for players and we’ll have to decrease its rating. Therefore, we would like to ask Fair Go casino representatives once more to reconsider their position.</p>
