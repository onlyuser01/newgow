    <h1>Lucky Creek Casino Login Legends Bay Casino 4 Bears Casino And Lodge Casino Game Online Biloxi Hotel</h1>

<p>Dear Hippie,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding the screenshot of your undelivered email. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found https://24mcasino.com/templates/company/responsible_gaming:</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>Self- Exclusion is a more extensive way to control your activity at 24monaco.com.</p>
<p>Self-exclusion means that you decide to close your account for a period up to 3 months. In case you wish to Self- Exclude your account, please contact our Customer Support Team who will be happy to assist you."</p>
<p>https://24mcasino.com/templates/company/terms_and_conditions:</p>
<p>"Self exclude or Timeout - We will only reply to emails sent to support@24monaco.com for this action and clearly mark in the subject line 'Account Closure. Any emails not stating your reason for closing eg; gambling problem will not be actioned as an urgent request. We take these requests seriously but due to the high levels of emails it may take us some time to reply. Any deposits made before the account is closed will be accepted and are non refundable."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email to support@24monaco.com (even if it’s the same one you have used before) including all the relevant information to the email address above. In this way, you’ll have proof of such an action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. You can include me in the copy of that email (my email address is petronela.k@casino.guru). Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked as "Self-exclusion" you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. If it won’t work this time, we will intervene.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
