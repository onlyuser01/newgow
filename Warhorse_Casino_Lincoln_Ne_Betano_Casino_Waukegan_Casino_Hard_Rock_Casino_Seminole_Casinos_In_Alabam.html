    <h1>Warhorse Casino Lincoln Ne Betano Casino Waukegan Casino Hard Rock Casino Seminole Casinos In Alabam</h1>

<p>I registered a new online website which is quite reputable.</p>
<p>It has a welcome bonus in three parts : first, second and third deposit.</p>
<p>And they have the rule that has two different wallets one is the cash wallet and one is the bonus account as usual.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>There are games that are able to play ONLY using the "cash".</p>
<p>While the other games is anything goes.</p>
<p>And the other rule is that you have to play all your money in the cash wallet before you can touch the bonus account.</p>
<h1>Story</h1>
<p>The first deposit went in and I played. I lost.</p>
<p>Second bonus went in and I played and I lost.</p>
<h1>plot</h1>
<p>My Third deposit is where problem came.</p>
<p>For example I deposited 1,000 and it is a 100% bonus matchup.</p>
<p>So now I have :</p>
<p>1000 cash</p>
<p>1000 bonus</p>
<p>And I went to play a game which ONLY allow Cash (no bonus play)</p>
<p>In the game it shows I only have a thousand which is correct.</p>
<p>Now if I were to play let's say 10 rounds of 100bucks each.</p>
<p>And assume that I won every single round.</p>
<p>But at the end of the 10 rounds my cash wallet is zero.</p>
<p>Which means, when I play the game <em>which only allows cash</em></p>
<p>I used my cash to bet, but when I win.</p>
<p>It does not pay me cash, it goes into the bonus wallet.</p>
<p>So I went to ask the admin and apparently my second deposit bonus was not completely zero so I have that wagering requirement there.</p>
<p>And when I asked her if I could cancel the bonus she said no she cannot do anything about it.</p>
<p>So apparently I have to do the wagering requirements for both deposits and both bonuses.</p>
<p>But thats fine. This part I somewhat understand the logic.</p>
<p>But what I can't understand is if I am using Pure Cash to bet.</p>
<p>And you do not pay me a single cent whenever I win.</p>
<p>Which means my cash wallet will inevitably be zero!</p>
<p>Regardless of how I win!</p>
<p>!! EVEN if I won a jackpot for godsakes.</p>
<p>And the admin kept repeating saying that I need to do wagering requirements.</p>
<p>I understand it is my fault that I have to do double triple quadruple.. of the wagering requirements, put that part is aside. I get it.</p>
<h1>thoughts</h1>
<p>What I don't understand is why do they force me to play THE CASH FIRST before I touch the bonus but yet takes the winnings from the cash bets and put it into the bonus wallet.</p>
<p>I mean if they are going to do that...</p>
<p>Why even separate the wallets?</p>
<p>it's going to be bonus by the end of the day anyway.</p>
<p>Why must we play cash first it doesn't make a difference</p>
<p>Why do they even have games that only can be played with cash and not bonus they might as well right there limited spins only per day.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I'm renting but I'm really just so frustrated that I cannot understand the logic and the admin is just keep repeating the same thing about wagering requirements.</p>
<p>I mean if I'm not wrong.</p>
<p>When I play cash and I win.</p>
<p>and I continue playing, I will still reach the wagering requirements .</p>
<p>Which bytheway, then ALLOWS me to withdraw the money out from the website !!!!</p>
<p>so what's the use of them TAKING ALL THE WINNINGS and put it into the bonus wallet ?</p>
<p>Other than not letting me play "Cash Only" games.</p>
<p>Also if any of you guys actually thinking like,</p>
<p>part goes to bonus</p>
<p>part goes to cash</p>
<p>no it is not.</p>
<p>I use 100% cash, fresh deposit, first game of the day.</p>
<p>I lost 100% cash.</p>
<p>I never got a single cent from anything.</p>
<p>Except my Bonus Wallet was doubled.</p>
<p>When I came out of the game, because I don't have anymore cash!!!!!</p>
<p>Every single winning cent went into the Bonus Wallet.</p>
<p>So please help me guys anyone just please explain to me the logic or tell me the system is faulty or something I just want to understand.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm stupid maybe I'm dumb or maybe I'm just crazy.</p>
<p>But someone...</p>
<p>Show me the way...</p>
<p>please....</p>
