<p>LL Lucky Games AB Group has just secured a B2B license from the UK Gambling Commission through ReelNRG Limited, which is part of the Group, the company shared via an email press release. As a result, Lady Luck Games and ReelNRG content will now both be available to players in the UK, bringing a variety of excellent titles to regulated and licensed operators.</p>
<p>A UKGC license is pivotal in LL Games Group’s ambitions to grow its footprint in some of the most prominent European markets and sign content deals with leading gaming operators. Moving forward, players at partner operators will have access to a number of Lady Luck Games, such as Beetle Bailey, SpinJoy Society Megaways, Astro Anna, and The Treasures of Tizoc.</p>
<p>Similarly, players will also have access to a range of ReelNRG titles, to name DarkSpells, Mr Mostacho, Genie’s Gold and so many others. Both studios are determined to add more titles to their portfolios in the coming months as well. The news was welcomed by LL Lucky Games Group CEO and Co-Founder Mads Jørgensen who hailed the partnership as another important milestone for the company.</p>
<p>"Securing a UKGC gaming license is a significant moment for our company. We are now able to provide our premium gaming content to our partners in the world`s preeminent and established market, the United Kingdom," Jørgensen noted.</p>
<p>Securing a license into the UK market was something that the entire team had been looking forward to, the executive continued and added that thanks to this, Lady Luck Games would now have many new doors opened for it.</p>
<p>Lady Luck Games has definitely been making strides in iGaming space of late. The company launched its first Megaways slot with Novibet in Greece at the beginning of the month, and the company has been growing its international footprint through a rollout of its content portfolio in Latin America with Logrand Entertainment Group in Mexico.</p>
<p>Lady Luck Games has also been keen to get the word for its products out and has teamed up with RAW Arena to bolster its distribution efforts. The company has developed a number of other games besides the one mentioned above, including Valhöll Wild Hammers, Cherry Supreme, and many casual games such as Yatzy, Spider, Ludo, and many more.</p>
