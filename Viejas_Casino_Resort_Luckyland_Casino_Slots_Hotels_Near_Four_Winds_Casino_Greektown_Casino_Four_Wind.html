    <h1>Viejas Casino Resort Luckyland Casino Slots Hotels Near Four Winds Casino Greektown Casino Four Wind</h1>

<p>Good evening, I turn to you for the lack of seriousness with the Betsala casino, and at the same time I request a refund of all the deposits made in the casino, as damage, I deceive the player, I feel cheated since they allow players from Peru to make payments to the casino deposits with affiliated banks in Peru, purses from Peru such as cash payment, Tupay, BBVA, but the big surprise is that it is not possible to request withdrawals, they do not have authorization or license to make the charges that a client requests when withdrawing their earnings, This is what they told me in support, what a surprise situation since May they indicate that they will solve it soon but to date the problem remains the same.</p>
<p>It is uncomfortable that the casino support chat indicates that everything is fine, I make deposits again, one confident of the good faith and seriousness of the casino when in reality not even until the current date of August there is no solution, they simply ask for the apologies of the case and they do not provide any more details or any additional alternative on how to make withdrawals, unfortunately it was a waste of time and investment of money, I do not know how many more people are in the same situation as me and it is worrying that this casino continues to accept deposits, when there is actually no probability of withdrawals.</p>
<p>I hope I can count on your support in this case since the casino is very unfair and it is not clear, since they allow players from Peru to play make deposits and when generating withdrawals it is impossible to do so to the extent that the player loses his winnings for so long. waiting and frustration.</p>
<p>He sent evidence of all the deposits made, the promotion of this casino with the logos of Peruvian Banks and the error that has persisted for months when requesting withdrawals</p>
<p>Also mention that I have my account verified, what this casino is doing with PERU players is a joke.</p>
<p>ATTE:</p>
<p>YAMIR ****</p>
