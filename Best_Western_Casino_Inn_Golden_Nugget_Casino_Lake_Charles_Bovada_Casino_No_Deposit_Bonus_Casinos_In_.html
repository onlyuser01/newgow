<p>Eriksson, who currently serves as chief product officer at the group, will retain his current position in addition to the new appointment</p>
<p>PressEnter Group, the name behind a number of influential iGaming brands, has reinforced its leadership team with another leadership promotion. Following the appointment of Philip Bell as chief commercial officer in November, the company has named Hampus Eriksson as deputy chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Eriksson, who currently serves as chief product officer at the group, will retain his current position in addition to the new appointment.</p>
<p>For reference, his time as CPO saw him rebuild the company’s product capabilities and processes from the ground up. Eriksson’s two years as the company’s CPO also saw him launch PressEnter’s inaugural sports betting brand, XLBet. He also played a key role in helping the group make forays into Ontario and Romania.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Eriksson guided investments in technical enablers to drive the business. He was also instrumental in the completion of the company’s full cloud migration.</p>
<p>CEO Merzoug Will Be Able to Focus on Long-Term Projects</p>
<p>As deputy CEO of the company, Eriksson will now have a wider remit. In the new position, he will be responsible for delivering the company’s strategies and goals. The appointee commented on his new position, saying that the management buyout has left the company in a much stronger position.</p>
<p>For reference, the company went through a management buyout in November 2022, leading to a major change of strategy.</p>
<p>Eriksson added:</p>
<p>I am thrilled to have been promoted to the role of Deputy CEO and look forward to working alongside Lahcene to lead this organization to the greatness I know it can achieve. Hampus Eriksson, CEO, PressEnter Group</p>
<p>Lahcene Merzoug, the group’s chief executive officer, also commented on the matter, praising Eriksson’s hard work as CPO. Because of his proven track record, Eriksson will be able to improve the company’s efficiency, Merzoug believes.</p>
<p>I have worked with Hampus for more than ten years. He is a highly experienced executive and product specialist and knows exactly how to run a business that is as effective as it is efficient. Lahcene Merzoug, CEO, PressEnter Group</p>
<p>Merzoug also mentioned that Eriksson’s appointment as deputy CEO will free up some of his own time, allowing him to focus more on strategy and long-term projects.</p>
<p>PressEnter Group operates a number of iGaming brands, such as XLBet, Nitro Casino, Ultra Casino, 21.com and Just Spin. The company also has agreements with a variety of providers, powering its brands with premium content.</p>
