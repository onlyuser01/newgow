<p>Atlanta United vs New England Revolution is on the program on Wednesday, May 31, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Neither team can be proud of their recent form, but both are hopeful that changes soon</p>
<p>Atlanta United is without a win over New England Revolution since 2019, but the betting odds suggest “The Five Stripes” are going to win on Wednesday. Their form isn’t great, but they definitely have a fantastic roster. In fact, their squad is the most valuable in the entire MLS.</p>

<p>Moneyline Odds Atlanta United -120 Draw +275 New England Revolution +280</p>

<p>Reasons Why Atlanta United Is Favored to Win on May 31</p>
<p>Atlanta United is sitting in the No. 5 position in the MLS Eastern Conference with a 6-5-4 record (23 points), but their recent form isn’t great. The boys from Georgia are 1-2-2 in their last five MLS games, conceding nine goals along the way.</p>
<p>Their defense is actually their Achilles’ heel this season. Atlanta United and Charlotte are the two MLS teams with the worst defense, each allowing 25 goals thus far. “The Five Stripes” are horrible at the back, but their offense has been phenomenal in 2023.</p>
<p>Actually, with 29 goals scored in 15 games, Atlanta is the highest-scoring team in the MLS. Georgios Giakoumakis is their scoring leader with eight goals to his name. The most valuable player from Atlanta’s roster – Thiago Almada – is their second-best scorer with six goals. He’s also recorded eight assists, which is more than any other player in the MLS.</p>
<p>New England Revolution Struggling With Injuries</p>
<p>There are at least six players from New England’s roster who will miss Wednesday’s game. This includes Colombian winger Dylan Borrero who’s this team’s second-most expensive player. Midfielder Brandon Bye will also miss this game, who’s one of New England’s players with the most playing time this season.</p>
<p>Still, even with them on the pitch, New England would still be seen as the underdog in Wednesday’s game. After all, this team’s recent form is dreadful with one draw and three losses in the last four MLS games.</p>
<p>The main reason behind their poor run is their horrible defense. In those four goals, New England conceded nine goals.</p>
<p>Atlanta United vs New England Revolution Prediction</p>
<p>Atlanta United looks ready to end its winless run this Wednesday. This team has a much better roster than New England, so beating them shouldn’t be that hard. Sure, they haven’t done it since 2019 but now seems like a perfect opportunity to change that.</p>
<p>Picks: Atlanta United to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
