    <h1>Casino Luck Horseshoe Casino Hammond In Free 100 Casino Chip No Deposit Choctaw Casino Pocola Ok Cas</h1>

<p>Betcris’s ongoing expansion continues with the appointment of iGaming industry veteran Lucas Lebleu as the new casino director. The company that is determined to freshen up its sports betting and gaming operations also signed an important partnership with FC Juárez to strengthen its foothold in Mexico in June. Towards the end of March, Betcris became the official sponsor of nine different soccer clubs based in Honduras. One month prior to that, the operator announced a distribution deal with Vibra Gaming for the LatAm region.</p>
<p>Betcris to Rely on Lebleu’s Expertise as an Industry veteran</p>
<p>Lebleu will be responsible for supervising all tactical changes in the company’s promotional offers and operations meant to help it reach its revenue targets. His rich expertise as a veteran in the iGaming industry will help “one of the most respected brands in Latin America” reach its growth goals. Lebleu will be busy implementing and constantly improving all game testing procedures and the functionality of casino apps. He will also focus on optimizing content and finding ways to reflect the brand’s creative design messages in its core values. The new casino director will also implement the brand’s casino strategy and maintain the integrity of the company’s casino-related activities.</p>
<p>Lebleu recognized Betcris’ pristine reputation in the Latin America area, expressing his gratitude for the opportunity to return to Costa Rica, the place where he initiated his igaming career two and a half decades ago. The new director spent many years in Costa Rica prior to moving to Spain for his new position in Gibraltar in 2009. Betcris strongly believes Lebleu’s proven track record and powerful focus on commercial operations will turn into important assets for the constantly expanding brand.</p>
<p>Reputable Positions in B2B and B2C Roles</p>
<p>During the decade he spent in Europe, Lebleu landed important positions in both Business to Consumer and Business to Business areas. He spent four years working for William Hill, where he was a French country manager and a Spanish territory manager. There, he worked with web development, mobile development and designer experts to create the best products, while cross-selling all types of e-Gaming products including casino, poker, skill games and Vegas products. Lebleu was also country manager for Rizk.es as well as head of sales for Europe and LatAm in Andalusia. He also held valuable positions at IBM and Probability.</p>
<p>Lebleu wanted to give thanks to JD, Carlos Soto, Fernando Garita, Gabriel Nuñez and Mauricio Delgado together with the Human Resources team who helped ease his transfer.</p>
