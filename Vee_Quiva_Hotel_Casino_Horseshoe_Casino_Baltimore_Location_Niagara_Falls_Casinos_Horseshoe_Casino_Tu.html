<p>Dear RetVet22,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your withdrawal issue.</p>
<p>Please understand, that the variety and accessibility of payment methods are not managed by the casino exclusively. Several factors as the Licensing Authority, geolocation, contracts with the payment providers, and bank restrictions, all have a major influence. If a payment method was available for deposits, it doesn’t mean necessarily, that it will be offered for withdrawals too, also it can be discontinued at any time. Unfortunately, casinos are sometimes powerless and limited in offering payment methods to their customers.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you decide to open the bank account according to the support's instructions. If the option won't work, and you'll still experience issues with withdrawing your winnings, please let us know and we'll intervene and try to assist you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
