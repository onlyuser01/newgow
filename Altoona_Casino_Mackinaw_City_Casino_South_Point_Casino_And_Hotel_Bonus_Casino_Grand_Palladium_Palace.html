<p>Enter the Cave Full of Fossils and Secret Treasures</p>
<p>The pay-both-ways game invites players to set on the “spelunking adventure” of their lifetime by entering the cave packed with dinosaur bones and other biological wonders waiting to be explored.</p>
<p>As they keep exploring the cave, digging, and messing with nature, players are prone to come across a plethora of secret riches waiting to be uncovered.</p>
<p>With each new win scored on the reels, the symbols are swept off the grid to make room for new symbols that will tumble down and generate fresh winning combos.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s chief gaming officer, Mark McGinley, spoke about the Wild Stack Frenzy slot with “huge stacks of Wilds waiting to fill the reels” that lets players the subterranean chamber storing massive wins.</p>
<p>McGinley also called the new slot “another thrilling product for players to sink their teeth into,” while taking the opportunity to praise the way their core game offering complements their YG Masters roster of games.</p>
<p>At the end of August, the company made its debut in Bulgaria with the help of a content agreement inked with Inbet.</p>
<p>Wild Stacks, Free Spins, and Bonus Buy Features</p>
<p>Once the avalanche of chain wins is triggered, Wild Stacks can drop during each new spin. The Wild Stacks vary from three to six symbols high and they are a constant presence on the grid or right above.</p>
<p>During cascade wins, the Wild Stack symbols are seen dropping off the reels and revealing higher multipliers as the stack is seen getting lengthier.</p>
<p>Players who are lucky enough to come across the very rare glowing mushroom symbols are instantly carried to the Free Spins round that awards at least seven free spins. To enter the round, players need to land a minimum of three Free Spins symbols.</p>
<p>While the Free Spins mode is engaged, players enjoy additional opportunities to retrigger massive Stacks of up to 10 symbols high that will also attract corresponding multipliers for a bigger win potential.</p>
<p>In some jurisdictions, players will be allowed to jump right into the Free Spins round action by purchasing the Buy Bonus in exchange for 60x the stake.</p>
<p>In September, Yggdrasil launched an impressive number of new titles, including Beasty Blox GigaBlox, Hercules 10K WAYS via a ReelPlay partnership, and GigaGong GigaBlox, to name just a few.</p>
