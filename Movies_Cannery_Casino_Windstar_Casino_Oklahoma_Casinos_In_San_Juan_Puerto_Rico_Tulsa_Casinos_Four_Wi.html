<p>NetBet, a leading iGaming operator, has continued to strengthen its content library with leading suppliers and development studios from the industry</p>
<p>The latest partnership sees the prominent international brand sign a content collaboration with R. Franco Digital, an established developer of online casino products. The latter’s titles are now integrated into NetBet’s library of games, with R. Franco Digital bringing such popular picks as Gnomos Respins, Red Mantis and 40 Super 7 among the available titles.</p>
<p>R. Franco Digital Focuses on Growing Reach</p>
<p>R. Franco Digital also develops roulette, bingo, video poker, and other games, that are also going to be available as part of the content tie-up. Commenting on this partnership, NetBet PR manager Claudia Georgevici hailed the latest in a string of deals that sees her brand further reinforce its content footprint and presence. Georgevici noted:</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with R. Franco Games and bring their award-winning games to our players. NetBet PR manager Claudia Georgevici</p>
<p>She further said that NetBet was fully committed to continuing to deliver an exceptional gaming experience that is aligned with the brand’s own value and delivers precisely what players are thrilled about and want to experience first-hand.</p>
<p>NetBet has been delivering on this promise and commitment through a string of similar partnerships, including individual partnerships with distinguished suppliers such as Spinomenal and Platipus.</p>
<p>The games that are now being onboarded by R. Franco Digital are built on HTML5 technology, making it much easier for players at NetBet to experience them on mobile and desktop, and take them on the go.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, R. Franco Digital online sales manager Guillermo Ruipérez was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see his company expand with NetBet, a trusted name in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Bringing Worthwhile Games to a Global Brand</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to embark on this new journey with such a leading operator,” Ruipérez added. The sales manager was similarly excited to be providing its content to one of the most demanding player bases that NetBet has been able to build.</p>
<p>R. Franco Digital has been busy building up its footprint. The company has signed a similar partnership with Betsson, boosting its reach in the process, and ensuring that its games are available with the 20+ brands operated by the group.</p>
<p>Another prominent content deal was negotiated with 888casino in Spain, as both companies seek to secure a broader footprint in regulated markets.</p>
