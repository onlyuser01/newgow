    <h1>Rio All Suites And Casino Las Vegas New Orleans Harrah S Casino Firekeepers Casino Hotel Fort Lauder</h1>

<p>I did not take a screen shot of the bonus that said it was exspired. With how much i had won that vegas rush subtracted from my winnings i would assume any bonus that was used had play through vegas rush subtracted the play thru off my winnings with what remained my deposit should take care of my withdraw since my deposit did not credit me with a bonus $ 35.00 would be 350% 20 free spins ect ect .vegas rush should up hold there obligation as well as what they advertise to the consumer . I have to close the bank account i have re opend a new bank account it is more problems then it is worth . I was just trying to have some relax time as well as a lil fun by trusting. Vegas Rush is not anything like being in Las Vegas. .Thank You Mr Guru i see that i will not be getting my withdraw. My deposit the extra money that was taking out of my account back i appreciate your time trying to help me with this matter. Mr . Guru just to correct something it was not part of my credits were confiscated it was all my credits that i was allowed to have which was a total of $ 2, 500.00 as well as another $ 3,000.00 i won but was not credited .</p>
