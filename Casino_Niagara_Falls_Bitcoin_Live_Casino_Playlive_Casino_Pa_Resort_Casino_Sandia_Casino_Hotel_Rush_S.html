<p>RSI Hires Familiar Face as Brand Ambassador</p>
<p>Payton, a native Chicagoan, moved to Arizona in 2020. As a brand ambassador for BetRivers, she joins the RSI Family in Arizona and Illinois. Payton will represent RSI in a variety of ways, including through the creation of content on sports betting and a wide range of content on sports and culture for the gaming operator.</p>
<p>Payton will appear as an ambassador in BetRivers TV, radio commercials, podcasts and social media interviews. Her own social media platforms will also be integrated into the branding opportunities.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to be joining the BetRivers team. It will be fun to bring a pop culture spin to sports entertainment and gaming. It’s especially exciting to be interacting with RSI’s sports betting fans in my native state of Illinois and in Arizona which I now call home.” Brittney Payton, RSI’s newest Brand Ambassador</p>
<p>Payton was awarded a Chicago Emmy in recognition of her role as co-host on WGN-TV’s Chicago’s Best. Her presentation of the Walter Payton Man-of-the-Year Award at each Super Bowl is another highlight.</p>
<p>Mattias Stetz, COO of RSI, said that Payton is a great addition to the RSI group of companies, which includes BetRivers.com, PlaySugarHouse.com and BetRivers.com. “Her enthusiasm for sports and pop culture, combined with her extensive experience working as a television personality, will be a tremendous asset to our sports betting community,” he added.</p>
<p>Rush Street Enjoys Strong 2021</p>
<p>RSI has had a strong run this year. It has launched in new markets in the US and Latin America and continues to enhance its portfolio. Having Laura McAllister Cox as Chief Compliance Officer has given the company additional exposure. She was just named to this year’s Top 10 List of the Most Influential Women in iGaming by iGaming Business.</p>
<p>RSI was also chosen as the iGaming Operator Of The Year For North America at the Gaming Intelligence Awards last month.</p>
<p>The company reported strong financial results for the third quarter of the year, showing a 57% increase over the same period last year. Having recently added Arizona, New York and Ontario to its portfolio, RSI is setting itself up for an even stronger 2022.</p>
