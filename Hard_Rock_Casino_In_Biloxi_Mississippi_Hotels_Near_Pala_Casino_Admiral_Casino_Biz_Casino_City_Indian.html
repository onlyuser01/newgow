<p>The executive with more than a decade of experience within the gambling vertical will assume his new role in January next year</p>
<p>The fast-growing and globally-recognized iGaming company, Glitnor Group, announced its plans to strengthen its C-suite with a strategic new appointment. On Monday, the company revealed that it selected the gambling industry expert with extensive experience, Richard Brown, for the role of chief executive officer (CEO).</p>
<p>Judging by the recent announcement, the executive, who has more than a decade of experience within the gambling vertical, will step into the new CEO role effective from January 2024. As CEO, Brown is expected to play a key role in the growth and expansion of Glitnor within the online gambling vertical.</p>
<p>His appointment comes on the heels of constant growth reported by the company with its business-to-customer brands HappyCasino and LuckyCasino. At the same time, Glitnor continues to expand within the business-to-business (B2B) vertical and Brown is expected to oversee such processes too.</p>
<p>Brown’s professional background includes nearly eight years with the leading gaming and entertainment company, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG). For nearly four years, he spearheaded GiG as its CEO, which resulted in significant benefits, including record revenues reported for the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Similarly to the success at GiG, Brown is expected to leverage his extensive knowledge and insight to help Glitnor grow further. With the start of 2024 and his appointment as CEO, the company plans to keep up the positive momentum gained this year and expand its presence in strategic iGaming markets within Latin America, North America, as well as Europe.</p>
<p>Brown Is Excited to Join Glitnor’s C-Suite</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Brown said that he is delighted to become a part of the C-suite and Glitnor and play a key role in the company’s expansion. “The teams have built a fantastic position in the industry and I look forward to working with them to further capitalize on the number of opportunities the business has ahead of it,” he said.</p>
<p>“I am honored to take on the role of CEO of Glitnor Group.“ Richard Brown, incoming CEO at Glitnor</p>
<p>The upcoming CEO spoke about the success of Glitnor in recent years and said that he will be excited to help deliver value for the company’s shareholders and help it reach new business goals. Finally, Brown acknowledged that the last eight years at GiG helped him accumulate significant experience and unique insight within the online gambling vertical.</p>
<p>“By appointing Richard, I believe Glitnor has secured one of the industry’s top C-level talents and I’m looking forward to the positive impact he’ll have on our business as we look to strengthen our brands and enter more markets in the future.“ Jörgen Nordlund, co-founder at Glitnor</p>
<p>Jörgen Nordlund, Glitnor’s co-founder, welcomed Brown to the company’s senior management team. He explained that the appointment strengthens further the company’s C-suite, which will play a key role in its future growth. Finally, Nordlund outlined that Brown brings extensive experience from GiG and predicted that it will help him in his new role.</p>
