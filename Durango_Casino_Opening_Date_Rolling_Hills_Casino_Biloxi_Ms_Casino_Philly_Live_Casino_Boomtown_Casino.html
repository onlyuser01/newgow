    <h1>Durango Casino Opening Date Rolling Hills Casino Biloxi Ms Casino Philly Live Casino Boomtown Casino</h1>

<p>A three-time Super Bowl champion signed an exclusive brand and content deal with an online gaming brand to become its ambassador and boost fan engagement.</p>
<p>Former Denver Broncos player and veteran NFL analyst Mark Schlereth joined BetRivers to become the brand’s ambassador, Rush Street Interactive (RSI), the operator of the online gaming brand, announced.</p>
<p>Mark Schlereth is respected as one of the top NFL analysts with two decades of covering the pro games on sports networks under his belt. Adding Mark and his vast experience as a champion player and NFL analyst will bolster our football coverage and give our bettors key NFL insights and analysis as they make their sports wagering decisions.” Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>With 12 seasons played in total with the Washington Redskins and Denver Broncos, Mark Schlereth is celebrated as one of the premiere guards to have featured in the NFL, and his addition to the BetRivers.com “Bet with a Winner” campaign is set to boost the brand’s engagement with football fans.</p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to interacting with BetRivers players. It’s one thing to offer my insights and analysis on television and radio broadcasts, but it’s really exciting to share my experience with bettors during call-ins and through other BetRivers Network platforms to help them make educated betting decisions.” Mark Schlereth, Ambassador, BetRivers</p>
<p>In his new role, Schlereth will actively participate in the creation of unique content on the BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse platforms for NFL fans nationwide, and, in particular, for Denver Broncos fans in Colorado.</p>
<p>Unique Perspective and Insights</p>
<p>“Stink,” as Schlereth was known during his years as a player, will offer his insight and unique game perspective across all BetRivers social media, digital and traditional media channels via weekly videos and TV, radio, podcast and media interviews.</p>
<p>The former NFL Pro Bowler and three-time Super Bowl champ, who was featured regularly for 16 years as an NFL studio analyst at ESPN, contributing to the Mike &amp; Mike in the Morning weekly show, is currently a commentator on FOX NFL for NFL game broadcasts and also participates as an analyst on FS1 television.</p>
<p>As an ambassador for BetRivers, Mark Schlereth is joining NFL Legend Jerome Bettis, who was announced as a brand ambassador for the BetRivers Sportsbook &amp; Casino brand earlier in 2021, to actively engage with the company’s upcoming promotions and events.</p>
<p>Through its brands BetRivers.com and PlaySugarHouse.com, RSI is operational in ten US jurisdictions – Pennsylvania, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Indiana, Virginia, Colorado, Iowa and West Virginia – as well as actively offering its online casino and sportsbook in Colombia via RushBet.co.</p>
