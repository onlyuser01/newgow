    <h1>Planet Hollywood Casino Cripple Creek Hotels And Casinos San Manuel Indian Bingo Casino Online Casin</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>i'm from morroco, i played and i won in Mystake.com, i tried to withdraw 7 or 8 times via Tether/TRC20, all the tried has been rejected, btw my account is verified, the binance and the mystake account. When i talked to agent, he told to change the payment method, i did Tether but Tether/ERC20. Without any suprise, it has been rejected again. Now i'm not "allowed" to withdraw, i have to verify my skill account, and even my bank statement prooving that i made deposits, ( i don't understand cuz deposits are made in their website so they can check it easily ) when i ask the agent about the exact step that i have to do, he answer like i'm asking another question. And i asked for the limit too, the agent told me 7500 USDT so i'm not even reaching it.</p>
<p>I feel that the site is trying to make me play again with my money or just not withdraw. BTW MY FREIND DID A WITHDRAW WITH TRC20 THE SAME DAY AND IT WORKED, PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU CAN AND READ THIS.</p>
