<p>IGaming solutions provider Aspire Global has entered a partnership with the esports and betting-focused tech company Esports Technologies. The agreement will see both sides benefiting from each other’s solutions.</p>
<p>Aspire and Esports Technologies Will Help Each Other Out</p>
<p>With the deal in place, Aspire Global will be adopting its new partner’s proprietary odds modeling, market creation, and trading feed to its own platform.</p>
<p>In return, Esports Technologies will also get to use many of Aspire Global’s features and services. The esports tech company will benefit from its partner’s business-to-business iGaming solutions like its newly released AspireEngage customer relations management system, as well as its BtoBet sportsbook games and offerings and the Kamambe business-to-consumer brand.</p>
<p>Esports Technologies’ chief operating officer, Bart Barden, described his company’s situation as an “exciting rapid growth phase”. The tech company’s current focus, according to him, is to expand the business and reach multiple markets through its variety of offerings.</p>
<p>In order to boost its performance and establish itself as a unique and reliable leader in the esports betting market, Esports Technologies searched for a powerful partner that it found in Aspire Global.</p>
<p>“In Aspire Global, we have found a long-term partner that meets our high demands,” Barden stated.</p>
<p>Aspire Global’s chief executive officer, Tsachi Maimon, is delighted to welcome Esports Technologies as an esports partner. Maimon is thrilled to “integrate Esports Technologies groundbreaking and engaging wagering products” on Aspire Global’s platform and is looking forward to collaborating with the new partner for providing the best esports proprietary solutions to iGaming operators.</p>
<p>What the Agreement Means to Both Parties</p>
<p>Both parties are likely to benefit a lot from the current agreement. Esports Technologies will have the chance to boost the quality of its product even further. The tech company recently applied for a patent of esports betting odds generator with the intentions of further differentiating itself on the market.</p>
<p>Esports Technologies is also a prominent supporter of reinforcing the esports scene to ensure the safest and highest quality wagering options to bettors. It partnered with the Esports Integrity Commission in order to support its fight against all the corrupt practices in esports.</p>
<p>Aspire Global will also get to strengthen its brand and establish itself on the market. The iGaming solutions provider marked record-high revenue in the first quarter of 2021 and is keen on grabbing the momentum.</p>
<p>The company is currently powering the sportsbooks of several operators. Last month, Aspire Global signed a deal with JNS Gaming that will have it power up the latter company’s casino and sportsbook. Other operators that have recently partnered with Aspire are Amelco and Funfair Casino.</p>
