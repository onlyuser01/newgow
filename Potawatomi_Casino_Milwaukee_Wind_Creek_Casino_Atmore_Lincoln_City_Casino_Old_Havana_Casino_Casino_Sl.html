<p>Nikola Jokic Keeps Writing the Denver Nuggets History</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the two-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic recorded another triple-double, scoring 32 points, 21 rebounds, and 10 assists. He absolutely destroyed the opposition, helping the Nuggets win 109-94. It was his second triple-double in the 2023 NBA Finals.</p>

<p>Actually, the only time he didn‚Äôt record a triple-double, Jokic made a double-double, scoring 41 points along the way. It happened in Game 2, in which Jokic was pretty much the only Denver player who put on a show. This explains why the Nuggets ended up losing the game.</p>
<p>In the third game of the NBA Finals, he had the help of Jamal Murray, who scored 34 points and made 10 assists and as many rebounds. Aaron Gordon was also very good that evening, as well as Christian Braun and a few others. If they‚Äôre going to make it 3-1 on June 9, they will need to put on at least as equally good performance.</p>
<p>The Heat Need to Win Game 4</p>
<p>It‚Äôs very important for the Miami Heat to win on Friday evening and make it 2-2 in the 2023 NBA Finals. Why? Because after Game 4, the series moves back to Ball Arena in Denver. And that‚Äôs where the Nuggets are nothing short of amazing. In fact, they‚Äôve lost just one home game in the 2023 postseason.</p>
<p>The loss in question, however, happened to the Heat. Still, it was a very narrow loss, meaning that the Heat mustn‚Äôt rely on that game. Instead, they need to focus entirely on Game 4.</p>
<p>They‚Äôll have their fans to support them from the stands of Kaseya Center, but what needs to worry them is that the same was the case in the previous game. They played in front of their crowd, but the Nuggets absolutely outplayed them on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nuggets vs. Heat Game 4 Prediction</p>
<p>The Nuggets looked incredible on Wednesday, which has certainly given them a massive confidence boost. It‚Äôs just the opposite when it comes to the Miami Heat players, who now probably realize that their chance of winning the 2023 NBA Championship is very slim. Nevertheless, they‚Äôll give their best to win Game 4, but we honestly doubt they‚Äôll pull it off. Raging Jokic and his teammates won‚Äôt let them do much on June 9.</p>
<p>Picks: Denver Nuggets to win and cover the spread</p>
