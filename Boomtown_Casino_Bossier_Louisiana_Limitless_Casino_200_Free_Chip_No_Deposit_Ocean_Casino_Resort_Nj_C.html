<p>Yggdrasil, a renowned iGaming content developer and aggregator, has released a new slot game called Cannonade! As the name suggests, Cannonade! is a pirate-themed title with a lot of cannon action going on.</p>
<p>Starting with the exciting stuff, the new game offers a maximum win of 17,000x the bet thanks to a selection of exciting features. By playing Cannonade!, players can use mechanics such as Free Spins, Gambles and Win Streaks to their advantage and make the most out of their wagers.</p>
<p>The highlight of the newly-launched slot is Win Streak, a function that holds all winning symbols in place after a win. This allows players to make some terrific combinations and multiply their winnings by providing them with more winning ways.</p>
<p>Cannonade! Metrics</p>
<p>Reels: 6</p>
<p>Rows: 5</p>
<p>Paylines: 120-7,776</p>
<p>RTP: 96% / 94% / 90.5% / 86%</p>
<p>Hit Freq: 20.18%</p>
<p>Max Win: 20,000x</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0,20/20</p>
<p>Sail the Storm with Free Spins</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Free Spins bonus mode is activated when a player lands on three or more bonus symbols during the same spin or triggers the Win Streak and lands on three or more bonus symbols. Impatient players can speed things up and directly purchase the bonus (in markets where this is allowed) for a price of either 100x or 500x their stake.</p>
<p>The standard bonus buy provides players with six free spins, while the VIP bonus buy provides them with 15 and has a theoretical payout of 20,000x the initial bet.</p>
<p>At the start of the bonus round, players will be presented with a choice – they can either accept the current number of spins they’ve got or gamble for more spins. If their gamble is successful, players can continue gambling to multiply their spins even further. However, risk-takers should beware as failing a gamble terminates the bonus game instantly.</p>
<p>Once the Free Spins round starts, each next Free Spins symbol will remove the lowest paid symbol from the reels. In addition, it would also provide players with an extra spin.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Is Happy with the New Game</p>
<p>Stuart McCarthy, Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs, spoke about the newly-launched game. He said that his team was very excited about Cannonade!’s release and called it a “truly wonderful slot.” McCarthy noted that the game is packed full of lucrative features and is sure that players are going to have the time of their lives playing it.</p>
<p>There is plenty of loot to be won here, so don’t delay and step aboard the ship as we prepare to set sail! Struart McCarthy, Yggdrasil, head of product and programs</p>
<p>A week ago, Yggdrasil and Peter &amp; Sons released another slot called Dungeon Tower MultiMax.</p>
