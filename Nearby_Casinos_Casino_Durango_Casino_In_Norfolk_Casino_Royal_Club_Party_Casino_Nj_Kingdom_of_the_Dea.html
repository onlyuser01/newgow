<p>Kingdom of the Dead review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Kingdom of the Dead is an Ancient-Egyptian-themed slot from Pragmatic Play and Reel Kingdom. The two companies have worked together in the past to deliver hits like Big Bass Bonanza and Club Tropicana, and now they have turned their attention towards Egypt.</p>
<p>Like many Egyptian-themed titles, the game is based on an explorer's quest for gold and jewels inside an Egyptian temple.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Regular slot players will know what to expect from an Ancient-Egyptian-themed slot, and Kingdom of the Dead does very little to challenge the blueprint. The slot is set inside a lavish temple, with the reels of the game consisting of giant columns and the name of the slot shimmering across the top of the grid.</p>
<p>The reels' symbols are also fairly typical of the genre. The explorer is one of the higher-paying symbols, alongside a selection of Egyptian artefacts. The soundtrack is a generic Ancient-Egyptian-themed tune.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Kingdom of the Dead slot uses a conventional 5x3 set-up. It has 10 paylines that are active on every spin. Winning combinations are formed when players land three or more matching symbols across a payline.</p>
<p>The buttons for changing the stake are located on either side of the spin button, and the autoplay option is directly underneath.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>As its name might have hinted, Kingdom of the Dead is a slot with ‘Book of’ gameplay features and mechanics. Only, like its title, it puts a slight twist on them.</p>
<p>The Free Spins bonus is triggered when you land three or more Scatters. As it is in games like Book of Dead, the Scatter symbol here is a book. Landing three will reward ten free spins. Players will then get to choose between two ways of playing the round.</p>
<p>The first way is with a standard expanding symbol. A symbol is chosen at the start of the round and will expand whenever it lands. The other option is the Mystery Expanding Symbol. This is the same, only the symbol will change on every spin.</p>
<p>Player can choose which version of Free Spins wants to play out</p>
<p>During the round, landing three or more Scatters will trigger an additional ten spins. However, the Mystery Expanding Symbol will remain the same. An ante-bet feature is available depending on the player’s location.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The Kingdom of the Dead slot has a solid maths model. The game offers up wins of 10,000x the player’s stake and has an RTP of 96.07%, putting it around the industry average. The slot has been given a full 5/5 volatility rating from Pragmatic Play, which makes it optimal for our slot strategy.</p>
<p>The stake is adjusted by clicking the +/- buttons on either side of the spin icon. The minimum bet is £0.10, and the maximum is £325, giving this a very healthy betting range.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play and Reel Kingdom have delivered the goods with the Kingdom of the Dead slot. The game sticks closely to the established ‘Book of’ formula, but the addition of the Mystery Expanding Symbol helps to spice things up a little bit. On the whole, we are happy to recommend taking Kingdom of the Dead for a spin.</p>
