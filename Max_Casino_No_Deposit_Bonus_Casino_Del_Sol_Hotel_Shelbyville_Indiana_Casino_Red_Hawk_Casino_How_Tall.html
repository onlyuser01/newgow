    <h1>Max Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino Del Sol Hotel Shelbyville Indiana Casino Red Hawk Casino How Tall</h1>

<p>I suppose that's a collusion case, and I suppose everyone knows collusion is forbidden in all casinos without exception, I still think that would apply for someone playing against himself to abuse a bonus. While the casino is using a criminal activity clause to close the account, I'm not sure if that's actually the case because the amount is too small to be considered a money laundering attempt.</p>
<p>Still the player has a defense, if the other allegedly colluded player was playing from a different location, different casino, different connection and both used a different payment method not related to each other, the only possible proof to say they are colluded is by checking their gameplay and if they place the exact opposite bets with the exact same bet size, but that alone wouldn't be enough to prove they are colluded, since hundreds of players bet the same game at the same time it can happen that many players are playing with the same bet size and playing on opposites ends, what would be truly strange is that the allegedly colluded players had the exact same behavior when it comes to deposit and withdrawals patterns and if they don't play any other game where opposite betting is not possible (slots, gameshows, etc), and if the payment method is crypto then proving the collusion becomes hundreds times easier, as the casino only needs to conduct a chain analysis for the addresses used for deposits and withdrawals. This specific case is probably the most interesting one I have seen, it would be good to know the other player's view and the evidence the casino has, or knowing if the other player also got banned</p>
