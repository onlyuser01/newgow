<p>The 2023 SEC East champions Georgia Bulldogs are without a single loss in college football in almost exactly two years. Bookies think they’re going to prolong this run on December 2. They’re seen as five-point favorites against the champions of the SEC West, the Alabama Crimson Tide.</p>
<p>In this Georgia vs. Alabama preview, we’re going to explain why that’s the case. We’re also going to examine whether bookies are right to think of the Bulldogs as the favorites.</p>

<p>Georgia Bulldogs Going for Their 30th Straight Win</p>
<p>The No. 1 ranked team in the 2023 NCAAF is 12-0 this season, but their impressive run goes beyond this season. This team is on a 29-game winning streak, which started after the loss to the Alabama Crimson Tide in the 2021 SEC Championship game.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs got their revenge for that loss last year. They destroyed the Crimson Tide 33-18 in January 2022 in the CFB Playoff National Championship. Their defense was brilliant in that game, scoring two pick six TDs.</p>
<p>Their defense is at least as equally amazing in the 2023 NCAAF season. With 16.5 points conceded per game, they’re the 8th-best team in the nation.</p>
<p>Georgia’s offense is 8th in the nation, with 38.8 points per game. Quarterback Carson Beck has been doing alright in his first NCAAF season as a starter, throwing for 22 TDs in 12 games. The Bulldogs’ offense has also been dangerous running the ball, with running backs Daijun Edwards and Kendall Milton recording double-figure rushing TDs.</p>
<p>Alabama Crimson Tide</p>
<p>Alabama’s sophomore Jalen Milroe is in good shape right now, completing more than 65% of his passes in the last three games. In those games, we also saw him throw for eight TDs in total.</p>
<p>This play will be forgotten about, but not by me.</p>
<p>What a gutsy play by Jalen Milroe. This took everything in the tank. Everything. pic.twitter.com/ncjeV1CDhS — Austin Hannon (@austinhannon_) November 26, 2023</p>
<p>Thanks to his efforts, the Crimson Tide was able to beat the Auburn Tigers in the 2023 Iron Bowl last Saturday. The 20-year-old threw for a touchdown in the final minute of the game, which brought Alabama a win.</p>
<p>It was arguably his best performance since coming to Alabama, but he’ll have to do even better this time for the Crimson Tide to win the 2023 SEC Championship.</p>
<h1>8 Alabama Crimson Tide vs. #1 Georgia Bulldogs Prediction</h1>
<p>The Georgia Bulldogs are way better than the Alabama Crimson Tide so anything but a win for the No. 1 ranked team would be a surprise. But will we see them cover the spread in the 2023 SEC title game? We think we will. The thing is that the Alabama vs. Georgia game is played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, where the crown will be on the side of the Bulldogs.</p>
<p>Pick: Georgia Bulldogs -5.0 (-110)</p>
