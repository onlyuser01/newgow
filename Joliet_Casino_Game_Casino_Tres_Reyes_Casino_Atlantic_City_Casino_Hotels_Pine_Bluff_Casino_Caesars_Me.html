<p>Las Vegasâ€™ Caesars casino properties surprised slot players by extending $20 no deposit free spins bonuses to members of the Caesars Rewards program for wearing their face masks while playing online slots.</p>
<p>Caesars Rewards Mask Wearing Customers with a $20 Free Spins Bonus</p>
<p>There always is a middle ground. For Caesars Entertainment, the middle ground is rewarding good behavior with a slot bonus in Las Vegas. And if positive reinforcement works only this long, the $20 bonus by Caesars on The Las Vegas Strip seems to have done the trick.</p>
<p>Some patrons at several casino properties received freebies as they were playing at slot machines, reminiscent of the online casinos experience where players may often pick free spins without making a deposit. The Flamingo, Caesars Palace, and Paris all tweeted pictures of Caesarsâ€™ staff members handing over $20 in no deposit free spins to unwitting customers.</p>
<p>We're surprising some fabulous @Caesars_Rewards members who are helping keep our employees safe by wearing a mask with $20 in #FreePlay! ðŸ¤— Wear your mask and you could be a winner. ðŸ’– #4EverFabulous #VegasAgain pic.twitter.com/eULUBWpMiL â€” Flamingo Las Vegas (@FlamingoVegas) June 21, 2020</p>
<p>While the promotion didnâ€™t extend to everyone who entered the casino wearing a mask, Caesars still offered the incentives to quite a few people according to the ensuing Twitter comments. Based on tweets, the winners were picked randomly, although they all were Caesars Rewards members.</p>
<p>Some have riposted on social media, arguing that Caesarsâ€™ move wasnâ€™t as commendable as it looked at first blush. According to observers, Caesars should have just mandated that all patrons wear masks at all times rather than giving additional incentives to those who wore them.</p>
<p>Caesars, though, doesnâ€™t require slot players to wear masks. Only table players have to, although a change in regulation now obliges all casino visitors to don a mask before they enter a property and requires from casinos to be able to provide players with the necessary protective face coverings if they are lacking any.</p>
<p>To and Fro in Nevadaâ€™s COVID-19 Response and Casino Regulations</p>
<p>Originally shuttered back in mid-March, casinos have been slowly able to restart operations with gaming venues and eateries returning back to normal. Casinos reopened back on June 4, although there have been new reported COVID-19 cases with employees at five Las Vegas restaurants on and off The Las Vegas Strip tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the Eater Las Vegas reported.</p>
<p>The news has once again raised a red flag and cautioned optimists that Las Vegas may once again come to a complete standstill, something confirmed by Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak who said that he wouldnâ€™t risk the health of people.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) had to issue new safety and health recommendations adjusting to the quickly-changing situation and increase in total cases. On Friday, Gov. Sisolak appealed to the Medical Advisory Team to assess the situation and see if there could be introduced any enhanced measures to further the safety of measures.</p>
