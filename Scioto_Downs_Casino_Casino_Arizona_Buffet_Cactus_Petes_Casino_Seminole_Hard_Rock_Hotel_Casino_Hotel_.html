<p>Reflex Gaming an Yggdrasil have agreed on a new partnership that will see the pair bring innovative mechanics to the land-based sector in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The brands’ alliance focuses on the introduction of Game Engagement Mechanics (GEMs) which will be rolled out on the land-based market in the country. Reflex Gaming will tap into Yggdrasil’s GEMs and bring them to various retail venues across the UK, including betting shops, pubs, arcades, and other recreational venues.</p>
<p>Reflex Gaming is not a chance pick of a partner either, as Yggdrasil and the company have worked together under the YG Masters program since 2020. A total of 11 online titles under the program have been released with Reflex Gaming’s help, many of which had incorporated GEMs.</p>
<p>Some of the more prominent games the pair have worked on include Desperate Dawgs 2 and Dublin Up DoubleMax. Among the other games that Yggdrasil has developed to feature GEMs are Gigablox, Splitz, DoubleMax, WildFight, and DuoMax, to name a few. The new partnership is of particular importance as it allows Yggdrasil to expand its GEMs into the land-based sector.</p>
<p>The two partnerships enhanced and synergistic capabilities can significantly expand and boost the overall casino offer now brought forward by the two. Yggdrasil head of product &amp; programs Stuart McCarthy welcomed the opportunity and said that strengthening the partnership with Reflex Gaming to bring the GEMs into the land-based space was an important milestone for his company. He added:</p>
<p>We have already had great success together, releasing a number of high-performing online titles to players and we are thrilled to now take this to the retail sector. This deal is a testament to the strength of our GEMs and the potential it has to take the player experience to a new level. Yggdrasil head of product &amp; programs Stuart McCarthy</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly hailed by Reflex Gaming CPO Mat Ingram who said that Reflex was extremely pleased to now have the opportunity to bring GEMs to the land-based market in the retail market. It’s an opportunity to bring awareness for the YG Masters program, Reflex, and Yggdrasil’s own product offering, and generally help the companies embark on another successful collaboration across the board.</p>
<p>Ingram is confident that the success the two companies had under the YG Masters portfolio will now translate into the same solid performance for the land-based market as well.</p>
