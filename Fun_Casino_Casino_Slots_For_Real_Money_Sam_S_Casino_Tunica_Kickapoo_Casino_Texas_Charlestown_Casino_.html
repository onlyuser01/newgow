<p>Online gaming leader and inventor of the Megaways slot mechanic Big Time Gaming has revamped Danger High Voltage, an old-time classic from the early 2022s. The fresh release is called Danger High Voltage Megapays since it comes with the popular Megapays feature. The game gives players the chance to win a unique jackpot. It counts 4096 ways to win and offers a mesmerizing twist with special features like High Voltage Free Spins and Gates Of Hell Free Spins.</p>
<p>Danger High Voltage Megaways Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Back With a Bang</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming has returned with the iconic slot that was an electrifying hit game two decades ago, amping it up with its highly-acclaimed Megapays mechanic. Players who are familiar with the original game will be pleased to discover most of the classic game features and elements within the new slot. The list includes Electric Six smash hit songs, the 4096 pay lines, the hot bonus features, and the breathtaking multipliers.</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming’s chief executive officer Nik Robinson explained how the classic slot was improved by “adding the chance to win a life-changing amount of money.” He also described the game as “a beautiful nostalgia trip for anyone who remembers rocking out to the Electric Six in the 2000s”. Robinson added the game has an easy learning curve that matches all types of players, emphasizing that small bettors “will love the minimum 20p stake.” Relax Gaming’s chief executive officer Simon Hammon expressed delight for “debuting Danger High Voltage Megapays”, calling the original game “legendary”.</p>
<p>The fresh game is, therefore, back with a bang in the form of the Megapays mechanic. This is a worldwide global jackpot system that exclusively pertains to Relax Network. The progressive jackpot drops a lot more frequently compared to other jackpots. Every time a player makes a fresh bet, part of the Megapays jackpot gets added to it. Players can win any Megapays Jackpots while engaged in a random Megapays Feature. There is no minimum bet requirement to activate this feature.</p>
<p>Gates of Hell Free Spins Feature</p>
<p>The Gates of Hell Free Spins feature brings players seven Free Spins. During the spins, one of the symbols is revealed as the Sticky Wild for the remainder of the Free Spins round. The respective symbol then turns into a Sticky Wild on either the second, third, fourth, or fifth reels, substituting the rest of the symbols during the Free Spins. Coming across a minimum of four Sticky Wilds on the same reel rewards players with three more Free Spins.</p>
<p>High Voltage Free Spins</p>
<p>Players get 15 Free Spins for a chance to see the High Voltage Wild symbol pop on the second, third, fourth, or fifth reel. Once the symbol appears, it acts as a multiplier for adjacent wins between x11 and x66. Any Free Spin wins obtained with the High Voltage Wild are then multiplied by the multiplier. Landing at least three scatters while engaged in the High Voltage Free Spins feature brings players 15 Free Spins.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming, the casino games and platform supplier that distributes Big Time Gaming’s content, has announced it would add Peter &amp; Sons content to its aggregation platform.</p>
