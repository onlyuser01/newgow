<p>It’s now or never for Borussia Dortmund who just need to beat Mainz in the final round of the 2022-23 Bundesliga to win the first title in 11 years. Everything seems to be going in their favor, but the pressure might be too hard for this team to handle.</p>

<p>A Perfect Storm for Borussia Dortmund</p>
<p>On paper, Borussia Dortmund vs Mainz game looks like a game the boys in yellow are certain to win. Everything is going in BVB’s favor, starting from the fact that they’ve got motivation on their side. They’re two points ahead of Bayern Munich and this is the final round.</p>
<p>If the two finish on equal points, Bayern will win the title due to a better score differential. Assuming that Bayern won’t lose to Koln on Saturday, beating Mainz is a must for Borussia Dortmund.</p>
<p>Not only do they have motivation, but they will also have their fans at Westfalenstadion to cheer them on. Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund is their fortress where they’ve got all wins since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>Even if they didn’t have the willpower to win this game, they’d still be thought of as the favorites. Why? Because Dortmund’s roster is way, way better than the one of Mainz. Still, strange things have happened in the past, especially in high-pressure games. And this one will put a lot of pressure on the home team.</p>
<p>Mainz Players Don’t Really Care About Saturday’s Game (Or Do They?)</p>
<p>If Mainz loses to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, this team will not drop down in the Bundesliga standings. Instead, it will stay in the No. 9 place. Finishing somewhere in the middle of the table was their plan ahead of the 2022-23 season, so one can say that they can be satisfied with their performances in this campaign.</p>
<p>However, there’s one scenario in which Mainz would make its fans party throughout the weekend. If they beat Dortmund on Saturday, they could leapfrog Eintracht Frankfurt – their biggest rivals in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Still, such a thing remains very unlikely considering that Mainz players look completely out of shape, with four straight losses in the league.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund vs Mainz Prediction</p>
<p>If Borussia Dortmund didn’t win Saturday’s game, it would be one of the biggest upsets in the history of the Bundesliga. We have no doubts they’re going to pull it off, probably with a lot of goals in Mainz’s net.</p>
<p>Pick: Borussia Dortmund to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
