    <h1>New Casino In Vegas Juwa Casino Hard Rock Casino Tulsa Ok Saganing Casino Plus Casino Reevo Strikes</h1>

<p>Reevo is now expanding its impressive content library with the addition of Evolution, one of the leading iGaming brands in the live casino vertical, significantly strengthening the company’s reach in the segment.</p>
<p>Reevo Adds Evolution’s Brands to Its Aggregation Platform</p>
<p>The tie-up will cover the range of unique live casino solutions that Evolution has been developing over the past decades. The company is known for its outstanding products in the live dealer segment and has brought around many award-winning and excellent games such as the Lightning Live Casino games, the Monopoly Live and Deal Or No Deal Live Casino branded games.</p>
<p>Apart from the addition of the company’s live casino portfolio, Evolution will also deploy its slot content, which is possible through the NetEnt and Red Tiger studios. The company acquired NetEnt, which owned Red Tiger, in 2020, and now leverages both its own live casino product and the acquired brands’ massive slot portfolio.</p>
<p>Evolution’s slot games feature some exclusive titles such as Gonzo’s Quest, Starburst, Knights of Avalon, and Lost Relics. The company also has rights to the innovative Megaways slots game mechanic, which is licensed by Big Time Gaming, making for a very strong content injection into the REEVO aggregation platform. Big Time Gaming was acquired by Evolution on April 12, 2021, for a sum total of €450 million (ca $534 million).</p>
<p>Moving forward, Reevo partner operators will be able to use a single API integration to benefit from Evolution’s extensive library of featured, live, and branded games, making for a straightforward onboarding and plenty of variety to enjoy on the go.</p>
<p>Scaling Reevo’s Content Library with the Best Suppliers</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Reevo head of sales Petra Maria Poola said that the company was extremely pleased to be onboarding what is clearly a best-in-class supplier, with many more opportunities to follow. She said that partner operators will get access to some incredible content and spoke about the opportunities ahead:</p>
<p>We are all huge fans so we’re thrilled to have Evolution join us in providing the industry’s leading content aggregation offering, providing rapid market access and instant revenues. Reevo head of sales Petra Maria Poola</p>
<p>Reevo is also confident that this signing is just a start as both companies are determined to continue scaling their offer in future. More Evolution will be added to Reevo’s platform in the coming months. Reevo has been significantly scaling up its list of partner operators and providers of iGaming solutions, including the recent tie-ups with Booming Games, Pragmatic Play, and not least Livespins.</p>
