<p>DraftKings collaborates with hip-hop artists to release an NBA playoffs anthem called "The Game," tapping into the culture of the sport</p>
<p>Hip-hop icons Rick Ross, Fat Joe, and The LOX have released a new track titled “The Game” just in time for the NBA playoffs. The track, sponsored by DraftKings, is a celebration of basketball culture, incorporating themes of competition and lifestyle elements.</p>
<p>DraftKings Releases NBA Playoffs Anthem to Connect with Basketball Fans</p>
<p>Major sportsbook DraftKings collaborated with the artists to create an NBA playoffs anthem that taps into the culture of the sport. Set Free Richardson, Buda &amp; Grandz, and Mike Kuz are credited with the production of the track, along with DraftKings. The company has been making efforts to get involved with the basketball fan community by creating original content centred around the NBA, music, art, gaming, and sports betting.</p>
<p>DraftKings Co-Founder and President of DraftKings North America, Matt Kalish, said, “To share our love for the game, DraftKings collaborated with hip-hop artists to release an NBA Playoffs anthem. ‘The Game’ is a track that taps into hoops culture on and off the court, and what it means to bet on yourself.”</p>
<p>The song is available on all major streaming platforms and can be found at the DraftKings website.</p>
<p>NBA Culture Icons Team Up with DraftKings</p>
<p>It’s no shock that this collaboration involves some big names in the NBA culture scene who have been breaking ground for a considerable period. Set Free Richardson and the other members of the Starting Five at the Compound caught the attention of the media a few months back with an unexpected release of the Air Jordan 11 Varsity Reds.</p>
<p>During commercial breaks of ESPN’s Play-In telecasts and other programming, viewers can anticipate hearing “The Game.” However, this is merely a single element of the bigger picture as basketball culture expands and grows more influential within the game. DraftKings has vowed to provide innovative material and contributions in novel areas to stimulate discussion regarding the sport.</p>
<p>DraftKings Expanding Sports Betting Offerings Beyond NBA</p>
<p>NBA is not the only focus for DraftKings. The company is trying to gain new ground in other sports as well. Just last week DraftKings requested permission to offer sports betting markets on the Boston Marathon. If approved, DraftKings plans to focus on professional athletes, covering only the top 20 men and women participants. The sports betting markets available will be totals and outright winners. Other states such as Wyoming, Kansas, and Oregon have already given the green light to operate sports betting markets on the event.</p>
<p>At the end of March, DraftKings also entered a new agreement with casino games provider, High 5 Games, to power its operations in Ontario, Canada, with content. The deal deepens the relationship between the two companies, which already have an existing agreement in several US states.In other news, DraftKings CEO, Jason Robins, took to Twitter to discuss the company’s recent successes and future predictions, acknowledging challenges and touting the company’s cost-cutting measures and revenue increases.</p>
