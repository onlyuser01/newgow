    <h1>Online Casino Usa No Deposit Bonus Hialeah Casino Ameristar Casino East Chicago Casino In Durant Fin</h1>

<p>I don't play with bonuses ever. I used my own money. This casino never asked for verification documents even with my first 2 withdrawals of 650 each. I messaged with 2 or 3 different people. All asking for screenshot. I explained to each one of them I didn't take one because I was in shock of such a huge win and signed out of the Game to check my balance. They said to check my statistics, which I did and every time I checked it was all zeros which was impossible because I had small wings within that 1 minute of play. They said maybe it was on the provider's side but they couldn't see a bet with that amount of a win. I asked if they kept a record of everyone's bets and wins and they said it would s show in my account, I screenshot part of the long list and sent it to them and here when I filed my complaint. They said they only saw the win of $1067. 75000 does not equal to 1067. I have the full list of times, bets and wins from that morning I played but I don't understand all those numbers and they said they would check the number corresponding to that win. I'm getting screwed, all I can say. Whether this gets solved for good or bad, I know what I saw on my screen and at least the provider should have a record of every play. They gave me 750 euros instead of what I actually won. After my 2 MASSIVE WINS IT SAID 75 000. 3 ZEROS, NOT ONE!</p>
