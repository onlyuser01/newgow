    <h1>Route 66 Casino Hotel Kickapoo Lucky Casino Free Online Casino Bonus Jamul Casino Hard Rock Casino C</h1>

<p>On 27.01.2021 I played a bonus and the amount after wagering in the account is 1100 EUR. In principle, the casino pays out the winnings at the moment, but this time it did not happen. After a long communication with their live support, they asked me for documents (about 10) for verification and I sent them the same day, as the support did not approve some of them and I did them again while they told me that everything was fine. The support explained to me that according to their rules, the inspection is between 3 and 14 working days (which in my opinion is an extremely long time). Now on 12.02 they sent me the following message:</p>
<p>Hello. In order to proceed with verification we kindly ask you to provide us better quality screenshots from your Skrill and Ecopayz and please also provide us photos of the * 9590 card. Thank you!</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it here anymore ... They want better quality of the screenshots from Skrill and Ecopayz .... The screenshots were made on a computer with the automatic camera (I personally haven't heard of better quality of the photos than that) ... I sent them the photos again and now they want me to wait again from 3 to 14 working days, which for me is a play and a refusal to pay me the winnings</p>
