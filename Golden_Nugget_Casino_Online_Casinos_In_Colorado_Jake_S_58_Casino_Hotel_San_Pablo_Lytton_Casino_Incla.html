<p>It took two years and a couple of bad beat, but Daniel Negreanu has finally picked up another major poker tournament victory. The Canadian poker pro and six-time WSOP winner shipped the $300K Super High Roller Bowl (SHRB) for $3.3 million.</p>

<p>Friday’s action played down to a final table that was going to leave one person unhappy. There were five players left, and only four could end in the money.</p>
<p>In the end, the hated role of bubble man fell to Orpen Kisacikoglu, who started the final table action as the short stack. Taking him out was Andrew Lichtenberger, with Q-Q vs A-Q and a smooth board. From there, “DNegs” Negreanu knew he had a real shot at the title.</p>
<p>The Chips Begin To Fall</p>
<p>Justin Bonomo, who took down Negreanu when they met in the final heads-up battle in the same event in 2018, came out in turn at the hands of Lichtenberger. His 8-8 wasn’t enough to compete against J-J after the board ran out.</p>
<p>Bonomo missed the top prize, but he collected $720,000. That was enough to push him to the top of the All-Time Money List with $57.7 million, according to Hendon Mob.</p>
<p>Lichtenberger, “Luckychewy,” wasn’t so lucky as the game progressed. He fell and ended up as the short stack. Then, he hit the rail after Negreanu dominated him with A-6 over K-6. The US pro added $1.15 million to his $13 million in live tournament winnings as he shook hands and left the table.</p>
<p>YO @RadioAmanda I DID IT!!!! I love you soooo much. Thanks for being there for me always through the rough patch last couple years. You always believed in me and it makes a difference! ❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/TL176UW6mh — Daniel Negreanu (@RealKidPoker) October 8, 2022</p>
<p>This left only two – Petrangelo and Negreanu. Heads-up starts very unbalanced, as “Kid Poker” Negreanu had a sizable chip lead. He was sitting on a stack of around six million, while Petrangelo only had about 1.3 million.</p>
<p>The inertia of the match never really seems to change in the first half-hour of play. Negreanu was on a mission – he was determined to break his two-year losing streak. Methodically, he chipped away at his opponent’s stack, wearing Petrangelo down.</p>
<p>With an overwhelming lead, Negreanu shoved all-in with Q-7. Petrangelo had no choice but to call, hoping his K-5 would find a match on the board. There was no help coming, though, and he would have to settle for $2.01 million and a second-place finish.</p>
<p>The Hand Heard’ Round The World</p>
<p>Negreanu scored a monster hand earlier in the 24-player tourney that turned the tides, and it couldn’t have happened against a better opponent.</p>
<p>Kid Poker, who lost over $1 million during this year’s WSOP, suffered a bad beat at the Poker Masters $50K event. His pocket Aces fell to pocket Jacks after Seth Davies picked up trips on the turn. Undeterred, he immediately began preparing for the next event.</p>
<p>It paid off, and he got his revenge on the bad beat from the previous event. Facing alleged poker cheat Bryn Kenney early on, he defended his position with a weak 3-3, not knowing that Kenney was sitting on pocket Aces.</p>
<p>Kenney led off under the gun with a 5K bet, to which Negreanu responded in kind. When the flop revealed A-5-4, Kenney had to appreciate his trip Aces. However, Kid Poker was also looking at a possible straight. After he checked, Kenney threw out another 5K in chips and Negreanu called.</p>
<p>The turn became the turning point. A 3 gave Negreanu trips and hope. He obviously didn’t know that Kenney was also sitting on a set, so he threw out 10K in chips, with Kenney following right behind.</p>
<p>The river gave Negreanu the only card that would keep him from defeat. He would have likely made a run on the pot holding a set of 3s, which would have fallen against Kenney’s trip Aces. However, a 3 on the river gave Kid Poker quads.</p>
<p>Negreanu put out 25K of his chips, with Kenney raising to 105K, confident his Aces-high boat was unbeatable. Kid Poker shoved, Kenney responded, and they revealed their cards. Kenney could only walk away, while Negreanu gained a lot more confidence to carry him through to victory.</p>
