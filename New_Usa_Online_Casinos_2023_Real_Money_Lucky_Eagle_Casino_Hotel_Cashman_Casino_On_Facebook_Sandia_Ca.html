    <h1>New Usa Online Casinos 2023 Real Money Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel Cashman Casino On Facebook Sandia Ca</h1>

<p>The culprit would stream on TikTok and wager on whichever machine his subscribers requested, a local news outlet reports</p>
<p>Blake Carl Fitzgerald faces prison after running an illegal gambling scheme. The 40-year-old allegedly used livestreaming services to wager remotely on behalf of other people.</p>
<p>The Minnesota man ran his illegal scheme on TikTok and Discord, Bring Me the News, a local news outlet, claims. According to a criminal complaint, Fitzgerald ran the scheme between October and December 2022.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald allegedly received $65,103 through CashApp and Venmo from his customers. He proceeded to use the money to play slot games at Lake Casino &amp; Resort and Treasure Island Casino, livestreaming his performance on TikTok. According to the complaint, Fitzgerald would call out a subscriber’s name during the stream, asking them to say which machine they’d like him to play.</p>
<p>As agreed with his subscribers, Fitzgerald would keep more than half of the winnings and would send his subscribers the rest. If he ran out of time to play, he would return his subscribers’ money.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald took a subscription fee of $5.99 from his followers. He kept in touch with them via a Discord server.</p>
<p>Minnesota, meanwhile, continues to fight for the legalization of sports betting.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald Faces Prison Time</p>
<p>Fitzgerald’s scheme eventually fell apart when the Minnesota Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement Division received an anonymous complaint. After that, the regulatory body launched an investigation and identified Fitzgerald. The authorities also learned that the man had an accomplice who helped him run the scheme.</p>
<p>However, the name of the suspect has not been revealed as of yet since they are yet to be formally charged. In the meantime, Fitzgerald is being charged with three counts of running an illegal gambling operation.</p>
<p>As a result, the mastermind behind the illegal TikTok gambling scheme risks prison time of up to three years, as well as thousands of dollars in fines, Bring Me the News concluded.</p>
