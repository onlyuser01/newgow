    <h1>Casino In Cincinnati Ohio Seminole Classic Casino Hollywood Downstream Casino Resort Hotel Boston Bi</h1>

<p>Bad case of rip-off with players who unfortunately had a second forgotten account, which was opened as a substitute, like mine, because the login with the other email didn't work. Where at that time it turned out that it was probably a technical problem. At least I didn't delete it then. So after the verification, which worked great, I was recognized as an official player. Except for tag x..... I noticed a transposed digit in the phone number. I asked customer service to change it, who forwarded it to administration. And the game went on. This so-called administration blocked both accounts at once and I no longer had access to my won money of 800 euros .</p>
<p>After several attempts to speak to customer service, this was only accompanied by excerpts from the general terms and conditions. You can't really have a conversation with them anymore. This morning I received an email from the complaints department, it was against Glubrecht and it wasn't a mistake on my part or on their part. But they would open my account out of goodwill, but without the profits!!! A return email to them was that the deposits should remain with me. These were already 300 euros! But there was no response. According to an online gambling lawyer, such general terms and conditions are not legal and violate the gambling law. But I insist on my money. Unfortunately, I can't provide any receipts at all because I'm blocked from my account and access. I'm also assuming that this was deleted even with a reactivation!</p>
