<p>Digitain, a global leader in the provision of award-winning sports betting and gaming platform technology, has added a true sports star to its ambassador team. The renowned soccer legend Luís Figo will be joining the company as a brand ambassador.</p>
<p>Figo Is a Legend in Soccer</p>
<p>This is a historic moment for Digitain because Figo is acclaimed as one of the most famous Portuguese players in the world. He was among the top players during his prime and played for some of the best-known teams in the world. Figo served as a winger under the banner of Barcelona, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, to name a few.</p>
<p>Not only did Figo play for some of the powerhouses in soccer, but he also won numerous trophies during his career. Some of his most notable feats include a UEFA Cup Winner’s Cup, a UEFA Champions League title, four Series A titles and four La Liga titles. In addition, he was named FIFA World Player for 2001 and received the Ballon d’OR in 2000.</p>
<p>Figo’s feats and the popularity of his name make him a perfect partner for Digitain, which remains ambitious in maintaining its leadership position in iGaming.</p>
<p>Figo and Digitain Are Looking Forward to Working Together</p>
<p>Vardges Vardanyan, founder of Digitain Group, spoke on the matter. He said he feels “an immense thrill” to welcome a player as distinguished as Figo to the Digitain family. Furthermore, Vardanyan lauded Figo for his unequaled reputation, impressive background and winning attitude. Because of those qualities, Vardanyan is happy to have the soccer legend represent Digitain and its offerings.</p>
<p>Figo is undoubtedly the perfect choice to symbolize our Sportsbook’s quality, innovation and effectiveness. We’re really keen to work with this sports icon Vardges Vardanyan, founder, Digitain Group</p>
<p>Figo also shared his thoughts on teaming up with the iGaming leader. He admitted that joining Digitain is an honor and that he is looking forward to representing the brand.</p>
<p>This is a long-standing and forward-thinking iGaming company, dedicated to offering a broad variety of successful iGaming solutions to partners all over the world. Becoming their Brand Ambassador was an easy decision. Luís Figo, brand ambassador, Digitain Group</p>
<p>On a separate note, Digitain recently reinforced its leadership team with several new key additions. Three weeks ago, Digitain named Peter Nolan as its new R&amp;D director. In March, the company appointed Jason Marcelino as the commercial director for Digitain’s freshly developed live casino division.</p>
