<p>Argentina’s online gambling sector has taken off with Vibra Gaming becoming the first developer that received an approval by the Lottery of the City of Buenos Aires to provide its products to online casino operators.</p>
<p>At Least Twelve Companies Are Expected to Receive Approval Soon</p>
<p>Yesterday, Argentine game and platform developer Vibra Gaming announced that it has received approval by the Lottery of the City of Buenos Aires (LOTBA) to distribute its contents through online casino operations.</p>
<p>Vibra Gaming is one of the most recent companies to enter LatAm’s online casino software market and with its rapidly growing portfolio of online casinos and games, it is set to become a major competitor in the industry in the next few years. Vibra Gaming provides localized content and technology to land-based operators launching their online initiatives.</p>
<p>Vibra’s RNG (Random Number Generator) has passed the checks carried out by GLI (Gaming Laboratories International), which is the entity providing testing and certification services to the gaming industry worldwide, assuring that this vital component of the content distribution platform (RGS) is secure.</p>
<p>The news follows LOTBA’s recent announcement about its intentions to have ”the first active platforms” for online gaming during the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>In November, Sebastián Vivot, manager of Modernization and Information Technologies at LOTBA, participated in the SAGSE Talks, the most important online networking event for the LatAm region, which gathers leaders from the online gaming industry. During the event, Vivot said that twelve companies were already in the process of obtaining permits to operate in the online gambling segment.</p>
<p>“We are so proud of this achievement, not only for having obtained the certification but also for becoming the first content developer from Argentina to do so. The approval process has been completely effective and successful thanks to the help of the Lottery of the City of Buenos Aires.” Ramiro Atucha, CEO of Vibra Gaming</p>
<p>LOTBA analyzes the technical standard of companies, their projects, responsible gaming matters, money laundering issues, as well as the patrimonial, commercial and legal background of the candidates, Vivot said at SAGSE Talks.</p>
<p>LOTBA to Offer its Own Products Through Online Channels</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation and growing online gambling market, which was already a global trend in the previous years. In September 2020, the Legislative Council of the City of Buenos Aires amended the existing law to allow land-based operators to apply for online gambling licenses.</p>
<p>Vivot revealed that apart from the approval process of online operators, LOTBA is also working on other projects, which include the marketing through online channels of its own products, such as the lottery games Quiniela of the City of Buenos Aires and Loto, among others.</p>
