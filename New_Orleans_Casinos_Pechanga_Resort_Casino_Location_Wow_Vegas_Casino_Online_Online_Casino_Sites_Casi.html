<p>Three Golf Majors Rescheduled, Masters Set for November, Open Championship Canceled</p>

<p>The 2020 Masters, originally set for this week at Augusta National in Georgia, will be held November 9-15. It’s one of three golf majors being postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Golf’s officiating bodies, including the R&amp;A, USGA, PGA Tour, PGA of America, Augusta National Golf Club, LPGA Tour, and European Tour, released revised schedules Monday. The most important announcements were in regards to the 2020 majors.</p>
<p>Original Date New Date</p>
<p>Masters April 6-12 November 9-15</p>
<p>PGA Championship May 11-17 August 3-9</p>
<p>US Open June 15-21 September 14-20</p>
<p>Open Championship July 12-19 Canceled</p>
<p>“In recent weeks, the global golf community has come together to collectively put forward a calendar of events that will, we hope, serve to entertain and inspire golf fans around the world. We are grateful to our respective partners, sponsors, and players who have allowed us to make decisions – some of them, very tough decisions – in order to move the game and the industry forward,” read a joint statement from the golf bodies.</p>
<p>The release added, “This is a difficult and challenging time for everyone coping with the effects of this pandemic. We remain very mindful of the obstacles ahead, and each organization will continue to follow the guidance of the leading public health authorities, conducting competitions only if it is safe and responsible to do so.”</p>
<p>Across the Board Favorite</p>
<p>World No. 1 Rory McIlroy is the betting favorite for all three of the majors, which will be held within a span of just 101 days. A player who gets hot for a three-month span could essentially overhaul his career.</p>
<p>But for now, McIlroy has the shortest odds for the Masters (8/1), PGA Championship (10/1), and US Open (8/1). A win in November would cap off the career grand slam for the Northern Irishman.</p>
<p>As for Augusta in November, following McIlroy is Jon Rahm (12/1), Brooks Koepka (14/1), and then defending champion Tiger Woods and Justin Thomas at 16/1.</p>
<p>Up first is the PGA. After McIlroy, it’s Rahm at 12/1, and then rounding out the top five is Koepka, Thomas, and Dustin Johnson at 14/1.</p>
<p>Open Closed</p>
<p>Golf’s oldest major won’t take place for the first time since 1945, when the tournament was canceled because of World War II. The R&amp;A says it considered every possible date to hold The Open Championship, but “based on guidance from the UK Government, the health authorities, public services, and The R&amp;A’s advisers,” there was no reasonable solution.</p>
<p>I can assure everyone that we have explored every option for playing The Open this year, but it is not going to be possible,” said R&amp;A Chief Executive Martin Slumbers.</p>
<p>The next time the Claret Jug will be awarded is now scheduled to take place July 11-18 at Royal St. George’s – the same venue that was to host the 2020 championship. St. Andrews, which was to host the 2021 tournament, will now host in 2022.</p>
