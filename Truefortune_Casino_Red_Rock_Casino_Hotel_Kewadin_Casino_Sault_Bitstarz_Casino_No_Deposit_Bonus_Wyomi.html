<p>Cash Truck review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Cash Truck is themed around a post-apocalyptic heist.</p>
<p>Players will speed into Mad Max-style road chase across a dusty desert. With a ragtag crew of eccentric characters, they’ll do what they have to in order to steal as much cash as they can off the back of the truck.</p>
<p>This game has a diesel-punk vibe that fans of post-apocalyptic narratives will love.</p>
<p>Big win in the Cash Truck slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The ominous soundtrack adds tension with an ‘80s synthwave flavor. The reels spin with a metallic clicking that brings to mind the cocking of a gun, making it clear the stakes high.</p>
<p>The rugged characters on the reels include a crazed villain in a metal mask, a savvy green-haired girl, and a mysterious hooded man with an eyepatch.</p>
<p>Also among the symbols are the four card suits, crudely painted on bottle caps, as well as a variety of weapons and survival gear.</p>
<p>The reels spin in front of a truck filled with dirty cash, emphasizing that these characters are on the run after an especially profitable heist.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, players will see desolate landscape with canyons in the distance. The road disappears beneath the trunk ahead, adding drama to the moment.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack make for a gritty and exciting atmosphere that will have players feeling like heroes (or villains) in a dark future world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Cash Truck has a 5x7 total reel grid area. However, part of this grid will be locked until players land winning combinations that unlock three positions at random.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going to the rightmost.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that symbols that are part of winning combinations will disappear so that new symbols can fall into their place.</p>
<p>Players can buy directly into the Free Spins feature if they choose.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Second Chance feature is triggered when players land 2 Bonus Scatter symbols in the unlocked region of the reels. During this feature, the reels are cleared of any symbols that are not Bonus Scatter symbols, and the player gets one free respin in which to land a third Scatter.</p>
<p>When players do land at least 3 Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature begins, starting with 3 free spins. Everytime the player hits, the spin counter resets to three. Players begin the feature with an Expanding symbol for every additional Bonus Scatter landed.</p>
<p>Players start the Free Spins feature with 3 Cash Stack symbols in randomly selected positions. During the feature, all symbols show values in multiples of the base bet of the game.</p>
