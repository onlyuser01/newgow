<p>Red Hot BBQ review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Red Hot BBQ is a barbeque-themed slot game from the team at Red Tiger Gaming. Players spin reels populated by a selection of grilled vegetables, with no real plot driving the action.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The Red Hot BBQ slot is well-presented, with the slot’s action taking place on a set of reels fashioned to look like a BBQ. The heat of the coals adds a warm glow to the grid, with smoke subtly rising from the side of the BBQ.</p>
<p>The game switches settings when you move to the bonus rounds, and some animations are used to keep the action moving. Ultimately, Red Hot BBQ has a solid but fairly forgettable theme and design.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Red Hot BBQ doesn’t turn up the heat too much with the base game. The slot uses five reels, each displaying three symbols. This allows for 20 active paylines on every spin.</p>
<p>You will find all of the standard gameplay control in the panel under the reels, with turbo and autospin options available. There is also a Buy Feature that may not be available in all locations.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Red Tiger has kept things quite basic with the Red Hot BBQ bonus features, with a mix of free spins and mystery symbols dominating the gameplay.</p>
<p>The first bonus you will probably encounter is the Mystery Sauce symbols. These are mystery symbols that will reveal themselves to be matching and will only reveal the higher-paying symbols.</p>
<p>The main bonus is the Red Hot BBQ Free Spins round. This launches whenever players land three or more Scatters. Three, four, or five Scatters launch nine, 12 or 15 spins, respectively. During the round, a meter known as the Hot Bar is displayed above the reels. It displays the five higher-paying symbols.</p>
<p>Each time the next symbol on the bar lands with a Chilli next to it, it is collected on the meter. When you land three, the symbol is upgraded on the grid, and you will start collecting the next symbol along. The first two stages reward two additional spins, with the third and fourth awarding three and the fifth rewarding five. If you fill the entire meter, the Ghost Pepper symbol appears on the grid.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Red Hot BBQ has a maximum win of 1,100x your stake, which is fairly disappointing for a Red Tiger slot. The RTP is also low, coming in below average at 95.66%. The slot is considered medium volatility. Unfortunately, none of these factors are what we recommend pursuing in our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>The game allows for minimum bets of $0.20 and a maximum of $80, giving the game a fairly healthy betting range.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Red Tiger Gaming fails to really get the BBQ burning with the Red Hot BBQ slot. A lack of original or interesting features, combined with a low maximum win and RTP, means that this is far from the developer’s best work.</p>
