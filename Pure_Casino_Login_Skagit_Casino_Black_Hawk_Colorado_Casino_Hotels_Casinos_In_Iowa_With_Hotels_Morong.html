<p>Future Anthem, a leading market data and AI specialist, has unveiled a significant expansion of its workforce. As announced, the company’s team has more than doubled since its Series A funding round in July 2022.</p>
<p>In just a year, Future Anthem went from a team of 21 members to a workforce of 43 members. The bigger team will improve the company’s pipeline while reinforcing the products it provides to its operator and supplier partners.</p>
<p>For reference, Future Anthem has existing relationships with multiple companies in the gaming and betting sector, including powerhouses such as Betway, Churchill Downs, Gaming Realms, Ladbrokes Coral and William Hill, among others.</p>
<p>Poised for further growth, the company’s team is now comprised of multiple experienced professionals who will leverage their knowledge to deliver personalized player experiences to its partnering companies. According to the company, data science experts currently make up more than two-thirds of its team.</p>
<p>The Company Sports a Diverse Team</p>
<p>Future Anthem has been tapping into fresh talent as it scouted for graduates from UK’s top universities to use as interns. According to the company, seven of its current full-time employees kicked off their time with the company as interns.</p>
<p>The data and tech specialist has also been checking out experienced employees with a track record in the gambling industry. For example, the company recently welcomed IGT’s former worker Ann-Kathrin Baumgardt as VP of sales and customer development for the EMEA region.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Future Anthem’s team is currently comprised of people from 16 different nationalities. The data powerhouse also boasts an impressive gender ratio of 60% male to 40% female workers.</p>
<p>Finally, the company noted that it recently opened a new office in Shoreditch to accommodate its multiple new members.</p>
<p>Future Anthem Is Excited to Grow Its Team and Business</p>
<p>Future Anthem’s head of people, Emma Ferguson, commented on the matter, saying that the company is proud to welcome so many experts who “possess exceptional technical abilities” and “deep insights into the specific dynamics” of the betting and gaming sectors.</p>
<p>Ferguson added that the company’s diverse workforce will allow Future Anthem to develop unprecedented AI products that leave a mark.</p>
<p>By harnessing the knowledge and expertise of our diverse workforce, we are well-positioned to develop AI products that address the evolving needs of our clients and drive transformative change within the industry. Emma Ferguson, head of people, Future Anthem</p>
<p>As a result of its expanded team, Future Anthem has bolstered its award-winning Amplifier AI product. Speaking of Amplifier AI, the solution was adopted by EveryMatrix three months ago.</p>
