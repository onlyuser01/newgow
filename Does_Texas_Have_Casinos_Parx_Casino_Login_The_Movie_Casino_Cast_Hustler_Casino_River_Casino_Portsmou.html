    <h1>Does Texas Have Casinos Parx Casino Login The Movie Casino Cast Hustler Casino River Casino Portsmou</h1>

<p>Hand of Luck. One of these not on gamstop casinos, same setup, games, same auto messages as many others, PlentyofFish,FishyWins,MidnightWins etc</p>
<p>My choice to play of course, and i enjoy the games, and sometimes so nice bonuses. Part of the fun.</p>
<p>Hence, when i win, a delay with withdrawal process, so, naturally, i spend the winnings, so never actually withdrawing ( my choice ).</p>
<p>But not this time. This time, i do want my winnings, 800euros in fact.</p>
<p>Clicked withdraw, speedy email replies back ( same with setup, cant fault them for that ). BUT, a good few hours later, the " sorry, for technical reasons, cant put it on your mastercard " ( same card which i initally deposited onto ), tried again, again speedy emails reply, 'we are an honest company..we want to help you...' etc tried 4x or more over series of days</p>
<p>...and then the email to say, no point trying again on this card as it wont work. ( I did my bank, they were none the wiser, and say would be no issues at all re money coming in ) .</p>
<p>Hand of Luck asked me to try another mastercard ( i dont have one ), try, Metrobank ( no! i dont want to setup a bank!! ) , try bitcoin ( i did try this, reluncantly because i dont want bitcoin,</p>
<p>I tried bitcoin, got some advice from some forums, said, sounded 'not right' what they were asking. Some address lines etc, didnt work.</p>
<p>Their Help replies and their emails are quick, and initially appear 'helpful'...but end of the day....they are not paying out, giving me false hope, telling me to try other methods. Who can i complain to?</p>
