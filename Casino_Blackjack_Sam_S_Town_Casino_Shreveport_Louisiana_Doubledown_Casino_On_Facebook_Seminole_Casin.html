<p>Unibet, Kindred Group’s returning sportsbook, has launched a new initiative in the Dutch betting market called Unibet Impact. The idea behind this program is to champion, promote and uphold safe and responsible gambling practices, with a side dish of addressing sports manipulation and corruption.</p>
<p>Kindred Group Announces the Unibet Impact</p>
<p>The program is fully-aimed at investing in projects that focus their efforts on improving safety and responsibility in the gambling sector. To achieve the goals set by the program, Unibet set out to work on three pillars.</p>
<p>These pillars include a partnership with the European Football for Development Network, a charity tournament with Telstar and De Graafschap, and an additional collaboration with amateur sports.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, Unibet has become the official partner for EFDN in the country and will ensure that it champions the best safe gambling practices. Of course, not everyone is happy with the recent expansion of Unibet’s presence in the country.</p>
<p>For one, some have called the partnership between Ajax FC and Unibet regrettable, but Unibet is determined to prove detractors wrong. Unibet Netherlands general manager Lennart Kessels welcomed the partnership and said that Unibet has every intention to protect the gaming sector and actively contribute towards tackling sports fraud, match-fixing, and more.</p>
<p>Overall, Kindred Group wants to be more involved in the country’s sports. To ensure that it can carry out its responsibility pillars, Unibet has at the same time signed partnerships with the aforementioned partners from Telstar and Graafschap. Unibet is going to work with Simon Kistemaker to host the tournament.</p>
<p>Amateur Sports and Additional Exposure</p>
<p>The brand is also committed to supporting amateur sports and will offer sponsorships to 50 teams this season. Teams who apply will receive branded shirts, socks, shorts, and kit bags, which is part of Unibet’s positive brand reinforcement across the Netherlands. Unibet has been rapidly expanding across the regulated gaming market in the country. It entered in June after having to withdraw previously as the market was being re-regulated.</p>
