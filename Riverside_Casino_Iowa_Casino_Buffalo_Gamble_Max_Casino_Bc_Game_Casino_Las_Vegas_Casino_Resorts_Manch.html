<p>The Manchester City vs. Tottenham game on Sunday, December 3, is arguably the most interesting Premier League matchup of the coming weekend</p>
<p>There are several reasons why Manchester City vs. Tottenham is one of the most interesting Premier League games of the weekend. First of all, this is a must-win game for Man City who wish to get back to the No. 1 position in the Prem ASAP.</p>
<p>The Spurs, on the other hand, are desperate to end their losing streak in the Premier League. They lost their last three games, which is too much for a team that, not too long ago, had title ambitions.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs. Tottenham Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Manchester City -333 Draw +500 Tottenham +750</p>

<p>Manchester City Going All-In at Etihad Stadium</p>
<p>Manchester City is 9-2-2 in the 2023-24 Premier League, with two draws in a row. Those happened against Chelsea (4-4) and Liverpool (1-1), so it’s nothing to be ashamed of. However, not winning those two games resulted in dropping out of the No. 1 spot in the EPL table.</p>
<p>Arsenal leapfrogged Pep Guardiola’s men and is now ahead by one point. To stay in the race for the title, the Cityzens need to get back onto the winning track. Luckily for them, the game with Tottenham is played on their turf.</p>
<p>At Etihad Stadium, they’re without a single loss in the last 30 competitive matches in all competitions. They also have a very good record at home against the Spurs, winning seven of their last ten duels at Etihad.</p>
<p>Can Tottenham Shock the Oddsmakers?</p>
<p>The Tottenham Hotspur are seen as huge underdogs ahead of their trip to Manchester. It’s not only because of their disappointing history with this opponent; it’s also because the Spurs are in poor form.</p>
<p>They lost their last three Premier League games, even though they played against teams which, at the time, were below them in the standings – Chelsea, Wolves, and Aston Villa.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons behind this is that they were horrible defensively in those games. They conceded eight goals in those three matches, which is almost half of all the goals they’ve allowed in the 2023-24 Premier League.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s almost certain that coach Ange Postecoglou has worked hard with his boys to patch up the holes in the defense, but it’s a big question over whether that will hold up against Man City.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs. Tottenham Prediction</p>
<p>Manchester City is probably the best team in the world right now. That said, the Cityzens can beat any opponent. This goes especially when it comes to the games played on their turf. At home, they’re practically unbeatable and this time, they’ll be super-motivated to win as they’re hungry for points.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
