<p>Evolution Group and Sky Betting &amp; Gaming have signed a new agreement that will see the former provide its live casino services to the Flutter company in the United Kingdom. As a result, Evolution will deploy its live casino products across Sky Betting &amp; Gaming’s brands.</p>
<p>This way, Evolution will consolidate the partner’s foothold in the vertical through the addition of cutting-edge visuals, uninterrupted 24/7 live experience, and a strong product variety. Evolution will roll out its products with Sky Vegas, Sky Bet, and Sky Bingo.</p>
<p>Evolution’s partnership with Sky Betting &amp; Gaming follows on similar partnerships negotiated between Sky and Red Tiger &amp; NetEnt, two other suppliers and part of the Evolution corporate family, which have already reached agreements with Sky to provide a range of online slot experiences.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming Managing Director for Gaming Andrew Rushgrove welcomed the opportunity to see the live casino portfolio by Evolution boost the company’s breadth and variety of content.</p>
<p>"Sky Vegas is proud to be the UK’s most popular online Casino and we see a great opportunity in the Live Casino market," Rushgrove said. Evolution has developed a range of powerful experiences for the live casino segment which are without precedent.</p>
<p>The company has titles such as Lightning Roulette, Monopoly Live, Deal or No Deal, Crazy Time, and many other show and traditional-style live casino games that are some of the best-performing products in the segment. Evolution is equally confident that it will continue to maintain a steady production pace in 2023.</p>
<p>Evolution CEO for Europe, Gionata La Torre, was equally pleased with the opportunity to follow up on the company’s previous partnerships with Flutter Brands, namely Paddy Power and Betfair. The new alliance with Sky Betting &amp; Gaming allows Evolution to further strengthen its positions and deliver on the desired content players need.</p>
<p>"We are very much looking forward to adding to those player experiences with our world-leading live casino," La Torre concluded. Meanwhile, Evolution has been expanding in other markets as well.</p>
<p>The company teamed up with Codere Online for a stronger market presence in the iGaming market in Panama. Evolution also opened a second live studio in New Jersey to meet surging demand for its casino products in North America.</p>
