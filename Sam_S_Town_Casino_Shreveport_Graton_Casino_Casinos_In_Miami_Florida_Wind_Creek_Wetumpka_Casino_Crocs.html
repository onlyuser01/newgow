<p>Everi Payments Inc., the financial technology subsidiary of Everi Holdings Inc., a renowned provider of land-based and digital casino gaming content, financial technology, and player loyalty solutions, announced a significant victory in the United States legal arena. This triumph comes in the wake of a protracted patent lawsuit filed by Sightline Payments LLC.</p>
<p>Judge Dismisses Sightline’s Lawsuit Over ‘Cash Club Wallet’ Patents</p>
<p>Sightline Payments initiated the legal action on September 30, 2021, lodging a lawsuit against Everi and its affiliate in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas. The lawsuit centered on allegations that Everi’s “Cash Club Wallet” product infringed upon multiple patents owned by Sightline, collectively referred to as the “Sightline Patents.”</p>
<p>However, on June 1, 2022, US District Judge Alan Albright delivered a decisive dismissal of the case. The judge concluded that the complaint did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that Everi Games Holding had engaged in any infringing acts. The dismissal emphasized that the allegations failed to establish a direct link between Everi Games Holding and the Cash Club Wallet, rendering the infringement claims unsupported.</p>
<p>Undeterred, Everi swiftly responded to the legal challenge by filing petitions for inter partes review proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) in the United States. These petitions contested all the claims made against Everi during the Texas legal action. Commencing on August 30, 2023, the PTAB issued five Final Written Decisions, each unequivocally declaring that the patent claims asserted by Sightline against Everi were “unpatentable.”</p>
<p>Everi’s Chief Legal Officer Delighted with PTAB’s Ruling in Patent Case</p>
<p>Kate Lowenhar-Fisher, chief legal officer of Everi, expressed her satisfaction with the outcome, stating: “Everi is gratified that after reviewing all of the facts and testimony, the PTAB found in our favor. As with all litigation there is uncertainty and additional appeals may be forthcoming. Our company will continue to provide its best-in-class technology while respecting the valid intellectual property rights of others.”</p>
<p>In addition to this legal victory, the gaming industry is witnessing other legal developments. Notably, MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment are facing legal actions stemming from recent data breaches, further highlighting the legal complexities surrounding the gaming sector.</p>
<p>In other news, Everi Holdings was recognized as one of Nevada’s top workplaces for the third consecutive year. This award, based on employee feedback collected by Energage, highlights the company’s commitment to a positive workplace culture and earned Everi Holdings four Culture Excellence awards in 2023. CEO Randi Taylor credited the company’s success to the dedication of its team members.</p>
