<p>Thunderspin slots and software</p>
<p>Slots are Thunderspin's speciality and they count vivid graphics and entertaining gameplay among their defining characteristics.</p>
<p>Vikings: Frozen Gods is one of their recent releases and takes the player back to ancient Scandinavia, where powerful deities such as Odin and Loki watch over the icy landscape. Dramatic music dominates the scene as you're presented with a novel design feature: instead of spinning, the five reels disappear into the cave behind them briefly before returning in a different order. Different combinations of warrior symbols and weapons will determine if you win a prize but keep an eye out for when Loki goes wild and appears on the grid – you could be in for a payout. Each god can award you a multiplier, while Valkyrie is the Scatter and can give you an extra round, if you're lucky.</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, fans of glamorous witches will love Halloween Witch Party. The witch invites you to her mansion for a party and proves to be an extremely generous host: she gives player a bonus for each ghost they collect, including several free spins. The Jack O'Lantern is the Scatter and won't be hard to spot with its glowing face.</p>
<p>Thunderspin also caters to sports fans with its World Cup Football game. Players start off by choosing two teams from 32 possible nations. Each one is subject to a special win coefficient, which will determine the size of your win (the coefficient x the jackpot fund). You can change teams during the match but be warned: the jackpot fund disappears if you do this, so you'll get a reduced win. One spin is equal to one minute of a 90-minute game and adds 5% of the current bet to the jackpot fund. Free spins are represented by player moves that try to score a goal to land you money. The game is a little tricky to understand but still great fun for football fanatics.</p>
<p>Note: All of the games in Thunderspin's range benefit from HTML5 software so that they can be played on multiple platforms and use tailored retaining mechanics to come up with engaging plots for the player. The result is an easy-on-the-eye slots game that can keep you entertained for a good while.</p>
