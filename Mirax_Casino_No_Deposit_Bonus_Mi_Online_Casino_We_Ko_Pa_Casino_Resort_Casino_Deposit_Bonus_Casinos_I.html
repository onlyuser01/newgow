<p>BetMGM, the acclaimed iGaming and online sports betting brand in the United States, has made a trip across the Atlantic and is now officially rolled out in the United Kingdom, the company announced in a press release today.</p>
<p>This is BetMGM’s first entry into Europe and the United Kingdom and it will leverage the technology and platform of LeoVegas, a company that MGM Resorts acquired previously.</p>
<p>The rollout is a major milestone for MGM Resorts International which focused on building its footprint in the United States over the past several years but may now be signaling its determination to expand globally, as indicated by the company’s recent launch in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts CEO and President Bill Hornbuckle has welcomed this landmark opportunity and said that BetMGM is already an established sports betting and online casino brand, and it would serve well to international players.</p>
<p>The entire brand was built with international expansion in mind, Hornbuckle noted, and added: "Today's announcement represents a key step forward in our international growth strategy, which has been advancing rapidly since our acquisition of LeoVegas."</p>
<p>The synergies derived from MGM Resorts’ acquisition of LeoVegas are there. LeoVegas is itself a company that has a well-established operational and technological footprint in global markets, making it easier for BetMGM to venture outside of North America and find new homes in Europe.</p>
<p>BetMGM is already rolling out in strength, bringing its full portfolio of products to local audiences in the United Kingdom, while maintaining a high standard of responsible play. Commenting on this launch, MGM Resorts International Interactive President Gary Fritz was similarly excited about the opportunities.</p>
<p>Fritz cited BetMGM brand’s success in both the United States and Canada and said that building outside of these bastions it made the most sense to start in the United Kingdom – a mature online gambling market that offers ample opportunities for companies that bring sports betting and online gambling products to local crowds.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is indeed one of the world’s most welcoming gambling markets, but it has been undergoing a big overhaul of its rather dated laws. Public consultations are expected to have a significant impact on the industry, but this has not swayed BetMGM’s resolve to launch in the United Kingdom, and from there, to trampoline its product to other markets in Europe.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning, it seems, of BetMGM’s story outside North America, and it seems to be a promising one.</p>
