<p>Ho-Chunk $405M Beloit Casino Project Cleared for Take Off</p>

<p>The federal government’s Bureau of Indian Affairs said Friday it would place 32-acres of land in Beloit, Wis. into trust for the Ho-Chunk Nation. This was the final requirement for the tribe to begin construction on a $405 million casino on the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>The Ho-Chunk Nation is one of Wisconsin’s 11 federally recognized tribes, and its biggest casino operator. The Beloit casino will be the tribe’s seventh statewide.</p>
<p>The BIA sign-off comes a year after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers gave the casino his blessing. The Beloit project is one of just a handful of off-reservation tribal casinos that have been approved in the US, and the governor had the power to veto it. That would not usually be the case with an on-reservation casino.</p>
<p>In 2015, Evers’ predecessor, Republican Gov. Scott Walker, sunk a plan by the Menominee tribe to build a casino complex in the city of Kenosha in partnership with the Hard Rock.</p>
<p>The land-in-trust process is where the federal government partially removes a parcel of land from the jurisdiction of the state to convert it into tribal sovereign land.</p>
<p>People of Kecak</p>
<p>The Ho-Chunk have been floating the idea of a casino in Beloit for almost 20 years, and applied for BIA approval around nine years ago. Off-reservation casinos take a notoriously long time to approve.</p>
<p>In order for land to be taken into trust, a tribe must prove to have ancestral ties to the area. The Ho-Chunk claim they are “The aboriginal people of Kecak,” a native village on which Beloit now stands.</p>
<p>The casino complex will include a convention center, hotel, and a water park. The tribe says it will create 1,300 permanent jobs and 3,000 construction jobs.</p>
<p>The Nation sees this project as an investment to recover from the pandemic and create new economic opportunities for everyone,” Ho-Chunk spokesman Ryan Greendeer told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</p>
<p>The tribe now plans to finalize design and infrastructure work before construction commences, he added.</p>
<p>Rockford Competition</p>
<p>The casino will be a stone’s throw from the Illinois state line, which makes it a direct competitor with the planned Hard Rock in Rockford, Ill., just 17 miles away.</p>
<p>Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has vowed that he will do “everything possible” to give Rockford first-mover advantage.</p>
<p>But Beloit City Manager Lori Curtis Luther believes that the Rockford project is “not on scale of the entertainment destination proposed in Beloit.”</p>
<p>On Friday, she thanked the BIA for signing the project off, so that the city could “welcome the Ho-Chunk Nation home to Kecak.”</p>
