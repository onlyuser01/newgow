<p>The leading software developer, Swintt, announced a new global distribution deal with Kindred Group, the globally recognized online gambling operator that has a strong presence in Europe. Details regarding the new deal emerged Monday and see the iGaming content supplier agree to deliver a portion of its SwinttPremium and SwinttGames titles to the operator's MGA, SGA, KSA and UKGC-licensed platforms.</p>
<p>The latest deal comes during a busy second quarter of 2023 for Swintt. The collaboration reaffirms the company's commitment to growing its reach and engaging with new customers in different markets. Under the terms of the new deal, the software developer will power Kindred's operations in Malta, Sweden and the Netherlands. Moreover, at a later point, Swintt will provide its games for Kindred's UK-facing operations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the deal enables the iGaming content supplier to significantly expand the reach of its games, considering Kindred's 1.5 million active customer base. The global gaming group is behind some of the most popular brands in Europe, including 32Red, Mria Casino and Unibet.</p>
<p>Kindred is known as one of the leading betting and iGaming operators on the Old Continent and it is recognized for its commitment to sustainable growth and responsible gambling. The company is renowned for its efforts to reduce the revenue generated from problem gambling.</p>
<p>Gareth Jennings, Kindred Group's Head of RNG, shared his excitement about the new partnership in a statement. "At Kindred Group, we always try to collaborate with software providers that share our vision and ideas for the online gambling industry while also providing a secure, first-class gambling experience to customers across our full range of platforms," he said.</p>
<p>Finally, Jennings pointed out: "In Swintt, we believe we’ve teamed up with a company that delivers on both of these fronts and we’re really looking forward to adding their innovative range of titles to our Malta, Sweden, UK and Netherlands-facing brands to give players an even greater selection of casino games to choose from."</p>
<p>David Mann, Swintt's Chief Executive Officer, shared Jennings' excitement and revealed that the company is delighted to join forces with such a trusted operator with a large customer base. Additionally, he said that Swintt is looking forward to the unique opportunities that will emerge from the new partnership.</p>
<p>"By making SwinttGames and SwinttPremium releases available to such a wide cross-section of customers, we’ll be able to further raise the profile of our brand across Europe while helping Kindred Group on its ongoing mission to deliver a safe and enjoyable online experience to all casino players," explained Swintt's Chief Executive Officer in conclusion.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, customers of Kindred's brands are expected to benefit from popular releases from SwinttGames' portfolio. Such include The Crown, a popular slot that designates a portion of its revenue to charity, as well as other hits, including Electric Elements, Candy Gold and Aloha Spirit XtraLockTM, among others.</p>
