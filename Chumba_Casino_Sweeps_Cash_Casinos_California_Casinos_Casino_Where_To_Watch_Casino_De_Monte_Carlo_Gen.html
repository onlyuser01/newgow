<p>European iGaming company Superbet Group has announced a new player engagement-oriented marketing partnership with sports data and technology company Genius Sports. Under the agreement, the latter will power the operator with free-to-play games, designed to attract new players.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Will Create Games for Superbet</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Genius Sports will work with Superbet to create entirely personalized free-to-play prediction games for the operator’s player base. The new titles will be designed to engage and retain existing players, as well as attract new ones.</p>
<p>Genius Sports is one of the go-to companies when it comes to predictor games. It is renowned for its data-driven fantasy sports, sports trivia and pick-em titles, tailored to the preferences of its partners across the global sports betting landscape. Genius Sports supplies some of the biggest companies in the sector and is working together with gambling brands such as Betway and bet365, as well as with sports leagues including the National Football League and Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>The current deal expands Genius Sports and Superbet’s existing relationship. The two companies have long maintained a data, trading and live streaming-oriented partnership that was expanded earlier this year, no less. The agreement is also in line with Superbet Group’s wider strategy to leverage technology to fuel its growth. The operator is also working on in-house tech that can be scaled to global leader standards. In the meantime, it continues to work with reputable gaming companies such as Genius Sports.</p>
<p>Superbet Will Be Able to Engage Its Players at All Times</p>
<p>Adam Shaw, Superbet Group’s chief revenue officer, spoke about the new agreement and its importance. He confirmed that Superbet group remains committed to using best-in-class tech-powered solutions to engage its vast customer base. To fulfill this promise, the company continues to invest in tech while working alongside industry leaders.</p>
<p>To deliver on that promise, we have a strategy of consistent investments in developing our own proprietary core technology. At the same time, we recognize Genius Sports Limited is the right kind of partner, that can increase the variety of our digital offering and enhance the quality of our customer experience. Adam Shaw, CRO, Superbet Group</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Josh Linforth, Genius Sports’ managing director of media and entertainment, said that the current agreement will set a new standard for working with the sportsbook on fan engagement titles. Linforth added that his team will work closely with Superbet Group to devise and build exciting predictor games and marketing campaigns. He is certain that the content will resonate with the operator’s player base and drive engagement.</p>
