    <h1>Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg Indiana Stratosphere Casino Is Casino A True Story Casino Baton Rouge</h1>

<p>Veronica Brill and 87 other plaintiffs in the cheating allegations case against Mike Postle, King’s Casino and Justin Kuraitis are going to receive a settlement, the latest court filing in the case suggests. August 5 Mac VerStandig filed a request asking for a third time extension regarding the plaintiffs’ amended complaint, stating that both sides have agreed to a settlement in general, needing to work out the details.</p>
<p>In June, all complaints against Mike Postle and defendants were dismissed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California. Judge William B Shubb dismissed claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment against Mike Postle with prejudice, leaving the door open for an appeal, while claims for negligent misrepresentation, negligence, constructive fraud, fraud and a libel claim against King’s Casino were dismissed with leave to amend. Plaintiffs were given 20 days to file an amended complaint.</p>
<p>Settlement Reached, Time Needed to Work Out Details</p>
<p>Mac VerStanding asked the court for more time to communicate individually with every plaintiff to make sure all 88 of them have agreed to the terms of the settlement reached in principle.</p>
<p>“Counsel for the parties have reached an agreement as to the principal terms of a settlement of this case, but require additional time to finalize the settlement,” Mac VerStandig</p>
<p>Mike Postle was accused of cheating based entirely on statistical probability as his win ratio during televised cash games in $1-$3 and $2-$5 limits was unseen before, raising questions whether the player was using some kind of an electronic device to get access to his opponents’ hole cards, being assisted in the process by someone in the casino. During his TV cameos featuring consistent winning sessions, Mike Postle was estimated to have won in excess of $300,000.</p>
<p>Veronica Brill started the accusations and was later on supported by several other poker pros, all arguing the statistical improbability for such a consistent winning run, but with no hard proof that Mike Postle cheated in any way during the televised poker sessions.</p>
<p>Despite having all claims against him dismissed, Mike Postle is not entirely out of the woods yet, as a second lawsuit was filed against him. Ex fashion model now poker pro Marle Cordeiro claimed she was cheated, seeking $250,000 in punitive damages plus three times the amount of money she lost to Postle in the live-streamed cash games at the Stones Gambling Hall.</p>
