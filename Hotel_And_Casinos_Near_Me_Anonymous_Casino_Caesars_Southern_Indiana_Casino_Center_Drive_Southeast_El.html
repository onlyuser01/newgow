<p>The San Francisco 49ers vs. Philadelphia Eagles is arguably the most interesting game of Week 13 of the 2023 NFL</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles are 10-1 in the 2023 NFL, with five wins in a row. This is very impressive due to the fact that they defeated some really tough opponents in those games. Can they add another win to the tally?</p>
<p>Judging by the 49ers vs. Eagles odds, it’s not going to be easy. The boys from Philly are seen as underdogs, even though they’re undefeated on their turf this season.</p>

<p>San Francisco 49ers to Show They Can Do Well in Big Games</p>
<p>The Niners are 8-3 overall with the best defense in the National Football Conference. They’re also second in the conference, sharing that spot with their next opponent.</p>
<p>These guys are in good form with three straight wins, but all those happened against teams that are way weaker than Philly. In fact, San Francisco usually does well against underdogs but doesn’t show up in the games with big teams.</p>
<p>The toughest opponent they defeated this season was the Dallas Cowboys. When it comes to their losses, they happened against the Cincinnati Bengals, Minnesota Vikings, and Cleveland Browns.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles Confident of Another Win</p>
<p>The Eagles have been sensational this season, which their 10-1 record clearly proves. They’re on a five-game winning streak, beating several Lombardi Trophy candidates, including the Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs, and Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>Led by the Swiss army knife of a quarterback Jalen Hurts, the Eagles’ offense has plenty of weapons in its arsenal. Philly’s defense hasn’t been too impressive in 2023 with 22.36 points conceded per game. But that’s because they’ve played against some really tough offenses so far.</p>
<p>Another thing going in their favor is that the Week 13 game is played on their turf. At home, they’re 5-0 this season. Plus, the last time they played against the Niners at the Linc, they won 31-7. It happened in the NFC Championship game that booked the Eagles the ticket to last season’s Super Bowl.</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers vs. Philadelphia Eagles Prediction</p>
<p>The Eagles have slain many giants this season already and we think they’re going to do the same in Week 13. Oddsmakers see them as underdogs, but we think they’re going to overcome the odds.</p>
<p>This is going to be the second time this season that they’ve got longer odds than the opponent. The first of those was against the Chiefs and they ended up winning 21-17.</p>
<p>Pick: Philadelphia Eagles (+126)</p>
