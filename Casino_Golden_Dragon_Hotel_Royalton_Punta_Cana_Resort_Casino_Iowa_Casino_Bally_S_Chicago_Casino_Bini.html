<p>Olga Sirokha has been appointed as the new Director of Partnerships at RubyPlay, an established provider of B2B products and games, which builds innovative and interactive slots for clients across multiple jurisdictions. RubyPlay currently runs its operations out of offices in Australia, Malta, and Ukraine, and has an offer that features more than 80 games.</p>
<p>Sirokha’s appointment will help the company put itself on a stronger foothold as it seeks to expand beyond its current markets and strengthen its positions in existing ones throughout 2024.</p>
<p>The new appointee is no chance pick either, as she brings more than 20 years of relevant experience from the gambling industry, and she has worked specifically in the Latin American’s land-based sector, which gives her a unique insight into potential new territories where RubyPlay would be keen to grow in.</p>
<p>Commenting on this appointment, RubyPlay Chief Product Officer Dr. Eyal Loz has welcomed the opportunity to strengthen the company’s lineup with yet another prominent gambling industry veteran who seems as committed to the company’s future as the entire team at RubyPlay.</p>
<p>"We’ve signed some fantastic agreements with operators recently, and with our eye on further expansion in key markets in the near future, Olga is absolutely the right person for the role," Dr. Loz said.</p>
<p>Understandably, Sirokha was similarly pleased to be taking up this position with the company and said that she is joining the supplier at a truly important time of rapid expansion. As the new Head of Partnerships, she will seek to help establish new rapports between the company and potential clients who are looking to bolster their portfolio with world-class games.</p>
<p>"Recent partnerships with some of the industry’s biggest brands have put us in good stead for the future. I’m thrilled to be able to contribute to even more growth as we approach 2024," Sirokha added.</p>
<p>RubyPlay has been steadily increasing its presence across different markets, with the company launching its content with PokerStars in Italy. The supplier has also strengthened and expanded its presence with REEVO, a provider of aggregation solutions which hand-picks its partner studios and allows them access to a vast array of operators.</p>
<p>Speaking of aggregation opportunities, RubyPlay pursued a similar aggregation deal with another well-established name in the iGaming business, SOFTSWISS. Under Sirokha’s leadership, RubyPlay is only to gather more momentum seeking to establish new ties and ensure that RubyPlay’s product and offer are available to new and worthwhile partners.</p>
