<p>William Hill, one of the leading sports betting brands, has signed a new partnership with Aston Villa, a prominent Premier League soccer club</p>
<p>As a result of this alliance, William Hill is becoming the official in-stadium betting partner for the team. This tie-up will lead to better fan experiences over the next two seasons with William Hill offering dedicated facilities directly at Villa Park stadium.</p>
<p>The partnership comes at a time when regulators are taking a hard look at the partnerships between soccer clubs and betting companies and the reregulation of the sector.</p>
<p>Welcomed Opportunity for the Club, Brand, and Fans</p>
<p>Fans and attendees will have the opportunity to benefit from exclusive offers and promotions, along with match tickets and club merchandise. Commenting on the opportunity, William Hill director of media &amp; UK creative Liam McKee had this to add:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to be teaming up with Aston Villa and to be delivering our unrivaled retail betting experience, along with some exciting offers and opportunities, to Villa supporters. William Hill director of media &amp; UK creative Liam McKee</p>
<p>Aston Villa CCO Nicola Ibbetson was similarly pleased to welcome William Hill as Villa Park’s new in-stadium partner. According to Ibbetson, William Hill is the world’s leading sports betting brand, retail betting, and is looking forward to bringing some exciting new opportunities to Villa fans.</p>
<p>Aston Villa has not been shy about its ties with gambling companies, which are still one of the biggest sponsors for sports teams worldwide. Previously, the club signed with betting agency Kaiyun Sports as the club’s official sleeve sponsor. As to the club’s European presence, Aston Villa agreed to introduce Duelbits, another sportsbook operator, as its official partner for the region.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear how any potential changes in UK gambling laws would impact Aston Villa’s ability to maintain these deals in place and continue working with gambling companies. Earlier this year, Premier League clubs were said to take a voluntary step towards dropping gambling sponsorships.</p>
<p>However, the issue of finding an adequate substitute remains, and the lack of events during the pandemic is still biting into clubs’ bottom lines making them to an extent reluctant to let go of reliable partners such as betting companies.</p>
