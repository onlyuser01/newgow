    <h1>Casablanca Casino Crown Casino Funclub Casino Login Dreams Casino Login Scioto Downs Casino TrueFort</h1>

<p>Hello, I have been playing in this casino for a while and I made sporadic deposits since I only asked to make them for bitcoin.</p>
<p>On July 16 of this year</p>
<p>I made a deposit of 30 dlls and they gave me 1 bonus without wagrred and one that only allows me to withdraw 100 dlls, I win 600 dlls</p>
<p>And I put my withdrawal and they tell me that I can only withdraw 100 that I would lose 500 I was disappointed but I accepted,</p>
<p>Then they tell me to send my stationery. To request it, I send it and I don't receive a response about what's going on...</p>
<p>Bored I was going to deposit again and this legend comes</p>
<p>"You have pending withdrawals that can be invested instead of making a deposit.</p>
<p>Any withdrawal listed below can be invested and refunded to your account."</p>
<p>I make the refund and oh surprise</p>
<p>Luck smiled at me and I accumulated the amount of 32,000 dollars</p>
<p>I had never withdrawn, I always collected 100,200, and expected more and lost.</p>
<p>Excited I put the withdrawal and they only allow me 1000 dollars</p>
<p>When asked in the live chat, they do not give me solutions to reach an agreement with someone who commits or is responsible for what they offer.</p>
<p>I understand high amounts are not possible but 20 minutes ago I asked again and they already treated me badly in customer service before when I lost very well, they already lowered my withdrawals to 500 and without anything or anyone to tell me in 15 days or so for week.</p>
<p>Or something that is a solution</p>
<p>this is after the britany people canceled the bonus and they took me almost 500 dlls</p>
<p>prizes</p>
<p>I will put some</p>
<p>I just want professionalism and reach an agreement and have a commitment d3 how things will be done not be uncertain about the future</p>
<p>Then I discovered this page and I hope you can help me I am in the best of availability to talk and reach a deal</p>
