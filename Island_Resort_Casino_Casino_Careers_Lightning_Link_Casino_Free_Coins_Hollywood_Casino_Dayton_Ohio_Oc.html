<p>Amid the ongoing review of the Gambling Act in the UK, another lead part of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announced his resignation. Earlier this week, Damian Collins, announced his decision to step down from his role with the DCMS.</p>
<p>Damian Collins Steps Down from DCMS</p>
<p>In a statement released via Twitter, Collins revealed that it was exciting to collaborate with the expert team within the DCMS. Together with the DCMS, he helped push forward strategic measures such as the Online Safety Bill. However, Collins revealed that he decided to step down from his current position and added that he will further support the efforts of the DCMS in parliament from the backbenches.</p>
<p>“It has been a real pleasure to work with the team DCMS to take forward the Online Safety Bill and other measures to strengthen our digital economy. I will now continue to support these efforts in parliament from the backbenches.“ Damian Collins</p>
<p>Fourth Minister to Resign the Position</p>
<p>Collins has been a Member of Parliament (MP) for Folkestone and Hythe since 2010. Between 2016 and 2019, he was a chair of the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, while in 2021, he chaired the UK Parliament Joint Committee for the draft of the Online Safety Bill, a proposal that seeks to improve the internet security and safety.</p>
<p>It was back in July when Collins took the leading role with the DCMS as Minister for Tech and Digital. This happened after Chris Philp resigned in protest of PM Boris Johnson’s leadership. But they are not the only two ministers to resign from the position. Nigel Huddleston and John Wittingdale were also in that role but decided to step down.</p>
<p>Collins’ decision to resign follows the appointment of Michelle Donelan as the secretary of state for the DCMS. Britain’s former PM, Liz Truss, announced Donelan’s appointment last month. Now, under the new prime minister Rishi Sunak, Donelan will continue to serve in her position with the DCMS.</p>
