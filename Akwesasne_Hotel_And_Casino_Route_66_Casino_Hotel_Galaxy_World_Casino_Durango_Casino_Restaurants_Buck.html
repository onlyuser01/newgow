<p>Yes. Nothing but issues. I have too many to name. I have them recorded and it’s really really bad to try to get involved in this. I just need someone of a respected position to talk some sense into these people. Being deceptive and misleading people. Then to top it off they won’t even give me my comprehensive game history because it’s damaging to them. It proves that these games are fixed. They are the most predictable, same resulting, scams I have ever seen. They use deceptive practices, misleading statements, and just all around defrauding people to sell their service. If they had nothing to hide, or if they were honest and trustworthy as they say. They wouldn’t have to further prove me right by denying me the results of my own spins. Look you know what’s right and what’s wrong correct? Well you know it’s not too much for a player to ask for and should be honored at any respectable casino. Every player should have the right to ensure they are not being scammed out of their money. This is all documented and recorded. I am trying to just get some kind of justice and I would appreciate it if you didn’t do what you always do. Protect the casino at all costs and end up telling me no even though I’m legally in the right. Please redeem yourself. It’s only my play history. It’s the truth… A casino can’t deny me the truth or it’s fraud. For their terms and conditions to be considered a contract between the casino and I, everything has to be upfront and honest. Transparent. Welll I have proof they are lying for profit and that’s fraud by law. Fraud voids any contract between us and I am entitled to the refunding of my losses and I can even seen damages. Also they will be subject to interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum. Now that play history contains evidence if I am correct or not about my accusations and if they are keeping it from me that’s already guilty.</p>
