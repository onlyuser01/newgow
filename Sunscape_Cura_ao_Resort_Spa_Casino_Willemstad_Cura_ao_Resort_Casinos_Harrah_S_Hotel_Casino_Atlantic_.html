<p>Manchester City welcomes Liverpool in a battle of the 2023-24 English Premier League (EPL) giants, which will take place at Etihad Stadium on Saturday, November 25</p>
<p>After drawing 4-4 with Chelsea in the previous round of the 2023-24 EPL, Manchester City is now in danger of dropping out of the No. 1 position in the standings. The Cityzens’ next opponent Liverpool is one of the teams that could overtake the Premier League throne with a win on November 25.</p>
<p>Other teams that stand a chance of leapfrogging Manchester City are Arsenal, Tottenham, and even Aston Villa. For all these reasons, the Man City vs. Liverpool duel on Saturday is a must-win game for Pep Guardiola’s men.</p>

<p>Guardiola’s Boys Look Unbeatable at Etihad Stadium</p>
<p>Manchester City is 9-1-2 overall in the 2023-24 Prem, with a 5-0-0 record at Etihad Stadium. On their turf, they have all wins in all competitions this year. That’s 27 home games won in a row for Pep Guardiola’s boys.</p>
<p>The last time they drew a game at Etihad was on New Year’s Eve, while the last time we saw them lose a home game was over a year ago. That’s when they lost 2-1 to Brentford in a game in which they simply weren’t in a good mood for playing soccer.</p>

<p>Now, they look determined to win, especially following a 4-4 draw with Chelsea in the previous round. It was a real thriller, in which their former player Cole Palmer scored the equalizer for the London-based team in the fifth minute of stoppage time.</p>
<p>Man City’s players can think of the draw as a failure, which they need to fix now. They need to win against Liverpool to make sure they’ll stay at the top of the EPL table.</p>
<p>Can the Reds Conquer Etihad on November 25?</p>
<p>Liverpool is 8-3-1 this season, with just one point fewer than Manchester City. If the Reds win on Saturday, they’re gonna get to the top of the EPL table. So, can they pull it off?</p>
<p>They definitely have the offense that could do it. Mohamed Salah is their scoring leader with 10 goals to his name, but there are another four attackers on Liverpool’s roster who have scored at least two goals in the 2023-24 Premier League – Darwin Nunez (4 goals), Diogo Jota (4), Luis Diaz (3), and Cody Gakpo (2).</p>
<p>With such players in the squad, it’s no surprise Jurgen Klopp’s team has scored at least a goal in each game this season in all competitions. In fact, each time the Reds failed to get on target was in early April when they played 0-0 with Chelsea.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs. Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that we’re going to see a real thriller at Etihad. Both teams are incredible offensively, so it would be really strange if we didn’t see goals galore on November 25. But which team will score more?</p>
<p>We honestly can’t tell, even though the Man City vs. Liverpool odds suggest it’s the home team that’s more likely to win. Still, if we absolutely had to pick one of the three possible outcomes, we’d go with the draw.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester City vs. Liverpool – draw &amp; over 3.5 goals</p>
