<p>Dear Jose,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding all the relevant communication. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://cobraspins.com/templates/company/responsible_gaming:</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>Self- Exclusion is a more extensive way to control your activity at cobraspins.com.</p>
<p>Self-exclusion means that you decide to close your account for a period up to 3 months. In case you wish to Self- Exclude your account, please contact our Customer Support Team who will be happy to assist you."</p>
<p>https://cobraspins.com/templates/company/terms_and_conditions:</p>
<p>"Self exclude or Timeout - We will only reply to emails sent to support@cobraspins.com for this action and clearly mark in the subject line 'Account Closure. Any emails not stating your reason for closing eg; gambling problem will not be actioned as an urgent request. We take these requests seriously but due to the high levels of emails it may take us some time to reply. Any deposits made before the account is closed will be accepted and are non refundable."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email to support@cobraspins.com including all the relevant information. In this way, you’ll have proof of such an action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence if it’s visibly marked as "Self-exclusion" you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. If it won’t work this time, we will intervene.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
