<p>Patrick Reed was at 40/1 to win the Masters on Wednesday night. Sunday evening, he was donning the green jacket in Augusta, Georgia, after successfully fending off final round charges from some of the game’s biggest stars.</p>

<p>Jordan Spieth, who entered the week ranked #4 in the world and attracted some of the most money at sportsbooks, began the final round nine back of Reed. He tore up Augusta National on his way to an eight-under par 64.</p>
<p>Rickie Fowler, another fan favorite who was the #8-ranked player in the world entering the Masters, also applied the pressure on Sunday. He shot a -5 under 67, and birdied 18 to finish one ahead of Spieth, but one behind the leader.</p>
<p>Not known for keeping his emotions in check, the flamboyant Reed was a cool customer on the closing holes. A two-putt par on 18 sealed the 27-year-old’s first major.</p>
<p>“In the past, I put too much pressure on myself. I went out there and I tried so hard to get the ball in the hole, I tried so hard to hit the perfect shots. Going into this week I was just like, ‘Hey, it’s golf. Go play,'” Reed explained.</p>
<p>Major Win for Sportsbooks</p>
<p>The first of four majors, the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas said the 2018 Masters set a new handle record before the first round even began. And fortunately for the casino, a longshot put on the green jacket Sunday night.</p>
<p>With Tiger Woods once again playing well, recent victories from Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson, and profusion of young guns as confident as ever, the 82nd edition of the Masters was one of the more highly anticipated majors in recent years.</p>
<p>Prior to the first drive on Thursday, the SuperBook said Woods was responsible for the most ticket slips and most money wagered. Here’s the breakdown, per oddsmaker Jeff Sherman:</p>
<p>Ticket count: Woods, Watson, Mickelson, Fowler, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Justin Rose, Spieth, Matt Kuchar, Dustin Johnson. Money wagered: Woods, McIlroy, Johnson, Thomas, Fowler, Rose, Jon Rahm, Spieth, Mickelson, Jason Day.</p>
<p>The name nowhere to be found on either list is of course Patrick Reed.</p>
<p>Online sportsbook Bovada also won on group prop bets such as the Spieth, Thomas, Johnson, McIlroy, and Woods to win offering. The odds of either one of those five winning were at Yes +150, No -180.</p>
<p>Sherman said recently that the best result for the house is for big names like Woods, Spieth, and Johnson to play well, but not win. That’s precisely what happened at the Masters.</p>
<p>Open Contest</p>
<p>Despite Reed’s -15 performance at Augusta, the seventh-lowest total score in Masters history, sports bettors aren’t too excited about backing the first major winner of the year at June’s US Open.</p>
<p>The SuperBook opens the 118th US Open to be played at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club with world #1 Dustin Johnson the favorite at 10/1. That line is shared with Spieth and McIlroy.</p>
<p>DJ finished T10 at the Masters, while McIlroy, who played in the final group with Reed, struggled Sunday to a T5 finish.</p>
<p>As for the US Open, Thomas is next at 12/1, with Day rounding out the top five at 14/1. The SuperBook is presumably looking to take early action on Woods, as the sportsbook has Tiger at 25/1.</p>
