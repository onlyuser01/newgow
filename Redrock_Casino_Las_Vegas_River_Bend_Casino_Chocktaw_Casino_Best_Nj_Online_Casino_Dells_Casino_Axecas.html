    <h1>Redrock Casino Las Vegas River Bend Casino Chocktaw Casino Best Nj Online Casino Dells Casino Axecas</h1>

<p>I am a frequent player at online casinos and have considered quitting several times, not due to losses, but due to the payment ethics of the online casinos that I cannot fathom. As a player, I am consistently at a disadvantage, so why do they always try everything to avoid payouts? This I do not understand. Half of my circle of friends have stopped online gambling due to this and turned to physical casinos with an RTP of 94% and instant cash in hand. The industry is destroying itself. More people would be gaming online long-term if the casinos were fair and correct. In the case of Dama Casino, where since November I have deposited 570 euros, I haven't experienced this yet. Now, I want a withdrawal of 3400 euros, which has been pending since Thursday. My withdrawal request hasn't been processed since Thursday despite having all the necessary documents. First, they said the managing team hasn't responded yet, then on Monday my withdrawal was cancelled again and I was advised to withdraw via bank, which was a hassle. The chat support, except for Beatrix, provided scripted responses which were appalling. Today, the chat response was that my payout couldn't be issued as the managing team needed to review everything again. I havenâ€™t bet over the maximum stake. At last, I sent an auto-authorization code (or something similar) of the last payment because it was not fully booked yet. My bank advised me to provide the code as a safety measure. I deposited 50 euros via Mastercard at 23:30 for the 150% bonus, and error occurred. I thought the deposit failed, so I deposited another 50 euros. To my surprise, my casino account had a balance of 187.50 euros. Checking my bank account, I realized that the initial 50 euros deposit was successful, so, in frustration, I thought I could have deposited 100 euros at once for the 150% bonus as I only had 150% bonus on the first deposit, and 25% from the daily reload on the second. That's why, to my surprise, I had 187.50 euros on my account. Deciding against arguing with chat support, I chose to play. Hence, I did nothing wrong and provided a copy of the last payment and the auto code to the casino as my bank advised. I suffer from high blood pressure and have spent at least 3 hours daily since Thursday battling with chat support. I haven't experienced anything like this in my 4 years of online gaming. I am exhausted and could sense that like many other casinos reluctant to payout, they will not back down. I am increasingly visiting physical casinos due to my increasing fear and anxiety over my withdrawals.</p>
