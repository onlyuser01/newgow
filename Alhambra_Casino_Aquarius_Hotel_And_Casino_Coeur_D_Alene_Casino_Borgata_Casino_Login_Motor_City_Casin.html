<p>A relatively new sports affiliate marketing business, Sports Gambling Guides (SGG), received further investor backing in a $2 million second round funding. Among the new investors at SGG was venture capital firm Astralis Capital.</p>
<p>Targeting Social Media Customer Engagement</p>
<p>SGG, the social media-focused sports marketing company launched in 2020 that offers a bold new take on conventional affiliate marketing, received $2 million in new investor funding. Established by a father and a son, SGG has been growing ever since its inception and is currently boasting an experienced team of 17 entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results of the second round funding for SGG, the company’s co-founder and president Troy Paul outlined the interest SGG has attracted from many investors including Astralis Capital, hailing their decision to back the affiliate business as a “testament” to the work done so far and the shared “vision for growth going forward.”</p>
<p>“Over the coming months, we intend to repay the faith investors have shown in us by expanding our client database and providing engaging social media content that reaches an even bigger audience. We’re looking forward to running exciting campaigns that return even greater value to our partners.” Troy Paul, Co-Founder and President, SGG</p>
<p>Specialist in social media marketing, SGG is currently boasting a network of over 800 content creators across Twitter and Instagram who have a combined audience of more than 22 million followers. SGG firmly established itself as one of the three largest US sports gambling accounts on Instagram and one of the top 10 on Twitter and attracted the attention of venture capital firms like Astralis.</p>
<p>Significant Presence in the Affiliate Space</p>
<p>Commenting on the funding round results, Astralis Capital Management’s managing director Evan Meyer outlined SGG’s fast rise to prominence, having “built a significant presence in the affiliate and advertising space.”</p>
<p>“With their expanding product capability set, influencer/follower bases, we believe SGG can be a partner of choice for a wide range of advertisers to reach passionate and loyal sports and gambling enthusiasts.” Evan Meyer, Managing Director, Astralis Capital</p>
<p>Astralis Fund I LP, a venture fund dedicated to iGaming, sports betting and digital gaming under Astralis Capital Management, is constantly seeking to identify transformative digital gaming businesses and provide support for management teams at innovative early-stage companies and offer them strategic guidance and industry connectivity to help them maximize value for their stakeholders.</p>
<p>SGG’s clients include high-profile sports betting brands such as DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, PointsBet, and others, as well as PrizePicks in the daily fantasy sports, all benefiting from SGG’s daily postings reaching millions in audiences across targeted markets in the US.</p>
<p>Currently licensed in all legal online betting jurisdictions in the US, SGG is looking to enter into new states as soon as they open up. The disruptor of conventional affiliate marketing is also planning to expand its client portfolio as its cost-effective business model attracts more and more partners.</p>
