    <h1>Mardi Gras Casino Oklahoma Casino Map Casino Indiana Best Paying Online Casino Ocean Casino Login He</h1>

<p>Hi this is the email I sent to the company that handles my sort of complaints I have to received a response yet everything is explained here</p>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>My name is Ashley L*** I am writing to you today in regard to my account with the online casino hellspin, I want to discuss and make a formal complaint against the casino how my case has been handled and how I have been treated during. On the 5th of may 2023 I went to withdraw my winnings into my bank account I verified my account input my details for the withdrawal and continued playing on the casino hellspin I noticed my funds where returned back into my account i then contacted the customer support to find out what was the reason for my withdrawal being returned the customer service representative explained that I must not have entered the details correctly and to try again with the right information I went ahead and corrected it and attempted to withdraw my funds again being the sum of $3800 there where no bonuses attached once again after sometime I noticed that the funds once again had been returned into my online casino account. I went ahead and contacted the customer service representative again. They were keen to help me. I then noticed that the funds in my online account had disappeared and went to $100 and my account had been suspended. I asked the customer service representative why this was the case they then explained to me that I had broken the rules of the casino that they came to the conclusion that I had a duplicate account and therefore took my money and suspended my account and left me with my original deposit being $100. I asked for evidence to support their claim, but they could not give me any and end up saying to me that the decision was final, and there was nothing that I could do about it. I am able to show any kind of proof to support my claim in which I do not have a duplicate account my wife also has a account with hellspin we use the wifi at home using the same IP address I have been treated unfairly and I’ve never had a casino put me through what hellspin has and any information that you need for me to show what im claiming to be true and correct I can provide for you I have no problem taking this situation to court and also leaving bad feedback for hellspin casino I have attached screenshots of my conversations with the online support at hellspin for your records please have someone contact me ASAP if I don’t hear from anyone within 2 business days I will be contacting my lawyer thank you for your time</p>
