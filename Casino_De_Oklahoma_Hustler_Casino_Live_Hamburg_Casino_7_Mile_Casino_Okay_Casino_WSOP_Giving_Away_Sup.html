<p>Super Bowl Prize Draw Promo at WSOP.com</p>
<p>One lucky online poker player at WSOP.com will earn a pair of tickets to the 2020 Super Bowl as part of a $10,000 prize package.</p>
<p>Online poker players in Nevada and New Jersey will be able to vie for the chance to win tickets to the upcoming Super Bowl. Thanks to a new promotion launched by Caesars Entertainment and the NFL, one lucky player will earn a Super Bowl prize package worth $10,000.</p>
<p>There are three ways to earn entries into the prize raffle via WSOP.com. Firstly, any player who wins a sit n go tournament with a buy-in of $1 or more, they’ll receive an entry into the draw. Then, new players who make their first deposit using the code “MIAMI” will receive prize draw entries. Finally, entries will be awarded during the Sunday $100,000 guaranteed tournament on WSOP.com.</p>
<p>The promotion will run until January 19th. So, players at WSOP.com will have plenty of time to earn entries into this exciting prize draw.</p>
<p>The winner of the event will receive two Super Bowl tickets and $3,000 for travel expenses which will be deposited into their WSOP account. It is estimated that the prize is worth over $10,000.</p>
<p>“There is so much going on in the Super Bowl host city the week of the event that the WSOP.com winner can truly make this a bigger trip and take advantage of the city of Miami and the many NFL-themed offerings taking place” — Seth Palansky, the Vice President of Corporate Communications for the WSOP.</p>
<p>This year’s Super Bowl is going to be a thrilling event – but, that should come as no surprise. It is always full of excitement and amazing entertainment year after year. In fact, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will be headlining the halftime show, and some special surprise guests may show up.</p>
<p>A First for WSOP and the NFL</p>
<p>Even though the NFL named Caesars Entertainment its official casino partner back in January 2019, this is the first casino promotion being held by the two brands together. They will be monitoring the promotion and keeping an eye on how successful it is.</p>
<p>If the WSOP’s Super Bowl promotion attracts plenty of attention, we could see more exciting contests from the NFL. As such a high-profile brand, the NFL has the potential to offer up some amazing prizes for WSOP online poker players – so, we can’t wait to see what other promotions these two brands will launch in the new year.</p>
