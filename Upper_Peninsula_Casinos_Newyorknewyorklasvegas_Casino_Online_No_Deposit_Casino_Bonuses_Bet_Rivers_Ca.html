    <h1>Upper Peninsula Casinos Newyorknewyorklasvegas Casino Online No Deposit Casino Bonuses Bet Rivers Ca</h1>

<p>Hello dear CasinoGuru Team,</p>
<p>I have spent many days playing at the online casino Luckyblock, where I have deposited BNB. I had played through all of my money, and due to my bets, I received some free spins on the bonus wheel. I won a few free spins on several different slot games on the bonus wheel. After I had played all these spins, my account balance was about 40 Euros. Over the course of several hours, I was able to increase this balance to several hundred Euros.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time buying free spins on various slots, each with a spin value between 0.10 and 1 Euro. Then, in the early morning of February 2, I bought free spins for 50 Euros in the slot game "Money Train 2." This purchase had a spin value of 0.50 Euros, and I managed to land a win of x10366.</p>
<p>I continued to play (never exceeding a round value of 4 Euros). I then initiated a payout of around 3050 Euros and continued to play. As a result, I had a pending payout of 3050 Euros and still had 2700 Euros in my account.</p>
<p>However, when I checked my email address later in the afternoon, I found an email from Luckyblock's support. My payout had been cancelled on the grounds of violating bonus conditions. I checked my customer account and saw that the account balance was 0 Euros, meaning my total of 5700 Euros had just been "deleted." I immediately contacted their support, and they said the decision was irreversible and the money was gone.</p>
<p>I find this absolutely unacceptable and blatant. The bonus conditions state that no stake of more than 5 Euros can be placed, which I have not done, as my spins had round values between 0.10 and 1 Euro. To be honest, I feel cheated and will never play at this casino again. It is definitely not a recommendation, and the support service is a disaster.</p>
<p>I have been with this casino since the very beginning, and even from the presale of their cryptocurrency. I even purchased an NFT for 1500 Euros when it first came out, and now this? I am done with Luck Block and I will make sure to share my experience with everyone.</p>
