    <h1>Drake Casino Login Blue Chip Casino Casino Royale Film Davenport Casino Casino Rentals VGCCC orders</h1>

<p>The Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) continues to watch over the regulated gambling market in the state, and a particular focus has been put on one of the gambling venues, Crown Melbourne, which will continue to adapt to new regulatory realities meant to significantly strengthen consumer protection measures that were previously found deficient.</p>
<p>In the latest update issued by the VGCCC, the commission said that it remained as committed as ever to ensure that it minimizes gambling harm and reduces the risk of money laundering across gambling enterprises, and as a direct result of the Royal Commission investigation into Crown. As a result, the VGCCC has issued a new order whereby players who visit Crown Melbourne and wish to play at the electronic gaming machines (EGMs) would need to use the YourPlay pre-commitment system.</p>
<p>YourPlay is a system that essentially expects players to set pre-configured time and spending limits. This way, they are unlikely to go overboard with their gambling, and the casino would have better control over who is spending and how much. The technology should be implemented by the end of the year, the VGCCC confirmed.</p>
<p>Although VGCCC seeks to strengthen consumer protection statewide, Crown Melbourne is in fact the first venue where the system has been implemented as a mandatory prerequisite of play at EGMs. For all other venues in the state, YourPlay will remain a voluntary option that is not obligatory for venues to implement.</p>
<p>As to the Melbourne casino, players who have reached their pre-committed limits would not be able to continue with their gameplay. The VGCCC has also made sure that Crown Melbourne would make it harder for consumers to in fact engage in harmful behavior. Some of the changes that are happening include the removal of unrestricted gaming machines, and the removal of "continuous play" and the implementation of the same spin rate as for all other gaming machines in the state.</p>
<p>Last but not least, a maximum credit limit for Crown Melbourne EGMs has been set at $1,000, a significant reduction forms the previous rate of $9,494. The VGCCC has said that it takes its role in ensuring that problem gambling is minimized very seriously and it continued to enforce the standards that the regulator believes are necessary to ensure the fairness of play and consumer safety.</p>
