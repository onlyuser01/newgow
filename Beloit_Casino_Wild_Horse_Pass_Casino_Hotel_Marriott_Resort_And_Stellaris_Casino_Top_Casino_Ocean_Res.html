<p>Relax Gaming, supplier of online gambling content and iGaming aggregator, announced Friday it entered into distribution partnership deal with online casino operator Roobet. Under the terms of the deal, the market-leading slot portfolio of the content creator company will feature through the platform of the gambling operator in European markets, which allows wagering in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Proprietary and Third-Party Content</p>
<p>Besides the in-house developed titles of Relax Gaming such as the top performing Tumble slot series and recent hit Hellcatraz, Roobet will gain access to the aggregated content from Silver Bullet studio, as well as from the studio partner network Powered By that feature quality studios such as 4ThePlayer, Kalamba Games and Fantasma Games.</p>
<p>The deal Relax Gaming entered into marks another milestone for the content provider, as Roobet is one of the fast-growing casinos that allows its customers to hold player accounts in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The online casino company that offers a wide range of product portfolios from top casino content providers is licensed and regulated by the Government of Curacao.</p>
<p>“Roobet’s plans to transform online gaming with blockchain technology make it an exciting brand to partner with and we are delighted to provide the online casino with our unique blend of original and popular titles primed for the next-generation player.” Daniel Eskola, CCO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>The distribution deal with Roobet will provide a platform for further expansion into regulated markets for Relax Gaming’s content during a period of strong growth for the online B2B iGaming supplier. It demonstrates the appeal of the gaming content among different gambling operators, underscored by fast and seamless integration and business simplicity, Daniel Escola concluded.</p>
<p>Strive for Innovation</p>
<p>From Roobet’s point of view, the partnership deal with Relax Gaming will let it expand on its product offering, adding value to its continuous strive for innovation.</p>
<p>“Roobet is committed to offering something different to the market status quo and partnering with Relax perfectly ties into this strive for innovation. With the range of quality content the supplier offers, combined with the flexibility of its platform and ease of doing business, we are positive this partnership presents great opportunity from all angles.” Matt Duea, Integrations Director, Roobet</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has entered into its 10th year of operation, marking a decade of success, servicing industry’s leading casino operators, supplying its B2B partners with a constantly growing library of proprietary and third-studio games, and allowing for their quick and simple integration.</p>
