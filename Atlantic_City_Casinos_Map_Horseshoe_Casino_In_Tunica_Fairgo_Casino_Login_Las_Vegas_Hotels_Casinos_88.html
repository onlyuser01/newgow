<p>The Monaco Grand Prix of the 2023 Formula 1 season is on the program on Sunday, May 28, at the Circuit de Monaco</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is having a fabulous season, with Sergio Perez looking like the only one who could potentially ruin his plans. Actually, those two are the only drivers to win races in the 2023 season. Maybe it’s time for someone else to get to the top of the podium?</p>

<p>Max Verstappen Looking Unbeatable at the Moment</p>
<p>The Dutchman is the reigning champion of Formula 1, who won 15 F1 events last season. In 2023, he stands a chance to do even better. The guy’s won three of the five races this season, while in the other two, he finished second each time.</p>
<p>Red Bull Racing’s driver is expected to triumph in Monaco as well. Not only is he in top form right now, but Verstappen loves driving in Monte Carlo. In fact, he’s already won this race once. It happened two years ago, while in 2022, he finished third.</p>
<p>He could’ve done better if it wasn’t for a relatively poor performance in the qualifying stage. Verstappen got himself to the No. 4 position in the qualifying classification, but this time, he’ll probably do better.</p>
<p>Another “Freaking Disaster” for Charles Leclerc</p>
<p>Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was the one who got the pole position in the 2022 race. He was doing great until late in the race when a strategic error caused him to drop down to the fourth place. The Monaco-born driver described the situation as a “freaking disaster” at the time.</p>
<p>Some believe it was the pivotal moment of the season – that’s when it became clear that Leclerc won’t be able to catch up with Verstappen in the F1 Drivers’ Championship.</p>
<p>Can he get his revenge in 2023? Probably not. He’s not going great since the start of the season, with his best finish being No. 3 at the Azerbaijan GP. Still, we wouldn’t be surprised if he got onto the podium in his hometown on Sunday.</p>
<p>2023 Monaco Grand Prix Formula 1 Prediction</p>
<p>Max Verstappen will win this race unless a real miracle happens. Unfortunately, bookies know this as well, which is why they’re giving very short odds on the Dutchman. This is why a more lucrative betting option would be to back Charles Leclerc to finish in the Top 3. The odds for this are somewhere in the ballpark of -180.</p>
<p>Picks: Max Verstappen to win; Charles Leclerc podium finish</p>
