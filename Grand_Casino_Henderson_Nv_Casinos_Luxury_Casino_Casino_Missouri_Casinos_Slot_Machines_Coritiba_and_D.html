<p>Kasper Trier, Dafabet’s International Executive Director, said that the company is excited to be a part of the flourishing online gaming and betting industry in Brazil. Moreover, he pointed out that the extended collaboration with Coritiba reaffirms Dafabet’s “commitment to Brazil, the club and the Coxa fans.” Last but not least, Trier said that the sponsorship extension will help the company and the team achieve important goals throughout 2023.</p>

<p>Dafabet’s head of sponsorships, John Cruces, added that the company is delighted to extend its successful collaboration with Coritiba FC. Additionally, he pointed out that the collaboration further boosts Dafabet’s plan for growth in the country. In conclusion, Cruces wished the team the best of luck in 2023.</p>
<p>“The renewal with Dafabet is part of the club’s new policy of prioritizing the sponsors that are already with us.“ Glenn Stenger, president of Coritiba FC</p>
