    <h1>Casino In Vicksburg Ms Golden Nugget Las Vegas Hotel Casino Penn Casinos Monarch Casino Casino Heist</h1>

<p>The short version:</p>
<p>After a 100% bonus of over 50 euros for my second deposit, I managed to earn just under 7,300 euros, which I was denied the next day.</p>
<p>The following reasons in the chat conversations followed:</p>
<p>1) My bonus is only valid for a maxi win of 50 euros.</p>
<p>Wrong: 40 times wagering requirements. I quickly proved it by email.</p>
<p>2) Then I violated the bonus rules and played with a 75 Eurospin book of dead. Only a maximum of 50 euros is generally possible on the site, the next lie.</p>
<p>When I was able to prove that, the 3rd and final reason was "exceeding the maximum bet".</p>
<p>At slots maxbet 5 euros was specified. Live casino A maximum of 12 euros. I have never exceeded both, but I am also denied gaming history after repeated requests, although the case is closed for them.</p>
<p>Another reason was that I switched from a "low weighted game" to a "high weighted game" and that after "large wins", which I never had in a low game. The big win was at Danger High Voltage and nowhere else and of course that counts as high weight. The official reason in the payment history is still the exceeding of the 5 Euro Max rule for slots, which certainly didn't happen to me.</p>
<p>After repeated threatening bears about the publication of this mess, I was held out for more than 2 weeks in which I was promised to look at the case again until the final "sry, final decision"</p>
<p>Hence an absolute rip-off, lie and deception and a total arbitrariness that you can not only read from me.</p>
<p>Hands off!</p>
