<p>Entain’s pay between male and female employees in the business in 2020 is below the UK average, according to the company’s recent gender pay gap report.</p>
<p>Gender Parity in Retail Business Beneficial for Low Pay Gap</p>
<p>The sports betting and gambling company announced its median hourly pay gap for 2020 is 7.1%, which is lower than the national average of 15.5%. The British operator added this figure is due to the gender parity in its retail business. Additionally, the median bonus gap amounts to 13%.</p>
<p>The company’s report also says that the low gender pay gap has been achieved due to the high female representation, particularly in its Ladbrokes Coral retail estate business, where female employees are 54% of the whole staff. The main factor behind the bonus gap is the delayed payments to office and stadia unit employees in 2019.</p>
<p>The FTSE100 firm highlighted its leading position in terms of inclusion, but also said it is making efforts to do even better. The company released its diversity and inclusion strategy in 2018, with a three-year plan towards creating a more inclusive business.</p>
<p>The four key areas for improvement set out in this year’s report are hiring and attraction, people development, awareness and education, as well as inclusive policy and process. As part of the efforts focused on these key areas, the company attracted top female talent through networking, referrals, and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Last year, Entain also concluded its first ‘Horizon: Senior Women in Leadership Programme’, which gives 250 female industry executives the opportunity to tackle global parity hurdles.</p>
<p>“Our ambition is to make sure Everyone’s In The Game meaning everyone here at Entain feels valued, respected and included. Inclusion is embedded in everything we do, because we know when we feel respected and heard we do our best work.”</p>
<p>Jette Nygaard-Andersen Entain PLC CEO</p>
<p>First Female CEO Appointed in 2021</p>
<p>Recently, Entain announced the appointment of Sandeep Tiku as a permanent member of the board after he served as the Group CTO for four years and then transitioned to Group COO in July last year. With this promotion, the company will meet its target of having at least one ethnic minority representative by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>In January, the company welcomed onboard its first female chief executive, Jette Nygaard-Andersen. She was appointed as non-executive director of Entain in 2019 and has been present during the transformation of Entain from GVC Holdings.</p>
