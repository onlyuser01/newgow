    <h1>Rising Star Casino Resort Rising Sun Gila River Resort And Casino Ilani Casino Events Twin River Cas</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>it is best to start at the beginning of the problem. On 06/11/21, I deposited 100 euros with an exclusive 300% bonus. After a few minutes I received the € 300 bonus.</p>
<p>After playing for a while, I noticed that my wagerbar cannot be right at all. (Well noticed, I have completely adhered to all guidelines and rules). I only bet about 10% per spin. This has always varied. At some point I was at a point where my wager from € 1,600 per spin kept going down instead of up. At the latest then it was clear to me that what was going wrong there. At the time, I already had € 2000.</p>
<p>Without clarifying the problem, I didn't want to continue playing for the time being and waited for the next day to visit the live chat.</p>
<p>In order to shorten the whole thing a bit, I was assured the next day that the wager is completely incorrect (it should have already weighed about 4k) and that it is still being processed, now I've been waiting for this to happen for 5 days. Every day I asked several times in the chat. I was always put off that this was still being processed. Meanwhile I have to assume that I will be deliberately delayed. My bonus expires on 06/17/21. After that, I have no more chance of taking my winnings as long as the wager is not adjusted.</p>
<p>For information ! I was informed that this problem has occurred with some customers and the team is still consulting.</p>
<p>I am very desperate because I am already at € 3,200 and I have little hope of success. I hope I can be helped by your help so that I may still get my winnings, as these are absolutely mine. I have read the guidelines several times and carefully.</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>
<p>Louis B ***</p>
