<p>Chelsea is 2-0 on aggregate against Real Madrid, but Frank Lampard’s boys have a chance to make things interesting on Tuesday, April 18, when they welcome Los Blancos at Stamford Bridge</p>
<p>Things aren’t looking great for Chelsea after losing 2-0 in Madrid. The London Blues now need to beat the reigning UCL champs by two goals just to take the game to extra time. Considering how turbulent the last couple of weeks have been for them, such a thing looks improbable. Oddsmakers agree, which is why they’re giving just -1250 on Real Madrid advancing to the semifinal. Let’s see if the boys from London can ruin their plans.</p>

<p>It’s Ideal Time for Chelsea to End Its Horrible Run</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the team from London is without a win in their last five games in all competitions with a record of 0-2-3 and a score differential of 2-7. Two of those losses happened with Frank Lampard in charge of Chelsea. His second stint as the boss of the Blues came after the club owners decided to sack Graham Potter.</p>
<p>On his second debut as Chelsea manager, Lampard saw his men lose 1-0 to Wolves in Wolverhampton. His second game was against Real Madrid, in which his team lost 2-0. The Blues have to play one game over the weekend in the Prem, but you can be certain that their main focus is the match happening on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It’s the second leg of the doubleheader with Real Madrid, and they need to win it by two or more goals. They might be out of form, but they do have a really strong squad, especially now that most of their key men have returned to fitness, including N’golo Kante, Raheem Sterling, and others.</p>
<p>Los Blancos are UCL Champions for a Reason</p>
<p>In Leg 1, Real Madrid won 2-0, but it could’ve been much worse for Chelsea. The thing is that the Spanish team had 10 more goal attempts than Chelsea, and if it weren’t for Kepa Arrizabalaga’s good performance, Real Madrid would’ve scored more than two.</p>
<p>Sure, we mustn’t forget that Chelsea was a man down since 59th minute when Ben Chilwell got red-carded, but by that point, Real Madrid had already had a 1-0 lead thanks to Karim Benzema’s goal on Vinicius Junior’s assist. The Brazilian forward recorded another assist later in the game, when the scorer was Marco Asensio.</p>
<p>Vini Jr. was the man of the match, and we think he’s going to have a brilliant day at Stamford Bridge as well. It’s just that Chelsea is the team that needs to attack, which will allow him to carry out lightning-fast counterattacks.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs. Real Madrid Prediction</p>
<p>Lampard’s men have no other option but to try and attack. They do have what it takes to score a goal, but we really doubt they can keep their net intact. They might win, but it looks practically impossible for Chelsea to get to the next stage of the competition.</p>
<p>Pick: Chelsea to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
