<p>The generous donation follows Hard Rock Atlantic City's special holiday campaign, "12 days of Giving," reaffirming the resort's dedication to helping charities across the state</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s go-to entertainment and casino destination, Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City, celebrated the holiday season with a special campaign that helped raise funds for different local organizations. The initiative, called “12 days of Giving,” saw the resort donate $100,000 to organizations across the state.</p>
<p>Among the recipients of the donation are the Salvation Army, CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates), Community Food Bank of New Jersey, Live to Serve and ARC of Atlantic County, among others within a long list.</p>
<p>Back in November, Hard Rock Atlantic City collaborated with the Salvation Army. At the time, the casino resort helped them with the organization of their 2023 Thanksgiving holiday meal by delivering meal supplies. Moreover, Hard Rock Atlantic City team members volunteered to help with the serving of the meals at the time.</p>
<p>As noted, CASA is another recipient of Hard Rock’s generous donation. Supporting the organization, the casino resort participated in its seventh annual Deck the Hall Festival of Trees.</p>
<p>The Community Food Bank of New Jersey’s initiative, Operation Help, was kicked off by Hard Rock Atlantic City with the resort hosting its event on November 21, 2023. At the time, Hard Rock Atlantic City received food donations, exchanging them for different prizes, helping the organization’s noble goal. Near the end of the aforementioned event, Michael Sampson, Hard Rock Atlantic City’s general manager and George Goldhoff, the venue’s president, made a $10,000 donation to the Community Food Bank of New Jersey.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Employees Show Generosity</p>
<p>Initially, Hard Rock’s Atlantic City property opened its doors to visitors in 2018. Since then, Hard Rock Atlantic City helped more than 500 charities by providing vital donations, supporting a wide range of initiatives and volunteering.</p>
<p>“I am grateful to our Team Members for their generosity, their spirit of volunteerism and their commitment to supporting our ‘12 Days of Giving’ program.“ George Goldhoff, president of Hard Rock Atlantic City</p>
<p>Goldhoff was excited about the donation the resort made to local organizations. He thanked Hard Rock’s team members for their commitment, support and generosity to the “12 days of Giving” initiative. Finally, Goldhoff said that the resort’s employees showed dedication to “Love All-Serve All,” one of the company’s core commitments.</p>
