<p>Playgon Games Inc. has signed a new distribution agreement with EveryMatrix, a company that specializes in the aggregation and delivery of cutting-edge content for the online casino industry. Through this new partnership, EveryMatrix will add Playgon’s own mobile-first live dealer and eTable game offerings available through the VegasLounge brand.</p>
<p>Playgon to Get Content Distribution Springboard with EveryMatrix</p>
<p>As a result, EveryMatrix will be able to provide its global network of clients with a range of titles that are expected to generate robust interest and elicit a strong response from players.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership opportunity, Playgon Games CEO and president Darcy Krogh welcomed the chance to be teaming up with a leading distributor of content, which will allow Playgon to leverage its own live dealer products and expertise. Krogh added:</p>
<p>This relationship with a top-tier aggregator will give our Company extensive reach in highly lucrative key markets through one integration, and we expect it will play a significant role in our revenue growth. Playgon Games CEO and president Darcy Krogh</p>
<p>Krogh confirmed that Playgon’s products are beginning to receive interest from leading operators in the industry and the EveryMatrix tie-up will only expedite this process and help boost awareness for the company’s unique iGaming proposition. EveryMatrix CasinoEngine COO Amund Stensland argued that the company was more than happy to see Playgon’s live dealer games enter the distribution platform.</p>
<p>CasinoEngine, which is EveryMatrix’s distribution platform, has the means necessary to guarantee quick market entry and help promising and innovative companies such as Playgon reach new audiences without issues.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix is a powerful ally for Playgon as it already works with more than 200 customers worldwide and is regulated to operate in multiple prominent jurisdictions, including many individual markets in the United States, giving partners access to numerous opportunities to bring their products to market with prominent brands in the most frictionless way possible.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix has been posting solid results across the board with the Q3 performance markers exceeding expectations. In November, EveryMatrix added 3 Oaks Gaming to CasinoEngine.</p>
