    <h1>Rolling Hills Casino What To Do At A Casino Hotels Near Pechanga Casino Temecula Ca Peppermill Resor</h1>

<p>DWG’s team has spent a lot of time honing this launch to suit the specifics of the Pennsylvanian market</p>
<p>Design Works Gaming (DWG), a supplier and developer of premier casino content, has further expanded its existing relationship with the entertainment giant Rush Street Interactive (RSI). Under a new deal, the former entity agreed to supply the operator’s business in Pennsylvania with a selection of games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new arrangement, RSI will be able to provide some of DWG’s best games to players in the Keystone State. RSI gamblers will be the first in Pennsylvania to have access to DWG’s premium LuckyTap titles and excellent slots, including Molten Hot 7s.</p>
<p>The content will become available to customers of RSI’s BetRivers brand through Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming aggregation platform. As agreed by RSI and DWG, more content will be added to the operator’s portfolio over the following few weeks.</p>
<p>The deal follows another agreement that saw the two companies expand their content deal to Michigan. This allowed customers in the latter state to enjoy fan-favorite games such as Break the Bounty LuckyTap, 10X Fortune and Double Fancy 7s.</p>
<p>CEO Zurawski Is Happy to Expand DWG’s Relationship with RSI</p>
<p>DWG’s founder and chief executive officer, Troy Zurawski, commented on the launch with RSI. He said that his team has spent a lot of time honing this launch to suit the specifics of the Pennsylvanian market.</p>
<p>Our team has poured countless hours of hard work and expertise into understanding the intricacies of the Pennsylvania market, meticulously crafting our roadmaps to meet the specific needs and preferences of the BetRivers players in this dynamic region. Troy Zurawski, founder &amp; CEO, DWG</p>
<p>Zurawski added that RSI is a well-respected operator in the state. Pennsylvania as a whole has a huge potential for DWG, which is why his team is bullish on making a lasting impact. Zurawski said that his team is very happy with the partnership it has with RSI in other states and is looking forward to “pushing the boundaries of innovation and delivering the excitement that Pennsylvania players crave.”</p>
<p>The CEO concluded that he wants to thank the RSI team and everyone involved in this agreement.</p>
<p>A huge thank you to Zachary Salem, Kathryn Lazarowich, Cristian Blanco and the entire RSI team! Troy Zurawski, founder &amp; CEO, DWG</p>
<p>RSI Pennsylvania recently added content from Bragg Gaming Group to its portfolio, further cementing its leadership position in the region. Prior to that, the operator onboarded content from White Hat Gaming, injecting more games into BetRivers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
