    <h1>Desert Diamond Casino Entertainment Tucson Big M Casino Little River Sc Pulsz Casino Real Money Gold</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Videoslots casino blocked access to my account on December 6, 2023, and sent me an email requesting proof of my wealth sources. I submitted all the necessary documents, and now the casino is asking for bank statements from people who have transferred money to me. How am I possibly going to get access to other people's bank statements? Despite already explaining that I am self-employed, and having also provided them with my bank statements and investment accounts, they are still claiming it is not possible for me to meet my wagering level. Despite their requests for payroll receipts, I have repeated that I work for myself – it appears they are not reasoning logically. I await your assistance, thank you. Please find attached the email they sent to me.</p>
<p>We hope you are enjoying playing on our website.</p>

<ul>
