<p>The Rave review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Rave is themed around an underground dance party.</p>
<p>Players will enter a crowded warehouse pulsing with music and colorful flashing lights. As the beat picks up, they’ll jive with a few hundred eccentric partiers.</p>
<p>This slot is a good choice for players longing to escape into a world of electronic melodies and playful outfits.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The electronic soundtrack has a rhythmic beat interspersed with ominous vocalizations. Players will feel ready to give in and dance all night as layers of percussion are added to the mix. Though the mute button is available, this slot’s soundtrack is essential to its party atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the reels, lollipops, headphones, and a variety of unique characters appear. Each partier is dressed to impress, sporting glowing necklaces, rainbow dreadlocks, and reflective sunglasses.</p>
<p>The characters are not particularly glamorous, with some even appearing a little disheveled and silly. This suggests a realistic experience of a rave rather than an idealized one.</p>
<p>Players will see a crowded rave beyond the reels, the flashing pink and violet lights adding to the otherworldly vibe. The animation of the backdrop is deliberately blurred, furthering the feeling that players are under the influence in a disorienting setting.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and particularly the music make The Rave an engrossing all night party.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Rave is a five reel, three row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>In total, The Rave has 243 ways to win.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol may land on any reel, and when players land 2 Scatters, this activates the symbols to become Enhancer Cells.</p>
<p>During the base game, the Enhancer Cells land one of the following symbols: xWays symbols, xSplit Wild symbols, Wild symbols, or high paying Character symbols.</p>
<p>The xWays symbol reveals 2-6 matching symbols and expands the reels' height. If more than one xWays symbol lands, they will reveal matching symbols.</p>
<p>The xSplit Wild splits every symbol on the reel, doubling the number of available symbols. It also splits itself into two Wild symbols.</p>
<p>The xBet feature allows players to opt to increase their bet by 20% in order to guarantee a Scatter symbol on the second reel.</p>
<p>When players land 2 xWays symbols on the same reel, an expanded xWays Wild will form across that reel. The stacked Wild may have between 6 and 11 Wild symbols in total.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature begins with 7 free spins and 3 Enhancer Cells. If the Free Spins feature is triggered by 4 Scatter symbols, 8 free spins and 4 Enhancer Cells are awarded. A multiplier on reels 2, 3, and 4 can be activated when players land a character symbol in the Enhancer Cells.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, additional special bonuses can be triggered at random. This includes the transformation of all character symbols into the highest paying symbols, and the transformation of all low paying symbols into Wilds on randomly selected reels.</p>
<p>The God is a DJ bonus is triggered when players land 5 Scatters, beginning with 10 free spins. During this feature, 5 Enhancer Cells are active, and players are guaranteed that an additional special bonus will be triggered.</p>
