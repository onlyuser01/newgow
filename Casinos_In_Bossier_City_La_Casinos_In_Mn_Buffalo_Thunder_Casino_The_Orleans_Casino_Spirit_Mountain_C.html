    <h1>Casinos In Bossier City La Casinos In Mn Buffalo Thunder Casino The Orleans Casino Spirit Mountain C</h1>

<p>I'm not a smartass, I'm just stating my opinion. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>There are thousands of licensed casinos and yet addicted people play there every day.</p>
<p>And when the addict realizes that he cannot play on a certain site, he simply chooses one of the other tens of thousands of casinos and plays there.</p>
<p>I totally agree with you that addicts should be helped.</p>
<p>But that's not how you help an addict.</p>
<p>I grew up on the streets and know dozens of addicts who have not benefited from all these therapies.</p>
<p>On the contrary, some were much worse afterwards. Everything was fine for a month and then everything started all over again. Then came the 0815 standard therapy that you do with everyone and the game goes on until many even take their own lives.</p>
<p>You treat them and then most of them relapse again. How come? Because it is NOT about the gambling addiction in the first place. This is not an addiction game!! This person has completely different psychological problems, such as being very lonely or not feeling loved, having no one to stand by him. Such things are what drive people into addiction, desperation to live and addiction .. It doesn't matter whether the drug addiction is game addiction, they just want to flee and build up an addiction that does them more harm.</p>
<p>My experience is that these people lack love and no therapy that is already used daily as a standard program and most of the addicts already see them as a number and for most it becomes so commonplace that they don't even deal with the real problem and then wondering why it didn't work</p>
<p>They don't play because they are addicted to games. Just like drug addicts don't take drugs because they're so happy and they enjoy it.. they take it as a run away from reality even though most of them don't want the stuff and tell themselves on a daily basis that they want to stop but can't because her psyche is broken.</p>
<p>Please don't get me wrong but this kind of help offered to the gambling addict is not helpful.</p>
<p>If you really want to help such people, it costs a lot of money that most people don't want to carry!!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're addicted to gambling or drugs or whatever addiction you have should always be treated with love.</p>
<p>Take 10 addicts and put them all on a nice piece of land with lots of animals so that they are in nature and take care of the animals and get out of this addiction.</p>
<p>You have to show them the beautiful and the love and not a pre-printed therapy that you go through like a number because that's how it's written.</p>
<p>I don't think much of all this help and I don't mean that in a bad way.</p>
<p>2 friends of mine took their own lives. One was 23 and the other 28...they've both been in therapy so often I can't remember how often.</p>
<p>Nothing helped. How come? Because they were mistreated.</p>
<p>I don't know if you understand me, but such problems can only be solved with profundity and love.</p>
<p>In the first place, addicts are only addicts because they can't handle life.</p>
<p>It's like our school system. Put 40 little energetic beings in a room and teach all 40 the same thing although each of these individual individuals have different strengths and then some feel stupid because they don't understand what they are being taught because their strengths lie somewhere else.</p>
<p>That's how it is in my opinion with the therapies.</p>
<p>Everything has been so standardized over the years that there are only numbers and no souls.</p>
<p>It's my opinion and it always has been.</p>
