<p>Thiago Santos Stats Johnny Walker 37 Age 29 6’2″ Height 6’6″ 76″ Reach 82″ 21-9-0 Record 18-5-0</p>
<p>Walker Faces Goods Odds to Dethrone Santos</p>
<p>Santos’ name always makes a buzz in the MMA world. Whenever he fights, fans come out to watch and this is a fact. That is why Walker will look to secure a win against him leaving as little to chance as possible. Even though he is posted as the underdog at (+150), that is hardly a huge gap between the odds.</p>
<p>To put things into perspective, Santos has not had a good run recently. He has lost three of his last four fights, facing off with Aleksandar Rakic, Glover Teixeira, and Jon Jones. Two of those were lost by decision, and Teixeira managed to submit Marreta. So, will Santos be looking for a comeback?</p>
<p>He most certainly would be. Yet, here is Walker’s shot to shine. He has only lost two of his seven appearances in the UFC although he is on the whole less experienced than Santos. That is precisely where the rub lies. Walker is also still letting his guard down on occasion, which has exposed him to some injury over the last fights.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Walker brings in better overall physical attributes. He’s taller than Santos (6’6″) and has a considerably better reach (82″). However, he has only gone the distance twice in UFC fights, whereas even in his losses, Santos has been able to show a presence of mind and body and last in fights.</p>
<p>When Teixeira submitted him, Santos was very close to KO’ing the man as well. There are many reasons why you would want to go with Walker for this one on the moneyline, but Santos does offer some excellent overall potential.</p>
<p>Santos seems to have the better overall showing in the UFC, but we believe Walker has what it takes to bring a win home. He will have to show confidence and grit to close the odds gap to the benefit of everyone who has backed him on the moneyline.</p>
