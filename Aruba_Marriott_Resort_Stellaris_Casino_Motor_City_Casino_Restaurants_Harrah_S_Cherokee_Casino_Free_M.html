<p>1X2 Network’s new brand Iron Dog Studio has expanded its palette of custom games with Vegas Dice Megaways. The new game was created with the help of Belgian partner Napoleon Games. The video slot was built using the developer’s exclusive Branded Megaways foundation that serves the bespoke needs of operators. Players can expect a one-of-a-kind dice slot with a huge win potential.</p>

<p>Vegas Dice Megaways is a 6-reel video slot game with a rich selection of features that add to the solid core gameplay that Megaways titles are popular for. The game was designed with the help of the Branded Megaways template. This foundation is used by operators to add their own backgrounds, logos, or reel colors to a slot for a completely bespoke gaming experience for players. The new game invites players to spend a crazy night in Las Vegas. All they need to do is watch the dice spin on the reels while listening to the upbeat soundtrack with a stunning bass guitar that will have them instantly hooked. The action takes place on a 6-reel grid. Each of the reels holds between two and seven symbols. In turn, this can trigger between 64 and 117,649 ways to win. To win, players must match symbols in adjacent reels starting with the leftmost position.</p>
<p>As expected, the main symbols in the game are represented by dice. Dice showing 1 through 6 are the low-paying symbols. The high-paying symbols are represented by three Asian characters throwing dice, along with a Lucky 7 dice. Players who land a mix of six matching symbols are rewarded with a payout worth between 0.6x and 2x the initial bet for low-paying symbols and between 2x and 25x for high-paying symbols.</p>
<p>The game also features wilds represented by wild dice symbols popping on all reels except for the first one. The wilds can be used to replace any other symbol. Once a wild lands with an x2 multiplier during a win, the values automatically multiply one another.</p>
<p>The Bonus Upgrader Feature</p>
<p>There are 14 free spins that can be randomly triggered during the base game once a minimum of four consecutive tumbles take place. However, players can also buy free spins using the Bonus Upgrader feature. This allows them to purchase the free spins in various increments, starting with six up to ten free spins. Free spins prices range from 30x the initial bet for six spins and no locked reel for an RTP of 95.79% to 130x the original bet for 10 free spins with one starting locked reel and an RTP of 96.07%. During the base game, players can also trigger two extra features that will supercharge the game’s win potential.</p>
<p>Napoleon Gaming’s gaming content manager Melissa Deboelpael called the success of the partnership with 1×2 Network a “no-brainer.” Account manager and marketing director for 1×2 Network Rory Kimber said the new game once again proves why many popular casino operators are looking forward to working with them to boost their portfolios. In February, RANT and 1X2 Network launched their first Branded Megaways slot. At the end of May, 1×2 Network introduced its Arcade Games portfolio with a strong focus on skill games.</p>
