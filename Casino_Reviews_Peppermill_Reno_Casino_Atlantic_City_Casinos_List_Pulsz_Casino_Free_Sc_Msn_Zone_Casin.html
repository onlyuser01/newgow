<p>Kansspelautoriteit (KSA)</p>
<p>The Kansspelautoriteit, or Dutch Gaming Authority, was formed on 1st April 2012 with three core objectives - to protect consumers, to prevent gambling addiction, and to combat illegal practices. It is an independent body which implements and enforces the Dutch Gambling Act 2021 (KOA) on behalf of the Minister for Legal Protection. In pursuit of perfection The KSA states that it "strives for a world in which games of chance are reliable, providers are transparent and players are protected" - a noble cause indeed. To achieve this the authority has prescribed itself several statutory tasks: To regulate the market - by granting licenses and ensuring that the conditions of those licenses are met</p>
<p>To supervise - by making sure that all laws and regulations are followed to the letter</p>
<p>To enforce - by taking action against any illegal gambling activity</p>
<p>To prevent addiction - by ensuring licensees are implementing robust controls and promoting awareness of gambling risks</p>
<p>To inform and educate - by making available information to players and operators and answering any questions</p>
<p>To combat match-fixing among sports betting license holders</p>
<p>To provide a way for players to exclude themselves from gambling By the application of tight measures and strict controls, the KSA can be certain that only reputable companies can operate in the Dutch market.</p>
<p>Complaints The KSA states that if players encounter problems with an operator such as operating without a license, not paying winnings, allowing underage gambling or partaking in fraud, they should report this to the authority. The authority will use such reports to determine if further investigation is warranted. However, it will not mediate disputes between players and operators, and recommends players to: Discuss the matter with the operator directly</p>
<p>Contact a complaints officer or a legal advisor</p>
<p>Report fraud to the police Once the report has been made, the player will only hear from the authority if more information is required. The results of any investigations based upon player reports can be viewed on the Your report, our supervision page. How to check a license All licensed gambling sites should display a KSA logo at the bottom of the page to show that they are legitimate, but it is safer to take this one step further and check the list of approved gambling licensees, also known as the Gambling Guide. the list of approved gambling licensees Information provided here includes the type of license held by the company and how long it is valid, the websites they operate and their contact address.</p>
