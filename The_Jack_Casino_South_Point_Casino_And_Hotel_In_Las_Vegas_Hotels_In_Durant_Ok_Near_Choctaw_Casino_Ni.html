<p>Liverpool vs. Arsenal is a duel between the two top teams in the 2023-24 Premier League standings</p>
<p>Arsenal is sitting at the top of the Premier League with 39 points. Liverpool is just behind with one point fewer. What this means is that whoever wins Saturdayâ€™s game at Anfield in Liverpool will get to the summit of the EPL table.</p>
<p>But what if the game finishes in a draw? In that case, we could see Aston Villa get to the top, assuming that the boys from Birmingham are going to beat the bottom-placed Sheffield United on Friday.</p>

<p>Liverpool to Make Use of Anfield Power</p>
<p>The Reds are undefeated at home in the 2023-24 Premier League. Their record at Anfield is 7-1-0, with their only draw happening last weekend when they played 0-0 with Manchester United.</p>
<p>It was a strange game, in which they were the dominant side, keeping the ball in their possession for more than two-thirds of the time. Further, they made 34 goal attempts, while Man United made only 6.</p>
<p>ðŸ—£ "We tried everything."</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp admits Liverpool should have hit the target more in their 0-0 draw with Manchester United ðŸŽ¯ðŸ¥… pic.twitter.com/j0MJE7DZll â€” Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) December 18, 2023</p>
<p>That said, Jurgen Kloppâ€™s men were the better team, but luck wasnâ€™t on their side. Will they do better this time?</p>
<p>They have every right to hope for a better result, given that they have a very good history with Arsenal, especially in games played in Liverpool. Itâ€™s been more than 11 years since they suffered a home loss to the Gunners.</p>
<p>Arsenal Coming to Anfield to Win Points</p>
<p>Losing Saturdayâ€™s game could mean dropping from the first to the third spot in the Premier League. A draw would (probably mean) getting to second place, while a win would cement the Gunners to the top of the Prem.</p>
<p>You can be 100% certain that Mikel Artetaâ€™s men wish to win this game, but do they have the quality to do so? Well, they did beat Manchester City in October, but they didnâ€™t do as well against other heavyweights, especially not in away matches. For example, their most recent loss happened to Aston Villa in Birmingham.</p>
<p>On the bright side, in their most recent EPL game, the Gunners beat Brighton 2-0. But that game was played in London. The one on Saturday is played in Liverpool.</p>
<p>The reason why this should worry Arsenalâ€™s fans is that the Gunners lost two of their last four league games on the road.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs. Arsenal Prediction</p>
<p>Quality-wise, these two are very similar. Even their score differential is almost identical, with Liverpool having scored just one goal more than Arsenal. Still, we think that home support will be a crucial factor in this game.</p>
<p>Played just two days before Christmas, the Liverpool vs. Arsenal game is bound to bring the best out of fans at Anfield. And most of them will be rooting passionately for the Reds.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool &amp; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
