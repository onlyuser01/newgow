<p>Winter said that GNOG’s achievements take second place to the incredible time he has had with the passionate people working in the casino industry</p>
<p>Thomas Winter, DraftKings North America’s general manager, announced his departure from the company, citing the need for more personal time as the reason.</p>
<p>Having founded Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG), now owned by DraftKings, Winter has had a lot of good years as a key player in the gambling industry. After leading GNOG for a decade, however, Winter believes it is time to step down.</p>
<p>In a LinkedIn post, the outgoing general manager spoke about the reason for his departure. He said:</p>
<p>Ten years after founding Golden Nugget Online Gaming, three years after taking it public and two years after its acquisition by the almighty DraftKings, time has come for me to close this extraordinary chapter of my life and open a new one, this time focused on the latter part of work-life balance. Thomas Winter, outgoing general manager, DraftKings</p>
<p>Reminiscing about his time in the gambling industry, Winter said that he feels very proud to have taken GNOG from dead last to the number 1 online casino in New Jersey. His achievements also include the opening of the first live dealer studio in America and having GNOG being voted Casino Operator of the Year 4 years in a row.</p>
<p>Winter is also delighted that he turned GNOG into a publicly traded company, allowing it to be acquired by “the almighty DraftKings.”</p>
<p>Winter Met a Lot of Amazing People in the Industry</p>
<p>Winter said that GNOG’s achievements take second place to the incredible time he has had with the passionate people working in the casino industry. He tagged some of his best friends in gambling, thanking them for their incredible support.</p>
<p>Winter admitted that he will probably “miss the action.” Despite that, he is certain that DraftKings and GNOG are in good hands and will continue to deliver results.</p>
<p>Although I’ll miss the action, I can’t wait to see what the amazing DK/GNOG casino team, led by uber-talented Gregory Karamitis and superstar Signe Yama, will deliver to stay atop the US iGaming world for years to come. I’ll be rooting for y’all. Thomas Winter, outgoing general manager, DraftKings</p>
<p>Winter founded GNOG in 2013. The company became the top gaming operator in New Jersey in 2018 and went public two years later. A year after going live on the Nasdaq, GNOG was acquired by DraftKings in a historic $1.5 billion deal.</p>
