<p>Push Gaming, a B2B developer of content for the iGaming industry, has announced that it is entering the regulated market in Switzerland through a local partnership with Grand Casino Luzern.</p>
<p>This will allow both partners to benefit with Grand Casino Luzern repeatedly expanding its offer with world class suppliers over the past year and introducing a variety of trusted and reliable suppliers of the highest caliber.</p>
<p>This time, it will be Push Gaming injecting its award-winning and player-favorite content locally, including with titles such as Jammin’ Jars, Wild Swarm, Razor Returns, and many others. One of the latest additions includes Boss Bear, which is only now gaining steam with the iGaming community but is bound to be another hit by the company.</p>
<p>Push Gaming has been steadily expanding in regulated markets not just in Europe, but also elsewhere in Europe, hoping to drive a more significant interest in its games and brand. The company has pushed in Colombia, but also in other local markets such as Italy and Greece.</p>
<p>Grand Casino Luzern CEO Wolfgang Bliem has welcomed this opportunity and praised Push Gaming’s captivating slots. Thanks to this collaboration, the casino is able to consolidate its pole position once again in the iGaming market in the country and provide more high-quality and innovative gameplay to its players.</p>
<p>"We are ecstatic to exclusively showcase their content on our platform, leading the way in doing so in Switzerland," Bliem said in a statement.</p>
<p>The alliance was met equally well by Push Gaming’s own Fiona Hickey, who confirmed that her company was equally excited to be making this ground-breaking move into the Swiss iGaming market.</p>
<p>"The operator’s leading position within Switzerland will allow our fan favorite titles to reach a vast audience and aid in further growth within the market thereafter. We are excited to see players’ reception to our unique content," Hickey added.</p>
<p>Push Gaming has also been building elsewhere in Europe. In November, the supplier announced a partnership with Fair Play Casino in the Netherlands, further pushing in regulated and challenging markets across the continent.</p>
<p>The company has been able to add more significant and prominent operators from the continent, including Novibet in October, and making a groundbreaking move in Greece in September through an alliance with Kaizen Gaming.</p>
<p>The most recent alliance with Grand Casino Luzern consolidates Push Gaming’s ambition to continue pushing with new brands across the world.</p>
