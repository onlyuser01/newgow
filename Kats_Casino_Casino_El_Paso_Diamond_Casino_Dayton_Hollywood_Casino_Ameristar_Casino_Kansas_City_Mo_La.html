<p>Rolling out BetBuilder to Ladbrokes bettors is a “great next step” for everyone involved, Ladbrokes’s trading director said</p>
<p>Real-time esports statistics &amp; odds provider PandaScore has agreed to supply its longtime partner Ladbrokes Australia with the fresh BetBuilder product. The Entain-owned operator will thus be able to satisfy the needs of esports punters.</p>
<p>As agreed, the Australian gambling brand will integrate the esports-oriented BetBuilder into its offering right ahead of the BLAST Paris Major, one of the biggest Counter-Strike: Global Offensive events for 2023.</p>
<p>BetBuilder will provide Ladbrokes Australia with engaging betting opportunities for CS:GO and Dota 2. The product leverages the company’s game-specific models, providing fans with new ways to wager on their favorite leagues.</p>
<p>The solution is backed by robust data drawn from multiple resources. Its addition to Ladbrokes’ platform is the natural next step in the partnership between the operator and PandaScore.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes, which has used PandaScore’s Player Props markets for a while, will be able to combine them with the strength of BetBuilder, allowing fans to factor in specific player scorings within their wagers.</p>
<p>Recent studies show that the average esports punter would bet small amounts on multiple events. According to experts, this is not because esports bettors chase the highest returns but because placing multiple wagers on various aspects of a game is more thrilling to fans. As a result, BetBuilder will cater to these fans’ needs, allowing them to combine their various wagers in a single bet.</p>
<p>A Great Next Step for Ladbrokes</p>
<p>PandaScore’s chief executive officer, Flavien Guillocheau, remarked that esports betting continues to grow in popularity. The current partnership, coming just before the Paris Major, is a “key step” for innovation within the esports betting sector, Guillocheau said. He is certain that BetBuilder is exactly the tool the industry wants and needs.</p>
<p>Counter-Strike fans have a fresh, engaging product to try out for the biggest CS:GO tournament of the year, and Ladbrokes Australia has another engaging product to add to the robust esports offering we have been building together for over 3 years now. Flavien Guillocheau, CEO, PandaScore</p>
<p>Don Forbes, Ladbrokes Australia’s trading director, also commented on the agreement. He noted that PandaScore is a trusted partner and added that rolling out BetBuilder to Ladbrokes bettors is a “great next step” for everyone involved.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to rolling this out for what will prove to be a very popular tournament in the Paris Major, and giving our customers an exciting new way to play moving forward,” Forbes said.</p>
