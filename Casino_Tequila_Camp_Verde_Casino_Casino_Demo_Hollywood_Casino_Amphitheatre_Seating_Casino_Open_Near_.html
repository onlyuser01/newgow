    <h1>Casino Tequila Camp Verde Casino Casino Demo Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Seating Casino Open Near</h1>

<p>I have update for this issue. Now they took the withdrawal type (My own bank) off the System so I can not do any withdrawals. I was told from the customer service live chat that the problem is on Zimpler side. Well, I contacted Zimpler and they said that they did not have any problems at the time and they did not have any problems now that im writing this. So this is the first lie from the casino side.</p>
<p>So now they are trying to make me deposit more money so that I can withdraw them because you can only withdraw with the method you’ve deposited with. I will not do this because Zimpler confirmed that the casino support was lying so I can not trust that they do not use this withdrawal rule against me.</p>
<p>Second lie: I’ve been told many times that there are no VIP-levels on the casino. Then every other support service Person tells me that there are VIP-levels and mine lets me withdraw 500€/24h. This is a total lie as their user regulations let users withdraw 1000€/24h whatever the "level" they are. Or actually there are no levels. So another lie, or very incompent personnel ( i have several chat transcripts which i’m happy to send to you with different persons).</p>
<p>3rd lie: they told me my withdrawals are not handled on weekends. Last weekend I did withdrawals on saturday and it was paid to my account with Osuuspankki on Sunday. So they do process and pay these on the weekends also. Now i can not do withdrawals anymore.</p>
<p>so what would you suggest me to do because there is no way for me now to do withdrawals, the support personnel is lying. I can send you all the chat transcript and other data you would need. Still 9000€ withdrawals ongoing with this scamming casino</p>
