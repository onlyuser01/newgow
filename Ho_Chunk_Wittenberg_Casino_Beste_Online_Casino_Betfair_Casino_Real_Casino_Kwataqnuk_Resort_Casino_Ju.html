    <h1>Ho Chunk Wittenberg Casino Beste Online Casino Betfair Casino Real Casino Kwataqnuk Resort Casino Ju</h1>

<p>Juventus and Inter Milan are the two most successful Serie A teams with a total of 55 domestic titles between them. Further, these two are the only teams that have won the Serie A title in the past ten seasons. Actually, Juventus won nine of those before Inter Milan finally put an end to their superb run last year.</p>
<p>The reigning champion still has a good chance to retain the title, but it’s not going to be easy as Juve is determined to ruin Inter’s plans. Plus, there are also AC Milan and Napoli who are dreaming the same dreams. Ahead of Round 31 of the 2021-22 season of Serie A, all four aforementioned teams are in the competition for the title.</p>
<p>With just seven weeks left before the end of the season, every game matters. That said, whoever wins the Juventus vs Inter Milan game on Sunday is going to make one giant leap toward the Serie A trophy. The loser, on the other hand, could end up losing the race. And if the game ends in a draw, both teams would be in trouble.</p>

<p>Juventus Looking for a Way to Salvage the Season</p>
<p>After a shocking 3-0 home loss to Villarreal two weeks ago, Juventus got knocked out of the Champions League. As per some reports, the defeat caused a real uproar in Juve’s locker room, with some players reportedly asking to be traded.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, things settled a few days after the loss, as evident from the fact that Juventus defeated Salernitana 2-0 in Serie A. Sure, beating the bottom-placed team isn’t much of an excitement, but the win did probably serve as a confidence boost to Juve ahead of this week’s challenge.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be easy for them on Sunday, but the black-and-whites need to go for a win. A victory would mean leapfrogging Inter in the #3 position in Serie A standings, as well as getting closer to AC Milan and Napoli.</p>
<p>Injury Troubles for Inter’s Offense</p>
<p>Inter scored a goal in each of their previous three games. Two of those were Serie A games, in which the reigning champion was seen as the betting favorite. Unfortunately for Il Nerazzurri, they drew 1-1 both with Torino and Fiorentina.</p>
<p>As a result, they dropped to the #3 place in the Serie A table. On the bright side, they’ve played one game fewer than the two teams currently sitting above them. The bad news is that taking advantage of that fact isn’t going to be easy. Why? Because in order to win games, Inter players need to start scoring more.</p>
<p>The trouble is that a couple of Inter’s key players are sidelined. Lautaro Martinez, who’s their top scorer in Serie A is out with an illness. Further, Marcelo Brozovic is injured, the same as Matias Vecino.</p>
<p>Juventus vs Inter Prediction</p>
<p>At home, Juventus is without a loss to Inter Milan since 2012. On top of that, Juve is without a home loss in Serie A since November, winning most of the games in-between. With the help of their fans, these guys should be able to get themselves a win, which could prove crucial for their title plans.</p>
<p>Picks: Juventus to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
