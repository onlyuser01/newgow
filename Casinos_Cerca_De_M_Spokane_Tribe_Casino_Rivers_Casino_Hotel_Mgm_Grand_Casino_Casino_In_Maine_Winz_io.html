    <h1>Casinos Cerca De M Spokane Tribe Casino Rivers Casino Hotel Mgm Grand Casino Casino In Maine Winz io</h1>

<p>Thank you I genuinely appreciate your time and efforts.</p>
<p>I registered my account Jan1./23.</p>
<p>I sent all required documents for verification.</p>
<p>I played slots lots of Quickfire games.</p>
<p>I had a $0 balance I believe??</p>
<p>Over the year I have them over $80000.</p>
<p>I was really respectful and understanding to agents about situation after trying to wrap my head around it. They told me to contact Vip manager a month after which would be about Jan.1/24 and I did today Jan.6/24 and they told me I can’t get Vip manager anymore. I went to find emails of all the conversations I had had kept from them and they were all gone from my files. So it appears maybe they blocked me or hacked me. As all the records I saved are gone from my file??</p>
<p>I reached out 2 weeks continually prior to them closing my account about some things I did not feel happy with and like most humans felt unheard and treated poorly as again I trusted this company for a year. I got no response for that 2 weeks. In one morning I woke up to emails from them 1)That I was being welcomed into new VIP program they had created as I was already a VIP but this was a newer version 2) that I had won a prize on lottery 3)That my account was being closed no further discussion.🤯 I respectfully told them I don’t this this is right. They responded that I was trying to black mail them to reopen account by telling them honestly I may have to file a complaint against them for closing my account unfairly. I tried communicating with them over and over and they Just ignored me then acted like cowards and instead of respectfully and maturely communicating with them they closed my account. I always told the chat agents how much I appreciated them and always was a total open book about all things. They showed me very little respect in return. As like I stated before I had saved emails but now mysteriously they all gone??? I saved them for this reason. I respectfully waited the month to not write any negative reviews or file a complaint as like I said the Vip manager told me we can talk in a month. Now they won’t let me talk to manager and treating me like I’m nothing. This is not right. We trust these companies with lots of money and just in a blink of an eye they gaslight and be so manipulative is mind blowing to me. They need to understand we are human and sometimes need to speak up if we are feeling like we are being treated unfairly. They gaslighted me so bad. Made me feel like I did not have a right to say anything and that I was causing stress on them. When all I was trying to do was get some respect and healthy communication about my account. I am really losing trust in this industry and thinking that the whole online casino business is a total shady business. I used to love just playing my slots mindlessly for entertainment. When companies pull things like this it makes me have no trust. They don’t treat people like humans. I don’t know if you help me feel better about all this or do what is right , I don’t know 🤷🏼‍♀️. I just thought I would try to do what is right for us players. As this stuff happens too much to everyday people who are just trying to get a little luck , be treated fairly and have some fun. These companies powertrip take peoples money and drop them as soon as any of us have a voice. Again I really appreciate your time and efforts immensely. ✌️❣️Let me know if you need anything else from me. I don’t have emails from them even though I saved them. So that’s kind of suspicious 🤨 isn’t it?? Not surprised though as this is how these guys seem to operate. 🥸</p>
