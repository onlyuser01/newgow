    <h1>Free No Deposit Bonus Casino Soboba Casino Finger Lakes Casino Racetrack Soaring Eagle Casino Michig</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>unfortunately I have to use your help again. I have on 05/28. requests a withdrawal of € 900. So far I have requested and received 4 withdrawals at this casino. The first payout on July 9th. was difficult but with your help it worked. The other withdrawals were handled without any problems. In response to my request yesterday, I was informed of the following: Having rechecked this with our relevant department please note that we can see deposit that was made with Skrill on 9th of February 2021.</p>
<p>Due to this, our relevant department requested the following documents so your account verification can be completed:</p>
<ul>
<li>proof of deposit for Skrill: a screenshot of the transaction to Condor Gaming, showing the account information (All details should be presented on the same page) Please see the example in the attachment of this email.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, since deposits were made from another person Skrill account, please provide us with the following documents for Juergen E ***:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Personal identification document (front and back); preferably a copy of your passport;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recent (not older than 2 months) bank statement visibly displaying account holder full name, address, IBAN, and date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address verification document ie a copy of a utility bill. The address verification document must be issued within the last 2 months and has to visibly show your name, address, and issue date. (This can be any sort of invoice letter ie phone bill, insurance bill, tax document, payslip document, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Written and signed confirmation from both, you and Mr E ***, that he allowed you to deposit with his account on our casino.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please be informed that we are securing your data, and you don't have to worry about anything. The process can go quite fast when we receive the right documents from you. And the good news is: as soon as your account is verified future payout requests can be processed much quicker!</p>
<p>I don't understand that at all! My husband Jürgen E *** does not have a Skrill account. I cannot have made a deposit from there. Also, I haven't made a deposit using Skrill in the past few years.</p>
<p>A copy was sent to me as proof of this. Nothing can be seen on it. I will be happy to make this available to you.</p>
<p>I don't know what that is about and why you are coming up with such a demand now.</p>
<p>Please help me. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Roswitha</p>
