<p>Minute Media is the second significant media partner for WynnBET in the last few months after the operator signed a partnership with Blue Wire Podcasts in February.</p>
<p>WynnBET Adds Minute Media as Partner to Boost Awareness</p>
<p>WynnBET has teamed up with technology and digital publishing platform Minute Media, owner of numerous well-established sports and culture brands, including The Player’s Tribune, FanSided, and others.</p>
<p>The deal will allow WynnBET to benefit from Minute Media’s wide reach when it comes to media personalities and athlete influencers to create unique, story-driven content that will boost awareness for the WynnBET brand with an estimated 60 million people in the United States.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Wynn Resorts president Craig Billings said that WynnBET was excited and looking forward to creating compelling content and distribute it through the two companies’ combined properties.</p>
<p>“Minute Media creates and publishes high-quality sports-related content, much of it to avid local audiences, and we are excited about the opportunity to introduce WynnBET to them.”</p>
<p>Minute Media has a multi-channel distribution infrastructure that allows it to power over one billion video streams every month, the press release specified.</p>
<p>Building Unique Content for Targeted Audiences</p>
<p>Furthermore, Minute has targeted websites for every major professional sports team in the United States, allowing the companies to explore how to best reach audiences across the sports, entertainment, and lifestyle segments, using both video and audio content.</p>
<p>This content will focus on educating bettors on how to use WynnBET and recognize various trends in the sports betting space. Minute and Wynn plan on launching traditional ads, odds integration with the feeds provided directly from WynnBET, social media campaigns, and more.</p>
<p>Speaking on occasion, Minute Media founder and CEO Asaf Peled had this to add: “We’re thrilled to be working with WynnBET on this partnership, which will leverage our proprietary technology, robust video distribution, and athlete network to drive increased reach and awareness for their business.”</p>
<p>Building on Successful Partnerships</p>
<p>Minute is interested in exploring further opportunities in the sports betting segment and provide consumers with a unique content experience that they won’t find anywhere else, Peled added.</p>
<p>WynnBET has been successfully adding to its list of partnerships in the media space. The betting brand previously sealed a partnership with Blue Wire Podcasts in February, giving the operator access to the network’s 140 original shows.</p>
<p>The companies have agreed to create an on-premises podcast studio at Wynn Las Vegas and boost the operator’s involvement in producing quality content. The studio is expected to have a busy run as it will host various personalities from the world of sports and organize live events.</p>
<p>WynnBET most recently launched in Virginia, and the platform is live in five states as of the time of writing. WynnBET’s partnership with Minute Media precedes a bigger ambition for the company to enter the majority of licensed US markets.</p>
