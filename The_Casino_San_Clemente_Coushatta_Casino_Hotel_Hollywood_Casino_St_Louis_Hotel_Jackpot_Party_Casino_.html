<p>In anticipation of the MPN shutdown, Kindred-owned 32Red has sent an email notifying player that the company will suspend its poker operations, referring players to Unibet Poker.</p>
<p>32Red Shelves Poker Vertical After MPN Closure</p>
<p>Ahead of the forthcoming Microgaming Poker Network (MPN) closure due on May 19, British gaming giant 32Red has announced that it would quit the online poker vertical. The news isn’t surprising, but it still marks the end of an era for a company that was among the first to offer legal online poker product.</p>
<p>The company set up online poker shop back in 2002 and has been on the market for over 18 years now, specifically insofar as poker goes. All customers received an email on Wednesday, May 13, notifying them that 32Red.com will suspend further operations:</p>
<p>“We regret to announce that 32Red Poker will be closing down on 19th May, when the Microgaming Poker Network closes.”</p>
<p>The upside is that players will still be able to use their funds and account to access 32Red.com’s other verticals, making for a smooth transition for well-rounded consumers who keep busy across the full online gambling spectrum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, specific promotions, such as the Bad Beat Jackpot will no longer exist come May 18. Some have been quick to express disappointment, as the website enjoyed a good reputation and player base.</p>
<p>32Red Retains Good Standing in Other Markets</p>
<p>32Red continues to advertise and be a high-profile gaming giant in the United Kingdom’s market, enjoying several flagship partnerships with Middlesbrough, Glasgow Rangers, Preston North End and many others.</p>
<p>32Red has also dropped a quick hint that players are very welcome to head right over to Unibet’s network if they wish to enjoy a similar quality of poker product. This is not surprising, given that Kindred Group owns both brands.</p>
<p>Kindred owns 32Red since February 2017 when the company secured a £176 million deal. Meanwhile, Grosvenor Poker, another entity affiliated with the MPN, joined the iPoker Network and added to the ranks of established operators, including Betfair, bet365, and William Hill.</p>
<p>Poker is experiencing an uptick in activity as most sports are currently discontinued. According to global data, online poker traffic reached 200% in April, with the trend now coming into a definitive phase. 888poker registered a 60% spike in overall poker traffic over the period.</p>
<p>Would poker continue to drive interest or would the return of sports betting competitions, such as the K-League, Bundesliga, NASCAR, and UFC lead to a dip in interest?</p>
