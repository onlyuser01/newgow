    <h1>Vicksburg Casinos Castle Casino Login Delano Casino Horseshoe Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casinos In Flo</h1>

<p>So a quick update here, the management at Yabby casino is now not responding to me messages at all, I've sent a message to them every couple hours asking questions and demanding answers and haven't even gotten the typical cut and paste automated response.... To say the least this is disheartening because I actually liked Yabby casino and have been a long time customer. I'm not sure who is running the show over there but whoever made this decision to freeze both my accounts over a $50 withdrawal and use their bogus fake verification excuse as the reason why should be fired... You don't treat good long term customers that spend money at your establishment like shit or just as worse as if they don't even exist. The lack of respect in both communication and actions by both casinos is like I said before unprofessional, unproductive, and unbecoming of not only the Casinos as a whole but everybody who works at them from the lowest support agent and management and finally to the owner at the very top. If they had a phone number I would be blowing them up every 5 minutes and cussing them the ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ out for what I've had to go through and all for what??? $50?? I'm still in disbelief as to why things had to come to this point. I feel like maybe some new hotheaded manager made a bad decision and instead of admitting he's wrong and undoing it he's gone and double triple quadruple down on it and everyone there is like well fuck it he's the boss just do as he says. I say this because depending on who I talk to when I tell them my troubles they act confused and say things like earlier when the managers first email was the one stating you shouldn't have to verify yourself if you only deposit and withdraw with crypto... And then as if they just got the memo they become robots repeating the same thing about banking verification, ignore my questions, and then ignore he altogether... Sounds like it's someone at the top of management who has it out for me for whatever reason..</p>
