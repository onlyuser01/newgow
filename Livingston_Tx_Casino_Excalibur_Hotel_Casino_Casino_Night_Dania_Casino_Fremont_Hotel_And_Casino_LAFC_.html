    <h1>Livingston Tx Casino Excalibur Hotel Casino Casino Night Dania Casino Fremont Hotel And Casino LAFC</h1>

<p>Los Angeles FC’s players are hoping to end their three-game losing streak in the MLS this weekend when they take on the San Jose Earthquakes</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC lost each of its three previous MLS games, including “El Trafico” on Fourth of July. Alarm bells are ringing in the locker room of the reigning MLS champion, but LAFC is still flying high in the Western Conference, so there’s still no need to panic. But there will be if Steve Cherundolo’s men lose again.</p>
<p>On Saturday, July 8, they’re welcoming the San Jose Earthquakes at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles, which is where they’re 7-0-1 against this opponent in all competitions.</p>

<p>Moneyline Odds Los Angels FC -220 Draw +424 San Jose Earthquakes +540</p>

<p>Los Angeles FC Ready to End the Losing Streak</p>
<p>LAFC is third in the Western Conference of the 2023 MLS, with 32 points after 20 games. Steve Cherundolo’s men have a record of 9-5-6 with three of those seven losses happening in the previous three MLS rounds. They’ve got a score difference of 29-23, with seven goals conceded in the last three games.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it’s clear that their form is abysmal. What’s not clear is why that is the case. They do have a couple of injured players, but none of those are considered crucial. Further, only one of their first-team players is away at the Golden Cup (defender Aaron Long).</p>
<p>Another thing confusing everyone is that in each of those three games that they lost, they were seen as betting favorites. LAFC was a -110 favorite against LA Galaxy, a +125 favorite against FC Dallas, and a -189 favorite against the Vancouver Whitecaps.</p>
<p>San Jose Earthquakes Punching Above Their Weight</p>
<p>Last season, the San Jose Earthquakes finished bottom of the Western Conference table with an 8-11-15 record. They had the worst defense in the conference, conceding 69 goals in 34 games. That’s more than two goals per game on average.</p>
<p>This season, however, they’re doing much, much better. They’re 7-7-7 right now, with a score differential of 25-28. That’s kind of surprising considering that their roster hasn’t changed much in comparison to the previous season.</p>
<p>But we could see them plummet toward the bottom of the table in the next couple of weeks. Their schedule doesn’t look easy, and their form is pretty bad. They’re without a win in the MLS since early June, with two losses and two draws in their last four games.</p>
<p>LAFC vs. San Jose Prediction</p>
<p>The reigning MLS champions really need to pull themselves together. Losing three MLS games in a row is just way too much for a team of this caliber. They’ve got the motivation as well as the manpower needed to beat the Quakes on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pick: LAFC to win</p>
