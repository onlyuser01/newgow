    <h1>Coconut Creek Casino Westgate Resort Casino Las Vegas Boomtown Casino Monarch Casino Tioga Down Casi</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>namely a tournament played at Videoslots which cost 5 â‚¬ to participate, the tournament or battle as they say at Videoslots is called 150 Guaranteed Freezout with the battle ID 2823619.</p>
<p>I made first place in the tournament until the end of the time and like other players I had no more spins left which you can always see live in a leaderboard, then the website at Videoslots.com no longer went and had technical problems so that one Videoslots.com could no longer open. After two or three hours you could log in again and see that it was noted in the tunnel - canceled - I asked the live chat and the employee said I shouldn't worry, my winnings will not be lost. It will be checked and then booked in the next few days. In the middle of the week there was nothing on it, then again livecha "Our last piece of information is that all missing winnings, tickets, deposits and withdrawals have been processed since midday today. This means that all payments should be completed in the next 1-2 days .Please be patient. If you haven't received anything by the middle of the week, please contact us again. Your profit will not be lost, all battles can be tracked. " that calms me down and thought I'll wait until Friday, when nothing happened on Friday, I'm back in live chat and they said "Unfortunately, in the event of technical problems, we can't do more than replace the purchase prices and the battle turned out to be for all players unfortunately canceled due to technical problems. In this case there is unfortunately no winner in this battle. ". My problem is that the disturbance only came when the battle was over for at least 5 minutes. If the disruption had happened in the battle and you could not have played that would have been ok for me if they break it off but like to cancel a completed battle from the past with me. I've been a customer there for so many years and what do I know how many thousand euros I deposited there and then you have to run after the 82.52 euros you won ... that's really bad customer service. I also find it strange that you can no longer find the tunier under the Battle Id, just as it was deleted from my game history and other courses. You can only see from the tunier tickets that I played that and my screenshots. I hope you can help me. A heartfelt thank you</p>
