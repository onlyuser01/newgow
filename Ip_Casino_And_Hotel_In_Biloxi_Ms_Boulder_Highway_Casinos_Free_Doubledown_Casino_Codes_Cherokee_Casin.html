<p>Relax Gaming, an award-winning iGaming aggregator, has teamed up with Lottoland and will provide the operator with a range of award-winning and unique games. Presently, Relax’s aggregator platform has over 3,000 online casino games developed by both partner suppliers as well as its own in-house development teams.</p>
<p>Boosting Market Exposure and Player Base</p>
<p>Collected through the Silver Bullet and Powered By Relax initiatives, Relax is in a position to offer partners access to prime gaming experiences that come with high engagement and retention metrics. As a result of this tie-up with Lottoland, Relax will gain access to 15 million new customers, which is Lottoland’s estimated player base.</p>
<p>As to Lottoland, the brand will be able to provide its own players with some of the leading games amassed by the platform, including Temple Tumble, Snake Arena, and Money Train 2 to name a few. Relax offers a vast choice of more than 50 software partners that are happy to have their products introduced to new audiences.</p>
<p>Relax will also benefit from the reinforced presence and new entries in 15 markets that are covered by Lottoland’s licenses. Lottoland has been able to establish a footprint in global gaming markets through lottery-style games, but it has been expanding rapidly in other aspects of the experience, including sports, bingo, and casino.</p>
<p>Executives Happy with Developments</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard welcomed the opportunity to be expanding the company’s alliance and offer Relax products to the millions of players available at Lottoland:</p>
<p>“Lottoland is an operator with enormous status and reach. I’m sure the addition of our extensive portfolio will only benefit that reputation further as they continue to grow and differentiate themselves.” Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard</p>
<p>Attard has been promoted to CCO recently and she will be focusing on strengthening the B2B and B2C segments. Lottoland CEO Nigel Birrell welcomed the new content and said that it would strengthen the company’s platform while boosting the core lottery perfect.</p>
<p>Birrell said that Relax Gaming offers a strong variety of products that would ultimately benefit Lottoland and help it meet demand. Earlier this year, Relax Gaming extended its partnership with Silverback, an acclaimed maker of iGaming titles.</p>
<p>Lottoland has been working around the clock to improve its iGaming platform as well. Late last year, the company teamed up with Greentube for its distinguished portfolio of titles.</p>
