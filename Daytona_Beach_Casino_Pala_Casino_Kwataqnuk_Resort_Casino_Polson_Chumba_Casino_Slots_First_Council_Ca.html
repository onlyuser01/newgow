    <h1>Daytona Beach Casino Pala Casino Kwataqnuk Resort Casino Polson Chumba Casino Slots First Council Ca</h1>

<p>Online poker players in Ontario will soon be able to benefit from a new poker room, following the joint announcement of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) and GGPoker today that they would be launching WSOP.CA this spring.</p>
<p>Launch Subject to Agreement with iGaming Ontario</p>
<p>The launch of the fully-regulated online poker room WSOP.CA is still subject to “the successful execution of an operating agreement with iGaming Ontario,” a subsidiary of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) which conducts and manages internet gaming in the Canadian province when provided through private gaming companies.</p>
<p>Scheduled to open for online poker players in Ontario in early April, the WSOP.CA poker room will combine the best of the WSOP brand and its parent Caesars Entertainment and will operate on GGPoker software.</p>
<p>The poker room will entice players with access to exclusive WSOP tournaments and satellites, as well as an automatic enrollment in the Caesars Rewards loyalty program, in which they can exchange their loyalty points for amenities at Caesars properties across North America.</p>
<p>The new WSOP.CA online poker room will utilize the services of prominent poker pro Daniel Negreanu as a brand ambassador. The native Ontario player, winner of one WSOP ring and six WSOP bracelets, has been serving as a GGPoker brand ambassador since 2019.</p>
<p>“As a proud Ontario native, I’m thrilled that poker’s two greatest brands have come together to launch WSOP.CA and offer the Ontario poker community the perfect place to play online. You’ll be seeing exclusive WSOP rewards and tournaments, running on GGPoker’s amazing app – what’s not to love about that?” Daniel Negreanu, Ambassador, WSOP.CA</p>
<p>The Best of Brand and Software</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, WSOP executive director Ty Stewart outlined the partnership between WSOP and GGPoker as a combination of the best of both worlds – “the best poker brand with the top poker software,” thrilled to make this new opportunity available to online poker players in Ontario.</p>
<p>“We look forward to seeing Ontarians qualify for the live WSOP in Las Vegas this summer and challenge native son Daniel Negreanu for a gold bracelet.” Ty Stewart, Executive Director, WSOP</p>
<p>WSOP and GGPoker initially partnered in April 2020 for the launch of the WSOP Super Circuit Online Series set to run for three weeks starting in early May. Last December, GGPoker announced the second edition of the WSOP Super Circuit Online, the WSOP Winter Online Circuit from December 12 through January 9 to extend the partnership with the WSOP.</p>
