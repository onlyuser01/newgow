    <h1>Thunder Valley Casino Resort Lincoln Ca Diamond Sky Casino Yellow Brick Road Casino Chittenango Ti C</h1>

<p>through my verification you can see that I am only one person I have nothing to do with an account of v*** I place my bets only alone. If your algorithm finds any similarities with other accounts then I can not help it! Just because other customers bet the same or similar bets as me they can not block me what advantage should I even have from it? It is not worth it at all to play with different accounts! It is an impertinence what you insinuate me here! Therefore, I ask them to my deposit + my winnings to let me pay out!</p>

<p>Betreff: Re: Re: Account closed</p>
<p>I don't know what this is all about! I just see that there has been a big misunderstanding!</p>
<p>Or they are trying to steal my money!</p>
<p>I only have 1 account S<strong><em>9119 I don't know anyone who has an account with V</em></strong>! What evidence is that supposed to be? Please be honest if I am too much in plus for you ok then I will take my deposit + my winnings but to take my winnings here is criminal!</p>

<p>Dear account holder,</p>
<p>No one ever told you that you have registered more than one account! You know very well what is all about.</p>
<p>We respect fair play. We have collected all needed evidence for connection between both accounts "V<strong><em>" and "S</em></strong>9119".</p>
<p>You are free to fire any complains wherever you want. Instead of wasting your time you talk to any lawyer first, ask for explaining these:</p>
<p>Please read these Terms very carefully as they form a binding legal agreement between you - our customer (the "Customer") - and us (the "Ditobet").</p>
<p>By using, visiting and/or opening an account (the "Account") and using the Service you agree to be bound by:</p>
<p>these Terms;</p>
<p>our Privacy Policy (including Cookies Policy);</p>
<p>our Betting Rules (including all rules applicable to our betting or gaming products)</p>
<p>our AML and KYC Policy</p>
<p>If you do not accept the Terms, do not use the Website. Where you play any game, or place a bet or wager, using the Website, you accept and agree to be bound by, the Rules which apply to the applicable products available on the Website.</p>
<p>2.5. You are only allowed to register one Account with Ditobet. Accounts are subject to immediate closure if it is found that you have multiple Accounts registered with us. This includes the use of representatives, relatives, associates, affiliates, related parties, connected persons, and/ or third parties operating on your behalf. You can have only one account per person, family, household address, email address, payment account number, IP address, mobile device and/or shared computer, i.e. Public library or workplace. If we have good reason to believe that you have opened several accounts with the intent to defraud the Company, we reserve the right to immediately close all of them.</p>
<p>2.7. Should a dispute arise, you and Ditobet agree that the Ditobet transaction log database will be the ultimate authority in such matters.</p>
