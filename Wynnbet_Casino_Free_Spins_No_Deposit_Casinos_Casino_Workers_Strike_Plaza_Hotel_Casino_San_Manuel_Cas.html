<p>Gaming Laboratories International (GLI), a provider of high-quality testing services to the gambling industry, announced two important promotions. As reported by the company, the experienced Ginnie Hollis and Samantha Powell have been promoted to vice president positions, reinforcing the company’s global leadership team.</p>
<p>Ginnie Hollis, GLI said, is based in GLI’s office in Colorado, USA, and will assume the role of VP of engineering. In this role, she will focus on the support and development of her teams, regulators, suppliers and operators primarily in the digital space, globally.</p>
<p>Hollis, the company added, is an experienced individual and a long-time GLI worker who joined the company in 2005. Prior to her promotion as VP, she served as the company’s director of engineering and worked primarily with global/remote teams and new and existing clients.</p>
<p>Samantha Powell, on the other hand, is based in GLI’s office in Adelaide, Australia. She has also been appointed as VP of engineering and is tasked with the support and development of her teams, regulators, suppliers and operators primarily in the land-based gaming space, globally.</p>
<p>Just like Hollis, Powell is a long-time GLI worker who joined the company in 2001. Since then, she has participated in and overseen teams in engineering, math, compliance and quality assurance. Before her current promotion, Powell served as general manager of GLI APAC.</p>
<p>GLI’s Chief Delivery Officer Praised the Promotions</p>
<p>The two promotions were praised by GLI’s chief delivery officer, Mackenzie Haugh. Haugh lauded the two women as exemplary industry professionals, saying that their promotions as VPs will benefit both the company and its clients.</p>
<p>I’m so proud of both Ginnie and Samantha. The mindset, capability and effort put forth are truly exemplary, and by appointing them to these key roles in the digital and land-based divisions respectively, they, along with their peers, will further drive an experience for both our valued customers and our esteemed team members that is truly unmatched. Mackenzie Haugh, chief delivery officer, GLI</p>
<p>GLI pointed out that these promotions recognize Hollis and Powell’s skills, reflecting why so many engineers select it as an employer of choice.</p>
<p>In other news, the testing company recently secured accreditation for its testing labs in India and Canada, helping it solidify its position as a company that delivers the highest quality land-based, lottery, and iGaming testing and assessment services around the world.</p>
