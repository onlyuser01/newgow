<p>SPRIBE, a creator of innovative and out-of-the-box content for the online casino industry, has had exciting news to report from Ghana where a lucky player managed to turn a GH¢20 wager into a major success.</p>
<p>The person, who was playing at betPawa Ghana, secured a $500,000 payday, which is the biggest win to date in the history of the game in the entire continent, Casino Guru News was informed via an email press release.</p>
<p>The player, identified only by their first name, Fuseini, decided to hop on in for a quick session, placing the small wager and letting their plane soar through the skies. After a while, Fuseini, mesmerized by the increasing multiplier realized that they had hit $500,000 or GH¢6m in local currency.</p>
<p>Fuseini’s feat is doubly impressive when you consider that the game has been available in the market since 2018 and no other person has come even close. Commenting on this exciting opportunity, SPRIBE CCO Giorgi Tsutskiridze hailed the event, and the success of Aviator as a thrilling and worthwhile game well across the world.</p>
<p>Aviator, Tsutskiridze, explained is played by more than 10m players in the world, and it has been evolving and innovating the casino experience with big strides. Fuseini will also get another reward – he will be at the very top of the Aviator Battle Royale Leaderboard which will immortalize his remarkable win.</p>
<p>"It’s also great to see betPawa give Fuseini the royal treatment following his big win. This is a great branding opportunity for the operator and also helps to make even more players aware of the Aviator and why it’s the number one crash game on the planet," Tsutskiridze continued.</p>
<p>betPawa CCO Ntoudi Mouyelo was similarly excited to see his brand serve as the venue of such a remarkable achievement. Mouyelo congratulated Fuseini on his success and wished the player all the best. "Aviator really is one of the most popular games in our lobby, and we look forward to sharing more big win stories as they land," the CCO added.</p>
<p>Spribe has been expanding the reach of its game with several market and brand launches across Europe as well. The game has been available for a while in Portugal and earlier this year, SPRIBE also introduced Aviator to SKS365’s Planetwin365 in Italy.</p>
