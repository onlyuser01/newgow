    <h1>Westgate Resort And Casino Tulalip Casino Events River Spirit Casino Hotel Planet Hollywood Resort C</h1>

<p>Good day Nick,thanx for your fast reply</p>
<p>I did not mentioned gambling issues at my email but I did mentuoned with CAPITAL letters that I wish to close my account WITHOUT the option to be reopened in the future even if I ask for it and we make it clear with my VIP manager that they understood and the will do as I sayed.</p>
<p>So is crystal clear that my wish is not to be able to reopen my account there,which screams gambling issues.</p>
<p>I requested many timea in the past account closure there but this time as I say I made it crystal clear NOT TO BE REOPENED IN THE FUTURE EVEN IF I ASK FOR IT,and they replied back that they understood and will di as I wish.</p>
<p>Sorry for the capital letters,is for emphasising what I sended to them.</p>
<p>I had request self exclusion for gambling issues at their partner casino Rabona with the same email,username etc.</p>
<p>Casinos are responsible to recognise gambling issue behaviour by law,if I am not mistaken.</p>
<p>I will forword the emails to you.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention that first I requested permanent account closure via live chat,but they told me because i am a VIP (top level) I have to request so by email from my VIP manager.</p>
<p>And please clarify something,if I did not mention gambling issues and we make it clear and we both confirm "closure without the option of reopening" isn't my wish that should be fullfiled?</p>
<p>Then as I understand,they knew I am an axdict,they replied lie to me that they will permanently close my account and they did not,because they knew that I will be back depositing and looaing alof course tens of thousands.</p>
<p>So,lies are allowed???</p>
<p>Why they didi not asked me what is the reason I request permanent closure without option of reopening?</p>
<p>King Regardss</p>
