<p>Our 2023 Verizon 200 at the Brickyard preview is what you ought to read to learn about NASCAR odds and see our top prediction for Sunday’s race.</p>
<p>The Verizon 200 at the Brickyard is going to be the third edition of this event, with the previous two being won by AJ Allmendinger and Tyler Reddick. There are many other drivers, however, who have triumphed on this racetrack, in the now-defunct Brickyard 400. Among the active drivers with wins at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway are Kevin Harvick (twice), Kyle Busch (twice), and Brad Keselowski (once).</p>

<p>Martin Truex Jr. and Tyler Reddick Seen as Top Favorites</p>
<p>Martin Truex Jr. (+400) is the no. 1 favorite to win the race on Sunday, the main reason being that he’s the current leader of the 2023 NASCAR Drivers’ Championship. He’s sitting top of the table with 57 points more than the second-placed Denny Hamlin.</p>
<p>Truex Jr. started the season slowly, but then upped his form sometime in spring, winning his first race on May 1 at Dover (Wurth 400). Since then, he’s won two more races (at Sonora and New Hampshire Motor Speedway).</p>
<p>He finished on the podium in two of the last three races, so it’s not crazy to assume he’s gonna do well again. But will he win the 2023 Verizon 200 Brickyard? Odds suggest so, although Tyler Reddick’s odds aren’t miles away.</p>
<p>Reddick won this race last year, putting on a vintage performance at the Brickyard. This season, he’s not doing great, so winning this event on Sunday would really be a massive boost for him. He’s only won one race in 2023, and it happened back in March. To be fair, it’s not because he hasn’t been driving well; it’s because his Toyota has been glitchy this season.</p>
<p>Chase Elliott Desperate for a Win</p>
<p>It’s been a horrible season for Chase Elliott, but he still has a chance to turn it around. He missed seven races this season, while in the other 16, he finished in the top 3 on only three occasions and is still without a single win in 2023.</p>
<p>He will need to win (at least) one of the three remaining races in order to book the ticket to the NASCAR Playoffs. Will he do it, and if he does, will it happen at the Brickyard this Sunday? Well, one may say that Elliott isn’t too much of a fan of Indianapolis events. He’s never won a single race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in the NASCAR Cup Series career, with his best finish being the No. 4 place in the 2021 Verizon 200 race.</p>
<p>2023 Verizon 200 at the Brickyard Prediction</p>
<p>Martin Truex Jr. is the main favorite for a reason. He’s the best driver in the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series with the best car. We think he’s going to do great once again. In fact, we’re almost certain he’s going to finish in the top 3, while we also believe there’s a good chance that he might win the race. It’s good enough for us to make him our top pick for Sunday’s event.</p>
<p>Pick: Martin Truex Jr. to win</p>
