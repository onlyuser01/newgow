<p>Get Ready for an Unforgettable Journey</p>
<p>The dusky backdrop nicely compliments the overall mysterious atmosphere of the game. As you are getting ready to embark on the unforgettable journey of collecting the titular tome, you will start to notice a plethora of popular features belonging to previous Wazdan releases with similar adventure themes and captivating soundtracks.</p>
<p>As explained by the company’s chief commercial officer, Andrzej Hyla, Book of Faith is a game “for adventure-seekers” that sends players on a special quest where they will eventually discover the power of the ancient scripture.</p>
<p>Mixing the computer-style gaming approach with its engaging mechanics and eye-catching graphics, the studio has managed to generate the ultimate experience for the slot aficionado.</p>
<p>Hyla further explained the use of the player-favorite Collector symbols guarantees “next-level gameplay”, boosted engagement, and a higher chance to hit lucrative jackpots during Free Spins rounds.</p>
<p>Free Spins, Book Bonus, Collect to Infinity &amp; Chance Level</p>
<p>The Collector symbol accumulates value from both Jackpots and Bonus symbols. The Collector icon, which can pop up randomly, works by adding its value to one of the five existing Treasure Chests seen on the board.</p>
<p>The Treasure Chests are paid out at the end of the Free Spins round. The Book of Faith symbols represent the scatters. Whenever at least three of them are seen landing on the grid, players are rewarded with between 10 and 30 Free Spins.</p>
<p>Once a Free Spins round is activated, a single icon is chosen to be the Expanding Bonus Symbol. Once the respective symbol makes an appearance during the Free Spins, it will proceed to cover the entire row and boost players’ wins before turning into a Bonus Cash symbol.</p>
<p>The latter can be gathered by the Collector mechanic. During this round, players can upgrade the Collector by either multiplying the accumulated prizes for a maximum win of 5000x the bet or by boosting the countdown up to infinity via the Collect to Infinity feature.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, Wazdan announced inking an Italy-facing agreement with Netwin. The month before that, the studio launched Hot Slot: 777 Cash Out Extremely Light Slot, the energy-efficient version of the iconic Hot Slot: 777 Cash Out game.</p>
