    <h1>The M Casino No Deposit Casinos Excalibur Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Trop Casino Agua Caliente Casin</h1>

<p>Do not play Crazeplay (Gammix Ltd.)</p>
<p>I am playing for 5 years on a lot of different online casinos. Never i was not pay out for any reason and never i won as much as this time.</p>
<p>Crazeplay wich have a fantastic platform and a quick</p>
<p>serviceteam have declined my request for paying out</p>
<p>â‚¬ 1000,00 i won and requested to withdrawl, besides that i had something like â‚¬ 327,00 still on my account, which they also took in. Its all gone. They did put 20 euros back, my deposit.</p>
<p>I played with â‚¬ 20 euro's and got â‚¬ 30,00 bonus.</p>
<p>I had to wager the total x 40, and I wagered more than 50 x 40 (2000) before withdrawl. Besides that i Also i never came above the â‚¬ 4,00 per role what is said in the terms and conditions. So i did meet all the listed terms and conditions before withdrawling. You also may not win mote than â‚¬ 5000</p>
<p>They took the whole â‚¬1300 saying i played a game i was not supposed to play, that was forbidden , so they do not pay out. They ask me to read the terms and conditions. But it is not listed in the terms and conditions of the bonus offer. There are the conditions of 40 x wagering etc. They say its on a (hidden) other part of the site in article 1.28, but in the bonus offer there is no refering to those term &amp; conditions. I think that part is ment not to pay out people who win. Criminal i believe...</p>
<p>Besides that on other sites they just dont let you to get in such (forbidden) game. Also on this site there were 2 times i could not play a game (not allowed for your country its said then), so thats easy..</p>
<p>I think now they made a mistake letting me win to much, but isnt that a luck of a gambler once in the three years ??</p>
<p>Dont play Crazeplay !!, you may come there too lose but whdn you win (big) they do not pay out.</p>
<p>Crazeplay is part of Gammix Ltd (Fair Gaming;ðŸ˜‰ also owner of 7 Gods Casino, Sugar Casino, Locowin Casino and Cashimagi Casino</p>
<p>All seem perfect with this company till withdraw request.</p>
