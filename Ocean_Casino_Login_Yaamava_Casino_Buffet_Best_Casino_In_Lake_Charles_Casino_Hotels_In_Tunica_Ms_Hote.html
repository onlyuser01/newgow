<p>Cryptocurrency-based online betting platform Sportsbet.io has signed a deal with football legend Kanu Nwankwo who will be the brand’s newest addition to its growing list of African representatives. The four-year contract will see Kanu partake in various promotional efforts to tap the ever-growing popularity of cryptocurrency in Africa.</p>
<p>Kanu Joins Sportsbet’s Host of African Celebrities</p>
<p>Kanu’s memorable career includes an Olympic gold medal with the Super Eagles, Nigeria’s national football team. The star player also played with Ajax in the Champions League and with Arsenal in the Premier League. “Signing for Sportsbet.io was the perfect opportunity to join the crypto revolution,” Kanu said regarding the deal. The sports legend stated that the bitcoin donations to the Kanu Heart Foundation had already proven that cryptocurrency could be a force of good in the world and that his partnership with Sportsbet would help spread awareness of such initiatives.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io Head of Africa, Albert Climent, welcomed Kanu to the team. He described the footballer as a true legend and hinted at future promotions focusing on the new celebrity. Climent drew attention to the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency betting and said he would be honored to work alongside Kanu.</p>
<p>This newest deal marks Sportsbet’s continued effort to attract African celebrities and market its services on the continent. The company previously attracted rap and hip-hop legends such as King Kaka, Tekno Miles, and Cassper Nyovest. In March, the company also signed with Afropop star Tekno Joining. This May, the bitcoin-based betting site hosted its “Ahead of the Game” event in Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city. Kanu and over 400 people watched the match between Manchester United and Arsenal. The sportsbook operator included a giveaway of 1 BTC and made a 250mBTC donation to the Kanu Heart Foundation.</p>
<p>Sports Betting and Cryptocurrency Are on the Rise in Africa</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io’s focus on its African market is not unexpected, given the rising popularity of sports betting on the continent. A survey by the South African government showed that roughly half of the country’s adult residents regularly participate in sports betting. Most countries in the continent have comparatively lax regulation on gambling, which has seen many foreign companies rapidly expand their businesses.</p>
<p>Africa’s rapid globalization has also significantly contributed to the growth of sportsbook operators. An ever-increasing section of the population has access to reliable internet and smartphones. Crypto is also gaining in popularity across the continent. In 2021, cryptocurrency users grew by an astounding 2,500%, and the Central African Republic even adopted Bitcoin as an official currency. These factors combined make Africa a hot opportunity for gambling operators and give context to Sportsbet.io’s continued investments in securing a foothold in the continent.</p>
