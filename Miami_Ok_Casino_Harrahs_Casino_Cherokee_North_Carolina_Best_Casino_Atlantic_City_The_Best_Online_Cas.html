<p>Crash and Loot games are a new form of online gambling entertainment that enjoys strong popularity in different markets across the globe. The games offer multipliers, making them more engaging and thrilling, which helps attract a wide range of players. The players of Loot and Crash games are granted a choice to either multiply their prize or cash out each round as they play against a randomized clock.</p>
<p>Last year, Portugal’s gambling regulator, Serviço de Regulação Inspeção de Jogos (SRIJ), hinted at plans to regulate Crash and Loot games. This regulation became a fact after earlier this year, the government implemented changes to the country’s main law for gambling. The change was implemented back in March this year and now, the SRIJ released instructions that are applicable for Crash and Loot game providers.</p>
<p>Strict Regulation on Crash and Loot Games</p>
<p>Under the new regulations Crash and Loot games suppliers are required to send daily reports for such activities. The rules demand providers of the games to ensure a return to player rate that is a minimum of 80% or more. Moreover, Crash and Loot games must offer multipliers between 1x and 100x.</p>
<p>As a part of the changes, operators need to contact SRIJ and provide daily reports for the activities of Crash and Loot games revealing details regarding the total number of bets, pay-outs, bonuses, earnings and more. “The Instructions are intended to define a set of procedures that make it possible to standardize the information that operating entities must report, which is necessary to control the activity of operating online gambling and betting,” explained the Portuguese gambling regulator in a statement.</p>
<p>Unlike poker or other forms of online gambling activities, Crash games enable the users to cash out at any point during their game. The mechanics of the game put the players against a clock and with time passing, they can secure a bigger prize. If the players fail to collect their prize in time, the round crashes, resulting in a loss for the player’s wager. With that in mind, if the player is lucky enough, they can collect a prize that can be up to 100x their wager.</p>
