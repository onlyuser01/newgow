<p>Kindred Group, the leading global online gambling operator, announced it expanded its North American presence Monday. The company revealed a new six-year partnership with the Swinomish Tribe in Anacortes, Washington.</p>
<p>The terms of the new deal will see the launch of Unibet &amp; Swinomish Sportsbook at the Tribe's Swinomish Casino &amp; Lodge located in Anacortes. It's important to mention that the launch is subject to the relevant regulatory approvals. Initially, the duo's collaboration is inked for six years. However, Kindred and the Swinomish Tribe can extend the partnership by adding five more years.</p>
<p>Upon gaining the needed regulatory approvals, this collaboration would mark Unibet's seventh state launch. Without any doubt, the upcoming launch will once again prove the flexibility of Kindred's product and its growing popularity in the regulated gambling market in the country.</p>
<p>Manuel Stan, Kindred Group's SVP of North America, commented in a statement released on October 24, 2022. He acknowledged that the company is excited to continue its US expansion by joining forces with the Swinomish Tribe in Washington. In conclusion, Stan said: "The opening of a Sportsbook Lounge at the Swinomish Casino and Lodge will allow us to offer best in class sports betting experience."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Kindred celebrated the 25th anniversary of its flagship brand Unibet. At the time of the announcement, the company acknowledged that the brand has grown significantly over the years, surpassing multiple milestones, and introducing new functionalities for the players.</p>
<p>In light of the Safer Gambling Week, Kindred donated shirt sponsorships of Middlesbrough and Rangers FC recently. This once again reaffirmed the company's commitment to responsible gambling. Before that, in September, Kindred inked two major deals. With the first one, the company boosted its European market growth via a partnership with the payments technology company Nuvei Corporation. The terms of the deal saw Kindred tap into Nuvei's leading payment services for multiple European markets.</p>
<p>In addition, again in September, Kindred extended its collaboration with the professional American football team based in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Eagles. The terms of the extended deal expanded the duo's collaboration for three more years.</p>
<p>As a leading global gambling operator, Kindred currently serves more than 30 million customers within the US, Europe and Australia. The company has a solid portfolio of nine brands that offer safe and fair online gambling entertainment.</p>
<p>Currently, Kindred has more than 2,000 employees. Besides being a founding member of the International Betting Integrity Association, the company is also a member of the European Gaming and Betting Association.</p>
