    <h1>Casino Inn Royal Caribbean Casino Royale Login Casino Restaurant Nyc Live Blackjack Casino Casinos N</h1>

<p>This was the worst experience I have ever had.</p>
<p>747live is a company that will not pay you your winnings.</p>
<p>I used the site for a month: betting on sports and playing casino.</p>
<p>One day I was unable to withdraw funds. The support team demanded a passport photo and selfies with it.</p>
<p>I sent them documents to their email admin@747live.</p>
<p>I waited a week for a reply.</p>
<p>And this is what their reply was:</p>
<p>"Hello,</p>
<p>After carefully checking your account, I am sorry to inform you that your betting patterns fall in a category considered highly suspicious and in these conditions we have the right to hold the won funds.</p>
<p>We have noticed that you already withdrew a large amount which is largely higher than your deposits, so we will not release any further amount.</p>
<p>Please do not open new accounts at 747.</p>
<p>This is a permanent ban.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Admin Luigi,"</p>
<p>I did not make a "suspicious bet", I tried to find out the details, but they could not define "highly suspicious" bets.</p>
<p>They could only reply:</p>
<p>"Dear Lukas,</p>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot disclose further information on the reasons why we have decided to block your account.</p>
<p>We have the right to close your account temporarily or permanently without giving any reasons if believe that you have bet in a suspicious way, without any prior notice as stated on the General Terms and Conditions, 12.1.</p>
<p>General Terms and Conditions | 747 Live - 747 Live"</p>
<p>I have studied their rules and blocking my account was not in accordance with their rules.</p>
<p>The rules do not state that they can not pay out winnings that exceed the deposit.</p>
<p>The rules also do not state that they can block a player who has won.</p>
<p>I have tried to prove to them, but all in vain. They are not contacting me again.</p>
<p>Players, I want to warn you - 747 will not pay you money if your deposit exceeds your winnings.</p>
<p>They blocked my account with my balance of $200.</p>
<p>"Thank you" 747 for a terrible experience.</p>
