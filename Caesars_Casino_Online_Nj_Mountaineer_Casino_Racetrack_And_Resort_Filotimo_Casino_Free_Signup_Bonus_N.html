<p>The Spillemyndigheden has launched a consultation period and will accept comments by interested parties until May 5 this year</p>
<p>Denmark’s gambling regulator, the Spillemyndigheden, has prepared new requirements for inspection standards in regard to the recently-introduced ID checks. For reference, the Nordic country will soon introduce player IDs that can be used to prevent problem gambling and casino crime.</p>
<p>The Danish Ministry of Taxation issued the player ID order last month, effectively requiring land-based casino operators to register players before allowing them to wager. The measure, which will come into power in October this year, seeks to align casino gaming with the KYC and AML processes that are already in use by the online casino vertical.</p>
<p>Now, the Spillemyndigheden has introduced new requirements for the inspection standards that brick-and-mortar casinos will have to adopt. The authority has published the requirements, urging interested parties to send their feedback.</p>
<p>As announced by the Spillemyndigheden, interested parties can submit their opinions on the standards before they are officialized. Interested parties can submit their opinions, advice, proposals and qualms using the regulator’s official contact form, picking “certification” as a category.</p>
<p>The Spillemyndigheden will accept comments until May 5 this year.</p>
<p>After going through the comments, the Spillemyndigheden will create a definitive version of the inspection standards, which will come into force on October 1, 2023. The regulator added that it expects the required changes to be implemented by licensees right away and no later than this date.</p>
<p>After implementing the new ID standards, license holders will be given a transition period of three months to have all requirements tested and inspected. The Spillemyndigheden expects operators to provide it with a certification report documenting the changes no later than December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The Spillemyndigheden concluded that the certification program and the standard reports will be available on its site from October 1.</p>

<p>Denmark Is Embattled with Gambling Harm</p>
<p>Denmark has a serious problem with gambling harm and hopes that the introduction of ID checks will help prevent problem players from losing money to retail gambling.</p>
<p>According to recent studies, the country has a whopping 500,000 people suffering from gambling problems. Because of that, Denmark decided to allocate funds for combating harm. According to a recent announcement, the Nordic country has set aside DKK 10 million for the research of harm and the promotion of safer gambling tools.</p>
