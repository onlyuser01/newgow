<p>Asoyan is a Digitain employee who previously served as the company’s chief technology officer. He has worked with the provider for a decade and is familiar with its team and business. During his time with the company, Asoyan has occupied various tech-related positions.</p>

<p>The newly-promoted CEO of technology commented on his new role. He said that he is delighted by the opportunity to serve Digitain in a new capacity and help the company grow. He said that Digitain, which has been his home for the last ten years, is a brand that he felt delighted to be a part of.</p>
<p>Asoyan noted that he has personally experienced the company’s growth in all areas of operations and across multiple markets. He trusts Digitain to continue evolving and said that he can’t wait to open a new chapter in his journey with the brand.</p>
<p>I will look forward to this next part of my journey with the brand. We have been and will continue to focus on new experiences, innovations, and the latest digital technologies for all our partners and customers to ensure we continue empowering your success within the iGaming supply chain.

<p>Digitain’s founder, Vardges Vardanyan, welcomed Asoyan on board, praising the new CEO of tech’s leadership qualities. He said that Asoyan’s experience with technology will help the company cement its position as a leading provider in the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>As we expand our global reach in new and existing markets, his contribution to technology and solutions will further consolidate our market position as a leading iGaming provider. Vardges Vardanyan, founder, Digitain</p>
<p>Other Recent Digitain Appointments</p>
<p>Asoyan is not the only change to Digitain’s team in 2023. In February, Digitain promoted the experienced Simon Westbury as the chief executive officer of Sport Generate, a sports tournament subsidiary.</p>
<p>The appointment will see Westbury work to improve Sport Generate’s global recognition and, by extension, expand Digitain’s presence. Back then, Digitain noted that this appointment is in line with its ongoing expansion plans.</p>
<p>A few days later, the company named Iain Hutchison as its chief revenue officer. As someone with significant experience in finance and gaming, Hutchinson is expected to spearhead the company’s revenue growth strategy.</p>
