<p>Gambit Rewards and Scuti, a g-commerce platform, have aligned their offers and brought them closer together. The partnership enables players to purchase items from the Scuti online store and then use rewards for free bets on Gambit’s dedicated gambling portals.</p>
<p>Gambit Integrates with Scuti to Continue Innovation</p>
<p>Presently, Gambit features both iGaming and sports experiences and enables players to participate in either. Commenting on this opportunity, Gambit CEO and founder Richard Pistilli said that the alliance with Scuti was a natural continuation of the company’s efforts to bring the best possible experience to its players.</p>
<p>He said that the tie-up enables Gambit to leverage its free-to-play offer and pair it with real cash prizes. Pistilli said that Scuti’s audiences loved in-game rewards and Gambit helped expand on this opportunity by providing “risk-free betting.” Scuti users can now exchange their in-platform currency for Gambit tokens, which can then be leveraged to place wagers, resulting in cash prizes or other rewards.</p>
<p>Scuti CEO and founder Nicholas Longano was equally pleased with the opportunity and argued that this was a pivotal moment for g-commerce. Bringing rewards in betting and gaming is an important step forward for the entire industry. He added:</p>
<p>Play-to-earn games are moving mainstream and this partnership makes it easier for players to enjoy gaming with rewards fueled by the very products they purchase every day. Today, holders can play-to-earn and use those rewards to place bets that come at no personal cost. Scuti CEO and founder Nicholas Longano</p>
<p>Gambit has been working actively to expand its loyalty programs with various gaming platforms. One of the company’s most recent tie-ups is with Gamelancer, dubbed as the world’s largest Gen Z Social Gaming Network. As a result, Gambit’s iGaming and free-to-play sports betting platform were introduced to Gamelancer’s 28 million users worldwide.</p>
<p>Bally’s Interactive Among Parties to Trust Gambit</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Bally’s Interactive acquired a $5 million stake in Snipp, the parent company of Gambit Rewards, and integrated the loyalty options into its own offer. Free-to-play options have become increasingly popular in leveraging the popularity of sports betting and iGaming platforms around the United States.</p>
<p>Every sportsbook in the country has considered some form of fantasy or F2P solution to introduce more sports fans to sports betting while removing the risk factor in the hopes of converting casual fans into active sports bettors.</p>
