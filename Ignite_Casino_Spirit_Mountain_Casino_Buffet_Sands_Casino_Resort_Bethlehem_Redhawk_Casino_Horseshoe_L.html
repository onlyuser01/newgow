    <h1>Ignite Casino Spirit Mountain Casino Buffet Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem Redhawk Casino Horseshoe L</h1>

<p>I made a deposit of 100 eur in this casino, having received a bonus of 250% ( 250 euros).</p>
<p>email - e<strong>*</strong>*6@hotmail.com</p>
<p>I played for a few hours, having managed to reach a balance of 1860 eur. The game I was playing crashed, I had to go back to the lobby, and when I tried to refresh the page to continue playing, I accidentally canceled the bonus. My entire balance disappeared and my account was left at zero. The bonus amount was 250 eur, not 1860!!! After talking via chat, they refuse to solve the problem, and are even rude and impolite. You can withdraw the bonus as I accidentally and unintentionally canceled it, but where is my remaining balance??</p>
<p>this situation is outrageous and goes against the casino's own terms and conditions!</p>
