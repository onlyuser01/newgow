<p>Britain’s Labour Party Would Introduce Sweeping Changes to Online UK Gaming Regulations if Elected</p>

<p>Britain’s Labour Party is promising to upend the country’s online gaming industry by implementing strict new limits on speed and stakes of play — if it can manage to win power.</p>

<p>While declaring that the UK’s 2005 Gambling Act is “unfit for the digital age,” deputy party leader Tom Watson wondered aloud why the two markets are held to a completely different standard.</p>
<p>“Whereas gambling in the offline world is highly regulated, the lack of controls on online gambling is leading to vulnerable consumers suffering huge losses,” he said via the BBC.</p>
<p>Watson has previously said that he’d look at banning the use of credit cards for online gaming as well.</p>
<p>Under the Labour Party’s proposed regulations, a “culture of limits” would be introduced which would restrict the amount of money a that someone can bet through an online operator, as well as how fast they can bet it.</p>
<p>However, they would first need to win power in order to change online regulations. The UK’s next general election is not set to be held until 2022.</p>
<p>Advertising Crackdown</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that Britons will have to wait that long to see major changes in the gaming market.</p>
<p>On April 1, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) and the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP) will introduce new restrictions on gambling ads in the UK.</p>
<p>Adverts will no longer be shown on any platform where people under 18 make up at least 25 percent of the audience.</p>
<p>The content of the ads themselves will also be severely restricted. Athletes and celebrities who are under 25-years old will no longer be allowed to appear in gaming ads, even if they only look younger than 25. The appearance of cartoon characters will also be banned.</p>
<p>New betting limits on the highly controversial fixed-odds betting terminals — essentially the UK equivalent of slot machines — are set to come into effect in October of this year, as well.</p>
<p>Although that wasn’t soon enough for the former Minister of Sport, who resigned in outrage over the decision to delay the restrictions.</p>
<p>Betting Behemoths</p>
<p>Figures form the UK Gambling Commission show that Great Britain has the biggest regulated online gaming market in the world, raking in some $6.21 billion every year.</p>
<p>However, in terms of the global market — regulated or otherwise — the most recent figures show that the UK and the rest of Europe are still way behind Asia.</p>
<p>2018 Global Gaming Revenues Asia Pacific: $71.4B (China — $37.9B)</p>
<p>Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa: $28.7B</p>
<p>North America: $32.7B (USA — $30.4B)</p>
<p>Latin America: $5.0B</p>
<p>The online gaming market is still relatively small by comparison but is expected to erupt in the years ahead. One recent report suggested that it will grow at 11.8% per year and reach a total value of $128.8B by 2026.</p>
