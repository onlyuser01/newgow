<p>America's leading lottery app, Jackpocket, announced it forged a new partnership with the famous professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts, Boston Red Sox. Announced earlier this week, the collaboration sees the company become the team's Digital Lottery Courier Partner. The new multi-year deal is expected to deliver thrilling activations and giveaways.</p>
<p>Jackpocket revealed that it plans to engage in multiple giveaways, awarding major prizes to the team's fans. Judging by a statement released by Jackpocket, such prizes can include unique VIP experiences like behind-the-scenes ballpark tours, tickets to home games, as well as other activations. Similar to other collaborations, the app confirmed the launch of a new special promo code, celebrating its collaboration with the Boston Red Sox. As a result, first-time customers in the state can use the code "SOX" while checking out to secure their first $2 lottery ticket for free.</p>
<p>Thanks to the multi-year collaboration, Jackpocket becomes the first Digital Lottery Courier Partner of the famous Boston-based team. Under the terms of the deal, the app will benefit from in-game exposure via the team's scoreboard LED branding, the Truly Terrace LED ribbon along with a pre-game commercial before Boston Red Sox home games played at Fenway Park.</p>
<p>Moreover, Jackpocket will benefit from a social media channels presence with the baseball team. This is expected to further elevate the experiences for fans as they will have the option to secure a free lottery ticket and benefit from other awards.</p>
<p>Troup Parkinson, the Executive Vice President, Partnerships for Boston Red Sox, shared his excitement about the new collaboration saying: "The Boston Red Sox are proud to partner with Jackpocket, the club's first Digital Lottery Courier." Finally, he pointed out: "With their digital lottery courier app now available in Massachusetts, we are excited to work with Jackpocket to offer fans convenient access to gaming and help boost local lottery business."</p>
<p>The latest collaboration complements the growth of Jackpocket across the US. In fact, the deal with the Boston Red Sox represents the company's fifth partnership with an MLB franchise. It also helps grow Jackpocket's portfolio of partners, after important deals were announced with famous leagues such as the NHL, NFL, NBA, NCAA and MLB.</p>
<p>Peter Sullivan, Jackpocket's CEO, explained that the Boston Red Sox are synonymous with baseball. "We are thrilled to be the digital lottery courier partner to this historic organization and to provide Massachusetts fans a new, fun, and convenient way to play the lottery â€“ right from their phones," he added.
