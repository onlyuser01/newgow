    <h1>Cache Creek Casino Brooks Ca Excalibur Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Yamava Resort And Casino Philadelph</h1>

<p>SuperBook®, the sports betting brand operating in Nevada through the Westgate Las Vegas Resort &amp; Casino and via mobile betting, has become the 17th sportsbook to launch a mobile app in Colorado.</p>
<p>SuperBook® App Now Live</p>
<p>The launch of the app came as part of the deal SuperBook® signed with Jacobs Entertainment,a casino operator in Nevada, Louisiana and Colorado, under which the land-based gaming operator committed to introduce the sports betting operator at The Lodge Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado, via mobile sports betting and on-site retail sportsbook.</p>
<p>With significant presence on the market for more than 2 decades, SuperBook® was expected to bring its winning formula, consisting of best-in-class technology, unmatched entertainment, award-winning customer service and the industry’s most expansive wagering options.</p>
<p>After months of speculation and teasing its fans the mobile sportsbook would go live soon, the launch of the SuperBook® app in Colorado made the state the first venture of the sports betting brand outside of Nevada. Following its mobile launch, the brand will open the retail venue at The Lodge Casino, a mini version of its Las Vegas physical sportsbook.</p>
<p>Colorado Selected for Its Potential and Loyal Sports Fans</p>
<p>Jay Kornegay, executive vice president of operations at the Westgate SuperBook®, talked about the launch in an interview with PlayColorado.</p>
<p>When asked about the sentimental part of launching in his home state, Kornegay said he was thrilled to be in Colorado, as the Centennial State has a special place in his heart. He further elaborated his company was lured by the attractive 10% tax rate as part of the regulation-friendly sports betting environment, which allows for remote signups.</p>
<p>“So we thought it was a state that had tremendous upside with the fans there. They are great sports fans, as I’ve been preaching to them for over two years now. They’re very loyal fans.” Jay Kornegay, Executive Vice President, Operations, Westgate SuperBook®</p>
<p>The state regulation, the loyal fans and the great partnership SuperBook® formed with the Logde were the necessary ingredients for the brand which forced its hand to choose Colorado as its first venture outside of Nevada.</p>
<p>Asked about competition and what would be the feature that would distinguish SuperBook® from the others, Kornegay noted that they have kept a close eye on every operator in the state for a while.</p>
<p>“What separates us from some of the others is we have a very expansive menu. We’re price friendly. We have better odds, in most cases. Hooking up with the Lodge is certainly a plus as well, as many people in Colorado are familiar with the great partners we have.” Jay Kornegay, Executive Vice President, Operations, Westgate SuperBook®</p>
<p>He went on to encourage sports bettors in Colorado, much like most of sports players in Nevada, to open accounts with different operators to be able to make direct comparisons.</p>
<p>“Once they do open up a number of accounts, they’re going to see the difference between our product and some of the others because we have a tremendous menu. We focus on Colorado sports.” Jay Kornegay, Executive Vice President, Operations, Westgate SuperBook®</p>
<p>Jay Kornegay also shared his thoughts on the future of sports betting in the state, noting SuperBook® expects Colorado to establish a presence among the top 5 sports betting markets and stay there for a long time.</p>
