<p>Hippo Pop review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot has a safari animal theme.</p>
<p>Players enter a fantasy jungle filled with lush foliage and supernatural animals. Flamingos, zebras, tigers, fish, and frogs all peer out from the reels with glowing eyes. The eerie creatures seem imbued with special powers that they might share.</p>
<p>Players will enjoy communing with nature as they explore the exotic setting.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a holiday-ready tune featuring steel drums. This chill music adds an exotic atmosphere, but definitely seems more cheerful than some of the other aesthetics. The majestically magical animals might have better suited an ominous fantasy track. However, many players will probably enjoy the upbeat vibe of the soundtrack, and if not, mute is readily at hand.</p>
<p>The quality of the animation is decent with its vivid colour palette and consistent style. The jungle setting behind the reels is immersive as green light pours in from above. This suggests that the sunlight is being filtered through a dense roof of leaves. On either side of the reels, dainty flowers are blooming, adding a festive touch.</p>
<p>The highlight of the game are the enchanted animals. The stylised portrayal of each creature, as well as their glowing eyes, suggest that these are no ordinary jungle creatures.</p>
<p>The flamingo in particular has a slightly possessed look, and the design of its face makes it look a little like a dinosaur. One might expect it to speak cryptically in a rasping voice.</p>
<p>The showstopper is the hippo, who seems almost like a deity cast in gold. The hippo stares out directly at the players with an expression that is both sombre and intimidating.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music create a fun fantasy jungle world, though it’s a little unclear whether the magic is whimsical or ominous.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Hippo Pop has a five reel, three row base structure. However, after a winning combination, the winning symbols are replaced by 2 symbols increasing the size of the reels up to six symbols high during regular gameplay and eight symbols high during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>This game awards payouts whenever players land at least 3 matching symbols in adjacent rows, starting from left to right.</p>
<p>Players have the option to buy directly into the Free Spins feature if they wish (see feature details below).</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Should players fully expand the reels during the base game, a multiplier count up begins and will continue until there are no more wins. After the base game wins are paid out, the Free Spins feature is triggered.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature begins with the reels standing 3 symbols high, but will allow them to increase to 8 symbols high given enough wins.</p>
<p>The Free Spins also begin with a multiplier that is carried over from the base game.</p>
<p>The Free Spins Hippo Payout feature means that Hippo symbols will pay out more when the reels are higher. When the reels reach 6 symbols high, the Hippo symbol will pay out x2 its base value. The Hippo symbol will then payout x3 its base value if the reels reach 7 symbols high, and x4 its value should the reels reach the maximum of 8 symbols high.</p>
<p>Players will receive 2 additional free spins should they unlock the maximum height of the reels.</p>
<p>Players are offered 5 free spins of the Bonus Wheel as they begin the Free Spins feature. This provides the chance at extra prizes.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.1%, just about our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€40.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, high volatility animal-themed slot.</p>
<p>With unobjectionable RTP and ample volatility, this game is a good fit for strategy-conscious players.</p>
<p>The animation is certainly engaging, though the atmosphere is somewhat inconsistent.</p>
<p>Many players will enjoy the varied bonuses and have no trouble staying focused on the gameplay.</p>
