    <h1>7 Seas Casino Bingo Concerts At Foxwoods Casino Prairie S Edge Casino Hotel Doubledown Casino Promot</h1>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>I am not really sure, how to start. Till this point, its not a problem with casino. I understand there are some rules. I would just like to know, if there is a chance to fix this somehowe.</p>
<p>So, i dont play, this is the first time that i have singed. So i really didnt know about all rules.</p>
<p>i am at home, dont have my income, becouse we have 5 years old with special needs (have to take care of him, drive him to therapys...). My husbend works, and we use his account together (we have on bank signed, that i can use his account.</p>
<p>Yestrday i have by accident read (somewere else), that that ist the problem. Account on casino is on my name, but depos was from "his" bank account (on his name).</p>
<p>Now when i would like to withdraw, can have a problem.</p>
<p>I have contacted casino, i am waiting for infos. First answer was, that i can only with my bank account depost/withdraw. Now he will check with administrator, and have to contac them again later.</p>
<p>We dont have multiple accounts (my, husbands...) on casino site. Before i read about that, i did try to withdraw half of it on his account and half on my (so i can have it for playing) - but thats just becouse i didnt know about all of this.</p>
<p>Is there anything i can do, to prof that i am not scammer?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
