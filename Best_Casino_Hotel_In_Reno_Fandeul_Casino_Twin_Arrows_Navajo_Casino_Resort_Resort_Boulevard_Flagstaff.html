<p>William Hill Sportsbook runs a combination of retail and mobile sportsbooks all across the United States. The bookmaker is one of the most prominent brands not just in the US, but also the world at large when it comes to online sports betting and today we have the good fortune to be reviewing William Hill US, as one of the clear market leaders.</p>
<p>Apart from its sizeable footprint in America, William Hill brings a variety of promotions, competitive odds, the occasional promo code, and a dedicated state-of-the-art mobile app to make your online betting experience so much more fun.</p>
<p>The company runs a retail or/and mobile sportsbook in at least 16 states, including New Jersey, Nevada, Michigan, Virginia, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee Iowa, and West Virginia. There have been many launches throughout 2020 and 2021, making William Hill a distinct leader in the sports betting market. The company already has over 100 retail sportsbooks across the country, shaping it as one of the biggest sports betting giants anywhere in America.</p>
<p>William Hill Promo Code for 2021</p>
<p>William Hill has opted out of promo codes, thinking of them as an unnecessary burden to sports fans. Instead, you get to claim a bonus you think you would enjoy right from the start and by joining the sports betting action straight up.</p>
<p>There may be the occasional William Hill promo code here or there, but for the most part, the sportsbook prefers to keep things simple. If a bonus code is available, it will be featured in a promotion’s terms and conditions, and you will have no trouble claiming it.</p>
<p>William Hill Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>If you are in for some excellent promotions, you have come to the right place. William Hill has over 86 years of experience running retail businesses and close to 20 years in the online and mobile verticals.</p>
<p>As a result, you can expect a strong bonus offer insofar as the welcome online bonuses go, along with many other promos to keep your bankroll topped up and focused.</p>
<p>Welcome Bonus and Sign-up Bonus</p>
<p>To get yourself started, William Hill offers a $500 risk-free bet in most of the states it runs in, although the risk-free welcome offer may be subject to some changes depending on location. Without going into too much detail, each state will have a slightly altered experience best tailored to the local crowd.</p>
<p>In the case of the $500 risk-free bet, William Hill brings you a way to place a wager and recover it in case your selection falls short of its mark. A qualifying wager worth at least $10 is placed and then matched at 100% up to $500.</p>
<p>If your first deposit wager fails to hit the mark, you will be reimbursed the full amount and have another chance to place it. In places like New Jersey this promotion is standard, but keep in mind that Illinois has a $300 risk-free wager instead.</p>
<p>Event Specific Bonuses with William Hill US</p>
<p>William Hill brings a tailored sports betting experience to the United States by focusing on a strong start for any sports bettor on the website, but also enhancing the experience along the way.</p>
<p>Players will have the opportunity to benefit from various bets and promo opportunities tailored to big events, such as the Super Bowl, March Madness, Australian Open, PGA Tour, and more.</p>
<p>The promos can be allocated in the form of free bets, and once again reach as high as $500 so that you can make multiple selections on your favorite games or players during an event. All in all, it’s always best to hop over to the T&amp;C’s of each individual bonus to find the available detail.</p>
<p>Where Is William Hill Available?</p>
<p>William Hill Sportsbook has an impressive footprint in the United States. While many brands have been hesitant to invest in the retail sector without the trade-off of accessing the online market, William Hill has not sat idly to watch progress pass it by.</p>
<p>As a result, you can access the sportsbook in eight states as an online offer and 16 all over the country. Please keep in mind that each state is slightly specific and the bookmaker’s offer may have been adjusted to reflect any changes.</p>
<p>William Hill NJ</p>
<p>William Hill has been available in New Jersey since 2018. The sportsbook offers both mobile as well as a retail experience, courtesy of the company’s partnerships with Monmouth Park as well as numerous other locations in the Garden State.</p>
<p>William Hill CO</p>
<p>William Hill teamed up with Isle Casino, gaining an official market entry into Colorado in September 2020. Since then, the bookmaker has scaled operations online and added another land-based partner with Lady Luck Casino in Black Hawk.</p>
<p>William Hill IL</p>
<p>Illinois is another state where William Hill was quick to act in September 2020, launching its offer and bringing top-notch sports betting products. The state enjoys tailored promotions as well as dedicated apps. William Hill is partnering with Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin for its retail market presence.</p>
<p>William Hill WV</p>
<p>West Virginia was a part of multiple-state entries that William Hill embarked on in September 2020. The company rolled out its online sportsbook then, but it had already operated a retail sportsbook in partnership with Mountaineer Casino, New Cumberland already.</p>
<p>William Hill IN</p>
<p>William Hill broke ground in Indiana back in 2019 and it has been present in the state with a retail sportsbook. Sports fans can enjoy the intuitive sports betting software that powers the company’s product all across the USA. The online launch came later, in October 2020.</p>
<p>William Hill IA</p>
<p>William Hill Iowa is available as a retail sportsbook through a partnership with Prairie Meadows Casino, Racetrack, &amp; Hotel. The online betting site and app rolled out early in 2021, making it one of the first fresh launches for the company this year.</p>
<p>William Hill MI</p>
<p>Michigan moved quickly to legalize its mobile sports betting industry ahead of Super Bowl LV and issued 15 interactive betting licenses. The company teamed up with the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians to make sure it has market entry and the official online sportsbook arrived on January 22, 2021.</p>
<p>William Hill VA</p>
<p>Virginia didn’t want to miss out on Super Bowl LV and it formally allowed sportsbooks to launch online just days before the Big Game. William Hill arrived in the state on February 3, 2021, and cashed in on the NFL Season Finale.</p>
<p>How to Set Up My William Hill Sports Betting Account?</p>
<p>Set up is easy and William Hill will make sure that you are good to go in no time. The sportsbook will walk you through the process itself, asking you to fill out your personal information in detail so it may comply in full with state-mandated KYC and AML measures.</p>
<p>Your account will be up and running as soon as you have submitted your Full Name, Address, Date of Birth, and the last digits of your Social Security Number (SSN) to verify your identity as well as comply with responsible gambling practices upheld by William Hill.</p>
<p>Each state regulator scrutinizes activities at William Hill’s mobile and retail sportsbooks, meaning that the operator is trusted and reliable as confirmed by public consensus and regulatory approval. Once you are all done with the set-up, you can proceed to claim your $500 risk-free bet, or just deposit $10 to get your bankroll started.</p>
<p>William Hill App and Mobile Experience</p>
<p>Mobile is the preferred way American sports fans prefer to bet through, and this is understandable. With nearly 83% of all bets in the United States accepted online, at least where both mobile and retail options are available, the trend is quite clear.</p>
<p>William Hill has the necessary expertise and IT infrastructure to bring you state-of-the-art mobile betting solutions. This is possible through the dedicated Android and iOS apps available for download.</p>
<p>The app will grant you exclusive functionality over the website, making it easy to place a bet, check up on a result, track in-play selections, place multi-leg wagers, and more. You may download the solution from Google Play and Apple Store, depending on what device you use.</p>
<p>In terms of responsiveness and ease of use, the mobile app software is second-to-none and William Hill has packed the full desktop functionality into the bite-sized betting app for additional comfort.</p>
<p>William Hill Odds and Sports Covered</p>
<p>Variety is the spice of life and William Hill Sportsbook brings many markets, well-priced odds, and value betting opportunities to immerse you into a worthwhile betting experience through-and-through.</p>
<p>You will be able to bet on all mainstream events and have 100’s of possible bets to place on each individual game or match, thanks to William Hill’s superior pricing and automated model. Sports fans are welcome to bet on:</p>
<p>Football</p>
<p>Basketball</p>
<p>Hockey</p>
<p>Soccer</p>
<p>Tennis</p>
<p>Golf</p>
<p>Auto</p>
<p>Yet, there are numerous other sports and markets you will be interested in, including baseball, tennis, UFC and MMA, table tennis, darts, and so on. You will have every major league in the US featured as an available market, including NFL, NBA, NHL, NASCAR, PGA Tour, MLS, and college competitions, such as NCAAB and NCAAF.</p>
<p>The sportsbook will further cover hundreds of events and not least all big competitions whether this is March Madness, the Stanley Cup or Super Bowl, Premier League, UEFA Champions League, NASCAR, or the year’s biggest boxing ticket or UFC fight.</p>
<p>William Hill is equally well-versed in domestic as well as international events, with a great betting margin and competitive odds to make for a good reliable wagering experience. The pricing per selection is good, and you will have no particular trouble settling for standard Moneyline bets or options for the riskier Props and Parlays, tempted by the decent potential return rate they offer.</p>
<p>William Hill Popular Bets</p>
<p>In terms of actual bets you can place, the selection shines. William Hill’s odds are competitive, giving you more leeway when choosing what selection to make. The bookmaker focuses on traditional bet types, including Moneyline, Point Spreads, and Totals (Over/Under), as the main selection.</p>
<p>Yet, William Hill is in the habit of running dozens of Proposition bets per game, making for some interesting picks you can make yourself. Sports fans who are eager to get a little more challenging selections will feel at home choosing from Parlays, Teasers, and Round Robins as possible betting outlays too. There are literally hundreds of additional exotic or technical wager types that can make it worth your while if you make value bets and deliver on a successful outcome.</p>
<p>In terms of bet archetypes, William Hill is definitely up there, and this is not difficult to imagine. The company is a pioneer both in the retail as online sports betting space and if anything, other US players are now only beginning to catch up whereas William Hill has written the playbook.</p>
<p>You will find a number of cool bets, such as First Half, Second Half, and Quarter betting to try and predict specific outcomes in a limited time window within the game. This is where tine in-play betting markets come in handy.</p>
<p>In-Play Betting and William Hill</p>
<p>William Hill’s in-play betting markets are sharp, well-picked, and providing players with the necessary comfort and flexibility to enjoy a competitive setting with the added benefit of an intuitive user interface.</p>
<p>The live selection features much fewer games than the pre-game contests, and this is quite alright. The score is constantly updated at the top of the live betting market and statistic is posted, allowing you to quickly catch yourself on the available information.</p>
<p>Live betting is still only stretching its legs in the United States, but William Hill is not leaving much to chance by making sure to get an early start by fixing its markets and polishing its offer.</p>
<p>You can benefit from an intuitive Cash Out option that will allow you to withdraw a part of your bets or cancel a selection entirely if you choose to in exchange for a small fee. The Cash-Out tool is a potent ally that can help you pinpoint some excellent wagering opportunities and it will work without a fault every time.</p>
<p>What Payment Options Can You Use?</p>
<p>When it comes to banking methods, William Hill sticks with all core payment options that feel native to Americans and are easy to use, making your sports betting experience even more reliable.</p>
<p>Comfort when banking is paramount for a good time, and this is why William Hill only lists payment methods you can trust. We have summed the payment options for you in the table below to give you a good idea of the available deposits:</p>
<p>Payment Option Processing Time Min. Deposit Max. Deposit PayPal Immediate $20 Not specified Visa Immediate $20 $1,000 MasterCard Immediate $20 1,000 Cash at Casino Immediate $20 Not specified William Hill Prepaid Card Immediate $20 Not specified Check by Mail Time of delivery $20 Not specified</p>
<p>Overall, deposits at William Hill are easy enough and the sportsbook uses several possible payment options to make the process simple. For withdrawals, you will have the same options more or less.</p>
<p>You can rely on payment options such as ACH (eCheck), but not the prepaid card. PayPal is actually the preferred way of cashing out as it guarantees near-instant processing time and is a preferred option by many.</p>
<p>Overall, William Hill gets the banking side of things well enough and you will have no problem accessing your funds, topping up your bankroll, or simply cashing out your contest winnings.</p>
<p>William Hill Customer Service</p>
<p>Customer service is reliable as it’s helpful and William Hill employs an army of specialists who are trained to offer adequate and timely support. Consumers are welcome to use any of the available communication options, including the toll-free support number 855-754-1200, but also jump in a live chat, visit the HELP or FAQ sections, or simply refer to their question in an email.</p>
<p>Is William Hill Sportsbook Safe and Secure?</p>
<p>In terms of safety and reliability, William Hill shines as it always has. A company with close to an entire century of experience, the bookmaker is committed to upholding the highest standards in the industry, many of which it helped establish.</p>
<p>As such, you can trust William Hill and its ability to keep your data safe. Of course, reputation alone isn’t alone and that is why numerous state regulators, to name the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement and Nevada Gaming Control Board have approved what WH has to offer both as a retail and mobile sportsbook.</p>
<p>The security at the website and its various skins are further bolstered by the availability of SSL encryption and an advanced HTML5 platform to safeguards against any possible tripwires online.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>William Hill’s presence in the US sports betting market is considerable. The retail operations have quickly got a head start with the company capitalizing on markets such as the District of Columbia and focusing on rolling out a fully-fledged offer in numerous jurisdictions while mobile sports betting has been trying to catch up.</p>
<p>While other companies have been cautious not to over-invest, William Hill has brought a very British approach, launching numerous sports betting venues and in doing so, not just grabbing a big chunk of the sports betting handle but allowing ordinary Americans to find an excellent sports betting spot close by. Convenience and excellent odds are how William Hill Sportsbook has always done business, and this is not likely to start changing now.</p>
