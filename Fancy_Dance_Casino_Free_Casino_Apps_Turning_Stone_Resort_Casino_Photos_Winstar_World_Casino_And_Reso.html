    <h1>Fancy Dance Casino Free Casino Apps Turning Stone Resort Casino Photos Winstar World Casino And Reso</h1>

<p>Hi. As at 17.11.2021 I sent following email to several casinos including Bethard Group casinos (email attached), where I told about my gambling problem: "I kindly ask you to block my access to your site because of my gambling problem. If I have an account on your site, please close it permanently and stop all marketing. If I haven’t registered yet, please make your best effort to prevent me doing so. I hope this ban also applies to any of your "sister casinos" and possible future casinos".</p>
<p>As you can see, I requested self-exclusion if I have account, if not, please prevent opening one. Also I asked this request to apply all sister casinos.</p>
<p>Despite the self-exclusion email, I was able to register Supernopea as at 30.11.2021 and continued gambling in Supernopea until March 2022. I used the same email address in both sending the self-exclusion email and registering Supernopea.</p>
<p>Bethard Group and Supernopea have both admitted that they have received the email, but they say that they are not able to block me if I'm not registered already. It is not possible to register Supernopea without depositing money. Basically they claim that there is no way I can self-exclude without depositing money. For problem gambler this is absurd and wrong. According to MGA directive 2 of 2018:</p>
<p>"B2C licensees shall ensure that individuals not previously registered as players, but who have contacted the B2C licensee requesting to be excluded from any future gaming activity, are not allowed to make use of the B2C licensee’s gaming service, unless and until the B2C licensee has received a notice in written or electronic format from the same individual asking for their previous request to be ignored."</p>
<p>I have requested my net losses 4346€ to be refunded back to me, but they are refusing and saying: "we cant block someone who is not already registered". This is clearly against MGA directive and they must block me if I'm requesting it and apply the block to sister casinos if Im requesting it.</p>
<p>Please help me to get my net losses back. I have stopped gambling 5 months ago and received medical help to my disease. All money refunded would go directly to gambling related debt payments. There are two large Maltese casinos that have admitted their mistake and refunded me due to their misconduct (cases were exactly similar as this).</p>
<p>If you need anything else documentation, Im happy to provide them.</p>
