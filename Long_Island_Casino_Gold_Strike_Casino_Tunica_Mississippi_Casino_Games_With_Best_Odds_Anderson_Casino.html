    <h1>Long Island Casino Gold Strike Casino Tunica Mississippi Casino Games With Best Odds Anderson Casino</h1>

<p>Taking into account that the slots I played some of them did not have the option to bet 1BRL I was obliged to play 1.20BRL but for the purposes of the betting requirement the 1.20BRL plays were only worth 1BRL and even in the prints they sent you can check that in games where it was possible to play 1BRL I played that amount where it even shows that I won with a free spins bonus within the game. And besides, if it was not allowed to play above 1BRL this was not explicit, what happened is that any value exceeding 1BRL was not accounted for. So the Casino's justification is unfounded, in addition to what can be seen above they said that my suspension was due to the bad evaluation I made here at Guru, when my complaint and bad evaluation were precisely due to the suspension, so it could not be later than assessment.</p>
<p>The casino wants to absolve itself of guilt and not make the payment that is due since the bet options in the Slots I played did not allow me to play exactly one amount, in addition to the fact that no Casino that I have played until today has this odd rule of only being able to play exactly one amount otherwise you are penalized with account suspension.</p>
<p>If I had benefited by playing a higher amount, that's fine, I would never complain, but even playing 0.20BRL more, only 1BRL effectively counted for fulfilling the wagering requirements, so I was not benefited and I repeat I only played such amounts because in addition to not prohibit slots where the beta was not exactly the value they indicate, the fixed beta of the slot did not allow playing exactly the value of 1BRL.</p>
