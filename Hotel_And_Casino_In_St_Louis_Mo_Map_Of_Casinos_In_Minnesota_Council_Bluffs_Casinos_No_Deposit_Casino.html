<p>Global sports media business and leading provider of real-time sports updates LiveScore announced a ground-breaking deal to make Cristiano Ronaldo its Official Global Brand Ambassador.</p>
<p>“In a year that has seen LiveScore rapidly evolve as a global sports media business, this landmark new relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo is without doubt the biggest moment so far.” Ric Leask, Marketing Director, LiveScore</p>
<p>‘There is Simply No Bigger Sportsperson’</p>
<p>The agreement to see the five-time winner of football’s most prestigious individual award, Ballon d’Or, and one of the most famous footballers globally join its ranks is a significant step LiveScores made on its evolutionary path to becoming a major global sports media force.</p>
<p>“There is simply no bigger sportsperson — past or present — than Cristiano Ronaldo, who continues to captivate fans around the world with his brilliance on the pitch. With a world record 777 career goals and 31 club and international honours, we believe he truly is the ‘Greatest Of All Time’.” Ric Leask, Marketing Director, LiveScore</p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo will become the Official Global Brand Ambassador of LiveScore starting this summer ahead of the upcoming UEFA European Championship and will represent the brand for at least 2 domestic football seasons, including the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>
<p>“Combined with the fact that his game is built on speed, reliability and simplicity, key strengths also synonymous with the LiveScore brand, there could be no more authentic and better fit for our business.” Ric Leask, Marketing Director, LiveScore</p>
<p>Global Digital Initiatives</p>
<p>The partnership between the sports media and the prominent football player will focus on a global ATL creative campaign to leverage the worldwide popularity of Cristiano Ronaldo across LiveScore’s first TV spot as well as a digital campaign targeting vast global audiences. In addition, the image rights of the player will be used by LiveScore across its digital inventory and content to boost attractiveness for sports fans.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait to kick off our partnership and bring our global audience closer than ever to the GOAT.” Ric Leask, Marketing Director, LiveScore</p>
<p>Active across 200 territories worldwide, LiveScore will continue to captivate sports audiences with its premium content and product, and the addition of the high-profile figure will also look to connect with his social media followers, currently exceeding half a billion and representing a hugely relevant audience for the sports updates provider.</p>
<p>Speaking about his new role, Cristiano Ronaldo expressed his excitement to begin this natural partnership and outlined the importance LiveScore played in his life so far, having used its app for years to keep up to date with the latest scores.</p>
<p>Further, he expressed how LiveScore was there with him for his every goal to keep his fans informed about the moments that defined his football career.</p>
<p>“LiveScore and I are connected by a drive to be the greatest at what we do every single day. I cannot wait to unite our combined audiences of football fans with amazing content, moments and goals in the next exciting stage of my career.” Cristiano Ronaldo, Official Global Brand Ambassador, LiveScore</p>
<p>In March, Cristiano Ronaldo featured in a digital campaign produced as part of the arrangement between his football club Juventus and its official partner Parimatch.</p>
