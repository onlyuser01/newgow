<p>Leading sports wagering monitoring company US Integrity has sealed a deal with micro-betting-focused company Betr just in time for the latter’s launch on the Ohio market in January. While still in its growing stage, Betr has already kicked off a successful marketing campaign with the help of social media influencer and investor Jake Paul. The efforts paid off, resulting in hundreds of thousands of followers gathered by the company through different social media platforms.</p>
<p>US Integrity to Offer Integrity Monitoring Services to Betr</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, the company that provides top protection against corruption and fraud related to betting will fuel Betr with the necessary integrity monitoring services. This will be done with the help of a proprietary dashboard. US Integrity will also run complex analyses across large volumes of data in an attempt to spot any irregular wagering patterns or contest-level issues.</p>
<p>Betr’s head of product Alex Ursa spoke about the importance of sports betting experiences while expressing their thrill in regards to the new collaboration with US Integrity on the verge of launching their “revolutionary platform” in Ohio. Ursa further explained that US Integrity’s “proactive approach to maintaining integrity” will be critical for identifying wagering activities that might be suspicious. Betr was founded in 2022 by Jake Paul and Joey Levy as the pioneer direct-to-consumer sports wagering company with a focus on micro-betting. The company also has its own new media venture dedicated to the next generation of sports aficionados.</p>
<p>US Integrity, “Proud” to Partner With Betr</p>
<p>US Integrity’s chief executive officer and co-founder Matthew Holt explained the company was “proud to partner with Betr” and their “exceptional team” while supporting them in their growth on the American and Canadian regulated markets for sports betting. Holt added that US Integrity aims to offer zero-conflict conflict-free, state-of-the-art insights and comprehensive compliance services to all clients. The company has the support of a series of investors such as Las Vegas Sands and SeventySix Capital and it has also signed partnerships with some of the most popular professional sports leagues and collegiate conferences in the US. Their affiliation with important regulators in the gaming industry and licensed operators is further proof of their commitment to their work.</p>
<p>The company with headquarters in New York and Las Vegas explained all its partners are entirely committed to the “highest integrity standards,” adding that Betr is “no exception.” Furthermore, Holt described these partnerships as opportunities to guarantee integrity in sports betting and to further reinforce and develop their proprietary detection tools. Last week, US Integrity signed a partnership with Saracen Casino Resort, an operator that offers the biggest sportsbook in Arkansas. TonyBet also teamed up with US Integrity before its launch on the Ontario market before the end of the year.</p>
