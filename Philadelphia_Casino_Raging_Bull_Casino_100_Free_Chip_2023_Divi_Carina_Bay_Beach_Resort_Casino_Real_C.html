<p>The Chicago Bears just seem incapable of waking up from their sleep. They are 2-4 in the 2022 NFL season, with more losses (probably) coming their way in the near future. By ‘near future’ we mean Monday night, which is when they play their Week 7 game against the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>The MNF game is taking place at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, where the Pats have all wins against the Bears. They lead the all-time series 4-0, but none of those wins happened in the post-Brady era. Still, this shouldn’t worry them much as their 2022 QB should be able to put on a decent performance in the MNF game.</p>
<p>But who’s going to be – Mac Jones or Bailey Zappe? We don’t think it matters much. Whoever gets picked by Bill Belichick will probably do well against Chicago. And even if they don’t do well, New England’s defense should be able to make up for the offensive mistakes.</p>

<p>Chicago’s Offensive Weapons Don’t Look Very Lethal</p>
<p>The Chicago Bears just don’t have very good offensive weapons in their arsenal. They’re bottom in the NFL in passing yards per game after six game weeks. Further, with just 15.5 points scored per game, they’re second worst in the league (and the very worst team in the NFC).</p>
<p>Rather surprisingly, their quarterback Justin Fields isn’t the one to blame for Chicago’s disastrous offensive performances. He’s thrown for 869 yards for four TDs and five interceptions. That’s not great but the reason why it happened is that his teammates just haven’t been providing him with enough support.</p>
<p>This goes especially for the ones who were supposed to protect him. Chicago’s offensive line has allowed 23 sacks. That number could’ve been even higher if Fields wasn’t skillful enough to avoid opposition players charging at him. Unfortunately for him, he might not be able to dodge too many sacks by the Pats defense on Monday night.</p>
<p>Jones or Zappe? Who Cares!</p>
<p>The Patriots are 3-3 in the 2022 NFL season, which is actually a very good record considering that their schedule has been pretty ugly so far. The reason behind their good stats is the fact that their defensive team has been superb, especially in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>For instance, in the previous game, they conceded only 15 points against the Cleveland Browns. A game before, they shut out the Detroit Lions, winning the game 29-0.</p>
<p>Their offense has also been great, which is even more surprising considering that they were led by third-string QB Bailey Zappe after starter Mac Jones got injured. Zappe’s been great as their signal-caller, but he’ll probably step away in the MNF game as Jones seems ready to make his comeback.</p>
<p>Chicago Bears vs New England Patriots Prediction</p>
<p>We’re sure The New England Patriots are going to do a wonderful job on Monday Night, so it’s just up to their offense not to mess up royally. Even with a below-par performance by their offense, the Pats should still get a win.</p>
<p>Still, we do think New England’s offense will put on a decent show at Gillette Stadium, especially if Mac Jones comes back to the field.</p>
<p>Picks: New England Patriots to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
