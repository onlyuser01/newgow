    <h1>Tunica Casino Hotels Online Casinos Michigan Ruby Fortune Casino Goldfish Casino Slots Shreveport La</h1>

<p>Stake.com, the crypto-based online casino, announced its sponsorship of the upcoming boxing event, which will take place on June 7 at the Saitama Super Arena in Tokyo, which can hold up to 36,000 fans and has previously hosted other high-profile UFC and NBA matches. Japanese viewers will also be able to watch the fight on Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>This Rematch Is a Continuation of 2019’s Legendary Fight</p>
<p>The previous clash between Naoya Inoue and Nonito Donaire was one of the most spectacular and dramatic fights of 2019, and fans are eager for more. Inoue won the previous match via unanimous decision, but 39 years old Donaire remains one of the best fighters in the bantamweight class. Donaire’s victory over Nordine Oubaali netted him the WBC belt. He followed this up by defeating Reymart Gaballo and proved that he remains a force to be reckoned with despite his age. Inoue currently holds the WBA and IBF bantamweight titles, which means this fight will be for three of the four recognized championships at 118 lbs.</p>
<p>“Expect a greater fight than last time,” wrote Inoue in his fight announcement on Instagram. Since his win over Donaire, Inoue has fought three times. He first claimed a solid victory against Jason Moloney in 2020 and then proceeded to crush mandatory challengers Michael Dasmarinas and Araen Dipaen in 2021.</p>
<p>Stake.com entered the world of high-profile sports sponsorships in January 2021 when UFC fighter Israel Adesanya became the brand’s ambassador. Since then, the gaming operator has put its name on the shirts of UK soccer team Watford F.C, followed by a deal with Argentine footballer Sergio Agüero. Formula One driver Pietro Fittipaldi and his brother, Formula Two driver Enzo Fittipaldi became brand ambassadors in Brazil for the 2022 racing season. In March 2022, Stake.com signed an exclusive live-streaming deal with Canadian musician Drake. The online casino brand’s most recent sponsorship was this April’s boxing match between Gennady Golovkin and Ryōta Murata.</p>
<p>As the official betting partner of the event, Stake.com branding will be heavily prominent both ringside and across the territory of the venue. The gambling operator will also use the opportunity to offer its client various promotional offers relating to the fight. “We’re delighted to continue to support the biggest events in boxing across the globe and are very excited to become the official betting partner for Naoya Inoue vs Nonito Donaire,” stated Dominic Rae, Sponsorships Manager for Stake.com. He expressed his hopes that the upcoming fight will be just as spectacular as Inoue and Donaire’s first clash. The stakes for this rematch are certainly higher with multiple titles on the line and two fighters who have both continued to excel after their previous encounter in the ring.</p>
