<p>EveryMatrix has won a crucial public tender that will allow the company to deliver its full range of titles and products to Veikkaus, the Finnish state-owned gaming company, which has been looking to award a major contract to the right partner. It turns out that EveryMatrix is that partner.</p>
<p>The company will be the official content supplier for Veikkaus over the next six years and will provide the company with its CasinoEngine solution, among others. EveryMatrix will also bring the iGaming Integration provider to the fore, opening up access for Veikkaus and the company’s players to titles and products by no fewer than 65 different game providers.</p>
<p>However, as the partnership carries on, both companies are confident that they are going to be expanding their reach and adding more content. EveryMatrix does not serve as a mere aggregator of content, though. The company is equally capable of delivering on worthwhile solutions that it has developed itself. These include products by Spearhead Studios and Armadillo Studios.</p>
<p>Veikkaus is an important partner for EveryMatrix as it would give the company the opportunity to reach no fewer than two million customers. According to Veikkaus’ most recent numbers, it is popular with at least two million people in Finland and the company is even considering expanding its products abroad.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix will feature titles from SlotMatrix which will be stocking Veikkaus’ virtual gaming shelves. All in all, the tender is a very big achievement for the company. EveryMatrix CCO Stian Hornsletten said that his company considers this to be a major milestone and one that will allow the state-owned monopoly to truly innovate its content portfolio and bring fresh opportunities to its players.</p>
<p>"Our team looks forward to supporting Veikkaus in their journey, and we are keen to get started as soon as possible," Hornsletten said. Veikkaus CPO Jan Hagelberg welcomed the news in a similarly upbeat tone and said that the company was very happy to have what he described as an amazing opportunity and see Finnish casino players access EveryMatrix’s trove of gaming titles.</p>
<p>There will be thousands of new opportunities for Veikkaus players to explore. Hagelberg didn’t spare EveryMatrix compliments. "EveryMatrix’s full-service platform offers us one of the industry’s best catalogs of games, including its proprietary in-house portfolio," he concluded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, EveryMatrix posted its quarterly results about a week ago, with the company reporting strong results in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
