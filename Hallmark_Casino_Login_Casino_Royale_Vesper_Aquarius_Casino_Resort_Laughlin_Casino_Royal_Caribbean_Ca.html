    <h1>Hallmark Casino Login Casino Royale Vesper Aquarius Casino Resort Laughlin Casino Royal Caribbean Ca</h1>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>I have a few questions about gambling addiction! I've been playing online casino for about 5 years and I'm actually addicted to it! As soon as I start playing, I have trouble stopping! In contrast to many others, the extent of the problem is reasonably manageable for me! That means I don't gamble away more than I can afford! Nevertheless, you can spend your money elsewhere (better) especially in times like these! So I must have had around 200 casino accounts blocked! Banned account = no chance to play!</p>
<p>Now some questions that arise:</p>
<p>1.) Do other casinos see that I have that many bans?</p>
<p>2.) What can I do if casinos refuse to block me? Today, for example, I found another casino (happyspins) that refused my ban! Cost me a loss of 475 euros! I know: it's your own fault! But when I play, then...</p>
<p>3.) What do I do with casinos that constantly bother me with advertising and thus contribute significantly to my gaming problem?</p>
<p>4.) Online casinos in Austria are illegal (with one single exception)! Can someone give me a tip on how I can take legal action against the casinos here?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your tips and information</p>
<p>LG Ares</p>
