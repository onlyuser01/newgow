<p>Interactive sports betting and gaming company Elys Game Technology released its first quarter 2022 financial report to reveal a revenue slump year-over-year and marginal sequential growth.</p>
<p>Revenue Decreased due to Italy Land-Based Closures</p>
<p>Nasdaq-listed Elys Game Technology generated for the three months ended March 31, 2022 GAAP revenue of $12.2 million, down 14% when compared to $14.2 million in Q1 2021 and 5% up to Q4 2021.</p>
<p>The company stated in the report that the decrease in revenue year-over-year was due to the closure of its land-based locations in Italy from June 2021, highly anticipating to regaining this market share by deploying land-based operations in new locations in the country in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>Michele Ciavarella, Executive Chairman of Elys Game Technology, did not comment on the decrease in revenue year-over-year and instead, focused on other key metrics such as turnover.</p>
<p>“Elys continues to improve on its performance with another strong quarter achieving a turnover growth of $2.7 million over an already strong Q4-2021 performance,” he said, attributing the growth to the company’s online betting channel in Italy and an “improvement in service revenues” on a sequential basis.</p>
<p>Non-GAAP betting handle, or turnover, in Q1 2022 amounted to $217.6 million, slightly improving the Q4 2021 reading of 214.9 million, while gross gaming revenue hold improved from 6.8% in Q4 2021 to 7% in the reported quarter. Across sportsbook, the disaggregated hold continued to perform in the double digits at an exemplary 18.3% in the quarter.</p>
<p>Costs Decreased but Loss more than Doubled</p>
<p>On the costs and expenses side, Elys registered selling expenses of $9.3 million, down 6% to $9.9 million in Q4 2021, representing 4.3% of turnover as compared to 4.6% in Q4 2021.</p>
<p>The decrease in selling expenses drove total costs and expenses down to $14.3 million, down 3.37% to $14.8 million in Q1 2021 but that was not enough and Elys ended the quarter with a loss of $2.1 million, up 250% to $0.6 million loss in Q1 2021.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results, interim chief financial officer of Elys Carlo Reali started by outlining the defensive strategy the Toronto-based company implemented in Italy to target growth towards Multigioco online operations which significantly reduced handle and revenue from retail.</p>
<p>“As part of our B2C operational strategy in Italy, the second stage of growth began in Q1-2022 where we acquired approximately 50 ADM land-based license rights, and which we expect to increase by an additional 50 rights over the coming 12 to 18 months that are instrumental in re-deploying our retail distribution in Italy.” Carlo Reali, interim CFO, Elys Game Technology</p>
<p>Reali continued by outlining expectations that the investment in land-based operations “could generate additional revenue of approximately $20 million per year” and help the business return to pre-pandemic levels without further increasing the costs.</p>
<p>Reali also believes additional B2B revenue could be generated through the certification of Elys’ Italian sportsbook and Virtual Generation virtual sports platform.</p>
<p>Following the release of the report, Elys share price fell from $1.28 to $1.15 and is currently trading at $1.18.</p>
