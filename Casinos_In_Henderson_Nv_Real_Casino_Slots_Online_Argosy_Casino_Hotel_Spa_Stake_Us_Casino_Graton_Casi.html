<p>Veikkaus, the Finnish state monopoly on iGaming, has added ten new games by Pragmatic Play, an established supplier of casino games. Moving forward, players at the Veikkaus Oy brand will have access to award-winning titles such as Gates of Olympus, Sugar Rush, The Dog House Megaways, and not least, Big Bass Bonanza, among a few other excellent gems.</p>
<p>The move gives Pragmatic Play a further opportunity to strengthen its presence in European markets and establish its games as some of the best on the continent. Commenting on this new opportunity, Pragmatic Play Chief Operating Officer Irina Cornides said that her company was absolutely thrilled to bring Pragmatic’s distinct portfolio of games to Finland for the very first time.</p>
<p>"Not only does the deal signal our continued growth in regulated markets across Europe, but it also highlights our shared commitment to player protection and corporate social responsibility," she added. She hailed Veikkaus for its own commitment of creating a safe and entertainment ecosystem for its players in the country and confirmed that Pragmatic Play will work with the operator to ensure that this goal is met in full.</p>
<p>Veikkaus Chief Product Officer Jan Hagelberg was similarly pleased with the opportunity to add even more exciting content for players and cement Veikkaus Oy’s position as the leading operator for Finnish Players. The company is naturally also focusing on building a safe experience as it goes along, and to this end, Pragmatic Play has been one of the best choices, Hagelberg noted.</p>
<p>Veikkaus is de facto the leader in the market as previously, Finland had Fintoto, Finland’s Slot Machine Association and Veikkaus merge into a single operator in 2017. Now, Veikkaus is owned by the state itself and there is a clear and unfaltering commitment to building a more robust and safer gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p>Veikkaus has also been looking to strengthen its content footprint with a number of other content providers as well. Among those is EveryMatrix, with the two companies partnering back in 2022. At the same time, Finland is ever-vigilant about the presence of unauthorized third-party operators</p>
<p>Recently, the National Police Board has told Betsson AB and specifically a subsidiary, BML Group Ltd, to stop marketing its services in the country. Finland is also discussing the possibility of opening up its market and making it more accessible to third-party operators.</p>
