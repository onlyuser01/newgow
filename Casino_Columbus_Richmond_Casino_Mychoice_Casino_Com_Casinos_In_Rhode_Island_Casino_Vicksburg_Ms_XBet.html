<p>Xbet Sports will probably feel and look familiar, and this is by design. The sportsbook is the alter ego of MyBookie.ag, another respected online sports betting site with years on the market and a lot to offer. Well, if MyBookie is one of the top bookmakers for US bettors, why is then Xbet.ag necessary?</p>
<p>That is a great question and we will answer at length in our dedicated Xbet Sports review, in a moment. For now, it suffices to say that the sportsbook made an entry in August 2014 and quickly grew to prominence with U.S. residents.</p>
<p>The website is based in the Canadian Indian territory, exempting it from certain legal pet peeves, while the management is based in San Jose, Costa Rica. Xbet stands out with all of its features. Not least, the brand offers a dedicated live casino which you can visit if you ever feel the need to take a short break from sports betting.</p>
<p>Why Choose XBet?</p>
<p>Modeled after its sibling, Xbet offers a great variety of features making it simple for you to benefit from competitive odds and early markets. There is a large variety of sports bets as Xbet pays for a great API and gets its data quickly and accurately.</p>
<p>Overall, the sportsbook has been on the market long enough to establish itself as a trusted operator. We made sure to check for any negative feedback from Xbet customers, but in the years since it launched, the company’s name has not been involved in any controversy.</p>
<p>We can safely say that Xbet sets a good standard for the rest of the industry. Previously, the sportsbook was too new, but today Xbet achieves new heights by posting competitive odds and a great set of bonus opportunities and admittedly having the weight of time to back its offer up.</p>
<p>Xbet Sportsbook: Odds, Markets, and Lines</p>
<p>Xbet has a lot to offer to new and established bettors. The betting interface is quick with a dynamic bet slip handily placed in the top right corner. Bettors can always redeem a bonus code by punching it in the Promo Code field.</p>
<p>The overall interface allows for a lot of control over the website, starting with a Quick Access links which allow you to land in relevant and in-demand pages, such as:</p>
<p>Score Big Bonuses</p>
<p>Live Casino</p>
<p>Recent Contests</p>
<p>Box Scores</p>
<p>The left-hand-side menu is far more important though. It’s there where you will find all currently active and available to bet on markets, listed under Featured. Under Betting Lines, bettors can take a closer look at other available markets they can explore.</p>
<p>These events feature popular sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, horse racing, rugby, MMA, NBA, NCAAB, NCAAF, table tennis, boxing, golf, NHL, NFL, and many others. You will even find alternative sports betting markets such as Entertainment and U.S. Politics.</p>
<p>Did You Know? Xbet will let you choose your time zone, picking from Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, and Pacific Time. You can also adjust the odds format and choose from American, Fractional, and Decimal.</p>
<p>As a bettor, you will be able to pick from the holy trinity of betting options, i.e. Spread, Moneyline, Total, and numerous Proposition bets. One thing we find great about Xbet Sports is the alternative bets you can place on specific developments about a popular event.</p>
<p>Some events can have as many as 60 prop bets for example, and you can combine all sorts of accumulators to build the bet that offers you the biggest return.</p>
<p>Xbet Sports Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>There are many ways to increase the size of your bankroll when you arrive at Xbet Sports. Whether you are a new user or an established one, there is always some bonus to benefit from just as well. We will go into some details about the bonuses right now.</p>
<p>Xbet Sports $300 Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>The Xbet Sports Welcome Bonus is a great way to get Free Play money. The initial deposit you place will be matched by 50% and up to $300. To activate the bonus, you will need to deposit at least $45. The other important details about the bonus have to do with the terms and bonus code.</p>
<p>Promo Code : XBET50</p>
<p>: XBET50 Rollover: 7x</p>
<p>Sports Reload Bonus up to $250</p>
<p>Next on the menu, you have a $250 reload bonus which will let you top up your bankroll any time you feel there is a need to. To qualify for the bonus, you must make a minimum deposit worth at least $100.</p>
<p>Promo Code : XB25</p>
<p>: XB25 Rollover: 5x</p>
<p>7% Horse Rebate</p>
<p>If you love the ponies, the 7% Horse Rebate bonus by Xbet Sports is the right fit for you. The rebates are paid daily after midnight, but Win, Place and Show tickets that pay under $2.20 to $2 or less won’t be part of the promotion. The amount paid will vary based on the track.</p>
<p>Refer a Friend</p>
<p>Xbet.ag Sports encourages you to bring your friends over, especially if you think the online betting site is worth the trouble. Referring your fellow sports bettors is a simple and pleasant enough job. All you need to do is share the referral link via email, social media, or SMS and ask them to join.</p>
<p>Once they do, you will stand to gain a 100% matched bonus up to $100. You may refer as many people as you want, as there is no set limit on the referrals.</p>
<p>Xbet Betting Limits: Generous and Flexible</p>
<p>Whether you tend to bet a little more by default or prefer a more conservative approach, it never hurts to have higher betting limits. Xbet.ag Sports delivers on what is often cited as one of the key strengths of sportsbook – i.e. flexible thresholds and ceilings.</p>
<p>Xbet usually allows bettors to wager up to $1,000 on a single event before it starts, but then again, the number is reduced to $500 for live wagers. There isn’t a maximum payout, though, but a wager may be returned to you at the discretion of the sportsbook.</p>
<p>Banking Options</p>
<p>Xbet Sports has very flexible banking options, allowing you to bank with small amounts at first, but also offering high rollers</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>Minimum deposit : $25</p>
<p>: $25 Deposit methods : Visa, Mastercard, Bitcoin, MoneyGram, eCheck, Zelle, Cash App</p>
<p>: Visa, Mastercard, Bitcoin, MoneyGram, eCheck, Zelle, Cash App Currencies: BTC, USD</p>
<p>Xbet Sports offers several payment options to allow you to settle deposits and withdrawals quickly and efficiently. With sports bettors mostly focus on the unfolding events, knowing you can sort out a deposit or a withdrawal quickly, using a set of innovative payment options, such as Bitcoin, bank cards, eCheck, and even Cash App is a relief. Here are the available payment options at Xbet when you are looking to make a deposit:</p>
<p>Deposit Method Min Deposit Max Deposit Bitcoin $25 $10,000 Credit Card $45 $2,500 MoneyGram $100 $630 eCheck $100 $2,500 Zelle $249.99 $999.99 Cash App $50 $10,000</p>
<p>The sportsbook will allow you to bet any amount you feel comfortable with as long as it’s between $25 and $10,000 which are the minimum and maximum amounts allowed to bet presently. Bitcoin clearly gets a lot of traction as the cryptocurrency can avoid slow processing times and offer an expedient deposit instead.</p>
<p>Bitcoin carries no additional fees and it will save you the hassle of converting your FIAT money into USD, for example. If you choose to deposit with Master Card or Visa, Xbet Sports will cover any transactional fees for you, making sure you don’t have to pay extra to enjoy the experience.</p>
<p>Payout Options</p>
<p>To really have fun while placing a bet, you want to know that your winnings are only hours away from appearing in your bank account. Knowing how important it is for you to transfer money quickly, Xbet Sports has made sure to only list the most relevant and quickest payment options.</p>
<p>As a result, you will be able to cash out using Bitcoin, eCheck, and Bank Wires. Each transaction will take a different amount of time, with Bitcoin usually processed within 24 hours. There are zero fees to the bettors this way. If you prefer to use FIAT currencies, you can opt for both eCheck and Bank Wires which will take between five and 10 business days on average. Here are the specific transfer windows:</p>
<p>Bitcoin – 24 hours</p>
<p>– 24 hours ECheck – 5-7 business days</p>
<p>– 5-7 business days Bank Wire – 5-7 business days</p>
<p>Each payment method allows you to withdraw a minimum and maximum amount and the good news is those amounts are very flexible and able to accommodate players of all budgets. Here we have put a table for you to reference when you want to quickly see how much you can withdraw:</p>
<p>Deposit Method Min Deposit Max Deposit Bitcoin $25 $5,000 Echeck $50 $3,000 Wire Transfer $500 $5,000</p>
<p>Obviously, Bitcoin is the quickest and most flexible currency you can use, but if you don’t mind cashing out slightly bigger amounts, Wire Transfers may be the cleanest and quickest way to do so. If you are willing to study BTC cashouts a bit, you will find the cashing out process even further simplified down the road.</p>
<p>Live Sports Betting</p>
<p>Another way to have a great time with the sportsbook is to opt for the In-play betting markets. Xbet runs a great live betting option, allowing you to place your wagers while an event is in progress.</p>
<p>Naturally, this type of betting is a little more challenging and not recommended for someone who’s just starting with sports betting. You will just as easily be able to place props, spreads, and money lines bets on in-play markets as you would be with future and pre-match bets.</p>
<p>A Mobile Platform Optimized for All</p>
<p>The mobile experience is important to all, and Xbet lives up to this well. Android, iOS, Mac, and desktop users will find it easy to navigate the markets, pick events they want to bet on, and place wagers with surgical precision. There are no dedicated mobile apps at the present moment, but making simple sports bets should be simple enough.</p>
<p>Quick and Reliable Customer Support</p>
<p>Obviously, you will want to make sure that your betting experience ticks over without any complications. What better way to ensure this other than tapping into a reliable customer support system? Xbet has set up all the necessary communications to provide you with timely and worthwhile support:</p>
<p>24/7 Live Chat Available</p>
<p>Call Xbet phone number at 1-888-426-3661</p>
<p>Email the sportsbook and get a response within 24 hours</p>
<p>Bottom Line</p>
<p>Xbet is a fine choice for anyone looking to bet on sports. As a sister website to MyBookie, the bookie had to come up with its own unique identity, which it has achieved well.</p>
<p>The markets and odds are dynamic and competitive. You will find the overall experience very satisfactory, benefit from excellent sports betting bonuses and codes, and generally enjoy a bonanza of available betting markets.</p>
