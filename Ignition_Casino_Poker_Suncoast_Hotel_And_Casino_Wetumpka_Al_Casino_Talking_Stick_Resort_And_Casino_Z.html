<p>Sports betting radio network and streaming TV channel Vegas Stats &amp; Information Network (VSiN), The Sports Betting Network has signed an agreement with Hubbard Radio in Seattle. The partnership will allow radio listeners to get access to sports betting content for the first time throughout Seattle. At the moment, The Sports Betting Network is on air on more than 140 radio stations spread across 33 US states. Some of the network’s freshest affiliation deals include Kansas City, Dallas, Honolulu, Rochester, and Providence.</p>
<p>KNUC-FM 98.9-HD2 to Launch the Pioneer 24-hour Sports Betting Format in Seattle</p>
<p>VSiN will be delivering the content to the station, with a strong focus on sports news and deep analysis generated by reputable bookmakers and sports betting pros. At the same time, KNUC-FM’s sister station KIXI-AM 880 will start to air Action Updates two times a day on weekdays, along with “VsiN Prime Time”, a radio show hosted by Tim Murray, co-host at VSiNLive Primetime 6-9 pm ET and podcast host for VSiN’s CFB Betting podcast, along with ex-National Football League quarterback and South Florida’s current running backs coach Shaun King.</p>
<p>Great Opportunity to Capitalize on the fast Expansion of Sports Betting</p>
<p>Hubbard Radio Seattle’s market manager Trip Reeb spoke about the “incredible growth” recorded by sports betting in the last few years, explaining why the radio station thought it would be an excellent chance to harness the potential of the fast expansion and capitalize on the expert content delivered by VSiN.</p>
<p>At the same time, VSiN’s chief executive officer and founder Brian Musburger explained VSiN was “thrilled” to start working with the radio station to introduce “relevant, 24/7 sports betting coverage” to sports aficionados across Seattle for the very first time.</p>
<p>Reuniting KNUC’s powerful signal in the radio market with the “leading voice in sports betting” is expected to help VSiN deliver all the necessary analysis and insights for sports bettors in Seattle to make better-informed betting decisions. At the moment, VSiN, The Sports Betting Network, offers a nonstop stream of entertainment content and information relevant for both seasons and brand-new bettors.</p>
<p>VSiN was officially launched in 2017 by Brian Musburger, a talent agent, attorney Todd Musburger, and Dave Berg, a producer of documentaries. Broadcaster Brent Musburger joined in as the leading on-air personality soon after he bid goodbye to ESPN at the beginning of 2017. VSiN was launched on February 5 and its first day on air heavily focused on covering the Super Bowl. While VSiN carries its programming using its own website, it also syndicates its programming using local regional radio stations and sports networks. In June, VSiN expanded its team of award-winning oddsmakers, broadcasters, and managers with sports media veteran Len Mead who was appointed new general manager.</p>
