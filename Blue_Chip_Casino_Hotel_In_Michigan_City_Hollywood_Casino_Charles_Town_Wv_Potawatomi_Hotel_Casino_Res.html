<p>The leading platform provider and operator group, Soft2Bet, announced it secured an important license, strengthening its presence in Europe. The company said Wednesday it secured approval for a business-to-business (B2B) permit from the gambling regulator in Sweden, the Swedish Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>The approval granted by the regulator, also famous as Spelinspektionen, gives the company the advantage of enhancing its business-to-customer side as well. As a result, Soft2Bet will continue to expand and improve its sportsbook and online casino websites that include CampoBet, YoyoCasino, as well as Betinia, a statement released on May 3, 2023, reveals.</p>
<p>‚ÄçSoft2Bet's General Counsel, David Yatom, shared his excitement about the latest announcement. He said: "Soft2Bet has been focused on the Swedish market for quite some time now and so, we are pleased to be cementing our footprint in the Swedish market both in the B2B and B2C spheres." Finally, Yatom explained: "This is a terrific achievement for the company which will be followed by many others."</p>
<p>According to Soft2Bet, the Swedish B2B license represents a major milestone. The company acknowledged that all of its aforementioned brands will benefit from that approval. However, Soft2Bet predicted that Betinia, the latest brand launched by the company, will benefit the most from the approval, considering that its popularity within the market continues to grow.</p>
<p>The popular platform provider explained that the new license from Spelinspektionen is valid for five years starting from July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2028. Soft2Bet said that the Swedish Gambling Authority's permit will enable it to join forces with new operators. At the same time, the company will have the option to provide its wide range of portfolio to existing clients.</p>
<p>The company's partners in Sweden will benefit from a portfolio consisting of more than 4000 casino games from 60 of the most popular and leading providers within the vertical. Through integration, the titles provided by Soft2Bet can help significantly expand the offering of partner operators.</p>
<p>Lately, Soft2Bet isn't the only gambling provider that secured a license from Spelinspektionen. Booming Games recently confirmed it secured a B2B license from the gambling watchdog.</p>
<p>Last month, Pariplay, the leading aggregation platform that is also a part of NeoGames, revealed it was awarded a B2B supplier license from Spelinspektionen as well. This enabled the company to continue to provide its leading services for operators within the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The licenses come ahead of new regulations that are planned to come into effect this summer. Starting in July, iGaming content providers in Sweden will be required to have a license from the Swedish Gambling Authority.</p>
