<p>Cincinnati Bengals vs. Pittsburgh Steelers is the Saturday afternoon game of Week 16. The two AFC North rivals are battling for a chance to challenge a wild card playoff spot</p>
<p>Neither the Cincinnati Bengals nor the Pittsburgh Steelers can win the AFC North this season, but both teams still stand a chance to make the playoffs through the wild card.</p>
<p>The Bengals are in a slightly better position as they’ve got an 8-6 record, while the Steelers are 7-7. However, they’re not miles apart, which is why their Week 16 duel on Saturday afternoon is of huge importance.</p>

<p>Cincinnati Bengals Doing Well Even Without Joe Burrow</p>
<p>The Bengals have got a new star – Jake Browning. The quarterback who stepped in when Joe Burrow got injured has been sensational so far. He threw for at least one touchdown in each of his last five games, with his last two seeing him throw for two TDs.</p>
<p>He did get an interception in each of his last two games, as well as made some dubious decisions. Some of those, however, resulted in a good thing for the Bengals. The best example is the throw that resulted in a TD by Tee Higgins which took the game to overtime, which Cincinnati ended up winning with a field goal.</p>
<p>It was the Bengals’ third straight win, the previous two happening against the Indianapolis Colts and the Jacksonville Jaguars. As a result, Cincinnati is 8-6 right now, meaning that Zac Taylor’s men now stand a good chance of making the postseason.</p>
<p>Of course, their job still isn’t done, but they’ll get closer to securing the playoff ticket with a win on Saturday. In fact, this is a must-win game for the Bengals given that in the other two games of the 2023 regular season, they play against the Kansas City Chiefs and the Cleveland Browns.</p>
<p>Last Chance for the Pittsburgh Steelers</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers are 7-7 right now, but their odds of making the playoffs do not look as great. The thing is that there are many other teams with a better record. Further, the Steelers are in horrible form with four losses in the last five games.</p>
<p>Still, the worst thing is that the Steelers have three relatively tough games to play before the end of the regular season. After the game with the Bengals, they play against the Seahawks in Seattle, while in the final round, they take on the Ravens in Baltimore.</p>
<p>The good news for their fans is that these guys tend to show up in big games. This season, we saw them beat the Bengals once, as well as the Ravens, Rams, etc.</p>
<p>Cincinnati Bengals vs. Pittsburgh Steelers Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a very close game as both teams will be 100% motivated to win. Both teams are great defensively, so don’t expect to see many points. Still, it’s the Bengals’ offense that’s much more talented, which is the reason why they’re our pick.</p>
<p>Pick: Cincinnati Bengals -2.5 (-105)</p>
