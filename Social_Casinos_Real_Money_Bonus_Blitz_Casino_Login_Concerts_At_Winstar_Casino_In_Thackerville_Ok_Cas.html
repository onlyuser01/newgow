<p>The American sports streaming platform, FuboTV has completed a massive deal in which it gained exclusive broadcasting rights for the Premier League (EPL) in Canada. Starting in the 2022/2023 season, Canadians will be able to watch every Premier League match for the next three seasons.</p>
<p>The EPL is Among the Most Prestigious Soccer Competitions in the World</p>
<p>This marks a huge milestone for FuboTV as the EPL is arguably the most prestigious and most popular soccer league in the world. To make things even better, the company recently stated that the preliminary Q4 results had exceeded its expectations as the revenue is likely to be higher than the one that was originally projected.</p>
<p>Premier League’s popularity and influence were confirmed by the CEO and co-founder of FuboTV, David Gandler. He said that this competition is considered to be the best in the world and has a massive following in Canada. Gandler also added that FuboTV gains another “top-notch property,” and it differentiates its offering even more with the deal. Doing so gives Canadian sports fans the chance to watch exciting sports content.</p>
<p>Starting from the 2022/2023 season, FuboTV will carry all Premier League matches, 380 in total, all the way through 2024/2025. Canadian sports fans will be able to enjoy the matches on the FuboTV live streaming platform and its Fubo Sports Network linear channel.</p>
<p>Premier League’s chief media officer, Paul Molnar, had a few nice things to say about the deal and FuboTV. He noted that the EPL is pleased to partner with the company, and Molnar is pleased to know that FuboTV considers the EPL to be an important mix in the Canadian market, where there are numerous passionate fans. He ended by saying that he’s looking forward to the partnership and working together to bring EPL’s excitement to “both new and existing fans.” The terms of the deal have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>FuboTV Solidifies Its Spot as Top Soccer Streaming Platform in Canada</p>
<p>A few months before acquiring the rights to the EPL, FuboTV gained exclusive rights to another top-tier soccer competition – the Italian Serie A and Coppa Italia. Not only that, but the company holds exclusive streaming rights to all of Club Deportivo Guadalajara’s Liga MX home matches.</p>
<p>These recent achievements solidified the company’s spot as the top soccer streaming platform in the country as it already streams popular sports and entertainment channels such as beIN Sports and One Soccer. They feature coverage of Canadian National Men’s Soccer, Ligue 1, and the Canadian Premier League.</p>
<p>The previous platform that had the EPL streaming rights in Canada was DAZN, but it lost its rights in the same week reports surfaced that it was preparing to acquire BT Sport. With the $800-million takeover, DAZN shifted its focus to Europe and thus, gave FuboTV the chance to advance in Canada and climb up the ranks.</p>
