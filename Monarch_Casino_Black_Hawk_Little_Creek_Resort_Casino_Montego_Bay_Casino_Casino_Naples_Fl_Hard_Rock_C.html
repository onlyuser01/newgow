<p>Fishin' For Gold review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Ice fishing is an uncomfortable sport in which people traipse out onto frozen over bodies of water, drill a hole in the ice and drop their hooks through. If you like the sound of that, but would rather miss out on the hypothermia, Fishin' For Gold has you covered.</p>
<p>In place of fish, players are looking to land coins, and instead of dropping the lines themselves, a cast of anthropomorphised penguins, polar bears, walruses and – for some unfathomable reason – lions do the fishing on the player’s behalf.</p>
<p>This allows players to have a pleasant outdoor excursion without getting up from their couch.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are excellent. Plenty of time, effort, and digital paint was clearly spent on making the characters have some personality, while the background details work with the reels to create a sense of setting.</p>
<p>The animations are not fancy, but they do their job with admirable solidity and clarity.</p>
<p>The music is rather annoying after it loops a few times, though the spin and win sounds are nice enough, they add little and do not especially help the slot feel coherent.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fishin' For Gold is a five reel, three row slot with twenty five win lines.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature, but the bonus wheel (described below) creates a constant sense of progress and allows for regular opportunities to switch things up.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>In Fishin' For Gold’s base game, there is no Wild symbol. There is however a Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter only appears on reels 2, 3 and 4. If the player lands a Scatter on all three reels at once, then the Bonus Game is triggered.</p>
<p>The game has a wheel which can be spun (at a cost equal to the player's current bet per spin). Landing the arrow on the green wedge of the wheel will trigger the Bonus Game. The wheel starts off with a 0% chance of winning the Bonus.</p>
<p>When the player lands two Scatters on one spin, the chance increases by one percentage point each time. The wheel can be spun at any point. After the player spins the wheel, the chance resets to 0%.</p>
<p>Should the player trigger the Bonus – either by spinning the wheel or by hitting three Scatters – then they are presented with a choice of fishermen. This fisherman will then hook a selection of symbols that award the player a randomised number of free spins or a symbol which will be Wild for the length of the free spins.</p>
<p>Additional free spins can be won by hitting three Gone Fishing symbols during the Free Spin Bonus.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.05%, almost exactly the same as our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€25.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it an excellent match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Fishin' For Gold is a fun cartoony slot with enough character to charm its players and some nice features. The music isn’t great, but the visuals and animations do the job.</p>
<p>The reasonable RTP and high volatility make it useful to players who are following our slot strategies.</p>
<p>The bonus game in particular is worth noting, with its randomised multipliers and spins. As is the bonus wheel that offers players a regular chance to gamble on going big.</p>
