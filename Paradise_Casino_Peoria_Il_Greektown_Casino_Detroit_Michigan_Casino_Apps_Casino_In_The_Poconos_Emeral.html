    <h1>Paradise Casino Peoria Il Greektown Casino Detroit Michigan Casino Apps Casino In The Poconos Emeral</h1>

<p>Greentube is not letting up in the content game as the supplier moves in to accomplish another important milestone in the United States. The company, which operates under the Novomatic umbrella, has become a content powerhouse in some of the fastest-developing markets worldwide.</p>
<p>New Content Leader in Michigan</p>
<p>Greentube’s latest foray into the US market places the firm in a position to meet content needs in Michigan, which is one of the country’s early adopters of iGaming products. As a result, Greentube’s casino games, such as Diamond Cash: Mighty Elephant, Diamond Cash: Mighty Sevens, and Diamond Cash: Oasis Riches, will be made available to US players and through licensed operators in the Great Lakes State.</p>
<p>Michigan is a particularly important market entry for Greentube, not just as a way to reaffirm its commitment to the North American region but also because of the $1.1 billion reported in annual online casino revenue for 2021. This puts Greentube in a position to access one of the busiest iGaming markets in the United States.</p>
<p>The launch is also paving the way for other important jurisdictions such as Pennsylvania and Connecticut, which both have iGaming options available, but suffer from content shortage due to the lengthy regulatory process.</p>
<p>More Growth Opportunities in the US</p>
<p>With market access deals in Michigan and New Jersey, the company is prepared to take on the United States and satisfy the demand for quality iGaming solutions. Commenting on the most recent launch, Greentube CFO Michael Bauer said:</p>
<p>“The US market is one with huge potential and one that we will greatly focus on to position ourselves as a leading provider of online casino content that will appeal to local players. We look forward to partnering with operators in Michigan and introducing our first-class content portfolio to a new audience.” Greentube CFO Michael Bauer</p>
<p>Bauer confirmed that the expansion move in Michigan is an important step in the company’s further ambitions for the North American market. In January, the company teamed up with Rush Street Interactive to introduce its content on PlaySugarHouse in New Jersey. The company pursued a course to further strengthen its exposure in the market through a partnership with GAN.</p>
