<p>DraftKings, the number one rated sports betting app that has paid out more than $7 billion to date, has signed a partnership deal with Norwich City, an English Premier League soccer club. DraftKings will thus become the official daily fantasy sports partner of the club until May 22, the last official day of the 2021/22 Premier League season. The popular daily fantasy sports website that enables sports fans to compete against each other signed a similar deal with Football League Championship’s West Bromwich Albion for the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>DraftKings Selected Norwich City to Help Them Grow in the UK</p>
<p>Continuing its excellent selection of top partners during the 2021/22 season, Norwich City decided to add DraftKings to its impressive roster. According to a statement made by the club’s commercial director Sam Jeffery, Norwich recognizes DraftKings’ success as a brand in the US, while further expressing its delight that the global online sports betting provider has chosen their club to assist their efforts to grow in the UK.</p>
<p>At the same time, DraftKings’s senior vice president for international strategy Jeffrey Haas acknowledged the merits of Chris Hart, the company’s manager for senior market development, and the contribution of sales enablement director Ryan Bahia in making the partnership turn into reality. Haas also added that DraftKings is looking forward to the collaboration with the “great club” of Norwich City.</p>
<p>Similarly, Football League Championship’s West Bromwich Albion chose DraftKings as one of its fantasy partners for the rest of the soccer season. The club’s chief commercial officer Simon King also referred to the inked partnership with DraftKings as an important achievement in a constantly evolving market and becoming more active. King also recognized DraftKings’ “significant growth” in the last few years as a sign of their top-tier products, while looking forward to reaping the benefits of their deal.</p>
<p>What Sports Fans Can Expect From the New Partnership</p>
<p>Norwich is determined to fully harness DraftKings’ leading strategies to create innovative and enhanced viewer experiences for the club’s fans. The DraftKings DFS platform currently enables players to compete against one another based on the performances of players across 15 different categories of sports, Premier League, NBA, and Champions League included. According to a YouGov poll published last December, DraftKings is the most visible sportsbook brand in the US.</p>
<p>As part of the partnership, the DFS platform will provide passionate Norwich fans and sports betting aficionados alike with the chance to draft the lineups for the rest of the 2021/22 season. At the same time, they will also actively get involved in daily contests with rewarding prize pools. This will give them the chance to further prove their unaltered support and pride for the English Premier Club Norwich and its players.</p>
<p>DraftKing’s content will be regularly displayed and recognized throughout the soccer club’s stadium, social media pages, and website.</p>
