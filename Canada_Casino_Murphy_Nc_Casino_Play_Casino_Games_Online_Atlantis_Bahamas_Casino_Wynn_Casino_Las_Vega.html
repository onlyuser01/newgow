<p>The 2021 season in the National Football League (NFL) has not begun yet but one franchise, The Chicago Bears, already scored a major coup.</p>
<p>Local Sportsbook and Casino Support</p>
<p>The Bears announced today a multi-year exclusive partnership deal with Chicago-based gaming operator Rush Street Interactive (RSI) under which the online sports betting brand of RSI, BetRivers, becomes Official Sportsbook Partner of the franchise, while the land-based casino run by RSI, Rivers Casino in Chicago, becomes the Bears’ Official Casino Partner.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly excited to announce BetRivers and Rivers Casino as our first multi-year exclusive partner in the Sportsbook and Casino categories. We look forward to connecting with our fans in fun and unique ways through these avenues and couldn’t be prouder to be building this relationship with a hometown company.” Ted Phillips, President and CEO, The Chicago Bears</p>
<p>The long-term agreement which marks the first exclusive deal for the Bears in the sportsbook and casino categories will give BetRivers and Rivers Casino brand exposure via in-stadium signage, digital and social media channels, as well as print assets.</p>
<p>“As a lifelong Bears fan, I am thrilled to have BetRivers and Rivers Casino partner with our hometown NFL team, the Chicago Bears, as the organization’s only Official Sportsbook and Casino Partner.” Neil Bluhm, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, RSI</p>
<p>Also as part of the deal, BetRivers will become the Title Partner of the customized Free To Play Game available on the Chicago Bears Official App, while BetRivers’ players will have the opportunity to see promotional campaigns developed in collaboration with the franchise that will award them with exclusive Chicago Bears prizes and experiences.</p>
<p>“We look forward to expanding our relationship with the Bears and their dedicated fan base, and offering innovative products and promotions as we remain committed to delivering a first-rate customer experience. This partnership also reinforces our commitment to hometown teams in states where we have our online and land-based sportsbooks.” Neil Bluhm, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, RSI</p>
<p>The agreement between the Bears and BetRivers comes less than a year after the NFL franchise signed a deal to designate another sportsbook operator, Australian-based PointsBet, as the club’s first sports betting sponsor. The agreement with PointsBet came shortly after the operator launched operations in Illinois last year.</p>
<p>Among other initiatives with sports franchise partners that BetRivers launched recently was the opening of the BetRivers Lounge at the PPG Paints Arena, home to the Pittsburg Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL), as part of a partnership deal signed with the professional team in September last year.</p>
<p>Also in April this year, BetRivers reached an agreement for a corporate partnership with Indy Eleven, a soccer franchise from Indiana participating in the United Soccer League (UCL), to become its official sports betting partner.</p>
