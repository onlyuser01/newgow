    <h1>Monaco Casino Hollywood Casino Grantville Pa Treasure Valley Casino Casino Winner Casino In Springfi</h1>

<p>With his knowledge in casino management, development, and investment, the new gambling startup will focus on both digital and physical casino verticals</p>
<p>After announcing he would resign from his position as chief executive officer at Rush Street Interactive in January 2022, casino industry veteran Greg Carlin has announced a fresh project up his sleeve. The new casino startup is called G2 Gaming, LLC and will rely on Carlin’s two and a half decades of experience in the field to pursue “endless opportunity across the gaming spectrum”.</p>
<p>G2 Gaming – 150+ Years of Combined Experience in the Industry</p>
<p>Created with the help of a skilled and knowledgeable team of casino industry veterans, the new casino startup will summon more than 150 combined years of online and brick-and-mortar casino expertise. G2 Gaming will focus on both land-based and digital verticals in the casino world. Carlin, who will take on the position of chief executive officer, will use his knowledge in casino management, development, and investment to see the next-generation casino company succeed.</p>
<p>The startup aims to bring “the latest technologies and experiences to the land-based and iGaming casino environments”, while on a clear mission to create state-of-the-art customer engagement experiences. This will be achieved by connecting online technology with top brick-and-mortar technology and delivering “innovative and memorable patron experiences”.</p>
<p>An “Exciting Time” for the Industry</p>
<p>G2 Gaming’s new CEO called it an “exciting time” for the industry to keep evolving, describing the entrepreneurial spirit as “alive and well”. He also mentioned the emerging jurisdictions that reunite online and the recalibration of currently existing gaming markets in an attempt to keep up with the ongoing changes. Carlin explained that all these changes are endless types of opportunities in the online and physical casino industry.</p>
<p>From his position as CEO for Rush Street Gaming, Carlin was busy supervising the growth of several land casino projects for mixed-use located in Canada and the US. The list includes four Rivers Casino venues in Schenectady, New York, Des Plaines, Illinois, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia, Philadelphia. Each of these properties which exceeded a total of $3 billion in investments turned into market leaders in their locations while being voted as top workplaces by team members. Carlin also co-founded Rush Street Interactive (RSI) and filled in the CEO position for the company created in 2012. RSI went public eight years later, turning into a top online casino and sports betting company in the US and Latin America. In August 2021, Carlin, together with two other RSI executives, Neil Bluhm and Richard Schwartz, received the Entrepreneur of the Year 2021 Midwest Award.</p>
