    <h1>Live Blackjack Casino Soboba Casino Mardi Gras Hotel Casino Circus Circus Hotel Casino In Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Thank you very much for fast reponse. With your informations i feel much more hopeful. But as i said problem is that they probably perma blocked me on chat since rude support just told me that it is a done thing and i never get any reply on emails i have sent even when i send those proofs. Someone told me to contact curacao egaming comission but unluckily they replied that CuraÃ§ao eGaming has no connection with that site and therefore any references made to CuraÃ§ao eGaming as one of the Master License holders</p>
<p>are false and misleading.</p>
<p>So i am now bit stucked and donÂ´t know what to do as a next step. I can confirm that account was open with Uk ip without any modifications and was open aproximatelly 1 week before i even made the deposit. Same as i send the documents to veryfy KYC. Casino allows to play on many providers even on uk based ip so i was never ever thinking that i cant play there. The only thing was that pragmatic provider was clearly saying its not allowed from my country. So i asked support and they just said bypass with proxy. this is one of my saved transcripts i have video of first conversation about this where they told me just use proxy and you are good but cant upload it here sice there is not such option:</p>
<p>Chat on casollo.com</p>

<p>[16:12]Customer Support: Welcome to our site, if you need help simply reply to this message, we are online and ready to help.</p>
<p>[16:14]V1601914297562607: hello i got question about pragmatic games and some other i was said that i am able to play any sort of games that there are no restrictions to play. But once i made deposit i realized that pragmatic start up shows this Sorry, you cannot use our services from this country.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>[16:14]Aleksandro has joined the conversation</p>
<p>[16:14]V1601914297562607: i was advised to use proxy on support i wanted to try it becouse pragmatic games are one of my most favorite but i have no clue how to run proxy</p>
<p>[16:14]V1601914297562607: is there any chance that somone would help me bit more</p>
<p>[16:16]V1601914297562607: i think i could do manual proxy but i have no idea what sort of IP etc i shoul put in settings</p>
<p>[16:18]Aleksandro: You can read everything on google. I can't explain this to you here, and neither am I allowed to.</p>
<p>[16:20]V1601914297562607: but doest it work as vpn? i was asking if its legal since it clearly say its restricted but if it was advice from your support so i hope if i would do that there will be later nothing like fortifying my winning that i used proxy or something just like that</p>
<p>[16:20]V1601914297562607: all i would need to know what country i should use for that proxy</p>
<p>[16:21]Aleksandro: I can't explain this to you here, and neither am I allowed to. To withdraw is not a problem because you have to verify your account. No matter which country.</p>
<p>[16:22]Aleksandro: This is just an IP number. You have to send your personal date later by email.[16:22]V1601914297562607: ye i understand i was more likely afraid that it would somehow breaking your policies that i played game that i wasnt allowed to play from my country[</p>
<p>16:23]Aleksandro: Everyone uses vpn</p>
<p>[16:23]V1601914297562607: if you are ok with that i will try out then...Its weird anyway since pragmatic is on other websites normaly open for uk...</p>
<p>[16:24]Aleksandro: much fun I wish you</p>
<p>[16:24]V1601914297562607: thank you have good day</p>
<p>[16:25]Aleksandro: Thank you, too</p>
<p>[16:25]Aleksandro has left the conversation</p>
<p>So i think it is clear..But this guy on support later on when i tried ask him why he didnt stop me or something he arogantly said. He can say whatever he wants and cut me off line. If you would help me out i can promise you that i would reward you for support as well ðŸ™‚.</p>
