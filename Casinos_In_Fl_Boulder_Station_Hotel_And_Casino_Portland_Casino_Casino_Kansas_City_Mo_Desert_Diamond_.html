    <h1>Casinos In Fl Boulder Station Hotel And Casino Portland Casino Casino Kansas City Mo Desert Diamond</h1>

<p>Dear Osman und Gülcan,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://luckydays.com/fi/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>„LuckyDays does not accept third party payments. You should only make deposits from a bank account, VISA / Mastercard cards, payment methods such as Skrill / NETELLER, or other payment methods registered in your name. LuckyDays is also not responsible for losses deposited in third party accounts."</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-players:</p>
<p>"Payments</p>
<p>For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing funds from a joint card. If you’re not able to prove that you are a legitimate owner of the payment method, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Lastly, do I understand correctly that more than one account has been created from the same IP address to activate a promotional offer? Please check the following rule:</p>
<p>"The bonus is only valid once per account / household / IP address. Unless otherwise stated, you must deposit at least € 20 / $ or the equivalent in another currency and play € 20 / $ or the equivalent in another currency to receive the deposit bonus."</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
