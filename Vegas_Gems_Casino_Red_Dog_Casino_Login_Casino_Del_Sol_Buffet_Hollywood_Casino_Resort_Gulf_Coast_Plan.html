<p>Throne of Gold review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Throne of Gold paints a picture of a kingdom torn in half by two houses. One represented by a falcon and possessed of magic, one by a hart with a powerful military. Both houses want to get their hands on the Dragon Throne in a land beset by real dragons.</p>
<p>In other words, it is a somewhat generic, post-Game of Thrones high fantasy setting.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Win in the Throne of Gold slot</p>
<p>That said, it is well detailed world with a lot of character and backstory crammed into its limited space. The symbols are all highly detailed and feel representative of a rich backstory which makes for a pleasingly immersive atmosphere.</p>
<p>The music also feels dramatic and cinematic, adding to that sense of being part of a wider narrative.</p>
<p>The animations are clean and dramatic, with the right balance of clarity and scale.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The game plays out on a five reel slot with three rows and twenty win lines. You can play any number of these lines, allowing you some control over the volatility of your game.</p>
<p>There are no gamble features or minigames, and the bonus is just a free spin round, but the win lines allow for wins in both directions. This is a little underwhelming in a slot that looks so slick on the surface. Throne of Gold is somewhat average in this regard.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Throne of Gold’s Wild symbol substitutes for all other symbols except the Scatter. It also always covers two symbols’ worth of space vertically.</p>
<p>The Wild also pays out as a regular symbol if you get three or more in a row on a winline.</p>
<p>Explanation of Scatter symbol and free spins</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol, as well as paying out for three or more anywhere on the reels, will also trigger a free spin bonus. Three Scatters get you seven free spins, four get you fourteen free spins, and five Scatters gets you twenty free spins.</p>
<p>During the free spins, all payouts are doubled.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.00%, while not impressive it is comfortably in the middle of our average zone so the game doesn’t lose any marks for this.</p>
<p>On the site we tested you can choose the number of lines you want to play. As a result you can set the range of bets anywhere from from $/£/€0.01 (if playing one line) to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 if playing all twenty.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which is too low for us to recommend matching the game with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Paytable for Throne of Gold's Wild symbol</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Throne of Gold is a well made fantasy slot machine with a well realised world and art style. However, more time could have been put into features instead of world building. On the whole, the gameplay is a little average as is the return to player.</p>
<p>The game fails to make up for these downsides with its medium volatility and bland bonus features.</p>
