    <h1>Palms Casino And Resort Sands Casino Resort The Orleans Hotel Casino Casino Extreme No Deposit Bonus</h1>

<p>The man was coming home from a Los Angeles county casino when he was attacked by two individuals who attempted to rob him</p>
<p>Lottery winners and gamblers who take home hefty jackpots are often targeted by robbers. While in the casino, gamblers are protected thanks to CCTV, in-person security and in some cases even metal detection. Yet, when outside, gamblers can become victims of robbery and this is precisely the case of one man from Irvine, California.</p>
<p>As the person was heading home after visiting a Los Angeles County casino, he was attacked by two individuals who attempted to rob him, a report released by the Irvine Police Department reveals. The incident dates back to last week. Law enforcement did not disclose the name of the victim nor at which casino he was coming home from.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, the person was approached by two individuals who attempted to rob him. The police report doesn’t disclose whether the person was harmed. There’s also no information about how the individual was able to escape the robbery attempt of the two attackers.</p>
<p>“Last night, two men attempted to rob a man returning home from a Los Angeles County Casino,“ reads a statement released by the Irvine Police Department</p>
<p>Two Suspects with Replica Firearms Were Apprehended by Police</p>
<p>While investigating the robbery attempt, law enforcement uncovered that two men who matched the description of the robbery suspects were apprehended in Compton. According to the Irvine Police Department, the two men had replica firearms in their possession and committed robberies of commercial buildings across Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>Additionally, the police said that the aforementioned crimes were committed after the robbery attempt in Irvine. Highlighting that there is no danger to the community, the Irvine Police Department confirmed that the investigation into the robbery attempt continues.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in Las Vegas, a deadly shootout has taken the lives of two people. Two other people were wounded, one fighting for his life and the other with non-life-threatening injuries. The deadly incident occurred near Strat Hotel, Casino &amp; SkyPod, according to media reports last week. The men were involved in an argument which escalated to a shootout that ultimately took the lives of two.</p>
