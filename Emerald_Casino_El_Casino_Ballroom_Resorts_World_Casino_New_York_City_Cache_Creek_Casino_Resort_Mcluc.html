    <h1>Emerald Casino El Casino Ballroom Resorts World Casino New York City Cache Creek Casino Resort Mcluc</h1>

<p>After using some free spins I win some money. Used it to play through the money and wanted to cash out. Slotastisc refused, because I used more then one coupon for free spins and that was not allowed? They denied the pay-out AND they voided the money. I'm really upset after what happened and I do believe that this is not the way to treat your customers. I'm getting the feeling that Slotastic is preventing themselves from paying out money this way. That does feel sketchy and it doesn't feel good, to be honest.</p>
<ol>
<li>Slotastic is offering these coupons pro-actively to their customers</li>
</ol>
<p>I receive weekly emails from Slotastic with offers, one of these offers are sometimes a 'free spin' bonus. Whilst your casino is mailing me and offer me these free spins I gladly accepted them, not knowing that in your terms and conditions is stated that you aren't allowed to use more then one of them. If this is in your terms and conditions, why are you pro-actively reaching out to customers to use these coupons? Also to customers who already claimed one or more coupons? That is something I really don't understand.</p>
<ol>
<li>Slotastic has absolutely no warning, error or blocking system to prevent users from using two or more coupons</li>
</ol>
<p>When you use these coupons, most of the time they are already in loaded in your account. You don't have to type them in anymore, you just click on the coupon on offer. This makes it very easy to use and gives customers absolutely NOT the feeling that they are doing something that isn't allowed. There is absolutely no sign or warning at that moment that you can't use more then one, or that you are not allowed to use more then one. Also Slotastic can choose to program their coupon system to prevent customers from using a new one, just by not accepting a new coupon when a customer wants to use a second one. None of this happened. So how should I knew as a customer that I was doing something wrong?</p>
<ol>
<li>Slotastic has other errors and warning messages in their system that DO work</li>
</ol>
<p>When I made some money out of my spins I wanted to pay out this sum of money. But I wasn't able whilst I did not reach the playthrough. This was well communicated on the website, with an error message, but also some sort of a ticker that let's you see how many playthrough you have to play before cashing out. When I finally reached this, I wanted to pay-out, but got an error because my ID and proof of adress had to be checked. I uploaded all the documents and was accepted. These warnings and offers do work as you see. Why is there no warning system for using two or more coupons? And why did nobody from Slotastisc reached out to me when I tried to pay out, wasn't able to because my documents had to be checked and prevented me from this happening? Why are you able to build in other errors, pop-ups and communication and do you choose do not do this for using more then two coupons?</p>
<ol>
<li>Slotastic offers nothing to customers to check if they break the rules</li>
</ol>
<p>I asked one of the co-workers: how can I check as a customer if I broke any rules before I ask for a pay-out? Her answer was: the user is responsible for that and there is no option to check this. How can you held customers responsible for this if there are no error messages or blocking coupons in place and there is no way to check this before asking for a pay-out? It makes absolutely no sense at all.</p>
<ol>
<li>Slotastic uses a non-acceptable and unproportional decision after this happened during pay-out</li>
</ol>
<p>What I really don't get is, with everything mentioned above, customers are pro-actively encouraged to use coupons, whilst you are e-mailing them directly and loading them pro-actively in their accounts, customers do get error messages and warning messages in other stages of using the casino, perhaps for using two or more coupons and are NOT (I repeat) are NOT in the circumstances to check if they broke any rules. Considering that: voiding my winnings (almost 70 dollars) is not acceptable, unproportional and the most outreagous thing to do.</p>
<p>My conclusion to all of this is:</p>
<p>I do believe I did nothing wrong. I just used the coupons Slotastic pro-actively offered me. There was no option to check if I broke this rule. Otherwhise I would have made a deposit. There was nobody from Slotatic who pro-actively prevented me from doing this, even why I tried to pay-out and was uploading documents to actually request a pay-out.</p>
<p>My proposal to solve this situation is:</p>
<p>You approve the payout of 68.63 USD and I promiss you that I will use no more coupons for free spins in the future. Also I hope Slotastic learns from all of this and considers changes to their system to prevent other users from this in the future. In that way, we both take our responsibility in this case, but simply voiding my winnings is unacceptable.</p>
