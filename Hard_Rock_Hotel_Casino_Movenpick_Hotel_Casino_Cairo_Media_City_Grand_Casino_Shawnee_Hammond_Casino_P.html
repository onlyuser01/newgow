<p>Novomatic’s Mexican supplier unit has introduced a new commercial director as the company gathers momentum in the region</p>
<p>Crown Gaming México has selected Enrique Manjarrez who will be stepping into the new position. He is an important addition to the company’s team of experts, as the man is a seasoned veteran with more than 20 years of relevant experience in the industry.</p>
<p>An Industry Specialist With Excellent Track Record</p>
<p>He first started at Scientific Games back in 2006 and worked as a field service engineer and QA. He was promoted to commercial manager a year after and moved to American Gaming Systems in 2012.</p>
<p>There, he spent another two years as a marketing manager and then shifted to marketing director for Sunny Group of Companies. His most recent professional path took him to Aurify where he worked as brand director and product director from 2019-2022, and then shifted to sales and product director in Mexico in 2022-2023.</p>
<p>He is now stepping into his new role as part of Novomatic’s sprawling network of highly-localized companies and arms. Commenting on his appointment as part of Crown Gaming Mexico, Manjarrez said:</p>
<p>I am excited to be part of one of the largest gaming technology companies in the world. Novomatic is known for its quality products and innovations. Crown Gaming México commercial director Enrique Manjarrez</p>
<p>The executive offered his thanks to be able to work in his home country and as a part of a global company. Novomatic VP global sales and product management Thomas Schmalzer said that his company was similarly excited to bring someone of Manjarrez’s caliber.</p>
<p>Schmalzer said that thanks to Manjarrez, Novomatic feels confident about growing its local footprint in the country. So far, the company has been present locally for 20 years, and the executive is determined to see this continue. Manjarrez plays an important role in this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has been pushing out globally. A recent deal saw Novomatic strengthen its Asia-Pacific ties in a bid to further bolster its regional presence and expand into yet more geographies.</p>
