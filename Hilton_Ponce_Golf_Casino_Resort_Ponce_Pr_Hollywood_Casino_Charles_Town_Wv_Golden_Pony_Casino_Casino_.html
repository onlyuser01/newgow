<p>Pennsylvania is getting ready to join the New Jersey and Ontario online gambling markets and introduce two-factor authentication (2FA) as a mandatory enhanced security method. The new changes need to be implemented by all operators by December 31. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) originally informed licensed operators about the upcoming move in June, giving them enough time to start implementing the necessary changes. PGCB’s spokesperson Doug Harbach explained the way the multi-factor authentication will work.</p>
<p>2FA Engaged Once Every 14 Days</p>
<p>The multi-factor authentication will need to be engaged once every two weeks, no matter the level of activity of players. Plus, independent third parties will assess the security of these 2FA measures on a yearly basis, with reports being sent to PGCB. Gaming operators in the state will also need to encrypt players’ personal data to make sure they are properly secured. These security measures will also undergo tests four times a year.</p>
<p>Unibet, FanDuel, and other operators in the state have already started to contact their registered players and announce the changes that will be implemented by the end of the year. Even more, operators such as BetPARX have already successfully put the fresh multi-factor technology into practice on their platforms.</p>
<p>Smooth Implementation of the 2FA in New Jersey</p>
<p>The introduction of the added layer of protection which guarantees security for online accounts beyond simple usernames and passwords does not come as a response to the numerous fraud issues that have been reported by operators lately. PGCB issued the directive in the summer during the same month when New Jersey regulators first introduced the requirement for the 2FA for all forms of mobile and online gambling. Ever since, the new authentication option proved to be successful, with very few to no complaints registered by gambling customers, according to New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement. Minor difficulties were addressed by gamblers who did not own smartphones when using their authentication via email. The DGE expressed its commitment to finding alternative options for these players.</p>
<p>Gaming operators in Pennsylvania can expect that, by implementing the 2FA, they will have an easier time identifying and stopping fraud attempts. At the same time, players are also advised to continue to take the necessary steps for safe and smooth online gambling experiences hygiene, such as avoiding using the same passwords for multiple accounts. The 2FA works by sending a passcode using text messaging to players attempting to access their online accounts after filling in their login details. The passcode must be entered into their gambling app to enable full access to players’ accounts. The following authentication request will commence after 14 days. Players trying to log in using different devices will be asked to repeat the 2FA procedure.</p>
