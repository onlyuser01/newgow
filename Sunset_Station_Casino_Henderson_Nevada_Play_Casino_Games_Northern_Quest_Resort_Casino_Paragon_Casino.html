<p>The university confirmed on August 14 that Lee had left the program following charges of tampering with records in connection with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation's probe into gambling activities</p>
<p>Iowa State University‘s football program has been rocked by the departure of starting defensive lineman Isaiah Lee, who left the team amidst an ongoing gambling investigation.</p>
<p>Alleged Sports Betting Casts Shadow on Iowa State Senior Isaiah Lee’s Athletic Future</p>
<p>Isaiah Lee, a redshirt senior who played in all 12 games for Iowa State last season, was accused of participating in betting on various Iowa State sports, including football games where he even bet against his own team, the Cyclones. The allegations against Lee have placed his eligibility for future athletic competition in jeopardy, as every player implicated in this investigation could potentially face a permanent ban under NCAA gambling regulations.</p>
<p>It is alleged that Lee placed a total of 115 bets amounting to $885 using the FanDuel mobile app. These wagers included 12 bets on Iowa State football games, one of which was a money-line bet against the Cyclones during their match against Texas in 2021. Iowa State triumphed with a score of 30-7, and Lee’s contributions included one tackle.</p>
<p>The gambling scandal has cast a wide net over the Iowa State football team, with several other players also facing charges. Among those implicated is starting quarterback Hunter Dekkers, who is reportedly under investigation for placing wagers on Iowa State sporting events, including a game in which he served as a backup quarterback.</p>
<p>Iowa State’s Senior Athletics Director Addresses Eligibility Concerns</p>
<p>In response to the unfolding situation, Iowa State’s senior athletics director, Nick Joos, issued a statement indicating that the university had been aware of potential eligibility issues related to sports wagering and was actively collaborating with the NCAA to address these concerns. The university remains committed to supporting student-athletes during this challenging period and ensuring compliance with NCAA regulations.</p>
<p>Isaiah Lee’s departure marks the end of his six-year tenure with Iowa State’s football program. Over the course of his college career, he played in 38 games, making 23 starts, and contributed 55 tackles, including seven for loss, and 1.5 sacks. His departure leaves a void in the defensive line that the Cyclones will need to address as they navigate the upcoming season.</p>
<p>Lee, originally a three-star prospect, joined Iowa State in 2018, choosing the university over offers from several non-Power Five schools. His departure serves as a reminder of the far-reaching consequences that can stem from involvement in illicit gambling activities.</p>
