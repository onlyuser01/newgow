<p>U.S. Women’s soccer team beats the Netherlands</p>
<p>The team scores 26 points in 12 games</p>
<p>Calls for better pay and equal prize money continue</p>
<p>As the U.S. women’s soccer team sealed a forth title in FIFA Women’s World Cup, players and fans have called out FIFA to do more to boost the game’s women community.</p>
<p>U.S. Women Make History in Soccer</p>
<p>The U.S. women soccer club soared to a triumphant, expected and well-deserved victory in the Women’s World Cup, after playing a strong game throughout the entire competition and winning a forth world cup. With it, the team has also raised questions about gender equality and equal pay, a move supported by U.S. male soccer players.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 7, 2019, the United States faced the Netherlands in the finals at Stade de Lyon for Le Grand Finale in France. Megan Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle settled the 2-0 score in favor of the United States. The opening point was scored after Rapinoe realized penalty awarded by the referees following a foul committed by Stefanie van der Gragt.</p>

<p>Aged 34, Rapinoe is the oldest player to score in the Women’s World Cup event and with six goals under her belt, she has been a valuable addition to the national team. Rapinoe was equally awared the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball recognizing her as the top scorer and top player during this World Cup.</p>
<p>As the game was wrapping up on Sunday, fans were chanting “equal pay,” a sign of the growing public disapproval of men and women being paid grossly different wages for participating in the same competitions.</p>
<p>While Rapinoe has stolen the thunder in this historical moment from he team, Lavelle is also shaping up as a promising successor. Aged 24, the young soccer player will most likely replace her in the next event.</p>
<p>Rapinoe also made headlines by refusing to respond to a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump who tweeted that her stance was intended to “disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her &amp; the team.”.</p>
<p>President Trump has been known not to be able to differentiate when someone doesn’t like him and to misinterpret it as an affront on the nation. True to his style, he then issued another tweet in which he congratulated the team:</p>
<p>Congratulations to the U.S. Women’s Soccer Team on winning the World Cup! Great and exciting play. America is proud of you all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 7, 2019</p>
<p>Yet, he President seemed to back the women’s team in their pursuit of better remuneration, arguing “to have a look at the numbers”.</p>
<p>Equal Pay Brought Up Again by Rapinoe</p>
<p>Rapinoe’s success has not dissuaded her from pursuing equal rights between women and male players. She has requested from FIFA to do more to grow the female soccer community and expand its reach.</p>
<p>On her list of criticism she directed at the world’s governing socccer body were items such s lack of equal pay, prize money and oversights in the organization, such as scheduling CONCACAF Gold Cup and the Copa America final on the same day.</p>
<p>There has been criticism coming the way of the United States as well, with many describing the players’ attitude on the field as arrogant. The U.S. team has scored 26 points in 12 games, setting a new record far outpacing previous World Cup achievements.</p>
<p>It is evident that the team takes pleasure in their work and while mimicry of some English tea customs has been rebuked, as Rapinoe put it, “it’s something that we’ve worked so hard for.” Their acts might have appeared intentionally hurtful, but they were in fact a spur-of-the-moment mirthfulness.</p>
