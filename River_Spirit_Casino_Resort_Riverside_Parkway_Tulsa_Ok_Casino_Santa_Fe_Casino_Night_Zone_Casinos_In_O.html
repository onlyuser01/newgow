<p>This year’s edition of Safer Gambling Week, a cross-industry initiative to promote safer gambling in the United Kingdom and Ireland, took place between November 1 and November 7 and had a remarkable engagement.</p>
<p>Safer Gambling Week Scores Record Impressions</p>
<p>According to statistics, the initiative’s online campaign has seen impressive growth across all social media outlets it has a presence on, contributing to the cause of teaching people to bet responsibly. Safer Gambling Week managed to reach more people than ever and promote healthier habits and tools that mitigate gambling harm.</p>
<p>Safer Gambling Week had a strong presence on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, where it propagated informed decisions and responsible wagering. Its own social media accounts scored the remarkable 1.4 million impressions – a 75% year-on-year growth, compared to 2020s 800,000 impressions.</p>
<p>Looking at the broader impact of the initiative, Safer Gambling Week’s content managed to reach over 25 million total people, which, in turn, is a 19% year-on-year increase. In comparison, last year’s edition reached 4 million fewer people.</p>
<p>Prominent Figureheads Backed the Efforts</p>
<p>Safer Gambling Week received strong backing from various prominent political figureheads. Chris Philip and several other ministers expressed their support for the initiative.</p>
<p>Other than that, several famous names in British sports also backed Safer Gambling Week. Some of them included former England forward Michael Owen, the renowned British boxer Antony Joshua and the famous horseracing jockey Sir Anthony Peter McCoy. They all helped spread the word of the initiative and invited people to be careful with their approach to gambling.</p>
<p>The chief executive officer of Betting and Gaming Council, Michael Dugher, was delighted by the huge success of this year’s edition of Safer Gambling Week. According to him, the initiative has grown to be an established annual event that sparks a nationwide discussion on the importance of safer gambling and what tools are available to realize it.</p>
<p>Dugher is glad that the number of problem gamblers has fallen as this attests to BGC’s hard work paying off.</p>
<p>“Once again, this shows the regulated betting and gaming industry’s commitment to continuing to raise standards. But our commitment to safer gambling is not just for one week of the year. Safer gambling is our mission for every week of the year,” Dugher reminded.</p>
<p>He concluded that even though the initiative has a growing impact, BGC will “continue its efforts to raise its standards even higher.”</p>
