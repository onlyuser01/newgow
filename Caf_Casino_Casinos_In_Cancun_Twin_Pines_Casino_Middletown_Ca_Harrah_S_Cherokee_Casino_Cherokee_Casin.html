    <h1>Caf Casino Casinos In Cancun Twin Pines Casino Middletown Ca Harrah S Cherokee Casino Cherokee Casin</h1>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I registered an account with LeoMonaco in June and self excluded it without making a deposit.</p>
<p>Then, on 1st August i opened an account with 24Monaco not knowing they were the same operator because i had not played at LeoMonaco.</p>
<p>Anyway, i have deposited and spent Â£795 at Monaco.</p>
<p>I have won a few times but played the winnings because my account is disabled from withdrawing until verified.</p>
<p>After reading reports on LeoMonaco and LeonMonaco, i dont think i wouldbe anle to withdraw any future winnnings anyway.</p>
<p>If these sites are connected, then i should not have been allowed to deposit at 24Monaco and i want my deposits back.</p>
<p>The deny that they are connected and ignore my emails when i ask for their Licence details.</p>
<p>Sandra</p>
