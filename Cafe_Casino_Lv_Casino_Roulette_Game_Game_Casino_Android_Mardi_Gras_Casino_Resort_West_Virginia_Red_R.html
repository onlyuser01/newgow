    <h1>Cafe Casino Lv Casino Roulette Game Game Casino Android Mardi Gras Casino Resort West Virginia Red R</h1>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>I won 6,000 euros in the night from 02/09/2023 to 02/10/2023, on 02/10/2023 I wanted to withdraw the money.</p>
<p>I've always won smaller amounts before, and they were paid out without any problems. (Account was already verified).</p>
<p>The same day they wanted me to re-verify my account, well done, they asked for proof of residency and bank statement confirmation. Everything, no problem I've done so everything has been rejected so far. You always want something new. (It can't be that. Countless e-mails sent, now they want all deposits from 02/09/2023 again, once like this and then like that it can't be. Above all, have I already verified my account beforehand??? ?On February 17th, 2023, they only wanted the bank statement for the 200 euros from February 9th, 2023. (I went to the bank extra and had everything printed out, then I only sent the printout from February 9th, 2023 (rejected again).</p>
<p>Now you want all the deposits, today I scanned the bank statement and the water bill and converted them to PDF, that's what they wanted. Now I just wrote to the support earlier, they can't write a clear answer about what exactly is needed. The support says: "No scanned items will be accepted". How should I send it then???? When I asked the question, I got the answer I can request an extract for online format from my bank (transfer), what is the purpose of this, above all, my account is there - I think it is it's just a back and forth how come I keep going to my bank even though I've already sent a bank statement.</p>
<p>I'll try again, but it takes 4 days before I can upload it again. I beg you to help me. My nerves are really at the end. Actually I was very happy with the casino. According to the reviews, there are permanent problems with higher payouts, unfortunately I only read that later.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
