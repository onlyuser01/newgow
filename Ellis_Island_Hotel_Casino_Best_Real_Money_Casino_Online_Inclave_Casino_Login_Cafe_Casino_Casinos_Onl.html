<p>Evolution has made its commitment to the North American market very obvious over the past years, with new investments in dedicated studios and a push for more localized and tailored content. Now, the world’s leading live dealer developer continues to deliver on this by expanding the range of games players can enjoy in one of the United State’s biggest iGaming markets, Michigan.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Michigan players will have access to the company’s Live Craps online casino game at partner operators that feature it. Michigan marks the latest state in which Evolution has sought to expand after Live Craps versions were previously and successfully launched in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, two other important bastions of the iGaming experience in the United States.</p>
<p>Enjoy a strong reception, the company knew that it was time to make sure that players in Michigan also get a chance to try it out. Evolution CCO of North America Jeff Millar welcomed this opportunity and said:</p>
<p>"We are so proud that this game was the very first online Live Craps game in the industry. In every state so far, its launch is seen as a true landmark moment because Craps is such an iconic game with a long and colorful history in the US."</p>
<p>He hailed the qualities of the product, speaking about the undeniable speakeasy-era charm that the game has about it. The game is not just a run-of-the-mill reimagination of the original. It’s designed and introduced to players in a fashion that makes it easy to grasp and follow.</p>
<p>Craps is traditionally a more challenging game for most players, and this is why the company has worked hard to make sure that it’s approachable in terms of design and gameplay. There is even a simplified "Easy Mode" gameplay option that really seeks to make the experience one that players in the United States can remember and enjoy fondly.</p>
<p>Live Craps was launched in the United States by Evolution in August last year, becoming a strong success story from the very beginning. The game has been enjoying a steady uptake in interest, enough, Evolution believes, to make sure the provider implements it within the ecosystem of more iGaming states.</p>
<p>As the United States hurries to add more regulated markets, Evolution will to be looking at where to expand its Live Casino product next – Live Craps included.</p>
