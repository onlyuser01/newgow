<p>A terrible car accident near the center of Las Vegas has seen two pedestrians die on a busy crossing where people usually move between casinos</p>
<p>Associated Press reported that on December 28, a man and a woman from New Mexico, William Clayton Baxter Jr, age 44, and Kristie Eileen Baxter, age 51, were hit by an SUV at a busy pedestrian crossing in the vicinity of Fremont Street Experience casino mall.</p>
<p>Both Pedestrians Died from Their Injuries caused by the Car Accident</p>
<p>Las Vegas authorities reported that the man and woman were crossing during a “Don’t walk” signal when they were hit by an SUV driven by Mykael Lanice-Lynn Terrell, age 28. The accident happened at Fremont and 4th streets.</p>
<p>William Clayton Baxter Jr died at the spot immediately after the crash, while Kristie Eileen Baxter was taken to the hospital where she eventually died from her wounds. A Clark County investigator reported that the deaths were deemed an accident as the two people passed away as a result of their blunt force injuries caused by the crash. Currently, the police have no information on whether the two people were related in any way.</p>
<p>This pedestrian crossing near The Fermont Street Experience is usually quite busy as there are a lot of stores, casinos, bars, and restaurants in the area. It is a walkway controlled by traffic lights. The street goes only one way but it has three lanes. Above it, there is a zip-line attraction, which also contributes to the area being crowded and, on the side, there is a long video canopy. Further congestion is caused by the many street performers that do their shows in the area.</p>
<p>SUV Driver Hits Pedestrians and Runs</p>
<p>After the crash, the 28-year-old driver of the SUV, Mykael Lanice-Lynn Terrell, left the scene in a hurry. However, the police force quickly caught up with her and arrested her on charges of driving while under the influence of alcohol or other substances, reckless driving, and leaving the scene of the accident.</p>
<p>After being jailed, Terrell had to appear before a judge on December 29. The judge determined a bail of $100,000 and set the court hearing for January 4. In case Terrell is able to pay the large bail, she will be obliged to wear a tracking monitor, which is installed in an ankle bracelet. Terrell will also be forbidden to drive until the court pronounces its final sentence.</p>
<p>Terrell, who works at an internet company as an account executive, is a mother of a three-year-old child whom she raises alone. She has lived in Las Vegas for over three years.</p>
<p>Marissa Pensabene has been appointed as Terrell’s public defender in the case. The single mother faces a jail sentence of two to 20 years for each of the deaths in the accident. Her defender declined to make any comments outside the court.</p>
