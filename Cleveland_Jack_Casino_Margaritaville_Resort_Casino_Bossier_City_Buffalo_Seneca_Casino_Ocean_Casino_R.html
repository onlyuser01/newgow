<p>BF Games has made another expansion move in Romania after the company announced today that it will be going live with Superbet.ro, a local iGaming and sports betting operator. As a result, BF Games’ top-performing slots and games will now be available to customers in Romania and specifically those that play at Superbet.</p>
<p>Superbet Welcomes Games from BF Games in Romania</p>
<p>The studio is working on some of its all-time favorite games, including Royal Crown, Burning Slots, Book of God, Lucky Symbols, and Stunning Hot Remastered, to name a few of the possibilities. BF Games is also excited about its roadmap down the road as it plans to add new games to what is the largest operator in the Romanian market.</p>
<p>BF Games head of business development Claudia Melcaru welcomed the opportunity and said that the company was excited to roll out with Superbet in Romania, as it’s another opportunity to showcase the supplier’s titles. Melcaru added:</p>
<p>Our portfolio has proven successful in Romania, and we have great knowledge of the player preferences in the region which ensures we can offer Superbet’s local players maximum excitement and entertainment. BF Games head of business development Claudia Melcaru</p>
<p>Superbet will also gain access to those future games by BF Games as they become available. The partnership finds its roots in Croatia where Superbet and BF Games already have an active partnership in place. BF Games for its part hopes to considerably scale up its offer and expand across Europe, with its plans including new jurisdictions and building upon its strong relationship with already existing partners.</p>
<p>Great Content for the Entire Continent</p>
<p>Superbet and BF Games are likely to continue steering their partnership to new markets as such become available. BF Games for its part has had many reasons to be confident about its future as a supplier of gaming products in Europe.</p>
<p>The company is licensed by the UK Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority. It also holds the relevant licensing permits from the Romanian gambling regulator Oficiul National pentru Jocuri de Noroc.</p>
<p>Many of the company’s latest releases include excellent games such as Stunning Cash, Burning Slots 40, Buffalo Trail Lite, Cave of Gold, Burning Slots 20, Chicken Madness, and more. BF Games has more games down the road planned for it.</p>
