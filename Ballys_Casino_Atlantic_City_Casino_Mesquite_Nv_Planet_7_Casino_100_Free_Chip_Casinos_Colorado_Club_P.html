    <h1>Ballys Casino Atlantic City Casino Mesquite Nv Planet 7 Casino 100 Free Chip Casinos Colorado Club P</h1>

<p>Hi I’m writing to make you aware of the casino site dingo-casino.com.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with a similar Australian based dingo site.</p>
<p>The site I’m talking about dingo-casino.com is a non gamstop site that DOES accept players from the United Kingdom and is fully open.</p>
<p>Basically I’m making it my mission to make sure the internet knows how bad this casino is - I deposit 3 separate amounts of money last week Wednesday 6th July totalling £600.</p>
<p>Got up to 1000 euro on European roulette and requested the withdrawal. After being fully verified I was told 3-5 days to process my withdrawal.</p>
<p>Then I was told it will probably be another 3-5 days for it to get to my bank.</p>
<p>Bank transfer method.</p>
<p>So they took it right up to the 5th business day only to then send me an email saying they have taken my winnings off me because I didn’t follow the terms and conditions. I played with no bonus - I won fair and square on European roulette!</p>
<p>I relied on this money. So shocked and devastated and depressed that they took it off me. SCAM SITE. I chatted every day on live chat and email and they fooled me into thinking everything was fine!</p>
<p>Not only have I lost my £600 I deposited but then I lost my fair 1000 winnings.</p>
<p>The fact I never had a real answer about how long it was taking just "3-5 days"</p>
<p>Then they hang it out until the 5th day then simply take the money off my balance is a disgrace!</p>
<p>There is so much small print on real play money that it is almost worst than playing with a bonus!</p>
<p>I think they must wait till day 5 then if you have not reversed the super slow withdrawal yourself then they will find a breach and take it off you anyway!</p>
<p>I have attached a few pics for you:</p>
