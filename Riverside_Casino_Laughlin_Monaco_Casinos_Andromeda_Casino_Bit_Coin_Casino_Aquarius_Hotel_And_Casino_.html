<p>Battle Zeus to Gain Ultimate Supremacy with Free Spins</p>
<p>When commenting on the new releases, the company’s director of casino products, Shelley Hannah, expressed their trust in the slot’s ability to “keep players captivated” while striving to battle Zeus, overcome the almighty Ancient Greek god, and have their names etched amongst the iconic legends of Olympus.</p>
<p>Hannah also praised the excellent game features designed to keep players fully engaged while exploring the ancient realm as envisioned by the studio, adding the slot has “all the tools that it takes” to turn into another hit with their player base.</p>
<p>The slot’s backdrop displays the popular and imposing Ancient Greek columned structures, the crawling ivy and tall mountain imagery, and the gates of Olympus itself opening wide for players who will fully explore the special mechanics during the bonus round.</p>
<p>To scoop up a cash prize of up to 2,000x the bet, players must land lightning strike symbols on the second, third, and fourth reels. A minimum of three of these symbols are necessary for the cash prize to be obtained.</p>
<p>Three scatter symbols popping up on mid-position reels will bring players 10 free spins. When scatter symbols land on the second and fourth reels, players get 10 super free spins. There is also a super bonus scatter symbol that can be revealed on the third reel.</p>
<p>Collection Feature and Bonus Buy Options</p>
<p>To engage the collection feature, players must see a lightning strike symbol land on any position on the reels. This will instantly increase the collection meter by one unit. Once a stage of the collection meter is fully completed, players receive free spins.</p>
<p>It is also possible to purchase any of these free spins bonus rounds by paying 40x the bet for free spins and 80x the stake for the super free spins.</p>
<p>In September 2022, the company launched its promotional suite, Relax Rush, in an effort to introduce high-quality promotional tools to Relax-driven networks and operators.</p>
<p>The launch featured a €1 million campaign that was closely tied to the five-tiered progressive Dream Drop Jackpots product launched in May. The latter is set to take the slot gameplay world by storm by providing players with the biggest must-hit jackpot in history.</p>
<p>Last December, the studio announced its fifth Dream Drop jackpot winner in the person of a Dutch player who used the Kansino brand in the Netherlands to scoop up the €1,886,174.63 ($1.990.951,63) prize.</p>
<p>Last month, Relax Gaming released Joker Split with a max win of 20,000x and free spins.</p>
