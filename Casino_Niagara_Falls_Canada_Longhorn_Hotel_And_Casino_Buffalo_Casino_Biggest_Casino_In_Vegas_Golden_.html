<p>Affinity Interactive’s Daily Racing Form (DRF) is now available in Iowa as an online sportsbook. The platform, which specializes in providing premium data and in-depth editorial coverage on horse racing for fans across North America, is forging ahead with a new foray in the quickly-developing sports betting space.</p>
<p>DRF Gets Serious About Sports Betting</p>
<p>The sportsbook is powered by the proprietary DRF Bets solution, which has been expanding rapidly across the United States, and beyond. Available in Iowa, the platform offers coverage on US and international sports, along with numerous market types to name moneyline, totals, parlays, in-play selections, and point spreads.</p>
<p>The DRF Sportsbook is part of a concentrated effort by Daily Racing Form to pull ahead and ensure a prominent spot in the fast-evolving landscape for interactive wagering in North America.</p>
<p>The company launched the DRF Sports website in September 2021 and introduced a DRF Cash Grab F2P prediction game in October, following in an established formula for securing better player engagement. Affinity Interactive’s chief digital officer, Itay Fisher, welcomed the opportunity to launch this venture and commented on its significance:</p>
<p>“The launch of our first sportsbook is a significant event for Affinity Interactive and DRF as we continue our ambitious plans to deliver a world-class, digital sports betting product to sports fans across the US.” Affinity Interactive chief digital officer Itay Fisher</p>
<p>Affinity Interactive’s executive noted that the launch of the sportsbook is a third major sports product launch and represents the company’s ambition to be represented in the sports vertical and in various forms.</p>
<p>Numerous Launches Across the Sports Vertical</p>
<p>“This is another important step as we continue to deliver on our pipeline of innovative offerings that will position us to grow our presence nationwide and take bets in every state,” Fisher added.</p>
<p>Choosing Iowa has been the result of thorough research, confirmed Affinity Interactive chairman James Zenni. It was facilitated through the company’s existing ownership of Lakeside Casino in Osceola.</p>
<p>“As we continue to optimize and integrate our complementary land-based and interactive properties, we are highly focused on positioning our platform as the go-to sports betting destination.” Affinity Interactive chairman James Zenni</p>
<p>Affinity Interactive has been present elsewhere. Affinity’s land-based properties in Missouri have netted it a partnership with Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) earlier this week as the company seeks to gain an early market launch.</p>
<p>The DRF sportsbook is an opportunity for the company to diversify and continue competing against industry leaders, not least by bringing a quality and comprehensive sports betting experience on all levels.</p>
<p>Previously, Affinity Interactive teamed up with Kambi to help the company expand its presence in the United States.</p>
