<p>Ben Wright is taking over UK Tote Group’s compliance as the company continues to pursue revitalization of its offer and expansion into new products.</p>
<p>UK Tote Group Boosts Compliance with Ben Wright Appointment</p>
<p>Ben Wright has been appointed as UK Tote Group’s new head of compliance operations. Wright, who served as a risk strategy manager at Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, is now in charge of UK Tote Group’s compliance and helps the company spearhead its regulatory policy.</p>
<p>During Wright’s stint with Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, he worked as a due diligence manager and was in charge of operational processes as well as dealing with customer complaints. He was later promoted to a more managerial position and in charge of running a 30-member team.</p>
<p>Today, Wright is taking this experience and bringing it to the UK Tote Group, where he will seek to ensure that the company that has entrusted him with compliance meets both domestic and international regulatory standards.</p>
<p>In a quick LinkedIn post announcing his appointment, Wright expressed his appreciation to be joining what he described as a “well-loved and historic institution.” He started his first day at Tote Group on Monday.</p>
<p>Changing Model for UK Tote Group</p>
<p>UK Tote Group Dani Johnson responded by adding that the group has strengthened its compliance and operations and that Wright now brings excellent experience and expertise as head of compliance. This comes at a time when the UK Tote Group is considering shifting from a pari-mutuel betting model to a more traditional variety of betting markets.</p>
<p>The company previously secured a £20 million investment from existing shareholders to expedite the adoption of new technology and products that go beyond its traditional bastion of horse racing fixtures and gambling markets.</p>
<p>Moving forward, UK Tote Group will seek to diversify its offer, adding more traditional sports and building an offering that is fit to cater to the tastes of mainstream sports fans.</p>
