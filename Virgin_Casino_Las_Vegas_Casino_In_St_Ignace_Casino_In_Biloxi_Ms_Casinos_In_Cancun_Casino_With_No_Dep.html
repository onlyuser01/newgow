<p>Greentube, a prominent supplier and NOVOMATIC’s dedicated Interactive division, has secured a new important milestone in the United States. Moving forward, the company will be eligible to provide its online casino games to partner operators in Pennsylvania, following a successful completion of the licensure procedure with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>The company has been accredited and now operates with an Interactive Gaming Manufacturer License which allows it to bring its acclaimed and player-favorite games to the Keystone State, which is the third largest market when it comes to iGaming revenue. No specific operators have been named just yet, but deals with local partners should be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Greentube is bringing many established and favorite games, such as Diamond Cash and Thunder Cash, Money Maker, and more. All of these games are bound to strike home with local players in Pennsylvania, as they have with other states in the country.</p>
<p>Greentube began with its expansion in the United States in January 2022 and has been unlocking access to new markets ever since. The company has been able to secure access to markets in NewJersey, Connecticut, and Michigan, and it is determined to continue growing its regional footprint at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>Greentube CFO and CGO Michael Bauer hailed the importance of this milestone and what it meant for the supplier’s further ambitions for the US and North American markets. "We are looking forward to working alongside operators within the state to serve players with our unique brand of entertaining content," Bauer said.</p>
<p>The license in Connecticut was acquired in February with the company making its ambitions for the broader iGaming market in the United States known. As to the company’s regional footprint, Greentube has sought to not just acquire new licenses, but also continue to grow its regional partnership through direct integrations with partner brands.</p>
<p>This is why in April the company strengthened its presence in Michigan and Ontario through a content alliance with Rush Street Interactive and the company’s BetRivers brand. Greentube has similarly pursued other regional expansion moves beyond North America. The company recently teamed up with NetBet in Italy and with 777.es in Spain, as the supplier continues to grow its footprint in some of the most lucrative and best-regulated markets in Europe, and the world.</p>
