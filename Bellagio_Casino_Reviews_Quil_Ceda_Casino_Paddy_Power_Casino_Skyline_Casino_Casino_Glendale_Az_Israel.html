<p>Israel Adesanya is defending his UFC Middleweight title this weekend at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney, Australia, against Sean Strickland in the main event of UFC 293.</p>
<p>Israel Adesanya (24-2) is a huge favorite to win in Sydney against Sean Strickland (27-5), who’s fighting for a UFC title for the first time in his career. Although Strickland is famous for being as tough as they come, Adesanya’s kickboxing prowess just looks too for him. But maybe “Tarzan” has prepared something that will surprise “The Last Stylebender?”</p>

<p>Reasons Why Israel Adesanya Is a Huge Favorite</p>
<p>Israel Adesanya has lost only two fights in his professional MMA career. His first loss happened on his UFC Light Heavyweight debut when he lost to Jan Blachowicz by decision. It was a title fight, fought in early 2021, but he failed to win it and become a double champ.</p>
<p>Izzy gave up on that dream and went on to defend his UFC Middleweight against Marvin Vettori, Robert Whittaker, and Jared Cannonier, before finally losing it to Alex Pereira in late 2022. It was a TKO loss in the fifth round, which was the first time Adesanya got finished in MMA.</p>
<p>He got his revenge in April 2023, when we saw him KO Pereira in round 2. Now, he’s defending his UFC Middleweight title for the first time in his second stint as the 185lb champ.</p>
<p>Can Sean Strickland Stage a Surprise?</p>
<p>Sean Strickland a.k.a. “Tarzan” is 27-5 overall with two losses by KO/TKO and three by decision. The last time he got knocked out was in summer 2022 against Alex Pereira in round 1. After that loss, another one followed – Jared Cannonier beat him by a split decision in a five-round bout.</p>
<p>Strickland landed 152 significant strikes in that fight, as well as made one takedown, but still ended up losing. Then, he moved up a division and beat Nassourdine Imavov by unanimous decision. In that fight, we saw him land 182 strikes and record one TD.</p>
<p>In his most recent fight, he KO-ed Abus Magomedov, which is what earned him a shot at the title. But this time, he’s fighting a much, much tougher opponent.</p>
<p>Adesanya vs. Strickland Prediction</p>
<p>Adesanya is one of the best kickboxers in the UFC, with a pretty decent TD defense. Strickland is a jack of all trades, with his strongest weapon being his resilience. He looks like a guy who can stay in the octagon for 25 minutes against Izzy, but we honestly doubt he can win the fight. In fact, we think that oddsmakers are right to think of Adesanya as a -670 favorite.</p>
<p>Pick: Israel Adesanya to win</p>
