<p>Bayern Munich welcome Manchester City on Wednesday in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal. The Germans are hoping that with the help of their fans at Allianz Arena, they can (somehow) annul Man City’s 3-0 lead</p>
<p>don’t look great for Bayern Munich. Not only are they 3-0 down on aggregate against Manchester City, but there are also many problems in their locker room. Still, these guys are famous for never giving up, so maybe a surprise awaits us on Wednesday?</p>

<p>Problems Keep Piling on for Bayern Munich</p>
<p>A few weeks, Bayern Munich’s board of directors decided to sack Julien Nagelsmann and appoint Thomas Tuchel as the team manager. Sure, he’s got the experience needed to lead the team to glory, but he just hasn’t had much time to implement his style.</p>
<p>This is why no one should be too surprised that Bayern are 3-0 down on aggregate against Man City. What is surprising is that this team played 1-1 at home against Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bayern president Hainer on Sadio Mané: “What happened after the game cannot be tolerated. Sadio was punished. The fine – even with his salary – hurts him”, tells BILD. 🚨🔴🇸🇳</p>
<p>“He and Leroy Sané spoke out. Sadio has apologized to the team. We are now looking ahead”. pic.twitter.com/aAMSZ1NkOJ — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) April 15, 2023</p>
<p>As a result, they’re now just two points away from Borussia Dortmund in the German top flight, which is something that needs to worry them a lot. Unfortunately, they’ve got an even bigger worry – the chemistry among their players is reportedly very bad.</p>
<p>The story goes that a few days ago, Sadio Mane punched his fellow forward Leroy Sane during an argument in the locker room.</p>
<p>Manchester City Set to Control the Game</p>
<p>They got a 3-0 lead, meaning that they just need to avoid losing heavily on Wednesday and they’re going to qualify for the semifinals. Luckily for them, they’re great at managing the game. This team has an incredibly strong midfield, with players that like to keep the ball in their possession for as much as possible.</p>
<p>There’s going to be a real battle in the center of the pitch, and we think Man City are going to win it. They’re going to control the game, not letting Bayern create too many goal attempts. That said, we’re almost 100% certain Pep Guardiola’s men will advance to the next phase of the Champions League. But will they win on Wednesday?</p>
<p>Bayern Munich vs Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>We think that Bayern Munich players are aware they can’t do much in this game. They will try to win, but probably won’t go all-in. After all, they got the Bundesliga to think about. That’s why we think there won’t be too many goals on Wednesday, with a draw being the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>Pick: Bayern Munich and Manchester City to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
