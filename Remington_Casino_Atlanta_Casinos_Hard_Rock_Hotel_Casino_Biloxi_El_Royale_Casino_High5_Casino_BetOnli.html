    <h1>Remington Casino Atlanta Casinos Hard Rock Hotel Casino Biloxi El Royale Casino High5 Casino BetOnli</h1>

<p>On 11/4/2021, my account with BetOnline was closed with no apparent reason or explanation. On top of that I still have over $10,000 in funds/winnings that were mine and earned legitimately.</p>
<p>BetOnline refused to give me the money that's rightfully mine that I've won through years of use and wagering through their website. I've been a long time customer and have spent well over $50,000 with them through their casino, sportsbook and poker. But when it came time to pay up and withdrawal my money, they closed my account and kept my money with no explanation whatsoever.</p>
<p>This is not how you conduct a legitimate business. This right here is cheating and scamming. I demand to have my money that's still in my account or else refund me every penny that I've put into this establishment. They know how to take people's money but when it came to pay out they pull out this scheme of closing the account and not paying up.</p>
<p>I have every receipt and communication with them and will be contacting the proper authorities, Attorney General and whoever I need to shut them down and not have anybody else fall victim to them.</p>
<p>I know part of this is my fault for gambling and that's part of what is expected when you sign up and participate in gambling but the money that I still have in there is rightfully mine and should be distributed to me accordingly. This right here is unfair gaming protocol and should be prosecuted or looked at because it's just not right.</p>
