    <h1>Seneca Niagara Resort Casino 4Th Street Niagara Falls Ny Best Us Online Casinos Caesars Atlantic Cit</h1>

<p>Dear Rene,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. Several reasons might have been causing your inability to withdraw your winnings successfully. Firstly, maybe you didn’t complete the KYC (verification) process in the past. Secondly, if you chose a different method for withdrawing from the one that has been used for depositing:</p>
<p>T&amp;C: "The withdrawals will be remitted only to the same account from which the funds originated. There can also be limitations for withdrawals. The identity of players must first be verified."</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the self-exclusion process, the casino requires a written notice to be sent to support@campeonbet.com (please see below):</p>
<p>"The customer needs to access his/her personal Campeonbet Account and select 'My Profile' and then 'Time-Out'. With 'Time-out', the User has the option to take a short break from our services for: 1 day, 3 days, 5 days or 7 days. Once the Time-Out is selected, the customer needs to click on 'Save' to submit the request. The request will be accepted immediately, and the client will receive a confirmation via email. In case of Self-Exclusion, customer needs to send a written notice at support@campeonbet.com with the period he/she wants the Self-Exclusion to be active as well as the reasons behind that decision.</p>
<p>'Time-Out' and 'Self-Exclusion' is a formal process, where the customers, at their discretion, request to be barred for a definite or indefinite period. 'Time-Out' and 'Self-Exclusion' shall become effective immediately. During this time, we cannot accept deposits or bets. Any ongoing bets will remain active and any winnings will be paid to the customer after the event is over."</p>
<p>Please, forward to me any relevant communication between you and the casino (confirmation of successful verification process or response to your self-exclusion request). My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. I will be waiting for your reply patiently.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
