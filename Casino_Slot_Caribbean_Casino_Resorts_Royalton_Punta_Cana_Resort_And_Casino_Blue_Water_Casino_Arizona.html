    <h1>Casino Slot Caribbean Casino Resorts Royalton Punta Cana Resort And Casino Blue Water Casino Arizona</h1>

<p>This is a blatant lie. This is 100% false. I have only ever created 3 accounts there. The 1st (StoneColdBroke) is the only account I have ever played on or claimed any promotions.</p>
<p>The 2nd account I created was in order to use live support when my account was hacked some months ago. I do not recall the account name I created then because I was never planning to use it again. I only used it once to talk to live support. I claimed no promotions and I did not play on it at all. I never logged into it again after I spoke to live support. I can not provide the exact date this happened since I am currently locked out of my account, so I cannot check records, but they should have a record of it because they helped me regain access to StoneColdBroke. When I regained access to the account I saw that my funds had been stolen. I spoke with live support and told them this and they said there was nothing they could do but they would give me a one time bonus that was nowhere close to what was stolen.</p>
<p>The 3rd account (StoneColdBroke2) was the one created recently when they locked my account and once again it was only used to speak with live support. I spoke with them when it was created and then again 2 days later because I had not received the email they said I would get within 4 hours. Those are the only 2 times I logged into that account and I never played on the account nor claimed any promotions.</p>
<p>Roobet stating I created 150+ accounts and that I claimed bonuses multiple times is 1000% a blatant lie. The only bonuses I have ever received were on StoneColdBroke and those were the one time bonus when I was hacked, a handful of bonus codes received via their Twitter or from me watching a stream for 15 or 25 cents, and the Roowards I earned from my losses. None of those were claimed more than once.</p>
<p>I also have never been asked to do any type of additional verification. I would ask Roobet to show the emails they sent requesting any type of further verification because they do not exist.</p>
<p>I also was in the middle of a bonus buy when the account was locked so my balance was not at $5. And I lost $10s of thousands of dollars on their site and was due massive rewards.</p>
<p>Roobet is blatantly lying about all of this. I have never in my 43 years of life experienced any type of customer service from any business such as Roobet is providing now. They are blatantly stealing from a customer who lost lots of money to them and they are blatantly lying about why the account was locked.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that all of their promoted streamers/influencers, people they give free money to play with and keep a %, tell their viewers to create new accounts and use the streamer's referral code in order to be eligible for the streamers giveaways. I personally never did this, but why are they allowing people they sponsor to instruct customers to create new accounts if this violates their TOS?</p>
<p>Additionally, they have still yet to respond to me via email.</p>
<p>It is insulting that they're offering $5 to cover their thievery. It is obvious that Roobet does not wish to make this situation right so please let your users know that this casino is stealing from their customers and lying about the reasons they are stealing.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
