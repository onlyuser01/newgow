    <h1>Hi5 Casino Coco Casino Online Casinos Real How Many Casinos In Atlantic City Downstream Casino Conce</h1>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I deposited there 300$, I placed somebets but meanwhile stake accused me of money laudering! and requested Level 4 verification.</p>
<p>I won some bets any my balance right now is 761$. I'm just player and I never been accused of fraud like money lauder.</p>
<p>Stake KYC team requested 4/4 levels, So far I succesfully pased level 2 after few selfies and ID photos.</p>
<p>I write this because I'm struggling with lvl 3 &amp; 4.</p>
<p>They request from me proof of adress and source of funds. I uploaded few times electricity bill with payment proof but everytime something does not fit them. For lvl2 I used Driver License that has my address described but still they don't want to veryfi my adress.</p>
<p>Level 4 is big joke. First I asked how I can upload documents because after 1st rejection I was confused how can I upload 2 files at once, and from live support I was told "You may find more information on the internet on how to do so." after they suggested merge 2 PDF files. Next day after I did that and uploaded it. They rejected and reason was " documents can't be digital" - these documents were orginal PDFs merged into 1 as recommended by live support.</p>
<p>I tried dozen of times pass this verification with documents I got but after all I was told to take a break since I can't pass it...</p>
<p>Their support seems like just copy pasting formulas and keep playing on stake's time to avoid sucesfull verification.</p>
