<p>Yggdrasil launches the latest game in its portfolio – Lilith’s Inferno</p>
<p>AvatarUX Studios collaborates on the project</p>
<p>Lilith’s Inferno introduces innovative gaming features</p>
<p>Lilith’s Inferno™ is now available to Yggdrasil fans. The game has been developed with AvatarUX Studios and offers innovative graphics and gamification features.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Launches Lilith’s Inferno</p>
<p>Innovative casino game-maker Yggdrasil has launched a new game as of today, October 10. Lilith’s Inferno is developed in collaboration with AvatarUX Studios to bring players an unrivalled slot experience. The game is part of the so-called YGS Masters productions, which introduce different characters and set different plots in the casino world. Previously titles in the series include:</p>
<p>Niagara Falls</p>
<p>Nikola Tesla’s Incredible Machine</p>
<p>The game introduces players to a variety of 3D animations and features, enhancing the overall experience. Lilith’s Inferno comes with a 5×4 grid and the plot revolves around Lilith, a demon who ventures into the underworld in a bid to defeat four gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil has pivoted the entire gameplay around Lilith’s clashes with the demi-gods and the introduction of specific symbols that can push the overall winnings to 3,968x of a player’s original stake.</p>
<p>New Gamification Features</p>
<p>Lilith will be able to draw a crystal sword as well as access the Hero Bonus feature. The partnership with AvatarUX Studios has allowed the company to introduce enhanced, cutting-edge graphics.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest release, Head of Studio Partnerships for Yggdrasil, Stuart McCarthy, had this to say:</p>
<p>“Lilith’s Inferno is a dynamic and riveting addition to our YGS Masters portfolio. With its red-hot theme and incredible animation, it offers players a different experience to previous YGS releases Niagara Falls and Nikola Tesla’s Incredible Machine. From the outset of the YGS initiative we’ve always strived to give players as much choice as possible, and there is plenty more to come!”</p>
<p>AvatarUX Managing Director Marcus Honney also commented the news, saying that the company was delighted to be working with YGS Masters. He pointed out to the advanced graphics and gamification features that the Lilith’s Inferno slot brought to the iGaming table.</p>
<p>The highlight of the game is the ‘hero bonus level,’ where Lilith faces off with the guards. The game has been translated into 24 languages as of the time of release and it offers 96.4% in RTP. Yggdrasil last released a game on September 30, when the studio revealed Golden Chip Roulette, an overhaul of the classic roulette product.</p>
<p>In September, Yggdrasil teamed up with Patagonia, making first steps into Latin America where online casino games are only now beginning to gather steam.</p>
