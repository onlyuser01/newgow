<p>Super Group, the owner of sports betting brand Betway and multi-brand online casino Spin, released an update on Betway’s sponsorship and partnership deals across European soccer to emphasize the growing role and presence of the brand.</p>
<p>Summary of European Soccer Partnerships</p>
<p>Super Group, which signed a definitive merger agreement with NYSE-listed SPAC Sports Entertainment Acquisition Corp (SEAH), outlined the significant progress its sports betting brand achieved across European soccer in 2021.</p>
<p>Betway’s visibility across all of Europe’s top football leagues continues to grow, keeping the brand top-of-mind among sports and betting enthusiasts.” Neal Menashe, CEO, Super Group</p>
<p>In the English Premier League (EPL), Betway is “the most visible betting brand,” boasting various partnerships with 13 clubs, including West Ham United and Leicester City, to ensure some form of its branding features in 254 of the 380 league games.</p>
<p>In LaLiga in Spain, where recently Betway teamed with 11-time winner Atlético de Madrid to become its official sports betting partner, the brand also has a high level of visibility, featuring in 83 games per season, including all away matches of LaLiga’s trio of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico de Madrid.</p>
<p>Sports betting partnerships with VfB Stuttgart, Eintracht Frankfurt and Hertha Berlin ensure brand visibility in the German Bundesliga, while similar agreements with Werder Bremen and Schalke 04 provide Betway exposure in the second echelon of Bundesliga.</p>
<p>In Europe’s remaining top-four soccer league, Italian Serie A, Betway gained exposure across 45 fixtures during the season after the league implemented digital billboard replacement technology.</p>
<p>“The progress we are making to ingrain the Betway brand as a constant fixture at marquee events across the world’s most popular sports is core to our growth strategy.” Neal Menashe, CEO, Super Group</p>
<p>Outside of Europe’s top 4 leagues, Betway recently renewed its sponsorship deal with the knockout competition in Belgium, the Croky Cup, to complete a package of European soccer deals that enable the brand to feature heavily through highly visible on-site, shirt and digital advertisements.</p>
<p>“We look forward to further engaging with sports fans in new markets all over the world, including in states across the U.S. where we are already this year making excellent headway,” Super Group CEO Menashe concluded.</p>
<p>Eyeing US Expansion</p>
<p>Also commenting on the update, SEAH Chairman Eric Grubman outlined the leadership position Betway has in Europe, looking forward to the brand’s continuous expansion into US markets, where it already teamed with major league franchises and has licenses to operate in 5 states.</p>
<p>Betway entered into partnership deals with the Dallas Mavericks, Philadelphia 76ers and Miami Heat of the NBA and recently went live in Iowa to add the Hawkeye State to Colorado, Indiana, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
<p>“We believe the SEAH and Super Group teams are synergistic together, given our overlap of careers in professional sports and of course their veteran status as global operators,” SEAH Chairman Grubman concluded.</p>
