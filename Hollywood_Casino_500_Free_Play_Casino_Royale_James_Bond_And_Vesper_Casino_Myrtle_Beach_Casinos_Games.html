<p>The content-driven iGaming technology provider catering to the online and land-based gambling sector with unique technology and games, Bragg Gaming Group, announced a new collaboration, strengthening its European presence. The company revealed it joined forces with Gran Madrid Casino Online for the regulated gambling market in Spain.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted deal, Bragg agreed to supply exclusive studio partner content for the gambling operator. This enabled Gran Madrid Casino Online to deliver new, engaging and feature-rich games for its growing customer base.</p>
<p>The partnership represents an important collaboration for the two companies. On one hand, the deal helps deliver new content for Gran Madrid Casino Online, which was the first operator to launch online gambling in the country back in 2011 when it first obtained its license. Since then, the operator has been continuously growing its portfolio of content to deliver unique and thrilling titles to its customers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the collaboration enables Bragg to expand the reach of its content to new audiences in Spain. Judging by projections from H2 Gambling Capital, the most trusted data and intelligence solutions provider, the market in the country represents a significantly important jurisdiction for the Old Continent. This is because, according to H2 Gambling Capital, the online gambling market in the country is expected to be worth some $628 million this year.</p>
<p>José Félix Herreros, Gran Madrid Online Casino's Country Manager, shared his excitement in a statement. He outlined: "The addition of Bragg’s comprehensive range of titles enables us to boost our offering and provide our customers with unique gaming experiences." Finally, Herreros noted: "As we continue to grow our brand, we highly value this strategically important collaboration with Bragg, a leading provider in the iGaming space."</p>
<p>Only recently, Bragg expanded further its European presence via a Pasino.ch deal in Switzerland. The collaboration enabled the company to boost its presence in the country by bringing exclusive and high-performing games for Pasino.ch. For the operator, this deal helped strengthen its growing position within the market by leveraging unique and quality iGaming titles.</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the latest deal, the one with Gran Madrid, Bragg's President and Chief Operating Officer, Lara Falzon, was incredibly excited about the recent tie-up. She said: "We're delighted to have launched our content with Gran Madrid Casino Online, providing a broad and rich portfolio of exclusive and high-quality casino titles that we’re sure Spanish players will enjoy."</p>
<p>"This latest rollout is part of our ambitious growth plans for the year as we look to continue our expansion across key regulated European markets and beyond," explained Falzon in conclusion.</p>
