<p>Golden State Warriors Have Astronomical Odds at Westgate SuperBook</p>

<p>The Golden State Warriors won 67 games in the regular season last year and their second NBA title in three years. With the team largely returning intact, led by former MVPs Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, oddsmakers believe the 2017/18 championship is the Warriors’ to lose.</p>

<p>With the best record in the NBA the last three years, there would seem to be little to no chance that the defending champs don’t at least make the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook puts the Warriors’ playoff odds at a staggering 1-1000, a record preseason future line. SuperBook Assistant Manager Jeff Sherman tells ESPN that the price is the highest “ever placed on a favorite to make the playoffs.”</p>
<p>At 1-1000, a $100 bet on Golden State making the playoffs will return 10 cents. The SuperBook’s implied odds of the team making the postseason is 99.9 percent.</p>
<p>For those who like to bet on the unthinkable, a lofty reward is theirs should hell freeze over. The SuperBook has the Warriors at 100-1 to miss the playoffs, meaning a $100 wager would net $10,000 should that most unlikely scenario become a reality.</p>
<p>Attractive Futures</p>
<p>While only the most committed Warriors hater might take the SuperBook on its 100-1 line, regular season over/under win totals perhaps present more attractive options for basketball bettors.</p>
<p>Golden State is on top of the league with 67.5 wins. Westgate will take wagers up to $1,000 on season win totals.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprising is that the Cleveland Cavaliers, a team that’s reached the NBA Finals the last three years, isn’t expected to win the most games in the Eastern Conference. That distinction belongs to the Boston Celtics with 55 wins, a franchise that remains engaged in the trade process for Cleveland’s perennial all-star point guard Kyrie Irving.</p>
<p>The trade holdup surrounds the health of Isaiah Thomas. Cleveland’s medical team reportedly didn’t like the results of Thomas’ physical, and are concerned regarding the recovery of the star’s hip.</p>
<p>The SuperBook has the Cavs at 53.5 wins, 2.5 more victories than last season. Discussing the odds on their ESPN show Mike &amp; Mike, sports analysts Mike Golic and Mike Greenberg both opined that they would take the over on Cleveland. As for the Warriors, Greenberg said he has “no way of guessing which way to go on that.”</p>
<p>Other notable teams include the San Antonio Spurs (54.5), Oklahoma City Thunder (51.5), and Minnesota Timberwolves (48.5).</p>
<p>Bottom Feeders</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the Chicago Bulls are seen by oddsmakers as the worst team in the NBA. Following the departure of Jimmy Butler to the Wolves and Rajon Rondo to New Orleans, and the future of Dwayne Wade in limbo, the SuperBook thinks the Bulls will win just 22.5 games.</p>
<p>Cleveland will be hoping the worst team is once again the Brooklyn Nets, which the SuperBook has at 27.5 wins. Should the Irving for Thomas trade be completed, the Cavs would hold the Nets’ unprotected 2018 first-round draft pick.</p>
<p>Other teams with long odds of making the playoffs include the Atlanta Hawks (25.5), Phoenix Suns (28.5), and New York Knicks (31).</p>
