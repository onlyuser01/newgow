<p>Josh Shaw has been suspended all through the 2020 season after he was caught betting on NFL games. Shaw claims his innocence. The athlete may reapply for the 2021 season.</p>
<p>Josh Shaw Receives NFL Suspension Through 2020</p>
<p>The National Football League (NFL) has suspended Arizona Cardinals member Josh Shaw through 2020 season over betting on season games. In the official statement, the NFL specified that the league had found evidence pointing to gambling activity by Shaw.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the Cardinals’ player bet on multiple occasions, which is in violation with NFL rules. The investigation also focused on whether any of Shaw’s peers were aware of the fact, including players, teammates and coaches.</p>
<p>Commenting the suspension, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had this to say:</p>
<p>“The continued success of the NFL depends directly on each of us doing everything necessary to safeguard the integrity of the game and the reputations of all who participate in the league.</p>
<p>At the core of this responsibility is the longstanding principle that betting on NFL games, or on any element of a game, puts at risk the integrity of the game, damages public confidence in the NFL, and is forbidden under all circumstances If you work in the NFL in any capacity, you may not bet on NFL football.”</p>
<p>Even though Shaw was on the team’s injured reserve, the NFL considered the betting to be in violation of league rules. Shaw has been on injury reserve for a while.</p>
<p>Josh Shaw Went to Las Vegas to Bet</p>
<p>According to Ian Rapoport, an NFL insider, Shaw went to Las Vegas and bet on NFL games, violating league rules, i.e. no betting is allowed on NFL games by anyone involved with the organization.</p>
<p>Even though the investigation found no evidence of Shaw leveraging inside knowledge to gain an unfair advantage, the ruling still applies. Moving forward, Shaw will need to reapply to be reinstated for the 2021 season, but following his IR stint, this may be proving too long that the athlete has been off the game.</p>
<p>Here’s what Rapoport’s tweet stated specifically:</p>
<p>On the Josh Shaw suspension, via sources close to him: Shaw went to a Vegas casino this fall with buddies from HS. He’s on IR &amp; hasn’t been around the team since preseason. Shaw placed sports bets for the 1st time based on misinterpreted understanding of the Supreme Court ruling — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) November 29, 2019</p>
<p>In another tweet, he added: “He [Josh Shaw] used his own player card &amp; ID. Shaw flew to NY immediately upon notice to meet with the NFL &amp; cooperated fully. Shaw has the opportunity to appeal what is the harshest gambling penalty in decades. He considers it an innocent mistake with a severe outcome.”</p>
<p>Shaw is likely to seek and mend fences with the NFL sooner, as he considers his betting a sincere mistake, and not an attempt to cover up an attempt to use his position to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>Previously, Shaw was suspended by USC for lying about an injury, after an interview with the Los Angeles Times.</p>
