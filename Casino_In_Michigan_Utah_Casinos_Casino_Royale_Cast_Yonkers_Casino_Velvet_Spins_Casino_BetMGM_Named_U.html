    <h1>Casino In Michigan Utah Casinos Casino Royale Cast Yonkers Casino Velvet Spins Casino BetMGM Named U</h1>

<p>Sports betting and gaming brand BetMGM announced it has partnered with retired US soccer star Tim Howard to hire the most-capped goalkeeper in the history of the men’s national team as a celebrity brand ambassador.</p>
<p>‘A Similar Level of Excitement’</p>
<p>The addition of Howard to the team of BetMGM ambassadors marks the commencement of a series of free-to-play games and promotions the brand has planned in conjunction with the upcoming international matches and events from the world of soccer.</p>
<p>Matt Prevost, chief revenue officer at BetMGM, hailed Howard’s performances as inspiring for an entire generation of US soccer fans, convinced that a combination between BetMGM and Howard’s popularity will achieve “a similar level of excitement” for the series of games and interactive opportunities the brand will be offering to its players.</p>
<p>In his role as a celebrity brand ambassador, the former player of English Premier League Manchester United and later on, Everton FC, will engage with BetMGM players and members of the MGM Rewards loyalty program during public and private events, utilizing virtual channels and in-person meetings.</p>
<p>“America’s excitement for soccer is at a fever pitch and I can’t wait to take it to the next level with BetMGM, offering new ways for fans to get engaged in the game,” said Howard, who will also feature through BetMGM social media content and as a guest on national radio and TV programs.</p>
<p>“BetMGM is at the forefront of the sports betting industry and I’m proud to be part of the team ahead of the greatest tournament in all of sports,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Prediction Game, Shootout Challenge, Free Bets</p>
<p>Throughout the 2022 tournament, free-to-play games and daily challenges launched by BetMGM will include a $250,000 grand prize prediction game, $250,000 Bracket, requiring players to predict a perfect bracket and providing a consolation prize of $50,000 to the user with the most accurate bracket prediction in case there is no one with a perfect bracket.</p>
<p>A daily shootout against the goalie will also be available via the Tim Howard’s Shootout Challenge free-to-play game and will be rewarding participants with a range of prizes including $100 of free bets.</p>
<p>For new customers, BetMGM offers a risk-free bet of up to $1,000 during the tournament, while every new user’s first bet of $10 will be rewarded with $200 in free bets if a goal is scored.</p>
<p>BetMGM did not forget its existing players, offering them access to a portfolio of benefits, including risk-free, one-game parlay wagers, daily odds boosts and tokens, as well as a first-goal scorer wager insurance.</p>
<p>Free-to-play games and promotions will be available to BetMGM players in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming in the US, as well as Ontario in Canada.</p>
