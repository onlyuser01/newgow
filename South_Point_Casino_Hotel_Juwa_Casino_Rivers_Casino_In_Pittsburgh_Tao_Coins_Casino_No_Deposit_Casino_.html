<p>For the Seattle Seahawks, the playoff race is over. They will not make the playoffs whatever happens in Week 18. For their opponents, the Arizona Cardinals, it’s a whole different story. Even if they end up losing on Sunday, they will qualify for the postseason via Wild Card. However, if they win, they could even win themselves the NFC West division.</p>

<p>The End of Pete Carroll-Russell Wilson Era?</p>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks will not make the playoffs this season, which is going to be only the second time since Russell Wilson’s been made their starting quarterback. Further, this is going to be the third time Carroll-led Seahawks will miss the postseason.</p>
<p>Speaking of the two, there are rumors that the Seahawks vs Cardinals could be the very final game they work together. Coach Carroll is the oldest coach in the league, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if he decided to retire at the end of the season. In fact, he might be forced to do so, following the disappointing record this season.</p>
<p>When it comes to Russell Wilson, the franchise legend is reportedly looking to move to another team. Online sportsbooks see the Denver Broncos as his next destination, with the odds of just +300.</p>
<p>The Cardinals Determined to Win the NFC West</p>
<p>The Cards are trailing behind the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC West, with just one win fewer than the #1 team. However, they have a better divisional record than the Rams, which means that if they finish with the same overall record, the Cards will win the division.</p>
<p>For that to happen, the Rams need to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, which is not impossible. After all, the Niners are in a need of a win to secure a place in the postseason.</p>
<p>Apart from seeing the Rams lose on Sunday, the Cardinals also need to win their game. They need to beat the Seahawks for the second time this season. The first time, they beat them 23-13 in Seattle. This time, the game’s played in Glendale, where the Cards are without a win in their previous four games. Maybe it’s time to end the losing streak?</p>
<p>Picks: Arizona Cardinals to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
