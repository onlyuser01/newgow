    <h1>The Palms Casino Las Vegas Montreal Casino Treasure Island Casino Minnesota The Pass Casino Casino O</h1>

<p>That was a big mistake.</p>
<p>In every casino the general terms and conditions contain exactly this point.</p>
<p>If you open an account, you can ONLY pay with YOUR card that is in your name.</p>
<p>Once you send a payment to the casino from another account, the casino has the right to confiscate the winnings with that deposited money.</p>
<p>If you really deposited from your wife's account you can only hope that the casino will turn a blind eye otherwise it will be difficult to get this money as it is a violation of their policies which casinos follow very strictly.</p>
<p>I wish you luck!</p>
<p>But the next time, NEVER use someone else's account, which can have fatal consequences.</p>
<p>One question, if you were a casino owner and spelled it all out in the terms and conditions and a customer had a big win like yours with €100,000 but it's illegal because the rules were broken, would you or would you pay that person €100.00? make use of the general terms and conditions that are on your site and save yourself 100,000€?</p>
<p>You really have to be careful when you play and follow the rules.</p>
<p>I don't want to spoil your hope or anything but paying with another card is very unwise as the casino will refer to it.</p>
