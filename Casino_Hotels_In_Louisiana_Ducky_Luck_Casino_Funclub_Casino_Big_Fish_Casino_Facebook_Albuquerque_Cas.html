<p>The leading gaming industry operator in Europe, Stanleybet Group, continues its European expansion after securing another license. The company said Monday it secured a retail license in Andalusia, Spain.</p>
<p>Stanleybet Continues European Expansion</p>
<p>Thanks to the new license, Stanleybet further expands its European footprint. Moreover, the license complements the company’s expansion in the country as well. Currently, Stanleybet anticipates opening its first retail location in Spain in Malaga. The rollout is planned for the first quarter of next year. Now, the license in Andalusia will allow the leading operator to further expand its offering in the country and is expected to help it gain market share.</p>
<p>Antonio Stanzani, Stanleybet’s country manager for Spain, revealed that the “Spanish model envisages two types of shops.” One type of betting shop is the so-called “salon de juegos,” which leverages the affiliate model and involves operation by a private third party. On the other hand, there are also “tienda de apuestas,” betting venues that are operated and opened under the same operator.</p>
<p>“Our first shop will be a “tienda de apuestas”, to imprint and export our style also in Andalusia, but we are already in contact with several Spanish entrepreneurs who have chosen Stanleybet to start thriving and lasting partnerships in the betting and gaming industry, in which we have been a leader since 1958.“ Antonio Stanzani, country manager for Spain at Stanleybet</p>
<p>He pointed out that Stanleybet has already used the two models which brought success for the company in Cyprus and Belgium. According to Stanzani, the company proved to be a success by leveraging the two types of betting shops and the flexibility they offer. Stanzani added that the company’s first shop in Spain will be the “tienda de apuestas” type. Finally, he explained that Stanleybet is already in touch with entrepreneurs in Spain that are interested in collaborating with the company and engaging in partnerships.</p>
<p>License Was Delayed Due to the Pandemic</p>
<p>Giovanni Garrisi, Stanleybet’s CEO, revealed that the company initially started the process for obtaining a license back in 2019. However, he pointed out, that the pandemic impacted this complex process but the operator did not give up and agreed with the Andalusian authorities to resume the licensing once the pandemic goes away.</p>
<p>“Now, after obtaining the retail license for sports betting also in this other highly regulated European country, we are ready to expand into a new market, Spain, which offers great opportunities for our sector.“ Giovanni Garrisi, CEO at Stanleybet Group</p>
<p>Garrisi added that with the license secured, now the company gains entry into another major retail market in Europe. He acknowledged that the Andalusian market holds significant growth potential. Last but not least Garrisi said: “We will start from Malaga, where we are already working on the opening of the first shop, scheduled for the first quarter of 2023, and then continue in the other cities.”</p>
