<p>One of the largest gaming technology groups in the world, leading producer and operator, NOVOMATIC AG Group, announced Tuesday that it upgraded its international environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating. The company revealed that the rating agency that specializes in sustainability, ISS ESG (Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.), upgraded its rating, acknowledging improvements in multiple key areas.</p>
<p>As a result, NOVOMATIC was recognized with a "C" rating for the first time, positioning the company among the top 30% of the electronic industry on a global scale. The latest achievement placed the company on a list of global leaders such as HP, DELL and Apple, among others.</p>
<p>Currently, ISS ESG is one of the three leading ESG rating agencies in the world. The company operates along with Moody’s ESG Solutions and Sustainalytics, evaluating the sustainability of businesses across the globe and recognizing their ESG efforts.</p>
<p>Johannes Gratzl, NOVOMATIC's Board Member, commented on the topic in a statement. "We are delighted that our extensive commitment to sustainability has now been recognized by ISS ESG with a top rating," he explained. Finally, Gratzl pointed out: "With this rating, we have made a great leap forward, and our level of transparency is now at the highest level. We are also well above the industry average when it comes to the core issue of working conditions and standards."</p>
<p>Ryszard Presch, an Executive Board Member at NOVOMATIC, was similarly thrilled. "As an international gaming technology group, we have always assumed social responsibility and act conscientiously and transparently in all areas of our business," he added.</p>
<p>The company secured important awards and top ratings for its commitment to ESG. Only recently, NOVOMATIC was recognized as the industry winner within PwC’s ESG Ranking 2023, underlining its dedication toward sustainability.</p>
<p>When it comes to the recently upgraded rating from ISS ESG, the recognition acknowledges improvements in multiple strategic areas. Those areas include "Corporate governance and business ethics", "Society and product responsibility", as well as "Employees and suppliers." The upgraded rating from ISS ESG reaffirmed that ESG is an inseparable part of NOVOMATIC's corporate strategy.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, NOVOMATIC expanded its global footprint via a partnership with Tecnet Asia. Announced in July, the Asia-facing deal designated Tecnet Asia as the company's official distributor for the Philippines. The strategic collaboration helped propel the reach of NOVOMATIC's leading technology for the region, allowing it to reach new customers.</p>
