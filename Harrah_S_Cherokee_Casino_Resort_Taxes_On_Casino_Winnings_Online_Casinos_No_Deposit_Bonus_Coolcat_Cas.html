    <h1>Harrah S Cherokee Casino Resort Taxes On Casino Winnings Online Casinos No Deposit Bonus Coolcat Cas</h1>

<p>Hi, The problem is that I made a Crazy Time win of 1501.50 euros (1 attachment) and it was not credited to me. I wrote to the live chat and they told me that the finance department was doing some checks (which is already weird). Then an assistant told me that the win was in order and that I should clear the cache and cookies and the money would be credited (2 attachment). Then another assistant told me that I had to make one last bet and that the money would then be credited (3 attachment). Now I still don't have the money and they say the finance department need to do some checks this is madness they can't keep my money for no reason. I also have the ID screen of the winning transaction with the time and date that coincide perfectly with the max win of the Crazy time of the day in question (attachments 4 and 5). The casino is aware of the problem, but it's been 2 days and they say to wait for an email from the department, but it's not possible they have my money won honestly. I also have no guarantees that they are actually working on it.</p>
<p>You can also notice that after any play in the history of the balance, if it is a loser there is win = 0 if it is a winner there is win= amount won. In the case of my winning bet there is nothing, as if it had not been paid</p>
