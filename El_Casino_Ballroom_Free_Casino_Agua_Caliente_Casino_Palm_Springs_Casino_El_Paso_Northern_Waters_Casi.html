<p>B2B supplier of multimedia horseracing solutions PA Betting Services is pressing on the LATAM market through a partnership with the Chilean horseracing data and media outlet ElTurf.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Will Combine Their Forces</p>
<p>The services provided by the two partners will include both pre-race data and live broadcasts, accompanied by data. The latter will be provided by PA Media Group’s brand StreamAMG.</p>
<p>ElTurf, in turn, will integrate its LATAM in-running data and pricing service to PA Betting Services’ platform. The solution was developed by Total Performance Data – a well-known industry specialist.</p>
<p>The two partners will work to feature over 2,000 Sporting Valparaiso, Hipódromo de Chile, and Club Hipico de Concepcion races annually. Both PA Betting Services and ElTurf will bring show the best their brands can offer as both of them try to provide pre-race content that elevates the local betting experience to a level comparable to the ones in the British and North American markets.</p>
<p>The Partnership Will Benefit the Local Market</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the two companies spoke about the partnership.</p>
<p>PA Betting Services’ head of business and development, Richard Duncan, shared that his party feels thrilled to work together with ElTurf and the LATAM race track. He is excited to be a part of the Latin American market’s quest to maximize racing profits through strategic partnerships.</p>
<p>“Global racing has much to offer with the quality of racing from these courses as good as many domestic UK races. With knowledge gaps now plugged, Latin American racing will be an exciting proposition for operators crying out for an improved product that includes silks, runner comments, race verdicts, and more competitive margins,” Duncan said.</p>
<p>Duncan added that PA Betting Services is really delighted to be able to provide ElTurf with the StreamAMG solution. He is convinced that PA Media Group’s talent and knowledge will provide real added value to all LATAM customers.</p>
<p>ElTurf’s chief executive officer, Gonzalo Reyes, shares Duncan’s sentiments and said that his company is just excited to work with PA Betting Services. Reyes is sure that this partnership will advance the interests of Latin American racing into new markets.</p>
<p>Reyes is optimistic that the relationship between ElTurf and PA “marks a new chapter for those racecourses seeking a move away from legacy providers and grants them the opportunity to maximize revenues from fixed-odds and pari-mutuel markets around the globe.”</p>
<p>The CEO believes that the pairing of ElTurf’s leading LATAM coverage and PA Betting Services’ state-of-the-art distribution platform will dramatically increase the standard of local horseracing content. This will benefit both the industry and the local fans.</p>
