<p>The world‚Äôs first esports team and bookie-backed CS:GO league is a fact with ten organizations rallying behind FLASHPOINT League and Pinnacle becoming the event‚Äôs official betting partner.</p>
<p>Pinnacle-backed FLASHPOINT League Kicks Off</p>
<p>FLASHPOINT League is finally shifting into gear after ten esports organizations have agreed to back the competition. The new CS:GO event will draw financial and branding backing from established gaming powerhouses, such as Cloud9, Dignitas and Gen.G, and with Pinnacle, an esports bookmaker, becoming the official betting sponsor for the league.</p>
<p>The next chapter to our CS:GO legacy starts today.</p>
<p>Announcing today @Envy as the 7th founding member @FLASHPOINT, the only league owned and run by teams!</p>

<p>Pinnacle will also be the official pre-show sponsor as well as run comprehensive fan-driven activities, such as polls, social media campaigns as well as offer odds for upcoming matches. The league is the first official team-backed esports competition to partner with a betting company and make it its flagship sponsor.</p>
<p>Then again, Pinnacle has a track record for being one of the most reliable betting companies. And one of the earliest adopters of the vertical. In fact, Pinnacle even runs an in-play betting service, allowing live wagering on fans‚Äô favorite teams.</p>
<p>FLASHPOINT Global Qualifier groups, schedule released https://t.co/sIaou1hvjL ‚Äî HLTV.org (@HLTVorg) February 25, 2020</p>
<p>With now a few days into the Pinnacle Open ‚Äì which launched on March 3 ‚Äì the organization is nearing the launch of the FLASHPOINT tournament which will unfold in Los Angeles on March 13. Despite the profile of CS:GO as not the most populous game out there, some 1,800 entrants vied for a chance during the regional qualifiers played from February 6 through February 17, 2020.</p>
<p>A number of decent up-and-coming teams failed to make the cut though. Names such as AVEZ, Redemption, and Copenhagen Flames lost in the qualifiers.</p>
<p>Bring Betting Organizations and Esports Organizations Closer Together</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Gen.G co-founder Kent Wakeford expressed the team‚Äôs excitement to be partnering up with Pinnacle. Wakeford said that the league should be one of the most entertaining products that the world has seen to date. He further added that fans will have an opportunity to interact with players in new and exciting ways.</p>
<p>Pinnacle‚Äôs CEO Paris Smith has also spoken on the occasion. He highlighted the company‚Äôs passion for esports and continuous investment in the segment over the last decade. Smith also said that partnering with FLASHPOINT was an opportunity for the bookmaker to achieve further goals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt the very outset we were aligned in our goals of helping the industry grow and the esports community thrive,‚Äù Smith added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve built a solid track record, and we‚Äôre very excited about what the next chapter has in store.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FLASHPOINT League will feature a massive $2 million in cash prize. Not the highest prize pool out there, but definitely an impressive amount and far greater than other CS:GO events. Pinnacle remains one of the flagship sponsors of esports events together with brands such as Betway, Unikrn, and others.</p>
