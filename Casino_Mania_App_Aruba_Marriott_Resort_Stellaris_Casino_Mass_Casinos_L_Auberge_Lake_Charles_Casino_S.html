<p>A Woman from Minnesota Charged over Alleged Embezzlement</p>
<p>Fortune Bay Resort Casino employee was charged over alleged embezzlement of more than $315,000. Jennifer Lynn Boutto, age 32, allegedly embezzled some $315,739.87, according to documents filed with the District Court in Minneapolis last week Monday. United States Attorney Erica MacDonald for the District of Minnesota alleges that the thefts occurred over a 6-year period from June 2013 through October 2019.</p>
<p>Since the filing of the charging document on December 14, no further details were disclosed by the Department of Justice explaining how Ms. Boutto allegedly managed to embezzle the amount from the tribal operator.</p>
<p>The Fortune Bay Resort Casino is located in Tower, a city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota. The resort is only 25 miles away from the Canadian border and it has more than 170 hotel rooms. Furthermore, the resort offers multiple food outlets, an indoor pool, and a bingo hall. The casino floor has 800 slot machines, 4 poker tables, 12 blackjack tables, and it is owned and operated by the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa.</p>
<p>Public Defendant Assigned to Ms. Boutto</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Federal Criminal Code Title 18, Section 1163, anyone who embezzles, steals, or knowingly converts to his use the money, funds, credits, or other goods belonging to any Indian tribal organization may be fined or imprisoned up to five years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, such individuals may be both fined and imprisoned. The criminal code makes an exception if the sum does not exceed $1,000 and in such case, if a person is found guilty under the title may be fined or imprisoned or both for no more than one year.</p>
<p>The alleged felony case of Ms. Boutto is assigned to Judge Eric C. Tostrud. Currently, the lady is not in police custody. According to court records, attorney Lisa Lopez was assigned as a public defender to Ms. Boutto.</p>
