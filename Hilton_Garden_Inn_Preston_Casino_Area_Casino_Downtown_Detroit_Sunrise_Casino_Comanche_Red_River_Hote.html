<p>Three new titles to join the portfolio of first-person games by Evolution Gaming in a bid to expand innovation in the live iGaming segment.</p>
<p>Evolution Games Adds to First Person iGaming Portfolio</p>
<p>Live casino game colossus Evolution Gaming has added three new games to its first-person table game collection. The announcement came today, May 14, when the company revealed three new entries: First-Person Baccarat, First-Person Dragon Tiger and First-Person Football Studio.</p>
<p>With this move Evolution Gaming is investing in the First-Person RNG games. Furthermore, the games have available the “GO LIVE” functionality. All three games are based on the highly successful live dealer table games by Evolution: Dragon Tiger and Baccarat, which are all-time casino classics. Meanwhile, Football Studio is a top card football themed game.</p>
<p>Starting in 2006, Evolution Gaming has proved to be one of the top casino game developers. Helping licensed operators grow and providing superb user experience, for Evolution Gaming the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>But here is what Evolution Gaming Chief Product Officer Todd Haushalter had to say about the three new titles:</p>
<p>Our goal when creating the First Person games was to make the world’s best RNG table games. When our first two games, First Person Roulette and Blackjack, were launched we agonised over ensuring that the 3D graphics and performance were perfect. We also included the “GO LIVE” button to take players to the live version of the same game. Those first two titles proved incredibly popular so we broadened our goal to include RNG versions of our game show games. Now we’re launching another trio of First Person games to add even more variety.”</p>
<p>Insight on The First-Person Versions of The Popular Games</p>
<p>The first-person version of Baccarat places the player in a virtual game hall. Players are treated as VIP clients and can choose between 12 tables. Half of the tables are standard ones while the other half is No Commission tables. The player has the choice to shuffle the shoe, sort tables by streaks and also deal free hands on vacant tables to build trends.</p>
<p>The next title on the list, the Dragon Tiger also offers players a full control over the gameplay, more or less. The RNG game is really easy to play and the goal is to choose which card will be higher. Players bet on one of two cards – Dragon or Tiger and upon revealing the outcome synchronized light effects are played to boost up the casino experience.</p>
<p>Last but not least, first-person Football Studio is a Top card RNG game. Similar to Dragon Tiger, the game is easy to play. Players get to choose one of two cards which are dealt face-up on a virtual football pitch table. The players can bet on either “Home Win“, “Away Win” or “Draw“, while at the same time monitoring live match updates.</p>
