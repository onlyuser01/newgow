<p>The provider of lottery games, analytics, services and technology for government-sponsored lottery programs around the globe, Scientific Games, announced Monday it signed a new multi-year agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery Global Themed Entertainment for the delivery of new thrilling online and retail lottery games. The company confirmed that thanks to the new collaboration, it will bring HBO's Game of Thrones-branded digital and retail lottery games. Representing the first such games for the lottery sector, the titles are expected to deliver unique and thrilling experiences for fans of the iconic series.</p>
<p>Expanding its partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery Global Themed Entertainment, who currently hold limited worldwide rights on the epic brand, Scientific Games is expected to bring Fast Play games, digital lottery games, as well as instant scratch games that are Game of Thrones-branded.</p>
<p>Prior to signing the agreement, Scientific Games conducted consumer research in an effort to identify how appealing the brand can be. This research, which measures the "intensity of liking" for brands, highlighted the potential of the globally-recognized brand for lottery games.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration helps expand further Scientific Games' continuously growing offering, delivering once again games that are likely to appeal to a range of audiences and bring unique experiences. According to a statement released by the company, for the fiscal year 2022, the licensed branded games developed by Scientific Games for lotteries around the United States hit $2.7 billion in retail sales.</p>
<p>Scientific Games' Vice President of North American Instant Products, Kyle Rogers, explained that the company's research indicated that Game of Thrones is a "right-fit brand for the company's next blockbuster lottery Linked Games which will be announced soon." As a global company, it offers a wide range of licensed brands within the global lottery industry.</p>
<p>It was back in 2007 when Scientific Games announced the launch of Linked Games winners' events that featured more than 30 unique events for the lottery vertical. Since the launch of Linked Games, more than 3,000 lucky winners have secured unique experiences and at the same time, some $4.8 billion in retail sales were generated.</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Rogers noted: "Our global teams are ecstatic to add a powerful brand Game of Thrones to our licensed properties portfolio." He added that the brand is recognized around the globe and is known to attract a growing audience within social media and the gaming vertical.</p>
<p>"There is so much iconography associated with the TV series that it works creatively with our omnichannel lottery games," added Rogers. In conclusion, Scientific Games' Vice President of North American Instant Products pointed out: "Although it appeals to a younger generation of players, multi-generations of viewers watched Game of Thrones around the world, so it has the potential to bring its massive fanbase and social media following to lottery."</p>
