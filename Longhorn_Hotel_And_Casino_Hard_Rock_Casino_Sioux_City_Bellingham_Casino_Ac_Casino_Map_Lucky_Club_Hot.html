<p>Arsenal vs. Manchester United is undoubtedly the biggest matchup of the fourth round of the 2023-24 English Premier League</p>
<p>Both teams have huge ambitions for the 2023-24 EPL campaign, but neither Arsenal nor Manchester United has been too impressive since the start of the season. The Gunners failed to beat 10-men Fulham last weekend, while the Red Devils defeated 10-men Nottingham Forest 3-2 with the winner scored from the penalty spot.</p>

<p>Arsenal Players to Show What They’re Made Of</p>
<p>Last season, the Gunners were at the top of the table until the closing couple of weeks when Manchester City leapfrogged them. They failed to win the title, but they’re planning to do it this time around. The evidence of how seriously everyone at Arsenal feels about challenging for the title is that this team’s signed some really good players during the summer transfer window – Kai Havertz, Declan Rice, and so on.</p>
<p>However, the new signings haven’t impressed anyone thus far. Add to that the fact that the Gunners were struggling with injuries (Oleksandr Zinchenko, Gabriel Jesus, and so on) and you’ll understand why they haven’t been too impressive in the 2023-24 season.</p>
<p>They did, however, win two games before drawing 2-2 with Fulham last weekend. Still, those wins happened against Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, two mediocre Premier League teams to say the least.</p>
<p>Manchester United Hates Playing in London</p>
<p>In the previous five Arsenal vs. Man Utd Premier League duels that took place in London, the home team won four times, while one of the games finished in a draw. Further, the last time the Red Devils traveled to the capital city of the United Kingdom, they lost 2-0 to Tottenham.</p>
<p>The Tottenham game is the only away game they’ve played so far in the 2023-24 Premier League, but even in the two home games they weren’t too impressive. Sure, they did beat Wolves 1-0 and Nottingham Forest 3-2, but they struggled in both of those.</p>
<p>Against Wolves, they won thanks to a goal scored by defender Raphael Varane. Against Nottingham Forest, they won thanks to a penalty goal by Bruno Fernandez just a couple of minutes after one of the opposition players got sent off.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs. Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>Arsenal dropped points against 10-men Fulham who scored the equalizer in the closing moments of the game. This has certainly made coach Mikel Arteta make some big changes, the result of which is that we’re likely to see his boys play more cautiously in their next game.</p>
<p>That said, we think it’s very likely the Gunners won’t allow too many goals on Sunday. At the same time, we don’t think they’ll score too many as well, which is why our top Arsenal vs. Manchester United prediction is that a draw will happen.</p>
<p>Pick: Arsenal vs. Manchester United to draw &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
