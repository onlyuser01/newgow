<p>Sports betting still isn’t legal in Massachusetts, despite multiple attempts. Some lawmakers and lobbyists have tried for years to find approval; however, resistance has been overwhelming. This isn’t going to stop a regional TV sports network based in the state from dropping a couple of its popular sports shows in favor of sports betting content. New England Sports Network (NESN) is preparing to give itself a makeover.</p>
<p>NESN is based in Massachusetts and serves the entire New England region – Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It covers virtually all games involving the Boston Red Sox, the Boston Celtics, and the Boston Bruins, and is part of Fox Sports Net’s broadcasting group. Coverage of the Boston teams is logical since the company is owned by a consortium that also owns those sports teams.</p>
<p>Now, NESN has announced that it will be canceling its daily sports news programs, NESN After Hours and NESN Sports Update. In their place will eventually be gambling content, according to a press release.</p>
<p>We will be sharing any updates or additions to our content offerings as soon as they become accessible, but sports betting content and short-form online content will be top priorities as our goal is to continue to provide programming that meets our audience’s needs.” NESN spokesperson</p>
<p>A few employees working behind the camera will need to find new work as a result of the pending changes. Others, however, will be sent to production teams for game coverage and other programming.</p>
<p>Both programs are scheduled to end their runs on March 11.</p>
<p>A New Era in Sports TV</p>
<p>Many NESN contributors received information about the changes over recent days, according to media outlet Boston.com. Some network contributors have been changing over recently, including Matt Chatham, a former New England Patriots linebacker, who announced that they would not be providing analysis for NESN.</p>
<p>NESN intends to expand its gambling content. Although details are still being worked on, it is possible to have Sam Panayotovich take a more leading role. Panayotivich is a current NESN and FOX Sports, gambling analyst. Prior to joining NESN, he held similar roles with WGN Radio, NBC Sports, and VSiN.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that “changing consumer preferences and content consumption habits” require a shift in the way the company utilizes its resources, as well as the content it delivers.</p>
