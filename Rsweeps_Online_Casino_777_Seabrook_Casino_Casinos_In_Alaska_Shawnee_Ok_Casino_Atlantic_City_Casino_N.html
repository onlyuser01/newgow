<p>Caesars hosts arcade show expo in August, 2019</p>
<p>The Toushinsai expected to attract well over 6,000 people</p>
<p>Caesars still eyes Japanese expansion</p>
<p>Caesars has teamed up with Japanese arcade games developer Taito to introduce a massive arcade expo in Las Vegas in 2019.</p>
<p>Caesars’ New Esports Ambitions Continue to Grow</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment has teamed up with Japanese company Taito to host one of the world’s largest arcade gaming events in Las Vegas. The focus is firmly on esports, a segment in which Caesars is a little more familiar with competitive gaming than most companies out there.</p>
<p>For starters, Caesars have hosted multiple esports competitions in Gears of War. Then, the company was one of the main backers of the H1Z1 League, which has been disbanded, but the event has helped put the casino operator on the radars.</p>
<p>[RT] TAITO hold the first North American qualifier in the history of TOUSHINSAI from 12 to 6pm PST on August 1! The category is "Street Fighter V Type Arcade" ! Entry from here https://t.co/2SORRX95kD TOUSHINSAI 2020 begins, See you there! #toushinsai pic.twitter.com/ydObXN312p — TOUSHINSAI_OFFICIAL_EN (@toushinsai_EN) July 1, 2019</p>
<p>Taito and Caesars will now work on creating the world’s largest arcade gaming show that will feature competitive gaming. Toushinsai, as the event is known, usually attracts over 6,000 people in Tokyo, Japan, where it is usually hosted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Las Vegas’ Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino is preparing to focus the event in August 1, 2019. The United States is one of the biggest hot spots for arcade gaming, both competitive and recreational.</p>
<p>Not All About Japan</p>
<p>Street Fighter V, one of the most famous fighting games, next to the Mortal Kombat series, will be part of the upcoming event, offering a rare opportunity to fans to organize one of the biggest arcade events the world has seen to date.</p>
<p>Caesars decision to get involved with yet another fringe esports segment is commendable. Even though arcade games and fighting games have more to do with community than any competitive format, the brand has done well in targeting segments that put it closer to the community. Caesars VP of Strategic Investment John Linss had the following to add:</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment is excited to host Toushinsai competitors from around the globe. Our company has long fostered the rapidly growing esports industry throughout our resorts, and we are happy to be collaborating with Taito to bring their e-Arcade sports qualifier to North America for the first time.</p>
<p>Mr. Linss is correct to conclude that the esports industry is growing and the ability of Caesars to identify such lucrative segments is definitely commendable to say the least.</p>
<p>Better Chances to Land an IR Spot?</p>
<p>Caesars is also eying an opportunity to enter in Japan’s future Integrated Resorts (IR) project which promises to be one of the most ambitious and best casino projects to date in terms of ROI.</p>
<p>The company has been trying to really push itself in establishing a more recognizable global footprint and one way to do so has been through charting a new course of expansion both in Asia and among youths.</p>
<p>Establishing a brand identity would be easier for Caesars with its recent forays into esports, especially now that Japan is becoming more open to the idea and professional players in the country are licensed professionals.</p>
<p>Still, Caesars has a lot of work to do to end up on the shortlist of candidates willing to be amongst the first in the IR project.</p>
