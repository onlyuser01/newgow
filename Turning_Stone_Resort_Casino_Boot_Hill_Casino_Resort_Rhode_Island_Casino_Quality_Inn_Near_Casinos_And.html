    <h1>Turning Stone Resort Casino Boot Hill Casino Resort Rhode Island Casino Quality Inn Near Casinos And</h1>

<p>We are living in the world of people, not businesses. Personal stories, real faces, reality of running your own brand — this is what society wants to know. They don’t care how some company has achieved amazing results. But the person who stands behind and makes it real — here is where the interest is.</p>
<p>A power of personal brand in figures</p>
<p>Personal branding is a powerful tool for professionals and businesses, as it helps build trust, credibility, and loyalty among customers and clients. Here are some statistics and examples that illustrate it:</p>
<p>Boosts brand loyalty: According to a study by Edelman, 64% of consumers said they trust a brand more if they see it in the news. Improves sales: A report by LinkedIn found that sales reps who use social selling techniques, such as building a personal brand, see a 45% increase in sales opportunities. Attract talents: A survey by CareerBuilder found that 70% of employers use social media to screen job candidates, and 57% of employers are less likely to interview a candidate if they can't find information about them online. Increase visibility: According to a survey by HubSpot, 70% of marketers say that building an audience is more important than building a product. Personal branding can differentiate a business from its competitors: According to a study by Nielsen, 59% of consumers prefer to buy new products from brands they are familiar with.</p>
<p>The main task of every business is to be remembered. So, when people have a question about whose brand will accompany them on a certain path, they have to remember your name without hesitation. This can be done through large-scale promoting events, external advertising and promotion through social media. Or you can simply declare yourself.</p>
<p>I chose the last strategy. But I have to say that it was not an easy decision. After all, through my worldview people perceive Gamzix, and they associate it with my name. This is a big responsibility, but also a huge opportunity.</p>
<p>What does your audience need?</p>
<p>First, content on behalf of a brand representative is perceived as a dialogue. And it looks like you have a personal conversation with each follower. If your thoughts coincide with the thoughts of the audience, your content (personal or professional) is perceived by people loyally.</p>
<p>Of course, we should not forget that it is impossible to build a connection with the audience solely on the content promoted by the company. A personal brand involves multifaceted communication. A personal look at certain things, useful tips, comments on important events: all these make you a person, and not a robot that only reposts from a corporate page.</p>
<p>This is how you can get not only an audience that is potentially interested in your product/service, but also those who like you personally. And this significantly expands the circle of your audience and its quality. Imagine how loyal to your business will be the people on whom you have already made an impression.</p>
<p>Always say "YES"</p>
<p>But to start this way, it is important to define the platform on which you will gather your community. If possible, I advise being present everywhere, but choose priority media. For my and Gamzix’s brands, LinkedIn has become a place where the important audience is. For the B2B segment, this is a great option.</p>
<p>But I also know people who refuse social media and stick to the idea: "It’s just not for me". "It doesn’t help". I can’t say that it was not an easy journey for me as well, but there is a thing I always tell in my interviews and which has become a ground rule of developing my company — follow trends and don’t be scared to try new things. Here are other reasons, in my opinion, why people are saying "No" to use personal brands:</p>
<p>Old-fashioned point of view . Companies may not realize that a strong personal brand can help them stand out in their industry, attract new opportunities, and establish themselves as thought leaders.</p>

<p>Ultimately, whether to build a personal brand is a decision that depends on individual goals, values, and preferences.</p>
<p>While the focus of personal branding in the gambling industry often falls on professional players, it can also be important for young studios.</p>
<p>Gamzix vs LinkedIn</p>
<p>I’m thrilled that I could create a powerful personal brand on LinkedIn with more than 12,000 followers – a loyal audience who supports, listens and gives valuable advice.</p>
<p>At Gamzix almost all C-levels build personal brands through social media. They share their moments, talk about work achievements and share news from the Gamzix corporate page. Someone reveals Gamzix thanks to their personal page, as a reliable partner, someone as a good employer, and someone as an amazing game provider. Different ideas which are based on the ground values, making personal branding a game changer.</p>
<p>Such a strategy creates a safe, loyal space and finds the right audience by sharing real stories of real people. Now it’s much easier for Gamzix to develop its brand and get better coverage for its corporate profile on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Overall, developing a personal brand in iGaming can be highly effective for individuals who want to establish themselves as experts, build a loyal following and help their company to stand out from the Internet crowd. However, it requires dedication, consistency, and authenticity to truly make an impact. Just try once and you will succeed!</p>
