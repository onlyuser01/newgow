<p>TwinSpires, CDI’s digital foray into the betting and gaming space, has completed its successful transition onto GAN Limited’s platform.</p>
<p>GAN Completes Successful TwinSpires Migration</p>
<p>GAN Limited continues to deepen its connection with TwinSpires, Churchill Downs Incorporated’s sports betting and iGaming operators in several jurisdictions in the United States. On Monday, the company announced the successful transition of the online gambling brand onto its platform in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>GAN also launched inaugural sports betting operations with TwinSpires in Colorado and had previously assisted the brand with establishing a foothold in Tennessee and Michigan. The successful product launches make TwinSpires currently active in five states and allow the brand to benefit from GAN’s tailored sports betting solutions ahead of the Kentucky Derby on May 1.</p>
<p>GAN is now involved with TwinSpires sportsbook in Michigan, Colorado, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, a press release stated.</p>
<p>The gaming solutions provider has leveraged its player account management platform to facilitate day-to-day operations at TwinSpires and similarly help it manage its casino offerings in Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>
<p>Looking into Opportunities beyond Retail</p>
<p>GAN’s proprietary technology guarantees customers an unrivaled onboarding experience that translates into flawless betting or casino gambling sessions. Commenting on the news, GAN CEO Dermot Smurfit congratulated the in-house team on completing the transition:</p>
<p>“The team did an amazing job of concurrently migrating and launching TwinSpires’ Sportsbook &amp; iGaming offering in three states in the span of a week, which serves to highlight our speed to market and unique capabilities to seamlessly handle highly complex migrations.” GAN CEO Dermot Smurfit</p>
<p>Smurfit said that GAN remained confident in the future partnership between Churchill Downs Incorporated and his company and looking to replicate CDI’s long-standing success in land-based gaming in the online sports betting and iGaming verticals as well.</p>
<p>CDI’s president of online gaming, Ian Williams, was happy with what turned out to be a successful and ambitious move right ahead of the landmark horse racing event, the Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>Williams was optimistic about the company’s prospects in all available segments, including sports betting and iGaming, with TwinSpires’ offer now available to punters in five states.</p>
