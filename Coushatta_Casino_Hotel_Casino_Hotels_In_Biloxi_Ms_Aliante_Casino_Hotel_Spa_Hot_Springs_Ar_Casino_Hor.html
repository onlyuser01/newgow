<p>Red Tiger Gaming, a leading supplier of online casino software, has expanded its reach by signing a deal with Aktiebolaget Trav och Galopp (ATG) – a Scandinavian entertainment and leisure provider.</p>
<p>Red Tiger Gaming Expands Nordics Influence</p>
<p>The deal will see Red Tiger Gaming launch its critically-acclaimed suite of slot games in the key Swedish market. Sweden, being one of the fastest-growing betting jurisdictions in Europe, has been highly appealing to numerous betting companies. The country’s online punters have substantially increased in the past few years and the Swedish gambling industry has flourished.</p>
<p>ATG has a special place in the Swedish betting market. The company is owned by the local trotting and thoroughbred associations and as such, was the only one to offer betting on horseracing between 1974 and 2018. After it lost its monopoly after one of the SGA’s numerous regulation changes, the operator sought to expand its business by including more sports betting and iGaming offerings to its platform.</p>
<p>As one of the best providers of gambling titles, Red Tiger Gaming is a perfect partner for ATG as the company seeks to diversify the experience of its users and engage them with more varied betting content.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Benefit Both Companies</p>
<p>Christian Erlandsson, a spokesperson for ATG, spoke about the deal, saying that he is convinced it will greatly benefit both parties. While Red Tiger Gaming will increase its footprint on the European market, ATG will be able to enhance its casino offerings and provide punters with more to choose from:</p>
<p>“Boosting our slots portfolio with content from an exciting studio like Red Tiger will provide players with added choice and enhance our overall casino experience.” ATG spokesperson Christian Erlandsson</p>
<p>James Jones, the head of business development for Evolution Gaming, Red Tiger Gaming’s ownership company, pointed out that the provider already has a presence in the Nordics and its games have proven popular among the local bettors. Jones is delighted to expand the company’s reach and has no doubts that ATG’s players will enjoy the new content.</p>
<p>Red Tiger is one of the best in its craft. Its proprietary iGaming titles have been highly sought by numerous gambling operators. A few days ago, the provider inked a partnership with MrQ, agreeing to launch iGaming titles on its platform. In January, Red Tiger signed another deal with the iGaming solutions provider Gamingtec.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming Group has been steadily increasing its revenue and influence thanks to its strategic deals and the success of its subsidiaries.</p>
