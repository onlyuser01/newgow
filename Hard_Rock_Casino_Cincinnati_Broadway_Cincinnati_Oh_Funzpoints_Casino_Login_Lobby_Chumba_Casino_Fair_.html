<p>Facilitated by Microgaming, seven Lightning Box games will now appear on Kindred Group-owned 32Red Casino.</p>
<p>Lightning Box Games to Appear on 32Red Casino</p>
<p>32Red Casino has expanded its portfolio of award-winning games with player-favorite products by Lightning Box, the Australian iGaming developer, and supplier. The integration was facilitated thanks to a Microgaming’s aggregation deal.</p>
<p>As a result, 32Red players will have access to several select titles, including Golden Yak, Silver Lioness4x, and others.</p>
<p>Lightning Box CEO and co-founder Peter Causley has welcomed the move, stressing how important it was for the company to establish a partnership with one of the industry’s best-known brands.</p>
<p>“Our aggregation deal with Microgaming has reaped the rewards in the last few years and no more so than with this latest deal with 32Red,” added. Now, Causley and his team are looking forward to the only thing that matters – player reception.</p>
<p>32Red has an extensive player base which means that Lightning Box’s titles will have plenty of exposure and organic traffic to benefit from.</p>
<p>Microgaming head of aggregation Graeme Powrie praised the studio for its proven quality in developing good content and added that Microgaming was delighted to have facilitated the integration.</p>
<p>A Clear Focus on the United States</p>
<p>Lightning Box has been able to establish a footprint in various markets across the world. Earlier this week, the company gained entry into Michigan through a localized partnership with Churchill Down’s TwinSpires.</p>
<p>As a result, players can enjoy a number of highly popular slot games, including but not limited to Lightning Horseman, Lightning Leopard, and Chicken Fox.</p>
<p>Lightning Box has been on an expansion trajectory in the United States since at least 2020. The company struck a deal with Scientific Games and the company’s OpenGaming platform last year, allowing Lightning to appear in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In August 2020, Lightning Box inked another partnership with Konami, allowing the developer’s titles to appear in brick-and-mortar casinos across the country.</p>
