<p>Dear Vicente,</p>
<p>We are very sorry about your negative experience with Dexterbet. First, I want to apologise for the situation that happens.</p>
<p>From what I can see in our system, you have never sent us an email that you are Gambling Addicted. (if you have, please share with us) Also, I want to inform you that if you don't want to send us an email, there is another option on our website where you can close your account permanently by yourself (Self-Exclusion Policy), but when players request that from us by email, we close their account with no possibility to reopen.</p>
<p>Please read our Terms and Condition.</p>
<p>Closing your Account</p>
<p>You are entitled to close your account at any time by sending an email to or doing so in My Profile. We will endeavour to respond within a reasonable time. You are responsible for all activity on your account until such closure has been acknowledged and affected by us.</p>
<p>Our system cannot be automatic regarding your duplicate accounts. Everything is manual, and when we notice that you have multiplay accounts, we are going to close or block them; please read our Terms and Condition:</p>
<p>It is the players' responsibility to read our terms and conditions.</p>
<p>You are allowed to have only one account. If you attempt to open more than one account, all your accounts may be blocked or closed. You are not allowed to sell, transfer or acquire an account with us from any other user. We reserve the right to close any accounts traced to the same address, IP address or computer or suspected of having been transferred between users and freeze any winnings on those accounts. If we have deposited any bonuses, winnings or other funds into a duplicate account, we reserve the right to remove such funds.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hey Veronika,</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions, please feel free to ask me.</p>
