<p>Permanent Self Exclusion not honored, Rollbit won't take accountability for their mistake even though it would have never happened unless they ignored a request.</p>
<p>On ~1st august 2021 I requested a self-exclusion which would be permanent under the note to never unban my account. The representative agreed to my request and self-excluded my account with noted as permanently and not to be unbanned. Yet just some week later I was able to have my account ready for gambling, since then I've been losing well over 50,000. I Contacted rollbit through email to have the situation rectified as this should have never happened and if they followed a simple exclusion with a literal note themselves added to be permanent everything would have been good.</p>
<p>In the email, I received this response</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Good day there,</p>
<p>You asked for your account to be re-enabled. We re-enable accounts when requested, except for users with gambling problems. We're afraid we won't be able to assist you with this."</p>
<p>The problem with this is that their ToS clearly states this!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>In case You are diagnosed with a gambling addiction or try to stay away from gambling for a different reason, we want to assist you to stay away from anything, that does nothing good for you. "Self-Exclusion" means, that You exclude yourself, out of Your own choice, from all gambling services. This exclusion cannot be undone for a set amount of time. If you wish to self-exclude yourself from gambling, please message our support and give them a time span of 6 months and 5 years. They also will explain all future steps and what we need from you.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that Self Exclusion is permanent for the set time span and will not be undone for your own protection.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Proving that what they are saying is not accurate and should be rectified as they undid a protection that I had to prevent me from gambling for their own benefit.</p>
