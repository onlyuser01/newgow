<p>The 2023 Indianapolis 500 race is on the program on Sunday, May 28, and same as any other Indy 500 event, this one too is bound to be super-exciting</p>
<p>Sunday, May 28, 2023, is going to be a fantastic day for racing fans with three major races on the program. We‚Äôve already covered two of them ‚Äì NASCAR Coca-Cola 600 and Formula 1 Monaco GP ‚Äì and now is the time to preview the 2023 Indianapolis 500.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis 500 is one of the most prestigious events in the motorsports universe, and every driver dreams of passing the ‚Äúbrickyard‚Äù at the finish line before everyone else. Last season, it was Marcus Ericsson who did it, but in 2023, online bookmakers suspect we might get a new champion. Alex Palou, Pato O‚ÄôWard, and Scott Dixon are the top three favorites, each with the 2023 Indy 500 odds of under +1000.</p>

<p>Alex Palou‚Äôs 2023 Indy 500 Odds Likely to Shorten by Sunday</p>
<p>Those bettors who plan to back Alex Palou to win the 2023 Indy 2023 should do it as soon as possible. It‚Äôs because we‚Äôre certain his odds are going to shorten in the next couple of days. The main reason for that is that the 26-year-old Spaniard is an experienced driver who‚Äôs already won major races in his professional career, especially during his IndyCar Series-winning season two years ago.</p>
<p>Palou is yet to win the Indy 500 race, but this could be his year. The thing is that last week, he got himself the pole position in Sunday‚Äôs race, starting from the first position in the inside section of the grid.</p>

<p>He‚Äôll be right in front of Santino Ferrucci and Alexander Rossi, neither of whom is seen as a serious contender for the No. 1 place on the podium.</p>
<p>Palou‚Äôs biggest rival ‚Äì in the eyes of the bookies ‚Äì Pato O‚ÄôWard will start the 2023 Indy 500 race from the second position in the middle section of the starting grid. Scott Dixon, who‚Äôs the third favorite, will start the race in the second position of the outside column.</p>
<p>Will Power Mustn‚Äôt Be Underestimated</p>
<p>The Australian driver is the reigning champion of the IndyCar Series, who won only one race last season. So, how did he manage to triumph in the end? He performed well constantly throughout the season, always finishing in a respectable position.</p>
<p>In last year‚Äôs Indy 500, he finished 15th, which was one of his three worst results of 2022. This year, he‚Äôs likely to do much better. He got himself the fourth position in the outside grid, which isn‚Äôt great, but this guy seems to love to have a late start.</p>
<p>This season, we saw him jump from outside into the top 10 in three races ‚Äì Texas, Long Beach, and Alabama. Although we don‚Äôt think he can win this race, Power can definitely break into the top 10, and maybe even end up on the podium.</p>
<p>2023 Indy 500 Prediction</p>
<p>Not only did Alex Palou win the pole position for the 2023 Indy 500, but he did it with the qualifying speed of 234.217 miles per hour, thus breaking the record for the fastest pole speed at the Brickyard. This performance has certainly given him a morale boost, which is exactly what he needed ahead of the biggest race of the 2023 season.</p>
<p>Pick: Alex Palou to win the 2023 Indy 500</p>
