<p>1×2 Network, an award-winning online gaming content provider and aggregator platform, has extended its reach in the Dutch iGaming market. The company has teamed up with BetCity.nl, a prominent brand in the Netherlands, which will now benefit from 1×2 Network’s extensive range of games and titles.</p>
<p>1×2 Network Introduces Content to BetCity.nl</p>
<p>BetCity.nl will add a range of titles, including arcade, instant win games, slots, and table titles, all provided by 1×2 Network and its development arm, 1x2gaming and Iron Dog Studios, along with other titles. Some of the prominent games to be featured on BetCity.nl moving forward, include Gods of Asgard Megaways, Wolf Strike Hold and Win and Solar Nova, to name a few.</p>
<p>Presently, BetCity has a 20% market share in the Netherlands, but the brand is determined to continue expanding its reach. Commenting on this new opportunity, 1×2 Network’s Rory Kimber said that the Netherlands is a crucial market and there has been a rapid expansion of operator activities over the past 12 months. BetCity has certainly been a key part of this growth. Kimber added:</p>
<p>We’re delighted to partner with one of the major players in the Dutch gaming space. 1×2 Network Rory Kimber</p>
<p>BetCity’s Melvin Bostelaar also welcomed the partnership with 1×2 Network and confirmed that the brand was delighted to team up. He praised both 1×2 gaming and Iron Dog Studios and said that both developers have been reputed and esteemed in the iGaming community, and that the addition of their titles will further help BetCity.nl expand its reach.</p>
<p>“We look forward to growing together in this vibrant new market,” Bostelaar concluded. Previously, 1×2 Network teamed up with ComeOn to introduce special branded games. As to BetCity, the company has been working hard to secure more content partnerships that enable it to stand tall in the competitive Dutch market. BetCity.nl signed a similar partnership with Stakelogic Live to add an array of excellent Live Casino titles to its content offering.</p>
