<p>Parsec plans to acquire the rest of the Enteractive Media shares in the future and apply for a Nasdaq listing</p>
<p>Parsec Capital Acquisitions, a special purpose acquisition company, has acquired a majority interest in Enteractive Media, a gaming affiliate company. Parsec Capital said that it plans to acquire the remaining Enteractive shares in the future, turning the company into a wholly-owned subsidiary.</p>
<p>The current deal follows a previous merger announcement and overrides the actual merger between Parsec and Enteractive. Following the current acquisition, Parsec is expected to change its name to GameChangerz Media.</p>
<p>The rebranded firm will apply for a Nasdaq listing in the near future. As announced by the two companies, the newly-formed entity will be “the parent company to a variety of innovative, industry-leading businesses and platforms supporting the gaming, gambling, and entertainment industries.”</p>
<p>Parsec Capital Changes Team Following the Acquisition</p>
<p>Parsec Capital reshuffled its team following the acquisition. A few directors, namely Alec Burger, Daniel Elwell, Edmund Moy, Patricia Trompeter and William Readdy, resigned from their positions. The company then welcomed Kelly Kellner and Terry Debono as directors. Paul Haber, meanwhile, will continue serving as the company’s chief financial officer and director.</p>
<p>In addition to his role as a director, Kellner was named as Parsec’s new chief executive officer. He addressed the completion of the recent acquisition, saying that his team is now prepared to proceed with its plans to create a disruptive new gaming company.</p>
<p>The completion of the acquisition means we are now ready to move forward with our vision of creating a game-changing media and gaming company that will create shareholder value through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Kelly Kellner, CEO, Parsec Capital Acquisitions</p>
<p>Parsec promised to provide further updates when it forms its international corporate strategy, management team and plans. The company will also release an announcement when it has more news about the timeline of its planned Nasdaq market listing.</p>
<p>Enteractive is a media company that focuses on the iGaming and sports betting sectors. The company leverages multiple platforms to engage countless viewers, which helps it monetize its super affiliate business model.</p>
<p>GameChangerz Media has existing agreements with some of the biggest and most influential suppliers within the industry. These include major companies, such as 888 Poker, Sportradar, Americas Cardroom, Active International, Boom Gaming, Betcris and Chaos Integrated, among others.</p>
