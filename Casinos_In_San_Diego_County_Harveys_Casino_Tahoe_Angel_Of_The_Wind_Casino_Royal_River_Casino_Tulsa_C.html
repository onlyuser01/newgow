<p>Spain vs. England is the final of the 2023 World Cup. Neither “La Roja” nor “The Lionesses” have ever won this competition, meaning that we’ll get a brand-new champion on Sunday, August 20</p>
<p>Betting odds suggest the Spain women’s national football team will win the trophy on Sunday at Stadium Australia in Sydney, but England mustn’t be underestimated. It’s because “The Lionesses” have been really impressive since coming to Australia.</p>
<p>In fact, their results are more impressive than those of the Spanish ladies, but it perhaps has something to do with the fact that “La Roja” has played against some really tough opponents.</p>
<p>Spain vs. England Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Spain +170 Draw +200 England +188</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 2.5 +150 Under 2.5 -200</p>

<p>: Sunday, August 20, 2023 Time : 6:00 AM ET</p>

<p>Spain Ready for Another Big Game</p>
<p>Spain finished second in Group C, with a 2-0-1 record. “La Roja” defeated Costa Rica (3-0) and Zambia (5-0) in the first two games, but then got hammered 4-0 by Japan in the final game of the group phase. What’s interesting about that game is that the Spanish ladies were the ones to have the ball in their possession for almost four-fifths of the time.</p>
<p>Despite controlling the game, they just weren’t able to find the net. But they did find the net in each of the following games. In fact, “La Roya” scored a total of eight goals in the three games of the playoffs. The reason why this is so impressive is that Spain played against three really tough opponents – Switzerland, Netherlands, and Sweden.</p>
<p>Real Madrid’s midfielder Teresa Abelleira was brilliant in each of those games. In fact, she’s been Spain’s standout player in this tournament. Her colleague from the center of the field, Aitana Bonmati, had one brilliant game (vs. Switzerland) but hasn’t done much since.</p>
<p>It’s a similar case with striker Jenifer Hermoso who was amazing in the group stage, but since, she hasn’t scored much. In fact, she scored just one goal in the three games of the knockout phase.</p>
<p>Can England Upset the Odds?</p>
<p>Spain is all about Teresa Abelleira in this tournament, while England has been playing more as a collective. The result of this is that “The Lionesses” have been very dominant in almost every single game of the tournament.</p>
<p>They went 3-0-0 in the group stage, getting a score difference of 8-1. Then, in the first game of the playoffs, they struggled against Nigeria but still managed to win on penalties after 0-0 in regulation. In the quarterfinal, they beat Colombia, once again putting on a superb defensive performance. It was 2-1 in the end, but the Colombian women made significantly more goal chances than them.</p>

<p>Finally, in their most recent game, “The Lionesses” defeated “the Matildas.” Australia had the home crowd on its side, but that did not upset England. Instead, the English girls went on and won the game 3-1 with three different players getting on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Spain vs. England Prediction</p>
<p>Spain is fantastic in the midfield thanks to Teresa Abelleira, but this team’s offense just isn’t too lethal. Sure, there are some good attackers on the roster of “La Roya” with Jenifer Hermoso being the best example. However, we don’t think they’re good enough to outsmart England’s defenders.</p>
<p>“The Lionesses” have been brilliant in all aspects of the game, but it’s their defense that’s often overlooked. However, defenders like Millie Bright and Alex Greenwood are the kind of players who can win big matches such as the 2023 Women’s World Cup Final. If they stop Spain from scoring too many times, England is going to win.</p>
<p>Picks: England to win and under 2.5 goals</p>
