<p>The company announced the landmark partnership which allows it to further expand its reach in the Latin American market and establish itself in a confident manner in one of the biggest-to-be iGaming regions.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play continues to Grow in Latin America with Aposta Ganha</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s dominance in the Latin American market has been distinguishable with the supplier looking to deliver both its live casino and slot products to various operators, and most recently, Aposta Ganha. The operator’s CEO, Ramon Lima, welcomed this partnership and said that Pragmatic Play enjoyed worldwide popularity.</p>
<p>The accolades won by the company were “a testimony” to the company’s content and what it brought to the table. Lima also spoke about Aposta Ganha’s own market presence and strength in Brazil:</p>
<p>Aposta Ganha has become synonymous with providing high-quality entertainment experiences and Pragmatic Play strongly aligns with this key aspect of our growth strategy. Aposta Ganha CEO Ramon Lima</p>
<p>Aposta Ganha will have access to a number of slot games that are some of the players’ favorite choices all over the world, including Pizza! Pizza? Pizza! and Hot Pepper. Other popular slot games include Sugar Rush and Gates of Olympus.</p>
<p>As to the live casino games available, Pragmatic Play will provide players with a list of its traditional and gameshow-inspired titles, to wit blackjack and roulette, Boom City, Sweet Bonanza, and CandyLand. The launch is clearly another important step for Pragmatic Play in the still-developing market which the supplier appreciates and seeks to expand rapidly into.</p>
<p>Pragmatic is keen to increase its commercial growth in the market by securing linkups with prominent and trustworthy operators in Brazil, but also elsewhere in the region. The past months have been busy for Pragmatic. The partnership was similarly welcomed by Pragmatic Play VP of LatAm Victor Arias who said that going live with Aposta Ganha was an important stepping-stone for the supplier to further expand its reach in the market.</p>
<p>The operator has a track record and core set of values that “strongly aligns” with Pragmatic’s own growth strategy, Arias added. He further said that the company was very happy to see a push with both product lines at the same time.</p>
<p>“Going live with Aposta Ganha aids us in this mission via its strong market position and we look forward to seeing player’s reception to the delivery of two of our most beloved verticals simultaneously,” Arias wrapped up.</p>
