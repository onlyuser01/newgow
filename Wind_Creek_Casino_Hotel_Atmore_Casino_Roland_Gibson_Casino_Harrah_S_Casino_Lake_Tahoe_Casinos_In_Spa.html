<p>The prominent operator and provider of gaming products have teamed up to create a new dedicated fantasy experience</p>

<p>The free-to-play game has been designed to engage with sports fans and offer them a chance to quickly participate in alternative contests and boost player satisfaction. Every eligible bet365 customer may partake in the new game.</p>
<p>Each customer is allowed to rejuggle their team as they see fit until the first game of the season, that between Manchester City and Burnley, which kicks off on Friday, August 11. Apart from playing for free, players will have the chance to win a real money prize. A total of £500,000 will be divvied up between the first 10,000 ranking users and a guaranteed £50,000 will go to the first-place finisher.</p>
<p>This new contest will run independently from another £65,000 monthly prize that will be distributed between the 1,000 ranking players. Bet365 and Scout Gaming Group are confident in the success of their newly-pitched product.</p>
<p>Bet365 has welcomed the arrival of the new game, with a spokesperson saying that the brand was very happy to have this multi-country fantasy product up and running ahead of one of the most important soccer events of the year. The spokesperson added:</p>
<p>We’re excited to see how the season develops and which managers can land the monthly and outright cash prizes. Bet365 spokesperson</p>
<p>Strong Uptake for Bet365’s New Fantasy Game</p>
