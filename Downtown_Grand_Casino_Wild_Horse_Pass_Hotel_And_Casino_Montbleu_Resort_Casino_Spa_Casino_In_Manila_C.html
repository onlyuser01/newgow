<p>Pariplay is preparing to expand in Latin America and Brazil in particular through an alliance with a prominent operator in the region</p>
<p>The operator in question, Eyas Gaming, is a respected name in Germany with a strong presence in global markets. The company is also backed by Gauselmann Group which puts it in a strong position to help Pariplay deploy its first and third-party content.</p>
<p>Eyas Gaming to Roll Out with Pariplay Games in LatAm</p>
<p>Brazil is hailed as a strategically important market for both companies which are keen to continue growing their global footprint with one of the largest markets in the world that is undergoing significant regulatory and industry changes as of right now.</p>
<p>Pariplay will use its Fusion aggregation platform to ensure that it puts forward its own original content as well as the content of third parties. This comes with a range of back-office conversation tools that will bring even greater value to players in the long run.</p>
<p>Among the original content that is brought on by Pariplay are games by Wizard Games, with more than 130 quality releases, including The Frog, Book of Eternal Romance, and not least, Princess Celina.</p>
<p>Pariplay is in a good position to continue growing in Latin America, as the company has received licenses in both Panama and Argentina and will be looking to continue gathering momentum in the sector. Pariplay VP of Sales Andrew Maclean welcomed the opportunity to be working with Eyas Gaming.</p>
<p>He described it as an important operator that showed plenty of potential and had many excellent plans charted out. In praising Eyas Gaming, Maclean added:</p>
<p>Their particular focus on Brazil and Latin America is important to us at Pariplay®, as we seek to expand and strengthen our foothold in the region. We look forward to a successful future working alongside Eyas Gaming. Pariplay VP of Sales Andrew Maclean</p>
<p>Eyas Gaming head of product Jack Anthony was similarly happy to see Pariplay bring its extensive portfolio of games with the provider. Thanks to this collaboration, Eyas Gaming will actually be venturing into the market with an outstanding selection of games that will give it a strong start in any market.</p>
<p>Their Fusion platform brings with it plenty of wonderful games from suppliers across the world, and with their Wizard Games portfolio to boot, we’re confident our players will embrace all that Pariplay has to offer,” Anthony concluded.</p>
