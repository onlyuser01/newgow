<p>Evolution Gaming will provide CBN and AGLC with a selection of live casino titles for their respective lottery operations</p>
<p>Evolution Enters Agreements With CBN and AGLC</p>
<p>Live casino operator Evolution Gaming Group has signed agreements with the Canadian Bank Note Company (CBN) and Alberta Gaming, Liquor &amp; Cannabis (AGLC) to provide both companies with live casino games for their lottery operations.</p>
<p>CBN is now offering Evolution’s online live casino games as part of its recent digital offering, which is subject to local legislation in each jurisdiction where it operates or supports lotteries. Lottery players will have access to a diverse range of online live games on their mobile, tablet, or laptop thanks to the Evolution-powered Live Casino.</p>
<p>CBN lottery countries will have access to Evolution’s complete portfolio of live games and can choose which ones to incorporate. Crazy Time, Mega Ball, and Lightning Roulette are only a few of the games available. In addition, CBN will have access to Evolution’s groundbreaking RNG-based First Person games.</p>
<p>CBN chief financial officer and president of lottery systems Craig Bascombe is confident in the agreement with Evolution. According to him, CBN feels sure that Evolution’s diverse range of online casino and entertainment games will prove popular with millions of lottery players.</p>
<p>CBN is a security printing company best known for supplying the Bank of Canada with banknotes since 1935. The firm has a wide range of other clients, including private businesses, national and sub-national governments, central banks and more.</p>
<p>AGLC to Launch Six Live Dealer Games By Evolution</p>
<p>In the meantime, AGLC will debut a total of six live dealer games by Evolution, which recently brought its live casino suite to Asia. This includes roulette, Infinite Blackjack, and Ultimate Texas Hold’em to name a few. The company will likely incorporate more Evolution live games over the coming months.</p>
<p>All six Evolution games are available on the AGLC’s PlayAlberta.ca website, which is a licensed online gambling platform that is accessible on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.</p>
<p>The new live casino offering sits alongside AGLC’s current collection of slots, instants, and virtual table games available via the NeoPollard Interactive-powered network. PlayAlberta.ca is only available to players over the legal age of 18 who are physically located within the province’s boundaries.</p>
<p>According to Evolution commercial director Jeff Millar, the launch of AGLC was yet another proud moment for the company as it rolls out its services across Canada. Millar affirmed Evolution’s commitment to quality and stressed that the live casino operator strives to deliver enhanced online gambling choice and entertainment for Alberta.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming Group’s stock price is currently trending up and sits at kr 1,160.00, an increase of 3.11%.</p>
