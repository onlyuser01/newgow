    <h1>Horshoe Casino Oklahoma Casino Map How Much Do Casino Dealers Make Rhythm City Casino Iowa Ameristar</h1>

<p>Dear Bellaxen2305,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked carefully the T&amp;Cs and this is what I found https://www.yebocasino.co.za/terms:</p>
<p>"As per the Casino’s terms of use, bonuses will only be provided to one household and/or one account. All game bonuses and winnings may be cancelled if the Casino determines that a second account has been opened. If such events occur, the account could be closed immediately."</p>
<p>There’s an important principle that says, "ignorance of the law is no excuse". It means that you can’t defend your actions by arguing you didn’t know they were illegal or forbidden, even if you honestly did not realize you were breaking the rules.</p>
<p>Please understand, that it is strictly forbidden, in the majority of the casinos, to have more than one account. As you admitted, you have opened two separate accounts. This has been recognized by the casino as breaching T&amp;Cs and your active balance was confiscated. Unfortunately, there is not much I can do for you in this case. I could recommend reading our article on Duplicate Accounts https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#duplicate-accounts.</p>
<p>If there is any additional info you would like to share with me, please do not hesitate to contact me, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
