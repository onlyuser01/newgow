<p>OpenGaming by Light &amp; Wonder will welcome a new content provider as part of the aggregation platform with boutique studio Bang Bang Games bolstering the portfolio’s offering. OpenGaming is a platform developed by Light &amp; Wonder that allows for the quick onboarding of select games that can be distributed through a network of partner operators interested in securing exciting products.</p>
<p>Bang Bang Games is a fairly new developer in the space and it has been focusing on building a distinguishable and memorable portfolio with titles such as Rainbow Power Potz UltraNudge, Super Cash Drop, Jokrz Wild UltraNudge, and others. The studio has already pioneered several unique features to help build differentiation and establish its own signature style.</p>
<p>Bang Bang Games focuses on simple but powerful gaming concepts that have excellent art and quality of the animations and core gameplay. Commenting on this collaboration, company CEO Frank McPolin welcomed the chance to see its products integrated with the OpenGaming platform, something that follows several years of collaboration between Bang Bang Gaming and Light &amp; Wonder already.</p>
<p>"The opportunity to bring a packed roadmap of brand-new exclusive games to the Playzido network is very exciting! We can’t wait to start distributing our awesome games to the wider audience base that Light &amp; Wonder brings us," McPolin said.</p>
<p>Bang Bang Games is also an important partner to the company, as it helps build OpenGaming’s reputation as an aggregator of the world’s most successful studios and top-performing games. Similarly, Bang Bang Games stands to benefit from Light &amp; Wonder’s ample reach of operators.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Digital Partnerships Director Steve Mayes was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that Bang Bang Games was a worthwhile addition that will significantly boost the platform’s offering and help establish its reach.</p>
<p>Bang Bang Games has also been looking to actively scale up its presence with different slot and gaming aggregators. EveryMatrix recently added the studio to its own SlotMatrix business-to-business aggregator solution. Light &amp; Wonder too has been looking to strengthen the variety of games and products it has to offer to partners by seeking out individual studios and onboarding them.</p>
