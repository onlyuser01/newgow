<p>Golden State Warriors, Led by ‘Assassin’ Kevin Durant, Take 3-0 NBA Finals Lead</p>

<p>If the Golden State Warriors don’t win their third NBA title in four years in the coming week, they’ll be on the wrong side of the biggest comeback in the history of American sports. Of course, the odds of an upset like that happening is about as strong as the Cleveland Browns winning the next Super Bowl.</p>

<p>After coming from behind Wednesday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers to take a 3-0 NBA Finals series lead, the Warriors are nearly assured of winning the Larry O’Brien Trophy. No team in NBA history has come back from a three-game playoffs deficit, and only three times has a series that was 3-0 gone seven games.</p>
<p>Combined with the fact that the Warriors and Cavs were severely mismatched from the get-go, and it’s rather safe to say that the 2018 NBA Finals are over.</p>
<p>Steph Green had an off night, but teammate Kevin Durant was there to pick him up. The superstar scored 43 points on 15-23 shooting, including 6-9 from behind the arc.</p>
<p>“He’s an assassin, and that was one of those assassin plays,” LeBron James said of Durant’s fourth-quarter dagger from 33-feet out that put Golden State ahead for good.</p>
<p>Game 4 is in Cleveland Friday night at 9 pm ET. Las Vegas sportsbooks have the Warriors spotting the Cavs 5.5 points.</p>
<p>Series Prices</p>
<p>Should the above information not have properly convinced one that the Cavs aren’t winning the NBA Finals this year, sportsbooks will gladly take that person’s money.</p>
<p>The series prices for the Cavs winning in seven games is now at 50/1. A $100 bet and that unlikeliest scenario nets $5,000.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sportsbooks have basically stopped taking money on Golden State. The series price is now 1/250 (+25000). A $100 bet and the Warriors winning as expected nets the gambler $0.40.</p>
<p>To win a $100 on the Warriors at the current price, you’ll need to wager $25,000.</p>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>With the 2017-18 NBA season all but over, oddsmakers are already looking to next year. And it should come as no surprise that the Golden State Warriors are the odds-on favorites once again.</p>
<p>The SuperBook has the champs at 6/5, or implied odds of 45.5 percent. The Houston Rockets, a team that took Golden State seven games in the Western Conference Finals, are next at 7/2.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia 76ers, a team that hopes to land James in the offseason, shares that 7/2 line. A healthy Kyrie Irving has the Boston Celtics at 7/1.</p>
<p>The favorites are followed by the San Antonio Spurs and presumed LeBron-less Cavs at 30/1.</p>
<p>Stephen A. Smith said on ESPN’s “First Take” this week that James will consider seven teams this summer. Along with the Cavs, which can offer him the most money, Smith expects the shortlist to include the 76ers, Celtics, Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers, and Warriors.</p>
