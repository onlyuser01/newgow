<p>Licensed venues across New South Wales will no longer be able to display gambling inducement messages outside of their venues. This comes as part of a new measure that the state has introduced and will expect all pubs and clubs to comply with come September 1, 2023. External signage of gambling would need to be either completely removed or concealed so that it’s not visible to passers-by.</p>
<p>The measure comes along with a ream of similar changes designed to ensure that NSW continues to tackle problem gambling, as poker machines – or pokies – are linked to the highest risk of irresponsible and pathological gambling. The issue has been part of recent political infighting and a passionate public debate.</p>
<p>Now, venues that host pokies would have three months to roll out the changes and make sure that they have their signage removed so that they do not breach the new regulations. Offenders will be fined $7,300 per offense, the NSW government stated.</p>
<p>Minister for Gaming and Racing, David Harris, was adamant that gambling harm-minimization is an important part of the government’s agenda moving forward, adding:</p>
<p>"The façades of pubs and clubs across the state are littered with signs such as "VIP lounge" to alert those walking or driving by that they have gaming machines. Some of these signs are extremely prominent, and can be seen by children and members of the community who are at risk of gambling harm."</p>
<p>Problem gambling has been a hot-button topic for many, as the rates of problem gamblers continue to climb as does the amount spent on pokies across the state’s clubs and pubs. In order to hold everyone to higher standards, the NSW is undertaking sweeping reforms, including the introduction of gambling cards to help keep track of gamblers’ spending habits and intervene should people spend above their means.</p>
<p>This measure has been criticized by some as undermining customer loyalty. Another recent matter has also made it so that pubs and clubs may not make political donations anymore, severing any lingering feeling that these establishments may be trying to influence gambling policy by volunteering money to political campaigns.</p>
<p>Harris added that the government was aware that pubs and clubs were using "VIP Lounges" to dodge current regulations that already prohibited gambling-related signage. However, that loophole is now coming to a stop, the minister assured. Meanwhile, a new research The Roy Morgan indicated that two-thirds of people playing pokies before 8 am are qualified as problem gamblers.</p>
