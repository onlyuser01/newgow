    <h1>Warm Springs Casino Casino Ballroom Nh Casino In Denver Wild Horse Pass Hotel Casino Casino Sunland</h1>

<p>Created account 29e, deposited 2k euros, won 6k euros.</p>
<p>They asked for verification of salary which was credited the same day.</p>
<p>immediately asked how long this takes, they answer 48h. No email on Tuesday so I contact live service, they say they will contact me the same evening, the same show every day until today Friday when I contacted them several times and ask why it is not treated, they answer the same thing that they will take take care of it today promises and declares, since now for the last time they announce that they have closed and that I have to wait until Monday at the earliest. Note that this is only a document that has not even received a yes or no, then the rest will probably be met and we are talking about a processing time of months, which is laughable.</p>
<p>I think this is a clear behavior from a casino that is only interested in having losing customers and not winning and that such behavior should be shown and warned to the public.</p>
