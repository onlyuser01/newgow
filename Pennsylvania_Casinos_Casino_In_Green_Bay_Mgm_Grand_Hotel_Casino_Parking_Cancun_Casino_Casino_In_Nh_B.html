<p>Supplier of innovative casino content, Booming Games, will deploy its fun and engaging slot games with a range of Kindred Group’s online casinos. This will immediately improve and boost the content variety of numerous established brands, such as Unibet, Maria Casino and Bingo.com, which are available in Malta, Belgium, and the United Kingdom, and are some of the most prominent operators in their jurisdictions, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>As such, Kindred Group has been determined to significantly expand its content library and is now adding such choices as TNT Bonanza, Buffalo Hold and Win, Treasure Vault, Mighty Gorilla, Flaming Chillies, and Burning Classics Go Wild among many other titles.</p>
<p>Apart from the launch in the three aforementioned jurisdictions, Kindred and Booming have already negotiated a similar rollout in Sweden and the Netherlands, with Eastern European markets to follow after that in the coming months. The two companies feel confident that they stand to benefit from their work and partnership by offering players games that are packed with great features and diverse gameplay.</p>
<p>Booming Games has consistently delivered fun and exciting games that will now contribute to Kindred Group’s own standing in various markets. Booming Games Chief Commercial officer FrederikNiehusen welcomed the opportunity to be collaborating with Kindred Group and the Group’s outstanding brands.</p>
<p>"Our broad portfolio of slots, covering different formats and themes, and with different mechanics, RTPs, and volatilities, means there really is a game for every player and that is why we have become such an in-demand studio in recent months," Niehusen said, explaining the benefits that Kindred Group stood to gain from partnering with the supplier.</p>
<p>Kindred Group Head of RNG Casino Gareth Jennings was similarly excited about this opportunity and said that Booming Games was indeed a supplier that brought around outstanding games and slots. Players will appreciate the influx of highly thematic and innovative titles that are now coming to the Group’s casinos because of this tie-up, and the future product offerings that this collaboration will lead to.</p>
<p>Booming Games recently extended its reach in the iGaming sector by onboarding with REEVO, an aggregator of iGaming content. The company continues to grow its presence in various markets, with this Kindred Group partnership set to considerably expand its reach.</p>
