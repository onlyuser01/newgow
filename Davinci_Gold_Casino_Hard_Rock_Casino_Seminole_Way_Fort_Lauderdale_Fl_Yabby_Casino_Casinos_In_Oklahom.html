    <h1>Davinci Gold Casino Hard Rock Casino Seminole Way Fort Lauderdale Fl Yabby Casino Casinos In Oklahom</h1>

<p>Legzo Casino does not deserve 8 points out of 10,</p>
<p>Perhaps for a short time it was reliable, to obtain good points and Customers,</p>
<p>But they are using several scams:</p>
<p>1- More serious, deposit is being processed and does not reach the Casino account (they are probably diverting it to another account belonging to a Casino employee?)</p>
<p>2- email proving successful Deposit does not exist at Legzo Casino,</p>
<p>3-72-hour bonus and/or cashback last as long as they want, they can be removed within 2 hours after the notice,</p>
<p>4- Mix deposits with bonuses and cashback and withdraw your money from your account</p>
<p>Claiming bonus expiration or cashback</p>
<p>In fact, your cashback or bonus is still waiting to be approved for use,</p>
<p>-The Casino thief or thieves make you lose your deposited account money</p>
<p>And their bonuses, cashback (the amount in the account they put equal value to the bonus or cashback to make the person even more confused,</p>
<p>Something like psychopaths,</p>
<p>Careful.</p>
<p>I have taken several screenshots in the last few months</p>
<p>I'm looking for a lawyer, loss due to theft was high,</p>
<p>I have several Screenshots.</p>
<p>In Chat, I only make mistakes,</p>
<p>They purposely stay a long time without responding,</p>
<p>And when they respond, they see that they respond with nothing,</p>
<p>Ask a question and send the answer far from the question asked, example: I said I wanted proof of deposits made on my behalf within a period of 3 days,</p>
<p>Casino Response: Can I send withdrawal</p>
<p>The little loot that was made can send</p>
<p>But Deposits don't respond correctly...</p>
<p>Very careful</p>
<p>A Casino that makes a deposit or other winnings into your account,</p>
<p>He can be even more deceitful and thief than othersâ€¦</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and again be careful!!!</p>
