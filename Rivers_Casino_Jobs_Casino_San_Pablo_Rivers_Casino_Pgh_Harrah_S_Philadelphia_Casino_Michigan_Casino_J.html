<p>The globally-recognized sports betting and gaming company, Flutter Entertainment, announced a change to its senior-level team. The company revealed on Friday that John Bryant, a seasoned executive with more than 30 years of experience, was officially appointed to the role of Chair of the Flutter Board, as well as Chair of the Nomination Committee.</p>
<p>Judging by a statement released by Flutter Entertainment, Bryant's appointment was effective as of September 1, 2023. The recent change to the C-suite comes during an important moment for the company as it aims for further expansion on growth on a global scale. Stepping into the aforementioned role, Bryant takes over the responsibilities from Gary McGann. According to Flutter, McGann stepped down from his position with the Board effective from August 31, 2023.</p>
<p>For the last 30 years, Bryant has held numerous leadership roles and participated on the boards of multiple companies. His extensive career includes a two-decade tenure with the leading producer of cereal and leader in snacks production, Kellogg Company. He first joined the company back in 1998 and retired as Executive Chairman and CEO two decades later, in 2018.</p>
<p>Bryant's extensive experience includes an Advisor role with Godiva Chocolatier, as well as a Board Member role with Macy's. Throughout his extensive career, he held different roles with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC, as well as A.T. Kearney, among other companies. Currently, Bryant holds an MBA in Finance and Strategy from The Wharton School and an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from The Australian National University.</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Bryant said: "I would like to thank Gary for his excellent stewardship of the Flutter Board during his tenure as Chair and previously as Non-Executive Director." Finally, he pointed out: "His expertise, professionalism and commitment are greatly appreciated and on behalf of the Board, I wish Gary well in the future."</p>
<p>The news about the senior-level change comes after early last month, Flutter released its interim results for the first half of 2023. Figures released by the company unveiled important details regarding its performance for the six months ended June 30, 2023, pointing to a strong growth of group revenue to £4.8bn ($6.06bn), up by 42% year-over-year. Similarly, group EBITDA for H1 2023 hit £765m ($965.8m). This result, when compared to the £434m ($547.9m) result from H1 2022, showed an increase of 76%. At the time of the announcement, Flutter revealed that the growth was driven by positive momentum and an increase in average monthly players of 28%.</p>
