    <h1>Doubleu Casino Free Chips Facebook Casino Near Niagara Falls Casino Castle No Deposit Bonus Santa Ba</h1>

<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>Sorry for the late response.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at the time of the client's inquiry, our duplicate level detecting system was not fully functional. Now we can confidently say that client has registered two accounts in our system, and for both accounts, he used the same payment method. This type of behavior is defined as an attempt to cheat the casino.</p>
<p>As for the withdrawal limits that the client has mentioned - we can change the limits once a month, as stated in our rules.</p>
<p>8.16 Withdrawal limits set on customers' account may be changed at the discretion of the administration, not more than once a month. This also includes reducing previously arranged withdrawal limits.</p>
<p>Also, we have the right to set limits at the discretion of the casino administration:</p>
<p>8.13 The Casino administration reserves the right to make payments according to an individual schedule, set the minimum and maximum amount per one transaction, and the time for this transaction, which may differ depending on the method of withdrawal, your account level or other relevant factors.</p>
<p>When we suspected that the client was cheating, we contacted the platform to confirm this fact. Unfortunately, it took some time. But at the moment, we are absolutely sure that the client has a second account. Accordingly, all his payments were received as a result of our technical error (we could not find a second account).</p>
<p>At the moment, the client has received withdraws for: NOK 726,113.</p>
<p>And made deposits for: NOK 197,200 + NOK 77,930.</p>
<p>According to Rule 20.6: the customer must return the amount paid to him by mistake (not including commissions), that is: NOK 450,983.</p>
<p>20.6 Where You have used monies which have been credited to Your Account or awarded to You as a result of an Error to place subsequent bets or play games, we may cancel such bets and/or withhold any winnings which You may have won with such monies, and if we have paid out on any such bets or gaming activities, such amounts shall be deemed to be held by You on trust for us, and You shall immediately repay to us any such amounts when a demand for repayment is made by us to You.</p>
<p>We expect this amount to be returned to us - otherwise, we will contact the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>Paragraphs from our Terms and Conditions that customer has violated:</p>
<p>4.5 Your Account must be registered in Your own, correct, name and personal details and it shall only be issued once for You and not duplicated through any other person, family, household, address (postal or IP), email address, Access Device or any environment where Access Devices are shared (e.g. schools, workplaces, public libraries etc) and/or account in respect of the Services. Any other accounts which You open with us, or which are beneficially owned by You in relation to the Services shall be "Duplicate Accounts ". We may close any Duplicate Account (but shall not be obliged to do so). If we close a Duplicate Account:</p>
<p>4.5.1 all bonuses, free bets and winnings accrued from such bonuses and free bets obtained using that Duplicate Account will be void and forfeited by You;</p>
<p>4.5.2 we may, at our entire discretion, void all winnings and refund all deposits (less amounts in respect of void winnings) made in respect of that Duplicate Account and, to the extent not recovered by us from the relevant Duplicate Account, any amounts to be refunded to us by You in respect of a Duplicate Account may be recovered by us directly from any other of Your Accounts (including any other Duplicate Account); or</p>
<p>4.5.3 we may, at our entire discretion, allow usage of the Duplicate Account to be deemed valid in which case all losses and stakes placed by or for You through the Duplicate Account shall be retained by us.</p>
<p>5.1 You warrant that:</p>
<p>5.1.1 the name and address You supply when opening Your Account are correct; and</p>
<p>5.1.2 You are the rightful owner of the money which You at any time deposit in Your Account.</p>
<p>5.1.3 By making a deposit you confirm that the payment method used for the deposit belongs to you only and cannot be used by anyone else.</p>
