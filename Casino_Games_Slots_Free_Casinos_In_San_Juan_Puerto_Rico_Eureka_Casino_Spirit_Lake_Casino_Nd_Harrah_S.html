    <h1>Casino Games Slots Free Casinos In San Juan Puerto Rico Eureka Casino Spirit Lake Casino Nd Harrah S</h1>

<p>I won a two part bonus with this site on the 8th of this month. I actually was up 2000 usd but when I tried to cash out they reduced it to 269 stating the max withdrawal was 1.5x the bonus plus my deposit which was 31 dollars . The site claims instant e wallet transactions which is obviously a lie . I’ve tried to live chat multiple times and finally when I got thru to someone I was told 5-7 days max .. on the 8th day I tried getting thru again and after multiple attempts I was able to get a response. This time the agent told me I didn’t win the bonus round which was why I didn’t get my payout . I said what? It shows as processing in my history and I know I completed the play thru as the site showed that I did and which is how I was able to request the withdraw in the first place . All of a sudden he retracted his statement and said "he didn’t get me " and that now he was able to find the transaction and that I actually DID complete the bonus and it was for the amount of 296 (which isn’t true because it shows as 269 in the transaction history) I asked him why he said I didn’t win and he kept dodging and eventually tried saying he thought he was talking to someone else even though he knew exactly what bonus I was referring to and told me at first he’d show me how it said I didn’t win. Etc .. he tells me that it’s policy that it takes 10-12 days before I get paid ... he said I got wrong info in regards to the 5-7 days etc. I told him I wanted to speak to a supervisor which he of course said wasn’t available to speak to at that time. He kept assuring me I’d get paid and that they always pay everyone which after I did some homework found out that was far from accurate and that they have done this many times globally . I have screen shots of the whole convo as well as the convo with the other rep and pics of the transaction showing as pending and of all my account info etc if you need it . I’d like something done as I won fair and square and followed the rules in every aspect . Thanks in advance .</p>
