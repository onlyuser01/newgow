<p>The new deal delivers EasySwipe games for BetFlag customers, helping the operator expand its offering in Italy</p>
<p>The provider of innovative games, ESA Gaming, announced a new partnership with the operator BetFlag. Details of the new deal emerged Tuesday and see the operator benefit from ESA Gaming’s non-traditional EasySwipe content. Thanks to the new partnership, the innovative games provider expands further the reach of its content.</p>
<p>But the deal brings benefits for BetFlag as well. Teaming up with ESA Gaming, the operator introduced sports-themed games such as Goal Mine, Basketball Mine, Goal Mine World Edition, as well as the company’s first crash-style game called Rocket Racers.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, ESA Gaming agreed to launch nine games for BetFlag customers in Italy. The unique games stand out with engaging experiences and help create cross-sell opportunities for operators “without cannibalization.”</p>
<p>Overall, ESA Gaming offers a portfolio of 15 HTML5 mobile-first games that enable sports bettors to easily tap into the action by swiping in and out of sessions. This process doesn’t disrupt the sports betting experience but at the same time, delivers quality games for the customers and increases player lifetime value.</p>
<p>BetFlag, Delighted to Team Up with ESA Gaming</p>
<p>Laviero Saganeiti, BetFlag’s business developer, explained that the high-quality games provided by ESA Gaming captured the company’s attention. He added that by joining forces with the innovative game developer, the company acknowledged that its offering delivers unique and engaging experiences. “In general, even the slots and the recent Rocket Racers crash game demonstrate that they are gems that will surely stand out in the lively competition of our industry,” said Saganeiti in conclusion.</p>
<p>“ESA Gaming immediately captured our attention with their side games, to the point where we started thinking about a new version of the front-end that could enhance their value even more.“ Laviero Saganeiti, business developer at BetFlag</p>
<p>Thomas Smallwood, ESA Gaming’s head of marketing, added that the company is excited to deliver its non-traditional content for BetFlag, another important operator within the regulated gambling market in Italy. He added that only recently, the company expanded its offering to a total of 15 games. Finally, Smallwood predicted that the company’s games will be well-received by BetFlag’s customers.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to bring our non-traditional offering to another major Italian operator and see a great partner in BetFlag.“ Thomas Smallwood, head of marketing at ESA Gaming</p>
<p>The new deal with BetFlag comes on the heels of the debut of EasySwipe games from ESA Gaming with NetBet. Last week, the company confirmed it joined forces with the Italian online casino, delivering its leading games and expanding its reach.</p>
