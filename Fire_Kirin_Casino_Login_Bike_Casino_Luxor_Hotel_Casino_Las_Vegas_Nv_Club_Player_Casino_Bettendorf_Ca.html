<p>The first of the two companies will operate gambling, while the other one will offer B2B products and services</p>
<p>Two more gaming companies have secured licenses in Romania. One is Soft2Bet, which will operate gambling in the country, while the other one is ELA Games, which will supply local operators with content.</p>
<p>A Major Milestone for Soft2Bet</p>
<p>Soft2Bet secured approval from the ONJN, Romania’s gambling regulator, and will now be able to organize and operate games of chance in the country. Thanks to this move, the company now has access to one of the fastest-growing gaming markets in the European Union.</p>
<p>The move was described as a significant milestone for the company, which is bullish on expanding globally across regulated markets.</p>
<p>David Yatom, Soft2Bet’s general counsel, described Romania as a “pivotal market” for establishing a strong foothold in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Acquiring a local Romanian operating license marks an important step in our strategic expansion, building upon Soft2Bet’s success in other European markets. Stay tuned for more exciting developments in the near future. David Yatom, general counsel, Soft2Bet</p>
<p>Prior to its launch in Romania, Soft2Bet secured a B2C license in Greece and a B2B license in Sweden.</p>
<p>Another Step in ELA Games’ Success Journey</p>
<p>In addition to providing Soft2Bet with a B2C license, the ONJN also provided ELA Games with a B2B license, allowing it to launch its product in the country and supply local operators with its games.</p>
<p>The company described this development as the “next step of evolution in its success journey,” saying that Romania offers significant opportunities for the company. The B2B launch marks the latest phase of ELA Games’ global expansion into regulated markets and will make its games available to passionate Romanian audiences.</p>
<p>The launch in Romania comes just after the company rolled out two exciting new games, namely Bandidos Cash and Detective Fortune, which will now be available to Romanian players.</p>
<p>Daniel Mitton, the company’s director of gaming and business development, said that he is very excited to see ELA Games’ content go live in Romania. He called the new license a “remarkable achievement” that was only made possible by the hard work, dedication and experience of ELA Games’ team.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to bring our high-quality games to more operators, reaching more players and showcasing what ELA Games is all about – delivering safe, fun, and engaging gaming experiences. Daniel Mitton, director of gaming and business development, ELA Games</p>
<p>Romania is a very attractive market to companies seeking to expand their presence in Eastern Europe. The market offers comprehensive and transparent regulations that have nurtured its growth and made it an appealing destination for many companies in the sector.</p>
<p>One of the latest companies to launch in the country is Hacksaw Gaming, which recently agreed to provide MaxBet with content.</p>
