    <h1>High Roller Casino Las Vegas News Casino Top 10 Casinos In Vegas Hollywood Casino Joliet New Casino</h1>

<p>I've played a couple of 5 times at your casino. I'm a Bitcoin depositor with the most recent deposits being earlier today.</p>
<p>My first deposit was for 28.00 dollars. Initiated through my Coin base Account, transferred, no problems, notified within a couple minutes funds available. Great !!!</p>
<p>Played it out, decided I'd give it another try, so back to Coin base,initiated yet a second transfer which I noticed did not post as did the first which prompt me to check the status via Coin base/Block chain.</p>
<p>Long story short, i discover i somehow managed to purchase bch rather than btc, transferred using btc address supplied within the cashier section of your site. How i did this God only knows, ???</p>
<p>I contact support, explain the situation, support tells me, we don't accept bch and to contact Coin base which I did and Coin base basically says, " You've lost your money" . I realize Sports and Casino utilize the services of a third party processor, who I would imagine is setup to receive all types of crypto ?</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the transfer is mined and now has some 32 confirmations which is one of those things that makes ya say Hmmm ??? I chalked this up to Oh Well, My Bad !!</p>
<p>I initiate another transfer, this time making sure not to repeat my earlier actions. Again, no problems. I initiated, Coin base Broadcast, Block chain, da da da.... In a couple minutes funds in account..</p>
<p>Now, my issue.. As i said, try one last time, initiate transfer 42.81 dollars. No notification funds are available in account ?? I wait..... I wait...... Contact support, run through everything start to finish, support says, each transfer is different, could take less time could take more.. I wait......</p>
<p>Now, I have 4 confirmations,, I wait ...... 6 confirmations . I wait..... 2 hours, I wait .....</p>
<p>By this time support isn't responding to my email, chat request ?? Notta nowhere.. and I wait .....</p>
<p>9 confirmations, 3 hours, no support, no funds and I ??? wait ??? Oh Hell No !!!!</p>
<p>You guys had ample time third party processor or not to build Rome.. Not only does the processor have my 27.00 dollar's but it appears my 42.00 dollars as</p>
<p>well..</p>
<p>Way i see this is very simple, kindly return my money and no hard feelings..</p>
<p>I'm certain there is a reasonable, logical, ethical, and lawful reason you guys haven't credited my account, now if you will be kind enough to share it with me ???</p>
