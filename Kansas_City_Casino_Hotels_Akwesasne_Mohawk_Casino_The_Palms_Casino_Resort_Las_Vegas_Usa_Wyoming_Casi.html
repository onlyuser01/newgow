    <h1>Kansas City Casino Hotels Akwesasne Mohawk Casino The Palms Casino Resort Las Vegas Usa Wyoming Casi</h1>

<p>Borgata Casino, located in Atlantic City, NJ, has been hit with four sets of forfeiture requests by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. The casino allowed individuals who did not provide adequate ID to gamble at the property on four occasions reviewed by the regulator.</p>
<p>Borgata Did Not Argue Against the Claims</p>
<p>The DGE issued a $76,557 fine to Borgata naming 452 individuals who had failed to produce adequate identification documents. Another twenty-one individuals were removed from the grand total after the DGE investigation. They stemmed from findings against the gambling facility by the regulator on June 24, June 25, and August 5, 2021. As the DGE reported, the casino did not argue against the charges.</p>
<p>On June 24, 2021, Borgata allowed a total of 125 individuals to gamble on its property even though they did not provide the casino with adequate ID, abandoned certain assets, or were prohibited from gambling. This resulted in a $28,624.79 issued by the DGE.</p>
<p>A similar case took place on June 25, 2021, when Borgata confiscated $35,793.30 from 113 individuals that did not provide the casino with adequate ID, abandoned certain assets, or were prohibited from gambling. As a result, Borgata will have to pay $20,543.05 because of this incident.</p>
<p>A second complaint by the DGE dating to June 25, 2021 (third overall) requested the forfeiture of $22,335.99 that Borgata took from 122 individuals that did not provide the casino with adequate ID, abandoned certain assets, or was prohibited from gambling.</p>
<p>Finally, the DGE filed the fourth complaint against Borgata casino on August 5, 2021, in which it sought out a $5,123.17 forfeiture, the equal amount that Borgata confiscated from 92 individuals that did not provide the casino with adequate ID, abandoned certain assets, or were prohibited from gambling.</p>
<p>Other decisions by the DGE concerning Borgata involved alcohol permits. It granted the casino permission for alcoholic beverage testing for an event called “Plant Powered Plates” that will take place on January 29, 2022. A separate permit was issued for alcoholic beverage testing for an event called “A Salute to Lionel Richie”, which took place at Old Homestead restaurant on January 14, 2022.</p>
<p>The DGE Issued Quite a Lot of Fines Recently</p>
<p>Borgata faced fines by the DGE for the same reasons back in November and December 2021. The November fine totaled $9,148.95 while the December fine totaled $13,072.51. In July, Borgata also faced a lawsuit by a pro poker player. Harrah’s was hit with an $11,843.81 fine in November for the same reasons as Borgata.</p>
<p>On January 6, Caesars Digital Sportsbook was issued a $1,000 civil penalty. As the DGE states, the sportsbook reopened an account even though a decision was made to close it “due to gambling problem.” The sportsbook also agreed to a $1,605 disgorgement, which is the amount that Caesars Digital won from the patron.</p>
<p>In December, William Hill (Ocean Casino Resort) was fined $10,000 for employing a ticket writer whose casino employee registration has been revoked. FanDuel was also fined $2,000 in November for offering an unlicensed event “approved as a casino game.”</p>
