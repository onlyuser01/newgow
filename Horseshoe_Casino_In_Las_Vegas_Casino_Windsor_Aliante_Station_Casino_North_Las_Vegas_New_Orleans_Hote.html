<p>Party Night review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Party Night takes you back in time to the height of disco with its Saturday Night Fever dance floor colour scheme and the combo of turntables and disco balls in the pool of symbols it uses.</p>
<p>It is a pretty stylish theme with an upbeat feel and lots of colour to it and is a great excuse to put on a dance mix on your iPod and really go to town.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are a delight. They manage to be high-quality and highly detailed while still clearly showing an understanding of the scale on which they will be displayed. All too often the detailed designs fail on the small boxes of a reel, but here they really shine.</p>
<p>Accompanying the visual design is a decent piece of disco music, though I would probably recommend turning that off to avoid being driven insane as it loops.</p>
<p>The rest of the sound design is solid, working with the animations to give you a real thrill when you win.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Party Night is a five reel slot, with three rows and any way pays system. This means that any sequence of the same symbol, so long as it runs from the leftmost reels to consecutive reels to its right, will count as being on a winline.</p>
<p>On a five by three slot like this, that makes for 243 ways to win.</p>
<p>To add a little spark there is a multiplier symbol and a free spin bonus (details below) which is more or less the standard amount of variation you should expect from a modern slot.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Unusually there is no Wild symbol in Party Nights.</p>
<p>Instead, there is a Multiplier symbol, which increases any win that round by a factor of two, and a Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol pays out 5 times your bet for three, 25 for four and 500 for five.</p>
<p>Additionally, three, four or five Scatters award you 7, 10 or 15 bonus spins. These free spins have the added bonus of all symbols now paying out from any position (similar to a Scatter symbol).</p>
<p>You can retrigger bonus spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game had not been made available by the publisher, this is a significant issue and a major red flag.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from £/$/€0.10 per spin up to £/$/€50.00 per spin. This is a somewhat low spread, but other sites may offer a wider range of options.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is Medium to High which we like in a slot as this aspect does work well with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is Medium to High which we like in a slot as this aspect does work well with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>However, given the lack of a published RTP, we cannot recommend this slot.</p>
