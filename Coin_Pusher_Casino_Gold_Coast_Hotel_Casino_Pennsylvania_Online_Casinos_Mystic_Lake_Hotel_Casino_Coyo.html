    <h1>Coin Pusher Casino Gold Coast Hotel Casino Pennsylvania Online Casinos Mystic Lake Hotel Casino Coyo</h1>

<p>I was playing vivo live casino BJ at Olympus bet. I was playing two hands. One was for $200 and the other was for $100. Before round 1697402066870 I got an error message saying that not all my bets were accepted (I forget the exact phrasing). My $200 bet was rejected but my $100 bet was accepted, which I won. I took a screenshot of this hand, showing that I won and only one place had bets.</p>
<p>I also have a screenshot of the history of the hand before showing my balance was $700.</p>
<p>When I tried to take a pic of the history of the round where my bets were rejected I get an error.</p>
<p>Olympus bet has there own bet id's that are different from vivo, but the bet starting in 4808 is the same hand as round 1697402066870. And you can see in the history it shows I bet $300 and lost $100, because they are saying I lost my $200 bet that was rejected.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
