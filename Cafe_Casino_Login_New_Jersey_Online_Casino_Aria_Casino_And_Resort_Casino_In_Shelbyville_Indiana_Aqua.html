    <h1>Cafe Casino Login New Jersey Online Casino Aria Casino And Resort Casino In Shelbyville Indiana Aqua</h1>

<p>Dear Tomas and unabletoeattherice,</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this case to our attention!</p>
<p>We have reviewed the case and the Player's gaming activity with our relevant department and would like to confirm that a gameplay activity in conflict with the Bonus Terms and Conditions was found.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Player claimed DBETWEL125 bonus (amount of 25€). While in the bonus campaign, unabletoeattherice played mainly slot games, including the mentioned game - Fishin Frenzy Prize Lines. The bets made by the player, while in the bonus campaign were from 0.10€ to 3.01€.</p>
<p>According to the Terms and Conditions of the bonus, there's a restricted gameplay point that states "Placing bets of amounts higher than €12 (or equivalent to € in other currency) or 5% of the given bonus, whichever is lower".</p>
<p>In this case, considering that the bonus received was 25€, the player's bet stakes should not exceed 1.25€. As you can see above, and as the Player already confirmed, they have placed bets with a higher stake due to a possibility in a game that allows you to increase your chance to win by raising your bet stake.</p>
<p>Due to the breach of the Bonus Terms and Conditions, all winnings acquired by the Player while in the bonus campaign were voided, and all of this information was already provided and explained to the Player by our Customer Support Service.</p>
<p>Please note that due to the ongoing investigation of this case, Player's gaming account was closed, just to make sure that no misunderstandings or inaccuracies will take place. Currently, their account is fully active and available.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that only the winnings from the bonus were voided, and the deposited funds used for activating the bonus campaign were returned to the Player's gaming account. On a later date, the Player successfully withdrew the available balance.</p>
<p>We hope that this will further clarify the issue.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Dachbet Casino Team</p>
