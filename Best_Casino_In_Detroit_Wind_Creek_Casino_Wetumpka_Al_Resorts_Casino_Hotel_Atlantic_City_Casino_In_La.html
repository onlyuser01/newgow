    <h1>Best Casino In Detroit Wind Creek Casino Wetumpka Al Resorts Casino Hotel Atlantic City Casino In La</h1>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>this time it's about the payout at vegas2web, which I haven't seen in this form before. After I had been constantly submitting new documents for verification for over a week (a total of 4 credit cards with front and back, etc.) I have now received an email from vegas2web today that says, translated from English, the following: If your credit card is used for deposits you must send a hand-signed, completed copy of the Transaction Declaration Form and successfully complete a confirmation call.</p>
<p>Original:</p>
<p>If your Credit Card is used to make deposits then you are required to send through a hand-signed, completed copy of the Transaction Declaration Form as well as successfully complete a verification call.</p>
<p>urgently ask for help, that's pure chicane</p>
<p>ADDITIONALLY: I have to pay another $ 25 verification fee !!!!!!!!</p>
