<p>The impressive results were primarily due to Mohegan's performance across its digital operations</p>
<p>Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority released its second fiscal 2023 quarter report on Thursday posting double-digit increases across the key performance metrics, but net loss for the period more than tripled.</p>
<p>Mohegan Digital Is Pulling Its Weight</p>
<p>Net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was $405.8 million, registering an increase of 13.2% from $358.5 million the tribal gaming authority reported for the second fiscal 2022 quarter. On a sequential basis, revenues marginally decreased ($406.62 million in fiscal Q1).</p>
<p>Mohegan attributed the year-over-year growth in net revenue to the quarter representing a full period of operations and a return to relatively normal operating conditions at the Niagara Resorts, as well as the continued growth in the company’s online casino gaming and sports wagering operations in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Net revenue varied from $225.9 million at Mohegan Sun (+$10.4 million; $215.5 million in fiscal Q2 2022), $63.2 million at Mohegan Pennsylvania (+$1.1 million; $62.1 million in fiscal Q2 2022), $70.8 million at Niagara Resorts (+$18.5 million; $52.3 million in fiscal Q2 2022), and $22.7 million for Mohegan Digital (+16.8 million; $5.9 million).</p>
<p>Income from operations in the quarter amounted to $63.8 million, up 11.1% from $57.5 million in fiscal Q2 2022. The result was influenced almost entirely by Mohegan Digital with an increase of $16.3 million which was partially offset by the negative reading at Niagara Resorts, $2.9 million.</p>
<p>“Our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $102.1 million reflects the positive results from our properties and digital operations,” commented Raymond Pineault, chief executive officer of Mohegan.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA of $102.1 million registered an increase of 17.8% year-over-year ($86.7 million in fiscal Q2 2022) and a marginal decrease from $101.1 million in fiscal Q1 2023.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.7 million at Mohegan Sun and $16.6 million for Mohegan Digital, decreased by $2.3 million at Niagara Resorts and was almost unchanged at Mohegan Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Non-Cash Adjustment Impacting Niagara Resorts</p>
<p>Mohegan said that the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA at Niagara Resorts was primarily due to a $3.7 million non-cash adjustment as per the Casino Operating and Services Agreement contract asset and the continued reintroduction of certain lower margin non-gaming amenities.</p>
<p>We are encouraged by the strong results from our digital segment and look forward to continued growth in that line of business. Raymond Pineault, CEO, Mohegan</p>
<p>Mohegan’s chief financial officer, Carol Anderson, also commented on the results, noting that the fiscal Q2 2023 Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.2% “was 337 basis points favorable” compared to Mohegan’s Q2 2019, and “99 basis points favorable” compared to Q2 2022.</p>
<p>Mohegan’s liquidity at the end of the quarter stood at $188.8 million in cash and $164.7 million in cash equivalents. In addition, Mohegan had $226.2 million under its senior secured credit facility and an additional $121.9 million under the Niagara Resorts revolving credit facility.</p>
