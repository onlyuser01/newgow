    <h1>Golden Buffalo Casino Dreams Casino No Deposit Walker Casino Casinos In Indianapolis Rolling Hills C</h1>

<p>Thank you for your reply, milena.spegiorin. I checked the T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"7.13. Bonuses offered by Mr.Bet are intended for genuine recreational players only. Abuse of any bonus offer will not be tolerated. Mr.Bet reserves the right to investigate, cancel, suspend or lock any account if bonus abuse is suspected. At our discretion, all bonuses and subsequent gaming activity may be revoked and voided, and deposits returned.</p>
<p>Bonus abuse mentioned above, may include, but are not limited to, these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Delaying game rounds in any game, including free spins and bonus features, to a later time when you have no wagering requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaving large bets on the table, for example in blackjack, and returning to the game after bonus wagering has been completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Playing games with bonus money to build up in-game value, lose the bonus funds, and then cash out on the built-up value during real-money play, Using strategies that take advantage of any software bug or failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working in a syndicate with other players to abuse promotions, deliberately cheating or other unfair behavior;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using multiple accounts to claim a bonus or a free spin offer more than once;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Winnings from "free spin" or "bonus" features initiated with bonus funds but completed after the bonus has been wagered, lost or forfeited will be removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An attempt to turnover Casino bonus or use of bonus spins whilst Real Money is locked in pending Sportsbook bets."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am afraid that if you breached any of the above-mentioned points, the casino doesn't owe you anything, nor it is obliged to refund you your deposits. Especially if those deposits were used when the violation occurred. I can only recommend that you avoid using any of these strategies in the future.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, this complaint will now be rejected. Thank you for your understanding, I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
