<p>Once an underserved market, golf betting is picking up momentum, and some operators are keener than others to make sure that they service the vertical fully. One of those is PointsBet which has revealed that it is integrating IMG Arena’s Golf Event Center into its dedicated app to deliver a better overall experience to golf aficionados and betting fans.</p>
<p>PointsBet Expands Golf Coverage with Golf Event Center</p>
<p>The Golf Event Center covers more than 35,000 betting markets per tournament, making it one of the most wholesome solutions on the market, and adding a lot of flexibility to a customer’s betting experience, which is precisely what PointsBet wants to achieve. PointsBet users will have access to many excellent betting markets – including classic and innovative ones – such as longest drive, total putts on the next hole, next hole score, closest to the pin and so much more.</p>
<p>The markets will be issued for events and tournaments from the PGA TOUR and DP World Tour offering a solid choice of topflight golf. Commenting on this opportunity, PointsBet USA chief strategy officer Eric Foote hailed the opportunity to further expand on PointsBet’s offer in the golf vertical and provide bettors with the quality betting markets that they have always hoped for.</p>
<p>Traditional and in-play golf markets have been one of the top priorities for PointsBet as part of the company’s mission to stand out from competitors and service new verticals. Foote commented on the live betting opportunity in golf as well:</p>
<p>Live betting is without a doubt the future of sports betting and the interest among the golf community is there. With the addition of IMG ARENA’s Golf Event Centre, we’re catering to this demand all while ushering in a new viewing experience for fans that gets them closer to the greens.

<p>Executives Hail the New Partnership as an Important Step Forward</p>
<p>IMG Arena CCO Max Wright was similarly pleased with the news and said that PointsBet was a brand that was known for its commitment to providing customers with the best possible experience, and a strong focus on golf.</p>
<p>PGA TOUR VP of gaming Scott Warfield was similarly pleased with the partnership, noting that the Golf Event Center is known to sports and betting fans as a leading product.</p>
<p>The solution provides PointsBet golf fans with the opportunity to monitor the action in real-time and get quick and reliable updates on their favorite players and their performance in each individual game. The Golf Event Center brings tons of data and information from events such as the Ryder Cup, FedExCup Playoffs, Presidents Cup, The Players Championship, and so many others.</p>
