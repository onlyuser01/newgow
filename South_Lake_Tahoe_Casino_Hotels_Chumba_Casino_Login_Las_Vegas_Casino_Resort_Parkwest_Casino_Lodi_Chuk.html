<p>Sportradar Integrity Services (SIS) announced its roster of international sports organizations partners has expanded following a bet monitoring agreement with the European Table Tennis Union (ETTU).</p>
<p>Integrity Threats Have Intensified over the Years</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement between SIS and the ETTU, Sportradar’s integrity unit will deploy its Universal Fraud Detection System (UFDS) to monitor matches in the European Championship, Men’s and Women’s Champions League, as well as other key sporting events.</p>
<p>Happy to have entered into a partnership with the ETTU, SIS managing director Andreas Krannich pointed in his comments to the “ever-growing integrity threats over the years” that have intensified in the background of recent global events, and the “increased betting interest in sports such as table tennis”.</p>
<p>“At Sportradar, we are fully committed to assisting our sporting partners’ efforts to detect and prevent such threats and look forward to supporting the integrity program of the European Table Tennis Union in the years ahead,” added Krannich.</p>
<p>The UFSD will monitor betting patterns in European Table Tennis competitions while data gathered by the system will be analyzed by a global team of qualified integrity experts to flag any abnormalities or suspicious betting patterns that may suggest match-fixing.</p>
<p>Protecting Table Tennis Integrity Is Top Priority</p>
<p>Acting president of the ETTU Pedro Moura outlined that “protecting the integrity of European Table Tennis is a top priority” for the ETTU, stressing the importance of “robust measures in place to safeguard” competitions from the threat of match-fixing.</p>
<p>“Through this partnership, men’s, women’s and youth events are all now being monitored through the UFDS,” Moura continued, hailing Sportradar’s integrity services industry track record, as well as the company’s bet monitoring capabilities that are expected to play a “crucial role in helping protect the integrity of European Table Tennis events.”</p>
<p>Sportradar’s advanced and proven bet monitoring system, independently assessed and verified by sports betting and integrity experts, has already been deployed to the 2022 European Championship matches in Munich last month.</p>
<p>As a global supplier of sport integrity solutions and partner to over 150 sports federations and leagues, SIS has proven its efficiency having detected more than 7,500 suspicious matches in the past 17 years of which more than 800 taking place this year.</p>
<p>The International Golf Federation (IGF) is one of Sportradar’s latest partners after the prestigious federation recognized within the Olympic and the Paralympic Movement signed a multi-year integrity contract last month to take advantage of UFDS’ bet monitoring capabilities.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq-listed data and technology company posted a 23% increase in second-quarter revenue to beat its expectations but the increase in revenue did not have much of an impact on EBITDA which dropped 13% year-over-year.</p>
