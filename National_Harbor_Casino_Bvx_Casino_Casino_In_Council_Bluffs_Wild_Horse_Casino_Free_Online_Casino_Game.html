<p>The NFL odds for Week 10 of the regular season features three heavy favorites, as the Baltimore Ravens, New Orleans Saints, and Indianapolis Colts all square off against inferior opponents on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Ravens are emerging as a serious Super Bowl contender after knocking off an undefeated New England Patriots team on Sunday Night Football a week ago.</p>
<p>Baltimore, now 6-2, goes on the road to face a winless Cincinnati team. The Ravens are favored by 10.5 points, with the over/under at 44.5 points. FanDuel has the moneyline at Baltimore -500, Cincinnati +400, a $100 bet respectively netting $20 and $400.</p>
<p>We have a lot of heart over here, a lot of confidence, and we’re here to win,” Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson said this week.</p>
<p>The Bengals are the last remaining winless team in the NFL. FanDuel has their odds of going 0-16 at +750 (implied odds of 11.76 percent).</p>
<p>Week 10 NFL Odds</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints (7-1) look to keep their win streak alive at home against the lowly Atlanta Falcons (1-7). The Saints have won six in a row, and are favored by 13.5 points against the Dirty Birds.</p>
<p>The over/under is at 51.5 points, and moneyline Atlanta +530, New Orleans -700. A $100 moneyline bet on the Saints nets just $14.29.</p>
<p>The Saints have not only survived but thrived without franchise QB Drew Brees. Backup Teddy Bridgewater led New Orleans to a perfect 5-0 during the star’s absence. Brees returned October 27 against the Arizona Cardinals, throwing for 373 yards and three touchdowns in the team’s 31-9 win.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis Colts look to bounce back from a devastating two-point loss in Pittsburgh. The 5-3 Colts host the 1-7 Miami Dolphins, and are favored by 12.5 on Sunday. The over/under is 44 points, and moneyline Miami +430, Indy -550.</p>
<p>Sunday Card Cardinals vs. Buccaneers -4.5 Bills vs. Browns -2.5 Lions vs. Bears -2.5 Chiefs -5.5 vs. Titans Giants -2.5 vs. Jets Panthers vs. Packers -5.5 Rams -3.5 vs. Steelers Vikings vs. Cowboys -3</p>
<p>Monday Night Showdown</p>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers remain the lone unbeaten team in the NFL. They’ll have to wait another day to try and reach 9-0.</p>
<p>San Francisco will have nine days off by the time they kick-off Monday Night Football at home against the visiting 7-2 Seattle Seahawks. The Niners won Thursday Night Football on November 1 against the Cardinals.</p>
<p>The 49ers are favored by 6.5 points against the Seahawks. The over/under is at 47.5 points, and moneyline Seattle +230. San Fran -270.</p>
<p>FanDuel has odds on the Bay Area franchise running the table in the regular season to go 16-0. The line is currently at +1100 (implied odds of 8.33 percent).</p>
<p>The 1972 Dolphins are the only team to complete a perfect season by winning every regular season game and go on to win the Super Bowl. But the regular season at the time consisted of only 14 games.</p>
<p>The 2007 Patriots went 16-0 in the regular season, but lost the Super Bowl to the New York Giants.</p>
