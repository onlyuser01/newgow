<p>SOFTSWISS has become the latest company to show support for "Pink October," a global initiative dedicated to raising awareness about breast cancer. To this end, one of the best-established technological and cutting-edge companies in iGaming will host a series of events dedicated to helping better understand the illness, its early symptoms, and prevention.</p>
<p>Pink October will be supported by SOFTSWISS employees globally, the company revealed in a press release. Breast cancer may affect anyone regardless of gender and self-examination is one of the best ways to ensure that it is caught in the early stages. Being part of this initiative resonates with SOFTSWISS’ ethos which promotes commitment and corporate responsibility and is involved in the well-being of its employees.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS has planned several important, useful, and ultimately beneficial events with the company launching an education campaign within its ranks aptly named "Let’s think about Pink" along with the Pink October Breakfast in the company’s offices globally, and not least – a complimentary preventive check-up with medical professionals to make sure that those who want to get examined have an easy access to do just that.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS CMO Valentina Bagniya has welcomed the opportunity to see SOFTSWISS join yet another important campaign and global cause. The company has previously participated in the Cleaning up the World campaign, and it also contributed to the relief efforts in Turkey through donations. All in all, SOFTSWISS’ total contributions to charitable causes amount to €1.7m in 2022 alone.</p>
<p>Bagniya has hailed the company’s commitment to the initiative and said that its active involvement in Pink October was one of the most worthwhile causes that SOFTSWISS had joined so far.</p>
<p>"That is why SOFTSWISS places a high priority on the well-being, happiness, and personal fulfillment of its employees. We believe that only truly inspired professionals, united by common values, can drive the iGaming industry forward," Bagniya concluded.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS has turned social causes into a core mission statement of its companies and its sound financial standing, ensuring that it invests meaningfully in the future of many worthwhile causes, such as green initiatives. So far as Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards go, SOFTSWISS has maintained a firm hand at the rudder and has fixated on the future.</p>
