<p>Masters Odds Favor Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, and Justin Thomas, But a Familiar Name Lurks</p>

<p>The shortest Masters odds feature a familiar bunch of young guns, as the world’s best golfers descend on the first major of the year in Augusta, Georgia.</p>

<p>Masters 2015 champion Jordan Spieth, world #1 Dustin Johnson, and reigning PGA champ Justin Thomas are all at 10/1 at the Westgate SuperBook. Respectively 24, 33, and 24-years-old, the three golfers have combined won 37 PGA Tour events and five majors.</p>
<p>The man with the next-shortest Masters odds has singlehandedly won 79 PGA Tour events and 14 major championships, including four green jackets.</p>
<p>After the trio at 10/1, Tiger Woods has the fourth-shortest odds at 12/1. He shares that line with 2017 runner-up Justin Rose and Rory McIlroy, the latter who would cap off the career grand slam with a win on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top ten is Phil Mickelson (2004, 2006, 2010 Masters winner), Bubba Watson (2012, 2014 winner), and Rickie Fowler all at 16/1. Jason Day is next at 18/1.</p>
<p>Last year’s winner Sergio Garcia is at 30/1 despite some recent strong play. He’s made all four cuts he’s played this year, and has finished T7, 4th, and T9 in his last three tournaments. Danny Willet, who hasn’t had a top 25 finish in a PGA Tour event since his 2016 Masters victory, is a distant 500/1.</p>
<p>The SuperBook says the most money is on Fowler, followed by JT, Woods, DJ, and Jon Rahm (18/1).</p>
<p>Woods became the Masters favorite in March, but recent action on Spieth, Johnson, and Thomas have moved those players ahead. The Masters field of 87 players is the smallest since 1998.</p>
<p>Golf World Buzzing</p>
<p>Tiger Woods hasn’t played in the Masters since 2015 due to a series of injuries. In May 2017, it seemed unlikely he’d be driving down Magnolia Lane this week after he was arrested on suspicion of DUI in Florida, which was later determined to be a dangerous cocktail of prescription pain killers (alcohol was not involved).</p>
<p>In January, Woods’ Masters odds in Las Vegas were as long as 100/1. A string of solid play, which includes a runner-up finish at the Valspar and T5 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, one of the Tour’s strongest non-major fields, has greatly shortened his Augusta line.</p>
<p>TV ratings always surge when Tiger’s in the mix, as does handle at Nevada and internet sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Bovada has numerous props teed up online including Tiger vs. the field (Woods +1200, The Field -3300). Other Woods betting opportunities include him making the cut (-900) and missing the cut (+500), as well as a top 5 finish (+250), top 10 finish (even money), and top 20 finish (-250).</p>
<p>New Champion Likely</p>
<p>Masters winners receive lifetime exemptions into the tournament. Thirteen decided not to play this week, but 20 are still in the field.</p>
<p>Of those 20, 13 are using their Category 1 exemption, and otherwise wouldn’t qualify. The shortest odds of the seven qualified through multiple categories not named Spieth, Mickelson, Watson or Garcia is Adam Scott at 60/1. Zach Johnson is at 100/1, and Charl Schwartzel is at 125/1.</p>
<p>Fan favorite Fred Couples is at 300/1. The longest odds on past champs are on Larry Mize, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam, Jose Maria Olazabal, and Mark O’Meara at 5000/1.</p>
