    <h1>Mostbet Casino Casino St Charles Hotels And Casinos Near Me Casino Free Spin Worley Casino Rightland</h1>

<p>Ontario is so close to launching its private gambling market with operators and companies welcomed to join as soon as April 4. To this end, Rightlander, a company that specializes in ensuring the safety of consumers in the gambling industry, said that its range of compliance and integrity tools will now be available to the Canadian province on launch.</p>
<p>Rightlander Adds to Market Sustainability in Ontario</p>
<p>Rightlander already collaborates with 100 different partners across North America and has been offering guidance on how operators and their suppliers may work on guaranteeing the integrity of their industry while protecting consumers. A good deal of the focus lies on affiliate companies that are susceptible to exaggeration of their promotional offers.</p>
<p>However, Canada and Ontario in particular have created clear-cut and demanding standards for what constitutes acceptable social responsibility and player protection. To this end, Rightlander will be able to assist brands in the market to meet the prerequisites necessary for the safe and smooth operation of the business.</p>
<p>Rightlander founder Ian Sims said: “It was only a matter of time before the Canadian iGaming sector started down the path to regulation. We have been scanning at the state level in the USA for a while now and are well equipped to monitor from individual states in Canada, like Ontario.”</p>
<p>Rightlander has an advanced platform that allows it to quickly and efficiently scan affiliate offerings and look for common issues such as bad geo-targeting or prohibited marketing practices, which could help operators avoid stiff penalties or worse.</p>
<p>So far, dozens of organizations have obtained a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, which means that the market is going to get busy and quick following the April 4 launch.</p>
<p>Businesses to Benefit from Rightlander’s Launch</p>
<p>To ensure that it stays this way, though, companies would have to ensure that they are compliant. Rightlander is not the only company looking out for the integrity and sustainability of the market, and more importantly – consumer protection.</p>
<p>There are others, too, including the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), which teamed up with the Canadian Gaming Association through a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure that sports betting markets remain free of manipulation and corruption.</p>
<p>World Series of Poker and GG Poker Network have recently teamed up to launch WSOP.CA and make more poker options available to Canada.</p>
