<p>The Arizona Cardinals are the only team in the NFL that’s still undefeated. Will that change in Week 6 when they travel to Ohio to take on the Cleveland Browns?</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think that might be the case – they’ve given the role of the favorite to the Browns, who are currently 3-2.</p>
<p>To find out why that is the case, you just need to keep on reading!</p>

<p>The Browns are Looking for Their First Win Over the Cards in 18 Years</p>
<p>The last time the Browns beat the Cardinals was in November 2003. The two have met four times since, with their most recent duel happening in December 2019.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since, with both teams improving in all areas. The Browns, for instance, look much better in the offense, thanks to the emergence of their quarterback Baker Mayfield.</p>
<p>He’s been doing okay so far in 2021, but the Browns fans feel as he could do even better. Mayfield surely has plenty of weapons in his armory, meaning that his team should be able to score plenty of points on Sunday.</p>
<p>The offense, however, isn’t Cleveland’s worry; it’s their defense. In Week 5, they conceded 47 points against the LA Chargers, their worst tally since December. The bad news for them is that they’re facing an even better offense this Sunday.</p>
<p>Kyler Murray Looks Unstoppable at the Moment</p>
<p>Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray is currently the betting favorite to win the regular-season MVP award. The guy’s been nothing short of sensational so far in literally all aspects of the game.</p>
<p>Luckily for him, he has plenty of options to choose from on the receiving end, which explains why the Cards have already scored 10 passing touchdowns. What’s equally impressive is that their rushing game has also been sublime – they’ve scored eight rushing TDs so far.</p>
<p>Their defense has also been really good, which is no surprise knowing how good players they got on the roster. Chandler Jones, J.J. Watt, Zaven Collins, Isaiah Simmons and others look capable of stopping almost any offense in the NFL.</p>
<p>That said, this team definitely looks capable of extending their winning streak. Still, the Browns are favored for a reason – they’re one of the best teams in the league.</p>
<p>The most probable scenario in Sunday’s Cardinals vs Browns clash is a win for the visitors, but with a very narrow margin.</p>
<p>Pick: Arizona Cardinals to win; over is likely to hit in this game.</p>
