<p>A new study has taken a look at the habits of UK student gamblers who have confirmed that this form of pastime has had an impact on their university experience, and not for the best</p>
<p>A survey conducted at various UK universities and interviewing 2,003 students in December 2022 established that 71% of all students interviewed had gambled in the 12 months prior to the time of asking the questions. To get to this result, Gamstop and Ygam commissioned a study from Censuswide, a research company.</p>
<p>Students Gamble in Unexpected Numbers</p>
<p>According to the survey’s findings at least 28% of interviewed students were at moderate risk of becoming addicted or exhibiting problem gambling behavior. However, 24% of respondents were in fact classified as problem gamblers, the study confirmed.</p>
<p>Another 50% of all respondents confirmed that they had seen their studying impacted by gambling. Some 13% said that they had struggled with paying for food as a result of their gambling habits. Another 10% added that they missed lectures and other educational sessions to gamble, and 10% said that they had seen their grades and assignments deteriorating because of gambling habits.</p>
<p>Another 9% were struggling with paying bills at their accommodation while studying. The study went a step further to try and take a multi-pronged approach towards analyzing the root causes of gambling and how some were able to balance while others could not.</p>
<p>The interviewees had to answer questions modeled after the Problem Gambling Severity Index, which is the national benchmark for measuring what gambling-related issues individuals may be experiencing. It’s also a good scientific gauge when it comes to trying to determine how likely people are to suffer because of gambling.</p>
<p>Digging into the numbers further, the study established that 45% of the students who had gambled in the prior 12 months were unaware that their universities actually offered support for people who are struggling with gambling problems.</p>
<p>Another 48% said that they were gambling in the hopes of making money – a worrying trend since gambling is advertised as an activity that is supposed to be taken as entertainment and not a source of financial stability.</p>
<p>No Reward, High Risk, and Problem Gambling</p>
<p>Fittingly, only 11% reported that they had made money once a week on average. A third of all students who gambled confirmed that they bet around $25 on weekly bets. Another 23% said that they gambled up to $60 a week, and another 13% were spending around $60 and $120 a week.</p>
<p>The study was very comprehensive in successfully pinpointing the habits and risk factors of students. Some 8% of interviewees said that they had borrowed money to sustain their gambling habit – either from family or friends. Payday loans were used by 6% of respondents, another worrying trend.</p>
<p>The study also looked into how students perceived other high-risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies. More than 40% of interviewees had bought a digital currency. Ygam chief executive Dr Jane Rigbye has urged the government to act and protect young people by educating them on the risk of problem gambling. Rigbye added:</p>
<p>We can now see that not only are a large percentage of the student population gambling on a regular basis, many of them are doing so in a way that may cause them to experience harm. Ygam chief executive Dr Jane Rigbye</p>
<p>But for any significant change to be made says Rigbye, universities will have to recognize the problem and prioritize the issue as a serious matter that needs addressing.</p>
