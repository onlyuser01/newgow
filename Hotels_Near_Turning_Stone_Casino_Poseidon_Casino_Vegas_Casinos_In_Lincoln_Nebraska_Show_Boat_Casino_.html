    <h1>Hotels Near Turning Stone Casino Poseidon Casino Vegas Casinos In Lincoln Nebraska Show Boat Casino</h1>

<p>I did not say you got paid by casinos based on your complaint outcomes.</p>
<p>I did however say you get paid for being casino affiliates.</p>
<p>Below Scenario</p>
<p>I open a Chipstars Account via Casino Guru link lose EUR26,000 and you get zero? That is nonsense.</p>
<p>As an affiliate of that casino you will either get paid a percentage of my losses or will get paid on my turnover or will get paid a fixed amount. You will NOT get zero and lets not pretend that you do.</p>
<p>"Honestly, it's quite tiring to read accusations from players who blame us for being ALWAYS on casino's side"</p>
<p>Investigate complaints based on the evidence you are provided with and be consistent in your rulings then. You can't say if a player breaches a casino's T&amp;C's you find in favour of the casino but then in my case the Casino breaches their T&amp;C's then you still find in the casinos favour. A win/win situation for the casino and zero accountability from Casino Guru if they breach their own T&amp;C's.</p>
<p>I have made my point and will not be replying further.</p>
<p>You have your views and obviously you are not going to bite the hand that feeds you. I have different views on the matter but that's life and we move on.</p>
