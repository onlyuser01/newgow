<p>DraftKings announced today its media expansion would continue with a new video podcast that is slated to debut on May 2 and feature television personality and former Notre Dame Football player Mike Golic Jr. and his former teammate and friend Brandon Newman.</p>
<p>Entice Everyday Sports Fan</p>
<p>Gojo, the new daily podcast which will air five days a week across Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, the iHeartRadio app, as well as everywhere else where podcasts are available will offer a unique perspective on trending topics in sports and culture.</p>
<p>“Mike’s addition to the media family is another example of DraftKings partnering with high-profile talent and trusted personalities across sports media. Leveraging his strong social currency, he and Brandon will tackle subjects that represent the broader interests and hobbies of today’s sports fan.” Stacie McCollum, VP of Programming, DraftKings</p>
<p>Golic Jr. and his friend Newman will break down the biggest games of the week Monday to Friday, accompanied by regular guests and prominent personalities from the world of sports and media to appease the everyday sports fan and those with skin in the game.</p>
<p>Commenting on his first project with DraftKings, Golic Jr. outlined his vision for the future of sports media was one of the drivers behind his decision to join the Boston-based business. The other was the freedom he was given by DraftKings to express his passion with the content he creates.</p>
<p>“When I look at the future of sports media, joining DraftKings was an easy decision for me. As someone who is passionate about creating content, having the freedom to develop original programming is the perfect opportunity at the perfect time. I’m excited to partner with Brandon as we take our individual and shared experiences as former teammates to the airwaves.” Mike Golic Jr.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ fast-growing network of sports podcasts seeks to satisfy the taste of the everyday fan, providing a one-stop destination for entertainment delivered via diverse personalities and their on-the-action experiences and perspectives.</p>
<p>Growing Its Podcast Network</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, DraftKings expanded the scope of its programming anchored around ‘The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz’, a reportedly $50 million deal for the show’s broadcasting rights for three years, with the addition of two baseball podcasts, ‘Baseball Is Dead’ and ‘Jared Carrabis Podcast’. DraftKings also hired prominent baseball expert and journalist Jared Carrabis to host both.</p>
<p>By the end of March, DraftKings relaunched the ‘GM Shuffle’ podcast, featuring NFL executive Michael Lombardi and new host and sports analyst Femi Abebefe. The prominent duo is discussing pro football’s hot topics on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Also in March, on St.Patrick’s Day, DraftKings premiered its original sports-focused podcast show ‘Golic and Smetty’ featuring veteran broadcaster Mike Golic Sr. and journalist Jessica Smetana.</p>
