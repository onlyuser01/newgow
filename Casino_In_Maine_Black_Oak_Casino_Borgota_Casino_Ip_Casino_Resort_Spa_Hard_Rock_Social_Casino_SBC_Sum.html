    <h1>Casino In Maine Black Oak Casino Borgota Casino Ip Casino Resort Spa Hard Rock Social Casino SBC Sum</h1>

<p>SBC has crowned its portfolio with another success story after the organization announced encouraging results from one of its most recent industry gatherings, the SBC Summit Tbilisi 2023. Held in the capital of Georgia, the event gathered more than 1,000 delegates at the Sheraton Grand Metechi Palace in Georgia between October 23 and October 24.</p>
<p>The expo focused on both the Georgian market, but also on Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Balkans, bringing together many distinguished specialists who had been looking to exchange know-how, strike new business opportunities and generally reaffirm their presence in lucrative regional markets.</p>
<p>The event was co-hosted with sports and iGaming management company SMH which previously collaborated with SBC on the highly successful SBC Summit CIS, held in Kyiv back in 2021. SBC Summit Tbilisi saw a number of prominent companies participate, amongst which were Aviatrix, Alea, BetConstruct, Betlive, Crocobet, EGT Digital &amp; Amusnet, VBET, and many others.</p>
<p>This gathering was hailed as a success by SMH CEO &amp; Founder Lasha Machavariani who hailed the organizations’ efforts in hosting a new business platform that advances the industry and helps build connections and opportunities for established and emerging players. Machavariani added:</p>
<p>"We are proud to have conducted such a great event, and I can honestly state that SBC Summit Tbilisi has brought top-quality SBC standards to the region. This event managed to bring together the iGaming and related industries from Eastern Europe, the Black Sea, and the Central Asian region, establishing a new hub for sharing experiences, networking, and forming new partnerships."</p>
<p>Machavariani also paid his compliments to the SBC team which demonstrated unmatched professionalism and quality, and also the many sponsors that rallied their support behind what could be one of the flagship events of the region moving forward. Tbilisi has been confirmed for a return next year as well.</p>
<p>The gathering also featured input from 40 regional experts who participated in discussions and made sure delegates walked away a little more knowledgeable about the industry than when they arrived. Some of the speakers included Forbes Editor-in-Chief GiorgiIsakadze, Eurobet CEO Maia Kopinadze, EvenBet Gaming CEO Dmitry Starostenkov, TotoGaming CMO TerezaTokmajyan and many others.</p>
<p>More details about next year’s edition of SBC Summit Tbilisi will be forthcoming in good time.</p>
