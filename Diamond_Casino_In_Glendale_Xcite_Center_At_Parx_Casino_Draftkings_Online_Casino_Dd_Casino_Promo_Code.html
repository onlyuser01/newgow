<p>Cupcakes review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Cupcakes takes players to a whimsical realm of desserts.</p>
<p>Players will channel their inner child as they discover rolling hills of frosting and plenty of colorful candies. In this magical world, giant cupcakes are just a part of the landscape.</p>
<p>Players looking for a cheerful, light-hearted aesthetic will be captivated by this slot.</p>
<p>Win in the Cupcakes slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Cupcakes is a meandering tune filled with bells and heavenly vocalizations. This contributes to this slot's relaxing vibe.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with fruit-shaped candy symbols animated in a cartoon style. Grapes, strawberries, orange wedges, and blueberries are all portrayed in sweet-form.</p>
<p>The bright hues of the candy symbols contrast with the pastel pink frosting landscape in the background. Sharp-eyed players will notice a purple soda river that flows across the scene.</p>
<p>This slot’s titular cupcakes are as large as mountains in the background, and players will have fun imagining climbing each one.</p>
<p>Together, the animation and soundtrack create an enchanting fantasy world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Cupcakes is a six-reel, seven-row slot.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for landing 8 or more matching symbols on the reels in any location. On any one spin, only the highest winning combination is awarded.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols will vanish after paying out, and new symbols will fall in from above.</p>
<p>For 100x their total bet, players can opt to buy into the Free Spins feature (see further details below).</p>
<p>Multiplier win in the Free Spins feature</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>This slot features special Cupcake symbols which cover a larger area of 2x2 positions. Cupcake symbols always come with a multiplier with a value from 2x to 100x, but cannot contribute to forming winning combinations.</p>
<p>Whenever Gumdrop symbols create a winning combination, Cupcake symbols of the matching color will collect them. Once Cupcake symbols have accumulated 10 or more Gumdrop symbols, the Cupcake symbol will award its multiplier and vanish.</p>
<p>During both the base game and the Free Spins feature, 1, 2, 3, or 4 Cupcake symbols may be visible on the reels.</p>
<p>If 5 or more Gumdrop symbols form a win on certain reels, the Crush feature is triggered. This prompts an extra Cupcake symbol to appear on the screen.</p>
<p>When players land 3 or more Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature begins. The number of Scatters that trigger the feature determines the number of free spins players receive. 10 free spins are awarded for 3 Scatters, 13 free spins for 4 Scatters, and 16 free spins for 5 Scatters.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature can be retriggered if players land at least 3 Scatters during the feature. In this case 3 Scatters award 3 additional free spins, 4 Scatters award 6 additional free spins, and 5 Scatters award 9 additional free spins.</p>
<p>The awarded Multiplier does not reset until the end of the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Cupcakes is 94.01%, well below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€200 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Cupcakes is high, making it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We propose a strategy of targeting the highest possible volatility when selecting slots.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Cupcakes slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility cupcake-themed slot.</p>
<p>The fantastical animation and creative bonuses might draw some players in, but the low RTP of Cupcakes is a let down.</p>
<p>Mathematically-minded players would do well to seek out slots that offer more favorable RTPs.</p>
