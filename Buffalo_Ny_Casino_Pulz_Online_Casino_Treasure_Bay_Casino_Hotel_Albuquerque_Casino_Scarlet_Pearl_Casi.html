    <h1>Buffalo Ny Casino Pulz Online Casino Treasure Bay Casino Hotel Albuquerque Casino Scarlet Pearl Casi</h1>

<p>Hello and thank you for your help.</p>
<p>I made withdrawal request on 3 or April. I would not start to panic in other case, its common thing at some casinos delays but behavior of Dogs Fortune clearly indicates that they are not willing to pay and even to give a reason why.</p>
<p>It was my first time when I was trying to withdraw after I played with my first deposit and sports deposit bonus.</p>
<p>Support was helpful when I contacted them to ask about deposit bonuses and another time when I was trying to clarify how much wagering left. But things with support changed after my withdrawal request. When it was rejected I wrote to live chat and agent told me that it seems that my bonus is not fully wagered. So she strated with lies already. Bonus was fully cleared and it was visible in the profile. Also I made more bets when required. She told me that in 24 hours they will send me email about how much wagering left and gave me advice to continues play while waiting for response. I continues to play and won some more. But of course didnt get any email again. I ordered withdrawal request again and it was rejected again. And usually when casinos rejecting withdrawals they send emails with a given reason and here nothing. Again you need to go to ask. So second time they even didnt answer me to live chat. But it was night. So I sent email. Of course again I didnt get any reply from them. Later I just ordered for fun 100 euro request and until now its pending. But when I wrote to support live chat, agent replied to me however when I asked to check about my withdrawal chat member never came back to the chat.</p>
<p>So from my previous experience I understand that this casino is not willing to pay. They do the same things like one casino which is closed now and never paid me. And of course I checked all the possible comments about Dogs Fortune and didnt find single comment where player would say that he was paid but many comments from players who never was paid and same behavior of the casino.</p>
