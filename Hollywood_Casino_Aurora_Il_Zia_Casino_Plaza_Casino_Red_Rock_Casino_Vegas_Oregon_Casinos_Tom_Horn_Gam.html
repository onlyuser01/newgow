<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted content agreement, Tom Horn Gaming agreed to power Favbet with popular games such as the sought-after title from the 243 Crystal Fruits series, 243 Crystal Fruits Reversed.

<p>While the latest collaboration with Favbet helps expand the reach of Tom Horn Gaming's titles, it also complements the growth of the iGaming developer. At the same time, Tom Horn Gaming confirmed that it anticipates further expansion in Europe, hinting that "a number of deals" on the Old Continent are currently in the making.</p>
<p>Valeria Veșca, Favbet Romania's Marketing Manager, shared her excitement about the content agreement with Tom Horn Gaming in a statement.
