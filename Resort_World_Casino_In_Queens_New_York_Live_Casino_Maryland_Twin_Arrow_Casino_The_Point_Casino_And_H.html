<p>Despite losing 2-0 to Dallas on Wednesday, St. Louis City is still sitting in the No. 1 position in the Western Conference of the 2023 MLS. The question is how long will these guys stay there? There are several teams breathing by their necks, which is why the new MLS franchise needs to go for a win on Saturday against Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>

<p>St. Louis City Players Determined to Bounce Back After a 2-0 Loss Midweek</p>
<p>St. Louis City players took a trip to Texas midweek to play the remaining ~40 minutes of the FC Dallas game that was originally abandoned due to bad weather conditions. The game resumed at 50th minute on the clock, and St. Louis ended up conceding twice before the final whistle. Actually, both of FC Dallas’s goals happened after the 80th minute of the game.</p>
<p>The St. Louis men just seemed out of focus in that game, which is probably true considering that got another big game coming up. The game in question is Saturday’s duel with Los Angeles Galaxy, which is played on their turf. At home, Bradley Carnell’s men are 6-0-2 this season in the MLS, with a score differential of 22-6.</p>
<p>Their strongest weapon has been team spirit, as evident from the fact that there are 10 outfield players on the St. Louis City roster who have scored at least a goal.</p>
<p>Has LA Galaxy’s Resurrection Started?</p>
<p>LA Galaxy is sitting at the very bottom of the Western Conference table with just 12 points after 15 rounds. The most successful MLS franchise is 3-3-9 this season, with a score difference of 13-26. However, two of Galaxy’s three wins in 2023 happened within the last five rounds.</p>
<p>One of those wins happened in the previous round. Galaxy defeated Real Salt Lake 3-2 on the road, with each goal scored by a different player – Gaston Brugman, Memo Rodriguez, and Tyler Boyd.</p>
<p>As a result, Galaxy now has 11 different players who got on the scoresheet in 2023, but just two of them scored more than one goal (Dejan Joveljic and Tyler Boyd). The man who was this team’s scoring leader last season – Chicharito – is still at one goal to his name, which he scored back in Week 3 of the 2023 MLS.</p>
<p>St. Louis City vs. Los Angeles Galaxy Prediction</p>
<p>We predict goals galore at CITYPARK on Sunday. Both St. Louis City and Los Angeles Galaxy are bound to score at least a goal in this game. But which team will be the one to score more? We think the home team. It’s just that they look way more dangerous than LA Galaxy at the moment.</p>
<p>Picks: St. Louis City to win &amp; over 2.5 goal</p>
