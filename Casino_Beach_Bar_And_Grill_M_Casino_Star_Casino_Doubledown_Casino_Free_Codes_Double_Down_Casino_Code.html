<p>Big Bass Bonanza Hold and Spinner review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Big Bass Bonanza Hold and Spinner has a fishing theme.</p>
<p>The game is the latest in a series of titles in the Big Bass series from Pragmatic Play and Reel Kingdom. Previous titles include Big Bass Bonanza, Big Bass Bonanza Megaways, and a Christmas spin-off, Christmas Big Bass Bonanza. The character from the series even went to the land and appeared in the Club Tropicana slot from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The titles have been hugely successful for the developers. They keep things simple, with the story focusing on a cheery fisherman trying to catch himself the biggest fish possible.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>If you’ve had the joy of playing one of the Big Bass Bonanza slots before, then you will know what to expect from Big Bass Bonanza Hold and Spinner. The game’s reels sit just beneath the surface of a lake, with the reels being populated by prize-bearing fish and various bits of fishing equipment.</p>
<p>The overall theme for the game is positive, with bright colours bouncing off the screen on both your mobile and desktop. Regarding graphics, Big Bass Bonanza Hold and Spinner is slightly more polished than its predecessors, but you shouldn’t expect to be fully immersed underwater here.</p>
<p>There are some nice sound effects thrown on top of an upbeat soundtrack. The launch of a bonus round is greeted with a tugboat's horn, while various reeling sounds help bring the action to life at different stages.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay for Big Bass Bonanza Hold and Spinner is very conventional, with the focus being on the bonus rounds. The slot uses a 5x3 set-up with 10 active paylines on every win.</p>
<p>Winning combinations are made when players land matching combinations of three or more starting on the leftmost reel. The paylines can be checked in the game’s paytable, as well as other important bits of information.</p>
<p>You will find the controls under the reels, with the stake adjustment options on either side of the spin button.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Big Bass Bonanza Hold and Spinner bursts into life with its bonus rounds. The Collection feature that has helped put the series on the map makes its return in the game’s Free Spins round. This is launched by landing three or more Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>Players are given 10 spins. During the round, any time a Wild Fisherman symbol lands with a Fish symbol, its value is instantly collected. Wilds are also collected in the game in a meter. The first four collected increase the global multiplier for the game by x2, the second four multiply x3, and the third four does this by x10. Each time you collect four, it also adds 10 extra spins. The spins are launched when your current set is finished, and the multiplier is applied.</p>
<p>The titular Hold &amp; Spinner bonus is the new addition to this game. This is launched when three Money symbols land. These are held in place, and four respins are rewarded. The respins take place on a new set of reels, with only Money symbols and blank spaces appearing. Every time a new Money symbol lands, it triggers the collection of all values on the reels for the current spin. Following this, the spin count is reset.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The Big Bass Bonanza Hold and Spinner slot uses a similar model to other titles in the series. The maximum win is a generous 10,000x your stake, with the RTP sitting around the industry average at 96.07%. There are also versions available with lower RTPs, so be sure to check.</p>
<p>The slot has been given 5/5 for volatility by Pragmatic Play. Our slot strategies put an emphasis on playing higher volatility slots, making this game a great choice.</p>
<p>The minimum bet in the game is £0.10, and the maximum is £250. You can adjust the coin size, stake per line, and total bet by clicking the +/- arrows on either side of the spin button.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Big Bass Bonanza Hold and Spinner keeps things nice and familiar for fans of the series."If it isn’t broken, then don’t fix it" appears to be Pragmatic Play’s approach here, and you can’t blame them.</p>
<p>This is a worthy entry into the series, with the titular Hold &amp; Spinner bonus being just enough to freshen things up while also keeping fans of the series happy.</p>
