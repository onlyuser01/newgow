<p>Not all systems are functional yet, but the casino giant is ready to operate normally</p>
<p>American gambling and hospitality juggernaut MGM Resorts International recently suffered a devastating cybersecurity issue that forced it to shut down computers and websites and crippled its operations. In one of its latest statements, the company revealed that its properties are now operating normally.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts informed consumers that its employees are ready to help guests with any intermittent issues. The company also announced that any reservations booked between September 13 and 24 can be canceled or changed without any fees.</p>
<p>We are pleased that all of our hotels and casinos are operating normally. Our amazing employees are ready to help guests with any intermittent issues. We thank you for your patience and look forward to welcoming you soon. MGM Resorts statement</p>
<p>However, the company noted that certain loyalty program functionalities may still be unavailable. At the time of MGM’s notification, the online reservation system was still down, which is why the company prompted customers to book reservations at 877-353-987.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts did not disclose when it expects these offerings to become available again.</p>
<p>The Casino Giant Is One among Multiple Victims</p>
<p>MGM Resorts was hit by a cyberattack it described as a “cybersecurity issue” earlier this month. The attack came around the same time Caesars Entertainment was also targeted by hackers.</p>
<p>Later identified as the Scattered Spider group, the hackers reportedly used social engineering to gain hold of valuable company data. The attack caused Moody’s to warn MGM Resorts that its credit rating might be lowered. At the time, MGM Resorts refused to comment.</p>
<p>In the meantime, reports claimed that Caesars Entertainment had been forced to pay a ransom to the hackers in order to secure its business.</p>
<p>Identity management specialist Okta recently spoke with Reuters on the matter, confirming that the ones behind the attack are the ALPHV and Scattered Spider groups, likely working in tandem. Okta noted that MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment are not the only victims of the cyberattacks, disclosing that three other companies were also affected.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the online crypto betting giant Stake.com also suffered a cyberattack. According to the FBI, the crypto casino was targeted by the notorious North Korea-backed Lazarus Group, which stole tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies from the company.</p>
