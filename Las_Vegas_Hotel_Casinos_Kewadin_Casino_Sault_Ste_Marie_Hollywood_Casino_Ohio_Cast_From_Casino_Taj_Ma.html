    <h1>Las Vegas Hotel Casinos Kewadin Casino Sault Ste Marie Hollywood Casino Ohio Cast From Casino Taj Ma</h1>

<p>The gaming solutions provider Inspired Entertainment Inc, supplier of gaming systems, terminals and content for gaming machines, virtual sports products for websites, digital games and a variety of other amusement entertainment solutions, spanning across 35 jurisdictions worldwide, has announces two lucrative deals for partnership that will bring their creative gaming content to the sports betting and online casino industry.</p>
<p>Inspired virtual reality in a traditional sportsbook approach</p>
<p>The Nasdaq traded game content creator signed a deal with Bet365 that will bring their award-winning Virtual Sports series online, running across 11 channels with more than 4800 events per day for the New Jersey-based customers, where Bet365 started operations in 2019 via a partnership with Hard Rock Atlantic City.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be providing our Virtual Sports to bet365 as they expand in the US. We’ve enjoyed many highly successful product launches with them over the years and we’re confident this will be no exception”, Steven Rogers, Inspired Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
<p>This key development represents a change to a more traditional integration, as so far Inspired gaming content Virtual Sports has been provided to other New Jersey operators only via wallet integration, with Bet365 becoming the first bookmaker in the state to launch their content within a sports book environment, mirroring the successfully adopted model in Europe.</p>
<p>888 online casino players to experience Inspired game content, too</p>
<p>In another development regarding the gambling industry, Inspired inked a partnership deal with the recently awarded at the EGR Awards in London 2019 Casino Operator of The Year, 888 Holdings Plc, to launch a wide range of interactive and virtual games, sports, lottery selections, and online casino games through their casino estate.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to launch our range of slot and casino games across the 888casino estate… North American growth is a key priority for Inspired and working with 888 in New Jersey and beyond is a major step in building our North American presence.’, Claire Osborne, VP of Interactive Games at Inspired Entertainment.</p>
<p>The other party to the deal, 888, is equally excited and looking forward to their partnership, as they view Inspired as “an industry-leading authority in multiple regulated markets”, with the expectation for a considerable value to be added to the 888 casino customer who will entertain Inspired interactive gaming solutions and virtual reality first hand.</p>
<p>The new gambling industry public image as entertainment places new requirements for the sports book and online casino operators to constantly search for new game content to provide their customer base with unique experiences – a trend that is set to continue in the future.</p>
