<p>Inclusion and diversity are engrained into Hard Rock International’s brand DNA and mottos, Stephanie Piimauna said</p>
<p>Hard Rock International has launched a new Pride Month campaign, promising a variety of merchandise and activations for LGBT+ people and their supporters. Titled “LOVE OUT LOUD,” the campaign encourages people to be confident in who they are and who they love.</p>
<p>Through its activations, the bar and casino chain will support love in all of its forms. To that end, Hard Rock Heals Foundation, the company’s charity division, will team up with other charity organizations and non-profits to benefit the LGBT+ communities. Hard Rock will also donate $250,000 to the Human Right Campaign and Outright International.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hard Rock will team up with the GRAMMY-nominated multi-platinum, genre-bending artist, Halsey. A queer artist, Halsey has designed two co-branded Hard Rock x Halsey Signature Series Pride Edition T-shirts that fans of the brand will be able to get. In addition, the artist will participate in a private performance at Hard Rock Café London Old Park Lane.</p>
<p>After that, a string of Halsey with String Ensemble Hard Rock Live shows will take place at several other Hard Rock properties. These include Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood (June 24), Hard Rock Casino Northern Indiana (June 30) and Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Sacramento at Fire Mountain (July 2).</p>
<p>In addition to the merchandise designed by Halsey, Hard Rock will also offer a selection of other limited-edition items, bearing the messages “Love All, Serve All” and “All Is One.” The line includes t-shirts, cups, keychains, pins, socks and bandanas. A portion of the proceeds will go to support the LGBT+ community.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Will Promote LGBT+ People Across Its Properties</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned activities and merchandise, Hard Rock will also host a variety of activations at its cafes and hotels. The Hard Rock Cafes all over the world will promote Pride Month, demonstrating the company’s support for the community.</p>
<p>Live performances, Pride-themed menus and customized playlists are just some of the things fans can expect. In addition, Hard Rock will sponsor several Pride parades across Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hard Rock Hotel properties will create exclusive experiences for customers, such as curated suites, promotional menus, Pride playlists and LGBT+ fundraisers. The subsidiary will also feature performances of street artists that promote LGBT+ people.</p>
<p>Stephanie Piimauna, Seminole Hard Rock’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, commented on the matter:</p>
<p>At Hard Rock, acts of service and authentic inclusion are engrained in our brand DNA and everyday mottos, ensuring that all Team Members and guests at our properties are treated with love and respect. Stephanie Piimauna, chief diversity and inclusion officer, Seminole Hard Rock</p>
