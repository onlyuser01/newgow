    <h1>Online Casinos Real Money Luckyland Slots Casino Real Money Download Nugget Casino Hotel Sparks Holl</h1>

<p>Hello Nikolas</p>
<p>No, I haven't gotten my money back yet! But I care about my profit! And I only have 1 account at Neonvegas.com, the reason why the Casino Neonvegas.com blocked me is that I let myself be blocked at their subsidiary casinos, for example Ultracasino!</p>
<ol>
<li>I registered there normally on 01/15/2022!</li>
</ol>
<p>2.I verified myself without any problems</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I deposited via Klarna</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I played my favorite game San quentin xways without a bonus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I won 9127 euros there and paid out 5000 euros!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.I played with the remaining winnings for 3 days and had fun!</p>
<p>After 3 days of playing I wanted to log back into my account but it was blocked! According to support because I locked myself at Ultracasino!</p>
<p>Now to the casino</p>
<p>The management assured me in writing that if my deposits were received by Neonvegas, I would get my winnings paid out! See support (bettina) after 2 days a new email came that my prize was canceled and I get my deposits refunded! See screenshot Support (Anna)! It is just rude to "circumvent" a written contract and I have notified MGA.org of such an act! The casino claims I tricked their security system.. No, I verified myself and signed up normally with all my data, which I also enter everywhere! A bottomless cheek to assume something like that! Although I don't care what happens at Ultracasino, I'll say it anyway</p>
<p>The terms and conditions do not state that my prize may be canceled! Fact is I only have 1 account at Neonvegas! On top of that, I don't have a problem with the game, I was just angry at the time because I had a bad luck! I bring chat and email as proof!</p>
<p>Kind regards hovhannes v<strong><em>*</em></strong>*</p>
