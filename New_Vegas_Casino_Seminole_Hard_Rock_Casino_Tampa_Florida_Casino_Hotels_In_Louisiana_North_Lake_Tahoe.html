<p>Pragmatic Play Rolls Out “Juicy Fruits” Classic Slot</p>
<p>Fruit slots are here 20 years after the iGaming industry arrived and transformed the way we enjoy casinos. Today, Pragmatic Play brings its latest slot game, pivoting around the traditional fruit slot mechanic with Juicy Fruits, putting a modern twist on a classic theme.</p>
<p>This 5-by-5-grid game comes with high volatility and features 50 paylines, expanding the chances to win further. Pragmatic has decided to imbue the traditional gameplay experience by plastering several bonus features on top and boosting the enjoyment factor to make things better.</p>
<p>As to the actual fruits, they are all there. You have low-paying cherry, lemon, apricot, strawberry, raspberry, kiwi, watermelon, and more to give you that retro feeling and nostalgic gameplay. Yet, the twist here is that the Lucky 7 symbol can trigger a 24x multiplier for a five-of-a-kind payline.</p>
<p>The Crown symbol is used as a Wild symbol, and it will substitute for any missing combination, helping you get that crunch-time wins after all. Besides, there is a bonus feature, which means you will get even better synergies with the game. You can trigger six free spins through Diamond symbols.</p>
<p>Empowering Gameplay through Smart Features</p>
<p>Better yet, you can retrigger the free spins, meaning more winnings are waiting. The maximum number of retriggers sits at 18, which is plenty of bonus rounds to go around. Pragmatic has also baked in a special Ante Bet feature, which will be available to players in some jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Basically, the Ante Bet feature will increase the wager size by 20% but also boost your chances of hitting the free spins feature. Commenting on the latest arrival, Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely said that Juicy Fruits would appeal to classic slot enthusiasts through its visual execution.</p>
<p>Yet, there is more than meets the eye, Barzely informs. “With modern features implemented neatly into a traditional design, our latest slot ticks all the boxes for our playing customers all around the globe.”</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been committed to developing worthwhile games for slot enthusiasts to enjoy. In fact, the company is currently producing five new titles a month, with Juicy Slots its latest contribution to the iGaming slot portfolio.</p>
