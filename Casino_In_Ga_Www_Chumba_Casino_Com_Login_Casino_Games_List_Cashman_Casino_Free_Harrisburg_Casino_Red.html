<p>The luxury integrated casino resort Red Rock Casino, Resort &amp; Spa, located off the Las Vegas Strip, is expanding its culinary array with a major makeover adding new venues, which will be offering exotic cuisine, a casino bar, cocktail lounge and an upgraded pool lounge.</p>
<p>Red Rock Expands with New Thai and Greek Restaurants</p>
<p>Red Rock Casino, Resort &amp; Spa is trying to up its game and compete with Las Vegas Strip behemoths such as Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts. The property, which is located in Summerlin, Las Vegas, is going through a major upgrade that will see an expansion of its culinary offering and other amenities.</p>
<p>A newly coined partnership with Bua Food Group is an integral part of the makeover of the casino’s 118,309 square foot space. Red Rock will become the third home of the topnotch Thai family restaurant Lotus of Siam, which will be the central piece of the luxurious upgrade of the property. The restaurant, which is expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022, will be located in the north part of the resort and together with other new bar and dining facilities will form a state-of-the-art food court.</p>
<p>Right next to the Lotus of Siam, the partnership with Bua Food Group will also bring a Greek restaurant focusing on traditional Greek seafood dishes. It will be called Naxos Taverna and is part of a new venture for the family-owned Thai restaurant company. In addition to the introduction of Greek cuisine, Bua Food Group will also bring an oyster bar to Red Rock. Its name will be Kallisto Oyster Bar and it will be located at the entrance of the Naxos Taverna. The bar will expand on the seafood offering of the taverna with an exclusive intimate atmosphere that can seat only 13 people.</p>
<p>The upgrade will also see a new casino bar, which will be squeezed in between the Lotus of Siam and Naxos Taverna. It will offer a respite to patrons looking to have a go at casino games together with a few drinks before dinner.</p>
<p>Red Rock will also host the first expansion of all-time favorite Nielsen’s Frozen Custard. The new venue will open in the beginning of 2023 with Nielsen’s usual high-quality frozen custard being made on site.</p>
<p>Red Rock Also Upscales Its Adults-Only Offering</p>
<p>In addition to the new dining options, Red Rock is upgrading its bar and lounge options. The resort is striving for a luxury feel with an upscaled cocktail lounge bar to open during the winter. It will see the former Crimson space, which was dedicated to events, transform into an intimate bar with a classical vibe to it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Red Rock will spoil its premium customers with an adults-only pool lounge. It will be housed at the former Crimson pool. It will be separate from the resort’s main pool, but premium visitors will have easy access to it from the main pool area.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be an upgrade to the High Limit Slot area, which will offer 73 games, a classy bar area serving cocktails and a dedicated cage.</p>
<p>The new venues will comprise a vibrant section of Red Rock, offering a unique and exotic culinary variety to guests in addition to the luxurious feel of the bar and lounge locations.</p>
