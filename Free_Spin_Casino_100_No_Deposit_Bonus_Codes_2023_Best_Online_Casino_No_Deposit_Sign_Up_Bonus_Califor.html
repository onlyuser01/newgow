<p>The new deal marks OpenBet's entry into Brazil, a move that comes ahead of the much-anticipated sports betting market launch in the country</p>
<p>The popular platform offering trading and risk, as well as content and services to operators within the sports betting sector, OpenBet, announced a new groundbreaking partnership. The company confirmed Monday it joined forces with the sports betting brand, Play7.Bet. The new major partnership marks OpenBet’s entry into Brazil and comes ahead of the sports betting market launch in the country.</p>
<p>Currently, the company has already established its presence as a leading provider of technology and solutions with operators across the globe. Under the terms of the new deal, OpenBet will power Play7.Bet’s operations by delivering its full stack of products and services.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, the operator will also leverage the platform provider’s versatile Betting Engine and Managed Trading Services. The aforementioned solutions are already renowned within the gambling sector for their scalability and unique capabilities, allowing operators to process huge volumes of wagers in different markets across the globe.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration will also see Play7.Bet leverage OpenBet’s Player Account Management (PAM) technology. The innovative PAM allows operators to create unique gaming experiences via promotions while at the same time providing options for responsible gambling and complying with anti-money laundering (AML) requirements.</p>
<p>Recently, OpenBet strengthened its AML capabilities after a deal with the fraud detection, AML and responsible gaming leader, Neccton. This strategic integration enabled the company to provide innovative sports betting technology backed by AI and cloud features that help protect the players.</p>
