<p>New York Jets Looking for Their Seventh Win of 2023</p>
<p>The Jets are 6-9, which is actually a great achievement for a team that lost its starting quarterback in the first game week. The former Green Bay Packers signal-caller Aaron Rodgers became a Jets player last summer, but he suffered a season-ending injury on his debut.</p>
<p>Without him, they haven’t been great offensively, averaging just 15.4 points per game. Zach Wilson was the starting QB in most of the Jets’ games this season, but in their last two games, Trevor Siemian was in his place.</p>
<p>He was dreadful against the Miami Dolphins, in which the Jets scored zero points. In the previous game, however, they defeated the Washington Commanders 30-28, with Siemian throwing for one TD.</p>
<p>Cleveland Browns to Secure Their Playoff Ticket</p>
<p>The Cleveland Browns are 10-5 right now, meaning that they just need to beat the Jets in the Thursday Night Football game to secure their spot in the Playoffs. Bookies think they’re going to pull it off, the No. 1 reason being that the Browns are in top shape at the moment.</p>
<p>They’re 3-0 in their last three games, defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears, and Houston Texans. The Bears currently have the same record as Cleveland’s next opponent, while both the Jaguars and the Texans are better than the Jets.</p>
<p>Another reason why the Browns are expected to have a relatively easy job in the TNF game is that it’s played on their turf. At home, they’re 7-1 in the 2023 season, with their only loss happening to the mighty Baltimore Ravens on the first day of October.</p>
<p>New York Jets vs. Cleveland Browns Prediction</p>
<p>The Browns are much, much better than the Jets when it comes to player quality. Their defense should have an easy job stopping Siemian and the Jets’ offense, while their offensive team should be able to score enough points to cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Cleveland Browns -7.0</p>
