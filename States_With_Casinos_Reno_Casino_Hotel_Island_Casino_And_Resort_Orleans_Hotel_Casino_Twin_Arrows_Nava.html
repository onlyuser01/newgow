<p>The leading online payment solutions provider AstroPay has strengthened its existing partnership with the British soccer club Burnley FC. The improved deal will cover the rest of the 2021/22 soccer season.</p>
<p>AstroPay Supports Burnley’s Women’s Team</p>
<p>The relationship between the two parties first began at the start of this year’s Premier League season when AstroPay became Burnley FC’s official sleeve sponsor. With the deal expanded, the provider will become the front shirt sponsor of the soccer club’s female team. The branding will be displayed both during home games and away games.</p>
<p>Other than appearing on the players’ jerseys, AstroPay will sponsor the club’s newly installed dugouts at Turf Moor. The payment company’s branding will be implemented on the new headrests as well as in the technical area.</p>
<p>Carl Sanderson, the head of business partnerships at Burnley FC said that he is thrilled to see the club strengthen its ties with AstroPay. With women’s soccer on the rise, Sanderson is excited to have secured backing for Burnley’s female team.</p>
<p>“The clubs are committed to growing the women’s game, as is demonstrated through exciting partnerships and sponsorships such as this,” he said.</p>
<p>Sanderson thanked AstroPay for their support and commitment. He said that he is glad by their decision to sponsor the dugouts and is looking forward to working closely with them.</p>
<p>AstroPay Is Glad To Continue Working With Burnley FC</p>
<p>Mikael Lijtenstein, the chief executive officer of AstroPay, spoke on the strengthened deal, revealing that the whole company’s team is happy to continue working with Burnley FC.</p>
<p>“As two innovative organizations, we share a similar ethos of being forward-thinking and creative, which is why the prospect of becoming Burnley FC Women’s front of shirt sponsor was so appealing. The club are making great strides in women’s football, and we wanted to be a part of the journey,” Lijtenstein explained.</p>
<p>He is sure that the partnership has a bright future ahead of itself and that by working together the two partners can achieve great things.</p>
