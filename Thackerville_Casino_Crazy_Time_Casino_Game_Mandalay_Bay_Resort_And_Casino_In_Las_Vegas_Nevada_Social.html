<p>Cleveland Browns Super Bowl Odds Slashed to 14/1 Following OBJ Trade Blockbuster</p>

<p>The Cleveland Browns are now at 14/1 to win the Super Bowl, down from 25/1 prior to the announcement of the team’s blockbuster trade for wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. from the New York Giants.</p>

<p>With the OBJ acquisition, the Browns become the AFC North favorites, and have the third-shortest odds of winning the AFC Championship at 7/1. Only the Kansas City Chiefs and defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots are shorter (3/1).</p>
<p>The Browns landing OBJ shocked the NFL world. The New York Post’s headline today reads: “OMG OBJ!”</p>
<p>The deal was a massive win for Cleveland. The Giants give up perhaps the best receiver in football for safety Jabrill Peppers, as well as the Browns’ first-round 2019 draft pick (No. 19 overall) and No. 95 pick in the third round.</p>
<p>As for the overhauled Super Bowl odds, the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas has the Pats and Chiefs the favorites at 6/1. They’re followed by the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints at 8/1, and then it’s the Green Bay Packers and Browns rounding out the top five at 14/1.</p>
<p>Fixing Mistake by the Lake</p>
<p>For a team that went 1-31 during the 2016 and 2017 seasons, the Browns rebuild has been unlike any other in recent NFL memory.</p>
<p>They drafted quarterback Baker Mayfield as the No. 1 pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, and the rookie led Cleveland to a 7-8-1 season, the franchise’s best campaign in more than a decade. They acquired superstar wideout Jarvis Landry from the Miami Dolphins, built a strong defense around defensive end Myles Garrett, and now add one of the game’s most prolific offensive weapons.</p>
<p>It’s also a seemingly perfect fit for OBJ, who had a contentious relationship with the Giants’ front office. Beckham joins former LSU teammate Landry in Cleveland. The duo spent three years together in Baton Rouge and are close friends. Beckham also enjoys a close friendship with Mayfield.</p>
<p>Together, Beckham and Landry have seven Pro Bowls to their resumes, nearly 900 receptions, over 10,000 receiving yards, and 70 touchdowns. And they’re both only 26-years-old.</p>
<p>Browns Past, Future</p>
<p>A year ago at this time, fresh off those 1-15 and 0-16 seasons, the Cleveland Browns were at 300/1 at the SuperBook to win the Super Bowl. That was worst in the entire league.</p>
<p>At 300/1, a $100 bet and the unlikeliest of scenarios coming true would have net the most fortunate of gamblers $30,000.</p>
<p>Mayfield’s strong play, paired with the Browns’ strong D, had the team in the playoff hunt in the second half of the year. They didn’t reach the postseason, but there was plenty of optimism surrounding the franchise heading into 2019 – and for the Browns, optimism hasn’t been a word used for many years.</p>
<p>Now, bettors who took Cleveland at 25/1 prior to the OBJ deal have some rather large potential payouts should the excitement lead to victories. At the pre-Beckham odds, a $100 bet would still net $2,500.</p>
<p>DraftKings reports that Cleveland is now the most bet upon team to win the Super Bowl both in terms of ticket count and money.</p>
