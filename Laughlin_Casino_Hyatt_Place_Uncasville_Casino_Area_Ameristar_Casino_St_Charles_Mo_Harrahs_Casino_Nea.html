<p>MaximBet Gets Access to Ohio and Pennsylvania as It Scales Up</p>
<p>Online sportsbook operator MaximBet has signed two new market-access partnerships in Ohio and Pennsylvania, marking two more jurisdictions in which the company will soon launch. Introduced by the namesake men’s magazine, the sportsbook is an attempt by the company to break into a new vertical.</p>
<p>Heading for the New States as MaximBet’s Operations Expand</p>
<p>MaximBet already broke ground in Colorado, where the company runs sports betting options, and previously, Maxim confirmed that it successfully negotiated a partnership with the White Mountain Apache Tribe in Arizona for the tribe’s Hon-Dah Resort-Casino.</p>
<p>🚨 Breaking News 🚨</p>
<p>It's official: MaximBet is coming to Ohio and Pennsylvania 🎉#BigTen country, here we come! pic.twitter.com/b8EQetO39F — MaximBet (@MaximBetUSA) September 14, 2021</p>
<p>The operator was established in April as a co-venture between the Carousel Group and the men’s magazine. Detailing the pending launches in Ohio and Pennsylvania, Maxim explained that the company was going to launch a fully mobile platform in Ohio.</p>
<p>As for Pennsylvania, the company has been able to negotiate a partnership with Caesars Entertainment and Harrah’s Philadelphia because of the Keystone State-specific requirement that any operator must be associated with a land-based casino.</p>
<p>As the Ohio and Pennsylvania market-access deals have been announced, MaximBet has already confirmed that the company is expanding its footprint in Indiana, Iowa, and New Jersey, marking ambitious new targets for its further expansion.</p>
<p>The sportsbook is planning to benefit from an extensive list of sports betting markets, including college betting in those states that authorize wagers on NCAAF and NCAAB events.</p>
<p>Join MaximBet for Money Can’t Buy Experiences</p>
<p>Commenting on these activations, MaximBet CEO Daniel Graetzer stated, “Every new market we enter, our sole focus is on bringing the best experience to the customer by providing them not only with a world-class sportsbook and casino but also with access to money-can’t-buy experiences that only a lifestyle brand can provide.”</p>
<p>He also confirmed that MaximBet has teamed up with strong partners in both states and that the company was looking to secure further similar arrangements in the future. Both states will present MaximBet with various challenges.</p>
<p>MaximBet will be vying against the likes of FanDuel, DraftKings and BetMGM in both markets. Early access to Ohio is important, as analysts put the Buckeye State’s sports betting value on par with the leading gambling markets in the country.</p>
<p>Ohio has a population of close to 12 million people, which means a lot of pent-up demand for sports betting. While MaximBet’s social media presence is still going slow, the company is confident in its future successes.</p>
