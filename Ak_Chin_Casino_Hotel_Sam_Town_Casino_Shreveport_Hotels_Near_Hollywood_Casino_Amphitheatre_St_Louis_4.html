<p>Bragg Gaming Group Inc. has announced its current president and chief operating officer, Lara Falzon, will resign from both positions, effective at the end of the year</p>
<p>NASDAQ-listed content-driven iGaming provider of technology that is catering to the needs of online and brick-and-mortar gaming operators with proprietary and exclusive content, Bragg Gaming Group Inc., has announced that it is getting ready to bid farewell to its current president and chief operating officer, Lara Falzon.</p>
<p>At the end of last week, Falzon officially communicated her decision to resign from both positions within the company that is currently licensed or certified, approved, and operating in a variety of global online casino markets.</p>
<p>The decision will go into effect starting December 31, 2023. Until then, Flazon will continue to remain involved in Bragg’s daily operations.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, Bragg announced it would expand its player account management agreement with Entain’s BetCity.nl brand.</p>
<p>“An Invaluable Member” of the Bragg Team</p>
<p>Flazon has spent two years and nine months with Bragg Gaming. Starting in March 2021, she has been a non-executive director within the company. In November 2021, she also took the position of president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>As explained by the company’s chairman and chief executive officer, Matevž Mazij, while fulfilling her job requirements and responsibilities as a board member and senior manager as president and COO, Flazon “has been an invaluable member” of the team.</p>
<p>Mazij also took the opportunity to describe her contributions to the company’s success and development as “substantial” while praising her impressive commitment, authority, and hard work which have all helped Bragg grow over the years.</p>
<p>In September, Bragg obtained a Gibraltar business-to-business remote gambling license, which represented a critical milestone complementing its worldwide expansion. The following month, the company announced inking a tailored hosting service deal with Internet Vikings for Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>While wishing Falzon “all the best for the next chapter in her career,” Mazij also expressed the company’s gratitude for having benefited from her know-how and expertise accumulated from her long history of working in the gambling and casino industries.</p>
<p>Falzon, “Honored” to Have Been Part of the Team</p>
<p>Falzon, who is skilled in a plethora of fields including accounting, budgeting, internal controls, external audit, and international financial reporting standards, explained she was honored to “have been of the Bragg team” at a time when the company progressed in setting its foundation for constant growth.</p>
<p>She also expressed her confidence in Bragg’s ability to use its “outstanding leadership and team members” to keep aiming at ongoing success.</p>
<p>Falzon also spent over a year with NetEnt as operational chief financial officer between February 2020 and April 2021, after she left her position as CFO for Red Tiger Gaming where she spent little over three years between April 2018 and April 2021.</p>
<p>Before that, she was a group CFO for Evoke Gaming Ltd as part of Bonnier AB as well as a financial controller and a group financial controller for King.</p>
