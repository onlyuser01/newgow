<p>Fast Track signs partnership with iGaming casino company Dunder for access to the Fast Track CRM tool intended at boosting engagement and player retention.</p>
<p>Dunder Becomes Latest Fast Track CRM Partner</p>
<p>Dunder has become the latest iGaming operator to sign up a partnership with Fast Track CRM tool in a bid to boost player engagement and retention. As per the terms of the partnerships, Fast Track will offer Dunder assistance in creating a customizable experience leading to better retention rates, the companies said in an official press release.</p>
<p>The CRM tool will allow Dunder to analyze real-time data and convert it into actionable solutions improving the overall “user lifecycle,” and leading to the issuance of targeted promotions and communications that specifically meet players’ preferences.</p>
<p>Fast Track CEO and co-founder Simon Lidzén commented on the partnership explaining that teaming up with innovative brands such as Dunder felt rewarding to the company’s inhouse team.</p>
<p>He said that adding accomplished operators allows Fast Track to see how far the tool can go and also obtain valuable feedback about future prospects and improvements:</p>
<p>“We anticipate that Dunder will be producing truly innovative player engagements once we are live.” Fast Track CEO Simon Lidzén</p>
<p>Through the partnership, Dunder expects to customize the experience to the point where each player enjoys a slightly different gameplay visiting the online casino. Even though Dunder has only been on the market for four years now, the company has quickly established itself as one of the biggest trend-setters in the iGaming space, owing to simple, mobile-friendly user interface.</p>
<p>Dunder CEO Thomas Rosander also gave a statement, praising Fast Track as a company that “truly understands the needs of operators” in the iGaming space and offers the means necessary to improve engagement strategies:</p>
<p>“Fast Track CRM is the only tool available that will allow us to work with CRM the same way we do in other aspects of our business.” Dunder CEO Thomas Rosander</p>
<p>Driving Retention and Engagement the Surest Ways to Success</p>
<p>Fast Track has been gaining popularity in the iGaming space with multiple partnerships struck with other established brands, including Hero Gaming, Alea and SuprNation. Each brand runs a host of online casinos.</p>
<p>Engagement and retention have been two of the biggest challenges that casinos face today. With players able to choose from hundreds of viable operators, each operator has been vying for market share, and customization has been a sure-fire to obtain better results.</p>
<p>A part of the retention conundrum is also solved by the provider by providing better quality games with more engaging features and better payouts.</p>
