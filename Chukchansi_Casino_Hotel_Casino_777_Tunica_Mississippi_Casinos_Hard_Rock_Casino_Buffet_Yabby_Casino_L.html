    <h1>Chukchansi Casino Hotel Casino 777 Tunica Mississippi Casinos Hard Rock Casino Buffet Yabby Casino L</h1>

<p>I won £1,000 but they voided and kept half of this as it was over the maximum winning allowed!</p>
<p>Million Vegas claimed they sent withdrawal of £500 as a ‘refund’ on 4th February.</p>
<p>After repeated chasing on Live Chat and being told I’d get money soon they then claimed that money had been sent and I needed to ask bank for chargeback!</p>
<p>This seems to be a tactic they use regularly judging by comment on here and various reviews on Trust Pilot.</p>
<p>Bank have requested I provide them with an Acquirer Reference Number (ARN) to</p>
<p>proceed with this ridiculous claim but Million Vegas were unable to provide this.</p>
<p>Countless emails sent are never answered.</p>
<p>It seems casino sites based in Curaçao do not pay out winnings.</p>
