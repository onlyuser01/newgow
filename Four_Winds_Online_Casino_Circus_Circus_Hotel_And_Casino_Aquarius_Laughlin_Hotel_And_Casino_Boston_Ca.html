    <h1>Four Winds Online Casino Circus Circus Hotel And Casino Aquarius Laughlin Hotel And Casino Boston Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Ajay,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked carefully the T&amp;Cs and this is what I found https://slotsnbets.com/templates/company/terms_and_conditions:</p>
<p>"Your Account must be registered in Your own, correct, name and personal details and it shall only be issued once for You and not duplicated through any other person, family, household, address (postal or IP), email address, Access Device or any environment where Access Devices are shared (e.g. schools, workplaces, public libraries etc.) and/or account in respect of the Services. Any other accounts which You open with us, or which are beneficially owned by You in relation to the Services shall be "Duplicate Accounts". You may open only one Account. Should we identify any customer with more than one account, we reserve the right to close those Duplicate Accounts. Should we close a Duplicate Account:</p>
<p>We may, at our discretion, void all winnings and refund all deposits (less amounts in respect of void winnings) made in respect of any Duplicate Account and, to the extent not recovered by us from the relevant Duplicate Account, any amounts to be refunded to us by You in respect of a Duplicate Account may be recovered by us directly from any other of Your Accounts (including any other Duplicate Account)"</p>
<p>COLLUSION, CHEATING, FRAUD AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</p>
<p>"The following practices (or any of them) in relation to the Services:</p>
<p>abuse of bonuses or other promotions; and/or using unfair external factors or influences (commonly known as cheating); and/or taking unfair advantage (as defined in paragraph 9.5.3); opening any Duplicate Accounts; and/or undertaking fraudulent practice or criminal activity (as defined in paragraph 9.5), constitute "Prohibited Practices" are not permitted and will constitute a material breach of the Terms &amp; Conditions. We will take all reasonable steps to prevent and detect such practices and to identify the relevant players concerned if they do occur. Subject to the above, however, we will not be liable for any loss or damage which You may incur as a result of any Prohibited Practices, and any action we take in respect of the same will be at our sole discretion."</p>
<p>It means that if you have lost your previous deposits while having multiple accounts, you might be entitled to a refund of the last deposit only.</p>
<p>Please understand, that it is strictly forbidden, in the majority of the casinos, to have more than one account. As you admitted, you have opened more than one account from the same IP address. This has been recognized by the casino as breaching T&amp;Cs and your account blocked.</p>
<p>Could you please advise what was the reason to open a brand new account?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
