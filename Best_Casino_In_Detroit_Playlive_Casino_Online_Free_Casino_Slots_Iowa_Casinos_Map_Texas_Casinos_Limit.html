    <h1>Best Casino In Detroit Playlive Casino Online Free Casino Slots Iowa Casinos Map Texas Casinos Limit</h1>

<p>Jesus I don't even know where to start. Ice been using the site for probably a year. I've actually but it pretty big once or twice once for 1300$ and recently got up to like 600$. That's where the problems started. I've deposited probably 1000+do over the last 12 months and never withdrawn. So I used a bonus on a 50$ deposit and got up to almost 700$. Got through the rediculous party through requirement of like 3000$ with that 700 interact. My account reflected no more playthrough requirement. The second that I didn't have a pattern requirement, bam, 290$ gone off the top. Down to like 300 and change. So I started talking to customer service and checked my transaction history, which showed no 290 withdrawal and at that point my account had not been verified so I couldn't have withdrawn any funds anyways, it was obviously them screwing with the balance. Every time I tried to chat with customer service they instantly closed the chat instantly with no response. While this is happening I all the sudden can't access the account or the webpage for a good hour, kept getting routed to an error page at cloudflare saying the site was timing out and/or down. When it finally lets me back on my balance is zero, and the my transaction history does show a withdrawal at this point for the remainder I had left after the 290$ disappeared. I loved of for a week in disgust after emailing them that they are scamming POS. A week later I log back on and my balance is magically like 350 bucks again. So screw it I thought I'll withdrawal what is there now. Now enter verification purgatory. Took like two weeks and several resubmissions. Finally get that done and am at like 260 bucks after playing a bit. So I start trying to withdrawal now that I'm verified. Mind you I have 0 playthrough or bonus obligations but every single time they kick back my withdrawal request saying I have a remaining playthrough balance of like 120 bucks. So even through the cashier screen showed nothing of the sort I pay through 120 bucks and win some more back up to 300$. Now that they can't say shit about a playthrough they start kicking back my requests telling me my max withdrawal amount is 50 measley fucking dollars and poof, all the sudden my 361 dollars balance is 50 bucks. They have some nonsense bullshit about why it was that and I just took it and will never play it again.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a fucking sham, a scam, complete bullshit. Will never play again and if you're smart you will stay away from this site they are fake as fuck and out to screw you.</p>
