<p>The Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos are the two teams that have scored the fewest number of points in the AFC. The Colts have the worst offense in the conference, which is averaging just 14.25 points per game. The Broncos are only slightly better with 16.5 PPG.</p>
<p>The reason why this is surprising is that both teams have some really amazing players in their offensive teams. The Colts’ quarterback is Matt Ryan, a 37-year-old veteran who’s been playing in the NFL since the 2008 season. They also have one of the best running backs in the league playing for them – Jonathan Taylor – as well as many other excellent players.</p>
<p>Over in Denver, the Broncos are led by legendary Russell Wilson, who’s one of the highest-paid athletes in the world. Still, the guy just hasn’t been good since moving to his new team.</p>

<p>Indianapolis Colts Offense Needs to Step Up</p>
<p>The Colts just aren’t doing great in the offense and the worst thing is that it doesn’t seem likely they’re going to improve their stats in Week 5. The thing is that their arguably best offensive player is struggling with an injury. The man in question is RB Jonathan Taylor.</p>
<p>Jonathan Taylor said his ankle was “tweaked up a little bit, but feeling good now.”</p>
<p>On early status for TNF in Denver: “I’m not sure yet, but we’ll see how things are tomorrow morning. @WISH_TV pic.twitter.com/7zIpeLkskI — Charlie Clifford (@cliffWISH8) October 2, 2022</p>
<p>The running back suffered an injury last weekend against Tennessee, but he will probably be fit to start in Game 5. Still, he might not be 100% fit on Thursday night. With him not being at his best, the Colts will have to focus more on their passing game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for their fans, their passing has been abysmal in 2022. Quarterback Matt Ryan has thrown for 1,125 yards and five touchdowns in four games, along with five interceptions.</p>
<p>Russell Wilson Needs to Up His Game</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos lost to the Las Vegas Raiders last weekend 32-23. That was their best offensive display of the 2022 season, which shows how embarrassing they’ve been so far. On the bright side, Russell Wilson had an okay game, throwing two touchdowns and scoring one rushing TD on his own.</p>
<p>He will have to do even better in the TNF game for his team to beat the Colts. The reason is that both of the Broncos starting RBs suffered an injury last weekend – Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams.</p>
<p>Indianapolis Colts vs Denver Broncos Prediction</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos should win on Thursday night, but it won’t be an easy win. In fact, we’ll probably see them win by just a field goal or so.</p>
<p>Picks: Denver Broncos to win but not cover the spread; under to hit</p>
