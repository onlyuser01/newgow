<p>Well, you should probably read these instructions first.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>How long will it all take?</p>
<p>The time elapsed between submitting a complaint and the complaint being closed varies greatly. The complaints processed most quickly are those that can be resolved without getting the casino involved or those that are rejected because the casino has not done anything wrong. Other complaints, however, can be very time-consuming.</p>
<p>Here are some rough estimates and time-related information about complaints:</p>
<p>You will get your first response from our complaint team within 48 hours, but we do our best to respond within 12 to 24 hours.</p>
<p>Each involved party (you, the casino, or the Casino Guru team) has seven days to respond when they are required to do so to move the complaint forward. When this period elapses without a response, we usually choose to prolong the time limit by another seven days.</p>
<p>As the successful resolution of a complaint often takes a lot of communication between all three parties, the total time can add up. The average time it takes to close successfully-resolved complaints is roughly 21 days from the date they were submitted, but again, this varies a lot from one complaint to another.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>The Team has five days to respond, you see? Kindly wait for now:</p>

<p>Next time, I would try to avoid casinos with a low safety index. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Especially with this warning:</p>
<p>Very high value of withheld winnings in player complaints in relation to the casino's size</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Let's hope the complaint will work.üôè</p>
