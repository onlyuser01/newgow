<p>An Atari Hotels spokesperson who teased that the developer is currently on the lookout for a suitable 5-to-7-acre site near the Strip</p>
<p>Atari’s Las Vegas hotel might become a reality this year, according to reports. The planned Las Vegas property was first proposed in 2020 and will be one of the first locations for what Atari hopes to become a chain of branded hotels.</p>
<p>GSD Group, the company behind the Atari-branded hotels project, provided renderings of the Las Vegas back in 2020, announcing that the property will sport some 400 rooms and will occupy a 5-to-7-acre site near the famed Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>The group originally hoped to open the hotel by the end of 2022. However, these plans never came to fruition and, since the release of the initial renderings, the developer has been more or less silent on the matter.</p>
<p>However, an Atari-branded hotel might be on the table for 2024, it seems. The Las Vegas Review-Journal just spoke with an Atari Hotels spokesperson who teased that the developer is currently on the lookout for a suitable 5-to-7-acre site near the Strip. In an email, the spokesperson told the news outlet that the matter is currently being discussed with partners.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the website for the Atari-branded hotel project also remains live, teasing at the possibility of such a property becoming a reality very soon. More news will likely be shared in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Atari Wants to Build Hotels in a Number of US Cities</p>
<p>Atari’s plan for a chain of hotels also includes plans for properties in seven other cities across the United States. The company already has renderings for some of these properties, although the COVID pandemic prevented it from proceeding with any of them.</p>
<p>The company’s goal is to launch a trend-setting chain of modern hotels offering unparalleled hospitality experiences inspired by video gaming culture. While Atari never quite managed to catch up to its video gaming competitors, such as Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, the company still holds a special place in the hearts of many people who grew up with its games.</p>
<p>The plans for a chain of hotels demonstrate Atari’s desire to expand into other sectors while maintaining its fondness for video gaming.</p>
