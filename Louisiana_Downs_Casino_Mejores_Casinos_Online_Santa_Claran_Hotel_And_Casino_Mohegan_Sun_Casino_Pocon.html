<p>Crypto gaming and sports betting operator Cloudbet has introduced its most significant overall update to date, adding new functionalities and improving on the service’s interface and navigation.</p>
<p>Cloudbet, a provider of sports betting and iGaming solutions, has introduced a major overhaul to its website, offering new visuals, user experience and functionalities. Cloudbet used the opportunity to add more languages as well as feature in-play esports betting markets, and more.</p>
<p>The company launched back in 2013 and became one of the first bitcoin and blockchain-casinos focused on iGaming. Prior to the rollout of its most significant website update, Cloudbet offered the product as a beta, using customers’ feedback to update the offer to a more customer-oriented experience moving forward.</p>
<p>The update features a number of essential improvements, such as up to four times quicker loading times on mobile devices. Cloudbet’s product will now also offer a Quick-bet slip adding a more intuitive way to place wagers.</p>
<p>A major update was introduced in the esports markets, featuring over 60 live-streamed competitions across a number of leading esports competitions, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends and Dota 2.</p>
<p>Meet the newly revamped Cloudbet!</p>
<p>It features a new quick-bet slip, faster load times on mobile devices, multi-currency options and is available in over 12 languages.</p>

<p>The shift towards esports has been the result of most other sports currently on hold due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Language options have also been touched up with Cloudbet now available in Italian, Spanish and German, although no mention about whether this covers customer support or just the user interface.</p>
<p>More Cryptocurrencies and Better Interface</p>
<p>Cloudbet introduced Ethereum (ETH) as the latest viable cryptocurrency option on the casino, promising more solutions to follow. On-site bitcoin purchases have also been simplified to boost onboarding and attract FIAT currency users.</p>
<p>The company has also worked out a better, improved and intuitive navigation. Commenting on this development, a spokesperson had this to say:</p>
<p>“We’ve set out to build the most impressive betting service the world has ever seen. It provides the foundation for the exciting new products and features that the industry will see in the coming years.”</p>
<p>Cloudbet will extend support for its legacy website, but the company has cautioned that it will phase it out eventually. Players may still access the older version of the website if they prefer to.</p>
