<p>Gaming Laboratories International (GLI), a provider of high-quality land-based, lottery, and iGaming testing and assessment services, announced that it has been approved as an Independent Test Lab in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Having been greenlit by the NC State Lottery Commission, GLI now has authorization to evaluate gambling equipment, software and processes for compliance with state law and commission rules.</p>
<p>This approval further expands the company’s presence in the US, cementing it as a leading test lab. For reference, GLI is an authorized test lab for 65 lotteries and for 707 markets across the world. The company excels in a variety of compliance-related services, including regulatory compliance, technical compliance, end-to-end testing and full lifecycle compliance.</p>
<p>GLI’s latest approval was praised by the company’s vice president of global lottery solutions, Angela Wong. She expressed her team’s excitement saying that GLI is thrilled to be approved to test and certify for the North Carolina State Lottery Commission.</p>
<p>Our testing and consultation services are unmatched because we combine innovation with compliance and a global reach and presence that gives our clients a world of insight. Angela Wong, VP of global lottery solutions, GLI</p>

<p>In other news, GLI recently secured accreditation for its testing laboratories in India and Canada. This followed accreditation to the ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standard from the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA).</p>
<p>Back then, GLI said that this accreditation attests to its ongoing commitment to the highest possible quality testing services. For reference, all of the testing specialist’s labs are currently operating under the latest requirements of ISO/IEC 17025:2017.</p>
