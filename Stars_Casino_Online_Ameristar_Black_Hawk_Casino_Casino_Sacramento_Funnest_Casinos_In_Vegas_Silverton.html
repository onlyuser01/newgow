<p>Global gaming tech developer Playtech has expanded its existing agreement with the British bingo and slots operator Buzz Bingo. The provider has now armed Buzz Bingo with a single wallet solution.</p>
<p>The Solution Allows Players to Play Retail and Online</p>
<p>Playtech’s single wallet tech will create a universal way for customers to add money to their Buzz Bingo accounts. Players can fuel their wallets by visiting a Buzz Bingo shop or depositing online. Once a customer’s account is funded, they can use their money both in retail shops, as well as on the operator’s online platform. Moreover, the single wallet solution allows customers to withdraw their winnings at any Buzz Bingo shop.</p>
<p>The single wallet tech is powered by Playtech’s renowned information management solution platform and is a great quality-of-life addition to Buzz Bingo. This cross-channel approach not only allows players to be more flexible but will also help Buzz Bingo to manage its customers, thanks to Playtech’s Engagement Center tools.</p>
<p>A Major Achievement for Both Companies</p>
<p>Buzz Bingo’s director of digital operations, David Evans, shared he considers Playtech as a “vital partner” to his company. He mentioned that the tech provider has been a crucial partner of the slots and bingo operator since day one and is a valued ally. Evans said that the addition of a single wallet solution across Buzz Bingo’s entire retail estate and online presence is an event the importance of which cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Evans added that the partnership has helped Buzz Bingo go above and beyond.</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of highly challenging times with long-term club closures during the Covid-19 pandemic, our partnership has created something truly ground-breaking. David Evans, director of digital operations, Buzz Bingo</p>
<p>Playtech’s VP of interactive gaming, Marat Koss, also shared his thoughts about the matter. He confirmed that the launch of Playtech’s single wallet solution on Buzz Bingo’s retail and online platforms is a major achievement for both companies.</p>
<p>Koss admitted that achieving seamless single wallet connectivity was no easy task. Still, thanks to the incredible work from both companies’ teams, Buzz Bingo’s products are now connected by a universal payment system.</p>
<p>We are very proud to be part of delivering an enhanced experience for players across every Buzz club and Buzz Bingo online. Marat Koss, VP interactive gaming, Playtech</p>
<p>A month ago, Playtech joined forces with 888 to explore new opportunities in the United States. At that time, the provider agreed to power the renowned operator with its dedicated iGaming portfolio.</p>
