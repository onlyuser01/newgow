<p>Entain, an international sports betting and gambling company, has reinforced its board of directors with the addition of Rahul Welde. He will be joining the company as an independent non-executive director.</p>
<p>Welde Has 31 Years of Experience as Part of Unilever</p>
<p>Welde is an experienced and loyal worker who has served the global business brand Unilever for over 31 years. He joined as a management trainee back in June 1991 and has worked for the company ever since.</p>
<p>Welde’s time in Unilever has seen him take various positions within the company. In 1993, he became Unilever’s factory commercial manager for tea exports. Two years later, Welde was promoted to regional commercial manager. In another two years, the employee rose to the position of a sales and operation manager which he maintained for another two years.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the new millennia, Welde became Unilever’s business manager of popular foods – a position he maintained for almost three years. Following that, he became executive assistant of the chairman. After assisting the chairman for two years and a half, Welde rose as the media director of Unilever South Asia.</p>
<p>Welde’s longest-term service was as vice president of media – a role he served for more than eight years. This was followed by two years as global VP of digital transformations and four years as EVP of digital transformation. Welde’s latest position at Unilever is EVP of digital business.</p>
<p>Welde Will Help Entain Grow</p>
<p>Welde will join Entain’s board on July 1. His experience will play a key role in propelling the company forward. In addition to joining the board, he will also join the company’s Environmental, Social and Governance Committee.</p>
<p>Barry Gibson, the chairman of Entain’s board, welcomed Welde to the board. He also noted that the new appointee’s excellence will be of great help to the company, citing Welde’s knowledge of customer experience, ecommerce and digital transformation as major benefits to Entain. Gibson is certain that the new non-exec director will live up to the expectations he has for him.</p>
<p>I am confident that his skills and expertise will further enhance the board’s ability to support and oversee the delivery of our strategy. Barry Gibson, chairman, Entain</p>
<p>In other news, a few days ago, Entain helped Relax Gaming, an award-winning B2B gambling products provider, launch in the strict Spanish gambling market.</p>
<p>Last week, Entain announced that it will be acquiring the online sports betting and gaming brand BetCity and using it to establish a presence in the Dutch market.</p>
