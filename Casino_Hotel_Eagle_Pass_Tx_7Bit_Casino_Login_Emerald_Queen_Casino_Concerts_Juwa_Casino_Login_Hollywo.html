<p>Global Sportsbook leader bet365 has signed a content deal with software developer Nolimit City. The new agreement will transfer Nolimit City’s top-tier gaming content to bet365’s gaming vertical. Bet365 wishes to add even more versatility to its portfolio of games by including another big name in its list of reputable software providers. At the same time, Nolimit City, which was acquired by Evolution for $210.4 million in June, has expressed its “immense pride and jubilation” for the new partnership.</p>
<p>bet365 Is Getting Ready to Grow Its Market Share</p>
<p>bet365 is a top global online sports betting company with headquarters in Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire. The company was founded in 2000 and currently coordinates more than 6,000 employees catering to the needs of 80+ million customers located in all parts of the world. The brand that is known as the pioneer of In-Play betting is constantly focusing on offering consistent sports products together with excellent content for its Poker, Games, and Casino verticals. The new partnership with Nolimit City is expected to help it further increase its brand visibility while growing its market share.</p>
<p>bet365 also streams more than 600,000 live events on a yearly basis for hundreds of different In-Play markets. Its services are available in more than 20 languages. The company takes responsible gaming seriously, offering players a series of dedicated tools to help them stay in full control of their gambling.</p>
<p>bet365 used the voice of its spokesperson to express excitement for welcoming Nolimit City into its “portfolio of innovative and cutting-edge gaming content partners”. The same spokesperson called the partnership “a great git” into their exclusive Games vertical thanks to the innovative in-game slot features that the award-winning supplier is known for.</p>
<p>Nolimit City, the One-Stop-Shop for Partners</p>
<p>The casino platform has headquarters in Stockholm, Malta, and India and provides top-tier gaming content and solutions to global operators. Now, the supplier is ready to offer its highly flexible one-stop-shop solutions to bet365, while carefully catering to its individual needs and requirements. The company works with some of the most talented people in the industry and it is responsible for creating a portfolio packed with highly engaging titles.</p>
<p>Nolimit City’s chief commercial officer and managing director Malcolm Mizzi said the company was “left lost for words” at the news of the partnership going through. Mizzi called the agreement with bet365, a “leading household name in the world of betting”, something that proves their growth over the years. In mid-June, SkillOnNet decided to add Nolimit City’s games to its own portfolio as part of a newly signed agreement.</p>
