<p>EGT Digital has announced that it is further expanding its footprint in Europe, after the supplier has successfully teamed up with merkurxtip.rs, an operator based in Serbia. The company will now be able to provide the established casino brand with a range of experiences, including its Single Progressive Jackpot series and Bell Link and High Cash, among other titles.</p>
<p>EGT Digital is a Bulgarian-based company which has been steadily building up its presence in the iGaming industry. EGT Digital provides a long range of titles that the company has been developing in its own signature style, including 40 Zodiac Wheel Bell Link, 100 Burning Hot, Emperor’s Palace, 10 Crystal Wish, Tropical Beauties and many more.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, MerkurXtip Head of Online Business Nenad Aleksić has welcomed the opportunity to work closely with EGT Digital and help the esteemed supplier enter the Serbian iGaming market for the very first time.</p>
<p>"Anticipating similar positive results, I foresee the upcoming integration of the remaining games from the provider’s portfolio, which we plan to do shortly," Aleksić added. EGT Digital Head of Sales Tsvetomira Drumeva was equally excited about the opportunity and welcomed the chance to see the company enter yet another market and provide its established products to local audiences.</p>
<p>"I believe that this is just the beginning of a steady streak of success for our company in the region as a whole," Drumeva said confident in the future of EGT Digital in Serbia and with its new partnership opportunity.</p>
<p>Serbia has been an interesting market for operators globally as well as suppliers. As a matter of fact, there have been several prominent market entries over the past years. CT Interactive is one of the companies that has recently expanded into both Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
<p>Swintt, another prominent supplier, has also made waves in the Serbian market, offering its products to AdmiralBet, a local operator with an established presence. As to EGT Digital’s own product, the company has not yet talked about any other potential rollouts, but it’s possible that more will be coming in the next weeks and months.</p>
