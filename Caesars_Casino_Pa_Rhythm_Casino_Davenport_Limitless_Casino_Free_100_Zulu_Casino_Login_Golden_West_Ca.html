<p>Millionaire playboy Dan Bilzerian bet an estimated $1 million against McGregor in his recent fight against Cerrone.</p>
<p>Bilzerian Bet “Pocket Change” Against McGregor</p>
<p>Dan Bilzerian is a playboy millionaire and poker player, known for his crazy antics in the gaming world and beyond. This time, he’s found himself in a tight situation, after losing an estimated $1 million for betting against Conor McGregor in last night’s fight against Donald Cerrone.</p>
<p>Before the fight, he posted on Instagram that he would be betting against McGregor. In true Bilzerian style, he called the seven-figure sum “pocket change”:</p>
<p>Going into the fight, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that McGregor was the favourite. Leading up to the event, the odds of McGregor winning were 2/7 while Cerrone’s were just 13/5. There was also the slight chance that he would win by decision with odds of 23/100 – but, that did not turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>It was just 40 seconds into the fight that McGregor landed a technical knockout. While this does sound incredibly quick, it’s fast from the fastest KO in UFC history. Ryan Jimmo, Chan Sung Jung and Todd Duffee all downed their opponents in 7 seconds.</p>
<p>While Bilzerian is $1 million down, McGregor is laughing all the way to the bank. It is estimated that he earned $80 million from this fight, and that he will become a millionaire before he turns 35.</p>
<p>Bilzerian’s Big Betting History</p>
<p>Bilzerian is well-known for making huge, risky bets – and even announced he might run for president. Since he found his place in the public eye, the millionaire has made some impressive wagers. Whether it’s betting on sports or events in his own life, he’s made bets worth millions and more.</p>
<p>In 2015, Bilzerian nearly bet $2 million on Floyd Mayweather to beat Manny Pacquiao. He backed out at the last minute, missing out a huge sum of money – but learned his lesson two years later when Mayweather faced off against McGregor. He bet on Mayweather to win and, while he didn’t state how much he wagered, Bilzerian revealed that he won over $340,000.</p>
<p>His most famous wager came in 2016, when he biked 270 miles from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in less than two days. He bet against Bill Perkins, who believed that no one would be able to make such a journey. Since he managed complete the trip is 33 hours, he won a tidy sum worth $600,000.</p>
<p>So, this is just the latest in a long line of exciting wagers from Dan Bilzerian. It will be interesting to see which sporting events he bets big on next.</p>
