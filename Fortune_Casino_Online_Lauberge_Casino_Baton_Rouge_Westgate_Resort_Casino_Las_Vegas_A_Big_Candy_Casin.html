    <h1>Fortune Casino Online Lauberge Casino Baton Rouge Westgate Resort Casino Las Vegas A Big Candy Casin</h1>

<p>Dear koisomakoto,</p>
<p>To be honest, under normal circumstances, such a complaint would have been closed as 'unresolved' a few weeks ago. The reason for keeping it open is the casino's rating/reputation and the disputed amount. If we closed it as 'unresolved', the casino rating would be completely destroyed. There has been no progress since the casino was invited to the thread, and now it is more than 1.5 months, but we do not know the details yet.</p>
<p>There are 3 options to proceed further, but all will require your patience.</p>
<p>Complaint closure as 'unresolved' with a recommendation to submit a complaint to the regulator - a significant influence on the casino's rating. Temporary closure of the complaint as 'unresolved', but with a note that the complaint was submitted to the regulator (after your confirmation), and we are waiting for its final decision - no penalization, then reopening of the case in a reasonable time, and reviewing the regulator's decision as well as the complaint again on our side. However, this could take a long anyway since we cannot influence the regulator's investigation and processes, and the regulator likely cannot influence the processes on the casino's side. Keeping the complaint open - although the casino's rating would not be influenced during this time, and it also could take longer, the casino would be at least forced to regularly check it, and try to resolve it as soon as possible because complaint closure in your favour would mean a huge decrease in its rating.</p>
<p>From our point of view, and to the satisfaction of all parties involved, I lean toward the third option, or a combination of options 2 and 3.</p>
<p>For now, unfortunately, we do not know enough to say something for sure, and only our patience is needed. Based on the fact we are talking about a high disputed amount, there is likely a rich gaming history in your account that has to be completely reviewed by the casino. Unless you did not breach any of the casino's Terms and Conditions, I sincerely think that the disputed funds of such an amount are worth the time we can devote to it. Anyway, if you feel it might help speed up the process, I fully agree with you in the meantime submitting a complaint directly to the regulator (MGA) and involving them in resolving your issue.</p>
<p>Do you please agree with my recommendation (option 3) - to leave the complaint open while you will also contact the regulator? If yes, are you going to file a complaint to the MGA, and do you know how? Will you need any help or assistance in submitting the complaint to the regulator?</p>
