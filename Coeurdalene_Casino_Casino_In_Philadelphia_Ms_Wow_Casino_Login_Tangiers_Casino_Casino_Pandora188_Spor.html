<p>Sporting Solutions and Stats Perform have entered an exciting new data partnership, powered by the latter’s recent data deal with the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA). Sporting Solutions will provide automated in-play pricing and risk management software for over 80 WTA tournaments every year.</p>
<p>Promising WTA Data Partnership</p>
<p>Award-winning risk management software provider Sporting Solutions has entered a new data agreement with Chicago-based sports data and analytics leader Stats Perform. Through the deal, Sporting Solutions will provide fully automated in-play pricing for over 80 Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) tournaments annually. Furthermore, the company will also supply high-end risk management tools to control pay-out rates, prices for players, and operational costs.</p>
<p>This exciting new deal was made possible by Stats Perform’s recent partnership with the WTA. The company will collect detailed data feeds and statistics from the WTA’s 2021-2026 tour and use it to enhance the broadcasting range and betting opportunities. In fact, Stats Perform has already leveraged the partnership for a real-time in-play data deal with GVC Holdings.</p>
<p>Companies Excited for Opportunities and Innovation</p>
<p>Sporting Solutions Managing Director Ed Peace is confident in the success of the partnership. He noted that the WTA tennis tour was a must-have offering of significant importance due to its high profile and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Mr. Peace also said that Sporting Solutions already used the most advanced tennis models on the market, which complements Stats Perform’s advanced data feeds. In regard to the partnership, Mr. Peace said he was excited to explore and deliver new and innovative betting experiences to drive up growth for the company’s partners.</p>
<p>Stats Perform Senior Vice President for B2B and Strategic Partnerships Shane Gannon lauded Sporting Solutions and its many strong qualities. He stressed that Sporting Solutions was a high-caliber and progressively-minded supplier with a reputation for innovation. Mr. Gannon remarked that Stats Perform was delighted, though not surprised, that Sporting Solutions immediately recognized the inherent value of the partnership with the WTA.</p>
<p>A Year of Many Partnerships</p>
<p>Sporting Solutions and Stats Perform already cooperate on a number of other international projects. This includes, but is not limited to, the Spanish La Liga, French Ligue 1, and North American Major League soccer.</p>
<p>Both companies entered a number of other exciting new partnerships this year. For Stats Perform, this is the third high-profile partnership this month alone. Most recently, Stats Perform struck a 10-year distribution partnership with the European Handball Federation (EHF). Only a week prior to this, the analytics provider also acquired Thuuz Sports’ powerful AI-driven platforms.</p>
<p>Sporting Solutions, on the other hand, has made a significant step towards entering the North American sports betting market. Earlier this year, the software provider partnered up with Las Vegas-based gaming consultancy SCCG Management.</p>
