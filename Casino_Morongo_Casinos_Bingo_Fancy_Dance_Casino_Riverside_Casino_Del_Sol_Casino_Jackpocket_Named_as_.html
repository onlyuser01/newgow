    <h1>Casino Morongo Casinos Bingo Fancy Dance Casino Riverside Casino Del Sol Casino Jackpocket Named as</h1>

<p>Jackpocket, a third-party lottery tickets app, was named as the exclusive sponsor of the ESPN New York sports app.</p>
<p>ESPN NY Welcomes Jackpocket</p>
<p>ESPN New York is a famous provider of New York sports news and content. Therefore, the partnership will help Jackpocket expand its footprint in the state. In addition, ESPN New York will provide Jackpocket with access to certain VIP events.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ESPN New York will leverage its presence in the state to promote Jackpocket to the local sports community. Famous sports personalities, including Rick Dipietro, Michael Kay and Peter Rosenberg will talk about Jackpocket and recommend it to sports and lottery enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Lastly, Jackpocket’s branding will be featured on ESPN New York’s app. A special Jackpocket button will allow fans to instantly download the famed lottery app.</p>
<p>According to Jackpocket’s official announcement, this deal is the company’s largest sports broadcasting promotion after the deals with the New York Jets NFL franchise and the New York Mets MLB franchise.</p>
<p>Jackpocket Recognizes ESPN NY’s Influence</p>
<p>Vinny DiMarco, market manager of ESPN New York, spoke about the new deal. He said that his whole team is looking forward to working together with Jackpocket. DiMarco described the partnership as “an intersection of sports and gaming” and believes it will provide unique content for both apps’ fans. DiMarco hopes that this is the beginning of a long-term partnership between the two companies.</p>
<p>We are excited to partner with Jackpocket. Adding the Jackpocket tile to the ESPN New York App creates an intersection of sports and gaming, while providing a unique and convenient way to serve our fans. Vinny DiMarco, market manager, ESPN NY</p>
<p>Peter Sullivan, the founder and chief executive officer of Jackpocket, also shared his thoughts. According to him, the partnership with ESPN New York comes at just the right time – right as the summer season heats up. He praised ESPN as a notable brand that always caters to its fans’ needs.</p>
<p>ESPN is an iconic brand, and their popularity in the tri-state area is something local fans always rely on for the best and most thorough coverage of New York’s famed sports teams. Peter Sullivan, CEO, Jackpocket</p>
<p>A month ago, Jackpocket added a new vice president of interactive gaming to its team. The one who joined the company was the experienced John Worthington whose job will be to help Jackpocket foray into iGaming. A few days prior to that, Jackpocket expanded its presence by launching its lottery app in the state of Montana.</p>
