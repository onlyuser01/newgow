<p>Picking a great betting site that accepts wagers on League of Legends can definitely be a little overwhelming at first. Players who wager on the game frequently find it easier to pick a website, but the rest are often in doubt about which one to choose.</p>
<p>That is why we have reviewed betting sites according to popular esports fans’ preferences and industry standards to provide you with only the top LoL gambling sites. Here, we will offer you a list of each aspect we have reviewed.</p>
<p>Variety of LoL Bets Available</p>
<p>Because of how big League of Legends is, we can hardly imagine an esports betting site that doesn’t feature virtually every franchised league and competition. Whether it’s the Mid-Season Invitation, the LCS, LCK, LEC, LPL, or the Worlds, you need to know that the LoL betting site is capable of delivering around the clock.</p>
<p>There are games on the daily, and while you are not very likely to bet on every League of Legends game, having the opportunity to do so when you spot a valuable position is definitely to your benefit. That is why we make abundantly sure that the esports betting sites we list here are capable of delivering the necessary value-betting opportunities we know you would appreciate.</p>
<p>Great User Interface and Navigation</p>
<p>Esports fans are a tech-savvy lot, and as such, they expect to be treated with respect. You will find numerous examples of bad UI and UX out there, but the best betting sites, i.e. those we recommend, have optimized their navigation to be an accommodating experience for any type of esports pro.</p>
<p>Essentially, LoL fans want to have a quick and easy time placing their wager on any League of Legends game, and that is precisely why betting companies such as BetOnline, BetUS, and Bovada are successful. They create compelling user interfaces that make it easy for LoL fans to feel a part of the action and navigate to the bets they want to place.</p>
<p>Frictionless Deposits and Withdrawals</p>
<p>Esports enthusiasts are not people who will settle for mistakes, and so, any LoL betting site we recommend will come with spot-on banking. You will be able to enjoy quick deposits and withdrawals using intuitive payment methods such as e-wallets, bank cards, bank transfers, and even cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Payments are important to most League of Legends players as they want to place a bet quickly and not have to wait long to collect their winnings. We make sure to recommend esports gambling sites that meet these expectations.</p>
<p>Good Variety of Free Bets and Promos</p>
<p>A good bonus speaks volumes, and League of Legends bettors can appreciate having access to a free bet or some other promotion. BetOnline is particularly good at allocating great promos that can be leveraged to boost individual games and selections.</p>
<p>All the above sites will try to provide you with a great variety of bonus options, whether this comes in the form of free bets, no deposit bonuses, or something else. You can generally use the bonuses on all matches, although some terms and conditions will apply.</p>
<p>Mobile Compatibility</p>
<p>Mobile is the king of any betting activity these days and especially when betting on League of Legends. Fans are constantly on the go, and they expect their betting experience to be just as well. That is why the best betting sites agree to provide you with quick and mobile options.</p>
<p>You can access all there is to know about League of Legends betting from your handheld device, whether this is a smartphone or a tablet. Placing and checking LoL bets on the go is a huge factor for bettors when they look to pick a proper operator.</p>
<p>Communities and Social Media Presence</p>
<p>The best LoL betting sites have read LoL fans right – we are all about communities, and as such, a good social media presence is always a must. You want to see an active community of fellow players who are passionate about LoL tournaments but also don’t mind chatting and exchanging banter. Establishing a good social presence is crucial when it comes to esportsbooks, and we make sure to factor in these criteria when we recommend a site.</p>
