<p>We spoke with Victoria Arias, VP of LatAm at Pragmatic Play, with whom we discussed the supplier’s position in the market and how far Pragmatic is willing to go. Arias has walked us through the company’s philosophy for the local market and how putting local preferences and needs first is a formula for success. Armed with a wide range of entertainment solutions, covering diverse preferences, Pragmatic Play has gained a firm foothold in the ever-vibrant Latin American market and is now looking to consolidate its local leadership.</p>
<p>Q: Victor, we are reaching out to you at a remarkable time for Pragmatic Play in the Latin American region. You have established a firm foothold in the region with new partnerships happening weekly - if this is not too much of a stretch. How has Pragmatic Play found the Latin American region so far as an iGaming market?</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been pleasantly surprised by the Latin American market, and it has advanced tremendously in a short amount of time and continues to grow, with an increasingly broad and interested user base in online gaming. I believe that the sector will continue down this path, with greater accessibility, technology, and professionalism.</p>
<p>When Pragmatic Play entered the region, it was aware of its immense potential. It faced a vast territory with diverse tastes and entertainment choices, which made it complex yet enticing.</p>
<p>However, the brand came armed with a wide range of entertainment solutions, covering very diverse preferences, and as a result, it made significant progress, reflected in successful partnerships, and engaged customers.</p>
<p>Q: As a supplier with global reach, what have been the unique challenges in building an ecosystem in this diverse landscape where no two countries seem to be very much alike when it comes to their gambling habits? Has your international experience been helpful here or did you have to start from scratch in LatAm?</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, Pragmatic Play operates within a diverse ecosystem in terms of culture and regulatory frameworks, and this is quite evident. In this regard, the experience of each team member has been invaluable in understanding the complexities of the Latin American industry and overcoming challenges.</p>
<p>In my case, it has allowed me to better understand the demands of each country and adopt the appropriate strategies. Likewise, Pragmatic Play has learned that flexibility and a deep understanding of local preferences are essential for building a solid ecosystem and achieving significant goals.</p>
<p>Q: Earlier this year, you were awarded during the inaugural SiGMA Americas and Brazilian iGaming Summit, stepping away with three rewards from the event - Virtual Sports Provider of the Year, Mobile Game Provider of the Year, and Best Game Producer. What do you think gave you an edge during the event and really made you stand out from all the other remarkable names attending?</p>
<p>Those awards are a clear reflection of Pragmatic Play’s commitment to excellence. What set the brand apart during the event was its dedication to innovation and the unmatched quality of its entertainment portfolio. At the time, Virtual Sports as a vertical was particularly valued, performing exceptionally well and being a favorite in the Brazilian market.</p>
<p>The key lies in the talent of Pragmatic Play’s team, constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of development. Their ability to combine innovation with deep sector knowledge and their agility in adapting to unique demands is what gives them a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Q: What is your next move in Latin America, is it going to be a focus on growing your footprint through operator partnerships or both the delivery of tailored games for the region and deals with prominent companies?</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s strategy in Latin America was initially focused on positioning. Now, the efforts will be directed towards maintaining the first place that it currently holds and expanding through partnerships with operators, which are the foundation of its presence in the region.</p>
<p>Collaboration with renowned companies and the quality of the offered content will remain essential components of Pragmatic Play’s plan. It’s about striking the right balance between commercial agreements and continuous product development, ensuring the best possible gaming experience for users throughout the territory.</p>
