<p>Play’n GO has hit the refresh button on its iconic “Dead” series with the release of Scales of Dead, a fresh 5x3 slot with a 20x000x max win</p>
<p>Known for its top-quality slot releases since its grand opening in 2005, the Swedish studio with an impressive portfolio reaching operators in over 25 regulated jurisdictions worldwide, Play’n GO, has added yet another exciting title to its highly-praised “Dead” series.</p>
<p>Scales of Dead is the name of the brand-new slot that has joined the Pilgrim of Dead game launched at the start of the year with bells and whistles. Will there ever be enough games in the “Dead” series? Fervent fans would most likely say no to that, and for good reason.</p>

<p>Join the Lone Adventurer in Search of the Golden Snake Tomb</p>
<p>Slot aficionados for whom the “Dead” games feel like home will immediately notice a handful of elements from Rich Wilde and the Book of Dead and Legacy of Dead in the new Scales of Dead game.</p>
<p>The slot, which is played on a classic 5×3 grid, smartly intertwines the past and the present in a mesmerizing plot with a maximum win set at x20,000. The latter represents the highest max win from the entire series, giving players both an extra rush of adrenaline and the feeling that they are engaged in a cleverly polished game with excellent mechanics.</p>
<p>The captivating story embedded in the game is that of a lone adventurer set to explore a fascinating piece of land in Ancient Egypt. His main purpose during the nail-biting navigation of the dangerous sandstorms is to grab the hidden treasures at the Golden Snake Tomb.</p>
<p>To do that, he will need to make use of a series of special items and use wild animals to his advantage. This will also trigger wins on the grid. For instance, landing a minimum of three Amulet, Colored Royal, Fox, Serpent, or Falcon symbols will lead to a standard win.</p>
<p>Coming across three Tomb scatter symbols will help the lone adventurer easily unlock the Original Free Spins bonus round. During it, players will be granted up to eight Free Spins.</p>
<p>Any Multipliers and Special Symbols making an apparition during this round will lead to even greater wins. After all, the win potential is as unpredictable as the sands of Ancient Egypt during a destructive storm.</p>
<p>Expanding Symbols, Sandstorm Free Spins &amp; Gamble Feature</p>
<p>Players can also trigger Expanding Symbols after a regular win. To do this, they must come across at least three reels featuring a special symbol for low-paying symbols and at least two reels with a special symbol for high-paying symbols.</p>
<p>Once the trigger function is completed, a one-of-a-kind symbol will take the place of the symbols on the reels that were involved in the feature.</p>
<p>To engage in the Sandstorm Free Spins round, players must come across at least a pair of Scatters while playing the Free Spins bonus round. The four Sandstorm Free Spins that players can come across have a more appealing win potential. They can also be accompanied by randomized Multipliers.</p>
<p>The Sandstorm Free Spins round can be triggered again with the help of two extra Scatters.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has also introduced the Gamble feature to allow players to put their guessing skills to use after winning less than 2,500 coins.</p>
<p>Wins can double their size when players manage to guess the right color and they can go up four times when guessing the suit. The Gamble Round feature, which is “reminiscent of some legacy titles” in the series, according to head of game retention, George Olekszy, can be used up to five times in a row or up to 2,500 coins. Commenting on the new release, Olekszy explained the “Dead” series “just earned itself another classic title.”</p>
<p>In July, the studio launched Merlin: Journey of Flame, another sequel to an equally popular series, shortly after it announced it would foray into brick-and-mortar gaming via William Hill in the UK.</p>
