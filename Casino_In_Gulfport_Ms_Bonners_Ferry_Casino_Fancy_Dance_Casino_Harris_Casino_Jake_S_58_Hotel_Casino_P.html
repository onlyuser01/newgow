<p>The company's entry in Italy marks an important step in its expansion and helps its leading games reach new players and partner operators</p>
<p>Fast-growing business-to-business (B2B) gaming supplier Push Gaming expanded further its European presence by announcing a new market entry. On Thursday the company confirmed it entered the regulated market in Italy. The entry marked the debut of Push Gaming into the market, which is believed to be one of the most lucrative jurisdictions on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent entry, Push Gaming’s partner operators will be able to access leading content. Initially, operators in the region will have access to seven of the company’s popular games such as Jammin’ Jars, Razor Shark, as well as Big Bamboo, an award-winning game.</p>
<p>The B2B Operator Plans to Continue Expansion</p>
<p>Fiona Hickey, Push Gaming’s director of new business and markets, revealed that the company is delighted to expand its presence and deliver its portfolio of content for operators in Italy. According to her, players and operators within the market are excited about the entry which will see the delivery of engaging and award-winning titles.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be entering Italy for the first time and see the hunger, from both operators and players for our high-quality titles in the marketplace.“ Fiona Hickey, director of new business and markets at Push Gaming</p>
<p>Hickey added that Push Gaming plans to establish itself as a go-to provider of content for the market in Italy in an effort to “mirror” its already established presence in other jurisdictions around the world. She said that the market in the country is one of the oldest in Europe. Finally, Hickey noted: “Italian players are among the most discerning and being able to put our diverse content in front of them is something we’ve been looking forward to for some time.”</p>
<p>Besides its debut in Italy, Push Gaming confirmed its plans to expand further in the market. The company outlined that it plans to deliver all of its 30 leading games to players in the country soon. This expansion will help players in Italy engage with Push Gaming’s fan-favorite games and at the same time reaffirm the growing position of the company on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, the company recently expanded its reach in strategic markets such as the UK. Additionally, Push Gaming recently entered the regulated market in Belgium by agreeing to deliver its content to 777 Belgium. The entry into the Netherlands also marked a significant achievement for the company on its way to expanding its European footprint.</p>
