<p>Dear bergsiek</p>
<p>I was informed that this was sent to you via email (I will leave it in the original German language)</p>
<p>"Dear Mr Bergsiek,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the inquiry about CasinoGuru.</p>
<p>In order to make withdrawals in the future, the account must be verified. To verify the account, you can upload the following documents:</p>
<ol>
<li>The credit card**8517 . Please cover the 8 number in the middle and upload the card like this?</li>
</ol>
<p>You will find helpful tips on the following link: https://www.xn--drckglck-75ae.de/dokumente-hochladen/</p>
<p>You can find the direct link to upload the documents here: https://www.xn--drckglck-75ae.de/?dl=docs</p>
<p>You can actually see how many points you need to convert into your account through your account. You click Personal Area - Cash Management - Active Bonuses. In order to request a withdrawal you must first convert any active bonuses that you have in your account. And you wager a bonus by redeeming it x60 the amount.</p>
<p>You have already collected 17.59 points out of 534.</p>
<p>You receive 0.5 points for every euro wagered, whether you win or lose on the spin, or with real money or bonus credit.</p>
<p>You can wager your bonus on all slot machines. Before you open a game you can press the "i" in the top right corner and if there is a bonus game it means that you can use your bonus balance in the game. Game examples would be Book of Dead, Spinning Wilds, THOR and many others. "</p>
<p>Have you received this email? You have provided this email bergsiek@t-online.de to us, is this the same email that you have used for registration in DrueckGlueck Casino DE?</p>
