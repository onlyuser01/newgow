<p>Sports betting and gaming entertainment company BetMGM announced today a new partnership with the Houston Astros designated it as the exclusive Sports Betting Partner of the MLB franchise.</p>
<p>Expanding Sports Portfolio</p>
<p>The partnership between BetMGM and the Houston Astros marked Texas’ first partnership of the sports betting and iGaming brand which is currently operational with retail and mobile across 23 US states.</p>
<p>Hailing the new partnership as “a monumental addition” to the company’s portfolio of professional sports team partnerships nationwide, BetMGM’s chief executive officer Adam Greenblatt outlined the high hopes the partnership would mark the beginning of growth for the company in this part of the US.</p>
<p>“The organization’s passionate fan base will be key to the growth of BetMGM throughout the South as we look for new ways to engage fans with unique experiences that go beyond the game.” Adam Greenblatt, CEO, BetMGM</p>
<p>The strategic agreement with the Astros will see BetMGM signage featured at Minute Maid Park, the retractable roof stadium in Downtown Houston, Texas – home of the MLB franchise, as a permanent outfield wall sign and rotational promotional messaging behind home plate.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to our partnership with BetMGM. As we continue to strive for new ways to add to the fan experience, this partnership will provide another way for the Astros to engage with our fans.” Giles Kibbe, SVP, General Counsel, Houston Astros</p>
<p>A variety of VIP experiences such as throwing out the first pitch, on-field access to batting practice, and VIP getaways for away games exclusive to BetMGM customers will be presented to fans of the Astros to help the professional baseball team strengthen its bond with the fans while BetMGM gains popularity among Astros fans.</p>
<p>Out-of-State Collaboration</p>
<p>In addition, Houston Astros will help BetMGM’s promotional efforts in Louisiana as both partners will collaborate to offer customers of the sports betting and gaming brand in the neighboring state special betting promotions.</p>
<p>BetMGM launched its online sports betting platform in the Pelican State in January this year, offering local sports bettors not only a variety of betting options but also experiences at MGM Resorts’ Beau Rivage Resort &amp; Casino and Gold Strike in Mississippi, as well as Bellagio and MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Borgata in New Jersey, and MGM National Harbor in Maryland.</p>
<p>And while continuing to expand into new markets nationwide, the operator keeps its focus on responsible gaming education by providing its customers, via integration with GameSense, with resources to educate them on how to play responsibly.</p>
<p>Available across both BetMGM’s mobile and desktop platforms, the leading industry program developed by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation allows customers direct access to responsible gaming tools.</p>
<p>In March, both MGM Resorts and BetMGM affirmed their commitment to responsible gaming by joining the National Council on Problem Gambling’s Problem Gambling Awareness Month campaign.</p>
