<p>Did you know the current WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury is named after Mike Tyson? This fact shows the influence Iron Mike’s had on boxing. Considered to be the very best boxer in the history of the sport, Mike Tyson is coming back to the ring. This weekend, we’ll see him putting his gloves on for the Mike Tyson vs Roy Jones Jr fight.</p>
<p>The former undisputed heavyweight world champ is going to fight his first bout after 15 years. It’s not going to be an easy fight, as he’s facing Roy Jones Jr, who had been fighting through the 2010s, with his most recent fight happening two years ago.</p>

<p>Exhibition Bout Between Two Boxers in Their 50s</p>
<p>It’s been more than 15 years since we saw Mike Tyson in the ring the previous time. But, Iron Mike is back! He’s putting his gloves on to face another boxing legend, Roy Jones Jr, whom he’s never faced before.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why two guys in their 50s are going to fight, there are several reasons for that. Fame, glory, love for the sport? Sure, but money as well.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, Roy Jones Jr is going to cash in about $3 million from this fight. Tyson, on the other hand, should get as much as $10 million.</p>
<p>Still, even though Mike Tyson’s net worth is way lower than it was at the height of his professional career, Iron Mike claims he won’t take a single cent from this fight. Instead, his entire purse will go to charity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with or without the purse, the Mike Tyson vs Roy Jones Jr fight is bound to get the two fighters back in the spotlight. This goes especially if the bout we see on Saturday turns out to be an entertaining one.</p>

<p>Iron Mike Seems to Be in a Fantastic Shape</p>
<p>Over the last couple of months, social media platforms have been flooded with Mike Tyson training videos. The reason behind them going viral is that Iron Mike looks really ripped in them.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the Mike Tyson workout footage also shows him doing really well in the gym. According to his own admission, he’s been doing “two hours on cardio, the bike and the treadmill for an hour, and light weights, 300, 250 reps.”</p>
<p>It’s really great to see him back in shape, knowing that he used to struggle with his weight just a few years before. As per the man himself, he used to be 90 lbs. overweight, doing cocaine on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The good news is that those days are behind him. Still, the question is whether his resurrection means he’s capable of beating Roy Jones Jr, who’s three years his junior and whose most recent fight happened in 2018.</p>
<p>Tyson Taking on the Reigning Cruiserweight Champ</p>
<p>Roy Jones Jr is the World Boxing Union cruiserweight champion. He became the champ in 2018 by winning against Scott Sigmon by unanimous decision after 10 rounds.</p>
<p>A year earlier, he beat Bobby Gunn by technical knockout in Round 8, winning the (Foundation) cruiserweight title. In 2016, Roy Jones Jr won two fights, while in 2015, he suffered the most recent defeat of his career.</p>
<p>None of those fights were heavyweight fights. In fact, the last time he fought in the heavyweight division was back in 2003. That’s when he defeated John Ruiz (the guy who beat Evander Holyfield) for the WBA Heavyweight title.</p>
<p>Mike Tyson vs Roy Jones Jr Prediction</p>
<p>Because they’re not young, Tyson and Jones will have to comply with some rules meant to keep them safe. For instance, there’s the “no knockout” rule, which means it’s very likely we’re going to witness the maximum number of rounds.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the fight is supposed to see a maximum of eight rounds (instead of 12, which is a standard for heavyweight bouts), each lasting two minutes.</p>
<p>That said, the fight will probably go the distance. When it comes to the fight winner, the judges are the ones who will make the final decision. It could go either way, but Mike Tyson is a -200 favorite for a reason – he’s among the best heavyweight fighters to walk the earth.</p>
