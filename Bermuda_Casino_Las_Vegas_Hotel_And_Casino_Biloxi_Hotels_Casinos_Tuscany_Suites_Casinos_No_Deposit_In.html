<p>Aztec Adventure review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Aztec civilisation existed in Central America across a period that more or less covers the end of the High Middle Ages in Europe. For about two hundred and fifty years between about 1300 and the arrival of Spanish immigrants in the early-1500s their towering pyramids were the great architectural creations of the New World.</p>
<p>But what if they had invented a slot machine?</p>
<p>That is the bold alternative history proposed in Aztec Adventure by BF Games. A strange idol, possessed with fire energy holds out a cylinder of stone to you on which three rows of three symbols are revealed. Press a button and the idol spins the cylinder to make a simple three by three slot.</p>
<p>So now we know.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are really where Aztec Adventure wears its colours. The gameplay is deliberately simple to allow for the greatest possible quality in the presentation.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>And at that level it works. The three dimensional animation is beautifully rendered and the whole thing looks as good on a laptop screen or mobile phone as on something larger (sometimes a problem with very high-def slots).</p>
<p>The animations for the reel spins are both fun and varied with the idol spinning the reels with various gestures that really give the game a sense of character and a unique atmosphere. In particular, the way the idol moves to display the wins is something that really uses the 3d graphics to their full potential.</p>
<p>That atmosphere is hugely enhanced by the background audio of jungle noises and the pan pipe musical track, but also by the other sound effects: the rumble of the stones as they spin, the odd chanting of the idol, it all adds up to something that feels about as immersive as a slot machine can possibly be.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay for this game is solid. A clear effort has been made not to overcomplicate the gameplay in order to allow the animation and programming teams to go to town on the visuals. The result is a game that does not do a huge amount but does all of it well.</p>
<p>As a result, what you get is a three by three slot with twenty seven win ways. Twenty seven win ways is most easily described as any three symbol combo with one symbol on each reel.</p>
<p>The four lowest paying symbols are stacked and pay out triple per line if you fill all nine available spots on the reels with the same symbol.</p>
<p>There is also a simple double or nothing gamble feature which can be used to bump up Aztec Adventure’s volatility and some basic special symbols described below.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring free spins bonus</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is a Wild symbol which substitutes for any other symbol except for the Scatter. You can only hit one Wild per reel, but if you hit one on all three reels they will pay out 20 times your bet as well as the various other wins.</p>
<p>The Scatter provides fifteen free games if you land three of them. Like the Wild you can only hit one per reel. You can retrigger the Free Spins.</p>
<p>Aztec Adventure features also a gamble function</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.22%, a pretty standard amount for slots in the industry.</p>
<p>The range of bet on the site we tested was $/£/€0.10 to $/£/€50.00 which should cover most people’s bankrolls but might leave a few super high rollers out in the cold. Your mileage may differ depending on what site you use though.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, and can be boosted through liberal use of the gamble feature. We do prefer the higher variance option as this works best with our slot strategies.</p>
<p>Paytable for Aztec Adventure slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Aztec Adventure is a gorgeous looking slot with a lot of character and an immersive atmosphere.</p>
<p>The gameplay is a little simple, but that should not deter you unless you crave the kind of stimulation that complex minigames provide.</p>
<p>The return to player and variance are not great, but well within the bounds of what we are willing to recommend. So the main thing influencing a recommendation is whether the style works for you.</p>
