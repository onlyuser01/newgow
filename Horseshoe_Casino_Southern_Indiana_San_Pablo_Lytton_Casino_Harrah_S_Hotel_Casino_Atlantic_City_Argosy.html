    <h1>Horseshoe Casino Southern Indiana San Pablo Lytton Casino Harrah S Hotel Casino Atlantic City Argosy</h1>

<p>First FuboTV now DAZN - everyone seems to be aware of the potential of sports and media partnerships. Disney’s ESPN was reluctant to embrace sports betting in the wake of legalization in 2018 and 2019, but "The Daily Wager" and other sports betting-related shows did arrive on the programming. There is talk about spinning off ESPN from Disney to give the company an even stronger hand in the vertical.</p>
<p>Now, it’s FanDuel, a leading American sportsbook, to claw its share of this market with the announcement of FanDuel TV, which will combine a linear cable television network and a new OTT platform, FanDuel+. This comes just a month after the extension of the company’s partnership with the NFL in Canada.</p>
<p>The North American gaming and betting giant is slated to go live with both FanDuel TV and FanDuel+ this September and it will be the first time that an industry giant has attempted to take on both the linear and digital network experiences in the broader context of sports wagering. Commenting on this opportunity, FanDuel CCO Mike Raffensperger said:</p>
<p>We intend for FanDuel TV to sit at the intersection of live sports and interactive content and believe Kay is the best example of an on-air talent who can bring fans closer to the narratives of the games they care about most.</p>
<p>FanDuel is aware of what is going up, particularly FuboTV, which has been delivering content that is largely seen by industryspecialists as the next generation. However, FanDuel TV and FanDuel+ will be delivering more dedicated content and live sports programming than any other competitor out there, FanDuel Group said in a press release.</p>
<p>FanDuel has already secured several leading media and sports personalities who will help the company steer to greatness. One of them is Kay Adamas, who was the host of Good Morning Football on the NFL Network, and will now headline the network with a daily morning show five days a week, the company added.</p>
<p>To sweeten the deal, FanDuel+ will be available for free to current FanDuel account holders. This will cover every vertical currently available to FanDuel, including casino, horse racing, sportsbook, and DFS, which is the original vertical in which FanDuel started. In other words, casino players will have access to FanDuel+.</p>
<p>There will be more talent added to the production and network, with Pat McAfee and PMI Network’s team joining to produce dedicated shows focused on sports wagering. Then, there will be The Ringer’s crew and Bill Simmons who will be adding more content. Other notable participants include Lisa Kerney, who is a former ESPN SportsCenter anchor who hosts FanDuel’s show, More Ways to Win.</p>
