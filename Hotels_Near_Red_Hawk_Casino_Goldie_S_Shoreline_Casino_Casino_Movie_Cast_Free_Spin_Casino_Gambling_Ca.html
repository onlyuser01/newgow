    <h1>Hotels Near Red Hawk Casino Goldie S Shoreline Casino Casino Movie Cast Free Spin Casino Gambling Ca</h1>

<p>Good afternoon, I will immediately clarify that the text is translated from Ukrainian.</p>
<p>I played in this casino for a long time (the wager is about 1KK dollars), I did not break the rules, I did not create several accounts. At the beginning of October I won about 5K BUSD in dice. The next day, I could not withdraw funds, as I was limited to 1K per day. I was withdrawing 1K for several days, and then my withdrawal was completely blocked. Support said to submit documents for verification and that this process would take up to 3 days. I sent all the necessary documents. After 3 days passed, my withdrawal was not unblocked, no one answered my questions, they did not tell me the reason for the blocking. On October 31, they wrote to me that they set a withdrawal limit of 5K, after which I will be blocked (correspondence in the attachment). The reason for the blocking and what is happening in general was not explained. I withdrew part of the funds, about 4K, the rest did not work out, since the Internet disappeared, I did not receive a response to the request to allow the withdrawal of all funds. In addition to funds, the casino has about 10K casino coins (chips) and about 60-80 roulette tickets left. Because of this, I am not able to indicate the exact disputed amount of funds. I repeat once again, I did not violate any rules, the casino unilaterally blocked me, this is unacceptable, no charges were brought against me. I hope for your help in solving this problem. Ready to provide the necessary information and answer additional questions.</p>
