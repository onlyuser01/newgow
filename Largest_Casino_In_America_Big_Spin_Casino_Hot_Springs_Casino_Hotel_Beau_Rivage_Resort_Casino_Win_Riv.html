<p>The successor to the popular PokerMatch platform has announced a new brand that is setting the stage with three verticals at the same time</p>
<p>Pokerbet will be diving straight into sports betting, casino, and poker products right from the get-go as it seeks to offer players unrivalled experiences in each and every one of them. The company calls itself an “improved” successor to PokerMatch and it seeks to create new paradigms that invite and add high entertainment value as they do competition.</p>
<p>Pokermatch’s Successor Arrives – What’s Next?</p>
<p>Pokerbet CEO Ruslan Bangert has welcomed the opportunity to introduce and outline his company to a wider audience. He described the creation of this new brand as a long-anticipated move that has been in the works for a while.</p>
<p>“This is a new brand that, in my opinion, embodies the best qualities and characteristics of a strong and competitive gaming platform,” Banger said confidently. The poker website will focus on cash games, and tournaments, and create an equitable playfield in which players can progress based on their skill, with the formats supported including Texas Hold’em and Omaha, as well as others, such as fast Windfall tourneys.</p>
<p>The casino will introduce players to a variety of live casino games, jackpots, virtual casino products, slots, and more. Then, there is the sports betting division which will focus on providing players with competitive odds, excellent value-added betting opportunities, and a wholesome sports betting experience from start to finish.</p>
<p>Bangert said that Pokerbet will be a brand that is focused on bringing the best possible experience to its customers and that will focus on surprising its audiences by continually innovating the experience. “Pokerbet will become the best friend for those who constantly strive to be winners,” Bangert added confident in the brand’s future success.</p>
<p>There is no official go date for the new website and all of its product offerings just yet, but Bangert and Pokerbet will be sharing more details as they become available.</p>
