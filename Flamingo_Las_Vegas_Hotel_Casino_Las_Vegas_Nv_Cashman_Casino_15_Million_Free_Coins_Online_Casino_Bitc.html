    <h1>Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Cashman Casino 15 Million Free Coins Online Casino Bitc</h1>

<p>We've thoroughly reviewed Playsunny Casino and gave it an Above average Safety Index. It's generally a good casino to play at, but there are some things worth noting. In our review, we've considered the casino's player complaints, estimated revenues, license, games genuineness, customer support quality, fairness of terms and conditions, withdrawal and win limits, and other factors. So, if you were ever wondering whether this casino is safe and legit or a scam, read the full review below to learn more.</p>
<p>According to our research and estimates, Playsunny Casino is a smaller online casino revenue-wise. The revenue of a casino is an important factor, as bigger casinos shouldn't have any issues paying out big wins, while smaller casinos could potentially struggle if you manage to win really big.</p>
<p>We have found no relevant complaints about this casino.</p>
<p>Warning: Playsunny Casino has a €250,000 daily total win limit. This means that the sum of your wins in one day (not factoring in your losses), can't be higher than €250,000. If you win more, you will not get the money exceeding the limit. We consider any win limit to be extremely unfair to players, which is why we penalize any casino that has implemented it, unless the win limit is enforced by third-party factors, such as local regulations.</p>
<p>Playsunny Casino has an Above average Safety Index. We've given it this rating because we think it's doing many things well, however, there is something holding it back from getting an even higher rating from us. Even despite that, you can expect this casino to be a good place to play at.</p>
