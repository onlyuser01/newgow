<p>As the international sports betting company Parimatch and the Italian football organization Juventus celebrate the first anniversary of their partnership, they announced that exciting collaborative campaigns are coming.</p>
<p>Parimatch and Juventus Commemorate One Year of Partnership</p>
<p>Parimatch revealed that the next football season will be marked with several different marketing initiatives, just like those from the 2020 football season. True to their word, the bookmaker and the football team released a short 1-minute promotional video that featured the most recognizable Juventus players: Christiano Ronaldo, Wojciech Szczęsny, Luiz Da Silva Danilo, Arthur Melo and Alvaro Morata.</p>
<p>The video showed was produced by the Ukrainian creative production house Electric Sheep Film. It featured the five mentioned players engaged in a heated match across an abstract digital landscape. The promotional content ended with the slogan “Parimatch – Juventus official partner. They play, you win.”</p>
<p>According to Parimatch, the advertisement has proven to be very successful worldwide and has boosted the popularity of the operator among Juventus fans, helping them take their sports engagement further.</p>
<p>Thrilled to Continue Their Joint Endeavors</p>
<p>Parimatch Tech’s chief marketing officer, Ivan Liashenko, commented on the continued collaboration with Juventus. He revealed that the first year of the partnership had been incredibly fruitful to both parties. Liashenko is excited to continue working with the professional football team and is saying so on behalf of all of Parimatch.</p>
<p>“Being a partner to a legendary club with over 120 years’ worth of history is an honor, and as our second year of mutual work begins, we can’t wait to launch several powerful campaigns together,” Liashenko teased.</p>
<p>He added that he is sure that Juventus fans will be just as excited as the team and the operator is. Liashenko said that “even bolder and more entertaining digital and offline experiences” are coming so fans should stay tuned.</p>
<p>Parimatch continues to establish a strong presence in the world of professional European sports and football. Just a few days ago the operator signed deals with three English Premier League clubs, namely Aston Villa, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, and Southampton. The deal is much like Parimatch’s deal with Chelsea and will give the sports betting operator access to offline and digital rights, ticketing, merchandise, and hospitality initiatives. The deal also includes joint marketing projects, similarly to the current Juventus agreement.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the bookmaker was approved by the KRAIL and became one of the pioneers on the Ukrainian betting market. Thanks to this, Parimatch is allowed to provide esports betting options to local fans.</p>
