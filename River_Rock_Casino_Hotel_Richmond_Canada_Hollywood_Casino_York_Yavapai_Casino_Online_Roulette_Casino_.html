Its diverse teams, Mohegan says, are not only a commitment but a strategic asset that bolsters the company’s competitiveness.</p>
<p>Ray Pineault, Mohegan’s president and chief executive officer, elaborated on this, saying that a diverse workforce is the key to “fostering creativity, innovation and a dynamic environment where new ideas thrive.” Pineault added that his team is delighted to appear on Newsweek’s list.</p>
<p>We are immensely proud of this recognition, and being named to this prestigious list reflects our ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion and underscores the success of our efforts to integrate diversity at every level of our operations. Ray Pineault, president &amp; CEO, Mohegan</p>
<p>Naketrice Snow, the company’s director of people experience, also shared her thoughts on the matter, praising the recognition. Snow reaffirmed Mohegan’s commitment to fostering a healthy workplace where every team member can feel valued and empowered.</p>
