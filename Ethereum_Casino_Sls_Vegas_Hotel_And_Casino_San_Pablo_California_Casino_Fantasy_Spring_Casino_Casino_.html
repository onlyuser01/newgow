    <h1>Ethereum Casino Sls Vegas Hotel And Casino San Pablo California Casino Fantasy Spring Casino Casino</h1>

<p>Yeah I made an account at UNIBET Pa casino last year in 2022 &amp; after that I tried depositing with my own debit card, which wouldn’t work, so I thought (I didn’t know much about casinos at the time) I could deposit with my friends card since mine wasn’t working. Well, that obviously didn’t work either and they have closed my account &amp; I’m gonna provide the screenshots of emails and conversations Ive had trying to reopen my account. So only on their terms that in order to open it again is to send a picture of the front/back of the card that was my friends I used to them and that’s it. But unfortunately It’s been a year, my friend doesn’t have that card anymore, and has already contacted the bank about seeing if he could get the debit card statement showing the ending numbers 8126 and the bank responded that they couldn’t provide that for previous account holders and there was nothing they could do. So I’ve been trying to see if UNIBET will accept my Drivers License ID (front/back) utility statement/bank of a current card. To gain access to my account again and that’s a no. In which I don’t understand why it’s absolutely necessary that they HAVE to have a photo of the card I previously had tried and failed??? Any other PA casino wouldn’t act like this over one card.. I just want to be able to access my account and they make it complicated demanding that’s the only way. Can someone please try to help me resolve this issue? I can provide every document they requested in the email just not the card ending in 8126 or the credit card statements.</p>
