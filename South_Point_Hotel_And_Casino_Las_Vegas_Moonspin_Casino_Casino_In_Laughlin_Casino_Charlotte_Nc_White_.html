    <h1>South Point Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Moonspin Casino Casino In Laughlin Casino Charlotte Nc White</h1>

<p>The gaming studio operating out of Isle of Man wants to develop blockchain-powered games that will help online gambling operators boost engagement with their audiences</p>
<p>Bitblox Games will now be building dedicated crypto games based on the Hxro Network, which is a Solana-powered distributed liquidity layer designed for the needs of betting applications.</p>
<p>Crypto Games May Finally Arrive in Online Gambling</p>
<p>The company is happy to have confirmed that it will be ramping up its efforts in the delivery of dedicated crypto games to be integrated with leading iGaming industry operators, which is estimated to be worth $68 billion globally.</p>
<p>Bitblox Games argues that itâ€™s the first company to have embarked on delivering a fully-fledged blockchain-based gaming experience to the online gambling market, thanks to its focus on Hxro Network, which will help it with a suite of on-chain games in the coming months.</p>
<p>The decision by Bitblox Games to move into the online gambling space could have broader implications for the Solana ecosystem as well, as the Hxro Network. Hxro Network co-founder Dan Gunsberg welcomed the opportunity and said:</p>
<p>On-chain gaming is a surprisingly underserved subset of the multibillion-dollar global igaming market. Bitblox will bring the online gambling industry into the Web3 era. Hxro Network co-founder Dan Gunsberg</p>
<p>The games are designed to help iGaming operators in the gambling space to become more competitive and to bring more solutions to bear, allowing their players to rediscover exciting new ways to play and unrivalled products to explore. Blockchain has long been touted as a relevant part of the iGaming experience.</p>
<p>Recently, 7777 gaming, a traditional supplier of games, expanded its reach in the blockchain and cryptocurrency iGaming sector with a content partnership with Yolo Group, the company that owns Bitcasino.io and Sportsbet.io, two licensed crypto operators.</p>
<p>The advancements in technology have allowed more casinos to consider trying to cater to this exciting market. Yet, most blockchain and crypto games have been developed internally, with games like Dice, Crash, and Plinko, usually hosted by the companies themselves. Bitblox is hoping to change this and offer a wider variety of crypto-focused games.</p>
