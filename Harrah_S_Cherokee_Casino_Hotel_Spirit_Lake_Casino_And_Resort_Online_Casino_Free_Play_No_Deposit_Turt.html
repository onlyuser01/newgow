<p>Spillemyndigheden, the Danish Gambling Authority, has announced its quarterly statistics showing the total gross gaming revenue (GGR) reported by licensed gambling operators for the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Land-Based Gambling Revenue Increases</p>
<p>Overall, GGR for online casinos, gaming machines, land-based casinos and betting in Q2, 2022 hit DKK 1,688 million ($229 million). When compared to the same period last year, the result in Q2, 2022 marked an increase of 7.4% or DKK 116 million ($15.8 million). According to the Authority, the result in Q2 last year was impacted negatively mainly due to the various COVID-related measures as well as temporary closures. Considering that this year, restrictions were lifted and the gambling venues remained open for the full quarter, GGR increased.</p>
<p>The highest increase in GGR was reported by brick-and-mortar casinos. In total, land-based venues reported revenue of DKK 98 million ($13.4 million). This marked an increase of DKK 60 million ($8.2 million) or 163.4% when compared to Q2 last year. Similarly, the GGR for gaming machines in Q2 soared to DKK 319 million ($43.5 million). When compared to Q2 last year, this result marked an increase of 95.4%, or DKK 165 million ($22.5 million).</p>
<p>Number of Self-Excluded Individual Increases</p>
<p>Besides GGR, the Danish Gambling Authority released details regarding the number of self-excluded players. It said that ever since ROFUS, the Danish Gambling Authorityâ€™s register of self-excluded players was created back in 2012, the number of players kept growing every year. The Authority revealed that as of June 1, 2022, the number of self-excluded players hit 33,648. Of that total, 76%, or 25,564 were men, while 8,084 were women.</p>
<p>Online Gambling, Betting GGR Dips</p>
<p>In contrast to the soaring results for brick-and-mortar casinos and gaming machines GGR, the revenue reported by online casinos and betting marked a decrease in Q2, 2022. The total GGR reported in Q2 this year for online casino hit DKK 708 million ($96.5 million). When compared to the same period last year, a decrease of 1% was observed.
