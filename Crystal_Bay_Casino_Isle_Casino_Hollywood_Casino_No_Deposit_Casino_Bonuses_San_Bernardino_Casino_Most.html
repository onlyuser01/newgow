    <h1>Crystal Bay Casino Isle Casino Hollywood Casino No Deposit Casino Bonuses San Bernardino Casino Most</h1>

<p>Hello, good morning. I informed this casino on January 8th that I'm addicted to gambling and wanted to block my account. After the casino didn't respond to me on the 24/7 live chat (which was responding when I talked about other subjects), I started depositing again and lost R$4500 in deposits. I believe responsible gambling policies should prohibit a player from making deposits after (1) informing the casino they have an addiction; and (2) asking to be blocked.</p>
<p>Before I finish, here's one more example of how the casino doesn't care about Responsible Gambling: as I'm writing this complaint, I asked in the casino's chat for them to block my account due to addiction and return these deposits. The chat operator limited to recommend me to use the site less times in the week (using only alarms when I reached a specific time, but didn't limit me); and stopped replying when I asked for permanent blocking.</p>
<p>I plead to include the casino in this complaint so they can provide their version. Unfortunately, this site doesn't have a quality chat history so I can bring the prints. I managed to attach a print where a chat operator proves my exclusion request hadn't been processed.</p>
