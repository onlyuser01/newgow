    <h1>Casino In Houston Casino Slot Machines Near Me Casino Hollywood Buffet Admiral Casino Games Biz Logi</h1>

<p>Zitro, a company that specializes in the manufacturing and delivery of state-of-the-art game cabinets for the land-based casino industry, has announced a new partnership with Grand Casino Baden. As a result, Zitro will deliver one of its newest and most successful cabinets, the Altius Glare, which will be installed on-site at the Grand Casino Baden in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Altius Glare is equipped with the company’s premium multi-game solution, Wheel of Legends. The cabinet is also a unique piece of machinery that features a 55-inch 4K display along with 27-inch full-HD base game display, intelligent LED halo, and other technical features that make the overall experience immersive and highly-rewarding.</p>
<p>The cabinet comes with a number of gamification features and four game themes that have made the Altius Glare a massive success worldwide. The cabinet’s arrival was welcomed by Grand Casino Baden’s Chief Gaming Officer, Patrick Konzack, who was thrilled to have this new product on the casino’s gaming floor.</p>
<p>He said that the entire team was delighted to have Zitro as a partner and praised the company’s innovative and exciting solutions that come along with "first-class support." Konzack further explained that the games that Zitro provides through its state-of-the-art cabinets are precisely what the company needs to better engage with players and offer them the best possible gaming value on the market.</p>
<p>"We look forward to our continued partnership and to keep adding more games in the near future," the CGO concluded. Zitro EMEA Regional Director Nadège Teyssedre was similarly pleased with the results.</p>
<p>"We are proud to once again partner with Grand Casino Baden and introduce one of Zitro’s most popular slot titles at this prestigious casino venue," the executive said. This collaboration was what Teyssedre described as a meaningful partnership. In the meantime, Zitro has been very particular about building its presence across different markets and making sure that it’s a recognized name in each.</p>
<p>Just a few months back, Zitro said that it is expanding its presence in the French land-based gaming market. France is an important European market and one of the biggest when it comes to retail cabinets, hence Zitro’s determination to establish its footprint in the market and stand out.</p>
<p>The company is also aware of the impact of its operations and is looking to ensure that it reduces its carbon footprint. In 2022, the company said that it had achieved a reduction of 80% compared to a year before.</p>
