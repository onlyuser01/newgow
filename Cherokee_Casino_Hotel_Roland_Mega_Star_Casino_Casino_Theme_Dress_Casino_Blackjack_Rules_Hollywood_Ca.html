<p>Liverpool are traveling to the Spanish capital on Wednesday to try and do the impossible – beat Real Madrid at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu by three or more goals. It’s because, in leg 1 of the UCL round of 16, they lost 5-2</p>
<p>Barcelona is the only team that’s defeated Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu in more than two years. But maybe Liverpool can beat them on Wednesday? Unfortunately for the Reds, just winning isn’t enough. They need a big win instead.</p>
<p>The good news is that they’ve already proved they have a lot of firepower. Some 10 days ago, they demolished Manchester United 7-0.</p>

<p>Reigning Champions Taking This Game Seriously</p>
<p>Los Blancos do have a comfortable lead on aggregate, but you can be sure they won’t muck around on Wednesday. Instead, it’s very likely that manager Carlo Ancelotti will pick his best XI for the clash with Liverpool.</p>
<p>The main reason is that he knows that the Reds can be tricky in big games. After all, they did knock-out Real’s archrival Barcelona in the 2019 UCL after a historic comeback from being 0-3 down.</p>
<p>Another reason why Los Blancos will go all-in on Wednesday is that the game is played four days before the clash with Barcelona in La Liga. The UCL game would serve as a general rehearsal for the domestic league game.</p>
<p>The Reds to Attack with All They Got</p>
<p>Liverpool need a big win on Wednesday, with at least three goals in Real Madrid’s net. We say “at least” because a 3-0 win would take the game to extra time. And if they concede a goal(s), they will have to score even more than that.</p>
<p>They do have the confidence they can pull it off thanks to the brilliant performance against Manchester United some on March 5. They destroyed their EPL rivals 7-0 with the goals being scored by four different players – Cody Gakpo, Darwin Nunez, Mohamed Salah, and Roberto Firmino.</p>
<p>This fact shows that the Reds have plenty of offensive weapons in their arsenal. In addition to those four, they also got Diogo Jota in the attack, as well as many offensive-minded midfielders.</p>
<p>Real Madrid vs Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Liverpool are going to attack ferociously on Wednesday. Does this mean Real Madrid will defend? No way, knowing that they’re playing in front of their fans. Instead, they’re going to fight back. The result is that we’re going to see an incredibly entertaining game.</p>
<p>There should be plenty of goals on both ends, with the visitors probably winning the game. Still, we don’t think they’re going to beat Real Madrid with a big enough advantage to knock the champs out of the competition.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool to win &amp; over 3.5 goals</p>
