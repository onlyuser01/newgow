<p>Hello Player37!</p>
<p>I'm also from Austria and maybe I can help you.</p>
<p>Amazing that the bank is causing you problems, you rarely hear that.</p>
<p>May I ask which bank you are with?</p>
<p>Bawag, Bank Austria, Erste Bank, Raiffeisenbank, Volksbank?</p>
<p>So on the face of it and thought I would suggest that at every casino you should void the withdrawals (if it is still possible)</p>
<p>otherwise the money will end up back at the casino if your bank declined it.</p>
<p>I would recommend that if these casinos offer Skrill, you create an account and request withdrawals via Skrill.</p>
<p>You can order a credit card via Skrill for â‚¬10, which you can then use without your bank noticing anything about the transactions. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>For example, you withdraw your winnings via Skrill and then use the Skrill card to withdraw those winnings.</p>
<p>So your bank doesn't know much.</p>
<p>If they don't have Skrill let me know what payment methods they have so I can help you further.</p>
<p>There is a solution for everything, don't worry.</p>
<p>As for your bank, I would take it seriously, as you know how strict they are with finances in Austria.</p>
<p>You could talk to your advisor, but if they were to send a message with a reminder, I would personally try to disburse the funds elsewhere before I seek the conversation.</p>
<p>I can imagine that some payouts for your bank come from dubious providers, which is why they cause you problems but this is only a guess.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
