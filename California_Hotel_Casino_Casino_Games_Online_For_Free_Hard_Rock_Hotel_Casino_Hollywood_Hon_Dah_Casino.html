<p>Spotlight Sports Group, a company focused on sports technology, content, and media, is shining the spotlight on itself once again. The company has teamed up with Spain-based Diario AS to promote the latter’s activities in the sports realm.</p>

<p>Diario AS is a sports publisher that has been reporting on soccer and other sports since 1967. It is behind several publications and online sites, including AS.com.</p>
<p>Spotlight, which operates Racing Post, is now bringing its expertise to Diario AS. The objective is to provide the latter with Spanish sports betting content, and technology and artificial intelligence-based content.</p>
<p>This partnership positions Spotlight Sports Group as a leading provider of sports betting affiliate and engagement technology across the global publishing sector,” Spotlight MD (Sport) &amp; co-US CEO Harry von Behr stated.</p>
<p>Diario AS is a subsidiary of media conglomerate PRISA. The company has a long list of newspapers, television networks, and radio stations throughout Spain.</p>
<p>Tapping into Diario AS could give Spotlight access to additional resources controlled by those assets, expanding its portfolio even more. There are already hints at betting becoming a primary component of sports coverage in the US within a few years.</p>
<p>Eyes on the US</p>
<p>The enhancements would also potentially make it more attractive for deep-pocketed investors out of the US. With multibillion-dollar public launches occurring in the sports betting space, Spotlight could have an eye on the same.</p>
<p>Spotlight already supplies its solutions in over 70 languages across the globe. It works with some of the largest sportsbooks in the industry and has been building out its B2B operations as well.</p>
<p>It launched its Publisher Solution Suite in September, offering new options that include enhanced widgets and affiliate marketing options.</p>
<p>Several months ago, Spotlight also acquired California-based FA Media LLC, the company behind Alarm Sports Network. It is also linked with sports betting content provider Pickwise. These relationships have allowed the company to strengthen its US foundation, which will help it expand deeper into the market.</p>
<p>Spotlight Looks to Global Audience</p>
<p>Spotlight claims it is working to develop a global presence that will allow it to dominate the sports betting industry. It has recently beefed up its range of products to help it reach that goal.</p>
<p>The claimed improvements and enhanced global position might not just be to give it more status. There has been talk that Exponent, the private equity company behind Spotlight, might be willing to entertain a sale.</p>
