    <h1>Fremont Casino Las Vegas New Sweeps Casinos Arizona Charlie S Boulder Casino Hotel Barona Valley Ran</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming continues to expand its aggregation platform through its dedicated Powered by Relax partnership program. The company is now adding products by Evoplay which will be accessible to casinos that are using content through Powered by Relax and wish to introduce high-value-added games to their portfolios.</p>
<p>Evoplay Becomes Latest Powered by Relax Partner</p>
<p>Evoplay has a strong reputation for being one of the most innovative suppliers in iGaming, bringing a number of excellent titles that are crafted to appeal to different tastes and buck traditional gameplay and development practices.</p>
<p>The company has already won multiple awards for its Dungeon: Immortal Evil, an RPG-inspired hack’n’slash video slot, and Star Guardians, another innovative, third-person shooter game that enables players to experience iGaming in fresh and exciting ways.</p>
<p>EGR Marketing and Innovation Awards and SBC Awards have both distinguished Evoplay for its innovative approach to the industry and constant dedication to the sector. Evoplay will deploy its full range of slot, table, and instant games – some 160 titles – through Powered by Relax and help partner casinos to access high-performing and successful games in real time.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity Relax Gaming CEO Simon Hammon said that the company was excited to be adding Evoplay to its partner network. He said:</p>
<p>Its fresh approach to game development and partner-personalized game offerings makes it the perfect addition to our Powered by Relax program. Relax Gaming CEO Simon Hammon</p>
<p>Hammon assured that both Relax and Evoplay are committed to expanding their reach and growth in regulated gaming markets.</p>
<p>Regulated iGaming Markets Remain Top Priority</p>
<p>Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi confirmed that the company was happy to be joining this opportunity with Relax and ensure that Evoplay games can reach top-tier providers across the entire iGaming spectrum. He continued:</p>
<p>Our recent deal with Relax is one of Evoplay’s long-anticipated commercial milestones for 2022, for which we prepared the absolute best gaming and promotional tools available. As a result, I’m fired up, incentivized, and inspired about the upcoming projects soon to be launched with Relax Gaming. Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has been striking partnerships with important stakeholders in the iGaming sector for the past months now. The company recently teamed up with Quantum Gaming, a white-label, turnkey platform supplier. Both Evoplay and Relax Gaming are committed to expanding their footprints in regulated markets and introducing new online casino gaming experiences to customers in those jurisdictions.</p>
