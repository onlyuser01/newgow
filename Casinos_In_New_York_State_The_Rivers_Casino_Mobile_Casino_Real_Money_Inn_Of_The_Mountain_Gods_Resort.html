<p>The challenger online casino brand PlayStar has signed a partnership with the leader in compliance and geolocation, Xpoint. The agreement will establish Xpoint as PlayStar’s official geolocation partner.</p>
<p>Xpoint Will Assist PlayStar With Compliance and Engagement</p>
<p>As per the deal, Xpoint will assist PlayStar by helping it secure its offerings, comply with the regulations of the local gambling authorities, and provide its customers with a safe betting experience.</p>
<p>Xpoint will collaborate with PlayStar and its business development and marketing teams and will help them to increase the company’s appeal to customers.</p>
<p>The geolocation brand will use its tech and data platform to help PlayStar boost fan engagement and retention. This partnership comes ahead of PlayStar’s official New Jersey launch that is scheduled for the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>PlayStar is Sure it Can Make a Change</p>
<p>PlayStar welcomed its new partner. The company’s chief executive officer, Per Hellberg, said that he is delighted to name Xpoint as his company’s geolocation provider. Despite PlayStar’s launch in New Jersey still being a few months away, Hellberg is already planning the expansion of the company and launches across various other states. Because of this, Xpoint’s experience with the various markets and regulations will prove invaluable.</p>
<p>Hellberg admitted that both PlayStar and Xpoint will likely meet a lot of adversity as they challenge other, more distinguished brands. However, he is glad to enter this battle with Xpoint by his side:</p>
<p>“This partnership means we stay true to our vision to leverage the most innovative technology in the market to deliver an online casino experience like no other.” PlayStar CEO Per Hellberg</p>
<p>Xpoint seems to feel the same way as Marvin Sanderson, the geolocation company’s chief executive and co-founder, said that he is excited to join forces with PlayStar and its team and be a part of PlayStar’s vision of revolutionizing the market.</p>
<p>Sanderson is convinced that PlayStar is a brand that is capable of bringing that innovation, thanks to the fresh thinking of its team and its robust core values:</p>
<p>“It is going to be a major player in the U.S. market as they launch in New Jersey and then expand across America. We are delighted to be partnering with their team, and are excited to be part of what promises to be an exciting future for PlayStar and its customers.”</p>
<p>This isn’t the only deal that Xpoint has managed to score in those last few weeks. In December last year, the geolocation company inked another partnership with the sports trading platform Sporttrade.</p>
