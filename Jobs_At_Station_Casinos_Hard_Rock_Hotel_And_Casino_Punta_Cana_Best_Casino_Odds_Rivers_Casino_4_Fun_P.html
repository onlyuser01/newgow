<p>Scatter Monsters review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Scatter Monsters takes players to a ghoulish world of demons, vampires, and zombies.</p>
<p>The flames of hell are close at hand as players navigate an underworld of adorably horrible monsters. In this perilous realm, players will need to keep their wits about them to escape the wrath of supernatural creatures.</p>
<p>Fans of macabre imagery and players looking for a whimsical vibe will especially appreciate this slot.</p>
<p>Win in the Scatter Monsters slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Players enter the slot through the mouth of a skull with fangs that suggest it belonged to a monster. The setting is a cartoon vision of hell, with catlike demons perched on mounds of brimstone.</p>
<p>Among the symbols there is a range of tiny supernatural beings. Child-like vampires with purple skin, sleepy zombies, and fiery-mouthed demons are all among the cast. Most of these monstrous characters are more cute than terrifying.</p>
<p>Upon wins, the color drains from the little monster symbols as their souls are drained. In the foreground, players may notice the tails and heads of horned demons watching the gameplay.</p>
<p>Scatter Monsters offers a moody, rock soundtrack that brings to mind bands of the ‘70s. The reels land with a gentle echo, upholding the sense of cavernous space.</p>
<p>Together, the animation and soundtrack create a lighthearted take on eternal torment.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Scatter Monsters is a six-reel, six-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols anywhere on the reels. The size of the prize is determined by the type of symbol and the number that have landed.</p>
<p>The swift gameplay ensures that this slot will hold the player’s attention.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Three Soul Meters are placed beside the reels where the ‘Souls’ of winning symbols are collected. Once filled with a designated number of ‘Souls’, these Meters provide special features as follows:</p>
<p>When 20 Vampire Souls are collected in the Vampire Soul Meter, low-paying symbols of every color are transformed into the high-paying version.</p>
<p>are collected in the Vampire Soul Meter, low-paying symbols of every color are transformed into the high-paying version. When 40 Zombie Souls are collected in the Zombie Soul Meter, every symbol of a randomly selected color is taken off the reels.</p>
<p>are collected in the Zombie Soul Meter, every symbol of a randomly selected color is taken off the reels. When 60 Demon Souls are collected in the Demon Meter, the Free Spins feature begins. In the event that players overfill the Demon Meter, they are awarded an additional free spin for every 25 extra Demon Souls. If any Demon Souls are left after all free spins are awarded, these Souls are made into a multiplier ranging from 1x to 20x.</p>
<p>When a Heavens Gift symbol appears on the reels, it can entirely fill a Soul Meter.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols with the exception of the Heavens Gift symbol.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Scatter Monsters is 96.08%, just about our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>Paytable for high paying symbols</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>Scatter Monsters offers medium volatility, making it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We suggest a strategy of targeting the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, medium volatility supernatural creature-themed slot.</p>
<p>With enticing bonuses and a colorfully quirky animation, Scatter Monsters is an engaging slot.</p>
<p>However, the moderate RTP and volatility of Scatter Monsters will be somewhat less appealing to mathematically-inclined players.</p>
