<p>We’ve all heard about YouTube boxing, but what about tech billionaire cage fighting? That might become a thing if Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg come true on their promise to fight each other in an MMA bout</p>
<p>In a recent interview with MZ Sports, UFC boss Dana White confirmed that the two billionaires aren’t joking about their MMA fight. He claims that he’s been talking with both Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk about setting up a fight.</p>
<p>So, how did the two get the idea to fight in the first place? It all started with a seemingly harmless tweet by the Twitter owner, who commented on Zuckerberg’s company Meta and its new social media project “Threads.” A user joked that Musk should take it easy with Zuckerberg as the Facebook creator knows jiu-jitsu, to which the South African billionaire replied, “I’m up for a cage match if he is lol.”</p>
<p>One would’ve thought that the talk about the Zuckerberg vs. Musk fight would end there, but no. Instead, Zuckerberg decided to get involved, posting a picture of Musk’s tweet on Instagram with a caption saying, “Send me location.” And he did! Musk replied: “Vegas Octagon,” suggesting that he wants to fight under MMA rules in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>It’s Obvious Why Musk is the Betting Underdog</p>

<p>Elon Musk is 12 years older than his social media rival and is not famous for his athleticism. He’s a couple of inches taller than Zuckerberg, but he also weighs almost 25 pounds more. Unfortunately for him, those pounds do not come from muscle mass but from fat.</p>
<p>One advantage he might have over his American rival is that he’s got some experience with karate and taekwondo, which, by default, should make him a better striker than Zuckerberg who’s all about grappling.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan Thinks Zuckerberg is Actually Pretty Good at BJJ</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is a self-professed aficionado of Brazilian jiu-jitsu who’s been practising this martial art for years. He took part in a couple of tournaments, even winning two medals as revealed on Joe Rogan’s podcast.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also has some experience with kickboxing, with his training footage being praised by UFC legends like Conor McGregor, Michael Bisping, and others.</p>
<p>He also looks ripped and being 12 years Musk’s junior means that he probably has a much superior gas tank than his nemesis.</p>
<p>Musk vs. Zuckerberg MMA Prediction</p>
<p>My Elon Musk vs. Mark Zuckerberg prediction is that it’s not going to happen. But if it does come to fruition, Zuckerberg is going to win easily. He’s younger, stronger, faster, and most importantly, way more skillful than Musk in terms of martial arts. In fact, he’s so superior to Musk that I think he’d finish him easily in round 1.</p>
<p>Pick: Mark Zuckerberg to win by submission in round 1</p>
