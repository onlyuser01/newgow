<p>Kensei Blades review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Kensei Blades has a fantasy anime theme.</p>
<p>Players will be transported to an ethereal forest filled with emblems and medieval magic. With the help of an iconic knight and a tough-looking enchantress, they’ll head out on a quest.</p>
<p>Kensei Blades is a good pick for fans of anime and those interested in multi-player role-playing games.</p>
<p>Wins can be awarded either from left or right side</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The ambient sounds of birds will make Kensei Blades players feel like they are wandering through an otherworldly forest. A delicate soundtrack of whistling notes adds a sense of mysticism to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will find glowing crystal stars, hearts, and moons as well as golden suns, swords, and mysterious characters. The style of the animation has a classic anime look that fans will recognize and enjoy.</p>
<p>On one side of the reels, a young knight in ornate armour stares out, his hand on his sword. On the other side of the reels, a young pink-haired enchantress is poised, holding her magical staff firmly.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, players will see an idyllic world of greenery and a blue sky that makes heading out on a quest tempting.</p>
<p>The soundtrack and graphics combine to create a dreamy anime fantasy.</p>
<p>Scatter win in the Kensei Blades slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Kensei Blades has a 3-4-5-4-3 reel structure.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded to players for landing matching reels in any positions on adjacent reels from left to right and from right to left.</p>
<p>Only the longest combination of symbols is paid out on a given spin.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbols and the Free Spin symbols. The Wild symbol only lands on reels 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p>If players land a Free Spin symbol on every reel, the Free Spins feature begins and a prize is awarded. Every time players land a combination of 5 Free Spins symbols across the reels, they are awarded 8 free spins.</p>
<p>In total players can be awarded as many as 96 free spins in a given win. Including possible retriggers, the total number of free spins in one game round is capped at 240.</p>
<p>3 win ways give the player 24 free spins</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Scatter symbols, they are awarded a win of x2 their total bet. Landing 4 Scatters awards x10 their bet, and landing 5 Scatters awards x50 their bet.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.12%, below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€1.00 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin.</p>
<p>With medium volatility, Kensei Blades is a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Kensei Blades slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, medium volatility anime fantasy slot.</p>
<p>Though the theme and animation are aesthetically pleasing, Kensei Blades offers an RTP that is simply too low to merit a strong recommendation.</p>
<p>Mathematically minded players will also likely remain unmoved by Kensei Blades’s moderate volatility.</p>
<p>Some enthusiastic anime fantasy fans may enjoy stopping by Kensei Blades, but they’d do well to move on to slots that can offer them a more favorable RTP.</p>
