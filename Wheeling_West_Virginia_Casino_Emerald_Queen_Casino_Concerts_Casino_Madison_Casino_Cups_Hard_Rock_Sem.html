<p>Las Vegas Strip Gaming Revenue Declines 9.25 Percent in October, Reduced Hold Blamed</p>

<p>Casinos on the Las Vegas Strip saw their gross gaming revenue (GGR) decline 9.25 percent last month, with poor hold and a lethargic convention calendar blamed for the win fall.</p>

<p>Strip casinos won $538.5 million, roughly $55 million less than they did in the same month in 2018. Reduced hold on blackjack and baccarat was cited for the downturn, as was a lackluster convention period.</p>
<p>The good news was that statewide GGR eclipsed the $1 billion mark for a second straight month. The $1 billion threshold has been hit six times in 2019: February, March, June, July, September, and October.</p>
<p>However, October’s collective haul of $1.02 billion marked a 3.85 percent year-over-year decline. Along with the Strip, casino win was down 5.5 percent in Laughlin to $44.5 million, and down 3.3 percent in North Las Vegas to $26.4 million.</p>
<p>There were some bright spots. Downtown Las Vegas continued to shine. GGR there was up 7.2 percent to $68.3 million. Gaming on the Boulder Strip grew negligibly (0.2 percent) to $78.5 million, and 7.3 percent in Mesquite to $12.2 million.</p>
<p>The October report is a disappointing follow-up to September, which marked the state’s all-time best performance for the month. Strip GGR came in at $584.2 million – a seven percent premium.</p>
<p>Spooky Numbers</p>
<p>Nevada GGR was down for several key games in October 2019 vs. 2018.</p>
<p>Blackjack win totaled $92.2 million last month, down substantially from 2018’s $125.5 million. Baccarat also suffered, with win on the table game coming in at $56.7 million, a nearly $20 million reduction from October 2018.</p>
<p>The house fared well in October 2018, blackjack and baccarat hold respectively 18 percent and nine percent. In October 2019, those holds were 15 percent and eight percent.</p>
<p>Roulette plummeted 30 percent to $28.1 million, and craps win was flat at $31.7 million. Some of the table game losses were offset by a 5.8 percent GGR gain on penny slots, which delivered casinos $318.5 million. Higher denomination slots, however, disappointed.</p>
<p>Jointly, slot machines reported a GGR gain of 0.8 percent, the terminals accounting for $699 million of Nevada’s $1.02 billion October win – nearly 70 percent.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Tops NJ</p>
<p>New Jersey oddsmakers are quick to point out how fast they’ve been able to compete with – and, in some months, overtake – Nevada in terms of overall sports betting handle and subsequent win. But in October, the Silver State came out on top of the Garden State.</p>
<p>Nevada sportsbooks won $47.88 million last month, slightly beating New Jersey’s $46.39 million.</p>
<p>Football was responsible for the lion’s share of sports betting revenue, oddsmakers keeping $26.1 million on pigskin outcomes. Baseball, fueled by a thrilling World Series that went seven games between the Houston Astros and eventual underdog winners Washington Nationals, was next at $11.4 million.</p>
