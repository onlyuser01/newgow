<p>Kwiff, a super-charged betting service, has unveiled a new partnership with the mobile measurement and analytics suite Adjust. As a result, the latter company will supply kwiff with solutions that will help it grow its native apps.</p>
<p>To that end, Adjust will power kwiff’s iOS and Android apps with its SDK solution, helping the betting company optimize acquisition. Thanks to the integration, kwiff will also be able to more accurately measure its users’ behavior.</p>
<p>The companies announced that, at first, the service will only focus on tracking organic traffic across multiple events. Eventually, kwiff will extend the service to cover paid traffic for Apple Search Ads, Social campaigns and In-app display ads.</p>
<p>Kwiff noted that it conducted a competitive research process before deciding on a partner. In the end, the betting service determined that Adjust has a clear edge over its competitors because of its coding and technology.</p>
<p>Adjust will be instrumental to maximizing kwiff’s returns and helping the company achieve its performance targets. The former company will leverage its tech to drive traffic and help kwiff inspire brand loyalty.</p>
<p>The new deal will complement kwiff’s existing affiliate marketing partnership with Income Access, adding an extra layer of acquisition to the company. It comes a few weeks after kwiff confirmed the extension of its racing partnership with BetMakers.</p>
<p>Adjust Is Glad to Have Been Chosen by Kwiff</p>
<p>Adjust’s vice president of EMEA, Alexandre Pham, commented on the agreement, saying that his team feels honored to have been selected by kwiff. Adjust will therefore do everything in its power to respond to kwiff’s expectations and accelerate the growth of the gambling company’s mobile apps.</p>
<p>At Adjust, we know how fundamental effective measurement and optimization is to the success of mobile apps, so we are excited to see kwiff utilize this insight to drive traffic and acquire new players. Alexandre Pham, VP EMEA, Adjust</p>
<p>Charles Lee, kwiff’s chief executive officer, also shared his thoughts. He noted that the native kwiff app is designed to reflect the company’s commitment to a mobile-first experience and provide players with a seamless sports betting journey.</p>
<p>Working with Adjust means we can now acquire players through the app stores to complement our web traffic strategies. Charles Lee, CEO, kwiff</p>
<p>Kwiff’s ambition is to streamline its apps so that players are never taken through unnecessary steps.</p>
<p>In spite of its best intentions, however, kwiff recently came under fire in the UK where it allegedly released promotional material on a web page directed at young football fans.</p>
