    <h1>Suquamish Clearwater Casino Resort Best Casino In Laughlin Hotels Near Winstar World Casino How To P</h1>

<p>Good afternoon, I hereby warn all online players of this casino to pay attention to certain situations. I played in this casino for some time and had a great impression of it at all levels. The worst was when problems arose that I describe below.1- I was recently blocked for 4 days in the double double bonus poker game, but I had access to all the games except this one, I asked for clarification and they couldn't say anything, after 4 days I got access again. I verified after contacting players that they always had access to this game, I think I was blocked for having won large amounts and when I returned to play I noticed right away that the game had been changed. 2- I had asked support because they do not give direct access to the deposit limits made by us and I asked for a weekly deposit limit of 3750 euros, they confirmed I trusted and never checked. In the week of June 26th to July 3rd, out of curiosity I went to see the volume of deposits and saw that I had made deposits in the amount of 5010 euros, I complained to the casino and asked why they had not blocked at 3750 euros. I asked the casino to return 1260 euros of the excess, many days passed they said they didn't have this function after all, despite being written in Responsible Gaming. Every day I asked for the return of the excess deposited. Finally they put the 1260 euros in the account. I tried to withdraw but I couldn't and they said that this money of mine had to be wagered once in total, I replied that the money was not a bonus but my money. After many days they had the audacity to say that in order to withdraw this MINE money I would have to give them a commission of 20 percent. Tired of this situation I agreed and finally I raised 1008 euros. Conclusion all goes well until problems arise of their own fault Be careful with these situations. In the casino there is an excellent professional named Mr Levan who always tries to solve situations, but is limited in his actions. In the end they closed my account cowardly without giving me any explanations. Beware of this casino.</p>
