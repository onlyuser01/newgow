    <h1>Golden Nugget Hotel Casino Las Vegas Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort Largest Casino In The Us Candyland</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming has made it abundantly clear that the United States is where suppliers ought to focus their efforts if they wish to be future-proof and competitive. Now, the company which develops innovative in-house content and aggregates third-party games, has made its play for the market by debuting its content offer with BetMGM in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The company has been granted a vendor transactional waiver from the local regulator, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, and will now operate its local RLX Gaming division that is set on taking the company’s product live across one of the most lucrative markets in the country.</p>
<p>This comes at a time of rapid expansion of iGaming efforts in the United States, although admittedly not that many states offer iGaming just yet. The new license and rollout also follow a similar move in Ontario, Canada, with BetMGM now benefiting from titles such as Epic Joker and The Great Pigsby among the first titles to grace its content library that bear the Relax Gaming signature.</p>
<p>More games are to follow, with Relax Gaming confident that it would achieve differentiation and stand out in BetMGM’s library which already includes a massive selection of 1,500 titles. Commenting on this opportunity, BetMGM VP of Gaming Product &amp; Content Oliver Bartlett said that the addition of Relax Gaming was indeed a significant milestone for the company, and a great step forward for both partners.</p>
<p>"We are honored to be first the operator in the states to bring their diverse and engaging portfolio of games to our award-winning online casino," Bartlett explained. Relax Gaming CEO Simon Hammon was similarly pleased with what he described as a landmark opportunity.</p>
<p>He described the present launch in New Jersey as the biggest to date, echoing the company’s own words that the US market will indeed be one of the most significant for any supplier moving forward.</p>
<p>Securing this groundbreaking entry is a way to demonstrate this. As to Relax Gaming’s Chief Regulatory Officer, Alexia Smilovic, she was equally excited to see this new opportunity unfold for her company. "This regulatory achievement reflects our commitment to meeting stringent US licensing requirements and provide best in class service on all fronts to local operators," Smilovic said.</p>
