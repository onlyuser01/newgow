<p>The fast-growing provider of innovative casino games and promotional tools, Kalamba Games, unveiled details regarding its latest spooky slot game called Wilds From The Crypt. On Thursday, the iGaming developer confirmed that the new 6×4 reel game tells the story of a supernatural family, while at the same time boosting engagement with thrilling features such as wilds and multipliers.</p>
<p>The release of Wilds From The Crypt comes after Kalamba Games introduced its first crash game last month. At the time, the iGaming supplier released Deep Rush, its first game within the crash genre that has been enjoying strong popularity within the online gambling sector for some time now.</p>

<p>“Wilds From The Crypt will appeal to both new and existing fans of our high-quality content offering.“ Alex Cohen, COO and co-founder at Kalamba Games</p>
<p>Back in June, Kalamba Games announced the release of Blazing Bull Remastered, a sequel to its popular 6×4 game series that brings progressive free spins bonus and wild multipliers via three HyperBet levels.</p>
<p>The 6×4 Reel Slot Brings Scatters, HyperBet</p>
<p>In the iGaming developer’s latest release, Wilds From The Crypt, wild symbols can substitute all base game symbols on the reels. Additionally, the high volatility slot game offers a Lucky Loops feature that grants players a chance to summon a special Purple Ghost Wild on every 10th spin via the collection of potions. “Split into three sections, every third potion grants a wild reel, adding it to the game board and resetting after the tenth spin,” explains Kalamba Games.</p>
<p>Players that land three scatters can tap into a bonus round that features sticky wilds throughout all further spins. This functionality grants players a chance for big payouts considering that multipliers are attached to the sticky wilds, elevating the experience further.</p>
<p>What’s more, the new spooky slot delivers the iGaming developer’s fan-favorite HyperBet feature that grants players personalization options and allows them to control whether the reels within the base game have a multiplier. The feature also provides options for customization within the free spins round.</p>
