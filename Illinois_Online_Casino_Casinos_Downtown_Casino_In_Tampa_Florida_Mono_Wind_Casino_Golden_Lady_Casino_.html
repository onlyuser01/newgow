<p>Pariplay has continued to grow its prominent partner program, strengthening its reach through the addition of prominent betting and gaming brands</p>
<p>The latest partnership will allow BoyleSports to benefit from the launch of dedicated and proprietary content from Wizard Games through the Fusion platform. This new content launch will strengthen BoyleSports’ operations in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Fusion will not just stop at content by Wizard Games, though, as the platform is also expected to deliver on more than 14,000 products, part of its aggregation platform presently. Apart from aggregating content, Pariplay has been equally keen on adding new clients which can benefit from its curated offer of iGaming products.</p>
<p>The Fusion platform does not just offer games, though, as it creates powerful experiences backed by the company’s back and front-end tools that boost conversion and retention. Some of the solutions Pariplay deploys include its Fusion Tournaments, Raffle Rocket, and Spin that Wheel promotional tools.</p>
<p>Bringing New Games and Experiences to BoyleSports Players</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership BoyleSports gaming director Steve Payne has hailed the opportunity to add a trusted and reliable partner such as Pariplay, capable of bringing some of the best titles to the operator. Payne added:</p>
<p>We’re very happy to see key games go live in the UK and Ireland, as we look to further grow our footprint in our core markets and beyond.</p>
<p>Pariplay VP of sales Andrew Maclean was similarly pleased with the partnership and said that the company was delighted to be teaming up with BoyleSports, a brand that is “supremely well-known in the UK and Irish markets.</p>
<p>“Taking both proprietary content and third-party games live across multiple jurisdictions highlights the agility and scalability of our Fusion platform,” Maclean added. Pariplay has been working to actively strengthen its partner and third-party programs as well as strike important partnerships with prominent brands.</p>
<p>The company has been able to add Jelly Entertainment to its Ignite program earlier in February. Similarly, the company added Mancala Gaming as one of its latest Fusion platforms, seeking to expand its list of new titles. The company also struck a partnership with Kiron this year.</p>
