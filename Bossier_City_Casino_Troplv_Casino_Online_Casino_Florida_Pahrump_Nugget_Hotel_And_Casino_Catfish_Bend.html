<p>Popular live scores website Flashscore announced it has launched a brand new service seeking to keep soccer fans informed during the upcoming FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
<p>Synergy of Content</p>
<p>Flashscore News, a brand new section on the website, will feature original content provided by its editorial staff, as well as articles from popular news agencies to make sure fans of soccer do not miss a single piece of information related to the World Cup matches.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Alan Zaruba, director of content at Flashscore’s parent company Livesport, outlined that the plan for Flashscore News is to leverage game data and statistics and provide statistical analysis rich on visualizations.</p>
<p>In addition, the new section will feature multimedia content, opinions from team officials and sports fans, blogs by experts, live audio commentaries of all the matches, as well as “a video magazine at the end of each day providing a summary of the results and statistics,” to create a go-to virtual place for fans of the sport.</p>
<p>“The big advantage for us is that we can share news information, and interesting sports stories, in context with data across 14 different newsrooms with a proper global reach,” Zaruba continued, convinced that “sharing content between markets with different cultures, languages, and customs” creates a synergy that will prove to be a huge asset for the business and a great benefit to Flashscore users.</p>
<p>Previews, Analyses, Stats</p>
<p>The news section on the website will provide fans with an analytical preview of every match of the World Cup tournament to keep users informed about the key updates before kick-off.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there will be an analysis of each team and its chances to progress further in the tournament, while for those who prefer to have a historical overview of previous meetings between the two teams the section will provide detailed stats from Flashscore’s partner platform Stats Perform.</p>
<p>Flashscore will also allow those soccer fans who cannot watch the matches from the World Cup on TV to listen to Flashscore’s live audio commentary which will be available for every match of the tournament.</p>
<p>The launch of Flashscore News will further strengthen the position of the live scores service provider which attracts more than 100 million users every month providing them with the fastest and most reliable results and statistics.</p>
<p>The editorial staff and the team of professional commentators based in Flashscore’s offices in the UK are ready to walk the extra mile and make sure that fans do not miss a single detail from the World Cup.</p>
