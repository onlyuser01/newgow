<p>The international sports betting and gambling company Entain has taken a blow to its director team after Peter Isola announced his leave from the board.</p>
<p>Isola Leaves the Board</p>
<p>Isola used to serve as a non-executive director but has now decided to quit the company. The departure leaves Entain with ten active directors.</p>
<p>Isola joined the company back in February 2016 and has since served as a non-executive director. His six-year term saw him assist Entain’s expansion, helping it grow its business and reach new markets. As a part of Entain, Isola used to work alongside the Audit, Remuneration, and ESG Committees. Isola played a key role in many of Entain’s M&amp;A deals thanks to his intimate understanding of the law.</p>
<p>As someone with decades of experience, Isola was a strong addition to Entain’s list of directors. He has long years of experience as a Senior Partner of ISOLAS LLP and as chairman of Fiduciary Group. He is also the non-executive director of BetVictor and Gibraltar International Bank.</p>
<p>All and all, Isola is a renowned figure when it comes to financial and iGaming law. Because of this, his leave is a significant loss for Entain. The ex-director said that he will now focus on other opportunities.</p>
<p>Entain Wished Isola All the Best</p>
<p>Entain’s chairman, Barry Gibson, thanked Isola for his invaluable contributions to the company. Gibson said that the whole team is thankful to have worked alongside the ex-director for the last six years. The chairman wished his former colleague the best of luck in his future endeavors.</p>
<p>With Isola out of the company, Entain’s board of directors has been round down to 10 members. Those include the following:</p>
<p>Barry Gibson, non-executive chairman</p>
<p>Jette Nygaard-Andersen, chief executive officer</p>
<p>Rob Wood, chief financial officer and deputy CEO</p>
<p>Robert Hoskin, chief governance officer</p>
<p>Stella David, Senior independent non-executive director</p>
<p>Pierre Bouchut, non-executive director</p>
<p>Mark Gregory, non-executive director</p>
<p>Vicky Jarman, non-executive director</p>
<p>Virginia McDowell, non-executive director and designated workforce director</p>
<p>David Satz, non-executive director</p>
<p>Entain’s business suffered some losses because of the COVID-19 pandemic but is now steadily recovering. A week ago, the company’s operations received a further boost as it grew its roster of partners with the addition of GlobalBet.</p>
<p>Entain recently demonstrated its commitment to a safer gambling ecosystem as it updated its Gamble Responsibly America application. Entain does not only support responsible gambling in America, though. In February, the British charity GambleAware listed Entain as one of its top contributors.</p>
