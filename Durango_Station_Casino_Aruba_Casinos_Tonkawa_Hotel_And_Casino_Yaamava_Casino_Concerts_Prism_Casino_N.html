    <h1>Durango Station Casino Aruba Casinos Tonkawa Hotel And Casino Yaamava Casino Concerts Prism Casino N</h1>

<p>Buenas tardes.</p>
<p>On 07/02/2022, I won the sum of $1,200,000, I made a withdrawal, verifying on 07/05/2022. On 07/13/2022 they inform me that the withdrawal failed, returning the money to the account and having to do the process again.</p>
<p>On 07/13/2022, I had $1,200.00 in my account again, but on 07/14/2022 my account only had the amount of $44,000, and the $1,200,000 was no longer there.</p>
<p>I started looking for information about what had happened and it said in the manual withdrawal history, for which I wrote to online assistance and they told me that the earnings of the no deposit bonus that I activated had been readjusted. Later I contacted support and they answered the same thing.</p>
<p>I had $1,200,000 ready to withdraw. And the casino gives me a promotion that said "gift" I thought that due to the winnings they had given it to me and after playing them, the casino withdrew $1,160,000, leaving me the sum of $44,000 noting that the amount had been readjusted to the winnings bonus maximums. But the bonus winnings were $4,000. The $1,200,000 in the account was from previous earnings.</p>
<p>He considered that the casino acted in a deceitful way, with the purpose of losing the winnings previously won.</p>
<p>I believe that an undue discount is being applied that does not comply with the terms and conditions to which they allude. There is thus an erroneous, incorrect interpretation with which they appropriate by deception the money that I had in my account prior to the bonus that according to them "they gave me".</p>
