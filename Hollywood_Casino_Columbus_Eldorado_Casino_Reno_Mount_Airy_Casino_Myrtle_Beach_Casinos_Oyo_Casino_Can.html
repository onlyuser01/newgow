<p>The new OLG Stage at Fallsview Casino, located in Niagara Falls, Ontario, has already hosted a couple of concerts but its official opening will take place on February 25 with a Billy Joel show</p>
<p>Niagara Falls Review reported that the OLG Stage at Fallsview Casino opened its doors to the media for a tour of the new theatre in order to showcase the venue and its unique features.</p>
<p>All 5,000 Seats Are No More Than 150 Feet Away from the Stage</p>
<p>The 5,000-seat theatre was built on top of the Hilton Hotel parking garage and required 685,000 work hours to complete. It cost CAD 130 million ($96 million) and was built in the period from 2017 to 2020.</p>
<p>The new theatre was delayed by the pandemic, which either canceled or postponed several shows. The delay gave designers the chance to fine-tune the venue to optimize the acoustics. OLG spokesman Tony Bitonti explained that there were operational requirements that needed to be addressed and that fine-tuning was necessary, as is the case with all facilities of this size around the world.</p>
<p>The OLG Stage boasts four levels of seating, and no seat is more than 150 feet away from the stage. The facility further features cutting-edge sound and lighting technologies. Two glass-enclosed walkways connect the venue to Fallsview Casino.</p>
<p>To test the sound system, Toronto band The Beaches played an eight-song set for about 100 media members and social media influencers that was followed by a Q&amp;A session. The media were impressed with the 6,400-foot stage and audio system.</p>
<p>The Beaches also praised the sound quality on stage, with drummer Eliza Enman-McDaniel commenting that it was the most notable thing that made an impression on her. Lead singer Jordan Miller said that it felt like being back in high school doing a matinee, while guitarist Kylie Miller suggested that The Beaches were the first all-girl band to play at the new venue. Miller further added she was blown away by the facility, saying that it was new but sounded amazing.</p>
<p>Niagara Casinos President Expects a Visitation Boost Prompted by the New Theatre</p>
<p>According to Niagara Casinos’ President Richard Taylor, the new facility will boost tourism in Niagara, prolong hotel stays, improve customer satisfaction, and attract more visitors to Fallsview Casino.</p>
<p>Senior property asset manager Rob Divencha noted that the new theatre has received positive feedback from the handful of artists who have already played there. The first production to use the new venue was “Canada’s Got Talent,” which rented the OLG Stage for a week in October 2022 to film the show. Since then, the stage has seen concerts by The Lumineers, Don Felder, LIVE, and a few others.</p>
<p>Upcoming shows at the new theatre include Bret Michaels, Rod Stewart, and a grand opening night with Billy Joel. The Fallsview Casino Resort is also home to the 1,500-seat Avalon Theatre, which will remain open despite the new venue opening.</p>
