<p>FanDuel and fuboTV partner to provide odds and betting data</p>
<p>First partnership between OTT and sportsbook</p>
<p>Only horse racing, soccer, and cycling channels featured at first</p>
<p>FanDuel has signed a ground-breaking partnership with OTT streaming service fuboTV to introduce live sports betting data to viewers.</p>
<p>FanDuel Signs with OTT Content Provider fuboTV</p>
<p>Online streaming platform fuboTV has signed a new agreement with fantasy betting agency FanDuel to integrate odds data into the fuboTV streaming service. This is the first time that FanDuel has signed with a third-party over-the-top (OTT) content provider.</p>
<p>FanDuel and fuboTV will be finished integrating the betting data on the platform over the next several weeks, the announcement specified. The companies will seek additional synergies, with FanDuel-owned affiliate horse racing networks, TVG and TVG2 becoming available on fuboTV across the United States. The current offer is limited to just New Jersey, but the companies intend to expand to other states in which sports betting has been legalized.</p>
<p>The companies will include TVG in the standard subscription package while TVG2 will be available for additional $8.99 per month, part of the Sports Plus package. In turn, FanDuel will be the exclusive promoter of fuboTV across all main gambling verticals.</p>
<p>While fuboTV’s network includes 95 channels featuring a range of sports, the companies will integrate the live data feed into just main channels at first. Based on which channels will be available at the start, viewers will receive betting information on horse racing, soccer and cycling.</p>
<p>Adding Value to the Viewer’s Experience</p>
<p>FanDuel VP of Content Business &amp; Operations Adam Kaplan commented on the benefits that viewers and sports fans are going to experience first hand:</p>
<p>“We’re partnering with fuboTV to demonstrate how FanDuel can enhance the live viewing experience by allowing cord-cutting sports fans to view the content that matters to them the most from their TV, phone, tablet or computer.”</p>
<p>Kaplan also added that the pick of fuboTV had been natural and also pointed out that FanDuel was “truly changing the way people watch live sports.” The ultimate goal, Kaplan specified, was to ensure added value for the viewership experience.</p>
<p>While FanDuel and fuboTV broke important ground with their partnership, more similar deals have emerged over the past months. ESPN and Caesars Entertainment struck a partnership to introduce a TV program catering to sports bettors exclusively.</p>
<p>Fox has also struck a deal with the Stars Group and is now moving forward to introduce its own sports betting solution, Fox Bet. Walt Disney Company is also now officially a stake-holder in FanDuel’s rival company DraftKings.</p>
