    <h1>Casinos Arizona Biggest Online Casino Chumash Casino Concerts Casino Apps Sweeps Casinos Fairspin Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Tarryn,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://fairspin.io/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>"Legal Restrictions. The User understands and accepts that online gambling may not be legal in some jurisdictions. We make no representation whatsoever as to the legality of the Services provided by FairSpin. The use of the Services is on the User's sole discretion, option, and risk. Nevertheless, we restrict the use of Fairspin to the Users from the following countries: Aruba, Australia, Belgium, Bonaire, Bulgaria, Colombia, Croatia, Curacao, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Italy, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Spain, St. Maarten, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Ukraine, and/or any other restricted by law country or state.</p>
<p>Use of the Services is unauthorized and unlicensed wherever it is unlawful under applicable law. You may not use the Services at any place or in any manner that would violate any applicable laws and/or regulations. Any offer of any feature, product or service is void where prohibited. Fairspin may limit or deny to any person, in its sole discretion, access to any feature, product or service. You agree that you are not allowed to open an account, nor attempt to use Your Account, if you are resident or located in any of the listed jurisdictions, otherwise your account will be blocked. The company may at its sole discretion make a decision regarding deposit or balance withdrawals or any other funds placed on blocked accounts."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize a very important fact from our Fair Gambling Codex:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries</p>
<p>"The right thing to do is to check for restricted countries during the account creation process, and to not allow players from restricted countries to register and play. If the casino knows about restricted countries and also knows the player's country of residence, it's not a big issue to enforce this rule.</p>
<p>If the casino allows a player from a restricted country to play because it hasn't implemented this check, it should accept that it was the casino's mistake and pay out all winnings to the player despite the fact that they shouldn't have been allowed to play in the first place, provided that the player hasn't done anything else that's against the rules."</p>
<p>Tarryn, I would like to ask you to confirm, that you haven’t used a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to alter your location, when opening the account. Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
