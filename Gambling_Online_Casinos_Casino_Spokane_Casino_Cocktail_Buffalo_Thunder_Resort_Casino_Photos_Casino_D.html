<p>After asking LCS Limited to stop offering its gaming products in the Netherlands, De Kansspelautoriteit (KSA) has awarded its 22nd online gambling license to Holland Gaming Technology. The company currently has its headquarters in Malta and does not yet run any Business-to-Consumer operations. The license was granted following the strict protocols of the country’s remote gambling act (KOA) that was enforced starting April 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Domain Name Still Unknown</p>
<p>Holland Gaming Technology was launched in September 2021. At the moment, it is not known which domain Holland Gaming Technology Ltd will be operating under with the help of its newly obtained license. The domain’s name will be officially published in the Kansspelwijzer, the Netherlands’ online gaming catalog, as soon as it will be known. Holland Gaming’s parent company is Holland Home Entertainment Malta Ltd, while its director is Eddy Petrus Johannes Jacobus Hultermans. Hultermans is also Holland Power Gaming’s director of imaging supplier.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group’s subsidiary Tulipa Ent is one of the latest operators in the Netherlands to receive a license from the KSA. The group is getting ready to launch its flagship ComeOn brand for players in the country. Smart Gaming BV also received a similar license, becoming the 11th Dutch operator to launch in the country after the initial 10 companies that went live once the gaming market was finally regulated and opened last October. There are 19 other operators on the same list of companies with licensed granted by the KSA.</p>
<p>Who Can Obtain A License From the KSA?</p>
<p>The country’s regulator lets interested companies provide online games of chance including online casino games and online betting with the help of a license. Specific requirements must be met by the respective companies looking to apply for a license with the Gaming Authority KSA. Once a license is obtained by a company, the company must get in touch with the Cruks register and connect to it to verify whether their customers are at any risk of dealing with gambling addiction. If this is the case, they must not be allowed to wager. At the same time, for similar reasons, If customers are observed playing either for a long period of time or very often, they need to be stopped or reported to the Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>Operators are strictly prohibited from offering games of chance without the requisite license and facilitating games of chance that do not have a license. At the same time, Dutch players are not allowed to engage in games of chance that are not licensed.</p>
