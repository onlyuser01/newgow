<p>Betting on sports in New Hampshire during August hit $43.4 million, marking a slight increase when compared to July, according to data released by the regulator in the state.</p>
<p>Combined Betting Handle Soars in August, up 20% YoY</p>
<p>The New Hampshire Lottery, the gambling regulator in the state, has announced the unaudited financial results for mobile and retail sports betting in August. Overall, the combined betting handle last month hit $43,372,007. This translates to nearly $4.2 million in gross gaming revenue (GGR). From that total, the state’s revenue share is $1.9 million.</p>
<p>The result from last month, when compared to the result reported a month earlier, in July, marks a slight increase. Back in July, the combined betting handle was $42.7 million. In other words, in August, the betting handle increased by less than 2% when compared to July.</p>
<p>However, a year-over-year comparison shows that the sports wagering handle last month soared. In August 2021, the combined sports betting handle halted at $36,319,740. When compared to the $43.4 reported for the same period this year, an increase of nearly 20% is observed.</p>
<p>The sole operator currently offering retail and mobile sports betting services in New Hampshire is DraftKings. It was back in July 2019 when the state first legalized the activity but it wasn’t until December 2019 when online betting was first launched. On the other hand, in August 2020, the state also introduced legal sports wagering via retail outlets.</p>
<p>Majority of Betting Handle Wagered via Mobile Devices</p>
<p>According to a breakdown by the New Hampshire Lottery, mobile betting was responsible for the majority of the handle last month. In total, DraftKings has seen $32,872,783 in mobile sports betting handle last month, marking a slight decrease when compared to the $33.1 million reported in July. The $32.9 million in mobile betting handle translates to $3.8 million in GGR. The state’s share from that total is $1.8 million, according to the New Hampshire Lottery.</p>
<p>While mobile betting was responsible for the majority of the betting handle, some punters still preferred retail outlets. Last month, $10.5 million was wagered on sports via retail betting locations in New Hampshire. The $10.5 million in retail betting handle represents $386,112 in GGR, of which, $173,750 was the share of the state.</p>
