<p>Finally, Akiona pointed out: "We remain intently focused on leveraging our commitment to capex discipline and working capital efficiency to consistently generate free cash flow, which combined with our operating momentum, should allow for further net leverage reduction in the quarters ahead."</p>

"We delivered another solid quarter of execution in the third quarter, with our product momentum and focused team producing performance that far exceeded the trends observed across the broader domestic gaming landscape," he said.</p>
