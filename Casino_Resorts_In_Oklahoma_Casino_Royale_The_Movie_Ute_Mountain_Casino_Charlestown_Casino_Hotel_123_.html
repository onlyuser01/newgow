<p>Baltimore Ravens Coming to Florida to Grab a Win</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens are the second-best defense in the 2023 NFL, conceding just 16.8 points per game. They’re also great offensively, scoring 27.8 points on average, which makes their offensive team the fourth-best in the league.</p>
<p>Baltimore’s quarterback Lamar Jackson is having his best season in years. His passer rating is 97.7 at the moment, which is his highest number since 2020. The 26-year-old has already thrown for 16 TDs this season, with six of those happening in his last three games.</p>
<p>Jackson is also great when it comes to running the ball, gaining 39 or more yards in each of his last five games. Still, when it comes to rushing touchdowns, Baltimore’s running back Gus Edwards is the leader with 10 TDs.</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars Hoping to Bounce Back to Winning Track</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars lost their last two games, but there’s still no room for panic. They’re still sitting at the top of the AFC South Division with an 8-5 record which is one win more than the Houston Texans and the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
<p>The reason why they shouldn’t worry much is that their last two losses happened by just a couple of points. They lost to the Cincinnati Bengals by a field goal after overtime, as well as to the Cleveland Browns by four points.</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens vs. Jacksonville Jaguars Prediction</p>
<p>Simply put, the Baltimore Ravens are better than the Jacksonville Jaguars. Plus, they’re in much better shape than the Jags right now, the only thing that’s not going in their favor is that Sunday’s game is played in Jacksonville.</p>
<p>That’s why we think this is going to be an entertaining game, but we are confident the visitors will grab a win. Will they cover the spread? We’re not so sure. Of course, it’s not a large spread, but the Jags are going to fight until the end, so maybe they end up losing by just a field goal.</p>
<p>Pick: Baltimore Ravens (-173)</p>
