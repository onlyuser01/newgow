<p>Honey thank you for your response however nobody is understanding what I am saying I am getting very frustrated as I have used all my loyalty points with zar ,,, obviously I have gone and put money into my account I have used bonuses obviously within this case I asked for the 300 first because you could only get 250 then I forfeited that bonus and I carried on with the rest of my gambling in to my account that I put in an additional I want an additional I think it was 1250 i then asked for it to be reversed into my accoung re only needed to the 900 to be back into my account or actually I'll ask you withdraw it in which was the withdrawal request so I don't have that in bonus money nor do I have that in my account so I need somebody To check on this as Megan was probably the most unhelpful human being and I saw in other comments that she has also rubbed people up the wrong way in other cases I know that o saw a few complaints this is not the 1st time so this needs to be resolved either you put it back into my account that I will withdraw it again or this but or something but it has to be my account or reusable either way fix this please Nick because I have absolutely had it now Should I have not asked where my money is was anybody going to say absolutely anything that is my question I do not want anybody using the zar casino going forward I am revolted by the service I received today you are the only one that has actually lost me and tried to understand my case where Megan didn't even bother it was quick to just tell me sorry because it's a little maybe a keyboard Warrior Sorry that you are getting my anger but you know money is money and things are tough at the moment and dealing with people's attitudes like Megan's I'm not OK with it this is my money fair and square so please resolve this this</p>
<p>this not directed at you kindly understand that</p>
