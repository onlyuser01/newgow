<p>Bier Haus review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Bier Haus takes the vision of Germany during Octoberfest and runs with it, offering up Bavarian stereotypes galore in the form of lederhosen, beer steins, mountaintop castles, and busty barmaids dressed in dirndls.</p>
<p>The theme is fun and well realised, with the background setting the slot in the beer cellar of a bar and giving the player plenty of Teutonic tunes to keep them immersed.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are pretty solid, although the symbols are rather small and full of details that can make the reels feel busy and difficult to follow comfortably.</p>
<p>The animations are solid and do their job, although in such a lively slot the creators could certainly have put more creativity into it.</p>
<p>Where the slot shines is the soundtrack. The barroom accordion track of the base game does more than any visual to set the scene and draw the player in. This is really ramped up in the free spins when a chorus of very well ordered bar patrons begin to sing along with the music.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The game mechanics are pretty easy to get the hang of as there is nothing too surprising here. The base game is a five reel slot with four rows. There are forty fixed win lines and many of the symbols come in stacks on the reels.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature and the bonus game is a free spin bonus.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Feature and Gold Feature symbols.</p>
<p>Hitting five or more of Feature and Gold Feature symbols in total on adjacent reels starting from reel one will trigger the Free Spin bonus. Players are awarded five free spins plus five more for every Feature or Gold Feature over five they hit up to a maximum of eighty initial free spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins, any Gold Feature symbols in the triggering spin become sticky Wilds and do not change for the duration of the free spins.</p>
<p>Win of the 20 Free spins in the Bier Haus slot</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.00%, this is exactly average in our estimation. We use a yardstick of "roughly 96%" as our measure for average.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.40 up to a maximum of $/£/€40.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is at the high end of medium, which makes it an alright match for our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Paytable for the BierHaus slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Bier Haus is a decent looking slot from WMS with a fun setting and fully realised world. The decent RTP is a definite point in its favour and the fairly high volatility means we’re pretty happy with it as a candidate for use with our preferred strategies, although there are better options out there in this regard.</p>
<p>The visuals do come off as overcomplicated for a slot that is so simple in practice, but if you can get past that, this is a pretty decent slot.</p>
