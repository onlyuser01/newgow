<p>Barcelona is set to win against Liverpool in UCL Semifinal</p>
<p>Liverpool is on an eight-game winning streak</p>
<p>Barcelona have clinched 16 victories since January 23, including the La Liga finals</p>
<p>The upcoming UCL Semifinal between Barcelona and Liverpool will feature two teams that are natural enemies. Liverpool draws closer to a complete EPL dominance at home, but Barca are given the better chance to win on Wednesday, May 1 2019 at 3:30 PM EST.</p>
<p>Barcelona vs Liverpool UCL Semifinal: Reading the Odds</p>
<p>You will hardly find two teams that are more worthy of the 2019 UEFA Championship League title. Only one must walk away victorious on Wednesday, May 1 when the game takes place at Camp Nou where Barca will host the Anfield team.</p>
<p>With the hosts successfully drubbing Manchester United in an effortless 3-0 game on Thursday, and winning La Liga on Saturday, Liverpool have a worthy opponent to look forward to.</p>
<p>Ernesto Valverde is not underestimating the EPL’s most likely champions either, reminding his team of the dangers that lie ahead. Despite Valverde’s doubts, the sportsbooks continue to support Barca:</p>
<p>Moneyline : Barca: -120/Liverpool: +320</p>
<p>: Barca: -120/Liverpool: +320 Spread : Barca -½, -1 +105/Liverpool -½, +1</p>
<p>: Barca -½, -1 +105/Liverpool -½, +1 Total Points : Barca Ov 3 +102/ Liverpool Un 3 -118</p>
<p>: Barca Ov 3 +102/ Liverpool Un 3 -118 Draw: +225*</p>
<p>Looking at the odds, you must wonder whether this isn’t one of the best value betting opportunities you have had in a while?</p>
<p>Is Jurgen Klopp’s team capable of prying away a victory against Barca the same way his team has managed to dominate the EPL at home?</p>

<p>Clean Series for Both Teams Adds Uncertainty to Wednesday’s Game</p>
<p>Both teams have managed to completely kill it against their recent opponents. FC Barcelona managed to defeat the Red Devils in two consecutive games, giving them no chance to even hope progressing further in the competition.</p>

<p>The addition of the La Liga winwill certainly have the team ecstatic for the next few days, but this is just enough time for Valverde to make his team understand that one of the toughest challenges is to overcome Liverpool on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Liverpool haven’t been doing as well in the UCL as their EPL performance would suggest. UEFA has proven slightly more difficult, with Liverpool knowing defeat one time too many:</p>
<p>Barcelona and Liverpool – UCL Stats 2019 Barcelona Liverpool 7 Wins 6 3 Draws 1 0 Losses 3 23 Goals 18 180 Total Attempts 145 90% Passing accuracy 82% 60% Possession 52%</p>
<p>Liverpool Unstoppable at Home</p>
<p>Despite the signs of weakness in the UCL, Liverpool are still very much a fearsome opponent that is contesting the EPL title at home in the meanwhile. The team has managed to distinct itself in the English Premier League where it played 36 games and lost only one game.</p>
<p>Though worthy of admiration, Liverpool are still faced with somewhat less prominent teams at home as they are in the UEFA crucible.</p>
<p>Still, Manchester City continues to breathe down their necks and with two more fixtures to go, anything can happen.</p>
<p>PEP 💬 We want to win it. We are not going to say: ‘enough, the manager told us how good we are.’ We want to win the Premier League, for sure. Maybe more than last season, to do something unique in this club. pic.twitter.com/4CoqADHfTx — Manchester City (@ManCity) April 27, 2019</p>
<p>As to the head-to-head stats, Barcelona and Liverpool will be meeting for the ninth time. The previous eight games were played between 2001 and 2007, with Liverpool securing three overall victories and two going in the way of Barca. Both teams have scored six goals, though.</p>
<p>Will Firmino Miss Out the Game?</p>
<p>With Roberto Firmino’s injury now possibly leading to a no show against Barca, Klopp’s team is going to have a tough time. Klopp has already confirmed for the Guardian that the Brazilian may miss out on the semifinal first leg, after suffering an injury in the game against Huddersfield.</p>
<p>There are reasons to be skeptical giving the latest developments, but Klopp remained positive to the brim praising his wards for the courage shown in the game on Thursday:</p>
<p>“These boys are outstanding, that’s the reason why we are where we are. Now let’s carry on and we will see where it ends.”</p>
<p>Liverpool Meets Liverpool: Suárez &amp; Coutinho</p>
<p>Formerly Liverpool’s players, Luis Suárez and Philippe Coutinho are now playing versus the team that recruited them and taught them much of what they know.</p>
<p>Even though Coutinho has somewhat failed to stand out alongside Messi and Suárez he is still a reliable and trusted player.</p>
<p>Barca All Set to Dominate</p>
<p>Barcelona’s La Liga victory was one of the most important games so far. The team has not lost a single game since January 23 and has managed to score nine consecutive victories. Liverpool has managed to clinch as many titles as Barca in the Championship League – five.</p>
<p>A brilliant April. 🙌</p>
<p>Let's keep up momentum in May. 👊 pic.twitter.com/us6mPQZsPT — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 27, 2019</p>
<p>However, today Liverpool seems to be somewhat less certain in the UCL with three losses to their name compared to their performance at home. Firmino’s injury is yet another cloud that may not end up with a silver lining. The Anfield’s team seems to be up against a wall, but they are nevertheless determined to keep their momentum.</p>
