    <h1>Harrah S Casino Hotel In New Orleans Mgm Casino Locations Luxor Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Casino Age</h1>

<p>Dear CasinoGuru Team,</p>
<p>I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and concern regarding the recent blocking of my account and withholding of my winnings on 07.10.2023 . My username is hermmzacz12 .</p>
<p>On 05.10.2023, I deposited funds into my account and activated a bonus to play the game "Fruitz" at a wager of 5 euros per spin. Following several rounds of gameplay, I achieved a significant win of 25,000 euros. However, to my disbelief, my account was abruptly blocked without any prior warning or notification.</p>
<p>I immediately contacted customer support through the live chat and was informed that this decision was made by the management. Despite my inquiries, I was not provided with a clear and satisfactory explanation for this action. It is essential for me to understand the reason behind this account suspension and the withholding of my legitimate winnings.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize that throughout my gameplay, I adhered to the terms and conditions set forth by the casino. I did not engage in any prohibited activities or breach any rules that would warrant such a drastic measure.</p>
<p>I request a thorough review of my account activity during the mentioned gameplay period and a justifiable explanation for the sudden account suspension and the withholding of my winnings. Additionally, I kindly ask for the immediate release of my winnings to my registered payment method.</p>
<p>If my concerns are not addressed in a satisfactory manner and my winnings are not released promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter to the appropriate gambling regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to a timely resolution. Please confirm the receipt of this complaint and keep me informed of the progress.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>hermmzacz12.</p>
