    <h1>Hard Rock Hollywood Casino Wind Creek Casino Hotel Wild Horse Casino Lake Of The Torches Casino Lac</h1>

<p>I had created an account on BETWINNER and everything was working well until one day I got blocked. I couldn't place any bets, so I panicked and decided to withdraw as much money as I could... I had a lot of open bets so I couldn't take everything out... About 350 euros remained in this account.</p>
<p>I wrote to them but they provided no solution... Sometimes they gave me silly excuses like, I couldn't email them from a hotmail account, I had to choose another one...</p>
<p>Since that account was blocked (with no possibility to place any bets), I decided to open another one, thinking that I had lost the previous one forever and I deposited 50 euros... As I saw everything was working fine, there was no blockage, I could place bets, everything went well, I thought there must have been some technical error with the other account and I would recover my money in time... I thought Betwinner were honest, but I was mistaken. I decided to deposit 500 more euros and this was when they blocked me. I could only place 2 bets on this account.</p>
<p>I wrote to them and after a tiresome process in which they asked for numerous photos of my documents, selfies, phone bills, income receipts, etc... They finally told me that it's prohibited to have multiple accounts and they have the right to not return my money for this reason alone.</p>
<p>I didn't know that it wasn't allowed to create multiple accounts, especially since when I made the second account, the first one was already blocked and unusable, SO TECHNICALLY I NEVER USED TWO ACCOUNTS at the same time. I operated the first one until they blocked me and I would never have opened a second one if the first one had been functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Please help me recover my money.</p>
