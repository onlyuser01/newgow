<p>Hello Nick thank you for your immediate reply you have been quicker than the casino itself Okay so I submitted my driver's license along with utility bill and a copy of my payment card on December 26th I received an email back January 3rd saying my identification was approved I have spoke with customer service representative everyday twice a day I just spoke with the last one last night and I get the same BS responses that my payment is in the queue and it is the next one to go out but they are so sorry for the untimely delay but I am the next payment to be processed I have heard every excuse from the Bitcoin processor was down to the excuse they needed my Bitcoin address again to then they asked for my identification now the lightest excuse was nobody was there for her to process my payment and then it was it was in the middle of being processed I would have it the next day and we are back to as of last night it's in the queue and they're sorry again for the delay and it'll be right out in the very beginning they told me my payment would be out in 24 to 48 hours and all they asked for was my Bitcoin address and now I have been through pardon my language hell for over 3 weeks for a $75 payment are you kidding me I usually deposit that at more casinos I was trying the casino out I made a small deposit like I do every place else if I get a win I withdraw to see how the process goes see if I want to continue playing there obviously with this one I never want to play there again I've spent a few thousand dollars at other places these people are losing money they could have had a great customer but not now I just want my money so I can be over with this nightmare</p>
