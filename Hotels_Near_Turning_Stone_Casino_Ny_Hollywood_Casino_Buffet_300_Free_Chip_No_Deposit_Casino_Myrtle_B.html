    <h1>Hotels Near Turning Stone Casino Ny Hollywood Casino Buffet 300 Free Chip No Deposit Casino Myrtle B</h1>

<p>So my friend told me about this website, said she had a few bigs win, so started playing back in january, i won twice within a couple of weeks, one £150 and one £350, took a while to pay out think it was about 17 days at least, but got it eventually. on the 5th march i won £2500, and guess what, still no money! all i get it excuses, short messages saying, please be patient etc.</p>
<p>Now ive been doing my research and see this has been happening to people for a couple of years now.</p>
<p>Well im not one to let this go, there has got to be someone we can complain to???</p>
<p>I sent a complaint to the gambling licence, about it been a scam nand they basically said "we know, stay away"</p>
<p>Well lets not helpful, how can they keep trading and ripping people off.</p>
<p>The other thing that gets me the friend who told me about the site literally 2 weeks before won £3,500 and got paid out.</p>
<p>Also i found two other casinos exactly the same, luckywins and spicyjackpots. if you got on the live chat, you get the same operator on each website?!?!?.</p>
<p>I understand its a unlicensed casino but i genuinely didnt know.</p>
<p>I just dont know who to complain to!</p>
<p>Any experiences with them, please share.</p>
<p>Im honestly gutted.</p>
