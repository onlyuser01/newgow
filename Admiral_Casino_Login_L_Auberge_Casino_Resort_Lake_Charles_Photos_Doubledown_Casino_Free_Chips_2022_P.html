<p>The leading global gaming company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced that it has extended its collaboration with one of the largest US bookmakers, SuperBook Sports. The terms of the new collaboration see IGT’s PlaySports platform power the SuperBook Sports mobile betting app in Tennessee.</p>
<p>IGT Extends Collaboration with SuperBook to Tennessee</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent deal, Tennessee is now the fourth US state where the duo has joined forces to deliver an innovative and high-performance sports betting solution. Before Tennessee, IGT and SuperBook joined forces for the mobile betting market in Arizona and New Jersey. What’s more, SuperBook also leverages IGT’s PlaySports technology solution to power its mobile and retail operations for customers in Colorado.</p>
<p>“Given SuperBook Sports’ roots and legacy in Nevada, we’ve had an opportunity to watch the enterprise grow from a single, iconic location in Las Vegas, to a growing multi-state sportsbook operator.” Joe Asher, president of sports betting at IGT</p>
<p>IGT’s president of sports betting, Joe Asher, acknowledged the company has seen the growth of SuperBook Sports from one location in Las Vegas to a multi-state operator. Moreover, he explained that the IGT-powered sportsbook which SuperBook will leverage for the market in Tennessee “can scale for any market opportunity and evolve in parallel with player preferences and behaviors.”</p>
<p>“Over the last two years, IGT PlaySports has played a strategic role in helping SuperBook Sports engage sports fans across the U.S. and achieve our growth goals.” Jay Korneygay, executive vice president at SuperBook</p>
<p>Speaking about the new collaboration, SuperBook’s executive vice president, Jay Kornegay, added that the company’s collaboration with IGT proved to be beneficial. He explained that IGT’s PlaySports solution helped the company engage with sports fans around the US. In conclusion, Kornegay said that the company is excited to introduce its mobile sports betting app to Tennessee and engage with sports fans by offering unique promotions.</p>
<p>The Leading Gaming Company Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Earlier this month, IGT agreed to continue providing Kansas State Lottery with infrastructure. As a result, the company inked a 10-year contract extension with the Lottery to offer its INTELLIGEN electronic gaming central system. Before that, in May, IGT joined forces with Harrington Raceway and Casino in Delaware.</p>
<p>Only recently, the company was also named Sports Betting Platform Provider of the Year as a part of the 2021 SBC North America Awards. Currently, IGT offers sports betting solutions to its partners in nearly two dozen US states, as well as Canada.</p>
