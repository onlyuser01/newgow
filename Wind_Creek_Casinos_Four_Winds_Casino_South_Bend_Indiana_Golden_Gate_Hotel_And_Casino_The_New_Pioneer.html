<p>The globally recognized gaming provider powering the land-based and online gambling sectors, Inspired Entertainment, continues to expand its portfolio of games with the addition of two new thrilling titles. The company confirmed on Friday it launched Big Piggy Bank and Bullion Bars Gold Collector, two new online and mobile slot games that bring engaging and rewarding features.</p>
<p>The latest games from Inspired Entertainment further expand the provider's growing portfolio, bringing popular themes and functionalities for the fans of online and mobile slot games. While Big Piggy Bank is described as a cash collector game with a theme that focuses on collecting and filling piggy banks, Bullion Bars Gold Collector features an evergreen gold theme.</p>
<p>Claire Osborne, Inspired Entertainment's Vice President of Interactive, was delighted about the latest additions to the company's portfolio. "Our latest launch lineup is a testament to our unwavering dedication to curating a diverse content portfolio with captivating themes, innovative gameplay features, and top-quality graphics," she explained in a statement.</p>
<p>Osborne added that it is thrilling for players in different jurisdictions across the globe to enjoy games developed by the company. Finally, Inspired's Vice President of Interactive added: "Weâ€™re certain these titles will be a surefire hit and captivate the hearts of gamers seeking a fun and casual online casino experience."</p>
<p>Big Piggy Bank is lauded as the company's biggest launch for this year so far. The new slot game leverages vibrant colors and includes symbols of gold, cash, pigs and gems. The fun-filled 5x3 reel slot game offers 10 paylines and incorporates an engaging cash collection mechanic.</p>
<p>In addition to the base wins of the game, players who land the Collector symbol on the fifth reel can scoop up all cash values that can be seen. On the other hand, players who land four or more piggy bank and Bonus symbols can activate the thrilling Golden Bank Free Spins Bonus. Big Piggy Bank is a slot with medium volatility and offers a return to player rate (RTP) of 94.5%.</p>
<p>As noted, Bullion Bars Gold Collector is a classic gold-themed slot. It offers a 5x3 layout with 10 paylines and brings engaging options. Players who land gold bullion bar symbols while playing the game can benefit from line wins. This is because those symbols act as mixed pay, granting a chance for big payouts. If players land three or more scatter symbols during the base game, they enter a special Gold Collector Free Spins Bonus, where they can scoop up big prizes.</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment's gold-themed game offers an RTP of 95.05%. Moreover, the slot has a 92% RTP version and brings the developer's popular Gamble Wheel feature that grants a chance for significant payouts.</p>
