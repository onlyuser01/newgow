<p>WynnBET, an online sportsbook and casino operator, has teamed up with SportsGrid, a provider of live sports news coverage, odds and commentary. The two parties will work to boost the In-Game Live All Access Saturday edition.</p>
<p>WynnBET to Power In-Game Live All Access Saturday Edition</p>
<p>In-Game Live is SportsGrid’s panel where sports fans can gain insights on sports betting and learn more about the competitive sports scene. As per the deal with SportsGrid, WynnBET will provide the panel with additional sports betting coverage. The operator’s sponsorship will focus on collegiate leagues, including the NBA, MLB and NHL. WynnBET will notably cover major events including FIFA World Cup, World Series and college football.</p>
<p>WynnBET will also provide In-Game Live All Access with expert insights from the operator’s experienced trading team. The operator will also boost the panel with reviews of upcoming sports games. This will include moneylines and odds, helping sports betting enthusiasts make the most out of their wagers. Lastly, WynnBET will power In-Game Live with consumer promotions, helping the panel engage its viewers even more.</p>
<p>SportsGrid Trusts WynnBET’s Expertise</p>
<p>Jordan Bayroff, vice president of business development and marketing at SportsGrid, said he is very happy to sign the deal. He welcomed WynnBET as a sponsor of the network’s live weekend coverage of games and events.</p>
<p>Bayroff also praised WynnBET’s traders for always being consistently insightful and helping fans with their bets. He believes that the addition of WynnBET’s expert trading team will greatly contribute to the fan experience.</p>
<p>WynnBET’s traders have demonstrated a record of providing insightful perspective and reporting across WynnBET’s platforms. The opportunity to integrate the WynnBET trading team of experts as contributors during the In-Game Live All Access weekend coverage enhances the viewer experience providing informative, insightful and real-time perspective.

<p>Fans can find the WynnBET In-Game Live All Access sponsorship on the Sports Grid Network. The two parties will also promote their collaborative content on their respective social media platforms.</p>
<p>WynnBET has long had a significant presence in professional sports. In early 2022, the operator teamed up with the Jackpocket Lottery app right before the start of the Super Bowl LVI. The two parties agreed to work together and gain more exposure for their respective brands ahead of the football event.</p>
<p>WynnBET recently joined forces with Livespins, an iGaming company that is bullish on expanding in the US market. Livespins was delighted to score that deal as it considers WynnBET to be one of the key players in American gambling.</p>
