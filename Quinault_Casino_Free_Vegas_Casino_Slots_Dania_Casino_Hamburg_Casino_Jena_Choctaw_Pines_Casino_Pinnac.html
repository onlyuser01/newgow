<p>Pinnacle, a sports betting operator, has teamed up with Gamban to give customers access to gambling-block software, which blocks all gambling sites and apps on the customers’ devices.</p>
<p>Pinnacle’s Customers with Access to Self-Blocking Software</p>
<p>Pinnacle, a sports wagering operator, has teamed up with Gamban to provide its customers access to a gambling-block software, allowing them to block themselves from gambling sites and apps on the customers’ devices.</p>
<p>The integration is part of the operator’s commitment to player welfare. Under the agreement, Pinnacle will provide free-of-charge protection to users who want to self-block from gambling sites. Gamban’s software will also block them from thousands of other gambling apps and sites through its constant database update.</p>
<p>When players sign up for the self-block service by Gamban, they can set up the software, which is intuitively designed, and hard to remove on different devices. It provides the right balance between intrusion and protection.</p>
<p>Pinnacle Head of Legal and Compliance, Veronique Dos Reis, stated that player welfare and reasonable gambling are industry issues worldwide. She said that the company is pleased to cooperate with Gamban and offer its clients “a blanket self-exclusion tool,” covering all gambling sites, not just Pinnacle’s.</p>
<p>In recent years Pinnacle has researched different options to provide a responsible gambling service to its customers and effectively deal with harmful behavior. With its collaboration with Gamban, the company fulfills its mission to provide “a safe haven” for all types of gamblers.</p>
<p>Gamban co-founder Jack Symons stated that digital activity today provides instant gratification, which is very tempting. It is Gamban’s mission to provide a tool to users to gain control and balance over that digital activity. He said that Pinnacle commits to its customers, offering them valuable support.</p>
<p>Reis stated that at-risk gamblers must have access to simple tools to protect themselves. According to her, Gamban provides this tool. Pinnacle is sure that this free service will be a vital part of the company’s safe gaming arsenal.</p>
<p>Gamban Business Intelligence Officer James Forman stated that the team anticipates working with Pinnacle. Its goal is to assist more people who are looking for ways to self-exclude from gambling altogether. The company’s mission is to make this process as simple, effective, and easy to use as possible. This collaboration drives the Gamban closer to achieving this goal.</p>
<p>FanDuel Partnered up with Gamban</p>
<p>Last Month, FanDuel inked a partnership with Gamban intending to promote responsible gambling and player protection. The company, which is a part of Flutter Entertainment, will also offer Gamban’s services free of charge and allow players who wish to self-exclude from its real-money gaming site to do so. FanDuel customers can subscribe to Gamban services for free and exclude themselves on up to 15 different personal devices from accessing thousands of gambling websites.</p>
