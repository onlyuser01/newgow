    <h1>Chukchansi Gold Casino Hotels Near Cache Creek Casino Connecticut Casinos Hollywood Casino Amphithea</h1>

<p>This morning when registering at this casino on the last page there was the possibility to accept or decline the welcome bonus by setting the flag or not. I did not select the option and therefore refused the welcome bonus knowing that it was binding with the wagering requirements in order to withdraw any winnings obtained with real money from the deposit made.</p>
<p>Despite this, as soon as I make the first deposit of € 240, I see € 480 credited to my account, half of which is a welcome bonus. Before playing I try to contact the live chat to ask for an explanation on the fact that I was credited with this unwanted bonus because it is binding on the withdrawal of any winnings. In the four attempts I tried to speak to a chat operator, no one showed up after a 20 minute wait. Chat is the only way to contact this casino because it has no customer support email address (which is absurd). So I decide to start playing live roulette (Lightning roulette) hoping that this bonus is not that bonus trap that some casinos use to not let you withdraw until you meet the wagering requirements, which is why I had refused it during registration. During the roulette session I win € 270 after about half an hour of playing using REAL money ONLY. I decide to settle and go out in order to collect the winnings and I find myself unable because the bonus that was activated without my will had not yet met the crazy wagering requirements (I would have had to play another 8000 euros around !!). In that very altered moment I try to contact the live chat again in vain where no one answers. So I decide to continue playing roulette and naturally after a while I lose all my money.</p>
<p>I therefore ask the casino for a full refund of the 240 euros deposited and the approximately 270 euros of winnings obtained initially that I would have liked to cash in for a total of 510 €.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for the help you give me.</p>
