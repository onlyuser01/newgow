<p>As announced by the two companies, the deal will see them work on creating new activations featuring NFL stars and exciting fan experiences for NFL fans.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts and the NFLPA Will Host Special Events</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new multi-year partnership, the leading casino and hospitality company will work with the NFLPA on various fan and player-oriented events. Some of those will feature famous National Football League players or retired legends, boosting fan engagement. In addition, the deal will provide various benefits to NFL players, generating extra value for the NFLPA.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, NFL players will be able to participate in a variety of exciting events. These events are all planned to take place at MGM Resorts’ properties, bolstering the relationship between the operator and the NFLPA.</p>
<p>MGM Rewards subscribers, on the other hand, will have many opportunities to engage with their favorite football stars throughout the football season. The announcement promised extra activations around this year’s NFL Pro Bowl Games and Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas as well as the NFL Draft in Detroit next year.</p>
<p>The announcement also noted that the new agreement will provide NFL players and NFL alumni with many opportunities to pen ambassador deal with MGM Resorts. The operator’s ambassadors will be expected to promote the brand through various activations, media appearances and online presence.</p>
<p>Providing World-Class Entertainment to Fans and Friends</p>
<p>Gina Scott, vice president of partner services at the NFLPA, commented on the agreement. She praised the deal, saying that it will allow NFL stars to be at the forefront of exciting activations alongside MGM Resorts. Scott said that her company is very happy about the opportunities this deal will provide to players and fans.</p>
<p>DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFLPA, also shared his thoughts and called MGM Resorts an “ideal partner” for the association. Smith lauded the operator as a leading hospitality company and said that the agreement will entertain fans and NFL players alike.</p>
<p>For us, we love the game of football but we also know that a part of this is providing world-class entertainment to our fans and to our friends. And for all those reasons there is probably no better partner in the world than MGM. DeMaurice Smith, exec director, NFLPA</p>
<p>Lance Evans, MGM Resorts’ senior vice president of sports and sponsorships, noted that this latest deal is “another indication” of the operator’s strong commitment to sports and football in particular.</p>
<p>As football’s premier events come to Las Vegas, we look forward to welcoming players and creating world-class experiences for MGM Rewards members. Lance Evans, SVP of sports and sponsorships, MGM Resorts</p>
