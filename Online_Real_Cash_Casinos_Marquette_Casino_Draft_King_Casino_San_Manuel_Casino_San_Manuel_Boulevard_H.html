<p>OpenBet, the sports betting engine that powers the biggest sportsbooks in the US and worldwide, unveiled its technology and trading offering for the upcoming Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Anticipating Unprecedented Levels of Betting</p>
<p>Last year, OpenBet registered zero downtime during the Big Game and the tech solution is intent on keeping that unchanged while facing a significantly expanded market in the US. In 2021, 20 states had legal wagering on sports by the time of the Super Bowl but now this number has expanded to 30, the latest being New York.</p>
<p>This time around, there is one more variable to consider while preparing for unprecedented levels of transactions across its portfolio during the main sporting event and that is gaming content from the acquired in May SportCast.</p>
<p>Proud to be “at the heart of facilitating entertaining and responsible betting experiences for players,” OpenBet chief product officer Nikos Konstakis reminded all who utilize the sports betting solution they “can depend” on the engine to live to its fame during the biggest occasion and deliver “unrivaled experience and robustness.”</p>
<p>“With an elevated content and trading offering, we’re anticipating our busiest sporting events ever and our teams and technology are ready for kick-off.” Nikos Konstakis, Chief Product Officer, OpenBet</p>
<p>In anticipation of the Big Game, SportCast developed a range of American football BetBilder offerings unseen to date, presenting sports bettors with over 1400 different types of market selections to choose from to affirm its leading position in same-game parlays worldwide. BetBuilder offering will be live with more than 40 operators and in 40 different languages during the most important annual event in US football.</p>
<p>Match Operators’ and Bettors’ Expectations</p>
<p>SportCast’s vice president of content and managing director Ryan Coombs also confirmed the expectation for unprecedented levels of betting activity as the Big Game comes “at a time when the burgeoning US sports betting market shows no signs of slowing” and the popularity of American football continues to grow worldwide.</p>
<p>“As we have experienced over the previous 12 months, BetBuilder is in very strong demand and we’ve responded to develop a comprehensive offering for the Big Game. With exciting new markets to experience, we’re confident that our enhanced product will match the expectations of operators and bettors worldwide.” Ryan Coombs, VP Content and Managing Director, SportCast</p>
<p>BetBuilder, powered by SportCast’s data collection, features six different Quarterback markets, offering bettors a chance to wager on the Yards, Touchdowns, Passes, Interceptions, Attempts, and Completions in the Big Game in one of the most advanced and compelling offerings in its history.</p>
<p>Regardless of the overall scoreline, bettors will also be offered numerous team prop markets throughout the game, such as Team sacks, Fumbles lost, and Next team to score a safety.</p>
