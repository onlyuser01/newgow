<p>Play’n GO has confirmed receiving the Safer Gambling Gold** Award, proving its commitment to safe player experiences</p>
<p>The 2005-launched provider of casino entertainment solutions that offers its titles to regulated operators in more than 25 jurisdictions has confirmed receiving the prestigious award that proves the success and dedication of its current safer gambling standards.</p>
<p>Play’n GO: “Player Safety Comes First in Everything We Do”</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive officer and co-founder Johan Törnqvist spoke about their ongoing commitment and interest in always putting safety first “in everything we do,” while showing the way to a safer and more sustainable future.</p>
<p>The CEO also called their scoring of the Safer Gambling Standard Gold** Award “a great milestone” on their current journey in the industry, describing it as a result of the hard work put into their products and player experiences that commonly goes unobserved.</p>
<p>Törnqvist added that he was “enormously proud” of all the Play’n GO staff while calling their commitment to player safety an “essential” part of the gambling industry’s bright future.</p>
<p>To conclude his message conveyed in the light of receiving the prestigious award, Törnqvist took the opportunity to encourage the rest of the providers and operators in the industry to keep striving to provide safe gambling experiences primarily focused on entertainment.</p>
<p>The Sweden-based supplier of premium slots announced that it would introduce its highly-acclaimed games to Connecticut at the end of February, this way marking its presence in the fourth US state.</p>
<p>What Does the Gold** Award Represent for the Industry?</p>
<p>The well-known supplier of advice, support, and information for people affected by gambling harms GamCare officially runs the Safer Gambling Standard.</p>
<p>The standard represents a widely-recognized standard in the industry and it is an independent quality standard that evaluates and determines the safe gambling policies and measures implemented by businesses in the industry in order to keep players protected against the common harms related to gambling.</p>
<p>The award is only handed to those gambling companies that are currently working on developing their safer gambling policies or to companies that have already embraced a series of top-tier measures going “beyond the social responsibility provisions of their gambling license”.</p>
<p>The new award scooped up by Play’n GO, therefore, comes to prove its constant commitment to offering the safest player experiences.</p>
<p>The news comes just after the supplier secured an operating license in Spain at the start of May. At the end of March, Play’n GO also scored a brand new Swedish supplier license. Both of these licenses will help the company strengthen its European foothold while building upon its current momentum.</p>
