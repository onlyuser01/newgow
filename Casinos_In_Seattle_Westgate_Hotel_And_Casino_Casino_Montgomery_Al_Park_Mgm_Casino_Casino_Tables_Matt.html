    <h1>Casinos In Seattle Westgate Hotel And Casino Casino Montgomery Al Park Mgm Casino Casino Tables Matt</h1>

<p>70-year-old mattress store owner Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale feels more alive and kicking than ever. His latest $2 million wager on the Patriots to win the Super Bowl in February of 2022 is yet further proof of his thirst for adrenaline-pumping betting experiences.</p>
<p>Mattress Mack placed two incredible wagers for a grand total of $2 million on the New England Patriots to win the Super Bowl. The wagers were made last Thursday, the day when the Pats managed to defeat Atlanta and continue their winning streak on their fifth straight game.</p>
<p>theScore Bet and Barstool Sportsbook Took Wagers</p>
<p>The bets were placed with theScore Bet, which took a smaller $750,000 wager, and Barstool Sportsbook, where Mack placed a $1.25 million bet. The sportsbooks are officially owned by Penn National Gaming, and they both had the Patriots at +2300 odds. Now, it’s all up to Bill Belichick and his team to win the seventh Super Bowl and bring Mack a mind-boggling 8-figure return, on top of the $2 million that he wagered. He could win a staggering $46 million, which would be one of the biggest payouts in the history of sports betting in the US.</p>
<p>Mattress Mack Loves to Take Big Risks</p>
<p>This isn’t the Houston’s businessman first mind-blowing wager to make it into the news. Mattress Mack has rapidly turned into a genuine sports betting celeb recognized nationwide when he started placing huge wagers on the Houston Astros to win the World Series in 2020. Proving his incredible genius when it comes to business and advertising, Mack took advantage of his newsworthy wagers to cover his Gallery Furniture promotions.</p>
<p>The promotions would offer customers purchasing luxury mattresses worth at least $3,000 a 100% price discount. The discounts would only be given in case the Astros managed to win the World Series. However, this was not the case. That didn’t stop Mattress Mack from continuing his spectacular wagers. Accordingly, he decided to run this promotion once again in 2021, as his hometown team returned to the World Series. He wagered $2 million on the Astros in June, with +1000 odds.</p>
<p>Mattress Mack also wagered $100,000 with +1600 odds on Houston with theScore Bet in Colorado. While the team made it to the World Series, they eventually lost to Atlanta.</p>
<p>A Sports Betting Icon</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in February, Mattress Mack made a $3.5 million bet on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Mattress Mack wagered the team would cover the 3.5-point spread during the Super Bowl LV. The team won and Mack suddenly added $2.7 million to his bank account.</p>
<p>Mack also has a passion for horse betting and used to own Belmont Stakes winner Runhappy. In May 2021, he bet $2.4 million on favorite Essential Quality during the Kentucky Derby. His bet was once again connected to one of his irresistible Gallery promotions. Unfortunately, the horse finished fourth. Even Mattress Mack can’t win them all, but this sure doesn’t seem to stop him from having a ball. Just last month, he was invited to throw out the first pitch at the Astros vs Chicago White Sox game as part of the American League Division Series.</p>
