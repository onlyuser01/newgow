<p>Genius Sports is delighted that the NBA continues to see the benefits of reliable data and trusts the upcoming Dragon platform</p>
<p>Sports data and tech company Genius Sports has, through its Second Spectrum subsidiary, extended its partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA). Under the multi-year deal expansion, Second Spectrum will be named as the official NBA league pass augmentation provider. The deal will also see the brand as the association’s official basketball analytics provider.</p>
<p>As agreed by the entities involved, Second Spectrum will work with the NBA on researching and developing a next-gen tech platform called Dragon. The latter solution will track “mesh” data, helping the NBA synthesize million of on-court basketball data points.</p>

<p>The official announcement reads that the NBA will use Second Spectrum’s augmentation tech to develop automated and enhanced graphics based on optical on-court basketball data. The data will power alternate telecasts appearing on NBA League Pass. As a result, the telecasts will be able to include reliable team and player statistical insights incorporated right into the stream.</p>
<p>By leveraging these enhanced data, the NBA will be able to greatly improve viewers’ experience. Fervent sports fans and bettors who desire detailed analytics will be able to further immerse themselves in the game.</p>
<p>In addition, Genius Sports announced that all official NBA tracking data will continue to be integrated into its top-notch basketball insight and analytics engine. In return, the sports data specialist will continue to provide its services to all 30 NBA teams. All franchises currently rely on Second Spectrum’s cutting-edge machine learning to better understand the game and make important decisions.</p>
