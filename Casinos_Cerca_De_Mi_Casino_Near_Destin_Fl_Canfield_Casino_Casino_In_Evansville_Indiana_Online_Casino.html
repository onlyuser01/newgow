<p>Players in BetMGM’s New Jersey market now have access to unique content provided by Scientific Games’ Open Gaming platform, as part of an extension of the existing relationship between the companies.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Boosts BetMGM’s iGaming Portfolio with OpenGaming</p>
<p>BetMGM and Scientific Games Corporation have entered into a fresh agreement, expanding on their existing partnership to boost BetMGM’s online casino portfolio. Scientific Games is looking to scale up its iGaming presence in the United States by helping a trusted partner cement its position in the vertical.</p>
<p>BetMGM will receive access to SG’s dedicated gamification and player management tools, allowing the company to improve on the existing iGaming experience. SG is spearheading this important milestone with the help of its native OpenGaming platform, a powerful aggregator of content that the company believes will fit with BetMGM’s own strategy.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, SG SVP of Gaming &amp; Digital, Dylan Slaney, has noted that the decision to expand on the existing relationship was a result of the successful relationship between the companies so far.</p>
<p>It was similarly a hallmark to the importance and potential of the United States’ iGaming market, Slaney added. BetMGM will gain access to the OpenGaming product software, which features the Open Gaming System (OGS).</p>
<p>Boosting the Content Offering</p>
<p>Thanks to OGS, Scientific Games is able to aggregate content from established vendors across the entire industry and offer an equalizing cutting-edge experience.</p>
<p>BetMGM will receive access to a number of player-favorite games, including but not limited to jackpot offers, free spins, and various tools designed to improve retention and engagement.</p>
<p>OGS is already available on BetMGM’s operations in New Jersey, serving as a precursor of further expansion in Pennsylvania and from there on in, across the entire United States. Thanks to OGS and BetMGM’s expanding clout, many casino vendors and developers will be able to gain quick access to the US market.</p>
<p>Responding to these events, BetMGM Vice President Gaming Matthew Sunderland has hailed Scientific Games expertise in developing great casino management tools and products that bring value to the player.</p>
<p>“This builds on a well-established partnership, and Scientific Games will continue to be a key iGaming partner for us as we extend our operational reach in the coming years,” Sunderland had to add.</p>
<p>Previously, BetMGM signed an iGaming partnership with Playtech once again in New Jersey. The company also rolled out NetEnt products in West Virginia.</p>
