<p>Ways of Fortune review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Ways of Fortune is set in feudal China, where you play as a brave warrior on his lonely steed riding out to seek wealth and adventure in the jewel encrusted landscape around him.</p>
<p>The background is a fantastical rendering of the Chinese countryside and the symbols are the swords and dragons of adventure as well as the jewels which come as the reward for those adventures.</p>
<p>Easy to get a 5 of a kind win in Ways of Fortune slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Ways of Fortune is a lovely looking slot made by Habanero. The backdrop is painted with talent and has a tone that fits perfectly with the swashbuckling imagery of the reels.</p>
<p>The reels are well animated, cleanly and simply without any extra fuss or showiness.</p>
<p>The whole thing is capped by a gentle background music track and excellent sound design for the various win noises, reel noises and bonus symbols hitting.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Ways of Fortune has an interesting twist on the typical five by three slot format.</p>
<p>At the top of reels three through five there is an extra symbol. In the base game, this extra space is always occupied by three identical randomly selected symbols.</p>
<p>Ways of Fortune is an any way wins slot machine, meaning that any line of symbols appearing in consecutive reels can pay out, as long as they start with the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>Reels 3 to 5 have one extra symbol each</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except for the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbols do not pay out. Instead, they trigger the Bonus when three or more of them land anywhere on the reels. You win ten free spins for three Scatter symbols, fifteen for four symbols, and twenty for five.</p>
<p>During free games, you can win with any ways combinations that start either in the leftmost reel or the rightmost.</p>
<p>Fantastic visuals for a base game big win</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 98.12%, a fabulous number that is well above average. It is let down somewhat by the fact that the volatility of Ways of Fortune is low. As a result, this game does not fit very well with the kind of strategies we prefer.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.28 up to a maximum of $/£/€140.00 per spin.</p>
<p>High symbols paytable in Ways of Fortune slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Ways of Fortune creates a beautiful world of endless fun almost effortlessly. Unfortunately, that fun dies off rather quickly when you realise how repetitive the game is. With only the most basic of features there is little to keep you interested.</p>
<p>Coupled with its low volatility this game does not get a recommendation from us.</p>
<p>However, for someone who likes their games simple and low-variance, this is has a pretty attractive RTP.</p>
