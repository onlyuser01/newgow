<p>The final game of the 2024 NFL Divisional Round is arguably the most exciting one. In the AFC Divisional game, last year‚Äôs Super Bowl winners, the Kansas City Chiefs will lock horns with the Buffalo Bills at Highmark Stadium at Orchard Park on Sunday evening</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills AFC Divisional game is going to be the first time this season that the defending champions aren‚Äôt seen as betting favorites. The Chiefs are coming to Orchard Park as 2.5-point underdogs.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre wondering what‚Äôs the reason for this, there are several, starting with the fact that the Bills have been tremendous at home. However, one should keep in mind that the Chiefs won each of their last three games with the Bills on the road.</p>

<p>The Chiefs are Coming to NY State for a Win</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are the defending NFL champions, who finished the regular season with an 11-6 record. They did win the AFC West, but it was their worst record since 2017, which was Patrick Mahomes‚Äôs rookie season.</p>
<p>The 2023 regular season wasn‚Äôt his best campaign, but we did see Mahomes improve some areas of his game. For instance, even though he made just 4,183 passing yards ‚Äì his worst number since 2019 ‚Äì he did improve his precision, recording a 67.2 completion percentage.</p>
<p>10 minutes of Patrick Mahomes play extension highlights üî•üíØ‚ù§Ô∏èpic.twitter.com/vb4YSFEYoz ‚Äî NGB (@TheGoatMahomes) January 12, 2024</p>
<p>His completion percentage wasn‚Äôt great in the first game of the postseason. Mahomes went 23-for-41 (56.1% completion), but he did throw for one touchdown and no interceptions. That was enough for his team to beat the Miami Dolphins 26-7 on a very cold night at Arrowhead.</p>
<p>Now, Mahomes and the Chiefs are coming to New York State, where they‚Äôve got some really nice memories. In fact, they won each of their last three duels with the Bills at Highmark Stadium. This includes the one played in 2020 which was the first time Mahomes played against Buffalo. The final score in that game was 26-17 for the visitors. Can they do something similar again?</p>
<p>Is It Time for the Bills to Take That Big Leap Forward?</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills have never won the Super Bowl, but they came very close on several occasions. Their fans sure hope that can change in 2024.</p>
<p>The Bills have had a fantastic roster for a while now, the evidence being that they‚Äôve reached the postseason in each of their last four seasons. With Sean McDermott as their coach, they reached the AFC Divisional Round on three occasions in the past, and they even reached the AFC Championship once only to lose to the Chiefs.</p>
<p>In their 2024 Playoff duel, they‚Äôre seen as betting favorites. The reason isn‚Äôt just that the Chiefs haven‚Äôt been too impressive this season; it‚Äôs also because the Bills have been playing great football, especially at home.</p>
<p>They went 11-6 in the regular season, winning the AFC East along the way. What‚Äôs interesting is that their home record was 7-2. Then, in the Wild Card Round, they destroyed the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-17 at home.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills Prediction</p>
<p>It‚Äôs all about Patrick Mahomes. This guy goes into a killer mode in the playoffs, putting on his best performances when under pressure. At least, that was the case in the past. In his first playoff game of 2024, he didn‚Äôt impress much against the Dolphins. And now, he‚Äôs supposed to play against the NFL‚Äôs 4th-best defense. Will he throw for more than one TD?</p>
<p>We think he might, but we‚Äôre not sure that‚Äôs going to be enough for his team. The Bills are hungry for success, and we think they‚Äôre gonna go all-in on Sunday to grab a win.</p>
<p>Pick: Buffalo Bills</p>
