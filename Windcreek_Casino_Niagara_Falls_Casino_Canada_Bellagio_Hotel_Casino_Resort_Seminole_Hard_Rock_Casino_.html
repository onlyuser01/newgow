    <h1>Windcreek Casino Niagara Falls Casino Canada Bellagio Hotel Casino Resort Seminole Hard Rock Casino</h1>

<p>Aga Kamont will be Entain’s new head of operations. The former BetVictor safer gambling expert announced her new appointment via her official LinkedIn profile. With over a decade and a half of industry experience across several high-profile operators, she joins Entain at an opportune moment as the company continues its worldwide expansion.</p>
<p>Kamont Has Substantial Experience in the Gambling Industry</p>
<p>The new Entain head of operation has spent her entire career in the gambling industry. Her professional journey had a humble beginning. She started out as a croupier at Crown London Aspinalls, an exclusive private members club located in the heart of London. Over the next three years, she worked at several more land-based establishments, eventually rising to senior inspector at The Clermont Club. In 2013, she took a short break from the gambling industry to work as a senior interior designer before resuming her climb in the betting world.</p>
<p>Kamont’s big break came in 2016 when she started work as a gaming operations executive at William Hill’s Gibraltar office. During her 18 months with the operator, she accrued valuable leadership experience and familiarized herself with the intricacies of the online gambling industry. The knowledge served her well, as she moved to UK operator The Rank Group in 2017 to become the company’s new product manager. Some of Kamont’s highlights during that time include delivering a 20% year-to-year increase in revenue and an award for Best Mobile Product in 2018.</p>
<p>In 2020, Kamont started work for leading bookmaker BetVictor as a technical compliance manager. Her solid experience and motivation quickly propelled her up the ranks, and within two years, she had risen to head of safer gambling applied research before moving to Entain.</p>
<p>Entain Will Utilize Her Talents to Aid Global Expansion</p>
<p>In her LinkedIn post, Kamont expressed gratitude to the BetVictor team, lauding the positive atmosphere and the growth opportunities.</p>
<p>“BV has the best C-suite I have met, and I will be thankful forever for the support I received.” Aga Kamont, head of operation at Entain</p>
<p>Kamont is joining Entain at an opportune time for the company. According to the operator’s H1 results, gross profits increased by 17% to $1.61 billion. The extra funds will be instrumental in fueling international expansion, as the company recently announced the creation of a branch focused on Central and Eastern Europe – a largely untapped market. A slew of new acquisitions opened new opportunities in Croatia, Latvia, Poland, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>At Entain, Kamont will have ample opportunity to utilize her vast experience. With positions across leading operators and knowledge of almost every aspect of the gambling industry, she will be a valuable addition to Entain’s management team as the company expands its global reach.</p>
