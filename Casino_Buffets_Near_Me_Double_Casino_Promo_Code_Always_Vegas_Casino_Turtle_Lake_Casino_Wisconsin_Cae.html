    <h1>Casino Buffets Near Me Double Casino Promo Code Always Vegas Casino Turtle Lake Casino Wisconsin Cae</h1>

<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>With reference to this case, we have repeatedly reviewed the situation which became a cause for the complaint of Mr. Tomas.</p>
<p>We have to inform you and the player that following further review of the said complaint we came again to the same conclusion that certain actions of Tomas and the results of his bets give us a reason to suspect that the mentioned player acted in bad faith, details of which may be provided to your agent privately due to certain non-disclosure restrictions from our soft provider.</p>
<p>We draw your attention to the fact that this sort of decision refusing the payments of prizes with further blocking of the player’s account is being accepted by us only in case of serious warnings from the appropriate soft provider received by us in case of breaches or suspicious events identified and fixed by means of technological security solutions, evidencing the possible attempted fraud.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, our soft provider has been providing us with risk and fraud management solutions as part of our agreement and we trust them completely as well as their software which detects the major arbitrage issues.</p>
<p>Given the above, our initial decision to refuse the payment of the prize to the mentioned above player and further blocking of his account remains in full force for the time being.</p>
<p>Allow me also at this stage to recall that the above-mentioned decision is fully in accordance with the Sports Betting Rules according to which we reserve the right to block the opportunity of the client’s account to place bets, cancel all bets, or address to law enforcement bodies in the case when the client is suspected in fraud.</p>
<p>We are highly interested in every one player but we are strongly against any kind of fraud which will be always preventing such cases solely within the framework of Law and our Rules.</p>
<p>We are currently preparing all the required materials on this case and studying the possibility of approaching the enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>Please, also note that the mentioned above player is entitled to appeal our decision in court and we would be happy to provide the court with the supporting inputs and detailed analysis of the soft provider evidencing the attempted fraud and our right to refuse the payment.</p>
