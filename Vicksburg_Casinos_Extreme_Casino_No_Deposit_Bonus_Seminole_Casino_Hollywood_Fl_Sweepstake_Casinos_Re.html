<p>The primary advocacy voice for Nevada’s gaming and resort industry, the Nevada Resort Association (NRA), announced on Monday the foundation of a new non-partisan state-level political action committee (PAC).</p>
<p>New PAC Founded by the NRA Raises $2 Million</p>
<p>The goal of the new PAC will be to help support business-minded candidates who are aware of how important the gaming and resort industry is for Nevada. According to the NRA, so far, the new PAC has raised some $2 million from different members of the Association. The money is expected to be used for assessing, recruiting, and electing state legislative candidates during 2022.</p>
<p>Additionally, the NRA explained that the new PAC is “committed to participating in Nevada’s electoral and political process and will present a strong, unified voice on policies affecting the gaming and resort industry and its employees.” The process itself will start by analyzing and evaluating the candidates. Moreover, the PAC will determine if they follow the priorities of the industry.</p>
<p>By using voting records, as well as an extensive candidate questionnaire, the PAC will select suitable candidates. Consequently, the PAC will “make endorsements and contributions.” Currently, such candidates cannot receive more than $10,000 in contributions from a single entity, but this rule does not apply to PACs. Besides endorsements, NRA’s PAC also plans to boost the industry’s priorities via community outreach, as well as targeted educational programs.</p>
<p>The Gaming and Resort Industry Is Incredibly Important</p>
<p>The NRA’s president, Virginia Valentine, outlined that the gaming and resort industry contributes by more than one-third of the state’s general fund. She explained that this makes it the largest taxpayer in Nevada. Moreover, Valentine stressed that the industry supports more than 433,000 jobs in the state but also helps small businesses.</p>
<p>“Nevada’s gaming and resort industry is the lifeblood of our state’s economy, supporting more than 433,000 jobs, thousands of small businesses, and contributing more than a third of the state’s general fund as the state’s largest taxpayer.” Virginia Valentine, president of the Nevada Resort Association</p>
<p>Acknowledging the devastating impact of the pandemic on the gaming and resort industry, NRA’s president pointed out that Nevada’s prosperity is related to the industry. According to her, selecting candidates that are aware of the importance of the industry is critical and will play a key role in the state’s recovery.</p>
<p>“With an initial $2 million in funding, our PAC is well-positioned to make early investments in key races to elect common-sense, responsible candidates focused on economic issues and who will serve Nevada well.” Virginia Valentine, president of the Nevada Resort Association</p>
<p>Valentine added that the NRA is looking for “sensible individuals” that will help the growth of the state’s economy and encourage investment and job creation. This, according to her, will help Nevada keep its position as a “global leader in travel and tourism.”</p>
