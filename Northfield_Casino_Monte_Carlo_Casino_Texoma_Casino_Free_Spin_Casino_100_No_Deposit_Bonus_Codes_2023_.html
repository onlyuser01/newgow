    <h1>Northfield Casino Monte Carlo Casino Texoma Casino Free Spin Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023</h1>

<p>Dear casino guru team,</p>
<p>I just played at cadabrus casino on 20.06. and lost 100€.</p>
<p>After this I noticed that the casinos licence number is "MGA/B2C/486/2018" . In the same licence is the casino betinia and light casino and more. My accounts are closed on these sites and not able to be reopened (from these sister site casinos in the same license - the support information) on this sites. I got told I closed my account a while ago permanently. My reason was gambling issues, because I am gambling addicted and blocked me everywhere. So the support told me I will not be able to play at any casino within this licence again. Not able to play at any sister project.</p>
<p>But as I wrote I was able to do it on cadabrus, even if I closed my accounts on other brand in the named license before for gambling issues permanent. The casinos support confirmed this to me. I got Screenshots from this messages.</p>
<p>That I was able to play at cadabrus casino site also violates the "MGA Directive 2 of 2018 - Player Protection Directive - Part IV – Responsible Gaming (4)":</p>
<p>"[...] Provided further that, in the event that a player has been excluded by the B2C licensee in light of sufficient reasons which indicate that the player may have problem gambling issues, that player shall be excluded across all brands operated by the B2C licensee. [...]. "</p>
<p>That did not happen at the cadabrus brand casino.</p>
<p>So I kindly asked cadabrus to refund my today's deposit of 100€ to my bank account, which the deposit came from, because they did not protected me as a player, even the license was aware of my issues. That was against the MGA player protection directive.</p>
<p>I wrote this to them, they closed my account now permanent but ignored the refund claim.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
