<p>JLo’s 130th show at the Caesars Entertainment resort sold $1.43 million in tickets, a mark the casino company says is a record for a single-night Las Vegas residency show. Britney Spears held the previous high at $1.17 million for her finale, which occurred in the very same theater when it was known as the Axis.</p>
<p>Saturday’s ticket sales record isn’t Lopez’s only milestone achieved in Las Vegas. She’s additionally the fastest performer on the Strip to sell $100 million worth of tickets.</p>
<p>Celebrities filled the Zappos to witness firsthand JLo’s residency curtain call. Among the stars were her boyfriend Alex Rodriguez, Diddy, LL Cool J, and Ja Rule.</p>
<p>Star Attractions</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Visitors and Convention Authority (LVCVA) reveals in its 2017 Visitor Profile that nearly six in ten travelers attend shows during their stays, and more than 20 percent pay to see a big-name headliner such as JLo.</p>
<p>Tickets for Lopez’s residency ranged from $60 to over $1,000 for a VIP experience. With Zappos holding 4,600 seats, the $1 million nightly mark was eclipsed several times. For her showmanship, JLo is paid $350,000 per night.</p>
<p>Caesars will have another big-name star to fill when Celine Dion exists the stage in June. The Las Vegas mainstay has been packing theaters for 13 of the last 16 years, but announced last month that her residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace will conclude on June 8.</p>
<p>There are plenty of rumors circulating that JLo will be back to Las Vegas, but employed by MGM Resorts and its new Park MGM venue. The former Monte Carlo was transformed into two properties with a $550 million renovation, and opened as Park MGM and the NoMad in May.</p>
<p>Caesars ‘Entertainment’</p>
<p>Las Vegas is today known for its A-list entertainment as much as its gambling.</p>
<p>In a statement highlighting Lopez’s final show, Caesars declared that’s it’s “known for revitalizing the modern era of entertainment in Las Vegas with its record-breaking headlining residencies. The company has consistently been at the forefront of entertainment and has set a high standard for Las Vegas, forcing others in the industry to follow.”</p>
<p>The casino operator’s newest act in its lineup is Gwen Stefani, whose residency at Zappos kicked off in June.</p>
<p>Caesars is betting on its entertainment experience in trying to woo over Japanese officials who will decide the three casino companies that receive permits to conduct gaming in the country. The general public remains opposed to authorizing commercial casinos.</p>
<p>Caesars President of Entertainment Jason Gastwirth explained recently to Asian Gaming Review, “Our pitch to the market has been that we are entertainment first.”</p>
<p>Caesars is one of several casino operators that have already submitted proposals for an integrated resort in Japan. Former US Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D) is heading up Caesars’ three-person “Japan Advisory Committee.”</p>
