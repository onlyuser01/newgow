<p>Dear Thomas:</p>
<p>Of course I took the selfie (I attach it) and not only that, but I also attached abundant documents that exceeded what they demanded. I made dozens of money transactions that were denied to me, and they put as a pretext some new other documents that I needed. In this message you can see the immensity of documents that I sent them and that complied with what was required. Every time I wanted to withdraw the money (I am also attaching the immense number of times I wanted to withdraw the money, they asked me for a new document, and they rejected my withdrawal, there were really many withdrawals and refusals for any pretext. The last thing was the selfie, which also I provided it, and it was not even validated until now, although I have an email that I sent to 20bet VIP manager Zackary Turborg when cash outs were constantly being rejected, which, as you can see, exceeded his requirements. Every time When I made a withdrawal, they would come up with any excuse to attach a new document. You can see the number of times I requested the withdrawal of my profit from a deposit of 2,300 soles, and it turned out to be impossible because it was clear that the intention was not to pay (I have seen it on several other pages) under the pretext that they always either asked for a new document, or did not approve it on purpose to request a new document. Send all my bank statements, do Identity documents, proof of deposit, selfie, etc. You can see it in the attached files, as well as the email that I sent to Mr. Turborg asking him for assistance since I suspected this modality to avoid withdrawing my money. Mr. Turborg did not answer me that day, but a day later, when they already knew that I had spent the money strategically, and that is where he pointed out that I could withdraw my money. This confirms that this is a modality that borders on fraud, and that prevents the winner of large amounts from accessing their money.</p>
<p>I played in dozens of betting houses, and this has never happened to me in my life.</p>
<p>We have joined a group of Peruvians who have suffered from the same 20bet methodology who were never able to withdraw their money for the same reason, and we are going to the computer crime division, the casino regulator (Ministry of Commerce) and the press.</p>
<p>Nobody deserves something like this to happen to them, even more so that they had invested more than 20 thousand dollars in the page</p>
