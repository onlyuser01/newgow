<p>Join the Steampunk-Inspired Action in Money Train 3</p>
<p>The new game brings back the classic steampunk-inspired action, carrying players through the mesmerizing apocalyptic scenery loyal players of the series are already used to. Sniper, Collector, Collector-Payer, and Necromancer are back again as main characters in Money Train 3, ready to lead the way to big wins in this high-volatility game with a max payout capped at 100,000x the initial bet.</p>
<p>Some of the hottest fresh features the game comes with are the Absorber, ready to soak up all game multipliers and use them to gain more strength, the Persistent Shapeshifter who can change into any feature on any random spin, or the Tommy Gun which is in the possession of the Payer or Sniper. The gun works by targeting a single game symbol type prior to adding more to its original value.</p>
<p>During the base game, players can also enjoy the Respin feature which can be randomly triggered on any spin that is not a winning spin. Once the feature is engaged, one of the symbols on the grid will be randomly picked and turned into a sticky symbol. At the same time, players are granted a respin.</p>
<p>The Money Cart Bonus Is Back</p>
<p>Another classic game feature that has made a return in Money Train 3 is the Money Cart Bonus Round. The feature was incredibly popular among players of the previous game in the series and it is expected to trigger similar results in the new release.</p>
<p>This time around, the bonus round is activated when a player manages to land a minimum of three bonus symbols on any random position on the reels. At the beginning of the round, the symbols used to trigger the round will give layers three free spins, while showcasing a value displayed as a multiplication of the initial bet.</p>
<p>During the base game, players can also enjoy the Respin feature which can be randomly triggered on any spin that is not a winning spin. Once the feature is engaged, one of the symbols on the grid will be randomly picked and turned into a sticky symbol. At the same time, players are granted a respin.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s chief executive officer Simon Hammon spoke about the “resounding success of the Money Train series,” calling the release of the new title “a huge task.” Hammon expressed his delight that the company managed to reach the success of the previous games in the franchise by listening to feedback from both operators and players and creating a game with gameplay.</p>
<p>In August, Relax Gaming announced its aggregated content will be present on the bet365 platform. Towards the end of September, the company made an important move on the LatAm iGaming market via a launch in Colombia.</p>
