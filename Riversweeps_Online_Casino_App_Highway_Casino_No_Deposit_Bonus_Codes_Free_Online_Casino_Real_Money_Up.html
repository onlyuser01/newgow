<p>GamePLAI has received £1.5 million ($1.9 million) from several veterans in the gambling industry to support its 12-month global growth plan</p>
<p>The sportsbook trading supplier that employs machine learning and real-time technology to assess each second of a sporting event to curate rich analytics and forecasts that generate fan engagement, GamePLAI, has scooped up £1.5 million ($1.9 million) in new investment.</p>
<p>The funding comes from a number of gambling industry veterans, including Pinnacle’s former trading director, Marco Blume.</p>
<p>The supplier that provides AI-powered automated trading products for microbetting, player props pricing, and risk management, will be making use of the new financing to strengthen its footprint worldwide.</p>
<p>The money comes in preparation for a summer season packed with important sporting highlights, including the noteworthy Copa America and Euro 2024, the end of the current National Basketball Association, as well as the upcoming renewal of the Major League Baseball season.</p>
<p>GamePLAI will cleverly use the money to hit the acceleration pedal on its development at a “pivotal point” in 2024, further supporting its technology and product roadmap over the course of the upcoming 12 months.</p>
<p>The Launch of a Player Micros Product, Underway</p>
<p>GamePLAI, which already owns a live Micro Markets solution, is also getting ready to launch a player props offering which will also feature a Player Micros product designed for soccer.</p>
<p>The launch will take place right in time for the Copa America and Euro 2024, given the critical role of these tournaments in terms of annual turnover and the acquisition of new accounts.</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive officer, Graham Savage, spoke about their constantly expanding roster of partners that are benefiting from innovative, player-focused markets that have not been seen before, that engage fans both during the game as well as prior to it.</p>
<p>Savage also spoke about their mission to turn into the premium provider of automated and quantitative-driven sports solutions, mentioning that they were very fortunate to enjoy backup from their investors.</p>
<p>GamePLAI also announced it appointed ex-Banach Technology head of corporate development, Donal Barron, as chairman of the leadership team.</p>
<p>Barron spent around three years with the supplier of sports betting technology prior to it being sold to PointsBet in 2021 as a result of a $43 million deal.</p>
<p>In October, PointsBet reported a slight decrease in turnover after the sale of its US assets in its Q1 FY24 report. The same report also signaled a drop in total sports betting handle of 3% year-over-year.</p>
