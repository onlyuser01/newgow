<p>Play’n GO, a company describing itself as “the best gaming entertainment supplier there is,” has secured a license to offer its products in Ontario. The province’s regulated gambling market is set to launch on April 4.</p>
<p>Play’n GO Successfully Secured an AGCO License</p>
<p>Ontario’s upcoming market has been a prime target of numerous betting companies and suppliers. Play’n GO is now one of the brands with official approval by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario and will be able to power operators with its cutting-edge gambling products. The company distributes some of the most highly demanded titles in betting, including Book of Dead, Reactoonz, Rise of Olympus, and Tome of Madness among others.</p>
<p>We have received an Ontario licence to start supplying operators with our industry-leading portfolio of games when the markets open on 4 April 🍁</p>

<p>Play’n GO’ products are sure to find an audience among the bettors in the Canadian province. However, the company will have significant competition as several notable rival companies have also secured licenses and are ready to conquer the new market. A few days ago, the supplier Gaming Realms received AGCO’s approval and is currently preparing for the market launch. Bragg Gaming Group also received a license of its own a day before Gaming Realms did.</p>
<p>The Company Wants to Conquer More Regulated Markets</p>
<p>Magnus Olsson, the chief commercial officer of Play’n GO is excited by the opportunities that wait in Ontario. He noted that the regulated gambling markets are crucial to the development of the gambling sector, lauding their safe gaming environments. Olsson added that this safety helps operators focus on providing unforgettable experiences while remaining sustainable.</p>
<p>Olsson pointed out that Ontario is a key market as it houses 40% of the Canadian population and has huge growth potential. The COO is excited by the opportunity to provide local bettors with Play’n GO’s premium gambling titles.</p>
<p>Ontario isn’t the only North American market that Play’n GO targets. The company has notable plans for the region and is currently working on launching its offerings in several of the US jurisdictions. Play’n GO’s foray into Canada and the United States is a huge step for the company as it seeks to make its games available across the world.</p>
<p>Sissel Weitzhandler, the company’s chief risk, and compliance officer thanked the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario for the trust.</p>
<p>“The opening of Ontario’s regulated market is exciting and an important milestone in Play’n GO’s North America journey. We look forward to supporting our partners in Ontario from 4 April onwards,” Weitzhandler said.</p>
<p>She reiterated Play’n GO’s commitment to providing quality content and mentioned that the company hopes to launch its offerings in all regulated markets.</p>
