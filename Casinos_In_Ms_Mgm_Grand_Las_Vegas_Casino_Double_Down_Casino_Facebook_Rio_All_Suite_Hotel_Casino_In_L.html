<p>Last April, the leading British online gambling company bet365 inked an agreement to support the British greyhound racing scene. Now, the company has commented on the effectiveness of its decision to support the vertical.</p>
<p>Bet365 Is Excited to Support More Greyhound Events</p>
<p>A few months after the deal was inked, bet365 released a statement, saying is happy with the results of its sponsorship deal with greyhound racing in the United Kingdom. According to the operator, the agreement provides its brand with a lot of visibility during the best races in the sector.</p>
<p>Pat Cooney, racing spokesman for bet365, revealed more about his company’s view of the deal. He recalled the success of the greyhound Fabulous Azurra during the bet365 Empress Stakes Final, noting that the race provided bet365 with a lot of attention from greyhound racing enthusiasts. Cooney said that his team is looking forward to sponsoring more top-tier greyhound races.</p>
<p>The next race bet365 is going to sponsor is the bet365 Puppy Oaks in Towcester. After that, the operator plans to support other category 1 events in Oxford. Cooney said that his team is excited to put bet365’s name behind so many category 1 greyhound races.</p>
<p>Greyhound Racing Is Now an Integral Part of Bet365</p>
<p>Bet365 also spoke about the overall importance of greyhound racing to its mission. The operator considers it to be an “integral part” of its offering, which is why it is committed to supporting the sector.</p>
<p>While greyhound racing doesn’t enjoy as much popularity as some other sports, the betting company believes that it has the potential to be a leading betting discipline. Because of that, bet365 wants to support the sport and provide it with the resources it needs to engage sports and sports betting fans.</p>
<p>Bet365 believes that its commitment to greyhound racing will continue vitalizing the sector, while it provides customers with many exciting betting opportunities. Cooney concluded that the sport continues to be a consistent performer, which is why the operator will gladly support it in the months to come.</p>
<p>We wanted to promote Greyhound racing and were delighted to sponsor four Category 1 competitions, starting with our Empress Stakes at Towcester which attracted a good response in greyhound circles and on social media. Pat Cooney, racing spokesperson, bet365</p>
<p>The greyhound racing agreement marked bet365’s foray into the sector. The operator has been keen on expanding its product offerings and catering to a wide variety of demographics. For example, bet365 just launched esports betting products in the US, alongside Bayes Esports. Earlier, the company adopted Pragmatic Play’s bingo suite.</p>
