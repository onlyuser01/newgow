    <h1>Online Casinos Took My Money Casino San Antonio Pa Hollywood Casino Maximillion Casino Social Casino</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play has expanded its reach in the iGaming industry in Switzerland with a familiar local operator</p>
<p>The supplier has signed a fresh partnership with Swiss operator Grand Casino Bern and will focus on providing the company’s interactive brand with a string of innovative games from its own portfolio and across the slot and live casino segment.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Integrates Gaming Offer with 7melons.ch</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play will deliver a number of award-winning games to 7melons.ch, the online casino brand owned by Grand Casino Bern. Among the games that will be featured moving forward are such top choices as Wolf Gold, Sugar Rush, and Gates of Olympus.</p>
<p>The first integration will focus entirely on the implementation of the slot portfolio into the library of games. This will be followed by the addition of Live Casino games with titles such as Roulette, Blackjack and some of the more buzz-worthy Sweet Bonanza CandyLand and Boom City also added to 7melons.ch’s offer.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is happy to maintain a robust course of commercial success in 2023 as it has done in 2022, as the prominent partnership demonstrates. Commenting on the integration, company COO Irina Cornides noted that the supplier was extremely happy to be teaming up with Grand Casino Bern on this occasion.</p>
<p>It’s another positive step for the regulated market in Europe, Cornides noted, and what it means for the future of the company as part of this regulated market.</p>
<p>Looking Forward to the Future of iGaming in Switzerland</p>
<p>Grand Casino Bern director of online casino Bruno Peake was similarly pleased with the opportunity to team up with the company and see the 7melons portfolio expand a notch further. He also spoke about the future.</p>
<p>“It is another exciting step for our online brand, and we look forward to expanding our relationship with Pragmatic Play further,” Peake explained. Switzerland has been a focal point of supplier interest, with Playson recently launching Jackpots.ch as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, Wazdan signed a partnership for content distribution with Grand Casino Luzern’s digital brand, mycasino.ch.</p>
