    <h1>Resort Casinos Near Me Raging Bull Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes American Indian Casinos California</h1>

<p>Hi, thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I spoke to one of the chat representatives online and they made me aware of the t&amp;cs.</p>
<p>I think it’s ridiculous that they impose a limit on the value you can wager. But I understand that this is the reason I cannot withdraw. I do not deny the fact that I have wagered more than 30% on my last deposit as I generally deposit a lot of small amounts such as 5 lots of €100 on a given day.</p>
<p>But this being said, any average gambler will always increase bets as they start to accumulate wins as to increase the chances</p>
<p>of winning bigger.</p>
<p>I truly believe this clause is only implemented to stop gamblers from winning and withdrawing their winnings. Which I think is a breach of trust between the casino and me. I spent roughly 6 hours gambling anywhere between €1 and €200‘s a spin. But this was after accumulating a higher balance due to winning.</p>
<p>The fact that the games allow me to wager these amounts even though it would put me in breach of the t&amp;cs is crazy and shows that they want the gambler to easily be able to lose all of the winnings due to technical faults. Further to credit my balance with a total win of €39,950 and then to allow me to request a cash out only to then reject it when looked at by a physical person shows that this is a scam. They basically want you to do this so they don’t have to pay out.</p>
<p>I still have access to my gaming history but it is excessive as I was gambling for hours, they do not make it easy to retrieve this information and I would be required to wait for each line of information to download and then copy and paste into a separate document to forward it to you. To put that into perspective, there will be over 1000 lines of information to retrieve.</p>
<p>I was only aware of the t&amp;cs after I went to cash out.. and another point is the fact that they asked me for my personal details such as photos of proof of address, bank statements, driving licence, bank card when they clearly had no intention of paying out what is owed.</p>
<p>The bonus given was €50, there is no link as it’s a pop up chat box that offers you a bonus if you enter the word CASH, it then puts you through to a chat rep that adds €50 to your account.</p>
<p>thank you for looking into this for me, I hold very little hope in retrieving what is owed as I had great luck on the website and won a substantial amount.</p>
