<p>The marketing deal represents yet another way for Gateway to deliver excellent customer experiences</p>
<p>Gateway Casinos &amp; Entertainment has penned a new affiliate marketing deal with the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG). Under the deal, the former party will promote the operator’s online betting and gaming products to Gateway customers in Ontario.</p>
<p>The deal expands on the existing relationship between the two parties and will see Gateway spread awareness of OLG’s iGaming and online sports betting products. Gateway operates 14 casinos in Ontario on behalf of OLG and has been looking to develop and enhance the entertainment it offers. To that end, Gateway continues to deploy its signature casino and food &amp; beverage brands in the communities where it operates.</p>
<p>Under the new deal, Gateway Casino customers in Ontario will now get a link to OLG.ca where they can play a variety of online slots, table games, or wager on sports. The convenient OLG site allows Canadian gamblers to play no matter where they are.</p>
<p>At the same time, Gateway will remain committed to promoting responsible gambling and protecting players from harm. The company will leverage OLG’s PlaySmart program to continue shielding its customers from problem gaming.</p>
<p>Gateway is proud that all of its properties in British Columbia and Ontario hold RG Check accreditation, further attesting to its desire to protect players.</p>
<p>Gateway Seeks to Enhance the Experiences It Delivers</p>
<p>Tony Santo, Gateway’s chief executive officer, commented on the agreement, saying that it represents yet another way for his team to deliver excellent customer experiences. Thanks to the deal with OLG, players will be able to enjoy their favorite gambling offerings from their phones or laptops.</p>
<p>We will bring the action to them [the customers] through OLG.ca to keep the fun going in between visits to a Gateway casino. Tony Santo, CEO, Gateway Casinos &amp; Entertainment</p>
<p>OLG’s president and chief executive officer, Duncan Hannay, also commented on the matter, describing the deal as “another example” of how his team is working with its valued partners to grow the OLG brand and improve the gaming experiences for customers. Thanks to this, OLG is able to also increase its contribution to the people and Province of Ontario, Hannay added.</p>
<p>Gateway Casinos &amp; Entertainment continues to be one of the biggest gaming companies in Canada. The company operates 29 properties in Ontario and BC and owns two more venues in Alberta. The operator fields 7,000 people and offers thousands of slot machines and hundreds of gaming tables to its customers.</p>
<p>Visitors of Gateway’s venues can enjoy some of its proprietary dining brands, such as Match Eatery &amp; Public House and Atlas Steak + Fish or have fun at one of its Hally’s Club properties.</p>
