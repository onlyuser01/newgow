<p>Habanero, a prominent provider of table and slot games, is preparing to celebrate St Patrick’s Day on March 17 with a festive new game, Rainbow Mania, which has launched ahead of the holiday.</p>
<p>The properly-themed game delivers on much of the traditional Irish look you would expect from any top-performing St Patrick’s Day title, and takes that experience up a notch. The game is based on a five-by-three grid and offers fantastic visuals which do the celebration due credit.</p>
<p>Habanero has been happy to integrate a number of immersive mechanics and beautiful animations as part of the gameplay and create a product that will strike home with both players who feel in a festive mood and those who want to focus on a solid underpinning gameplay instead.</p>
<p>The game comes with a special Pot of Gold symbol which will be available on reels one and five. There is also the Expanding Wild on the center reel to add even more opportunities to score a win. Once triggered, this Expanding Wild is set to dish out some excellent rewards to players.</p>
<p>Rainbow Mania is all about free games, with 133 currently available, Habanero said in a press release. Company Head of Corporate Communications Toni Karapetrov welcomed the opportunity to add a yet another title to Habanero’s library of games that are built around Ireland and its fascinating world of leprechauns and hidden treasures.</p>
<p>"We’re always happy to revisit Ireland and give fans another mesmeric title that revolves around the fascinating world of rainbows, leprechauns and hidden treasures," said Karapetrov. Habanero has said that its new title comes with the company’s signature world-class mathematics and engaging audio-visuals on top of everything else.</p>
<p>Habanero is a prominent developer of online slots and table games. Since it launched in 2012, Habanero has delivered on more than 120 quality games and products. Apart from its staple slots and table games, the company has also ventured into the development of video poker titles.</p>
