<p>The leading provider of premium live casino content for regulated gambling operators, OnAir Entertainment, unveiled its plans for expansion and growth.</p>
<p>OnAir to Expand Further into the US</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the company revealed that it plans to significantly expand its footprint. This will be achieved via the launch of a nationwide US studio. In addition, OnAir Entertainment plans to enter new jurisdictions and expand its North American presence by offering localized content. A key part of the company’s plan is to expand the reach of its products and offer leading classic casino games that fuse quality with performance. OnAir Entertainment revealed that it has ambitions to offer content like Card Matchup, which is a new sports-themed live table game, as well as Double zero poker and roulette games. Moreover, the company plans to offer Dual Play content that enables operators to cross-sell online services via land-based venues.</p>
<p>Currently, OnAir Entertainment already offers a suite of live casino content. Since it was founded last year, the company was able to enter nine regulated gambling markets and launch its content in only 10 months. Only recently, OnAir entered the regulated gambling market in Canada’s most populous province, Ontario, and joined forces with multiple brands.</p>
<p>Now, OnAir Entertainment remains focused on growing further and plans to enter five US states and supply its leading live casino products. With that in mind, the company’s US-facing expansion under OnAir Entertainment US is expected to be led by a team of experts within the live casino industry. That team includes the company’s CEO, Andres Rengifo, its chief commercial officer, Simon Field, as well as its managing director for North Americas, Oliver Reid.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Follow Its Strategy</p>
<p>Oliver Reid, OnAir Entertainment’s managing director, Americas, commented: “The team is perfectly positioned to lead the US live casino market with world-class solutions, content and experience of successful multi-studio and innovative game rollouts for the world’s biggest brands in US regulated markets and we can’t wait to execute our strategy.” He pointed out that the US market continues to grow at a significant rate. In conclusion, Reid said that US brands will have the unique advantage to boost their growth by joining forces with OnAir Entertainment.</p>
<p>“OnAir Entertainment never stops innovating and we have a roadmap of classic, US market specific, state-of-the-art content that no other supplier in the industry can match.“ Simon Field, chief commercial officer at OnAir Entertainment</p>
<p>Simon Field, OnAir’s chief commercial officer, added that partners of the company liked its differentiated live casino content. He explained that this brought success for the operators, as well as OnAir. Field revealed that introducing innovations remains a key goal for the company. Last but not least, he acknowledged that OnAir has seen significant success in Ontario and expects to see the same for the market in the US.</p>
