<p>Swintt, an award-winning online casino game provider, has hired Domenico Vacchiano as the new chief architect. The company, which recently stepped foot in the Netherlands, is looking to strengthen its team and that is exactly what Vacchiano brings to the table.</p>
<p>Vacchiano Has Over Two Decades of Working Experience</p>
<p>Before joining Swintt, Vachianno spent more than a decade working in senior technical roles for top companies in the industry. That includes the likes of Gaming Innovation Group (head of technology and director of software development), Casumo (director of engineering), Cetena Media (head of software development), as well as WeAreCasino (chief technology officer).</p>
<p>Swintt’s CTO, David Flood, shared his thoughts on Vacchiano’s appointment. He said that Vacchiano is among the best software architects in the industry and noted that he was lucky enough to have worked with him in the past.</p>
<p>Flood also added that it is a pleasure and a major achievement to “bring in someone of this caliber” and that this is exactly what the company needs in order to progress to the next level. According to Flood, Vacchiano can be a massive guide to the company and help it introduce new, cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<p>The Responsibilities That Await Vacchiano, Explained</p>
<p>While talking about the appointment, Vacchiano stated that he’s “thrilled to join such an innovative company.” He also noted that Swintt continues to supply the global market with incredible games, which are featured at many of the top-tier online casino operators.</p>
<p>As a closing remark, he said that he will be working from the Sliema office and that he’s impatient to start contributing his technology and experience.</p>
<p>Contributing technology and experience will be one of Vacchiano’s main responsibilities. He will be in charge of a cross-functional team that will oversee Swintt’s certification in regulated markets. Additionally, Vacchiano will be in charge of promoting innovation, and inside business transformation, as well as delivering state-of-the-art, AI-driven tools.</p>
<p>Swintt is no stranger to supplying the market with top-notch products and that is something that the company was recognized for. Most recently, the company was among the winners at the EGR B2B Awards 2022 as it was recognized for its innovation in the mobile category.</p>
<p>Between 2021 and 2022, Swintt released a total of 44 mobile-friendly games, such as Rock N Ways XtraWaysTM, Orient Train and Extra Win X.</p>
<p>David Mann, Swintt’s COO, stated that Swintt is delighted to be the winner in the innovation in mobile and noted that the company had major competition and the fact that it managed to outgrow them all shows just how much it has progressed in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Mann ended by saying that Swintt is looking forward to sharing its technology with even more fans in 2022.</p>
