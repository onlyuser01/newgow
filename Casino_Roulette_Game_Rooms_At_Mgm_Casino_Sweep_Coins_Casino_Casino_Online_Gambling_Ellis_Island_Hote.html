<p>Inter Miami is desperate for points but winning them won’t be easy this weekend. It’s because “The Herons” are traveling to Pennsylvania on June 24 to take on the Philadelphia Union, one of the best home sides in the MLS</p>
<p>Inter Miami is without a single point won in the 2023 MLS in nearly 40 days. As a result, “The Herons” are stuck to the bottom of the Eastern Conference table, but the good news is that they can get away from there if they start winning points again. So, can they win a point(s) in Gameweek 21, against the Philadelphia Union?</p>
<p>It’s highly unlikely – if you ask oddsmakers. They think Philly will crush them on Saturday, June 24, one of the main reasons being that the game is played at Subaru Park in Chester, PA, which is where “The Union Zolos” are 6-2-1 in the 2023 MLS.</p>

<p>Philadelphia Union Looking Great in the Offense</p>
<p>Philadelphia Union played 2-2 with Orlando City earlier this week in a game which Daniel Gazdag skipped due to international duties. He played for Hungary against Lithuania on Wednesday, but is expected to return for the Union this weekend.</p>

<p>Philly’s playmaker is one of the best midfielders in the league. He’s a real commander in the center of the pitch, who’s got an eye for finding holes in the opposition defense. Gazdag and his teammates are great when it comes to game management, keeping the ball in their possession in order to stop their opponents from creating too many goal chances.</p>
<p>When it comes to scoring, that’s one of Gazdag’s roles, but with strikers like Julian Carranza and Mikael Uhre in front of him, he really doesn’t have the need to take shots too often. It’s just that these two are among the most complete forwards in the MLS – they’re fast, strong, great in the air, and incredibly lethal with their finishes.</p>
<p>Experience teaches us that the best time to witness their brilliance is when Philly is playing at home. Subaru Park is the place where Philadelphia Union has scored 17 goals in the nine MLS games this season while allowing just five.</p>
<p>Can Inter Miami’s New Coach Record His 1st Win This Saturday?</p>
<p>Inter Miami is 5-0-12 in the 2023 season. The club owner David Beckham and his partners blamed Phil Neville for this, which is why they sacked him from the position of manager a few weeks ago. They put Argentine coach Javier Morales in charge, but he hasn’t done much since the appointment.</p>
<p>On his debut, Morales saw his boys lose to Wayne Rooney’s DC united 2-1 at home. In his second game at the Inter Miami helm, his team got hammered by Bryce Arena’s New England Revolution 3-1.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time for his third game as Inter’s manager, and it seems the same thing is going to happen again. The thing is that his players just can’t get on target. At least not enough times. That’s strange because this team does have a couple of decent strikers on the roster. However, they’re probably only shine once Lionel Messi arrives.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Union vs. Inter Miami Prediction</p>
<p>Philly’s best player Daniel Gazdag was on international duty mid-week, which is why he missed Philly’s game with Orlando City on Wednesday. But he’s back on the Union roster now, and he’s ready to give all he’s got against Inter Miami on Saturday.</p>
<p>And when he’s in a good mood, Philadelphia usually scores a lot. That exactly is what we predict for this game. The hosts are going to win, and they’re going to do it by a large margin.</p>
<p>Pick: Philadelphia Union to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
