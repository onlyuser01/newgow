    <h1>Live Casino Pittsburgh Broken Bow Casino Blackbear Casino Pala Casino Hotel Live Casino Philadelphia</h1>

<p>Over the month of January I deposited roughly $17k USD over multiple deposits. Each deposit averaged around $300 USD and was executed along with a match bonus. After meeting all the wager requirements and playing slots I've managed to queue up 4 withdrawals that amount to a total 19194 over the course of that time. My largest and first withdrawal was for $9347.00 on Jan 16 and was "approved".</p>
<p>My verification documents have also been "approved".</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks I've been asking via chat what the status of my withdrawals are and have been told they are "under review" without any explanation as to why and when I can expect this to be completed. I've followed up repeatedly and keep being told that management is reviewing and I will get an email update in a couple days. The email never arrives and I repeat the same request every couple of days with the same response.</p>
<p>It doesn't appear they have any intention of paying as I played by the rules of the promotion codes to the letter.</p>
