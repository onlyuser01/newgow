<p>Levo Chan, the former CEO of junket Tak Chun Group and former chairman of Macau Legend Development, was charged by Macau’s Public Prosecution Office and is facing up to 20 years in jail.</p>
<p>Prosecutors Press Formal Charges</p>
<p>Chan and eight other people were formally charged by Macau’s prosecutors Friday after the investigation of Chan’s case was completed. Chan has been the only one of all nine indicted on the case to have been detained in prison.</p>
<p>He was arrested by Macau’s Judicial Police in January as part of a follow-up investigation after the fallout of Suncity on alleged involvement with a criminal organization, illegal gambling and money laundering.</p>
<p>Chan’s history in the Macau junket industry dates back to 2007 when he opened the first Tak Chun-run VIP Club at StarWorld, Galaxy Entertainment’s property. Named 21 in the 2021 Asian Gaming Power 50, Chan was instrumental in affirming Tak Chun as Macau’s number two junket operator by market share.</p>
<p>Chan also owns a 33.2% stake in Macau Legend Development since 2020 and later on was appointed chairman and CEO of the company operating Legend Palace and Babylon casinos under the SJM Resorts license.</p>
<p>Chan, whose case was directly linked to the case involving the arrest of Suncity chief executive officer Alvin Chau in November, is being held in Coloane Prison since its detainment earlier in the year.</p>
<p>According to Macau’s Judicial Policy, the group around Chan was not the same as the one operating via Suncity but authorities obtained enough information to prove that both groups worked together.</p>
<p>The arrest of Chau, who will be facing his trial in September, subsequently led to the company ceasing junket operations at the end of 2021. The prosecution said the investigation linked to HK$800 billion ($127.4 million) in alleged illegal gambling funds against a total of 21 people completed on May 26.</p>
<p>A recent report based on Chau’s 224-page indictment claimed that Suncity cheated Macau government with around $1 billion in tax revenue between 2013 and 2021.</p>
