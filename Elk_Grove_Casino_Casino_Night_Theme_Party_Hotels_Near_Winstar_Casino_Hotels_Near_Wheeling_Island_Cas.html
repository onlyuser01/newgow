    <h1>Elk Grove Casino Casino Night Theme Party Hotels Near Winstar Casino Hotels Near Wheeling Island Cas</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the recent experience I had while playing the Crash Game on your casino platform. The game malfunctioned, causing me to lose my bet, and the customer support I received was far from satisfactory.</p>
<p>Basically, the game/website lagged a bit on the bet id: casino:185174900817</p>
<p>Therefore, the button turned unclickable (after 1.3x-1.4x) so I refreshed the page (which happens frequently, even though, this is extremely unfair for such a live and sensitive game).</p>
<p>It took some time to load, so I opened my iPhone and once I did that, the round ended and the bet was auto-lost.</p>
<p>I was not using a VPN, my internet connection is fast.</p>
<p>Moreover, the next round started actually about 10 seconds later as a delay. Which is purely enough evidence that the game had lagged. I've been on the platform for over 2 years and I know how it works, also have had these things happen many times and if I would sum up my losses due to these bets, it would be over 5,000 USD over the period of 2 years.</p>
<p>For evidence, I bring up a screenshot called "stake-my-bet" which shows most if not all players who actually managed to cash out have their cashout at 2x - 5x - 3x (automated cashout). And since I don't like that automated cashout I always put high numbers to manually cashout. It's important to note that MANY have lost this round, even though it was a high multiplier (6.16x) so most players would cashout between 1.5x to 3x.</p>
<p>I also bring up a screenshot called "stake-similar-bet" which was about 20 games later on Crash with a very similar crash point multiplier, at 6.18x. There you can see how many players (most of them) have the cashout at random multipliers, like; 2.06x - 3.06x - 2.4x - 2.94x - 4.76x.</p>
<p>Reference game id: CrashGame: c9da86ab-f915-4fac-a3d4-69fa8d3943cd</p>
<p>This requires a very simple logic to understand that it was the site's fault and I am fed up with the support always having the same generic replies of VPN, rate limit, device cache, etc... Again, was not using a VPN, and I have a good connection, way enough for Crash to be smooth.</p>
<p>The technical team said that they checked the log and found no fault. However, I do claim that it was. Anyone who plays Crash regularly knows that, and this rare evidence is way more than enough of a proof.</p>
<p>Here's the chat log that outlines the issues I encountered:</p>

<p>User (Djordje profile):</p>
<p>"Crash lagged and I couldn't cash out, checked on my phone, same thing. It also took about 10 more seconds to start the next round, so it's definitely not my internet. What do we do?"</p>
<p>Casino Support (Djordje profile):</p>
<p>Explained the possibility of rate limiting due to VPN or excessive betting.</p>
<p>User (Djordje profile):</p>
<p>Expressed frustration, mentioned using a mobile phone on a 4G network, and the delay in the round starting.</p>
<p>Casino Support (Djordje profile):</p>
<p>Stated the possibility of rate limiting with Safari and Apple devices, advising against VPN use and providing some tips to avoid rate limiting.</p>
<p>User (Djordje profile):</p>
<p>Denied using a VPN and clarified that their internet connection was good.</p>
<p>User (Djordje profile):</p>
<p>Asked for a refund or bet win, considering the unusual delay in the round.</p>
<p>Casino Support (Djordje profile):</p>
<p>Explained that refunds for lost bets are not possible due to auto cashout settings and provided the multiplier for the round in question.</p>
<p>User (Djordje profile):</p>
<p>Mentioned other players not cashing out at that multiplier and questioned the situation.</p>
<p>User (Luka profile):</p>
<p>Took over the conversation, confirming no issues with the crash round.</p>
<p>User (Luka profile):</p>
<p>Shared another example of a recent crash at a similar multiplier, suggesting that most players don't cash out at set numbers.</p>
<p>User (Luka profile):</p>
<p>Requested a more in-depth explanation.</p>
<p>User (Luka profile):</p>
<p>Asked about saving the chat log or exporting it for a complaint.</p>
<p>Casino Support (Luka profile):</p>
<p>Explained that the chat remains accessible in their system.</p>
<p>User (Luka profile):</p>
<p>Requested a way to export the chat log for attaching it to a complaint.</p>
<p>Casino Support (Luka profile):</p>
<p>Offered to send a screenshot of the chat messages as a way to save them.</p>
<p>--- End of summed up chatlog ---</p>
<p>As a long-time user of your platform, I am deeply disappointed with the response I received. The delay in the game round starting and the loss of my bet was clearly beyond my control, and the suggestion of rate limiting due to VPN use, which I did not use, is highly inaccurate.</p>
<p>I look forward to a prompt and reasonable resolution of this matter.</p>
