<p>Ahead of the planned launch of the online sports betting market in Maryland, Gambling.com Group, the leading provider of player acquisition services for the growing online gambling industry, announced a major achievement in the state.</p>
<p>On Monday, the company revealed it secured a vendor registration certification from the gambling regulator in the state, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission. The latest licensing clears Gambling Group to offer its leading marketing services for online sports betting operators that hold a license in the state.</p>
<p>The recent announcement comes ahead of the planned launch of the online sports betting market in Maryland planned for Wednesday, November 23, 2022. With that in mind, thanks to the recent vendor registration certification by the regulator, Gambling Group can start offering its services as soon as the market in the state launches.</p>
<p>Caroline Smart, Gambling Group's Vice President, shared her excitement in a statement saying: "Maryland allowing sportsbooks to take legal sports bets just in time for Thanksgiving is a huge success for sports bettors in the state."</p>
<p>She added: "This is an exciting moment for sports bettors to finally place safe and responsible wagers with legal sportsbooks, after years of discussion and negotiation, and the robust offerings in the Maryland market will ensure there are plenty of choices and opportunities for customers." Finally, Smart said that the company will help sports bettors in the state when making decisions.</p>
<p>Charles Gillespie, Gambling Group's Chief Executive Officer, revealed that the upcoming online sports betting market launch in Maryland complements the ongoing expansion of the activity in North America this year.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the state has taken the right decision to allow different operators to enter the market. According to Gillespie, having multiple operators will create a competitive market that will ultimately benefit the customers. Finally, he said: "Gambling.com Group is well positioned to help operators and customers succeed in this next wave of regulated legal online sports betting in the United States."</p>
<p>Back in February, Gambling Group announced the launch of BetMaryland.com in anticipation of the launch of the legal mobile betting market in the state. The website offers unique insights and sports betting information for sports fans and bettors.</p>
<p>A report released back in September by BetMaryland shared an insight into what can be expected from the market in the state. The survey revealed that 24% or nearly one in four adults in Maryland, admitted they are likely or somewhat likely to place a wager once the mobile betting market launches.</p>
