<p>Designed with customer engagement and operator profitability in mind, the latest gamification feature is set to revolutionize the iGaming sector</p>
<p>The leading betting and software provider, NuxGame, announced the launch of PVP Battles, its latest innovative gamification feature. The new feature is designed in a way to boost user experiences and help operators grow. The Player versus Player Battles grant options for preconfiguring battle currency and conversion, as well as set entry timings.</p>
<p>Additionally, PVP Battles offer other configuration options such as jackpot boundaries, stake limits and battle types. Powered by innovation, the new feature seeks to boost customer engagement and bring unique incentives for the players. The participants can either create their own battle or play in arenas that are created by other players.</p>
<p>Ultimately, PVP Battles offer an immersive spin game that has a winner. The creator of each arena establishes a specific set of rules that need to be followed, thus creating a competitive element for the players, bringing additional thrills and excitement. The winner of each battle secures a jackpot prize which according to NuxGame “is made up of an accumulation of product points collected from each participant.”</p>
<p>An Evolutionary Leap in Player Engagement and Profitability</p>
<p>Denis Kosinsky, NuxGame’s chief operating officer, revealed that the innovative feature reaffirms the company’s commitment to boosting profitability and customer engagement for its growing portfolio of partners. Finally, he pointed out: “Redefining the limits of what’s to be expected of an iGaming experience, our PVP Battles are sure to unleash a competitive spirit in players as they duel against fellow users in an innovative and immersive setting.”</p>
<p>“Our PVP Battles is a testament to our commitment to staying ahead of the tech curve and boosting engagement and profitability for our valued customers.“ Denis Kosinsky, chief operating officer at NuxGame</p>
<p>According to NuxGame, PVP Battles isn’t just a new feature. The company revealed that they “represent an evolutionary leap in user engagement and operator profitability.” It added that thanks to PVP Battles, operators would be able to benefit from enhanced profitability and customer engagement, paving the way for growth and expansion.</p>
<p>Last month, NuxGame announced it forged a new deal with BETBY, a company specializing in sportsbook software. Under the terms of the agreement, BETBY agreed to power NuxGame with its leading sportsbook solutions that are already recognized for their innovation and scalability within the growing gambling sector.</p>
