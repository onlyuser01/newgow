<p>The UK Gambling Commission released data from its ongoing tracking of customer activities across all gambling verticals in the country. According to the latest figures, gambling revenue continued to decline in July, despite the return of the retail business.</p>
<p>Retail Contribution Significant</p>
<p>According to the data collected on all available betting products from the biggest operators which cover 85% of the retail betting market, gross gambling yield (GGY) from over the counter in July came up at £62.5 million, nearly 3 times more than the £21.5 million in June, mainly due to July being the first full month in which high-street betting shops were open.</p>
<p>Yield from self-servicing betting terminals (SSBT) grew to £23.1 million, from £9.6 million in June, and machine GGY was £81.6 million, nearly double the £41.6 million figure for the prior month. The Gambling Commission outlined though, that data was not comparable month on month due to factors such as retail not being in operation for a full month in June, phased openings for the different premises, local restrictions and the impact of restrictions on other gambling sectors.</p>
<p>Gross Gambling Yield Fell Across the Board</p>
<p>Looking at the online verticals, GGY in July fell across the board compared to the figures posted for the previous month, with the decline varying from between 2% and 4% for the high-yielding slots, online casino and betting on real events, to 17%, 23% and even 25% for the low-yielding betting on virtual, poker and betting on eSports.</p>
<p>All verticals except betting on real events continue on a downward trend from June, albeit with the decline slowing down. From May to June, real events betting posted 115% growth, almost double from the 64% increase from April to May, but the slight 4% decrease in July suggests the vertical peaked.</p>
<p>Total Number of Bets Per Vertical</p>
<p>Total number of bets per vertical in July confirmed the negative trend outlined by the GGY figures, as only betting on real events posted 5% growth compared to June, while online casino remained unchanged and total bets on slots fell 1%. The biggest decline month on month posted poker, with number of bets falling 22%, followed by virtual betting with 11% decline.</p>
<p>Regarding indicators for safer gambling, the Gambling Commission noted that the number of sessions lasting longer than an hour fell slightly in July compared to June, but still remained above the levels before the coronavirus crisis struck. The average gambling session in July remained unchanged compared to the prior month, slightly lower than the average one in March.</p>
