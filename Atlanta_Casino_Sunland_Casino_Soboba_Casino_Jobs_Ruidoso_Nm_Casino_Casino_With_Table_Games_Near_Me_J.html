<p>His appointment, first announced in April, sees the new Chair succeed his predecessor, Gary McGann, during a pivotal time for the gambling giant</p>
<p>As the new Chair of the board at leading gambling group Flutter Entertainment, John Bryant will lend his extensive management experience and industry knowledge to ensure the company’s enduring momentum and long-term success. Bryant had several months to prepare for his new responsibilities, making the transition significantly smoother for him and the rest of the board.</p>
<p>Bryant Is a Natural Fit for the Position</p>
<p>John Bryant’s potential appointment as Flutter board Chair emerged in April as Gary McGann reached his nine-year tenure as a non-executive director. The new hire’s extensive experience in leading US businesses was a leading factor in these considerations, aligning with the company’s growing focus on North America. His dual Australian and US citizenship and experience on many boards at high-profile companies made him a natural consideration.</p>
<p>Successful negotiations resulted in Bryant’s official appointment on 1 September, marking another significant milestone in his successful career. The new Chair has a strong track record in companies like Compass Group, Coca-Cola European Partners, and Kellogg, honing his senior management skills. Flutter CEO Peter Jackson was excited to work with Bryant and propel Flutter to new heights.</p>

<p>In addition to his role as Chair of the board, Bryant has taken up the position of Chair of the nomination committee and serves as a non-executive director. He used the opportunity to thank Gary McGan for his contributions to the company, lauding his predecessor’s expertise and professionalism. Although Bryant’s appointment should not have an immediate impact, his presence will substantially aid Flutter’s ambitions.</p>
<p>The Appointment Bolsters Flutter’s Rising Ambitions</p>
<p>Bryant joins Flutter at an opportune moment as the gambling giant recorded exceptional H1 performance. With impressive growth across most metrics, the company continues to capitalize on its prior investments and improve its market presence in targeted jurisdictions. Such bolstered financial flexibility will allow the new Chair ample opportunities to utilize his skills and deliver enduring success.</p>
<p>The new appointment should also be instrumental in Flutter’s ambitions for a US listing, complementing its existing presence on the London Stock Exchange. Working with many globally recognized US-based businesses has given Bryant a unique outlook, enabling him to assist Flutter in this process. Success would significantly bolster the company’s US-facing operations and compound its regional investments.</p>
<p>Bryant’s appointment marks a significant development in the leadership of Flutter Entertainment. His expertise and leadership experience will significantly bolster Flutter’s ongoing projects and help advance the company’s US ambitions, ensuring sustained value for its shareholders as the gambling giant aims for a record-breaking FY 2023.</p>
