<p>Good news poker aficionados, the Wynn Millions is back early next year, with the event running from February 21 through March 20. The series is touted as one of the largest to take place outside the World Series of Poker, the focal point of competitive poker in Las Vegas and most of the United States.</p>
<p>Plenty of Tournament Action Heading to Wynn Poker Room</p>
<p>Wynn has been actively seeking to attract more poker action on its casino floors, especially after being allowed to reopen following the nadir of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the latest iteration of the Wynn Millions Poker Series, the company will invite players to join the main $10 million guaranteed events as early as March 3.</p>
<p>Overall, the series will dish out prize pools to the tune of $15 million during several weeks of intense play. The buy-ins will vary from $400 to $10,000 for the Main Event, with several events on the circuit offering seven figures. Apart from the Main Event, players will have the Mystery Bounty NLH to look forward to in pursuit of a $1.5 million guaranteed prize pool.</p>
<p>Then, there is a Texas Hold’em No Limit event on March 13 and March 14 with a $3,5000 buy-in and a guaranteed $2 million prize purse. While the buy-ins are substantial for most of the events, they will also attract a professional crowd of poker players who are interested in exploring different formats and attempt to secure a win as an early warm-up for the next WSOP event.</p>
<p>Wynn Millions Shapes up as Worthwhile Format for Poker Fans</p>
<p>According to Wynn Las Vegas executive director of poker operations Ryan Beauregard, the 2021 event has proven to be a great milestone in the poker world and one that the hosts at Wynn are willing to run at least once again.</p>
<p>“The wide variety of players and personalities from around the globe who participate in this tournament makes it a world-class experience,” Beauregard said in a press release cited by Poker News.</p>
<p>The Wynn Poker Room has been busy with poker action, hosting numerous events in the run-up to the new year. With poker officially returning to The Strip, card rooms have been able to galvanize players into action and tap into pent-up demand. The card room just wrapped up The Wynn Winter Classic event, which finished on Monday.</p>
<p>Next year’s event will once again be covered closely by Poker News, which has been collaborating with the card room.</p>
