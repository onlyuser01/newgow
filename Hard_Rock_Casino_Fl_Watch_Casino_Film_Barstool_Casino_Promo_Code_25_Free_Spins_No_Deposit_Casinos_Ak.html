<p>Octoplay, an innovative up-and-coming content creator for the iGaming sector founded in 2022, has achieved a major milestone by deploying its cutting-edge titles with Flutter Entertainment-owned companies Paddy Power and Betfair.</p>
<p>The pair will benefit from several excellent titles developed in-house by Octoplay and integrated directly via the proprietary RGS platform. This is the first time that players in the United Kingdom will have access to Octoplay’s titles, which include a special category of titles known as Smash Games.</p>
<p>Octoplay is using this opportunity to further consolidate its presence in the market and establish itself as a leading and defining game studio that is set to appeal to the industry’s best-established brands.</p>
<p>Betfair and Paddy Power are both keen to continue strengthening their presence in the betting and gaming sectors, something they can achieve through forward-thinking integrations such as the one with Octoplay.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Paddy Power Games Head Andrew Kerr welcomed the chance to work with Octoplay and said that the games provided by the supplier truly resonated with the operator’s audiences.</p>
<p>"They are an impressive game developer led by a talented, experienced management team and with a portfolio of slots that players want to play," Kerr explained. This is a testament to the immense work that the studio has put in building products that are capable of catching the eye of the industry’s top-performing brands.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed on a similarly high note by Octoplay CEO Carl Ejlertsson who said that this marked another chapter for the company as it embarks on new opportunities in a fresh market.</p>
<p>"Paddy Power and Betfair are exactly the calibre of operators that we want to provide our games to, and these partnerships are a testament to the incredible work that the team puts into each game that leaves our production line," Ejlertsson added.</p>
<p>Octoplay has definitely had a very busy past month as the company has had several interesting developments to report. For starters, Octoplay secured the ISO 27001 certification, allowing it to push into more regulated markets.</p>
<p>The supplier obtained both a Swedish and Maltese gaming license that considerably expanded its reach and footprint, and once again reaffirmed the supplier’s commitment to be seen as a leader in the sector.</p>
