    <h1>Rio All Suite Hotel And Casino Biggest Casinos In The World Skydream Casino Mgm Casino Ohio Taj Maha</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had my account reopened at CosmoCasino in October 2022 because I thought the casino was great at the time. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>I made a deposit and received a bonus even though I didn't want to. Well, that was just the way it was. When I declined the other bonuses, the dilemma started. I lost the money with every slot, I thought it will come. Unfortunately, success did not come. With the sum of 5000€ that I had already paid in, I decided to ask what's going on and I didn't win anything. The friendly man in the chat encouraged me to keep trying and I'm sure I'll win a jackpot. I asked him if he tells everyone so that the game continues. And that it's not OK for me, if you take bonuses you win, if you don't take them you lose everything. He didn't give me an answer, just meant me should take a bonus. Well, I allowed myself to be persuaded and accepted the bonuses. You there, I won a small sum of €800 and when I put up €600 to withdraw I lost the rest straight away and it went on like this all the time. It was never paid out because I got some of the money in small steps. Inside I waited a few days to see if it would be paid out, but unfortunately the payout was delayed for several days before I withdrew the money. This was repeated many times. Then in I won €2000 and thought to pay out €1600 and keep playing with €400, this time it won't be that easy to lose the money. Wrong thought, in no time the 400€ were gone, a few euros won and it became less and less. Of the 1600€ I got 300€ so as not to have to deposit, as with the other payout. According to Casino Info, the payout should take place in 4 days, after 5 days the money was still there and when I checked in the evening on the same day, there were €1000 more on my gaming account and €1000 less in the payout loop. I have the 1000 € given back for payment and after another 4 days all the money was still there. Complaints directly to the support were not answered. So money down and in no time the money was gone. A few weeks ago I won something again, it was the same game. In the meantime I've paid in around €8,000 and I just want it back. There were no replies to my complaint emails, not even when I found out that I'm not actually allowed to play at CosmoCasino because I'm from Baden-Württemberg and the CosmoCasino page you displayed says: The players from Baden-Württemberg are not be accepted. I also complained because the wrong bank name of my bank was listed on Sofortüberweisung and the bank's logo is an Austrian logo and is not one of the German Raiffeisen banks. Then just contact Sofort and they only responded with they need this and that and that, but the actual question was never answered, questions were not answered.</p>
<p>This morning I had my account closed at CosmoCasino for the reason that things are not going well there. Something also went wrong with the slots. If you won more than usual the slots would start stuttering on spins, or just keep running, or just quit completely with the error message: Couldn't connect, it was always when you had a winning run, some sum was added won this happened when you logged back into the game to continue playing only lost. One of the CosmoCasino chat told me that he had heard this before but decided it wasn't true and then the chat ended. I hope you can help me.</p>
<p>They'll say it's my own fault, it's just a gamble. That's true too, but that wouldn't have happened with regular rules and since players from Baden Württemberg aren't allowed to play anyway, I'd still have my money today.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
