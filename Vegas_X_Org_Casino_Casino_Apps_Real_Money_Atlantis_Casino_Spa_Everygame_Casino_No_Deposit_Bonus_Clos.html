<p>New York’s Madison Square Garden Sports Corporation (MSG Sports) and Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corporation (MSG Entertainment) have announced a multi-year partnership agreement with Caesars Entertainment. Caesars is now an official sports betting partner for the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. It also becomes an official partner of MSG Arena, MSG Networks and Madison Square Garden Arena. The announcement follows Caesars Sportsbook becoming one of the nine recipients in New York of mobile betting licenses.</p>
<p>Caesars Gains Ground in New York</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook receives a branded space at MSG as part of the deal. That space is being planned and built, with a target of being open for the 2022-23 seasons. Caesars Reward program members can access the space at no additional cost during all Knicks or Rangers games.</p>
<p>The operator will also get media exposure through MSG Sports’ platforms and MSG Entertainment’s platforms. MSG Networks and Caesars Sportsbook are launching a new content series, “One Course With JB Smoove,” via MSG Networks. JB Smoove of Curb Your Enthusiasm, who acts as Caesar, will be featured in the content.</p>
<p>Ron Skotarczak is executive vice president of marketing partnerships for MSG Entertainment. He stated that Caesars Sportsbook, a well-known brand in the betting world, was thrilled to be welcomed to the MSG Sports family.</p>
<p>“Caesars Sportsbook plays a significant role in the expanding world of sports betting. This partnership will allow us to strengthen our brands’ connection with Caesars customers while providing the company with substantial exposure across our unparalleled set of assets.”</p>
<p>New Sports Betting Options Coming to New York</p>
<p>The winning bids included two recipients. Kambi submitted a bid that included PointsBet, Caesars Sportsbook, Resorts World, Rush Interactive and Wynn Bet. FanDuel was awarded a bid that included DraftKings, BetMGM and Bally Bet.</p>
<p>BetMGM formed a partnership earlier in the month with MSG Sports, MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports. This partnership saw BetMGM become an official partner of the Rangers and the Knicks.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook’s Madison Square Garden presence will include TV visible signage and in-arena LED messaging. GardenVision features and activations are also available on the court. Caesars Sportsbook branding and logos will also be featured on digital boards outside Madison Square Garden, as well as in the new Moynihan Train Hall.</p>
