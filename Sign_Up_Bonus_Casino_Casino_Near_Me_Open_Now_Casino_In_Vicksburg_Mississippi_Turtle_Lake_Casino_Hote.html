<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Peggy Sweets is an upbeat tune with a dance-worthy beat. Wins prompt ethereal chimes that add plenty of excitement to the moment.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see the entrance to a dreamy dessert café. With cheerful arrows pointing towards the establishment as well as the word ‘sweets’ decorated with lights, players will feel immediately welcome to grab the nearest seat.</p>
<p>On the reels, a variety of desserts can be found, from Jello topped with whipped cream to pancakes dripping with cherry syrup. Pink donuts and strawberry ice cream sundaes are also among the symbols.</p>
<p>The café is staffed by a number of quirky waitresses, each with a unique personality and hair color. One has pink hair and a demure expression, while another sports sapphire locks and a sassy attitude, and a third has golden locks and wise eyes.</p>
<p>The soundtrack and animation combine to create a dreamy world of sugary fun.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Peggy Sweets is a five-reel, five-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded when players land 8 or more matching symbols anywhere on the reels. The prize is proportional to the number of symbols and the value of the symbol.</p>
<p>After symbols have formed a winning combination, they will vanish, making way for new symbols to fall into the reels from above. This creates the possibility for further winning combinations.</p>
