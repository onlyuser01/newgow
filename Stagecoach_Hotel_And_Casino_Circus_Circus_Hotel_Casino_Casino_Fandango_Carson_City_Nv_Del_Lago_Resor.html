    <h1>Stagecoach Hotel And Casino Circus Circus Hotel Casino Casino Fandango Carson City Nv Del Lago Resor</h1>

<p>Violence against women in casinos and associated hotels has been a well-documented social ill that is being tackled rapidly by law enforcement. Whether you are Steve Wynn or a patron, you will answer to the same laws if committing crimes against women. Retribution now awaits Jamel Carlton, aged 36, from Saugerties, New York, who was found guilty of sexually assaulting a housekeeper in the Bally’s Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City back in 2018.</p>
<p>Carlton’s Wanton Violence Could Earn Him Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Carlton case reached a verdict on Thursday with the jurors finding him guilty on all counts, including sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated assault, criminal restraint, and not least, burglary. The information was released by the Atlantic County Prosecutor’s office.</p>
<p>Carlton was arrested twice on the same day in February 2018 in relation to two separate incidents in the hotel. The man was first confronted by authorities on the morning of February 15 when police responded to a domestic dispute complaint and found out that Carlton had assaulted his girlfriend in the casino’s parking garage. The woman was unnamed.</p>
<p>Hours after the accident a 51-year-old room service housekeeper filed a complaint that she had been sexually assaulted by a man. Police quickly established that it was Carlton who assaulted the maid and who was strolling down Atlantic Avenue at the time of his arrest. The Prosecutor’s Office issued a stern reprimand and lauded the victim’s strength for coming to testify against her abuser.</p>
<p>Carlton’s sporadic series of crimes committed in as many hours now set him up for a lengthy sentence with possible life imprisonment. His aggressive mistreatment of random women has prompted the jurors to find him guilty in unison. The Prosecutor’s Office also thanked the jurors for ruling in the case and delivering justice to the victim who was assaulted without provocation.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault an Issue in Casinos and Hotels</p>
<p>Sexual assault has been looked down upon in the United States, and especially in the casino industry. Steven Wynn, the founder and former CEO of Wynn Resorts, faced serious allegations of having assaulted a manicurist at the Wynn Las Vegas Casino. He has vehemently denied the accusations and threatened or sued anyone who claimed the opposite.</p>
<p>The case was eventually settled and Wynn was never proven to have actually assaulted the woman in question. This incident has cost him his personal and business life.</p>
