    <h1>Shazam Casino No Deposit Bonus Modo Casino 7Bit Casino 50 Free Spins Fort Lauderdale Seminole Hard R</h1>

<p>The casino engine provider has now signed a new important distribution opportunity that will put its mark with yet another prominent iGaming supplier</p>
<p>The new collaboration with ZeusPlay, a Greek casino games provider, will allow Relum to deliver even more products to its audiences. Relum already features more than 14,000 games and has more than 180 industry-leading suppliers as part of its aggregation platform.</p>
<p>ZeusPlay and Relum Collaborate on Distribution Opportunity</p>
<p>The company similarly works with a number of engagement and marketing tools that are designed to help partner operators to derive immediate benefits from their choice to work with Relum. The platform has integrated promotional tools that are a further opportunity for growth as well.</p>
<p>ZeusPlay will provide its dedicated portfolio of more than 50 excellent games which will be featured through Relum’s aggregation solution. Among the games that are being added are such prominent releases as Great Bufalo, Don Mafioso, and not least, Diamond’s Fortune.</p>
<p>The partnership was naturally welcomed by ZeusPlay CEO Antonios Zlatanos who said that the company was very excited to be strengthening its position in global iGaming markets through this new-found distribution opportunity.</p>
<p>Zlatanos said that the casino aggregation solution offered by Relum is a true stepping-stone for the company which will allow it to achieve better commercial results and engage with bigger audiences while also driving revenue.</p>
<p>“Relum’s customers will enjoy our 50+ games and in addition we are adding 1-2 new games in our pipeline every month,” Zlatanos said, outlining the future of the collaboration as well.</p>
<p>Leveraging Excellent Gaming Solutions with Sprawling Network of Operators</p>
<p>Relum CEO Emil Hakobian was similarly pleased with this new opportunity and said that his company is equally excited to strengthen its portfolio and content offering across the board, bringing in excellent growth opportunities for its supplier partners and gaming options for operators.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that ZeusPlay has integrated its offer with an established aggregation and tech supplier for the iGaming industry either. Previously, the company teamed up with NuxGame, joining the company’s aggregation solution and accessing even more audiences, operators, and business opportunities.</p>
