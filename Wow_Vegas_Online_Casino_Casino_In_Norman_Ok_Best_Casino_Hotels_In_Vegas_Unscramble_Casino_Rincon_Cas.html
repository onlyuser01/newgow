<p>Manchester City vs Tottenham is arguably the most exciting matchup of the 2022-23 Premier League Round 7. These two are the only teams that are still undefeated this season, each with a 4-2-0 record (14 points).</p>
<p>Oddsmakers, however, think the Spursâ€™ undefeated run will end on Saturday. They see Man City as the odds-on favorite in this game, one of the main reasons being that Pep Guardiolaâ€™s men have a 100% win rate at Etihad Stadium in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>However, thereâ€™s one thing that needs to worry them â€“ the last time they played Tottenham at home, they lost 3-2.</p>

<p>Manchester City Playing Amazing Soccer in 2022-23</p>
<p>It wouldnâ€™t be an overstatement to say that Man City is the most impressive team in the world right now. They are undefeated in the 2022-23 season, not just in the Premier League but in the UEFA Champions League as well. They played their first UCL game on Tuesday, beating Sevilla 4-0 on the road.</p>

<p>They did slip in the Premier League last weekend, playing 1-1 with Aston Villa. Still, the thing is that Lady Luck wasnâ€™t on their side in that game. Even though they were far superior to the Villans, they just failed to find the net more than once.</p>
<p>The fact that the game finished 1-1 is a huge surprise, knowing how amazing Pep Guardiolaâ€™s men have been in the offense this season. They scored a total of 20 goals in the first six rounds of the Prem, with the Villa game being the only one in which they didnâ€™t put way two or more goals.</p>
<p>Tottenham Know How to Get the Job Done</p>
<p>Although the Spurs havenâ€™t been as dominant as Man City, they have collected plenty of points so far in the Prem. Theyâ€™re now sitting in the #3 position in the EPL standings, just behind Sky Blues who also have 14 points. The reason why the Spurs are a spot lower is that their score differential isnâ€™t as impressive (12-5).</p>
<p>Antonio Conteâ€™s men scored more than two goals in only one EPL game this season. This, however, doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re not dangerous in the offense. On the contrary, with Harry Kane and Richarlison, they look like one of the most dangerous teams in the Prem.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Tottenham Prediction</p>
<p>Manchester City should win this game, but itâ€™s not going to be easy. We expect Tottenham to fight back, possibly scoring a goal or two.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester City to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
