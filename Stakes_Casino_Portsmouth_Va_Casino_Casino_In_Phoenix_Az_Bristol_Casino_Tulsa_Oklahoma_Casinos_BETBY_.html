    <h1>Stakes Casino Portsmouth Va Casino Casino In Phoenix Az Bristol Casino Tulsa Oklahoma Casinos BETBY</h1>

<p>BETBY, an innovative supplier of sports content for sportsbooks, has signed a new partnership with Roobet, a major cryptocurrency casino and operator. All BETBY content will be integrated with Roobet’s own sportsbook through the Slotegrator platform which is facilitating the content injection.</p>
<p>BETBY Teams up with Roobet for LatAm Growth</p>
<p>The partnership will focus on Latin America as its principal region as Roobet has a significant stake in markets and is keen to increase growth in this specific geography. Roobet is represented both in the sports betting as well as esports space. The operator runs the namesake Roobet Cup Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournament.</p>
<p>BETBY has been on a solid expansion move over the past months, enjoying steadfast growth in 2022. The company has partnered with prominent brands in the gaming space, including BC.GAME and Gamingtec. Commenting on this opportunity, BETBY CCO Chris Nikolopoulos said:</p>
<p>Roobet is an operator with a growing reputation and we’re very pleased to be able to bring our leading sportsbook solution to its brand. BETBY CCO Chris Nikolopoulos</p>
<p>Nikolopoulos confirmed that both Roobet and BETBY have a strong focus on esports which will help them build up a future-proof product and offer a modern betting experience. The partnership was similarly welcomed by Roobet head of sports Viktor Kareliusson who said that BETBY’s sportsbook offer speaks for itself. There is a wealth of markets and competitions to tap into and Roobet was happy to continue with this partnership.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait to work closely with BETBY to achieve our business goals, and offer an outstanding sportsbook alongside our casino products,” he concluded. BETBY has recently completed the separation of its esports business, as the company is keen to continue expanding in this vertical and a dedicated division is all but necessary.</p>
