    <h1>Promo Codes For Doubleu Casino Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Spotlight Casino 29 Hotels With Casino</h1>

<p>Hello, I have been waiting almost 30 days to get my account verified, and today I received a message saying that my account is suspended and my money has been taken from me.</p>
<p>First of all, I already spoke with my lawyer, and I am taking legal action against you because you are accusing me of something that I didn't do, and you are refusing to give me proof of any type of "fraud" as you say it and you stole my money.</p>
<p>Okay, first, you are accusing me of multi-accounting. I created my account a few months ago, and I started playing on your platform one month ago. This is my only account on your platform, and I never even tried to create another account. I want you to show me proof of another account with the same name, email, phone number, birth date, household, device, IP, or something else...</p>
<p>Second, you are accusing me of violations of the terms and conditions of promotions. Can you point out exactly where I broke any rule or violated the terms and conditions of any offer? Every bet I made was according to the bonus terms and conditions. Never exceed the maximum bet amount, and never place bets that guarantee me profit from any promotion. I want you to give me proof and explain how I broke any promotion rule and violated bonus terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, you are accusing me of fraud, multiple accounts, and multiple entries, which violates any promotional terms and conditions. So, I already asked you to give me an explanation for the multiple accounts accusation, and now I want you to explain how exactly I committed any fraud when I sent all documents you required immediately without any delay and I already explained that I never broke any promotional rule, which I can prove. Also, what is that for multiple entries? Of course, sometimes I was using my account from my phone and sometimes from my PC. I highly doubt that you suspend every player for using his account from his PC and Mobile phone. Of course, the IP might be different when I log in from my phone because I use 4g mobile internet, and on my PC, I use my WiFi.</p>
<p>So, I will wait for an answer and explanation of how I violated any of these rules. If you refuse to give me this information and you steal my money, I believe I have a very high chance of winning this case in court.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
