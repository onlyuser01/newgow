<p>Brit Steals from Employer to Play the Lottery, Avoids Jail</p>

<p>A Brit who dipped his hands into his employer’s pocket to gamble over three weeks has had his day in court. He cost the business £11,000 (US$14,402) but won’t have to go to jail to pay for his crimes.</p>

<p>Daniel Cuthbert, a former manager of a restaurant in the UK, stole from his employer to cover his bills and gambling habit, according to The Scarborough News. Over three weeks, Cuthbert stole a combined £11,926 (US$15,612).</p>
<p>The 28-year-old was handed a minimal sentence for his crimes after appearing before a judge this week. The judge handed down a one-year sentence. However, he suspended all of it for 18 months, provided Cuthbert successfully carried out 150 hours of community service.</p>
<p>Cuthbert worked as the branch manager for Stew &amp; Oyster restaurant in Malton, about an hour to the east of Leeds, UK.</p>
<p>Lack of Lottery Luck Leads to Losses</p>
<p>Cuthbert, a father of two, had bills piling up at home, exacerbated by his penchant for the lottery. As a result, he used his position at the restaurant to launch a scheme in December 2019. Since he was in charge of making bank deposits, he could take some money, gamble, win, and replace what he took.</p>
<p>Stew &amp; Oyster’s bosses asked him about January’s discrepancies in the books. He promised to look into it, falsely stating that the restaurant’s “bank book had gone missing.” He ignored several attempts by the company to find out what happened and was subsequently fired.</p>
<p>The restaurant then contacted the police, who picked up Cuthbert. He had been expecting their visit and admitted to his transgressions. Cuthbert told them that he was only trying to “pay off his debts” while seeking a comfortable life for himself and his family.</p>
<p>Date With a Judge</p>
<p>Last Friday, after two long years of sweating over what might happen, Cuthbert had his day in court. It may have been the luckiest day he had experienced in a very long time.</p>
<p>Judge Simon Hickey was sympathetic toward the situation of the father and breadwinner. He pointed out the errors that Cuthbert had made but acknowledged that he appeared to be genuinely remorseful. This, and his ready admission of guilt, played a role in Cuthbert’s sentence.</p>
<p>As for the money Stew &amp; Oyster lost, the company isn’t likely to see it again. The judge reportedly didn’t order restitution and only fined Cuthbert £1 (US$1.31). Having no assets, no cash savings, and providing 150 hours of work for free wouldn’t go very far in trying to pay back the stolen funds.</p>
