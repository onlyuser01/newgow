<p>The appointment comes ahead of Allwyn’s takeover of The National Lottery</p>
<p>Allwyn UK, the successor of Camelot as The National Lottery operator, announced a major new appointment. According to the announcement, Steve Parkinson, a former Bauer Media leader, will join the Allwyn team as its new brand and marketing director.</p>
<p>In this new position, Parkinson will leverage his expertise to grow The National Lottery and help it generate more funds for good causes. In this position, Parkinson will replace Ivor Burns who is set to step down from his position after 14 years with The National Lottery.</p>
<p>Allwyn pointed out that Parkinson is a former Bauer Media employee who held several senior marketing and business leadership positions. He oversaw the growth and brand development of Kiss, Magic, Absolute Radio, Jazz FM, Planet Rock and more. Parkinson also boasts experience in leading post-acquisition integrations, Allwyn added.</p>
<p>Before joining the UK’s most influential media brand network, Allwyn’s new hire served as EMAP’s marketing and brand director. In this position, he managed a portfolio of consumer brands across multiple channels, as well as a roster of creative and media agencies. His track record also includes a decade at Chrysalis where he held a number of senior roles.</p>
<p>The appointee will bring a wealth of experience in transforming brands to Allwyn UK’s team, as well as extensive knowledge of media partnerships and creative production. His appointment comes ahead of Allwyn’s takeover of The National Lottery and in the wake of Mark Hughes’ appointment as chief security officer.</p>
<p>Parkinson Is Excited to Join Allwyn in Such an Important Time</p>
<p>Parkinson expressed his excitement about the opportunity to join Allwyn at such a pivotal time for the company. He said that he is excited to work with Allwyn on raising money for good causes.</p>
<p>The National Lottery is a huge part of UK life and contributes so much to society through Good Causes funding – so to come on board at the very beginning of a new era, with a new operator, is incredibly exciting. Steve Parkinson, brand and marketing director, Allwyn</p>
<p>Allwyn’s chief commercial officer, Lucy Buckley, welcomed Parkinson to the Allwyn family, lauding him as a “proven marketing leader.”</p>
<p>We’re excited about what he can bring to Allwyn and The National Lottery, with his wealth of experience in senior marketing roles. Lucy Buckley, CCO, Allwyn</p>
<p>Buckley also used the opportunity to thank Burns for his enormous contribution to The National Lottery which left The National Lottery’s brands “in great shape.”</p>
