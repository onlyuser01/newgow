<p>SharpLink Gaming is making another recruitment move with the appointment of Tom Masterman. The new hire will be stepping in as VP of revenue and he will focus on building up the company’s customer and partner relationships. Masterman who is an industry veteran brings valuable experience to the table, with his 10 years of working for some of the largest sports data companies, including Genius Sports and Sportradar.</p>
<p>New Hire Given a Warm Welcome</p>
<p>Working closely with company CEO Rob Phytian, Masterman brings a fresh set of skills to the table to help advance the immediate and long-term strategic goals of the company. Pythian welcomed Masterman’s arrival and said:</p>
<p>Tom was a key member of my executive team at SportsData and Sportradar US, so I am keenly aware and appreciative of the deep skill, industry relationships and business-building talent that he brings SharpLink. CEO Rob Phytian</p>
<p>The executive further added that the whole company was thrilled to see him join and that they expected his addition to helping with the company’s long-term growth. Masterman is immediately arriving from ShotTracker, another competitor, where he worked as VP of sales and where he successfully cultivated business relationships with CBS Sports and ESPN.</p>
<p>For his part, Masterman is a well-seasoned industry heavyweight. He has been able to secure data rights for the NBA, NHL, NFL, and NASCAR during his stints at various companies. He helped Sportradar to sign up for Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, and DraftKings, among others.</p>
<p>Masterman’s Track Record Speaks for Itself</p>
<p>His industry connections and understanding of the industry make him a perfect fit for the industry. Masterman is confident that he has joined the right team. He also praised Pythian and added:</p>
<p>Together, we accomplished great things at SportsData and Sportradar, so I’m looking forward to once again leveraging our complementary strengths to drive SharpLink’s growth and help to ensure we ultimately dominate the fast-emerging sports betting conversion market. SharpLink VP of revenue Tom Masterman</p>
<p>Pythian and Masterman previously worked together at SportsData and Sportradar, as suggested by the executive. The pair are now going to bring this successful and business-defining dynamic to a new home, but always with the idea of pursuing excellence.</p>
