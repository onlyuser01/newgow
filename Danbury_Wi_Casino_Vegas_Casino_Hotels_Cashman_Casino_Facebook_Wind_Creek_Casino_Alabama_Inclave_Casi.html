<p>Gaming technology solutions specialist Aspire Global announced it signed a platform agreement with new multi-vertical gaming brand Luckster.com to power its European and Latin American regulated offering ahead of the brand’s upcoming launch.</p>
<p>Agreement Covers Entire Offering</p>
<p>The agreement between Aspire Global and the gaming brand founded by industry veterans is the first to cover the entire range of proprietary offering across platform, sports and casino games of the technology solutions provider.</p>
<p>“This partnership is clear proof that Aspire Global has established itself as a powerhouse for iGaming operators.” Jov Spiero, VP, Sales, Aspire Global</p>
<p>The acquisition of leading game aggregator platform Pariplay in 2019 and sports betting operator BtoBet in September 2020 helped Aspire Global strengthen its portfolio with a game aggregation platform, in-house game production, and a world-class sportsbook.</p>
<p>Luckster.com is initially launching its products across sports and casino verticals into regulated markets in Europe and Latin America, but, facilitated by Aspire Global’s presence in multiple regulated jurisdictions, is planning to expand further later on.</p>
<p>“When we were searching for a platform for Luckster.com, we knew that we wanted to partner with a company that is widely respected in the industry and which could lead us into the many new regulated markets around the world. Aspire Global ticked all the boxes and offers us peace of mind as a public company that we can trust.” Mike Batenburg, Owner and Managing Director, Luckster.com</p>
<p>Aspire Global On the Rise</p>
<p>Founded in 2005 to develop “the most comprehensive and robust” gaming industry solution, Aspire Global currently boasts presence across America, Africa, and most of Europe, and has partnered with more than 60 gaming brands to supply them with fully certified games.</p>
<p>“Our broad geographic footprint in four continents and outstanding offering make us the first choice among iGaming suppliers. We look forward to leveraging the power of our offering in order to build a strong partnership and maximise Luckster.com’s opportunities.” Jov Spiero, VP, Sales, Aspire Global</p>
<p>The services of the B2B provider of iGaming solutions complement its recently revamped player account management (PAM) platform, AspireCore, which offers Aspire Global partners access to a variety of games via the Pariplay aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Aspire Global delivered impressive financial performance in 2020, posting record revenues and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The tech gaming company posted €161.9 million in full year revenue, up 23.2% compared to the previous 12-month period, while EBITDA came up at €27.1 million, an increase of 24.8% year-over-year.</p>
