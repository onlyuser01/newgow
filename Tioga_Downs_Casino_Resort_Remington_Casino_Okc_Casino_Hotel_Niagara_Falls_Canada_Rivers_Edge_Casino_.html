    <h1>Tioga Downs Casino Resort Remington Casino Okc Casino Hotel Niagara Falls Canada Rivers Edge Casino</h1>

<p>Barcelona and Inter Milan play a rematch of their last week’s Champions League duel, which the Italian team won 1-0. This time, however, the game is played on Barca’s turf and oddsmakers believe that it could be the decisive factor. They see Barcelona as an odds-on favorite in Wednesday’s match.</p>

<p>Barca Needs to Get Back on the Winning Track</p>
<p>Barcelona is 1-0-2 in the Champions League, which puts them in the #3 position in Group C. The trouble is that this group is very competitive, with Bayern Munich at the top (9 points), and Inter Milan in second place (6 points).</p>
<p>That said, in order to qualify for the knockout phase, Barcelona needs to start winning again. Luckily for Xavi’s boys, Wednesday’s game with Inter Milan seems like an ideal opportunity for that. First of all, it’s because Barca players usually perform great when playing in front of the home crowd. At Camp Nou, they’re without a single loss since May.</p>
<p>Another reason why Barcelona seems to stand a good chance to triumph on Wednesday is that Inter Milan’s roster is decimated by injuries.</p>
<p>Inter to Miss (at Least) Three Key Players</p>
<p>The good news is that Inter Milan has one of the longest benches in Europe. This team has at least one excellent player for every position on the pitch. Unfortunately, several of their crucial players will miss the game with Barca.</p>
<p>Romelu Lukaku, who’s supposed to be their key goalscorer, remains sidelined with a leg injury. Playmaker Correa is also out, and the same goes for Brozovic.</p>
<p>Barca too has its fair share of injury problems, but Inter’s seem to be more serious. Without the aforementioned players on the pitch, the Italian side probably isn’t going to be able to dominate the game on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Barcelona vs Inter Milan Prediction</p>
<p>This game should be the opposite of the one they played last week. This Wednesday, we think Barcelona is going to win and there are going to be plenty of goals.</p>
<p>Speaking of goals, the man most likely to score at least once is Barca’s goal-scoring machine, Robert Lewandowski. Oddsmakers agree with us, as evident from the fact that the bet “Lewandowski to score anytime” comes with the odds of just -110.</p>
<p>Picks: Barcelona to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
