    <h1>Casino Royale Movie 1967 South Point Casino Buffet Park City Casino Gun Lake Casino Wayland Mi Islan</h1>

<p>3293.3 sorry I misspelled it didn't take the comma, yesterday the casino sent me this email:</p>
<p>HELLO MARCO,</p>
<p>Based on the results obtained from a security check on your account, you will need to send us the documents requested below.</p>
<p>As established by AAMS, sending this documentation is mandatory when requested, therefore your possible withdrawal will remain pending until the verification is complete.</p>
<p>Game account owner documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>We inform you that you will need to send us proof of residence in full and no older than 6 months. We accept bills, bank statements, family records and proof of residence. We do not accept self-certifications and identity cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have SPID, you can download a Family Certificate or a Residence Certificate from the website www.anagrafenazionale.gov.it . Click on "Access Citizen Services". Log in with SPID as authentication method. After that you can download the requested document and send it to us by email.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can ask your credit institution for an account statement indicating the requested data.</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of card 535456<strong>*</strong>*0071 leaving the first 6 and last 4 numbers uncovered and covering the central ones. If the name and surname of the holder is not present on the card, you will have to send us an account statement or a list of movements, where the card number, name and surname are present or that the card has been closed and extinguished.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think he therefore accepted the selfie and the new alternative document provided</p>
<p>but the bank document provided as proof of residence was refused and the card I don't know what to send it being a virtual revolut without my name on it</p>
