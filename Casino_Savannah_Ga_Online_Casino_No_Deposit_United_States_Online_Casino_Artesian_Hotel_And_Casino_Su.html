    <h1>Casino Savannah Ga Online Casino No Deposit United States Online Casino Artesian Hotel And Casino Su</h1>

<p>The popular developer that has gained prominence with the deployment of its unique Slingo feature is expanding in yet another market, bringing its library to GoldenPark</p>
<p>Gaming Realms, which is the author of many reimagined iGaming titles that have been redesigned to include the Slingo mechanic, is now expanding into the regulated market in Spain, growing its local presence with the established operator.</p>
<p>Big Demand for Slingo Games in Spain</p>
<p>The company has managed to take many popular and successful games and cast them through the prism of Slingo, with titles such as Slingo Sweet Bonanza, Slingo Cleopatra, Slingo Reel King, Slingo Da Vinci Diamonds, and Slingo Stardust just some of the company’s top-performing blockbusters.</p>
<p>Slingo has already been proven as a successful format and enjoyed a strong reception in the Spanish market, with Gaming Realms doubly enthusiastic about the expansion of its product offer.</p>
<p>GoldenPark makes for a great partner to this end, as the company is represented both in the land-based and online gaming sectors in Spain, and this tie-up will allow the company and its Slingo games to reach even wider audiences.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership opportunity Gaming Realms Regional Account Manager Mariachiara Lagravinese:</p>
<p>Having only entered the Spanish market last year, we have significantly grown our presence recently and the Slingo content is really starting to resonate with the local audience. Taking our games live with GoldenPark is a great achievement for us and a testament to the growing popularity of our content in the market and we are excited to further build on this partnership. Gaming Realms Regional Account Manager Mariachiara Lagravinese</p>
<p>GoldenPark Director of Operations Andrés García has also welcomed the opportunity to further diversify the company’s portfolio and offers.</p>
<p>Bringing Differentiation to a Crowded Marketplace</p>
<p>He called Spain a crowded marketplace but also a lucrative one where the incorporation of fresh products into gaming libraries, such as Slingo, truly gives local operators the means to differentiate.</p>
<p>“By offering our players Gaming Realms’ unique portfolio we add a new level of entertainment to our online casino that will strengthen our proposition and attract a new audience,” García concluded. The Slingo mechanic is not just some novelty that operators want to have.</p>
<p>The feature has been making forays in multiple markets and with some of the biggest brands in the world of gambling. Entain even acquired a license from Gaming Realms to develop its own Slingo game.</p>
