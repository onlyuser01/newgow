<p>Grant Dawson Determined to Prolong His Undefeated Run</p>
<p>Grant Dawson is 20-1-1 in his professional career, with his only loss happening back in 2016. One of his fights finished in a draw ‚Äì against Ricky Glenn in 2021 ‚Äì while all of his remaining fights, he won with relative ease. Sixteen of his 20 wins were finishes, with submission being his favorite method (13 wins).</p>

<p>This shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone because Dawson is a fantastic wrestler who lands almost four takedowns per fight. It‚Äôs very likely he‚Äôll try to take Green down on Saturday and try to finish him on the floor.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs giving him confidence that he‚Äôs going to win the UFC Fight Night 229 headliner is that he‚Äôs got good experience against great strikers such as Green. For instance, he defeated Kazakhstani knockout master Damir Ismagulov in his most recent fight.</p>
<p>Bobby Green Wants to Make Himself Relevant Again</p>
<p>Bobby ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Green is a 37-year-old veteran who‚Äôs been fighting professionally since 2008. He‚Äôs won 30 fights, while losing 14. Plus, one of his fights resulted in a draw, with one being declared no contest.</p>
<p>He used to be a big thing in the UFC, but his recent run isn‚Äôt too impressive. He lost two of his last four fights, suffering a KO/TKO loss in both of those ‚Äì against Islam Makhachev and Drew Dober.</p>
<p>Then, in the fight with Jared Gordon, the two clashed heads by accident for which the ref had to stop the fight and declare a no contest. Green did win his most recent fight, but it happened against Tony Ferguson, who lost five fights in a row before that.</p>
<p>Grant Dawson vs. Bobby Green Prediction</p>
<p>Grant Dawson is much better when it comes to grappling/wrestling than Bobby Green. However, ‚ÄúKing‚Äù is much better striking-wise. Nevertheless, Dawson has already proved he knows how to deal with such fighters. He defeated Ismagulov in June, and we think he can do the same to Green.</p>
<p>Pick: Grand Dawson to win</p>
