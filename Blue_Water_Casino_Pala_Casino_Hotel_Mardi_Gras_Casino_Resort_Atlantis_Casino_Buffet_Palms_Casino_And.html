<p>Wealth Inn review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Wealth Inn has a Chinese luxury tavern theme.</p>
<p>Players will ride up to a mysterious inn in a dense forest of bamboo. Weary from their travels, they’ll duck in to find luminous red lanterns and an enchanting atmosphere.</p>
<p>Weath Inn is a good choice for fans of Eastern themes and cheerful aesthetics. It leans into some cartoonish stereotypes, but this is part of the fairytale vibe.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The laidback traditional Chinese soundtrack is filled with zither notes and regal ambiance. The reels spin with a delicate beep that seems to be from a much more modern century. Wins are celebrated with a gentle gong sound and chiming.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with precious Chinese artifacts and tantalizing fruits. Ornate knot symbols in gold, red, and green are especially eye-catching.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are glossy red and framed by golden designs. Behind the reels, players will see an inviting open-air room decorated in vivid red and lit by swaying lanterns.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Wealth Inn create a warm and exotic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wealth Inn is a three reel, three row slot with 8 win lines.</p>
<p>Winning combinations are calculated from the leftmost reel towards the rightmost. Only the highest win on each line pays.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. There is a special symbol that transforms into a Wild and expands to fill its reel whenever it is part of a winning combination.</p>
<p>This slot is quite sparse when it comes to further bonus features, and players won’t find many fan favourites here.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.64%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.08 up to a maximum of $/£/€80.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low, which makes it a poorer match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this high RTP, low volatility Chinese tavern-themed slot.</p>
<p>With a colorful frontend and respectable RTP, Wealth Inn is on the right track, but due to its decisively low volatility, it does not merit a strong recommendation. Players with a mathematically inclined mindset will do better to seek out slots with a more robust volatility.</p>
<p>Given the popularity of East Asian themes, it is more than possible to find a similarly themed slot with more strategy-friendly volatility.</p>
<p>Wealth Inn also offers quite minimal bonus features, making it somewhat less engaging than it could have been.</p>
