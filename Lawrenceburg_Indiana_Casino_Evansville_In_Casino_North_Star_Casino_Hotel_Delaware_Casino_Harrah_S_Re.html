    <h1>Lawrenceburg Indiana Casino Evansville In Casino North Star Casino Hotel Delaware Casino Harrah S Re</h1>

<p>Dear CH4RL3I,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the Responsible Gaming section of Stelario Casino (here) , and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>We at Stelario believe that gambling should be fun and free of harm and only done for entertainment purposes. Before you start playing at Stelario, it is very important to understand that gambling should never be viewed as a source of any kind of income or recipe to pay off your debts. We strongly recommend you to keep track of how much time you spend playing casino games and how much money you can afford yourself to spend on them. Although recommendations stated above might seem obvious for some of you, there are still certain percentage of players who lose control over such things when playing. If you think you might be one of those players and gambling has negative impact on your life or life of your family and friends, we can suggest you one of the following things: You can always contact our support department at support@stelario.com and ask to terminate your Stelario account for a certain period of time. After that we will take necessary measures to completely block you from our site and block any promotional e-mails that you might have been receiving from our casino before. Please contact customer support team if you want to set a personal cooling-off period. You can also seek for help from professionals who deal with gambling problems:</p>
<p>Gamblers Anonymous, GamCare, Gambling Therapy."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t written that all your accounts in other casinos of the same owner will be blocked or self-excluded automatically. Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites. Since this casino is licensed by Curaçao, not even Licensing Authority enforces this. Could you please advise if you have requested a self-exclusion from Stelario Casino directly?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
