    <h1>Twin Rivers Casino How To Do The Diamond Casino Heist Parker Az Casino Games Casino Live Casino Phil</h1>

<p>On August 4th, I collected a free $30 USD chip since the terms stated that my country had no issues or limitations in playing and withdrawing with the promotion. I fulfilled the betting requirement to be able to withdraw, totalling $165.77.</p>
<p>Upon completing the betting requirement, $65.77 was deducted (since the maximum withdrawal was $100).</p>
<p>August 14th:</p>
<p>When I tried to withdraw, I was told I had to make a deposit along with KYC verification (I made a deposit in T-USD, which never arrived in my account, I figured there was just network delay at the time). After this, verification indicated that the deposit should be in BTC and not T-USD, I made such a deposit, which reached the account within minutes, and my account became verified.</p>
<p>After this, I made a withdrawal request once my identity had been approved.</p>
<p>In the end, between deposits, playing, and waiting, I ended up making a withdrawal request for $133.60. I was led to believe that the withdrawal would take three to five days (even though they state on their page that withdrawal is within 24 hours).</p>
<p>August 22nd:</p>
<p>Seeing that the deposit hadn't reached my account, I logged into the casino to check the status of the request. To my surprise, that same day, absent any prior notice, they cancelled my withdrawal and made another one for $133.60 USD (this was performed by a manager according to the transactions). In addition to this, they credited me $14USD worth of "promotion" credits, which obviously I could not withdraw. Because the other withdrawal was still pending, I played, lost, and was left with an account balance of $0.31.</p>
<p>Today, being the 24th of August, I contacted support (which is not 24/7 as their page claims), asking about my withdrawal. I was told that my country isn't valid and is not allowed to withdraw with the no-deposit bonus. They said I could deposit and play freely. At that moment, I checked the terms and conditions, and saw that nearly all countries were listed as not eligible to withdraw with the no deposit bonus.</p>
<p>I asked about my two deposits, and was told I only made one, which had been spent (yes, much to my surprise, the "promotional" credit turned out to be "allegedly" my deposit).</p>
<p>Ultimately, I'm seeking help, as the support was useless. They changed the bonus terms and conditions, and they don't want to return my money, even though I played and reached close to 500-600 USD with my deposit (thus I actually wagered my own money).</p>
<p>I just want my money back, even if they only return my deposits.</p>
