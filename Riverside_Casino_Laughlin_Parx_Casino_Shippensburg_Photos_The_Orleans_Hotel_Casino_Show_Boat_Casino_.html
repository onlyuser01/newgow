<p>MGM Resorts International is one of the highest-ranked employers for military veterans, and the only casino operator to appear on MiltaryTimes’ “Best for Vets 2023 Employers” list.</p>

<p>Overall, the largest operator on the Las Vegas Strip placed 50th out of 230 firms in the rankings, and second behind only Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>The Best for Vets: Employers survey is recognized by the military community as the most trusted Veterans job ranking and has come to rely on these scores to aid in their transition to civilian life,” according to a statement issued by MGM. “Results are based on the policies and practices that make companies an attractive workplace for current employees and future job seekers within the military community.”</p>
<p>MGM is one of just two Nevada-based companies on the list, with Veterans Benefits Guide being the other. Las Vegas-based Veterans Benefits guide ranked 58th on the MilitaryTimes list and provides services to vets, including help navigating the Veterans Affairs Department’s often onerous claims process.</p>
<p>MGM, Gaming Industry Often Cater to Vets</p>
<p>The gaming industry, including MGM, has long prioritized hiring veterans and catering to those who have served.</p>
<p>“MGM Resorts takes pride in supporting military members and their families year-round. This includes actively recruiting and employing military men and women, and providing retention through professional development programs,” the Luxor operator added. “The Company fosters an inclusive culture for Veterans through its Employee Network Groups. MGM Resorts is a proud member of the Veteran Jobs Mission, a coalition of companies aiming to place one million U.S. military members and veterans into meaningful and rewarding careers.”</p>
<p>MGM is the largest private sector employer in Nevada, a state that’s home to nearly 207K military veterans. That ranks 29th out of the 50 states. More than 87K of the veterans living in Nevada served in the Korea or Vietnam Wars.</p>
<p>MGM ranks ahead of Southwest Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, and Home Depot on the MilitaryTimes list.</p>
<p>Good Reasons to Hire Veterans</p>
<p>Regardless of industry, companies have various reasons to hire those who served their countries. Several factors are highlighted in a 2016 24-page report by Syracuse University’s Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF).</p>
<p>Those include the ability of vets to transfer skills across various roles and tasks and their proficiency in technology. Veterans also work on teams and often thrive in frenetic work environments.</p>
<p>A highly applicable advantage in gaming is that veterans are viewed as trustworthy staffers. That’s an important trait in an industry where some employees handle large amounts of cash and customers’ personal data.</p>
