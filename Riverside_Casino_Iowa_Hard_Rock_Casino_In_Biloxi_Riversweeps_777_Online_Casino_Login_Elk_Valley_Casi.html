    <h1>Riverside Casino Iowa Hard Rock Casino In Biloxi Riversweeps 777 Online Casino Login Elk Valley Casi</h1>

<p>Hello dear guru team,</p>
<p>I'm in touch because the support and feedback from Playtoro is lousy.</p>
<p>I registered with the casino at the beginning of January and gambled a few things there. At some point I got the message that I could no longer make a deposit and should contact support. I then tried to contact the support in the chat. There it says that people usually get in touch after 4-5 minutes. After more than 12 hours I got the feedback I have to verify myself. There I then uploaded all the documents and found that there was no way to see his status. I then contacted the chat and asked for feedback. After 24 hours I got an answer... Documents are checked and I get an email when this is through. 4 days later I got 2 emails. Id be confirmed and address too. But nothing from my bank info... I only noticed it later. At the end of February I had another big win and thought I'd pay off this time. I then saw that my verification is still not through. I then saw that you wanted a payslip and uploaded it. After that I contacted the chat again. This took forever and I had to ask for an answer several times. The answer was that my Id was still missing.... I then informed them that I had received an email saying I had been checked. I then uploaded my ID and pay slip again and asked for feedback again. That took another 24 hours. Then the message came that he had viewed my documents and they looked ok to him and he forwarded this to the department to prioritize me. 2 hours later an email that my ID was already uploaded and I was checked. But still no feedback on the middle document. I then contacted the chat again and asked for my remaining documents to be processed. I also contacted support via email and asked them to process my documents. It has been over 36 hours since this message and no response from the casino. The documents have been there for ages and are simply not checked so that I can make a payment.</p>
<p>Please help me I don't know what else I can do.</p>
