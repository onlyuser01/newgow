<p>Superliga Argentina secures Genius Sports data deal</p>
<p>The company will target data piracy and focus on preserving sports integrity</p>
<p>Political shift in Argentina could narrow down the expansion prospects for the country’s sports betting industry</p>
<p>Genius Sports arrives in Argentina to secure the integrity and data of the country’s Superliga amid growing incidence of data piracy worldwide.</p>
<p>Genius Sports in Charge of Superliga Argentina Integrity</p>
<p>Genius Sports is breaking into a new market by providing the Superliga Argentina with much-needed official data and integrity solutions. The official partnership signed between the soccer body and the big data and betting company expert will help Superliga to guarantee the transparency of the competition and ensure its integrity.</p>
<p>To this end, Genius Sports will use its Integrity Services, a 24/7 platform that trawls big data and looks for aberrations between projections and results. The move will help Superliga protect itself against match-fixing and other forms of cheating.</p>
<p>A very proud day for Genius Sports' Latam operations, announcing our new integrity partnership with @Superliga to provide one of the largest leagues in world football with unprecedented protection against match-fixing &amp; betting-related corruption. https://t.co/0apkNL3FeH — Genius Sports (@GeniusSports) August 20, 2019</p>
<p>Commenting on the developments, Superliga Argentina president Mariano Elizondo had the following to say:</p>
<p>“Ensuring the transparency of our games is a fundamental priority for Superliga. We aim to guarantee all our teams with the same rules for every game, which is the main requirement for providing our fans and sponsors with the spectacle that they expect.”</p>
<p>Genius Sports will be in full control of the official league data, curating it for aberrations as well as combat data piracy – the instances in which unlicensed operators use the data without authorization to offer their own product.</p>
<p>So far as Genius Sports are concerned, the company’s Head of Commercial Partnerships for Latin America, Fernando Martinez had this to add:</p>
<p>“Argentinian football is at a critical stage of its growth with increased data quality and access to content driving major developments. This partnership with Superliga sets a precedent for leagues across LATAM to proactively safeguard the integrity and future of their competitions while controlling the collection, management and distribution of their real-time data.”</p>
<p>Genius Sports is spearheading in two markets – that of sports integrity as well as data privacy, a growing issue with rogue operators poaching data without having struck any deal with the curators of the data. In similar news, Genius Sports recently signed an integrity agreement with the German Football Association.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Prospects in Argentina</p>
<p>Meanwhile, election day is brewing in Argentina. The choice is between Frente de Todos, a party leaded by Alberto Fernandez who is given a good chance to replace the current President and gambling expansion supporter Mauricio Macri.</p>
<p>Should this happen, Argentina’s betting industry may take a back seat for a while. Meanwhile, Buenos Aires saw Governor Maria Eugenia Vidal step down from public office after she was defeated at the ballot box by Axel Kicillof.</p>
<p>Ms. Vidal was instrumental to the arrival of sports betting in Buenos Aires and with now being gone, any expansion efforts in the country look somewhat subdued.</p>
