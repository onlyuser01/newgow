    <h1>Winstar World Casino Horseshu Hotel Casino Detroit Casino Sky Casino Orion Casino Slots lv Casino Pl</h1>

<p>I have reported to slots lv on several occasions regarding the games not paying free spins. You will win the bonus but no spins and sometimes not even a cent in winnings. Today I was playing mystic wilds and was on my second set of free spins (which conveniently there is apparently no record of) the game locked up. I still had 2 spins remaining and had won $45 at that point. When I went back into the game my winnings were gone along with the free spins. I have contacted both chat and email support but they tell me they can give me a free chip with playthrough. I made a straight cash deposit as always and they want me to do playthrough when I had none so I requested a withdrawal but they say I can't withdraw til I play it more...I would have 60 to play with but since they took my winnings I only have 14. I love this casino and I hate this has happened but it's been happening more often than not and i still have yet to receive a response regarding my first complaint of games not paying free spins. Birds of Fury was the first. I will attach the screenshots of that. I will also attach a copy of my email with their support department. This will reflect the lack of concern displayed over this problem. I am so disappointed with them because I was a daily depositor with them and loved playing there but since this has been happening they offer no solution and keep taking my winnings. I can no longer do that and I did inform chat of my intentions. I truly hate they can't be on the up and up about this. Any help you can offer is greatly appreciated.
