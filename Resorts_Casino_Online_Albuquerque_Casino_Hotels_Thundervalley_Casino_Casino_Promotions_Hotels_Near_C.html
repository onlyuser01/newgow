<p>Kambi Group has unveiled a multi-channel sportsbook partnership with Bingoal, a Belgian online and retail gambling and betting operator. Under the deal, Bingoal will leverage Kambi’s market-leading Complete sportsbook across its retail and online business in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The deal will see Bingoal replace its current sportsbook provider with Kambi’s best-in-class sports betting technology and services. According to the announcement, the supplier’s Complete sportsbook will be integrated with Bingoal’s proprietary player account management system.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the Complete sportsbook will empower Bingoal’s online and offline business in Belgium and the Netherlands. As a result, Kambi’s unparalleled sportsbook will go live across 350 betting shops across Belgium.</p>
<p>In addition to its cutting-edge sportsbook, Kambi also offers a variety of innovative products and solutions, including its popular Bet Builder tool.</p>
<p>According to the official announcement, Bingoal, a company with over three decades of experience in the betting and gaming industry, selected Kambi as its new sportsbook provider because of its impressive track record with existing partners. For reference, Kambi already supplies such solutions to partners across Europe, including in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Bingoal’s new Kambi-powered sportsbook is expected to launch in Q2 2024.</p>

He said that his team cannot wait to integrate the company’s best-in-class sportsbook into its operations and fulfill its goals in the region where it operates.</p>
<p>Kambi’s sportsbook is known for its high level of performance and innovation, and we believe that the addition of its award-winning technology and services will be crucial as we look to fulfill our sportsbook ambitions in both Belgium and the Netherlands. Joeri Impens, CEO, Bingoal</p>
<p>Kristian Nylén, Kambi’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said that he is delighted to announce this partnership with Bingoal, which he lauded as an “established European operator with a strong brand and a legacy of industry success that spans more than three decades.”</p>
