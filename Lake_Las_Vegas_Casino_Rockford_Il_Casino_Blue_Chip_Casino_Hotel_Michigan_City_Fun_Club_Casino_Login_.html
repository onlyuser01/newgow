<p>Pragmatic Play’s The Dog House Dice and Snakes &amp; Ladders Megadice are now live with Peppermill Casino</p>
<p>A month after forming a digital and land-based alliance with Synot Games, Belgium’s Peppermill Casino announced an expansion of its partnership with Pragmatic Play, a leading provider of iGaming content.</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Pragmatic Play will power the Belgian operator with many games. As agreed, the provider’s full dice slots collection will be rolled out in Belgium, allowing Peppermill Casino to engage its players with exciting gaming experiences.</p>
<p>As per the deal, Pragmatic Play’s The Dog House Dice and Snakes &amp; Ladders Megadice are now live with Peppermill Casino, providing players with experiences inspired by popular games. Pragmatic Play’s dice slots are a fairly new addition to Pragmatic Play’s portfolio but already enjoy a lot of popularity.</p>
<p>Recently, the supplier struck a deal with Finland’s Veikkaus, further bolstering its European footprint. The company has a global presence, allowing players across the globe to enjoy its content. Boasting a robust pipeline, the supplier is constantly working on new additions to its portfolio. Some of its latest releases include 3 Buzzing Wilds and Hellvis Wild.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Reinforce Peppermill’s Offering</p>
<p>Representatives from the two firms commented on their expanded agreement with Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, sharing her excitement:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to expand our partnership with Peppermill Casino by bringing Pragmatic Play’s highly entertaining selection of dice slots to players in Belgium. Irina Cornides, COO, Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Cornides noted that Pragmatic Play’s dice slots “combine the excitement” of traditional slot games with the opportunity to score additional winning combinations and win more money.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Peppermill Casino’s general director, Anthony Rus, lauded Pragmatic Play as one of the best iGaming content providers in the world. Rus praised the supplier’s portfolio of “instantly recognizable games,” saying that his team is glad to introduce more of them to Peppermill Casino players.</p>
<p>We’re keen to introduce its range of dice slots to Peppermill Casino – our players have routinely embraced these titles and Pragmatic Play’s are an extremely exciting addition! Anthony Rus, general director, Peppermill Casino</p>
<p>Peppermill Casino is one of the newest iGaming operators in Belgium. The company focuses on dice games, slots and table games and is constantly looking to expand its library of content.</p>
<p>To that end, Peppermill Casinos continues to seek out the best games from industry-leading suppliers. In addition to its recent deal with Synot, Peppermill also minted partnerships with companies such as BF Games and Stakelogic.</p>
