<p>Vegas advanced to the Western Conference Finals with a 3-0 shutout of the San Jose Sharks on Sunday to win the best-of-seven series 4-2. The Golden Knights are amid nearly a week off before getting back on the ice this Saturday away at either Nashville or Winnipeg.</p>
<p>The Predators and Jets, the top two point earners during the regular season, will square off in an elimination game seven tonight in Nashville. The home team is favored at -150 to prevail and meet the Golden Knights.</p>
<p>The Eastern Conference Finals are already set, with the top seeds advancing for what should be a competitive and drama-filled series.</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Lightning and Washington Capitals will begin their series on Friday night in Florida. The home team is favored for game one at -185, and the series is at the same price.</p>
<p>A $100 bet and a Lightning win nets the gambler $54.05. The implied odds of Tampa Bay reaching the Stanley Cup Finals are 65 percent.</p>
<p>Golden Tickets</p>
<p>As for the Stanley Cup odds on which team will ultimately win the NHL title, the Westgate SuperBook has the Lightning the favorite at 7/4, or +175. The Golden Knights are next at 3/1.</p>
<p>Bettors late to the Golden Knight fever can still net $300 for every $100 wagered on a potential Vegas championship in the franchise’s debut campaign. Others, however, stand to collect much more.</p>
<p>Nevada casinos printed tickets on extremely long futures prior to the regular season on the Knights winning the Stanley Cup. Bettors have wagers on odds as long as 500/1, meaning just a $10 bet would net the fortunate gambler $5,000.</p>
<p>But before those slips can be cashed, Vegas first needs to get by either Nashville or Winnipeg. Both will be more than formidable foes.</p>
<p>West Schedule</p>
<p>Nashville and Winnipeg scored more points and won more games than Vegas during the regular season. Whichever team succeeds to the West Finals, the Golden Knights will certainly have their work cut out for them.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, the SuperBook has Vegas’ odds at 11/10 of advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals. Nashville posts at 19/10, and Winnipeg at 14/5.</p>
<p>Games one and two will be played in either Nashville or Winnipeg. NHL Playoffs dictate home ice in the conference finals and Stanley Cup Final based on which team had the better regular season record.</p>
<p>Games three and four will move to T-Mobile Arena near the Las Vegas Strip, with tentative games five through seven alternating between cities.</p>
<p>As to which team Gerard Gallant would prefer to face, the Vegas coach told reporters recently, “We’re focusing on ourselves. Once we know who we’re playing, we’ll shift our attention to that team.”</p>
<p>A limited number of playoff tickets went on sale today at www.vegasgoldenknights.com. Prices range from $225 to $800, plus fees.</p>
