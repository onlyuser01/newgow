    <h1>Avi Resort Casino Laughlin Casino Italy Free Codes For Chumba Casino New Casino Mohegan Sun Casino C</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Preaty pls sry for what i'm writing down here, and pls help me, but believe me that i'm tired of explaning all the time to this site to the suport the situation, again and again, and without a real respons from them, only recieving learned lines from them.</p>
<p>I have to tell u that i have allmost 1 year and 3 mounths in Austria and 11 mounths in our own rent with my fiance.</p>
<p>I've made some windraws, since 21.01.23(270E), 22.01.23(100E) and 31.02.23(20E) i've made a total of 3 withdraws and i never got payed, and my fiance made in the date of 01.02.23 one of 230E and he also didn't got payed.</p>
<p>First this site asked, in the date of 24.01.23, for the documents so we can proof our identity, and habitation.</p>
<p>And i've replied to that mail and send them the documents that they asked for with extra documents that proof that we have a Austrian Ecard also. They never respond to that email, so i got in touch with the suport online so i can see what happend, and they told me to send again the documents, and i've send them again, i have to say that they wanted JPG not PDF, and i made some pictures on our scaned documents.</p>
<p>After this, i contacted the suport to see if they recieved they mail and they told me yes and will send it on.</p>
<p>After 1 or 2 days i recieved again a mail where they are saying that they want JPG not PDF, and i've send them again JPGs of the scaned documents (they were JPG not PDF).</p>
<p>After 1-2 days again they told me that they don't want scaned but JPGs, then i made some pictures with my phone on all of the documents, and i've send them the pictures where it's clear that my hand is bloking the light and can be seen in the pictures.</p>
<p>Then after every 1-2 days they replayed the same that they want JPG not PDF.</p>
<p>Seriously like 6 or 7 times at least, and they were still asking me for the same papers that they allready have, then i made another set of photos for the documents and send them those, in a new email.</p>
<p>And this was after i replied 6 or 7 to the mails that they wer asking with papers again and again and again.</p>
<p>After like almost 1 week, since i've send the new photos, they started to as for "another photo of your ID", it's like they can't see that they have a photo of my id and my fiances id with a coffee, watch and a pack of cigarettes next to it, and very clear and readable.</p>
<p>As i can see it's a fraud site or a scam site, cuz all the time they come with excusions for paying what i've won, but when i deposid they are taking the money from the same card that they need to charge with the winninings, and it's the same for me and my fiance.</p>
<p>I understand they need to verify that we are ok, but seriosly they have ALL THE PAPERS in JPG formats and they are still not paying.</p>
<p>I can say now after 3 weeks that I have a real problem with this casino, thay are with out the capability of looking and reading some pictures.</p>
<p>As u can see in the proof i've attcached i've send them all the papers in JPG formats, and they were still saying that they want JPG not scaned papers, and now they are saying thay they want photos form ID cards, that they allready have.</p>
<p>And btw they banned me from a game also, and only me, if i'm playing from my fiance id is working only on my id is banned, thinking i was on 13 free spins with a big win going on, and on the 10 spin the game just got bloked.</p>
<p>And now in the date of 06.02.23 they banned my fiance account and told him that he has duplicated an account, if u need i can send u the mail of my fiance and the username so u can check.</p>
<p>Serioasly we just want our winnigs, mine of 390E and my fiances 230E.</p>
<p>And so u know i have also conversations with the online support and all the pictures i've sent you were raised because they were to big to upload, and if u want i can forward all the mails that i've send them and also 2 of the conversations that i had with the online suport, with no real respons.</p>
