<p>Table Trac has received a Mississippi license to install its gaming management equipment in state casinos</p>
<p>The 1995-launched company that designs, manufactures, and sells casino information and management systems has been granted a new license by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>This way, the Magnolia state has joined six other US states where Table Trac has received a gaming license to provide its solutions to interested operators. The list includes Nevada, Iowa, Maryland, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and South Dakota.</p>
<p>Table Trac, Proud to Receive a Unanimous Vote</p>
<p>The company has expressed its pride to receive the recommendation from the agency responsible for maintaining the integrity of the state and the public confidence in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>The green light was given unanimously, at the end of the monthly commission meeting organized by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>The decision will allow Table Trac to this way expand its foothold in the US by installing its expert system in gambling facilities around the state.</p>
<p>Table Trac, Ready to Supply “New and Valuable” Choices</p>
<p>According to chief executive officer and president Chad Hoehn, the freshly licensed manufacturer and distributor of casino information and gaming management systems in the state is looking forward to providing casino operators with their “new and valuable choice” consisting of their top products.</p>
<p>The list includes options like MobileTrac, PromoTrac, DataTrac, KioskTrac, TableTrac, and their top-tier CasinoTrac product.</p>
<p>Table Trac’s CasinoTrac management systems are already being used by more than 100 gaming operators in over 270 sites spread in Australia, the Caribbean, North, South, and Central parts of America.</p>
<p>The system processes millions of transactions on a daily basis at 150+ global casinos, providing a series of comprehensive insights regarding all levels of casino operations including promotions, accounting, revenue audits, and Players’ Clubs.</p>
<p>Other advantages of this management system with full functionality refer to the large number of available features that do not require operators to purchase any modules, along with the included upgrades free of charge, built-in generator of reward offers and hourly auto tiering algorithms, simple maintenance, user-friendly interface, intelligent dispatch system, and more.</p>
<p>The company that established itself as one of the leading go-to suppliers of casino management platforms continues to help prominent properties enhance their connections with visitors and customers alike.</p>
<p>Last October, Havasu Landing Resort &amp; Casino in California chose Table Trac’s CasinoTrac network as the provider of its casino management systems. In November 2022, Table Trac announced it would deploy its Casino management system with Golden Buffalo Casino &amp; Motel in South Dakota.</p>
