<p>Dear Sefedin25,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the responsible gambling and I found this:</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion:</p>
<p>In case You are diagnosed with a gambling addiction or try to stay away from gambling for a different reason, we want to assist you to stay away from anything, that does nothing good for you. "Self-Exclusion" means, that You exclude yourself, out of Your own choice, from all gambling services. This exclusion cannot be undone for a set amount of time. If you wish to self-exclude yourself from gambling, please message our support and give them a time span between 6 months and 5 years. They also will explain to you all the future steps and what is needed from you.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that Self Exclusion is permanent for the set time span and will not be undone for your own protection. During Self Exclusion you are not allowed to create a new Account and every attempt to create a new Account during Self Exclusion is a violation of our Terms of Service and may result in the permanent ban of your original account. Please refer to: https://www.gamblingtherapy.org/ for gambling help"</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that you requested self-exclusion and the casino blocked your account, but it was reopened later?</p>
<p>Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’s closure? My email address is kristina.s@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
