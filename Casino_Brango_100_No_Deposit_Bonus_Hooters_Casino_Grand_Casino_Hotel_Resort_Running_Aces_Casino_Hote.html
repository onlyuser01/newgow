<p>The Kindred Group has much to be happy about as the company has continued to tackle one of the most difficult metrics in its revenue book – the money that comes in from harmful gambling. The latest quarterly report covering the first three months of 2023 saw another improvement for the Group with regard to its dependency on harmful gambling.</p>
<p>The share of gross winnings revenue from high-risk players dropped down to 3.0% from 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, reaffirming the Group’s ongoing commitment to tackling the important metric. Kindred also reported an improvement effect after interventions at 83%, demonstrating the firm’s multi-pronged approach to taking care of its customers and guiding them on a path to safety when it comes to gambling online.</p>
<p>Kindred acknowledges that the quarterly improvement is still small but argues that the most recent efforts are a testament to the importance of proactive operators that intervene and seek to help and understand their customers. Kindred Group CEO Henrik Tjärnström welcomed the opportunity to see his company continue to address the issue.</p>
<p>He emphasized the importance of detecting and engaging with customers who are showing markers of harm, the term that is used by the industry to flag players who may be engaging in harmful gaming behavior. Tjärnström was happy to see that the efforts have been paying off.</p>
<p>In terms of improvement effect after interventions, this was the best quarter since Q3 2022. The executive spoke about how important it is to have early intervention in order to prevent harmful behaviors later on.</p>
<p>"Going forward I look forward to following the holistic approach and collaboration across different teams within Kindred," he noted. All of these efforts are encompassed by Kindred Group’s Journey towards Zero mission which is a dedicated effort by the company to bring the revenue generated from harmful gambling practices to a net zero.</p>
<p>Tackling those remaining percentage points has proven difficult, but success would present the entire industry with a roadmap to follow in eliminating gambling-related harm from their operations and helping businesses and customers globally.</p>
<p>Problem gambling and eliminating gambling-related harm has been a priority for Casino Guru as well. To this end, Casino Guru recently partnered with the City, University of London, a leading British university, "to help identify best practices in online gambling self-exclusion and recommend a set of standards for adoption across different jurisdictions."</p>
