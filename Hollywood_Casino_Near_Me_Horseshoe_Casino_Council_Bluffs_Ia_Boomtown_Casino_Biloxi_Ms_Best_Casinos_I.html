    <h1>Hollywood Casino Near Me Horseshoe Casino Council Bluffs Ia Boomtown Casino Biloxi Ms Best Casinos I</h1>

<p>I spend far more time finding and researching a casino than I do actually playing at it (I have really bad luck ðŸ¤£)</p>
<p>Most of the things I come across are minor details. Things like an expired bonus, wrong payment information, etc.</p>
<p>Every now and then, though, I'll find better stuff like casinos that operate without a license. Personally, I think every review on Casino Guru should have the important information displayed at the very top of the screen. URL, parent company, license number and RTP range should be the first thing people see instead of having to click on "show company details", and any casino operating without a license should have that very obviously displayed so people can make informed decisions.</p>
<p>I know that the bonuses are the reason most people start using this site, but it's the real reviews and in-depth information that has kept me coming back.</p>
<p>I'll do my part to pass on whatever limited knowledge I've gained. If I can help prevent even just one person from having to experience the sickening feeling of having their hard-earned (and for some people very needed) money confiscated by a shady casino, then I'll consider that my good deed for the year ðŸ¤£</p>
