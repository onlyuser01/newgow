<p>PressEnter Group, a mobile-first-oriented iGaming company, has launched its Ultra Casino brand in Peru and Chile, greatly reinforcing its presence in South America.</p>
<p>PressEnter Expands Its Reach to the LATAM Region</p>
<p>By targeting those two crucial markets, the company hopes to establish itself as one of the powerhouses in the Latin American region. The budding LATAM markets have been highly appealing to numerous gambling companies thanks to the region’s quick growth. PressEnter is no different and has named Latin America one of its primary targets for expansion. The company hopes to launch Ultra Casino in a few other LATAM countries within a year.</p>
<p>The company is known for its premium gambling products, with Ultra Casino being one of its most renowned subsidiaries. The betting platform offers unparalleled experiences thanks to its user-friendly design, stylish look, gamified content, and premium offerings. Last but not least, the Ultra Charge loyalty program is one of the key selling points of Ultra Casino, offering regular bettors the chance to earn personalized rewards.</p>
<p>The Company Is Sure Bettors Are Going to Enjoy Its Offerings</p>
<p>David Plumi, PressEnter Group’s regional managing director for Spain and LATAM, spoke on the move, declaring that the Peru and Chile launch is a “milestone moment” for the company. The launch in Latin America is a core strategy for PressEnter’s future and Plumi is delighted to see Ultra Casino successfully launched on that market.</p>
<p>Plumi emphasized that Ultra Casino offers supreme gambling experiences that appeal to a great variety of bettors. He listed some of the operator’s strong sides, including its diverse selection of titles, a large variety of payment options, and the innovative loyalty club reward system which rewards users for their dedication with tailored bonuses and prizes.</p>
<p>The managing director added that he is convinced that the Peruvian and Chilean bettors have not experienced anything quite like Ultra Casino before. Therefore, the operator’s mission is not only to meet the expectations of local punters but also to far exceed them.</p>
<p>Plumi concluded by reasserting the importance of the LATAM markets and the company’s plans for launching in additional South American jurisdictions as well. However, that will happen only after the company has set up and begun its operations in Peru and Chile.</p>
<p>PressEnter Group recently reinforced its core team by appointing experienced workers to its leadership teams. Qurban Hussain became the company’s chief financial officer around the end of January, which was followed by the appointment of Hampus Eriksson as a chief product officer.</p>
