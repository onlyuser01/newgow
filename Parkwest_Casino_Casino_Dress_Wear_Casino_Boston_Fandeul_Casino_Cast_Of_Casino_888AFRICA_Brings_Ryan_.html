    <h1>Parkwest Casino Casino Dress Wear Casino Boston Fandeul Casino Cast Of Casino 888AFRICA Brings Ryan</h1>

<p>As Africa becomes an increasingly attractive place for gaming and betting companies, more of the big industry names are making serious efforts to consolidate their footprint in the region. 888AFRICA has done so by appointing Ryan Newton as its vice president of the VIP segment.</p>
<p>Newton’s Extensive Range Well Placed in 888AFRICA</p>
<p>Newton comes from an extensive industry background and has served a similar stint as VIP lead for Betsson Group. He announced his appointment in a LinkedIn post:</p>
<p>“I’m delighted to share that I’m starting a new position as VP of VIP at 888AFRICA! Let’s get to it.” 888AFRICA VIP lead Ryan Newton</p>
<p>Now, he will be coming to reinforce 888AFRICA’s efforts in cultivating a high value-added customer base in some of the fastest developing markets in the region. Newton is also a well-seasoned veteran in the industry and he has focused the better part of his career on cultivating VIP customers across numerous regions.</p>
<p>While he will serve as head of VIP for Africa, he has similarly worked as a lead for other regions, including the United Kingdom, Europe, and Latin America to name a few. He worked for BetEasy in Australia between 2014 and 2018 as per his LinkedIn profile and the man was part of Flutter Entertainment’s Sportsbet team when he was only getting started with the industry.</p>
<p>888AFRICA is led by CEO Christopher Coyne who used to work for The Stars Group and who worked with Newton in Goat Interactive. Newton is in fact joining 888AFRICA from Goat. Meanwhile, the company has been able to cultivate a remarkable talent lineup with other prominent industry names now serving various roles.</p>
<p>Alex Rutherford, an ex-William Hill CPO is part of the company’s ongoing efforts. In order to use the 888 brand name, the company is paying a licensing fee to 888 Holdings. 888AFRICA is focusing on regulated markets in Africa only. The platform though will not be developed by 888 but by a third party that specializes in the provision of full-stack solutions for gambling companies. The company has not been mentioned by name.</p>
<p>The venture features other gambling industry veterans, including Helen Scott-Allen, Ian Marmion, and Andrew Lee.</p>
