    <h1>Chumash Casino Resort Ameristar Casino Black Hawk Reno Casino 10 Jili Casino Winstar Casino In Oklah</h1>

<p>I have made 3 withdrawal requests in total all been rejected.</p>
<p>1st request - was told that they need POI &amp; POA - I provided proof of my passport and utility bill which proves who I am and where I live. This was verified by the team and requested to make a new withdrawal request.</p>
<p>2nd Request - was told even though documents have been verified they now need proof of the cards I deposited from to make sure they are mine… okay so I provided 3/4 pictures of the cards individually and also me holding these cards along with my passport to provide they are mine and active… they verified these cards and asked me to request a new withdrawl.</p>
<p>3rd Request - rejected again and stating they do not carry out withdrawls to National Westminister cards (NatWest)… I was fuming as they are happy to accept deposits from these cards which in fact are all Mastercards which is apart of there policy and what they accept… but they cannot withdraw to that card but yet happy to accept deposits from the same payment method??? In response they said use a different payment method or open a new card which is not NatWest? Or bitcoin wallet lol? I was gobsmacked as they did not answer my questions or provide any justification on this matter as I stated I am not opening any new bank accounts to get another card which they cannot provide any clarification on… and I do not use or trust bitcoin. They are happy to take my money but not give me my money back which is in excess of £400.</p>
<p>im confused what to do as I just don’t see them paying me my money and think is best just to blow that £400 on slots and close the account down or fight a battle which I have no control over. Please help if you can.</p>
