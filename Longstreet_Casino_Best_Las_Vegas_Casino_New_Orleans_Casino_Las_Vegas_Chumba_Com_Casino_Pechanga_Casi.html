<p>Alright, so let's see. Do you confirm that none of these messages are considered an exlusion request?</p>
<p>Me: However, I am spending way too much time on this so I'd like to block my account permanently. Thanks for your understanding!</p>
<p>Them: I totally understand you. However, there is no need to rush your account because you can control your gambling activity by yourself. Isn't it?</p>
<p>Let me know</p>
<p>Me: Come on, you know how it is ðŸ¤£ Please just block it permanently.</p>
<p>Them: Alexandros, I can set cooling-off periods for you, and it will be an alternative for you. Deal?</p>
<p>Me: No, I'd like to get permanently blocked. I am just losing money and time.</p>
<p>Them: I value YOU as my player and want to make your gambling activity comfortable. If you want to quit it - I totally understand it. I'll close your account on 24 hours due to further account closure procedure. Then, I'll contact you tomorrow in order to receive your final decision. Hope for your understanding.</p>
<p>(Day passes and I am asked for my decision)</p>
<p>Me: Please block my account permanently. I will not accept anything else other than a complete permanent block. If you don't do it, I will seek help from the authorities of Curacao. Thanks!</p>
<p>Them: Got it! So, if you change your mind or need any assistance, just let me know here!</p>
<p>Me: But how can I change my mind if it's a PERMANENT block? I suppose that the definition of a permanent block is that it cannot be reversed.</p>
<p>Them: I understand the definition, but sometimes mind can change in a minute</p>
<p>Me: No, you didn't not understand. I am asking if there is any irreversible block that can be applied to my account.</p>
<p>Now I'd like to add something more. When I asked them to unblock the account, they made me fill in a template that was askingme to fill the "reason for self-exclusion" that did apply to me. This can only mean that they were considering my status as self exclusion, no?</p>
