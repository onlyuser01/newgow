    <h1>Ruidoso Casino Casino For 18 Year Olds Near Me Real Casino Slots Online Fortune Casino Login Bovada</h1>

<p>I need to receive 11,500.00 EUR, this is including the 2 processed but missing withdrawals of 500 euros each.</p>
<p>What will be the next excuse for not having to pay me? Or are they are now gonna be fair and pay the account balance, including the missing withdrawals.</p>
<p>5) asked after the weekend if the problem was resolved, later that day account closed, and blocked from live chat.</p>
<p>4) technical work will be done after the weekend,</p>
<p>3) all payments are being checked by security service ( to check where the 2 missing withdrawals of 500 euros are? )</p>
<p>2) wait 7 working days for a answer from the relevant department to see if I can use another withdrawal method,</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget the security checks. That was also a thing, suddenly.</p>
<p>I would appreciate that, maybe they have forgotten that they are licensed?</p>
<p>But let's wait, they are licensed. Maybe they will sort this all out, and everything will be fixed. And after all, that they will pay me as they promised for at least two weeks everyday.</p>
<p>Of course, they do also not reply on emails when I do sent them now. But maybe they will, email has been sent, multiple.</p>
<p>They do also say that I do need to sent a email, to appeal their decision ( which decision exactly? Not wanting to pay the fair winnings? ) but they have never replied on a email in the past.</p>
<p>They can still correct this, and pay me. As it should, and as they promised.</p>
<p>They just don't want to pay me the winnings.</p>
<p>Of course not true, there is no fraud, everyone does see their real intention now.</p>
<p>But after all, when I did not lose the balance where they hoped for that I would lose, they suddenly they accused me of fraud. No further information, account closed, blocked on live chat.</p>
<p>I had also asked, if there is a problem with MasterCard withdrawals if I also can withdraw my funds to BTC? They said one time I could, and that they will follow up with the relevant department. But never heard anything about that anymore. Also, suddenly I needed to wait 7 working days on an answer from the relevant department, to see if I'm able to withdraw the funds to BTC. They literally try everything to delay, or not having to pay me.</p>
<p>I do have already two excuses, 1) technical work/problem to be able to withdraw ( can be true, but very coincidental because that happend suddenly after making a big win on Gates of Olympus ). Before there were 0 problems.</p>
<p>Until 9 August, when I asked them again about the withdrawals. They closed the account later that day, and blocked me everywhere.</p>
<p>They promised a lot, I would receive everything. Also the 2 processed, but missing withdrawals.</p>
<p>Technical work would be done in the week 7th to 11th August 2023, so I could withdraw the funds.</p>
<p>Technical work/problems, that was the first excuse. But they kept saying every day that I would receive all funds, and that I can expect them as the technical work/ problem would be fixed/ done.</p>
<p>They hoped that I would lose the account balance, in that delay time, when that was not the case the next excuse came up, and that was in this case ''fraud''.</p>
<p>They delayed the withdrawal so much, but when I did not touched the funds... They did just closed my account with another excuse, ''fraud''. But that fraud excuse came up, after I have asked for an update regarding the technical problem which they promised to be fixed that week.</p>
<p>They also followed up with the relevant department, but I would really receive everything. But I needed to wait for the technical work to be done.</p>
<p>They have told me for at least 2 weeks, everyday, that I would receive all funds, and that I can expect them.</p>
<p>I do get blocked from the live chat, when I do ask something about the withdrawals and my funds.</p>
<p>I don't think they will reply, they do also not reply on my emails (also not when the account was still openend). But let's hope on the best, and that they will reply, just be fair and pay me accordingly.</p>
