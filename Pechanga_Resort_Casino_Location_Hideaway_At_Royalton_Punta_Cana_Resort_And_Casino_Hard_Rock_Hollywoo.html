    <h1>Pechanga Resort Casino Location Hideaway At Royalton Punta Cana Resort And Casino Hard Rock Hollywoo</h1>

<p>¡Ay, caramba! NeoGames S.A. subsidiary Wizard Games is back with a new spicy and Mexican-themed slot experience which will elevate your mood and let you dip a toe in the exciting world of the Mexican fiesta with the 50-moneyline Grand Pepper Party slot.</p>
<p>The slot comes with a number of exciting features that will keep you immersed in this cascade of sound, color, and feature, where a Grand Wild will expand from 1x1 on the grid to a 4x4 on the grid and give you a nice boost to your chances of winning.</p>
<p>To make the title thematic, Wizard Games has used the usual iconography that is relatable to fiestas, introducing tacos, margaritas, and other familiar symbols. The game naturally features a free spins bonus level that will be triggered through the scatter symbols, where you will find a Roaming Wild, which moves across the reels and changes up the potential to win with every spin of the bonus round.</p>
<p>If you get another three Scatter Symbols in the bonus level, beware! You will get 3 more extra Free Spins added to the current level, and a Roaming Wild in the right place could lead to a very juicy 5,000x payday.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new launch, Wizard Games Managing Director Benedict McDonagh said that the studio was excited to be adding this new game to the list of more than 150 similar titles.</p>
<p>Grand Pepper Party adds some real spice to our games portfolio, with our latest hit focused on a raucous fiesta with a tasty max win of 5,000x," McDonagh said, speaking highly of the new game and its unique theme and gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>Wizard Games has been on a hiring spree with the company consolidating its management team. Recently, Megan Easey joined as Director of Operations. McDonagh himself is also a recent hire, as the man joined earlier in the year as well.</p>
<p>The company has also been preparing for a different type of festive season with Christmas fast approaching and Wizard Games lining up its holiday-themed games, including Jingle Wins, Santa’s Fortune, Santa Bonanza, and Mystery Fox Christmas Party, among others.</p>
<p>Wizard Games has continued to push a good development pace this year with titles such as Golden’s Elk and a successful partnership with Rush Street Interactive, facilitated through Pariplay, and enabling the supplier to deploy its products in Pennsylvania, the United States.</p>
