<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>Hi George, any news?</p>
<p>I got a few minutes ago again the same mail with the same reaction, that the claim is final denied by scatters.</p>
<p>"We are contacting you from our Player Protection Team due to your recent contact with our Customer Support Team regarding a refund request on your Scatters Casino account for €200.00.</p>
<p>You have requested to be banned across our license on Cashimashi Casino on 10/03/2020. The deposits you've made on Scatters were made prior to the date mentioned before.</p>
<p>Due to the mentioned above, please be informed that we have closed our investigation. As a result, we will not be able to refund the deposits as requested.</p>
<p>We have Permanently Self Excluded your new Scatters Casino account to follow our Social Responsibilities and ensure our Player Protection.</p>
<p>We would also ask you to refrain from attempting to open any other accounts as this may result in forfeiture of any funds deposited or gambled.</p>
<p>If you feel you need assistance with gambling, we would like to recommend visiting the following pages and seeking advice from these independent organizations:</p>
<p>https://www.gamcare.org.uk/</p>
<p>https://www.begambleaware.org/</p>
<p>https://www.gamblersanonymous.org/ga/</p>
<p>Our decision is considered final and hence, this matter to be closed from our side.</p>
<p>We know this may not be the answer you hoped for. However, if you are not satisfied with our resolution, you may refer the matter for adjudication by an ADR, EADR Ltd., European Alternative Dispute Resolution (‘EADR’) is an independent arbitration with their main office at 189/1, The Strand, Gzira GZR 1024, Malta, providing alternative dispute resolution and is designed to comply with the "Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution (General) Regulations" (S.L.378.18) in Malta. In gaming disputes, the MGA Alternative Dispute Resolution Directive 2018 applies in addition you may fill out an Online Dispute Form via https://eadr.org/ or via email at info@eadr.org"</p>
<p>Again, I absolutely don't understand that decision, since I delivered a proof screenshot from crazeplay casino (same licence MGA/B2C/295/2015) support, that my account there was closed due to gambling issues on 11.10.2019. This was in German, here is a translation from the relevant screenshot part:</p>
<p>"Crazeplay: Your account closure and last deposit was on 11.10.2019.</p>
<p>Me: Did I gave an reason for the account closure?</p>
<p>Crazeplay: As I can see, the account got closed due to gambling issues.</p>
<p>Me: On 11.10.2019?</p>
<p>Crazeplay: Yes, correct."</p>
<p>So the reason delivered by your casino, that the licence as aware of it on 10.03.2020, is proven wrong. I hope you overthink this decision, since it is obviously proven wrong and Refund all nettlosses after 11.10.2019.</p>
<p>Scatters did not follow to the MGA Player Protection Directive (2018) - Part IV - Responsible Gaming:</p>
<p>"Provided further that, in the event that a player has been excluded by the B2C Licensee in light of sufficient reasons which indicate that the player may have problemg ambling issues, that player shall be excluded across all brands operated by the B2Cl icensee."</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your final response.</p>
