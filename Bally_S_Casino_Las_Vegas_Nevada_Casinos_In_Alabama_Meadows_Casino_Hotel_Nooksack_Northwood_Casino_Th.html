<p>Entain finalized the acquisition of esports betting and gaming platform Unikrn in October last year. Since then, the entertainment giant has been looking to develop an innovative esports platform, and the latest move includes the appointment of Brian Lancey as the company’s new chief marketing officer or CMO.</p>
<p>The Right Marketing Executive at the Right Time</p>
<p>Lancey is well-versed in esports and he will help Entain make full good use of one of the company’s strongest assets in the space. Entain fully owns Unikrn along with its technology, platform, and brand, giving the entertainment giant a jumpstart in the industry.</p>
<p>Unikrn has developed some innovative gaming products, including UMode, a bet-on-one’s self mode whereby players make stakes on how far in a video game they can get and whether they can achieve certain milestones. If successful, payment is released.</p>
<p>Lancey will now seek to bolster the marketing side of things and popularize the Unikrn brand name with the desired target audiences. Prior to joining Entain and Unikrn, Lancey was part of MasterCard’s team, serving as VP for global sponsorships and consumer marketing. He also held a stint with Brand Synergy Group.</p>
<p>Lancey commented on his transition to his new position in a LinkedIn post in which he confirmed the appointment and praised Entain’s accomplishments over the past several years:</p>
<p>“Entain, a global leader in betting, gaming, and interactive entrainment, is paving the way for the future of the industry. I look forward to building the esports business with the incredible team and inspiring leadership.” Entain’s Unirkn CMO Brian Lancey</p>
<p>Unikrn’s Return Highly Anticipated</p>
<p>Unikrn is currently reworking its brand identity and a quick visit to the website informs readers that maintenance is ongoing. The company has not specified the date of its return, but Lancey’s addition to its marketing team is a tell-tale sign that the relaunch is planned for sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Entain will lend many of its own esports, tech, and innovation products to Unikrn and help it reclaim the esports betting space with a bang. “We’ll be joining major brands such as Ladbrokes and bwin, in a move that will bring you an unprecedented number of new esports &amp; gaming experiences,” the company message reassures eager fans.</p>
