    <h1>Harrahs Casino Nj St Charles Casino Casino Site Angel Of Winds Casino Plaza Hotel Casino Hampus Erik</h1>

<p>As the year begins, so do changes. PressEnter Group, the company behind a portfolio of well-establishing gaming brands such as Ultra Casino, 21, JustSpin, Nitro Casino, XLBet, and others, has announced the appointment of Hampus Eriksson as Deputy CEO, with the gaming giant preparing for a year of rapid growth and expansion. The news was originally shared via a press release seen by Casino Guru News. This move comes not so long after the appointment of Philip Bell as Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
<p>Although he will also serve as Deputy CEO, Eriksson will continue to occupy his main position as Chief Product Officer where he has proven his commitment to the company through the development of a dedicated product strategy.</p>
<p>Thanks to Eriksson’s unflagging efforts, PressEnter Group has been able to build a strong proposition, allowing it to swiftly expand some of its flagship brands in key and coveted jurisdictions. Under his watch, XLBet has been able to expand into both Ontario and Romania, but the company’s NitroCasino brand was also able to secure an entry into the Canadian province as well.</p>
<p>Eriksson’s mix of experience and proven track record will allow him to have a bigger say in the company’s day-to-day, and also stay close to the changes throughout the company as they unfold. He will offer further guidance and strategic input to help steer the entire company in 2024 and lead to what is hopefully stronger results across the board.</p>
<p>This appointment was naturally welcomed across the board within the company. PressEnter Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Lahcene Merzoug, has confirmed that Eriksson would make a prominent addition and the appointment is indeed a reward for his hard work. Merzoug though will also have more free time to focus on other areas knowing that Eriksson would be able to tend after certain aspects of business.</p>
<p>"I have worked with Hampus for more than ten years. He is a highly experienced executive and product specialist and knows exactly how to run a business that is as effective as it is efficient. Through his bold leadership and natural talent, I am confident that we will continue to progress at pace over the months ahead," Merzoug noted.</p>
<p>For his part, Eriksson was similarly pleased with the appointment, and he thanked for the chance to further PressEnter Group’s efforts into building a recognizable and strong offer in the gaming and betting verticals. He assured that he will continue to work hard to meet his objectives and the company’s goals as part of the C-Suite and deliver the expected results.</p>
<p>"I am thrilled to have been promoted to the role of Deputy CEO and look forward to working alongside Lahcene to lead this organization to the greatness I know it can achieve," Eriksson noted.</p>
