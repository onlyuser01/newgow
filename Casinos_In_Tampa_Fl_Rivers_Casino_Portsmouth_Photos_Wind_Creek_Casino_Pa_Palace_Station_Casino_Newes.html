<p>Sports technology firm TAPPP announced this week a multi-year national agreement with Major League Rugby (MLR) and The Rugby Network (TRN).</p>
<p>On-Screen Betting Experience</p>
<p>The agreement will introduce a first-of-its-kind technology developed by TAPPP and pending patent that will allow fans of rugby in the US to utilize TRN for a curated, seamless, and uninterrupted live, on-screen betting experience.</p>
<p>“We are always looking for innovative ways to continue to grow new audiences and keep current fans more deeply engaged throughout the entire season and TAPPP’s technology will help us do exactly that. We’re excited about the future with TAPPP as we usher in a new era of interactivity with MLR fans.” George Killebrew, Commissioner, MLR</p>
<p>In a level of innovation unseen to date in the US sports betting scene, TAPPP’s interactive transaction portal will allow sports fans during live matches to engage directly with enhanced content and showcase their knowledge of the sport while cheering for potentially lucrative outcomes. The technology will be available during all TRN live-streamed MLR matches until the end of the season.</p>
<p>Excited about the new partnership with the MLR and TRN, TAPPP founder and chief executive officer Sandy Agarwal, stated that “the synergies between TAPPP and the MLR make this the perfect opportunity to launch our revolutionary new product.”</p>
<p>“We believe rugby fans will have a lot of fun using the TAPPP Portal and will soon feel even more connected to the teams and players they love and to the great game of rugby.” Sandy Agarwal, Founder and CEO, TAPPP</p>
<p>The TAPPP Portal will allow eligible viewers in approved states to place match-specific, real-time bets with licensed sports betting local operators, while all US residents will have the opportunity to participate in a dynamic, free-to-play game featuring real-time predictions on game outcomes to test their knowledge of the sport. The portal is expected to initially be available to residents in New Jersey who wager via the PlayUp sportsbook.</p>
<p>The portal will also allow MLR and TRN to enhance live-match experiences, increase match viewership and entice new rugby fans.</p>
<p>Series B Funding Round Raised $10 Million</p>
<p>The partnership with MLR and TRN followed shortly after TAPPP concluded a Series B funding round to raise $10 million in new investment and support its in-game betting product which allows viewers to bet on sporting events via televisions and streaming platforms.</p>
<p>TAPPP already raised $11 million in a Series A funding round in 2018 and used the funds to launch innovative payment products with both the MLB and NFL, as well as build the technology and user interface for the interactive gaming and betting transaction portal available to viewers during live sports broadcasts.</p>
