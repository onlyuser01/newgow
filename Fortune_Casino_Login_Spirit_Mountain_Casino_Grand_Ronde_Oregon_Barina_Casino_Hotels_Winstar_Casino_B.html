<p>Leading payments platform provider Paysafe announced today it expanded operations into the recently launched mobile sports betting market in New York to further strengthen its position in payments and affiliate marketing across North America.</p>
<p>“Payments and affiliate marketing play essential roles in customer conversion and the growth of iGaming brands and the wider market.” Zak Cutler, CEO, North America iGaming, Paysafe</p>
<p>The announcement made by the NYSE-listed Paysafe that it entered the iGaming market in New York continued the trend of strong growth the company registered throughout 2021 across the US and Canada.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to have supported the ongoing expansion of the North American online gaming space in 2021 through 2022, with our recent entry into New York – a pivotal market that will hopefully galvanize broader U.S. state and Canadian provincial regulation.” Zak Cutler, CEO, North America iGaming, Paysafe</p>
<p>The move into the newly-launched market in New York is the latest for the payments provider under the leadership of recently appointed as chief executive officer for iGaming across North America Cutler, who was chosen to deliver on the company’s growth strategy.</p>
<p>Seeking to become the leader in the payments processing space and continue to benefit from the rapidly expanding iGaming markets in North America, Paysafe is currently active across 18 states plus Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>2021 Significant Developments</p>
<p>Several of the company’s existing partners among which FOX Bet, Golden Nugget Online Gaming and PointsBet, expanded payment agreements into other states, while Fubo Sportsbook, PlayUp, SuperBook Sports and WynnBET joined Paysafe’s portfolio of operator partners, opting for the company’s traditional card solutions, Skrill USA digital wallet, as well as Paysafecard and Paysafecash eCash solutions.</p>
<p>Following the appointment of Chirag Patel at the helm of the company’s digital wallet division in August 2021, the business introduced a major revamp of Skrill USA to specifically tailor the solution for iGaming brands and the entire spectrum of their customers ranging from recreational players to VIP sports bettors. Paysafe’s product upgrades received strong adoption by gaming operators so far.</p>
<p>North of the US border, Paysafe partnered with Play Alberta following the launch of regulated online gambling in the Canadian province in the final quarter of the year.</p>
<p>The new agreement expanded the list of processing partners of the company, including the Atlantic Lottery Corporation, British Columbia Lottery Corporation, Loto-Quebec, and Ontario Lottery and Gaming to cement Paysafe’s place as the country’s undisputed leader in iGaming payments.</p>
<p>Paysafe’s affiliate marketing business, Income Access, also continued to dominate the affiliate marketing space across the US, expanding into Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Michigan, West Virginia, and Virginia, as well as adding new partners, Betfred Sports USA, Virginia Lottery and WynnBET.</p>
