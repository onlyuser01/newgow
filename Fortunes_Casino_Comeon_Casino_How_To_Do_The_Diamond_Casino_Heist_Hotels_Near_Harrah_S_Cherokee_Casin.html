<p>Montana authorities continue to search for a man who robbed the Maverick Casino in Billings on Sunday. He claimed to have a firearm and fled with an undisclosed amount of cash.</p>

<p>The sole bandit entered the gaming venue at about 12:18 pm. He then passed a note to an employee. The note asked for money and said he was armed, according to the Billings Police Department. Police said the suspect was believed to be in his 30s. He was wearing a face mask and a black hoodie.</p>
<p>No one was injured during the robbery.</p>
<p>Numerous police cars were seen at the casino later the next day. The officers apparently were searching for witnesses and evidence and reviewing surveillance video.</p>
<p>Sunday’s robbery follows another holdup in March at another Billings casino.</p>
<p>Prior Armed Robbery</p>
<p>Two Montana women were arraigned recently in federal court for allegedly committing an armed robbery on March 20 at Magic Diamond Casino. One then fired a gun into the air, and they led cops on a high-speed chase on the streets of Billings.</p>
<p>The women stole several bottles of whiskey from the small gaming venue and adjacent liquor store, authorities said. One allegedly pulled out the firearm and pointed it at two casino workers. Police did not say if the pair stole money, too, and the amount, if any.</p>
<p>The duo was later arrested. They were identified as Taliah Jeneane Ramirez, 22, of Billings, and Makyla Shayd Fetter, 27, of Harlem.</p>
<p>The charges include robbery affecting interstate commerce, possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, and possession of a firearm in a school zone, according to the Montana US Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p>Homicide Investigation Continues</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Bridger, a small community located about 47 miles south of Billings, the deaths last month of two people in Honest Toms Saloon &amp; Casino are now being investigated as a possible homicide. Autopsy results have yet to be released.</p>
<p>A fire broke out at Honest Toms. It led to finding Marla Murray, 71, and John Ahles, 33, inside the building. Both were deceased. The two victims were alone in the building during the fire. Both resided in Bridger.</p>
<p>Murray was an employee and she was working at the time. Ahles also worked at the casino. But he was off-duty that night, MTN News said.</p>
<p>Local police have yet to identify suspects in the case. The town remains “on edge,” given the uncertainty and seriousness of the crime, KRTV, a local TV station, reported.</p>
