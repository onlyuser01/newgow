<p>The leading provider of casino games, powering the iGaming operators across the globe, Pragmatic Play, announced the release of its newest Live Casino game. On Wednesday, the company confirmed the launch of Lucky 6 Roulette, a thrilling online live casino title that offers an engaging twist to the famous game. Similar to other games released by Pragmatic Play, the new Live Casino game promises exceptional experiences thanks to thrilling features.</p>
<p>The release of Lucky 6 Roulette further expands Pragmatic Play's growing portfolio of games. Its release follows the launch of Treasure Island, a new cutting-edge adventure-themed game show title launched recently by the leading iGaming content supplier.</p>
<p>Currently, Pragmatic Play launches up to eight new online slot games monthly. The provider of games for the online gambling sector also grows its Bingo games, as well as Live Casino titles such as the recently released Lucky 6 Roulette. Ultimately, Pragmatic Play's games power some of the most popular online gambling operators across the globe and the company continues to grow its portfolio of partners.</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, shared her excitement about the recently released Live Casino game. "Lucky 6 Roulette takes the excitement of live Roulette to the next level," she explained in a statement. Finally, Cornides pointed out: "It’s set in a stunning studio that serves up rich visuals to complement the premium elements of Roulette while delivering players six chances to win boosted prizes with each game round."</p>
<p>The new Live Casino game from Pragmatic Play uses the familiar elements of Roulette, one of the most recognizable casino games across the globe. However, Lucky 6 Roulette promises exceptional experiences thanks to its six Lucky Numbers. During each round of the game, players can pick their favorite numbers. "After bets are closed, each Lucky Number is given a unique Lucky Multiplier between 50x to 2,088x the player’s bet, boosting the winning potential to exciting new heights," explains Pragmatic Play. Players who place a straight-up wager on a winning number will secure the Lucky Win along with the multiplier assigned to it. This thrilling functionality promises engaging gameplay and grants a chance for mouth-watering prizes at the same time.</p>
<p>The release of Lucky 6 Roulette comes on the heels of an important partnership announced by Pragmatic Play recently. Late last month, the company confirmed it joined forces with Niké, a leading brand for the regulated gambling sector in Slovakia. Under the terms of the deal, the brand gained access to thrilling and player-favorite games from Pragmatic Play.</p>
