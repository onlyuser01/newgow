<p>Red Rake has confirmed that it will bring its portfolio of games to PokerStars Casino. PokerStars, the brand best known for its global card room and online poker platform, has been actively trying to strengthen its position in iGaming markets, attracting a number of prominent iGaming suppliers and studios.</p>
<p>As a result of this new tie-up, Red Rake will bring a number of its top-performing games and full suite to PokerStars Casino operations in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Romania, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>The partnership features high-performing titles that have been known to bring some of the best gameplay and payouts, creating a good opportunity for the brands to expand their reach and draw in new players. One of the highlight features of Red Rake’s portfolio is the "one-million ways to win," which has been adding some very interesting games over the past months.</p>
<p>Red Rake is excited to have the opportunity to significantly expand its reach across Europe and PokerStars has too responded positively, arguing that the partnership is an opportunity to move forward with the development of its online casino brand. Red Rake Gaming Malta Managing Director Nick Barr said:</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with one of the largest and most prestigious operators in the industry and very much look forward to delivering our wide array of popular titles to PokerStars players.</p>
<p>There have been several important partnerships clearly indicative of PokerStars’ most recent ambition to scale up its online casino presence. The company has been mostly signing up with several prominent suppliers that it expects to give it a significant boost in its European markets, and beyond.</p>
<p>One of those is a partnership with RubyPlay back in March this year. PokerStars has been upping its content push in online casino with companies such as Push Gaming and Relax Gaming, all in a bid of bringing players a better experience.</p>
