    <h1>Buffalo Bills Casino And Resort Phone Casino Is Casino A True Story Harrah S Casino Riverside Resort</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an account open with Gembet, I sent an email asking for self exclusion due to a gambling problem after depositing €100 and they never closed my account.</p>
<p>A further €290 was deposited and they still never closed my account after a second email was sent.</p>
<p>A further €735 was deposited after sending a third email with repetitive reference to my gambling addiction and to close my account as stated in their terms and conditions and still they did not close my account.</p>
<p>A further €330 was deposited again and they still have not closed my account.</p>
<p>4 emails I sent stating gambling addiction and to close my account and they failed to do so.</p>
<p>This is by fair the worst accountability for responsible gambling that I have seen out of any site. What makes it worse is Gembet Manager receives the email and responds claiming I have to do a different procedure which is not stated in their terms and conditions for self excluding my account. I referenced their terms and conditions to them with a screenshot, he/she acknowledges the terms and conditions by sending the exact same terms and conditions back to my highlighted in red and says I have to do something different/more than what is stated in the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Is there anything you can do to help with this matter?</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Shandy37</p>
