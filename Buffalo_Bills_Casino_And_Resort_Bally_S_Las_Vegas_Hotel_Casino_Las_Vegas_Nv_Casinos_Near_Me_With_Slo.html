    <h1>Buffalo Bills Casino And Resort Bally S Las Vegas Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Casinos Near Me With Slo</h1>

<p>This is incorrect. I have deposited $35. I did contact the relevant team. I also contacted the chat who claim they left a note for the relevant team. The problem is no where in the terms and conditions does it tell you you must make a $30 deposit. It can take weeks for them to reply to an email. If they reply at all. My current casino balance is $135. $100 of which is winnings on a no deposit bonus and $35 is money that I deposited.</p>
<p>I went ahead and sent ANOTHER email and included every possible piece of information they could possibly need. I sent the email to all departments, support, documents, and payments.</p>
<p>Please note that the terms and conditions only state this -</p>
<p>Upon requesting a withdrawal, a verification deposit may be required, if the customer doesn't have a prior deposit.</p>
<p>It does not say anything about non Australian accounts having to deposit a minimum of $30, (which I have done regardless). In fact I was first told in the chat that I could not deposit because it states in the terms and conditions that would be mixing funds and is against the rules. At this point I am fine with them just taking the no deposit winnings and letting me just have a verified account in which I can withdrawal the money I deposited. Clearly they are doing everything possible to drag this out as long as possible and to avoid paying anything.</p>
<p>Like I said the problem is, I have sent so many emails and they have only replied to me once or twice and it took weeks. I honestly do not even care about the stupid no deposit bonus winnings anymore. I would like to play with the money I deposited, but I cannot do that until they fix this.</p>
