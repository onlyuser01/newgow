<p>Dear Freddy,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://casino765.com/casino/recommended:</p>
<p>"Casino765's Self Exclusion Restrictions</p>
<p>As part of the Casino765 policy, we give you the option to take a break and suspend your use of your Casino765 account for the below time periods:</p>
<p>A one-day self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A seven-day self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A fourteen-day self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A fourteen-day self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A one-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A two-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A three-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A four-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A six-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A one-year self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A three-year self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A five-year self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>You can request a self-exclusion period by simply sending an email to our customer service department support@casino765.com.</p>
<p>During your self-exclusion time period Casino765 will block your account for the entire Casino765 platform and any new account that you might attempt to open on the Casino765 platform will also be blocked.</p>
<p>During a self-exclusion period your account will be blocked and this will be irrevocable until the self-exclusion period is over. Once your self-exclusion period has come to an end a one day cooling off period will apply before your account is reopened.</p>
<p>Please note that a request for a self-exclusion period may take up to 72 hours to be processed."</p>
<p>Could you please forward me the very first email that you have sent to the casino requesting your account to be closed? I received the one from 15th of May, but if there’s any previous communication, I would like to receive it too. My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would recommend sending one last email to casino. Include your username, reason to close your account and specific period of your self-exclusion. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
