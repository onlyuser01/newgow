<p>We Catch Up with the Industry</p>
<p>This week, we mostly spoke with the shortlisted candidates for the Casino Guru Awards. We had the opportunity to speak with two well-established companies in the sector, including Wow Partners, which is running in the category for The Most Effective Handling of Complaints, who spoke about the importance of customer complaints and how they help calibrate their offer.</p>
<p>Customer complaints have been an important tool in also better analyzing what customers want and how the gambling industry can deliver it, the company notes.</p>
<p>Our next conversation was equally exciting as we got to catch up with Mindway AI, another Casino Guru Awards shortlisted candidate who is competing in the Best Implementation of RG Tools and Most Impactful Social Responsibility categories. The company spoke of how its product has created a robust pathway for industry stakeholders to follow when addressing gambling harm in consumers.</p>
<p>The unique markers that the company uses to track, analyze, and intervene in cases of harm is what allows companies from the sector to have greater success in helping consumers steer clear of reckless practices. Mindway Ai’s approach is founded in science and big data, and is well worth reading in detail.</p>
