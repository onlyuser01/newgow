    <h1>Cairo Marriott Hotel Omar Khayyam Casino Barona Resort And Casino Red Dog Casino Quest Casino Spokan</h1>

<p>HappyCasino, a Pay’n’Play casino that is owned and operated by the Malta-based iGaming company, Glitnor Group, announced that it has gone live with a full collection of Swintt’s range of video slot games.</p>
<p>The platform, which was launched in August this year and was specially designed for the Swedish gaming market, will offer more than 40 popular releases from the Malta-based casino games supplier, including titles in the SwinttSelect and Premium slot ranges.</p>
<p>Customers, who enjoy more modern video slot games, will have access to new titles including Candy Gold, The Crown starring Vinnie Jones and Aloha Spirt Xtra Lock. The last one includes a patented XtraLock system that allows customers to use Tiki Spins, which, in turn, might provide access to four local jackpot awards.</p>
<p>In addition, Swedish customers will enjoy other games, such as Extra Win X, Master of Books Unlimited, and Book of Dino Unlimited, combining land-based slots with free spins and expanding wilds.</p>
<p>Swintt to Become a Leading Gaming Provider</p>
<p>With this new cooperation, Swintt aims to establish itself as a leading provider of online gaming products in Sweden by placing its games in front of a wide new audience. The partnership between Glitnor and Swintt promises to be long and profitable.</p>
<p>David Mann, chief executive officer at Swintt, commented that the collaboration between the software provider, who recently received the award in the category “Innovation in Mobile” at the 2022 EGR B2B Awards, and HappyCasino, which is an innovative mobile-first casino, “looks set to be a match made in heaven.” He added that the casino games supplier was excited to share its full suite of Select and Premium slots with Swedish players and hoped that it would help HappyCasino embed in the Swedish gambling market.</p>
<p>Popular Games = Popular Casino</p>
<p>On the other hand, David Schwieler, chief executive officer of Lucky Casino &amp; Happy Casinos stated that the popularity of any new online casino depends on the popularity of the games that it offers to the customers. He also said that by including Swintt games and some other titles of different leading suppliers in their platform, HappyCasino would manage to deliver an unparalleled gaming experience to players in Sweden.</p>
<p>Glitnor Continues Expanding in North America</p>
<p>Earlier in October, David Flynn, chief executive officer of Glitnor Group, commented that the gaming company was going through the Canadian licensing process and its plans include stepping into the North American gaming market. Glitnor Group operates already in 12 US states and recently obtained a license to do business in Michigan.</p>
