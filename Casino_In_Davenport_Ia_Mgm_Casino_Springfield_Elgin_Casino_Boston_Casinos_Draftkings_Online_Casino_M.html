    <h1>Casino In Davenport Ia Mgm Casino Springfield Elgin Casino Boston Casinos Draftkings Online Casino M</h1>

<p>I made an account at mystake but, after losing quite a lot of money, proceeded to have this account excluded for a period of 5 years as I feared I was developing a gambling problem.</p>
<p>A few days later, I created a second account on mystake. I was unaware that this went against their terms and conditions. I was unable to verify my details to make a withdrawal from this second account so I emailed the support team asking for help. They did not inform me that duplicate accounts were not permitted even though I explained this was my second account. Rather they promptly emailed back saying my details had now been confirmed and I could make a withdrawal.</p>
<p>After loosing even more money, I requested to have this second account excluded.</p>
<p>Since then, I have been reading their terms and conditions and have realised that this second account should never have been permitted, especially for my own safety as I had already taken the steps to exclude my original account.</p>
<p>In their terms and conditions it says that on the creation of two or more accounts, the company will terminate the duplicate accounts and refund deposits minus a 20% transaction fee. This should have been done immediately after my first deposit however it was not and I have now deposited and lost even more money.</p>
<p>My question is: am I able to get any of my deposits refunded as mystake knew this was a duplicate account as I had informed them by email when it was created yet they still allowed me to make deposits and gamble?</p>
