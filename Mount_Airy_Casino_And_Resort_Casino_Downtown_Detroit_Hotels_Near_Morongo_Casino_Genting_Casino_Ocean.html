<p>LVCVA Boss Gets Hefty Bonus Plus Salary Hike, As Las Vegas Tourism Agency Brings in Auditing Firm to Justify Expenses</p>

<p>Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) CEO Rossi Ralenkotter has received a six percent salary increase and one-time 50 percent salary bonus of $208,000, after the governmental agency’s board unanimously approved the performance-based rewards.</p>

<p>But not everyone is happy about the payments, and some legal experts are questioning whether the compensation process violated the state’s open-meeting law.</p>
<p>LVCVA Compensation Committee Chairman Chuck Bowling, whose day job is being president and COO of Mandalay Bay, announced the benefits in an emailed statement. However, there was little-to-no explanation regarding how the board arrived at such its determinations.</p>
<p>Nevada Press Association Barry Smith told the Las Vegas Review-Journal, “There’s no reason not to have that discussion in the open meeting. That’s the whole purpose behind the [open meeting] statute.”</p>
<p>The LVCVA is at the center of recent public criticism after the Review-Journal published a series of stories on the agency’s extravagant wining and dining practices, which included $700,000 on alcohol and $85,000 on showgirls over the past three years. Do the math: it comes out to about 15,555 shots per year at $15 a shot, and unless they commissioned some private performances of “Jubilee,” we’re a bit lost on what $85K worth of 5’10” leggy beauties would get them.</p>
<p>The LVCVA is funded through a hotel room tax on all stays in Clark County.</p>
<p>Guaranteed Perks</p>
<p>It seems the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority knew that Ralenkotter’s bonus and salary bump might cause some media pushback. In a statement, Bowling said the CEO “deserves every penny,” and that his performance record “speaks for itself.”</p>
<p>Ralenkotter’s new base salary will be roughly $440,000 per year, but the “one-time” 50 percent salary bonuses are certainly not out of the norm. In fact, the LVCVA boss can pretty much count on them, historically speaking. From 2016 back to 2014, he’s collected a bonus each year, from $166,200 last year to $127,862 in 2015. In 2014, he earned an extra $147,992, and each time, they were referred to as “one-time” extras.</p>
<p>According to Transparent Nevada, Ralenkotter’s new salary will make him the third-highest paid state employee in Nevada, behind only two surgery professors at UNLV Reno, both of whom make $1 million annually. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval makes less than $150,000 for his services, and state legislators collect just $150 per session day, along with $142 in per diem.</p>
<p>LVCVA on the Defensive</p>
<p>For those skeptical of the LVCVA’s apparent opulent spending and compensation packages, fear not: the agency is investigating. The authority announced this week that it’s hired accounting firm Piercy Bowler Taylor &amp; Kern to perform a financial review of its own books.</p>
<p>“Allegations were brought forth, and I want to make sure we’re doing the public’s work and protecting the taxpayers,” North Las Vegas Mayor and LVCVA Policy Committee Chairman John Lee explained.</p>
<p>Agency Chairman Lawrence Weekly responded in April to the wooing of potential convention leaders with food, entertainment, top-shelf booze, and showgirls, by saying, “You’ve got to give something to get something.”</p>
<p>“Vegas means business. LVCVA are doing just that. Working to keep us in that #1 spot,” Weekly later tweeted.</p>
<p>We just want to get on their holiday gift list. Macallan’s “Fine and Rare 1937” looks nice.</p>
