<p>Leading online poker operator PokerStars announced a new stop for its 2022 Asia Pacific Poker Tour (APPT) live poker tournament series, APPT Cambodia.</p>
<p>Expanding APPT Borders</p>
<p>The inaugural APPT Cambodia live poker festival is scheduled to take place November 3-13, 2022, in the Grand Ballroom at the award-winning NagaWorld resort in the Mekong region and is expected to attract poker pros and casual players alike.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, head of Global Live Event Operations at PokerStars Cedric Billot outlined the credentials of NagaWorld resort, “excited to expand APPT borders” by running an event of the 2022 APPT in Cambodia.</p>
<p>“Nagaworld is a fantastic venue where we hope players will have fun both on and away from the tables,” Billot added.</p>
<p>The poker festival that will kick in with a $50,000 GTD $300 Buy-In event will feature a $400,000 GTD $1,500 Buy-In Main Event, as well as a $5,000 High Roller and a $10,000 Super High Roller.</p>
<p>PokerStars announced that it would be running online satellites to the APPT Cambodia festival, with three different packages up for grabs: Package, including $1,500 Main Event Buy-In, $490 in hotel expenses and $200 in general expenses; Seat &amp; Expenses, comprising the $1,500 Buy-In for the Main Event and $300 in general expenses; and, Seat Only, covering the $1,500 Buy-In for the Main Event only.</p>
<p>Fun and Entertainment</p>
<p>The organizers of the poker festival also confirmed that the APPT Cambodia Players Party will take place on November 12 at the Arena Sports Bar of the integrated resort.</p>
<p>Spread across two sprawling properties, NagaWorld is offering 5-star accommodation and plenty of food and dining options, including Chinese, Japanese, French, and Italian cuisine, alongside the typical for the region Southeast Asian food, while night clubs and karaoke parlors are there to create memorable experiences for the resort’s visitors.</p>
<p>According to the active operational requirements, all visitors should wear face masks upon entry and within the NagaWorld property, including the poker area and masks will be available at the entrances and upon request. Smoking will be limited to the designated smoking areas in the ballroom foyer only.</p>
<p>The 2022 APPT PokerStars LIVE series already featured two festivals in Manila, APPT Open Manila from May 30 to June 5, and APPT Manila from July 29 to August 7, hosted at the Okada Manila casino resort that was recently in the center of a corporate dispute and forced its operator to postpone the completion of its merger and Nasdaq listing.</p>
