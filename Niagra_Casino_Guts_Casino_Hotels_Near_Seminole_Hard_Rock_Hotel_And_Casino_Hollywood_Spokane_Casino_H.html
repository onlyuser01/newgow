    <h1>Niagra Casino Guts Casino Hotels Near Seminole Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Hollywood Spokane Casino H</h1>

<p>Some 40,000 workers, represented by the Culinary and Bartenders Unions, voted in favor of new five-year gaming contracts with Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts and Caesars International</p>
<p>It took seven months for unionized hospitality and gaming industry workers in Las Vegas to secure new five-year gaming contracts with three of the major casino and entertainment companies. Efforts of the Culinary and Bartenders Unions resulted in the ratification of contracts with Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment. Some 40,000 unionized workers within the entertainment and gaming sector in Las Vegas were able to secure better working conditions, increased wages and improved job security.</p>
<p>On Monday, 99% of the workers voted in favor of the contract with Caesars Entertainment. Then, on Tuesday, 99% of the unionized workers with MGM Resorts voted to accept and ratify the new five-year contract. Finally, on Wednesday, 99% of the employees with Wynn Resorts approved and accepted the new contract. The voting confirmed the success of the unionized employees and comes after months of intense negotiations and fears over the largest strike of hospitality workers in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>While the new five-year contracts for Caesars, MGM and Wynn employees were voted on and accepted, the Culinary Union continues to negotiate with more operators across Sin City. The debate about better conditions for another 10,000 to 15,000 unionized casino and entertainment industry workers continues through negotiations with some 24 independent and downtown casino operators in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“The Culinary Union has won the best contracts ever in its 88-year history,“ reads a statement released by the Culinary Union</p>
<p>Entertainment and Casino Industry Workers Secure Better Wages</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes at a time when the Culinary union is celebrating its 88-year anniversary. Ted Pappageorge, the union’s secretary-treasurer, explained that the total compensation secured for the workers at Wynn, Caesars and MGM for the next five years is a staggering $2 billion. He revealed that thanks to this historic achievement, the money will remain in Las Vegas, benefitting neighborhoods and communities.</p>
<p>“The total compensation won by the Culinary Union for MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, and Wynn Resorts workers is approximately $2 billion over the total five year contract – that’s $2 billion which will stay in Las Vegas and will benefit every community and neighborhood.“ Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union</p>
<p>Pappageorge confirmed that hospitality and gaming industry workers will benefit from a 10% wage increase for the first year of the new contract. The total increase in wages for the full five-year contract would be 32%. He estimated that the average income per hour for unionized workers is $28. This hourly rate will increase significantly, hitting $37 an hour, including benefits, under the new five-year contract. Finally, Pappageorge commended the casino and entertainment companies that agreed to invest in their workers.</p>
