    <h1>Hotels Near Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Fl Casinos In Philadelphia Little River Casino Resort Gr</h1>

<p>Hi. I had received an email from this provider with a reload offer. I then deposited €150.00 and got a bonus of €150.00. After that, a total of €300.00 was in my betting account.</p>
<p>After fulfilling the bonus terms I had a balance of €577.84. I then wanted to withdraw €300.00 from this money. After the withdrawal request was made, I received an email that my winnings were canceled because I had violated the terms and conditions and I can only withdraw the amount of €150.00 that I had paid in.</p>
<p>In order to be able to have this €150.00 paid out, I should agree that I accept the terms and conditions and that I agree to the consequences of violating them (cancellation of the winnings made with the bonus).</p>
<p>I then read through the terms and conditions and found that I had not violated a single point.</p>
<p>I then wrote an email to Wallacebet. They write back to me that it stays that way. I can only withdraw the deposited amount of €150.00 and then only if I agree to the terms and conditions. What shoud that? So it seems that Wallacebet itself knows that they are not allowed to act like that, otherwise they wouldn't need my approval for the acceptance of the terms and conditions!? I have never experienced anything like this with any other provider!</p>
<p>I would like to withdraw my entire balance (deposit + bonus winnings) and ask CasinoGuru for help. Regards</p>
