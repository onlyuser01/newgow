<p>BETER Live, a live casino subsidiary of the leading betting products supplier BETER, will power Asia’s #1 distributor, QTech Games, with its live casino portfolio. The new content will help BETER reinforce its foothold in Asia, QTech’s primary market.</p>
<p>QTech Boosts Its Offering with BETER’s Live Casino Content</p>
<p>BETER is one of the fastest-growing companies in the sector, offering some of the most innovative and proven casino, sports and esports solutions. BETER Live’s suite of live casino titles continues to cement itself as some of the strongest content in the industry.</p>
<p>As per the deal, QTech will receive access to BETER Live’s famed content, which includes both well-known and innovative titles. The former provider offers beloved games such as Blackjack, Roulette and French Roulette, as well as some exotic live games such as the Indian games of Andar Bahar and Teen Patti. QTech will, therefore, be able to engage all kinds of bettors – both those seeking to play traditional casino games and those who want to try something new.</p>
<p>BETER Live’s content is available in English, Ukrainian and Russian, allowing the company’s games to appeal to a wide variety of gamers. In addition, all of BETER’s titles follow a simple philosophy – that entertainment in gaming comes first. As a result, all of its games are shot in cinema-style studios and are hosted by experienced casino dealers.</p>
<p>Thanks to its deal with QTech, BETER will be able to launch its content with QTech’s many clients in the industry. This will help the ambitious supplier greatly expand its footprint in Asia.</p>
<p>BETER Believes QTech Is Its “Natural Habitat“</p>
<p>Ulf Norder, chief commercial officer of QTech Games, said he is thrilled about this agreement with BETER. He lauded the latter company as a “rising-star supplier” and praised it for offering great fast-paced games. Norder believes that BETER Live’s strength lies in the highly sought-after Andar Bahar and Bet on Teen Patti titles. He is, therefore, happy to be able to include them in QTech’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Together, we will continue to raise the bar and shape a localized experience for global players. We can’t wait to witness how these games perform across a range of untapped markets which, in some cases, break new ground for BETER Live. Ulf Norder, CCO, QTech Games</p>
<p>Dan Gibas, BETER’s business development manager, described QTech as “a natural habitat” for his company’s live dealer games. He added that he is happy to see BETER foray into new markets and expand its reach.</p>
<p>BETER Live offers a flexible and deeper live-dealer configuration to gaming operators or white-label providers all over the world. Needless to say, entering into this agreement with QTech Games tracks our key strategy to fully leverage our reach, and we look forward to seeing how fresh audiences embrace our content. Dan Gibas, business development manager, BETER</p>
