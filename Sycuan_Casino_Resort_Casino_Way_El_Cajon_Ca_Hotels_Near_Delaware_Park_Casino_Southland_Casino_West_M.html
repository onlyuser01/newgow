<p>The 2023 Orange Bowl brings us a clash between the #6 Georgia Bulldogs and the #5 Florida State Seminoles. The college bowl game is played at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, FL, on Saturday, December 30</p>
<p>It’s been nearly 24 years since we last saw a Georgia Bulldogs vs. Florida State Seminoles game. But these two NCAAF heavyweights will meet on the penultimate day of 2023 in the Orange Bowl.</p>
<p>Both teams are coming off a great season, with Georgia barely missing winning the SEC title, losing by just a field goal to Alabama. Florida State went 13-0 in 2023 but still missed the College Football Playoffs.</p>
<p>The Seminoles probably feel disappointed because of that, but they’ve got an opportunity to turn the season around by winning an NY6 bowl. Judging by the 2023 Orange Bowl odds, their chance is very slim.</p>

<p>Reasons Why Georgia Bulldogs are 14-Point Favorites to Win the 2023 Orange Bowl</p>
<p>For a good part of the 2023 season, the Georgia Bulldogs were the highest-ranked college football team. However, their superb run of 29 wins in a row came to an end in the SEC Championship Game, in which they lost to the Alabama Crimson Tide 27-24.</p>

<p>Before the game, the Bulldogs were seen as one-TD favorites, which is no surprise given how dominant they were throughout the season. They came close to winning the game, or at least taking it to overtime, but their offense couldn’t outsmart Bama’s defense.</p>
<p>That was a bit surprising given that Georgia is the No. 9 offense in the nation, averaging 37.6 points per game. This, however, doesn’t mean that Georgia’s quarterback Carson Beck and his teammates have forgotten how to play. It’s just the opposite and they’re going to show it in the 2023 Orange Bowl.</p>
<p>Can Florida State Upset the Orange Bowl Odds?</p>
<p>The short answer is no. It’s because their opponent in the December 30 bowl game is one of the very best teams in the entire nation. Of course, this doesn’t mean the Seminoles aren’t good.</p>
<p>On the contrary, they’re a well-rounded collective whose offense is 14th in the nation (35.3 PPG) and whose defense is 7th (16.2). Further, these guys are undefeated in the 2023 college football season with a 13-0 record.</p>
<p>So, why are they 14-point underdogs in the 2023 Orange Bowl, which is taking place in their own state? The main reason is that the Seminoles are without their starting quarterback Jordan Travis, who suffered a season-ending injury about a month ago.</p>
<p>Actually, his injury was one of the reasons why the Seminoles were left out of the College Football Playoffs.</p>
<p>Georgia Bulldogs vs. Florida State 2023 Orange Bowl Prediction</p>
<p>Even if Florida State’s QB was fit, we’d back Georgia. The Bulldogs are a fantastic team that was unlucky to lose the SEC title game and miss out on the playoffs. However, these guys have no intention of losing two games in a row.</p>
<p>We think they’re going to win the 2023 Orange Bowl, and they’re going to do it by scoring at least 14 points more than the Seminoles.</p>
<p>Pick: Georgia Bulldogs -14.0</p>
