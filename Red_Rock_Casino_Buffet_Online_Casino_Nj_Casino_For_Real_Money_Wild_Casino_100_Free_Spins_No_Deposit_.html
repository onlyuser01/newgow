<p>Stewart is excited about her promotion and noted that it comes at a turning point for Bede Gaming and its expansion</p>
<p>Bede Gaming, a UK-based gambling platform and software company, has reinforced its team with the addition of a new chief legal &amp; client services officer. The one up to the task is the seasoned Kirsty Stewart who will bring two decades of legal experience.</p>
<p>Stewart is by no means a new face. She has worked with Bede Gaming since March 2018 and used to serve as Bede’s legal counsel for three months. After that, she was promoted to general counsel &amp; company secretary. In this position, Stewart helped the team with business contracting and negotiations. She was also responsible for governing the contractual agreements with the company’s existing clients.</p>
<p>Stewart also served Bede as a data protection officer, helping the provider’s Risk &amp; Compliance team with governance and privacy-related matters. Thanks to her hard work, Stewart will now join the company’s executive team.</p>
<p>According to Bede Gaming, the appointment of a lawyer into the company leadership attests to the company’s maturity.</p>
<p>Stewart’s Promotion Comes amid a Rapid Expansion for Bede</p>
<p>Bede Gaming’s chief executive officer, Colin Cole-Johnson, welcomed Stewart to the company. He praised her for being an expert on the company’s existing commercial relationships and noted that she is playing a major role in ongoing customer contracts and new business activity.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense for her skillset to sit within our Executive Team, helping shape our ongoing commercial &amp; customer strategies. Colin Cole-Johnson, CEO, Bede Gaming</p>
<p>Stewart also shared her sentiments on her promotion. She noted that bringing the client services and legal teams together under one leadership is an important step for the company. According to her, the move underlines Bede’s dedication to its clients and its commitment to growing and improving its customer relations.</p>
<p>Aligning all commercial objectives in this way allows more insight into our customers’ drivers and goals, and enhances our understanding as to how best to achieve the success of our clients, which is a really exciting prospect. Kirsty Stewart, chief legal &amp; client services, Bede Gaming</p>
<p>Stewart added that she hopes that Bede Gaming’s clients will recognize its efforts to be a valuable partner. According to her, the company wants to gain the complete trust of its customers as it helps them deliver their strategic goals.</p>
<p>Stewart concluded that she is looking forward to serving as the company’s chief legal &amp; client services officer.</p>
<p>Stewart’s appointment follows quite a few major developments for the company. Three years ago, the company became part of the Gauselmann Group and named Colin Cole-Johnson as its chief executive officer.</p>
