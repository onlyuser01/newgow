<p>Interest in iGaming in the United States is soaring and the quickest way to gauge the veracity of this statement is by taking a look at the number of suppliers who are pushing to expand and the operators that are similarly keen on growing their portfolios with quality products.</p>
<p>This is where High 5 Games and Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino come in with the supplier and operator signing a new partnership that covers the Pennsylvanian iGaming market and brings an array of titles by High 5, including Jaguar Princess, Dangerous Beauty, and Golden Knight, the companies said in a press release shared via email with Casino Guru News.</p>
<p>Caesars and High 5 are de facto expanding a long-overdue move in the Keystone State, with the two companies having worked together in New Jersey since 2014, and High 5 becoming one of the earliest studio providers for Caesars.</p>
<p>Over the years, High 5 has established itself as a trustworthy and reliable brand and a player-favorite at that, inspiring confidence in Caesars to pursue further growth in Pennsylvania. Besides New Jersey, though, the two companies have worked together in Michigan and not least, Ontario in Canada.</p>
<p>Commenting on the fresh opportunity, High 5 Games CEO Tony Singer spoke highly of the "pivotal moment" this expansion was for the company:</p>
<p>Our priority is always to support our operator partners wherever they operate, and our performance-proven casino titles are well suited to enhance their offering and ensure our mutual long-term success.</p>
<p>Caesars Digital SVP of igaming Matthew Sunderland was similarly pleased to see the partnership between the two companies grow and evolve over the years. He hailed High 5 Games’ products as exceptional and said that the launch in Pennsylvania further elevated the operator’s selection of games.</p>
<p>The expansion comes only several months after High 5 Games acquired a supplier license from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Prior to signing this content partnership with Caesars, High 5 Games already probed the local waters with a similar content deal with BetMGM, another well-established operator in the market.</p>
<p>The rollout of the content coincides with the launch of the Caesars Tropicana Online Casino in the Keystone State, which should give the company a significant presence in the local iGaming market.</p>
