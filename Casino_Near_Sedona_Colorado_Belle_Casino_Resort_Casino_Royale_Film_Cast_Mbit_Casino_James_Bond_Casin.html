<p>FanDuel will be able to channel more players toward its platform and engage them with Playtech’s cutting-edge products</p>
<p>Playtech, a leading gambling software development company, has unveiled a new partnership agreement with the North American gaming powerhouse FanDuel. The new Canada-facing deal will see the former company roll out live casino content on FanDuel’s Canadian platform, reinforcing its local product offering.</p>
<p>FanDuel will thus be able to channel more players toward its platform and engage them with Playtech’s cutting-edge products. The deal will see Playtech leverage its live casino studio in Riga, Latvia, to supply games to the operator. The studio has been designed with the Canadian market in mind and offers content that is tailored to the Canadian players’ needs.</p>
<p>Playtech, on the other hand, will be able to expand its Canadian footprint, in line with its ambition to grow its overall North American presence. The company has been steadily expanding its global business, recently adding studios for games like Adventures Beyond Wonderland and Big Bad Wolf to its product lineup.</p>
<p>The agreement with FanDuel comes several weeks after Playtech signed a major deal with Adjarabet, launching content in Armenia and Georgia.</p>
<p>Canadian Players Will Be Able to Enjoy Premium Live Casino Content</p>
<p>Playtech’s vice president of commercial, George Voyatzis, commented on the matter, expressing his delight about the tie-up. He called the agreement a “really exciting moment” for his company and its North American expansion.</p>
<p>Our partnership with FanDuel marks a really exciting moment for Playtech and we look forward to delivering our Live Casino games for FanDuel and its users across Ontario. George Voyatzis, VP of commercial, Playtech</p>
<p>Dale Hooper, FanDuel Canada’s general manager, also shared his thoughts on the deal. He noted that the FanDuel Live Casino studio understands the needs of the Canadian players and is designed to meet and exceed their expectations.</p>
<p>Speaking of FanDuel, the North American gambling juggernaut recently announced the launch of two new features that reinforced its basketball offerings. Thanks to its agreement with the National Basketball Association, the operator was able to launch The Pulse and NBA League Pass.</p>
<p>In September, on the other hand, FanDuel launched its sports betting app in Kentucky, capitalizing on the Bluegrass State’s fresh sports betting market.</p>
