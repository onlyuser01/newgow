    <h1>Real Casino Games Online Airway Heights Casino Pala Resort And Casino Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom</h1>

<p>It all started on June 26th, 2023. I want to withdrawal some winnings that I've earned from Ruby Slots. I currently have over $800 that I am trying to withdrawal. In order for me to withdrawal, I need to KYC and verify my account. I have changed my home address and name, so I asked customer support if I can update my personal information on my ruby slots account. Customer support said I can change my name and address as long as I provide ID front and back, and an utility bill that proves I am currently living at that recent residence. They said as long as I receive a reference number back from sending the emails, then I could give them the reference number and they can officially start the process. So I sent in all documents needed to change my ruby slots info. The first 3 times I sent the updated information in, customer support told me to send it to "Documents@rubyslots.com". I noticed each time I did it, I received no reference number and they said "they didn'tsee my emails". So I contacted customer support for the 4TH time and told them that no reference numbers come back after sending the KYC emails. This new customer support person told me that I was sending the KYC emails to a WRONG email. (This makes me feel like they are trying hard to keep my money so I can either get impatient and lose it, or just keep prolonging the process so I'd give up or something). So, I push through the stress and get the correct email I was suppose to use to send my KYC documents to, which is "Documents@rubyslotsmail.com".</p>
<p>As I'm talking to the customer support for the 4th time, I send the KYC documents while we're still connected, hoping he can see the documents and fix the issue then and there. He tells me he still doesn't see the documents, so I started sending the KYC documents from a whole new device and different emails, hoping one of these methods work because I have no idea if their bs'sing me or if it's really an error on my end. But after taking a solid look on my end, everything is working properly. I sent an email to my friend and they received it with no issue or delay, so I don't understand why ruby slots isn't seeing my updated kyc documents email. Towards the end of this conversation, the customer support said thanks for sending the documents, and that the team will update my account as soon as they can. Which I've been told before but still haven't seen it. Then he told me it can take up to ANOTHER 5+ business days to update this. But honestly speaking, I wouldn't be surprised if another week goes by and they just hit me with the same loop. I really need help. I was blessed enough to get a few hundred dollars on this site, expecting I would've had it in hand by now, but it feels like this casino is blocking my blessing.</p>
<p>If they can actually help me and give me my winnings, then I can respect them for that and update everyone on the problem being fixed. If not, then I have a right to expect ruby slots to be a scam casino.</p>
