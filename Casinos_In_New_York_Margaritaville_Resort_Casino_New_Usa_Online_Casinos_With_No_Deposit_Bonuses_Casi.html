<p>Agent 51 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed on an off-brand X-Files agent.</p>
<p>Set in a ramshackled office, this game is full of mysterious aliens. Retro investigation equipment and boxes of evidence litter the room, and players will need to solve a sci-fi mystery.</p>
<p>The dashing and dishevelled special agent peers out at the players from his reel with a conspiratory look. Players will want to be on his team and capture an alien or two.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The sound effects only kick in when players hit spin and consist of a satisfying click and a dramatic series of notes. Wins are accompanied by a shimmering chiming. The absence of ambient sound or background music may suit some players well, as there is nothing to tire of.</p>
<p>Right away, players will notice the colourful and adorable alien symbols. They bring to mind the style of 2000s special effects and this ups the nostalgic vibe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the many alien footprint symbols give the reels an appropriate air of mystery. Players will enjoy imagining which extraterrestrial creatures have left each tiny print.</p>
<p>The dim office in the background has an air of a scattered genius about it, with a pinboard covered in clues. Light filters through an old set of blinds and gives the room a dramatic look.</p>
<p>Overall, the aesthetic of the game readily brings to mind the X-Files inspiration and creates an entertaining atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Agent 51 is a 5 reel, three row slot, with 20 win lines.</p>
<p>Players collect accumulation symbols in a set of files above the reels.</p>
<p>When players hit their 10th spin, the accumulation symbols that players have collected become Special Expanding symbols. Players may land Accumulation symbols with x2 or x3 multipliers.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Special Expanding, Accumulation, and Extra Free Spins symbols.</p>
<p>Special Expanding symbols make up winning combinations in any place on a win line.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Wild symbols in any position, they are awarded x2 their total bet. With 4 Wild symbols players get x4 their bet, and with 5 Wild symbols they receive x20 their bet.</p>
<p>Landing 3 or more scattered Wild symbols awards 8 free spins to the player. The Free Spins bonus is possible to retrigger.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.73%, well above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€50 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium-high, which makes it a reasonable match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium-high volatility X-Files-inspired game.</p>
<p>With a solid mathematical profile and a fun theme, this slot is well worth checking out. Fans of the X-File will enjoy the references to the inspiration material, and everyone else will simply enjoy the cute aliens.</p>
<p>The varied bonuses give this game some extra interest and keep things engaging.</p>
