<p>Award-winning Hosting Provider for the international iGaming market Internet Vikings has announced yet another crucial milestone for its growth in the US. The 2008-based company with its headquarter in Stockholm has entered the Louisiana market by launching its hosting solutions in the Pelican State. The company is also currently present in Michigan and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Tireless Work, Unique Solutions</p>
<p>Chief executive officer and company founder Richard Vikström spoke about the tireless work of the team that has generated “solutions that are far different from other hosting companies”. He also praised their innovative solutions that can cater to the one-of-a-kind needs of individual clients. Speaking about the expansion on the Louisiana market, Vikström said he was “glad” to operate in the new state. He also expressed the company’s intention to maintain its “steady growth”, expand its database of customers, and reach fresh markets in the US.</p>
<p>The company’s chief technology officer and founder Victor Jerlin called the new Louisiana development “a great achievement”, mentioning the state’s “wealth of opportunities.” Jerlin also spoke about the important growth in the “lucrative” gaming sector here. The fact that Internet Vikings will be “at the forefront” will enable them to provide a vast array of solutions to a variety of different businesses, concluded Jerlin.</p>
<p>Internet Vikings currently has a staff of more than 70 specialists working from five different countries. Their portfolio of solutions features cloud hosting services across important jurisdictions worldwide, along with search engine optimization hosting, hosting colocation, and managed hosting.</p>
<p>Louisiana Entered the Legals Sports Betting Market Last June</p>
<p>Louisiana was added to the list of US states that have legalized sports betting last in June, with an official debut a few months later in October. The online sports betting debut of the Louisiana market took place at the beginning of the current year. The list of operators who have obtained their legal authorizations to function in the state includes both tribal and commercial casinos, online venues, and racetracks.</p>
<p>Baton Rouge Launch &amp; More Plans of Expansion</p>
<p>The company made its presence felt in the Pelican State in Baton Rouge last December 2021. Using its deep knowledge of how to browse the US market, Internet Vikings has big plans to repeat the experience in a few more states that are currently getting ready to recognize and legalize online gaming. In January, the company entered the state of Illinois. At the beginning of July, Internet Vikings announced the appointment of Rickard Vikström as the new chief executive officer.</p>
