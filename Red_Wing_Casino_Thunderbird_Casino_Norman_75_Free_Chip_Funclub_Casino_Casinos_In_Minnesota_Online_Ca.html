<p>Kambi Group, a leading business-to-business supplier of sports betting solutions, has announced an extension of its agreement with the African casino and hospitality giant Sun International. Under the extended deal, Kambi will continue to power the operator’s sports betting operations with industry-leading sports betting tech and services.</p>
<p>This agreement will help the renowned supplier consolidate its presence in the region. Africa is considered to be a largely untapped market with Kambi being one of the companies keen to explore its potential. The supplier has been working with Sun International and its SunBet brand since November 2017 when the initial term of their deal began.</p>
<p>SunBet is currently one of the biggest online gambling and betting brands in South Africa. Its parent company, which is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, also owns some of the most prestigious casinos and hotels in the country.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Happy to Deepen Their Relationship</p>
<p>SunBet’s chief executive officer, Simon Gregory, commented on the extended agreement with Kambi. He said that Sun International is thrilled by the opportunity to continue its sports betting partnership with Kambi. Gregory also said that his team is happy to continue using the latter company’s award-winning tech and deepen its ties with the world-class supplier.</p>
<p>The CEO added that Kambi will be instrumental to his ambitious plans of growing the SunBet brand.</p>
<p>We have ambitious plans for the SunBet brand over the coming years and I am thrilled we will continue to do this with the support of a world-leading B2B sportsbook like Kambi. Simon Gregory, CEO, SunBet</p>
<p>Kristian Nylén, Kambi’s chief executive officer and co-founder, also shared his thoughts on the agreement. He said that his team is pleased to extend the deal with Sun Internation, which he lauded as one of the “premier gaming and hospitality groups” in Africa.</p>
<p>Nylén added that Sun International is a cherished partner and one that Kambi is glad to continue working with.</p>
<p>Since we first partnered in 2017, Sun International has become a valuable partner to Kambi and we look forward to seeing the company’s SunBet online betting brand continue to go from strength to strength. Kristian Nylén, CEO, Kambi Group</p>
