<p>Sic Bo is one of the hottest new games on casino floors and with a good reason. Players who have got a little weary of baccarat and blackjack are now on the lookout for a game of chance that involves dice and is not Craps.</p>
<p>This is where the ancient Chinese gambling game of Sic Bo comes in. Played with three dice, today we take a look at how the game is played, and also – how you can win.</p>
<p>Even better, we bring you a sic bo strategy that you can use in your favorite casino and make sure that you are really playing based on the best possible odds. Just like any other game of chance, Sic Bo is about understanding the odds of certain outcomes.</p>
<p>Let’s cut right to it and introduce you to the game, and some of the best casino Sic Bo strategy options to try yourself.</p>
<p>What Is Sic Bo?</p>
<p>Sic Bo is a game that is best described as “chuck a luck.” It looks a little like Craps and definitely seems like the more difficult of the two games to play, but it actually is not!</p>
<p>Even the strategies for Sic Bo are much simpler and streamlined, as they are based on rather straightforward outcomes and possibilities.</p>
<p>So, what of it? Well, the game boils down to a dealer rolling the dice out of a small chest or cage, unlike Craps where people alternate to shoot the dice. You don’t actually have to aim for the pass or don’t pass the line.</p>
<p>Rather, a sic bo strategy comes down to guessing which of the numbers the three dice will show. It’s as simple as that. Let’s dig a little deeper.</p>
<p>Sic Bo Strategy: Start with the ‘How to Play’</p>
<p>First, rules clarification is in order. The first time you take a look at a Sic Bo table you may think to yourself that it looks quite complicated, but there really is nothing much happening here.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example with the gameplay itself. A typical round of Sic Bo will boil down to players choosing what outcomes to stake out.</p>
<p>Then, the dealer will get the chest, shake the dice inside, and let them roll. Every number that you have bet on and appears on the dice is a winner. So, hold on – is this really all? Yes, this pretty much is it.</p>
<p>What Bets Can I Bet on Sic Bo?</p>
<p>Before you put any casino Sic Bo strategy to good use, you need to naturally know what you are betting on or in other words…</p>
<p>What you are strategizing about, correct?</p>
<p>Well, a table of Sic Bo will actually be very easy to read. The first row of bets to check out is the Small and Big bets. The first type covers the numbers between 4 and 10, and the next one – the numbers between 10 and 17.</p>
<p>These bets have the smallest house edge, similar to roulette even/odds bets and they pay 1:1. However, if you bet on these bets, if you roll three of the same numbers, specifically 1-1-1 or 6-6-6, you will automatically lose.</p>
<p>This puts the overall house edge at around 48.61% – still a pretty decent outcome when you come to think!</p>
<p>Sic Bo also lets you bet on the sum totals of the three dice, with the numbers from 4 to 17. Once again, if the dice get 1-1-1 or 6-6-6 you will lose automatically as you cannot bet on either 3 or 17.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature of the game is the single-number bet – which covers the numbers from 1 to 6. If you get the same number once, you get paid out 1:1. If you get it on two dice, you get 2:1, and on three – a 3:1 payout.</p>
<p>Players can also bet on combination bets, which simply means that they want to guess the specific outcomes of two of the three dice. So, you can bet on 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and so on. There are 15 different combination bets you can try.</p>
<p>You also have the Double Bet, which is when two dice have the same value. Then, there are the Triple Bets, which means that you will get three of the same dice – or at least you think that this will be the case.</p>
<p>Alright, with this now clear and out of the way, it’s time to take a much closer look at what a good Sic Bo strategy looks like, and how you can leverage it to your ultimate advantage. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Sic Bo Strategy with the Best Winning Odds</p>
<p>There are many different approaches to the game of Sic Bo, and many casino Sic Bo strategy options for you to try out.</p>
<p>However, none of them is perfect, and what this means is that you will have to balance your bankroll, how much you are prepared to risk, and whether you are having a good or a bad day playing the game.</p>
<p>After all, Sic Bo is a game of chance and what this means is that you will not really be able to influence the outcome of the game as much as you like. Plus, remember that even the best Sic Bo strategy cannot change the fact that there is always a house edge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the house edge will always interfere with your chances of success. Even then, you can turn the game of Sic Bo into an entertaining and rewarding experience, especially if you are using a good strategy.</p>
<p>Does this mean you shouldn’t try your luck? Not at all. In fact, many people turn their Sic Bo sessions into small celebrations of success. Whether this happens to you will depend on a number of factors, including your ability to follow good Sic Bo strategies.</p>
<p>Here is how to boost your chances of winning at Sic Bo in the short to mid-term and walk away from the table with a smile on your face.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t Multi Bet, Have Focus</li>
</ol>
<p>Many players get tempted to try their luck at many of the selections. Although it’s fun to bet all over the Sic Bo table, it’s good to hold a little back and bid your timing. You want to get the best results coming your way rather than just some results.</p>
<p>If you bet on too many selections, chances are that many of these will g to waste and you would end up losing more of your bankroll than you would if you just focus on specific bets. Multiple bets can be fun, but it’s important to take several things into consideration.</p>
<p>For example, ask yourself, what are the odds of one or another bet actually winning? Does it make sense to bet on it, even if the payout is much better? You need to have a firm hand on your gameplay and focusing on fewer, safer selections could be just what makes sense for you the most!</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t Be (Too) Superstitious</li>
</ol>
<p>Many gamblers come to the tables bringing their own small rituals. A lucky tie, a good fortune charm, and who knows what else. Although these can be very good for calming you down and making you enjoy Sic Bo more, it’s important not to fall into the gambler’s fallacy.</p>
<p>That is the make-believe that just because a certain outcome hasn’t been produced on the table for a while, it’s likely to come next. No, this is not actually it. There is no way to know what the next outcome of a Sic Bo roll of the dice would be, and that is why you need to focus on what you know – and what not you believe would happen.</p>
<p>It’s important to approach a game of Sic Bo pragmatically. This way, you will leave as much of the randomness out of the game as possible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bet Big or Small Most of the Time</li>
</ol>
<p>This is perhaps the best piece of advice that you can receive when you play Sic Bo. Whether you love hitting the online or offline tables, the fact doesn’t change that Big and Small bets have the best odds.</p>
<p>The payout is 1:1 and there is a very small house edge all things considered. This fairly consistent payout will allow you to quickly adopt and use a specific Sic Bo strategy that can help you exert a little more control over your gameplay.</p>
<p>Of course, the drawback here is that you have to arm yourself with patience and remember that results will not follow too quickly. Small and Big bets are for the type of players who can wait a while before they amass a more respectable bankroll.</p>
<p>You can also change up your Sic Bo strategy to try to play for more money once you have got ahead a little.</p>
<p>This type of bet also allows you to use various gambling strategies, such as Martingale, Fibonacci, Labouchere, and others, precisely because they are very much like even/odd bets in roulette.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bankroll Management</li>
</ol>
<p>A universal piece of advice, bankroll management is one of the most important habits you can develop no matter what Sic Bo strategy you are using. You want to have a clear idea of what you are going to do next and why. This is why having a good grasp of your bankroll is always a good strategy.</p>
<p>Players who are keen to really make a difference in their fortunes will focus on developing good habits early into their learning of Sic Bo. The game really boils down to understanding the odds and probabilities of an outcome and combining this knowledge with sound bankroll management.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t Chase Your Losses</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps the most underrated Sic Bo strategy that you can use is to remind yourself that chasing your losses is a poor way to treat any of your gaming sessions. Instead, you need to remind yourself that bad beats do happen.</p>
<p>No Sic Bo strategy is perfect, and this means that you will sometimes run into situations where you are not making much progress. The best course of action is to take a break from the game and return when you are in a better mood and when luck smiles back on you again.</p>
<p>Sic Bo Strategy: Final Words</p>
<p>All in all, Sic Bo is an approachable and fun game. Picking a good Sic Bo strategy will make it even more so. Players are welcome to leverage any strategic tip they have read here and see if it works for them. The game isn’t designed to make you win 100% of the time, but if you are reasonable and exercise some restraint, you should be able to get the most out of your Sic Bo sessions without any issues!</p>
<p>FAQ</p>
<p>Is there a Sic Bo strategy that works 100% of the time? No, there is no Sic Bo strategy that will work 100% of the time. Strategies usually allow you to mitigate risk, and take advantage of specific patterns, but they are never designed to be flawless or guarantee you certain wins.
