<p>Parleh TV Toronto Offers Dedicated Multi-Sport News and Info</p>
<p>Founded earlier this year by Canadian digital media innovators, the Parleh Media Group quickly started making waves by providing top-quality content for sports fans. The company quickly established itself as the go-to source for sports betting news and insights in Canada.</p>
<p>Now, Parleh Media Group expanded its presence even further after announcing on Monday this week that it launched Parleh TV Toronto. This marks the first channel to offer dedicated multi-sport news as well as information in the city. As a result, the channel is already live and can be accessed by sports fans online for free. The channel will operate 24/7, and the announcement comes just in time for the upcoming start of the regular NBA season.</p>
