<p>The international sports marketing agency Sportfive and the award-winning sports betting and gaming operator VBet have announced a new agreement with the retired professional soccer player Laure Boulleau.</p>
<p>Boulleau Becomes VBet’s Brand Ambassador</p>
<p>As per the deal, the French women’s soccer star will become a brand ambassador for VBet. This is an unprecedented deal and will mark the first time a French sports betting operator has chosen a former female soccer player to become its brand representative. The move is part of VBet’s goals of promoting diversity and equality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Boulleau is a strategic choice as despite being retired, she remains one of the most popular and influential figures in women’s sports. The ex-football star boasts 1.7 million subscribers across all of her social media accounts.</p>
<p>Boulleau had a remarkable career as a French international and Paris Saint-Germain player and has vast experience that will be a valuable asset for inspiring VBet’s clients.</p>
<p>Boulleau herself spoke about her becoming a brand ambassador for VBet. She said that she is very happy and feels honored to become the first women’s football betting ambassador. Boulleau is glad to have chosen to partner with VBet and believes the two parties have a “wonderful adventure” ahead of themselves.</p>
<p>“We share the same vision of premium content and the desire to engage our respective communities.”</p>
<p>VBet Welcomes Boulleau</p>
<p>VBet’s choice of an ambassador was coordinated by Sportfive. The marketing agency’s managing director for France, Laurent Moretti, said that he is delighted to have accompanied VBet in this choice. Moretti added that the Sportfive team is glad to have taken part in the diversification of the sports betting sector.</p>
<p>“Our final choice was Laure Boulleau, a former French international football consultant who perfectly embodies the VBet values and DNA,” Moretti concluded.</p>
<p>David Ozararat, the chief executive officer of Softconstruct France and VBet Group, also spoke on the deal. He said that picking Boulleau was an easy choice and that the whole VBet team is proud to “have such an exemplary female athlete” as its ambassador. Ozararat continued by mentioning that Boulleau is an exemplary athlete and a sharp analyst with a profound knowledge of football at the highest level.</p>
<p>Ozararat concluded by promising VBet’s players that the deal with Boulleau will soon be the precedent for new “exclusive and innovative” experiences for the operator’s clients.</p>
<p>VBet recently acquired yet another football star as a brand ambassador by signing a deal with the Ukrainian athlete Oleksandr Zinchenko.</p>
