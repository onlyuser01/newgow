    <h1>Hardrock Casino Hollywood Closest Casino To Nashville Tn L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Avenue</h1>

<p>Australian sports betting and iGaming operator PlayUp has teamed up with provider of payment solutions Paysafe to power up its offering in regulated gaming and sports betting markets. PlayUp, which has launched betting products in New Jersey and Colorado, will now benefit from Paysafe’s advanced payment offering.</p>
<p>Empowering Players Through Payments Solutions</p>
<p>Paysafe should reinforce PlayUp’s banking process putting an emphasis on the customer and allowing players in the Garden State and the Centennial State to benefit from flexible payment options.</p>
<p>The sportsbook will further benefit from a stronger acquisition program powered by Income Access developed by Paysafe. PlayUp USA CEO Dr Laila Mintas stressed the importance to work with world-class suppliers as the company is looking to expand aggressively in new markets:</p>
<p>“As a premium brand entering into a very competitive marketplace, it is crucial for us to partner with leading and world-class suppliers. Paysafe is key for us in meeting our regulatory and compliance standards but also providing our customers with a simple, safe, and secure payment gateway.”</p>
<p>As a result, players can use a comprehensive suite of depositing options that make it easy for players to access through all desktop or mobile devices. PlayUp made big strides in the US market this year, breaking ground in Colorado back in March and following up on a market access partnership with the New Jersey Devil, an NHL franchise, in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Tapping into Advanced Marketing Experience</p>
<p>PlayUp has evolved this partnership into a fully-scaled launch of its sports betting offering in New Jersey after receiving an official go-ahead by regulators earlier in October. Paysafe brings a diverse variety of payment options, featuring credit and debit card payments, including the Skrill USA digital wallet and prepaid Paysafecard voucher.</p>
<p>Paysafe powers up a range of payout options as well, making it easy for PlayUp customers to cash out their winnings quickly and without incurring additional fees. The payment provider argued in a Q4 2020 study that its payment products are associated with better acquisition and retention metrics for partners.</p>
<p>Paysafe CEO of North America iGaming Zark Cutler welcomed the opportunity to be assisting PlayUp as the company expands and continues to build upon its operations in New Jersey and Colorado. Cutler expressed confidence that Paysafe’s unified payment solutions combined with the marketing nous of Income Access would yield great results for PlayUp and help it amplify its offer in established and fresh US gaming markets.</p>
<p>PlayUp is also tapping into the affiliate software provided by Income Access and its marketing team. Through Income Access’ specialists’ know-how, PlayUp is expecting to see a higher rate of acquiring and retaining customers as well as optimize its product offerings to better cater to individual state preferences. PlayUp’s affiliate program is set to launch in Q4.</p>
<p>The sports betting operator also just struck a market access partnership for its iGaming products in Iowa, as Iowa could soon be considering introducing more gaming verticals that PlayUp would be happy to follow up on.</p>
