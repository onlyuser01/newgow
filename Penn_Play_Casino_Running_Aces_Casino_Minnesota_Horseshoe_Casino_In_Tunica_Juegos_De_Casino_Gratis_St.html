<p>Supplier of sports betting technology and services Kambi Group announced today that it has signed an agreement with Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort in Hot Springs, Arkansas, to power the retail and online sports betting offering of the Thoroughbred racetrack and casino.</p>
<p>Replace CDI’s Sports Betting Arrangement</p>
<p>The agreement between Kambi Group and Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort will see the B2B sport betting technology provider power the launch of the resort’s online sportsbook operations under the ‘Oaklawn Sports’ brand with Kambi’s best-in-class digital betting solutions including BetBuilder and same game and multi-game product.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership, Kristian Nylén, chief executive officer and co-founder of Kambi, expressed his excitement at the opportunity to strengthen the relationship with the racetrack and casino in Arkansas and subsequently extend the partnership into the mobile space.</p>
<p>“The combination of Kambi’s advanced technology and Oaklawn’s reputation as one of the premier Thoroughbred tracks and casinos in the US makes this an enticing sports betting proposition,” concluded Nylén.</p>
<p>Kambi has been powering Oaklawn’s retail sportsbook with sports betting technology via a partnership with Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) since 2021 and the agreement today will replace the CDI arrangement and will see the sports betting tech supplier continue to offer its solutions directly to the racetrack and casino while also extend the duration of the deal.</p>
<p>Extend Partnership to Oaklawn Sports</p>
<p>Oaklawn is also planning to expand its retail sports betting operations and create new exciting experiences for its visitors during the Thoroughbred races.</p>
<p>Hailing the destination as “one of the most trusted brands in Arkansas for more than 100 years,” Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort general manager Wayne Smith outlined the much-anticipated mobile wagering platform under the new agreement as “another great amenity” for the racetrack and casino’s loyal customers, looking forward to “delivering the best online sports wagering experience” in the state.</p>
<p>The agreement with Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort is the latest in a series of deals for the sports gambling tech provider with gambling establishments in the US.</p>
<p>At the end of June, Kambi extended its existing sportsbook partnership with the owner of the largest casino complex in Pennsylvania, Parx Casino, and betPARX, Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment.</p>
<p>Under the extended agreement, Kambi will continue to provide its valued partner since 2018 with its best-in-class technology and services, including the BetBuilder product, across multiple US states.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Kambi signed an agreement with Buenos Aires-based developer of online gaming platforms Ondiss to expand its footprint in the Latin American region by powering with sports betting solutions Argentine gaming operators BetWarrior, Casino Club and Casino Magic.</p>
