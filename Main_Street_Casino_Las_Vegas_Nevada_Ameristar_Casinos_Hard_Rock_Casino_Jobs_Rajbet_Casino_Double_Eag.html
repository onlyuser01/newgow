<p>Relax Gaming and Its Partners Anchor Down in the Netherlands</p>
<p>Relax Gaming, an aggregator and supplier of award-winning iGaming content, has announced its debut in the Netherlands. The market entry is just another step for the company towards establishing itself in the regulated European gaming landscape.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Launches Its iGaming Portfolio in the Netherlands</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is not alone in its expansion into the Dutch market, as it will be accompanied by its 24 studio partners that are part of the company’s distribution efforts through the Powered By Relax and Silver Bullet programs.</p>
<p>The company is bringing its market-leading suite after the platform was fully certified by the country’s regulator, the Netherlands Gambling Authority (NGA), as fitting the newly-regulated market’s standards and expectations.</p>
<p>Alexia Smilovic-Ronde, chief regulatory officer at Relax Gaming, has expressed her delight in achieving this critical milestone for the company, stating, “We believe this will be a highly valuable and successful market entry for all associated parties as we provide our best-in-class product suite and unique concepts to players in the Netherlands.”</p>
<p>According to Smilovic-Ronde, success is only a continuation of the drive that underpins the company’s “hard-earned reputation for driving differentiation in the industry.”</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Shows Consistency in Global Approach</p>
<p>In May, Relax Gaming received a UK license through its Gibraltar subsidiary and made its British debut, thus entering one of the biggest markets in the world. Earlier this month, the company used this license to sign a content deal with British operator William Hill. That allowed Relax’s content to be accessible to British players through the William Hill online platform.</p>
<p>The company is also keen on developing further in the Nordics and, earlier this year, the aggregator received the EGR Nordics Casino Content Supplier award.</p>
<p>In March, Relax Gaming collaborated with another major iGaming operator, Parimatch, to add unique content from more than 50 third-party studios. A similar deal was also signed with PokerStars at the end of August.</p>
<p>The Relax Gaming Brand and Success Story</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is a content producer with more than 2,000 online casino games in its portfolio and a long line of trophies and awards for many of them. Relax’s portfolio includes a wide range of titles, from high-performing slots to an extensive content catalog full of carefully chosen third-party studios by Relax’s partnership programs.</p>
<p>In February of this year, the producer won the “Casino Content Supplier” 2021 EGR Award. In July, the company received four significant awards from the London-held 2021 EGR B2B Awards – Casino Software Supplier, Innovation in Mobile, Poker Supplier and Bingo Supplier.</p>
<p>At last year’s EGR B2B 2020 Awards, Relax Gaming also won the “Casino Software Supplier.”</p>
