    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa Casino Casino In Indianapolis Boomtown</h1>

<p>Mohegan Casino Las Vegas has celebrated its two-year anniversary as part of Nevadaâ€™s gambling landscape by revealing a new partnership with Virgin Voyages to offer Momentum Rewards Members the ability to play and earn a Virgin Voyages cruise.</p>
<p>This partnership will seek to empower both the hospitality and gaming verticals for the casino, bringing new entertainment options for guests and members of the program. Mohegan CasinoLas VegasGeneral ManagerJoe Hasson welcomed the new opportunity to bolster the consumer experience and said:</p>
<p>"We are always looking at new and unique ways to connect with our casino guests. This partnership with Virgin Voyages is truly a one-of-a-kind experience, and a first to Las Vegas experience."</p>
<p>To celebrate the start of this new initiative, Mohegan Casino Las Vegas and Virgin Voyages will now be giving away five free seven-night Mediterranean Cruise voyages. In order to enter the giveaway, guests would need to have a Momentum account and claim their drawing tickets through June 16-17, the official press release details. The draw will then take place on June 17 at 8:00 pm on the casino floor.</p>
<p>Participants who wish to win would need to be there in person to be deemed eligible for the reward. Mohegan Casino Director of Casino, Strategy and Partnerships, Jennifer Wengert, was similarly excited at the opportunity to see this partnership shape up.</p>
<p>This way, the companies have the opportunity to share the ship experience with casino guests. "From our adults-only offering and elevated backdrop, to our commitment to incredible service, we see our beautiful lady ships as a seamless transition from the casino floor to playing on the high seas," Wengert added.</p>
<p>Mohegan is one of the most prominent casino operators in the United States and beyond. The company owns, develops, and manages properties across North America, including the United States and Canada. In the United States in particular, the company is present in Pennsylvania, NewJersey, Washington, Connecticut, and Nevada.</p>
<p>Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment, the operator of Mohegan Suncasino, became the first Native American tribal company to expand in the Silver State and focus on the gambling industry. In the meantime, the Momentum Rewards Program remains available to players who wish to elevate their experience by visiting the Mohegan Casino Las Vegas inside the Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, part of the Curio Collection by Hilton.</p>
<p>Mohegan was recently also recognized as one of the top 100 global most loved workplaces, a list put together by Newsweek.</p>
