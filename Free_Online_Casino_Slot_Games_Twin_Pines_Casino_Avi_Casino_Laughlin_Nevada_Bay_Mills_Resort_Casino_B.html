<p>Encore Boston Harbor is making it easier to get to the new Everett, Massachusetts casino, with free self-parking for guests seven days a week. That is in contrast to many properties in Las Vegas now charge gamblers parking fees.</p>

<p>With the no-charge policy starting last Friday, it is also a welcome change for drivers from pricey paid parking. Previously, the cost to park in the Encore’s garage was $22 for up to six hours, and it was $42 for each full day.</p>
<p>Initially, management of the Wynn Resorts property urged patrons to take public transportation, ferries ,or shuttles to reach the venue.</p>
<p>There are 2,900 parking spots in the Encore’s garage, which MassLive.com reports is, on average, insufficient to provide every driver with a place to park.</p>
<p>Free self-parking is an amenity not frequently found in the Boston region. For instance, the Boston Common Garage, located underneath the large park in downtown Boston, typically charges between $12 and $32 weekdays for parking, and weekend and holiday rates are between $10 and $18.</p>
<p>The Government Center Garage asks for between $8 and $39 for parking on weekdays. Evenings and weekends are less expensive, with the flat fee being $15.</p>
<p>Free self-parking is an amenity that is highly appreciated by all of our guests,” Robert DeSalvio, president of Encore Boston Harbor, said in a statement. “After a very successful weekday introduction, we are pleased to now offer free self-parking seven days a week to show how thankful we are to be Greater Boston’s hometown casino.”</p>
<p>There are plenty of casino-goers and other guests who will take advantage of the free offer. In August, the Encore Boston Harbor reported gross gaming revenue (GGR) of more than $52.48 million.</p>
<p>The venue’s 210,000-square-foot gaming area has more than 3,000 slot machines and 240 table games. There are also 671 hotel rooms, as well as multiple stores, restaurants, bars, and expansive meeting space.</p>
<p>In a statement to Casino.org, Massachusetts Gaming Commission spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll said, “Encore has successfully instituted a series of transportation demand measures, including shuttles, buses, and ferries. They are subject to rigorous transportation monitoring.</p>
<p>“If reviews were to identify deficiencies in meeting environmental goals, additional measures could be contemplated, such as parking pricing strategies,” Driscoll added.</p>
<p>Regional Competitors Provide Free Parking</p>
<p>Some other regional competitors already offer free parking — including MGM Springfield — are located almost 100 miles west of the Encore Boston Harbor.</p>
<p>Connecticut’s Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun also do not charge for parking. But they are in more remote areas.</p>
<p>Still, casino-goers weighing their options on which major casino to visit in New England will no longer have to worry about parking charges.</p>
<p>Many Las Vegas Casinos Charge for Self-Parking</p>
<p>Compare it also to The Strip in the Las Vegas region, where many guests are finding an increasing number of extra fees. Once-available free parking has been eliminated at some casinos, such as MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment properties.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts had followed suit. But officials had a change of heart and restored free self-parking in April. As of now, self-parking is free to guests at The Venetian and The Palazzo, too. Both are owned and operated by Las Vegas Sands.</p>
<p>Many properties in Las Vegas let drivers park for free up to one hour. But then fees kick in.</p>
<p>For instance, at MGM’s MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Park MGM, Mirage and New York-New York, the self-parking fee is $12 for vehicles parked between one and four hours. It is $15 for vehicles parked from four to 24 hours.</p>
<p>For vehicles parked at these venues over 24 hours, there is an additional self-parking fee of $15 for each additional day.</p>
