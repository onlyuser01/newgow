<p>Todd Pletcher’s Horses Favored to Win the 2023 Kentucky Derby</p>
<p>Todd Pletcher is widely considered one of the greatest horse trainers in history. The proof of this is that two of the horses he’s been training are seen as the two top favorites to win the 2023 Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>The first one is Forte, the winner of the G1 Florida Derby. In that race, Forte got the Bayer Speed Figure rating of 95. Not too impressive, one may argue, as that’s the lowest number recorded by the previous Kentucky Derby winners.</p>
<p>However, the fact is that Forte does have it in him to produce higher numbers. Actually, the three-year-old colt recorded 100 at the G1 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile race.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Kentucky Derby 2023 second-favorite, Tapit Trice is coming off a big win at the Grade 1 Blue Grass a month ago. According to his trainer, this horse is improving all the time. Does this mean the next step in his journey is winning the race at Churchill Downs?</p>
<p>2023 Kentucky Derby Prediction</p>
<p>Historically, the post that’s produced the most Kentucky Derby winners is the No. 5 post. Ten horses that run from this post ended up passing the finish line before anyone else in the last 93 races.</p>
<p>Guess which horse got the No. 5 post position in Monday’s draw? Tapit Trice is the answer. That’s one on a long list of reasons why we think this grey colt has a great chance of triumphing on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pick: Tapit Trace to win</p>
