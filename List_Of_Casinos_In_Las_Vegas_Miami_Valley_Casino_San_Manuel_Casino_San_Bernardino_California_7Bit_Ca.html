    <h1>List Of Casinos In Las Vegas Miami Valley Casino San Manuel Casino San Bernardino California 7Bit Ca</h1>

<p>Dear cmanson81,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gaming section on the website, and this is what I found https://www.yeticasino.com/responsible-gaming/:</p>
<p>„Full Exclusion:</p>
<p>All clients of Yeti Casino reserve the right to exclude themselves at any given period of time from any casino activity. The exclusion process can be done by adjusting the "lock account" option to "forever", therefore resulting in the closure of the casino account.</p>
<p>Important - Clients must always remember that once an account is fully excluded, all pending balances will be lost and the account cannot be reopened."</p>
<p>https://www.yeticasino.com/en/terms:</p>
<p>„A player can instruct us to exclude him or her from making use of the gaming services for a specific period of time (from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 5 years) by contacting Customer Services. In asking Customer Services to exclude a player from Yeticasino.com and our Services, a player acknowledges and agrees that we will block that player’s Account from placing gambling transactions for the period requested, starting as soon as possible after receipt of your request (and, in any event, no later than the next time a player tries and logs in). The self-exclusion will be applied to all websites operated by us and members of our Group (please note that there may be a short delay in applying the self-exclusion to websites operated by other members of our Group)."</p>
<p>Is this support@yeticasino.com the email address to which you have sent your emails?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
