    <h1>San Diego Casino Hotels New Casino Sites Soundtrack To Casino Meskwaki Bingo Casino Tama Salary For</h1>

<p>EngageCraft, a provider of innovative digital fan engagement solutions to global and national sports federations, leagues, clubs, media, broadcasters, sports data and betting businesses, joined forces with Racecourse Media Group (RMG). The deal will see the companies leverage EngageCraft’s Touch platform to deliver new fan engagement solutions.</p>
<p>As per the agreement, RMG will help EngageCraft develop various gamification widgets that boost the engagement of sports fans and sports bettors. Thanks to EngageCraft Touch, the provider’s partners will be able to quickly and seamlessly integrate the solutions into their platforms.</p>
<p>EngageCraft and RMG announced that their first project will soon hit the market. The two companies’ first release will be a Pick 5 game that will go live on racingtv.com later this week. The game will launc in time for the Qatar Goodwood Festival thanks to a partnership with Paddy Power, a global gambling operator.</p>
<p>RMG plans to capitalize on EngageCraft’s Touch platform to boost racingtv.com and set things up for future partnerships. Speaking of the platform, EngageCraft launched Touch last year as a self-serve solution. EngageCraft’s partners can use Touch to quickly create content by using integrated data feeds and preset templates. Touch, therefore, allows partners to quickly integrate data feeds and engaging games into their offering.</p>
<p>EngageCraft Is Honored to Work with RMG</p>
<p>Damon Russell, director of EngageCraft, said that it is a “huge honor” to be able to work with RMG. Russell welcomed the new partner to the Touch platform and said that he is looking forward to working with its team.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with the group and its partners to drive audience growth, data, insight and revenues across the race calendar; and to demonstrating the efficiency, speed and flexibility of the EngageCraft Touch platform. Damon Russel, director, EngageCraft</p>
<p>Clive Cottrell, marketing director of RMG, also spoke about the partnership. He said that his team is glad to have EngageCraft by its side. According to Cottrell, RMG’s goal now is to roll out more fun and innovative engagement products.</p>
<p>Cottrell praised Touch, noting that the platform allowed RMG’s project to be realized in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>We believe the tools will help us grow and know our racing audiences better, while also delivering the first-party data and new digital commercial inventory which is becoming ever more important to our business. Clive Cottrell, marketing director, RMG</p>
<p>Fan engagement is becoming increasingly important in sports and sports betting. Because of this, numerous companies have been striking deals with tech leaders such as EngageCraft. Two weeks ago, SSG and Sky Bet also joined forces. The latter two agreed to launch a soccer micro-site to boost engagement among Premier League fans.</p>
