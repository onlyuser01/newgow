    <h1>Casino No Deposit Welcome Bonus Resorts Casino Catskills Wow Casino No Deposit Bonus Foxwoods Casino</h1>

<p>I can see your point of view and what you describe is true. However, we do not have the power to financially fine casinos or revoke their licenses. We provide information about casinos and we try to make sure that players don't get somewhere where they might get into an unpleasant situation just for playing there. We can add black points to casinos if they are not interested in solving players' problems, which lowers their safety index. Players can then look up information about the casino based on that. The lower the safety index, the more unsafe the casino is for the player, I would say.</p>
<p>Anyway, I accept that bad advertising is probably not enough, but information can be found everywhere nowadays. Since we also provide them, I think that every player can decide on the basis of them whether it is suitable for him to deposit in a casino. I always recommend doing your research and gathering as much information about a casino as possible before you decide to play there. This is not to say that there can't be a problem in a casino with a better safety index. But I do think that there might be less chance of something negative happening.</p>
<p>I hope I have made myself clear and helped to clarify the situation.</p>
