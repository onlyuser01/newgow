<p>Thunderkick is now an ally of most of the tier 1 and tier 2 gambling operators in Sweden, solidifying its presence in the country</p>
<p>Thunderkick, an independent developer of slot games, has strengthened its presence in Sweden after expanding its partnerships with the Bethard and Fastbet brands. The deal will help the supplier further consolidate its presence in its home market.</p>
<p>Under the expanded agreements, Thunderkick will continue to supply its loyal partners with games, including hot new releases. As a result, Swiss players will get to play esteemed fan favorites such as Dionysus Golden Feast and the Esqueleto Explosivo series, as well as the recently-released Jiggly Cash.</p>
<p>The deal extensions are very important to Thunderkick, considering that Bethard and Fastbet are two of the fastest-growing gambling companies in Europe. Both brands are part of the Bethard Group and have a presence in several key European markets.</p>
<p>The Bethard brand is extra ambitious about growing its business and becoming “the world’s best sportsbook.”</p>
<p>Bethard Group Enjoys Working with Thunderkick</p>
<p>Thunderkick is now an ally of most of the tier 1 and tier 2 gambling operators in Sweden. The agreements with Bethard and Fastbet solidify its position as a top supplier in the country.</p>
<p>The partnership extensions were addressed by Thunderkick’s head of sales, Fredrik Ekholm, who noted that Sweden is understandably a key market for his team. Because of that, the provider is thrilled to expand its existing agreements with Bethard and Fastbet in the region.</p>
<p>Ekholm lauded the two brands as local leaders and said that he cannot wait to supply them with more games.</p>
<p>These are two of the most exciting operators in Europe and with strong player bases in the Swedish market, we’re thrilled to be bringing our games to even more players in our homeland! Fredrik Ekholm, head of sales, Thunderkick</p>
<p>Tom Forsberg, Bethard Group’s head of casino, also commented on the agreement. He said that his team has so far enjoyed a very successful partnership with Thunderkick. Because of that, Bethard Group is excited to expand the deal and offer the developer’s content to Bethard and Fastbet customers in Sweden.</p>
<p>Their portfolio of games is truly impressive, with some player-favorite titles that we’re thrilled to bring to more customers. We look forward to continued success and growth with Thunderkick. Tom Forsberg, head of casino, Bethard Group</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the developer penned similar agreements with REEVO, Vana Lauri and Interwetten. Last year, Thunderkick was added to Relax Gaming’s Powered By Relax aggregation platform, further expanding the developer’s reach.</p>
<p>In February 2023, on the other hand, EEG decided to sell the Bethard brand as it sought to reduce its outstanding debts.</p>
