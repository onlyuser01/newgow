<p>We did great with our Formula 1 predictions for the last race (and the one before) and we’re certain our F1 picks for the June 18 event will do great as well</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Max Verstappen won his fifth win of the season, which came as no surprise as the reigning F1 champ has been brilliant in 2023. Are we going to see the Dutchman prolong his brilliant run for one more race? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>2023 Formula 1 is All About Max Verstappen</p>
<p>The main favorite to win the 2023 Canadian Grand Prix is Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing, which is no surprise to anyone. The winner of the 2022 Drivers’ Championship has already won five races this season (out of a possible seven), ending up on the podium in every event in 2023.</p>
<p>The Dutchman won each of the last three F1 races, including last weekend’s Spanish GP. It was one of his best performances this season. Not only did he win the race, but Verstappen also won the pole position and had the fastest lap.</p>
<p>If all this wasn’t enough to persuade you that bookies are right to think of him as the No. 1 Canadian GP favorite, here’s another fact – Verstappen is the one who won this race last year.</p>
<p>This makes him one of only two winners who are taking part in the 2023 F1 season. If you’re wondering who’s the other one, it’s Lewis Hamilton.</p>
<p>Has Lewis Hamilton’s Resurgence Started?</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton is tied first on the list of repeat winners of the Canadian Grand Prix (tied with Michael Schumacher). The seven-time Formula 1 champ won this event the last time in 2019 but is hopeful he could do it again.</p>
<p>What’s feeding his fans with confidence is that he’s upped his form a lot since the start of the season. The first two races saw him finish fifth, but he then got onto the podium in Australia, finishing second. Then, he had another three races in which he finished outside the top 3. Last weekend, however, we saw him finish second in Spain.</p>
<p>He finished +24.090 after Verstappen, but the Englishman probably feels as if he could’ve done even better. And he would’ve done if it weren’t for the contact with Lando Norris’s car on the first corner, which damaged his front wing.</p>
<p>2023 Canadian GP Predictions</p>
<p>It’s 2023 and we just can’t go against Max Verstappen in Formula 1. He’s the favorite and we’re almost certain he’s going to win. But, if the impossible happens, who’s gonna take the No. 1 spot?</p>
<p>We think there’s a chance of Lewis Hamilton being the one to upset the odds. Still, we do think it’s a much safer bet backing Hamilton to finish on the podium once again. Bookies are giving F1 odds in the ballpark of +125 for this bet.</p>
<p>Picks: Max Verstappen to win; Lewis Hamilton to finish in the top 3</p>
