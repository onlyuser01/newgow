    <h1>South Point Casino Dania Beach Casino Online Casino Blackjack Casinos In Baltimore Maryland Tulsa Ca</h1>

<p>Hi, everyone,</p>
<p>I don't know if the question is in the right subforum, in any case I just don't know what to do anymore, the story:</p>
<p>A few years ago I had gambling problems, then I had some of the money I gambled on at online casinos (which was paid for with Paypal) reclaimed via a lawyer from the site mentioned via "wirholdeeingeldr√ºck".</p>
<p>So far so good, I got my money back from Paypal, my lawyer paid a percentage, the collection agency from Paypal (I think Paigo is Paigo) warned me and made demands for a few more months, but these were then discontinued and I had my money back.</p>
<p>That was in 2019!!!</p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<p>Since then I've been blocked by Paypal and the payment (approx. 1.5K) is still open with them. For a long time I didn't care, but now I really need Paypal..</p>
<p>The lawyer I did it with said that he had reclaimed the money from countless clients via Paypal and in 99% of the cases there were no longer any problems after a while (since these Paypal payments were "illegitimate" at the time, what was also the reason why PayPal withdrew from this area and the debt collection company also stopped contacting me after a while / made new demands)</p>
<p>I wanted to ask if anyone has experience with this?</p>
<p>Did someone also make a successful cashback back then, but has since been blocked at PayPal?</p>
<p>Because as far as I've noticed, I'm one of the only ones who have been banned for years.</p>
<p>The problem is I absolutely need Paypal privately + for work and the whole thing is really very annoying, I've already made countless phone calls to the unfriendly Paypal/Paigo support but they strictly refuse to unblock me again.</p>
<p>That's why I decided to register here and ask about your experiences, you are my last hope.</p>
<p>Many greetings</p>
<p>Rexo</p>
