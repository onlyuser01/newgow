    <h1>Grand Bay Casino Durant Oklahoma Casino Casino Coushatta New Hampshire Casinos Riverside Casino Rive</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Flush is delaying my verification for many weeks now...</p>
<p>Everytime I must ask them 2-3 days on chat to eventually get response to my e-mail - this is so frustrating...</p>
<p>It started with standard kyc - id, bank statement, selfie with date and note 'I play at flush' and I've sent all of these same day. They approved but asked to send bank statement in english which was a problem for me because my bank says they do not do this in english but finally I've used other bank and got statement in english. Same story - 2-3 days on chat and now they replied</p>
<p>'Well received with thanks.</p>
<p>Can you certify this document at the Notary service with a legal person in your country.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving the document.</p>
<p>Thankyou</p>
<p>Flush Support Team'</p>
<p>Which is way too much IMO to notarize documents for kyc verification - it's first time I see something like this and I'm not accepting this kind of cooperation with me - they are doing everything to not pay me.</p>
<p>Can You help me to solve this?</p>
<p>Everyone should read this - they want notarized documents for kyc which is not acceptable at all.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
