<p>Macau Junket Suncity to Operate Casino at Planned Philippine Mega-Resort</p>

<p>Junket giant Suncity is set to continue its transition from middleman to major international casino operator through a new deal that will see it manage the gaming operations of the Philippines integrated resort project, Westside City Resorts World.</p>

<p>The junket operator announced Tuesday that it had acquired a majority stake in a Philippines-listed company called Suntrust Home Developers Inc.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Suntrust said it had agreed a deal to operate Westside’s casino and main hotel, which is one of several hotels planned for the complex.</p>
<p>The long-awaited Westside City — a working title — is currently under construction in Entertainment City, a special economic zone in Parañaque in Metro Manila, which also houses the Solaire Resort &amp; Casino, the City of Dreams Manila, and the Okada Manila.</p>
<p>The resort is scheduled to open in 2024 as a sprawling gaming, hospitality, and entertainment complex, with a complicated ownership structure that will now include Suncity — subject to the approval of Philippines financial regulators.</p>
<p>Rise of a Junket</p>
<p>Ignoring the complicated mesh of subsidiaries, Westside is ultimately a joint venture between Malaysian casino giant Genting and Philippines conglomerate Alliance Global Group Inc, which is owned by Filipino billionaire Andrew Tan. Together, they are known as Travellers International.</p>
<p>Under CEO Alvin Chau, Suncity has grown from a company that organized trips and lent money to Chinese high rollers to gamble at a single high-stakes table at the Wynn Macau back in 2007 into a multibillion-dollar conglomerate.</p>
<p>Suncity employs thousands of people and has interests in everything from property to film production — a testament to the crazy money the super-wealthy Chinese were willing to blow at Macau’s VIP baccarat tables in 2007.</p>
<p>The company’s operating ambitions extend to its recent purchase of a controlling stake in the $4 billion “Hoiana” integrated resort in Vietnam, which is scheduled to open later this year, as well as in Russia’s first integrated resort, Tigre de Cristal, near Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Suncity Scrutiny</p>
<p>But Suncity has had a challenging 2019. In July, the company become the focus of Chinese state media, which accused it of operating a multibillion-dollar online gambling operation based in Cambodia and the Philippines. The operation allegedly targeted customers on the Chinese mainland, where gambling is illegal.</p>
<p>A negative mention in Chinese state media is often a chilling precursor to punitive action by the Chinese government — and, significantly, it came shortly after Suncity had registered an interest in applying for a gaming license in Macau.</p>
<p>The message was clear — there will be no gambling license in Macau for Suncity. And while Chau denied the online gaming allegations, he issued a grovelling apology for upsetting the Politburo in Beijing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, questions will always linger about the origins of the junket industry, which grew from organized crime. The level of influence triad societies have within the junkets today is a matter of debate.</p>
<p>Chau himself has been accused by Australian authorities and the Hong Kong Jockey Club of being a member of Hong Kong’s 14K triads.</p>
<p>These allegations have recently resurfaced in the Australian press, which is scrutinizing the Crown Resorts relationship with Suncity and other junket groups.</p>
