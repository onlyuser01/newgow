<p>After a two-week break, the Premier League returns this weekend. Round 22 of the 2022-23 EPL season kicks off on Friday with the Chelsea vs Fulham game</p>
<p>Although it‚Äôs not the biggest of London Derbies, the second Chelsea vs Fulham clash of 2023 is going to be a spicey one. It‚Äôs because the Blues are flying surprisingly low, while it‚Äôs just the opposite when it comes to the Cottagers.</p>

<p>Is It Time for a Chelsea Surge?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been a rough couple of months for Chelsea, but good days seem to be on the horizon. Since Todd Boehly took over the club, the Blues have spent crazy amounts of money on transfers, which is bound to pay off at some point.</p>
<p>Chelsea have now spent $533M in just two transfer windows under Todd Boehly üí∞</p>
<p>That's more than double what any other club have spent in that time üò≥ pic.twitter.com/uYL2Q5kf08 ‚Äî ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) January 29, 2023</p>
<p>They‚Äôre currently sitting in the 10th position, but it would only take a couple of wins for them to join the race for one of the ‚ÄúEuro‚Äù spots.</p>
<p>On paper, their form isn‚Äôt great ‚Äì they‚Äôre 1-2-2 in the Premier League since the start of 2023. However, the fact is that they played against some really tough opponents in January, including Manchester City and Liverpool.</p>
<p>They did, however, drop points to teams like Nottingham (draw) and Fulham (loss). Such disappointing results mustn‚Äôt happen anymore if Chelsea want to challenge for a Top 6 place.</p>
<p>Can Fulham Surprise Chelsea Once Again?</p>
<p>In their first clash of the year, Fulham beat Chelsea 2-1 at Craven Cottage. However, no one can say they were the better team that day. Chelsea had way more goal chances, but only one of them went it. The reason behind that is not just that Fulham‚Äôs defense did great. It‚Äôs also because Chelsea‚Äôs offense was pretty anemic.</p>
<p>With several of Chelsea‚Äôs forwards out injured (or out of form), Kai Havertz and Joao Feliz started as the front two in that game. The Blues went 1-0 up at the start of the second half, but Felix got a red card just before the one-hour mark, and everything went downhill from there.</p>
<p>Fulham cannot rely on luck again; instead, they need to give their best on Friday with the hopes of winning at least one point. Their defense looks decent, but their attackers haven‚Äôt been great since the start of the year. For instance, they failed to score a single goal in their last two EPL games ‚Äì against Newcastle and Tottenham.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs Fulham Prediction</p>
<p>Chelsea have the defense that can stop Fulham‚Äôs forwards, but what about Chelsea‚Äôs offense? They haven‚Äôt been great so far ‚Äì scoring no more than a goal per game in 2023 ‚Äì but the fact is that there‚Äôs plenty of talent in the Blues‚Äô attacking department.</p>
<p>Sure, some of them will miss this game (Joao Felix, Armando Broja, Raheem Sterling, and Christian Pulisic), but others (Mykhailo Murdyk, Kai Havertz, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hakim Ziyech, and others) are fit and ready to go.</p>
<p>Pick: Chelsea to win to nil</p>
