<p>Huge interest saw tickets for the inaugural event in the country sold out in a matter of hours after the announcement</p>
<p>Online sports betting and gaming operator, Superbet, announced it has been named title sponsor of the 2023 Superbet Poland Darts Masters scheduled to take place next week.</p>
<p>Logo Featuring on Players and On-Stage</p>
<p>The selection of Superbet as title sponsor of the inaugural edition of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC)’s World Series of Darts will see the operator’s logo displayed on competing players and on-stage during the event taking place on July 7-8 at COS Torwar in Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p>Commenting on the sponsorship, Superbet Poland’s chief executive officer, Lukasz Seweryniak, was delighted to partner with PDC and support “the first prestigious World Series of Darts event” in Poland.</p>
<p>“We want to support dynamically developing sports disciplines and help them gain fans’ interest and popularity, and darts fits perfectly into our plans,” Seweryniak said, hailing the collaboration as a display of Superbet’s continuous efforts to seek “innovative solutions in both sponsorship and technological endeavors.”</p>
<p>Visitors to the 2023 Superbet Poland Darts Masters will witness an epic battle in which eight of PDC’s star players will take on eight players from Eastern Europe, promising the crowd an exciting experience and fun.</p>
<p>Meet the Players from Both Teams</p>
<p>The team from East Europe will be spearheaded by world number 19, Krzysztof Ratajski, and comprise fellow country and PDC professionals, Krzysztof Kciuk and Radek Szaganski, as well as one qualifier who will be determined on July 1, two from the Czech Republic, Adam Gawlas and Karel Sedlacek, Croatia’s Boris Krcmar, and Hungary’s qualifier Nandor Major.</p>
<p>The eight PDC stars will be led by World Champion, Michael Smith, and last month’s US Darts Masters winner in New York and Dutch legend, Michael van Gerwen, and will also feature former World Champions, Gerwyn Price and Rob Cross, Premier League duo, Dimitri Van den Bergh and Nathan Aspinall, former UK Open champion, Danny Noppert, and world number six, Luke Humphries.</p>
<p>“It gives us great pleasure to welcome Superbet as an official partner of the Poland Darts Masters,” commented PDC’s chief executive officer Matt Porter.</p>
<p>“We’ve received an amazing reaction since announcing that the World Series would visit Warsaw, with tickets selling out in hours and great anticipation for the biggest darts event ever held in Poland,” he added.</p>
<p>Streaming and Broadcast Options</p>
<p>Residents of Poland, the Netherlands and the Nordic &amp; Baltic region will be able to watch the event streamed on Viaplay, while the rest of the world will rely on the broadcast from PDC’s partners, ITV in the UK, DAZN and PDCTV.</p>
<p>The title sponsorship of the event will boost Superbet’s brand awareness in the country the brand operates since 2017, offering online betting, slot games, live casino, virtual games and lottery.</p>
<p>It comes during times when the brand that was once awarded as the “Best Sports Betting Operator in Central &amp; Eastern Europe” is mainly busy with leadership changes, creating a team of talent and industry veterans.</p>
