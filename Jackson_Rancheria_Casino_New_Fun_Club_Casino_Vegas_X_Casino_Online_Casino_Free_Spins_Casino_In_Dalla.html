<p>SPIELO G2 Chosen for Ontario Real-Money Site</p>

<p>SPIELO G2’s Boss Media AB has been chosen by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation to power its PlayOLG.ca site as it makes the move from an information-only site to a real money online gambling site this year.</p>
<p>The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation plans to make the move to the real money offering in stages, first with lottery products, slots and casino table games, and eventually adding online poker, bingo and, (if the law allows), sports betting services, as well as other online gambling activities.</p>
<p>Five-Year Term</p>
<p>The initial deal between the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and SPIELO G2 sees a five-year termed contract, with two options to renew for a three-year period and then a two-year period, if all goes well.</p>
<p>The corporation’s estimates state that the real money site could generate as much as $375 million in revenues for the province during the first five years of operation, so this is no small move for Ontario.</p>
<p>Competition for Contract</p>
<p>The firm’s decision to choose SPIELO G2 wasn’t a quick one, as the decision-making process began more than 18 months ago, and saw other vendors competing for the contract, including Canada’s Amaya Gaming and the UK’s OpenBet, the company behind the British Columbia Lottery Corporation’s online gambling site PlayNow.com.</p>
<p>“The only safe, lawful and regulated Internet gaming option in Ontario” were the words used to describe the new site by Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation’s chief executive officer Rod Phillips, who is looking eagerly towards this big move.</p>
<p>Joining Other Provinces</p>
<p>When the site is up and running, Ontario will join the list of Canadian provinces offering a comprehensive online gambling option which currently includes Quebec, Manitoba, and British Columbia.</p>
<p>However, as Ontario’s population of 13 million is only a fraction behind the combined population of 13.5 million who reside in Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia combined, the province is set to become a huge source of income, and the popularity of online gambling in the area could explode once a regulated online gambling site is available to residents. If everything goes according to plan, we could see a shift in the area as players are able to use a site which is operated from within their province, rather than having to look for international operators.</p>
