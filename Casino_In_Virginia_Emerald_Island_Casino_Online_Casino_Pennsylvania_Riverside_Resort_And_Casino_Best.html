<p>Aristocrat Gaming has partnered with emoji for the launch of emoji All Stars, the pioneer emoji-brand slot machine</p>
<p>After the much-anticipated debuts of the NFL Kickoff slot machines and NFL Super Bowl Jackpots in the last months, the leading slot machine and casino game manufacturer, Aristocrat Gaming, has announced a further bolstering of its momentum with the launch of the official emoji All Stars slot machine.</p>
<p>The exciting release is expected to diversify the portfolio of the company that has received the Land-Based Industry Supplier of the Year award for the fifth consecutive year at the annual Global Gaming Awards held in October.</p>
<p>During the same ceremony, Aristocrat Gaming also received the industry’s Slot of the Year recognition for the sixth consecutive year for Jackpot Carnival while its Neptune Single Stratus Sign Package received the Best Land-Based Product award.</p>
<p>Selectable Characters, Free Games, Hold &amp; Spin, and Instant Feature</p>
<p>The new emoji All Stars multi-level progressive slot game featuring well-known emoji-branded icons and the studio’s all-star characters was originally presented to the public during the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The deal between the Germany-based business emoji company GmbH and Aristocrat Gaming was completed under the brokerage of Retail Monster LLC, which is the emoji company’s licensing agent for North America.</p>
<p>The new game embeds a series of interesting bonus features including Free Games, Hold &amp; Spin, and an Instant Feature, along with the option to select characters. emoji All Stars is currently available on the Neptune Single cabinet and it will reach all casino floors in 2024.</p>
<p>Two Years of Ongoing Development</p>
<p>As explained by emoji’s chief executive officer and founder, Marco Hüsges, the mix between the emoji brand and Aristocrat’s icons is expected to “entertain players around the world” while showcasing the results of over two years of hard work and ongoing development.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming’s president of Americas and Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Tom O’Brien, took the opportunity to comment on emojis and the way they have turned into an important component of “everyday communication and expression”.</p>
<p>O’Brien added that, through the new game, players will not only engage in fun gameplay with their preferred emoji icons, but they will also discover some of the most popular Aristocrat Gaming characters, including their iconic Buffalo.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, emoji announced a new agreement inked with restaurant chain, Del Arte, and the emoji brand aimed at the public in France. The deal that was brokered by WildBrain CPLG, a leading entertainment, sport, and brand licensing agency, will target children, and families and it will run until November 30, 2023, at Del Arte’s 200 restaurants across the country.</p>
