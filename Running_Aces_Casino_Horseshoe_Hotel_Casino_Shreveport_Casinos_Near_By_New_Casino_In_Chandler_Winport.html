    <h1>Running Aces Casino Horseshoe Hotel Casino Shreveport Casinos Near By New Casino In Chandler Winport</h1>

<p>I'm going to try and keep this short. After my first successful bonus play thru that left me able to cash out, I initiated withdrawal. I did not realize there was a clause saying that you can't deposit while you have an open withdrawal. I had attempted to deposit $30, but my card declined the transaction. Either way, my deposit was canceled. I do not deny any of this, I did make an error. Unfortunately for me, even tho my bank declined the transaction they still credited $30 to my account. I on multiple occasions spoke to support via the chat feature and told them that credit was not supposed to be there. I told them my bank declined it. I was told to play the credits on my account. I gave in and played with them eventually earning up a withdrawal amount of $170.35, which I think I initiated on may 30th. Naturally, they tried to take my deposit away, so I reached out to support and asked them why. They said thay I never paid the $30, and I replied that I knew that and had told them that, even sent emails in addition to chat conversations about this topic. The farthest I ever got was someone asked if my identity was verified. They checked, it was. Everything was in order. But eventually, days passed and I reached out again emailing and starting chats on the site, asking about my canceled deposit only to get the "you never paid the $30" to which I would again retell my story. I'm so tired of telling it. Here are some emails and such I had to maybe paint a clearer picture. Well, couldn't attach all the screenshots, but hope it helps.</p>
