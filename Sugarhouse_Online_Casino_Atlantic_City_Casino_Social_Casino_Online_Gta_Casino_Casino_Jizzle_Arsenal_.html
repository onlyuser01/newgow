<p>A brand-new round of the 2022-23 Premier League kicks off on Friday, April 21, with the clash between Arsenal and Southampton at Emirates Stadium in London</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Southampton is a duel between teams from opposite ends of the Premier League table. The Gunners are sitting at the top of the standings, while the Saints are currently stuck at the bottom. Knowing this, it’s no surprise that oddsmakers think Arsenal will triumph on Friday. Is there a way Southampton can stage an upset?</p>

<p>The Gunners Need to Take This Game Seriously</p>
<p>On paper, Mikel Arteta’s men look as if they’re going to have a very easy job on Friday, but they mustn’t get complacent. It’s because this is a must-win game for them if they want to stay at the top of the EPL table until the end of the season.</p>
<p>The thing is that the reigning champion Manchester City is just four points behind Arsenal. Plus, the Cityzens have played one game fewer than them. On top of everything, Arsenal and Man City meet next week. What all this means is that if the Gunners don’t win against Southampton, they could easily drop out of the No. 1 spot in near future.</p>
<p>Luckily for them, they do have the manpower to beat the Saints. However, you can be certain that the visitors from the South Coast will go all-in in this game. After all, they got nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Southampton to Try the Impossible on Friday</p>
<p>Only eight games are left for the Saints to play in the Premier League this season. They do have enough time to get out of the relegation zone as they’re currently just four points behind the closest team from the safe zone. The problem is that their recent form suggests they won’t collect too many points in the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>These guys are 0-2-4 in their last six games, but they did put on a good performance in a couple of those games. For instance, those two draws happened against Manchester United and Tottenham. Obviously, they do tend to show up against big opponents, but will the same be the case against Arsenal?</p>
<p>Odds suggest otherwise, mainly because the Saints have a horrible record against this team. They did beat Arsenal a couple of times in recent years, but they are without a single win against this team in EPL games played in London since the establishment of the league in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Southampton Prediction</p>
<p>Arsenal will win this game, we’re sure of that. However, we don’t think the Gunners are going to have an easy job on Friday. Instead, we should witness a real battle on the pitch, possibly with plenty of goals on both ends.</p>
<p>Pick: Arsenal to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
