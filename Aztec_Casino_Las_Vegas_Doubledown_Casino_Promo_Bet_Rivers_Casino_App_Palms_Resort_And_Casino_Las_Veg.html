    <h1>Aztec Casino Las Vegas Doubledown Casino Promo Bet Rivers Casino App Palms Resort And Casino Las Veg</h1>

<p>Stakelogic Live has launched a suite of network classic blackjack games, the company informed in a press release. Stakelogic is hoping that the latest addition will allow it to gain a firmer position in the live casino segment and deliver more excellent content to tier-one operators across the world. This release follows a number of important market entries for Stakelogic and its live products.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live’s New Blackjack Games Deliver Authenticity</p>
<p>The new suite comes along with four blackjack tables, two of which will be running 24/7. The minimum bets for all tables are set at €5 and €10 and the games offer a return to the player rate set at 99.51%. The American blackjack tables will be hosted out of the company’s studio in Birkirkara, Malta.</p>
<p>The studio uses cutting-edge equipment to deliver a superior player experience and is capable of streaming the best blackjack plays that have become the signature style of Stakelogic Live. The studio itself has been designed to immerse players in the authentic atmosphere of blackjack gaming, with interactive experiences at every step of the way.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live is determined to continue providing players from leading markets with the best possible live casino experience they can ever ask for. The company is focusing on fast-growing jurisdictions with a clear appetite for live casino titles, including the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and markets under Maltese licenses. Stakelogic Live head of live Richard Walker welcomed the opportunity to launch even more content and bring more excellent games to consumers. He noted:</p>
<p>We are now very much the live dealer provider of choice for operators looking to offer their players the most compelling, authentic online casino experience. Stakelogic Live head of live Richard Walker</p>
<p>Walker was confident that the addition of four classic blackjack games was evidence of the company’s commitment to the segment and Stakelogic Live’s incessant desire to be a leader in the sector. He also remained hopeful about the product’s global prospects.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Expands Rapidly with Live Casino Product</p>
<p>“We now look forward to seeing our network classic blackjack tables go live with our operator partners in markets around the world,” Walker concluded. Stakelogic launched in the United Kingdom earlier this year in August when the company was granted a license from the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>This marked a huge milestone for the company which managed to break ground into one of Europe’s most heavily regulated, but most lucrative markets. In July, the company launched Super Stake Roulette with BetCity in the Netherlands, another important market for the company and its aspirations as a live casino powerhouse.</p>
