    <h1>Casinos Chumba Casino Class Action Lawsuit New Casino In Lake Charles Doubledown Casino Slots Warm S</h1>

<p>this is a screen print of the day my money was supposed to be transfered to my bitcoin... it's been over a week and a half and one month later since I won my winnings.. The only thing they keep reciting to me is that the money is on its way... Yet never shows up... The casino states that using the Bitcoin wallet payout method I would receive my payout instantly... And yet here we are one month later... I jumped through their hoops and my payout is APPROVED... They just won't release the funds to me... I suggest no one go to this casino unless they don't expect money to be won... They say they are the most trusted casino... The only thing I am beginning to trust is that they are full of crap! Don't go... They are no more then con artist with money and a bunk ass website casino..... Judging from the numerous complaints over the same payout issue... It won't be long till this cosino flops due to law suits. Please help... I need this money for my business and this run around they have given me is heartbreaking and morally unethical. this is a screen print of the day my money was supposed to be transfered to my bitcoin... it's been over a week and a half and one month later since I won my winnings..
