    <h1>Saratoga Hotel And Casino Play Online Casino Casinos In Ruidoso New Mexico Chicago Casino Red Rock C</h1>

<p>Thank you very much for the forwarded email. I have checked the Responsible Gambling section on the casino's website and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>If you feel that your gambling has become problematic, you can self-exclude yourself by contacting Customer Service and requesting a self-exclusion period be applied to your account.</p>
<p>The following Self-Exclusion periods are available:</p>
<p>• 1 week</p>
<p>• 2 weeks</p>
<p>• 1 month</p>
<p>• 3 months</p>
<p>• 6 months</p>
<p>We will endeavor to apply your self-exclusion as soon as practically possible, however, please note that this process takes a reasonable working period to implement. We will not consider the self-exclusion period as having commenced until it has been fully implemented and communicated to you. If you can still access any of our services after self-exclusions, it is your responsibility to contact us immediately to inform us.</p>
<p>Any unsettled bets with Rajabets at the time that you enter into self-exclusion will be settled on the result of the event. If your bet is a winner, your winnings will be automatically withdrawn to your applicable credit/debit card or another financial account from which the funds were deposited.</p>
<p>Please note that upon your selected self-exclusion period expiring, your account will be automatically reactivated.</p>
<p>It is possible to revoke Self-exclusion upon a written request (and thereafter only after 24 hours has elapsed from the submitted written request), and Rajabets will always do all it can do to detect and close any new duplicate accounts that you may open. Once the self-exclusion is applied, you will also no longer receive any further marketing materials from us."</p>
<p>Please send another email and specify the reason why you wish your account to be blocked (reason for self-exclusion should be problematic gambling) and indicate the time period (ideally without a possibility for reopening).</p>
<p>Please keep me informed.</p>
