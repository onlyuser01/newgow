    <h1>Fortune Casino Login Casino Nyc Rio All Suites And Casino Las Vegas Wild Horse Pass Hotel And Casino</h1>

<p>Over the last year, the company's CasinoEngine platform has seen rapid growth and in May hit important milestones, acknowledging its scalability and popularity</p>
<p>The fast-growing business-to-business (B2B) technology provider for the online gambling industry, EveryMatrix, celebrated an important milestone for its CasinoEngine platform. A statement released by the company Wednesday reveals that its CasinoEngine platform surpassed 4 billion monthly casino game rounds, as well as €4 billion ($4.34 billion) in monthly turnover for May.</p>
<p>Stian Enger Pettersen, EveryMatrix’s head of casino, acknowledged that the milestones reaffirm the company’s ongoing growth and presence within the competitive gambling market. At the same time, he explained that the rapid growth is a testament to the confidence the company’s partners have in its products.</p>
<p>Pettersen thanked EveryMatrix’s B2B partners for their continuous support and trust. Finally, he explained that the company remains committed to delivering innovative, creative and effective solutions that can bring success to the growing iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>“These milestones showcase our strength and leading presence in the market, the trust our partners have in us and our products, and just how rapidly both our clients are growing, and we are growing as a result.“ Stian Enger Pettersen, head of casino, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>The Company Enjoys Significant Growth</p>
<p>The latest achievement dating to May is a testament to CasinoEngine’s rapid growth over the last year. Between 2018 and July 2022, the platform saw significant growth from 1 billion casino game rounds to 2 billion rounds. However, since then, which was less than a year ago, or 11 months, the casino game rounds for its platform soared to 4 billion.</p>
<p>Judging by the recent update released by EveryMatrix, its monthly gross gaming revenue (GGR) saw an increase of 50% in the last eight months. The B2B technology provider confirmed that this growth was the result of CasinoEngine’s “exceptional performance driving continuous growth among tier-1 clients.”</p>
<p>A comparison of GGR shows that in June 2020, it was €55 million ($59.6 million). Then, in November last year, it soared to €100 million ($108.5 million), while finally, last month, it surpassed €150 million ($162.7 million). This rapid growth reaffirms the scalability of the company’s platform and its innovative approach.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s latest report reveals that the platform’s monthly casino turnover skyrocketed as well. Back in May 2021, the platform’s turnover hit €2 billion ($2.2 billion), marking a record at the time. Then, in less than a year, in February 2023, it increased to €3 billion ($3.3 billion). That process of rapid growth continued and after three months, in May, CasinoEngine’s turnover hit the €4 billion ($4.34 billion) milestone.</p>
