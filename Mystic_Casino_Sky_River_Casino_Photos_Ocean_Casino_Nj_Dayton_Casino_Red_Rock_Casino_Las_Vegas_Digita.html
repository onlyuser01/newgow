<p>After entering into a multi-state alliance with DraftKings and expanding its presence in the US industry, Digital Gaming Corporation’s B2B iGaming Division (DGC) has introduced its suite of online games with the market-leading sportsbook and casino operator.</p>
<p>DraftKings and DGC Agreement</p>
<p>Following the effective integration with DGC’s remote game server, DraftKings players in New Jersey now have access to exclusive and varied online casino games from DGC’s impressive portfolio, including titles such as 9 Masks of Fire, Assassin Moon, and Diamond Inferno, with additional state releases to come.</p>
<p>DGC made its US debut in New Jersey only a few months ago, partnering with BetMGM, an Entain (formerly GVC) and MGM joint venture, with its content now live and performing extremely well across all of the operator’s online gambling brands.</p>
<p>DGC’s B2B iGaming Division is headed by a group of industry experts with extensive market-entry expertise, and the entire division is dedicated to giving operators and their players the best possible experience.</p>
<p>Each game is designed to appeal to a wide range of players, with engaging entertainment generated by teams who are familiar with American tastes.</p>
<p>DGC’s seasoned team has demonstrated its ability to produce cutting-edge, creative, and world-class online games for use in the controlled US market through its US studios.</p>
<p>DraftKings Lucrative Partnerships</p>
<p>Chief commercial officer of DGC’s B2B iGaming Division, Neill Whyte, said: “DraftKings has established itself as one of the top online gambling brands in the regulated US market so we are thrilled to see our games integrated into its content offering.”</p>
<p>Whyte continued by stating that this is another significant deal for DGC, and it is part of the company’s larger, more aggressive plans to expand the scope of its online casino content in New Jersey and other states in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Just a week ago DraftKings and Socure signed a multi-year deal. Socure, the pioneer in digital identity confidence, now provides DraftKings with its Socure ID+ identity authentication suite as part of the agreement. DraftKings is now able to easily communicate with its customers through its product suite as a result of this change, which will improve its compliance steps.</p>
<p>Online identity authentication is simplified with Socure’s identity verification suite. As a result, drop-off rates and frictions are reduced, resulting in a higher new player conversion rate.</p>
<p>Digital Gaming Corporation’s B2B iGaming Solutions Division is pursuing its expansion into the controlled US market, and the company believes that the multi-state agreement with DraftKings would be critical in establishing itself as North America’s leading content provider.</p>
<p>DraftKings is a high-quality operator, and DGC believes that their games will be extremely common among their players in states all over the United States.</p>
