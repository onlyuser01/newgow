    <h1>Chumba Casino Sweepstakes Casinos In Lake Charles La Borgata Hotel And Casino Casino Del Sol Hotel H</h1>

<p>The issue is that I've been a customer at the casino for 5 years and recently they asked me for additional verification. I've sent them everything, multiple times, but they are dragging it out and asking for things I don't have - a utility bill.</p>
<p>I'm sending them the certificate from the municipality, and yet they still request a utility bill.</p>
<p>Additionally, every time they want something, they wait 48 hours to change my status on the site and they don't even send me an email.</p>
<p>When I joined the chat, they closed it three times without giving me an answer or connecting me with a manager.</p>
<p>This has been going on for 2 weeks now, and it's not about the small amount of money, but the principle, that you rate this casino as number 1 and that it's secure!!</p>
<p>I don't agree with this and if you really care, help me to get verified, I have all the necessary documents in excellent quality and I've already sent them to them 2-3 times.</p>
<p>They are just stubborn and I don't know why?</p>
<p>I cannot accept that they are number one on your site!!</p>
<p>I regularly recommend you to friends who ask me where to play.</p>
<p>Now I'm stopping because I don't want them to suffer just because they saw Palmsbet in first place and decided to register and then get upset at me afterwards!</p>
<p>With your assistance, I am ready to contact them. They are not responding to me and are not letting me communicate with someone in a responsible position.</p>
<p>Please help, or simply write that they are not up to standard and not a secure site!!</p>
