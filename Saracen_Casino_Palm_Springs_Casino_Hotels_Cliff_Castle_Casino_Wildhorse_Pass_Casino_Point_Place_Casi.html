<p>Reels of Fortune Slot Review</p>
<p>Reels of Fortune online slot is a Woohoo Games game that is inspired by classic slot mechanics but has put a nice polish on the traditional fruit experience. With a highly polished one-line and three-reel grid, the game packs a surprising amount of fun in one neat package. Players will enjoy multipliers, a Bonus Wheel Feature, and hourly, daily, and Super Hot Drop Jackpot that will be available to you once you get started.</p>
<p>The game sports a nice user interface and a modern look, even if the main game mechanics are a throwback to simpler times. With a 500x multiplier to scoop up a juicy prize and flexible betting limits, you will definitely be in for a treat with this one! Play it for free or for real money, but before you do – make sure to read our full Reels of Fortune slot review.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Simple Yet Captivating</p>
<p>Reels of Fortune has built a solid game that is based on a three-reel and one-line gameplay. The slot is designed as a luxurious one-arm bandit machine with cogwheels discreetly spinning in the background. The payable is neatly displayed on the left-hand side making it easier for players to know what to expect.</p>
<p>Reels of Fortunes is about a quaint and transparent experience. The jackpots, denominated as Mini, Minor, Major, Mega, and Vegas, will be displayed in real-time with their actual sums at the time of playing. The grid is filled with highly-stylized symbols of traditional classic slots, such as cherries, sevens, bars, and diamonds that serve as a wild.</p>
<p>This is correct, although a classic game, Reels of Fortune has not shied away from integrating a wild symbol to help boost your potential to win from the game. The reels spin with a pleasant soft thud and there is parlor music playing in the background adding to the immersiveness of the game.</p>
<p>Reels of Fortune Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Reels of Fortune features a simple payable and will pay for combinations of two or three symbols. The symbols you can expect to find here include multi-tier bars, a single-tier bar, cherries, sevens, and of course, the wild diamond-shaped symbol. You will notably get the biggest value out of getting three wilds on the payline for a $500 payout.</p>
<p>There is also a special Bonus Symbol that is shaped like a golden coin with the words Bonus across it. This symbol only appears in the third reel, and it will unlock the Bonus Wheel. The Bonus Wheel will offer multipliers between 5x and 500x, but you may also trigger a second Bonus Wheel game which features jackpots, ranging from Mini to Vegas.</p>
<p>All payouts are awarded from left to right with the central row being the one where the winning combination is formed. Simple and easy to follow, Reels of Fortune’s gameplay and symbols will guarantee that you are having a fun time with one of Wohoo Games’ best slot machines.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>In terms of visuals and audio, Reels of Fortune is attentive. There is no unnecessary show of opulence, just soft touches of elegance here and there that accentuate the classic look and feel of the game and create a captivating look for the simple grid. The audio is nicely selected to play at a low hum and the reels make a nice thud sound when they land and settle on the payline.</p>
<p>Reels of Fortune Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay here is designed for accessibility. The paytable is already displayed when you load the game, adding to the ability to quickly find what combinations are worthwhile and what to avoid. Although it all comes down to chance, it’s still a nice addition.</p>
<p>The play buttons are visible and easy to navigate. You can click on spin to send the reels for a round. Players can also choose the Autoplay feature that has an unlimited number of rounds, but we recommend picking one of the pre-configured values instead. You can select the value of the bet adjusting it to be anything from 0.20 to 100 per bet.</p>
<p>Other than that, there is more information that you can find about the game in the upper left corner of the screen where the game features, payouts, and symbols are explained in further detail.</p>
<p>Reels of Fortune Features: Wild Multiplier, Bonus, Jackpot Wheel</p>
<p>For a classic game, Reels of Fortune is not short of excellent game features that will only add to the level of fun you get out of the slot. Players will have three main features to pick from.</p>
<p>Wild Multiplier: Multipliers in Reels of Fortune are a frequent sight, and they will help to nudge your winnings along, offering some decent payouts when you need them. The multipliers will range from 2x and 5x, adding a neat underlying mechanic.</p>
<p>Bonus: The bonus game is about an even bigger multiplier as you can get one of two possible outcomes. One is to possibly multiply your bet size by 500x for a truly outstanding payday or you can access the third bonus feather – The Jackpot Wheel, which will pay a number of possible jackpots.</p>
<p>Jackpot Wheel: The Jackpot Wheel is probably why we are all here, as there are not one or two, but five different progressive jackpots that you can benefit from. The game offers hourly, daily, and massive jackpots that you can claim by simply sticking around and playing.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Spin of the Reels to Make a Fortune</p>
<p>All in all, Reels of Fortune is an outstanding game that you will enjoy a lot even if you are not particularly keen on classic slot machines. For those of you who are, the nice designer touches that create a bespoke classic slot experience will definitely appeal to you! Reels of Fortune lives up to its name, courtesy of its clever multipliers, wild features, and five fantastic jackpots that may be won at any time!</p>
