    <h1>Hustler Casino Live Casino Ignite 777 Harrah S Resort Casino Doubledown Casino Free Code Hollywood C</h1>

<p>I would like to ask you, what law did allow the argocasino (risk department) to cancel my bets? In my opinion, this was done without a reason.</p>
<p>On the 23rd March 2020 they have canceled my bets, even those that were settled correctly as won in February.</p>
<p>I played in Argocasino generally since December 2019. When I was losing money at the beginning, it was all fine. When I started to win money, they suddenly closed my account under nothing-saying-to-me reason "risk department close your account".</p>
<p>,,Dear xxx, This e-mail is to inform you that account xxx was closed and last deposit have been returned to the original payment method. The account has been closed on the basis of information received from the Risk Department of software provider of our Sportsbook and in accordance with paragraph 3.8 of the ArgoSport Rules. Best wishes ArgoCasino Team,,</p>
<p>I did nothing wrong. Why they took my money?</p>
<p>I found no rules in Argocasino terms &amp; conditions to cancel the bets without any reason.</p>
<p>They think it's normal to cancel bets and not pay money. From my point of view it's just a stealing.</p>
<p>I understand that they can close the account, but why will they cancel all the correct bets? Eg. I placed a bet in 8th March 2020 that Juventus will win with Inter and some match in the NBA (I don't remember and I can't enter the account to see) and I managed to win over 2.5 thousund euro. What is was wrong with it that they also canceled this sportsbook after almost two weeks? Which point of their terms &amp; condition allow them to do this?</p>
<p>BTW I would like to list their lies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>According to Argocasino, my last payment was 27th Feb. It's not true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They suggest that they first closed the account and then paid the last deposit, crap!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They have paid PLN 2,000 in the morning, and only after a few hours they have closed the account in the evening.</p>
<p>I can show it in screenshots</p>
<p>For over half a year now, I have been trying to recover money from them.</p>
<p>Many people have tried to help me over this time and each of them agree with me. They can only write back to each of these people;player,, exploiting situational errors," which is bullshit. I won mainly on popular NBA and champions league.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>They owe me over 110,000 PLN (~ 25,000 EUR) that I had on my account.</p>
<p>Greetings</p>
