    <h1>Palms Casino Casinos In Dallas Tx Riverside Resort Hotel Casino Tampa Hard Rock Casino Fitz Casino C</h1>

<p>Deposited $400 and was shown on my banking statement and billed by their deposit provider $401.30 including service fee transaction for my bank as it's foreign fee and doesn't always charge me AUD.</p>
<p>My new manager Flavio shut me off by giving me a dead end answer and refuse to resolve this and come to a solution or Escalate it higher. So Flavio said finance team mentioned they didn't get the money and that the provider showing on statement isn't theirs. When past Deposit done on their site shows the same provider, so basically they saying I deposited in past and wasn't billed? If that isn't their provider on my bank statement. Magically someone else billed me? And I been depositing on their casino Midas and jack million site with out any charges!</p>
<p>Flavio has requested me to get trace on the transaction and that will cause my new bank to know I'm going online gambling activity and transaction which is not allowed and breaches the term and conditions when I signed up to this new bank I'm with. As my other bank got suspended for online gambling activity and transaction on caisno Midas and jackmillion recently! Which I have 10k frozen on my old bank thats suspended from this dilemma.</p>
<p>Shame they treat a high roller long term player like this that has invested Deposit over 400k on their site since joining!</p>
<p>Yet they can resolve this $400 issue deposit, I'm disappointed as caisno Midas and jack million casino site has done down hill in service and communication.</p>
<p>I had no choice to stop playing on their site today and post to complaint and review/ dispute!</p>
<p>Yet when I advise them this before hand the always say I'm threatening them, when I'm not and nor is that my intentions. I only had to do this to warn other new players and high roller VIP Players about this issue. This is also to cover my back as I resorted into this, which I refrained from and gave them reasonable time to sort this out!</p>
<p>Shame on caisno Midas and jack million online casino site!</p>
<p>I do acknowledge Flavio is new and he has tried his hardest but still disappointed left in his hands and neglected by Frank. As my old manager Alex was the best I had on their site, but unfortunately he left the caisno.</p>
<p>Was a good site back then but suggest not to join them or play with them after this issue!</p>
