    <h1>Mychoice Casino Home Augustine Casino Talking Stick Resort And Casino Morongo Casino Jobs Biloxi Mis</h1>

<p>I started by activating the welcome bonus in which I had to reach the sum of 500,000 to be able to complete it and thus be able to withdraw what you won, if you do not fulfill it YOU CANNOT WITHDRAW IT, the page does not let you and tells you that you must complete it And how much do you need to achieve it? When I completed it, I had 190,000 in my account and when I tried to withdraw it, I had no problem since it had been achieved. I activated another free spins bonus (that they gave me for the inconvenience that I comment below. ) I had problems with 3 games where they did not give me the indicated win within it,</p>
<p>one amount was 33,000, another 8,000 and another 9,000.</p>
<p>I must point out that the help service is extremely incompetent, I had to report 3 times where I had to send a screenshot (as if I saw the future and assumed that the game might not give me the prize within it, if one knew that this happens, who would play to lose money?) That yes, the last game that gave me an error if I could have a window capture because with the first time I was attentive to it happening... they did not answer me, they told me that they would be in 2 hours or 4 hours, then the next day, then in 2 days and so on...until they obviously said that there was no record that I played at the indicated time. People are extremely disrespectful and have no language skills at all. They don't handle information well either, since one told me that they would review the video of the game and after that, another agent told me that there was no such thing.</p>
<p>Returning to the issue of the casino a few days after requesting the withdrawal, several days had already passed and they told me that it was in process. I go into the account and it comes out that I have 69,420. I thought....did they give me the prize for the game error? and the 190,000 must be in process and that's why they don't appear) and no... They discounted the money for the free spins bonus (which gave me almost no profit and I had to complete another 500,000 but only in that game) and I ask...why did they take my money when I had already made the withdrawal, that is why they let me carry out the action, as I already explained, the page DOES NOT LET YOU MAKE WITHDRAWALS if you have an active bonus. But of course, they say it's because of the free spins bonus and end. Your word against mine....Very easy to wait for the days and withhold the withdrawal until another bonus ends its term and discount it.</p>
<p>I had never had such a bad experience with bets and services. I have screenshots of the chat and log things.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that they do not continue in this bookmaker because it is a ROBBERY</p>
<p>Here clearly (in the images that I upload) it tells me that to make ANOTHER WITHDRAWAL I had to reach the sum of the other bonus that they gave me for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>For the withdrawal that I made BEFORE there was no problem and even so they discounted it.</p>
