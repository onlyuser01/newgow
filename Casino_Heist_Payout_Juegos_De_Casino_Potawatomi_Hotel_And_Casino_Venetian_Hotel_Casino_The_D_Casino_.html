<p>KSA, the Dutch gambling regulator, has released its 2020 annual report as the Netherlands prepare to launch their Remote Gambling Act in 2021.</p>
<p>Dutch Online Gaming Market Readies Up for October Launch</p>
<p>Ahead of the launch of the Dutch KOA Act in 2021, the Kansspelautoriteit (KSA) has issued its annual report for 2020, which outlines the new guidelines and rules that will fundamentally reform the Netherlands iGaming industry.</p>
<p>KSA also announced that it has garnered a total of 40 applications from international and domestic candidates for remote gambling licenses. The KOA Act’s licensing period will start on April 1, with KSA expecting to award 35 online gambling licenses in 2021. The regulator will begin examining license applications at the beginning of April, ahead of the official launch of the Dutch remote betting market on October 1.</p>
<p>KSA will initiate a technical evaluation of licensed companies prior to the launch to guarantee that their platforms are linked to the CRUKS self-exclusion registry. Registered operators must also ensure that their systems are connected to the KSA central database, which tracks all money transfers, and customer registrations and log-ins.</p>
<p>KSA has reiterated its previous notice that it will undertake a firm due diligence process on applicants. The regulator will evaluate gaming providers’ principles in terms of corporate ethics, regulation, and social responsibility obligations.</p>
<p>Focus on Safer Gambling and Customer Protection</p>
<p>KSA’s key objectives for the act’s launch and success have been reasserted as safer wagering practices and consumer safety. Chairman René Jansen stated that the regulator’s main focus is “ultimately” on the players’ needs and protection. “A fair market remains an important objective but is above all a means to allow consumers to play safely,” he added.</p>
<p>In addition to the technical criteria, KSA insisted that all KOA candidates register a “Dutch officer,” who will act as the company’s legal representative in the Netherlands. The three entities that will run KSA’s gambling harm prevention and addiction care services across the country, in collaboration with Dutch national health departments, were confirmed in March.</p>
<p>KSA has simplified the KOA act’s motto from “Play safe in a fair market” to “Play safe” in preparation for a watershed year for the Netherlands gambling industry.</p>
