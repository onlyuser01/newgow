<p>The leading digital sports media company, Playmaker, announced a major acquisition Tuesday. The company revealed it acquired Wedge Traffic Limited in a deal with a $31.2 million price tag. As a result of the recent acquisition, Wedge Traffic becomes the company's first affiliate platform business as Playmaker looks to expand further into the iGaming and affiliate industries within the growing US market.</p>
<p>Additionally, Wedge Traffic complements Playmaker in key areas of expertise and fits well within the company's ecosystem. With Wedge Traffic on Playmaker's side, the company will be able to meet the continuously increasing demand for casino and sports betting content.</p>
<p>In a statement released on October 18, 2022, Wedge Traffic's CEO, Dan Kersh, said: "Outside of the fact that Playmaker's diverse portfolio of brands will directly complement our business, there were two key reasons for making the decision to join the Playmaker family."</p>
<p>He explained: "Firstly, they understand how to support and accelerate data driven marketing within the iGaming sector. Secondly, and perhaps of even greater importance, they appreciate the value of creating a winning culture and how it must be considered the heartbeat of any successful business."</p>
<p>Currently, Wedge already has a strong presence in North America. The company is active in Ontario, Canada, as well as 16 US states. Its diversification efforts are key for success, considering that the company doesn't rely on a single jurisdiction but rather focuses on expanding its presence. The affiliate has existing partnerships with 15 online casinos and sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new acquisition, Wedge Traffic's founders David Copeland and Dan Kersh will become a part of Playmaker's team. The duo will join the senior leadership team and leverage their iGaming affiliation expertise to help the company grow further into the vertical.</p>
<p>Jordan Gnat, Playmaker's CEO, added: "We have been very clear that creating a center of excellence in affiliate was key to rounding out our offering as a leading sports media business." He outlined that the company remains committed to meeting the needs of its sports betting and iGaming partners and acknowledged that the acquisition of Wedge will supercharge this process.</p>
<p>Gnat said that Wedge has a team of seasoned professionals with years of experience with which Playmaker will be glad to collaborate. In conclusion, Playmaker's CEO predicted that the experience of Wedge will help the company and complement its growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that Playmaker focuses on the growing iGaming and sports betting market in the US. Since PASPA's repeal back in 2018, by now, there are 21 states and the District of Columbia that offer mobile sports betting. With that in mind, additional states have already legalized the activity and are preparing its launch.</p>
