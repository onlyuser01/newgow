<p>Betfred has replaced its old insights hub with a brand new one aligned with its upgraded content strategy meant to offer better-tailored resources</p>
<p>The leading betting and gaming company with over five decades of experience in the industry, more than 1300 shops, and over 9500 employees, Betfred, has announced the launch of its fresh insights hub, Insights.betfred.com.</p>
<p>The new hub, which replaces the former blog.betfred.com hub that has been part of the company’s digital portfolio for the past 15 years, complements the upgraded content strategy embraced by the giant that is constantly pushing its limits for innovation and “always on the lookout for the best talent.”</p>
<p>The New Hub to Provide Original Content, Quick Answers, and Helpful Information</p>
<p>The new hub will allow Betfred’s customers to find original content, have their questions answered professionally, and get informed regarding the company’s services, products, sponsorship deals, and promotions. This way, customers can expect to have their experiences significantly improved and their interactions with the brand positively impacted thanks to the new project.</p>
<p>The content management system of the new website, along with the upgraded content processes, are geo-friendly, supporting the company’s growth in the US, where Betfred entered as Betfred Sportsbook in 2019, and South Africa, where the group acquired Betting World in June 2021, thus marking its entrance here.</p>
<p>In June 2022, Betfred signed an agreement with LottoStar, further expanding its presence in South Africa.</p>
<p>The new hub is a collaboration between the content, brand, and marketing departments, with the common objective of delivering top-tier content with enhanced market visibility. The content will consist of a plethora of detailed analyses, previews of iconic events in the world of sports, exclusive interviews, advanced tutorials, and educational guides for safer gambling experiences.</p>
<p>Together, the new content additions will complement Betfred’s gaming, sports, and lottery products.</p>
<p>The new Insights hub will also serve as a liaison for the company’s retail and online offerings, delivering exclusive content dedicated to Betfred TV that will be presented on the site.</p>
<p>Popular Brand Ambassadors to Deliver the Fresh Content</p>
<p>The new content will be professionally delivered via weekly interviews with famous brand ambassadors for Betfred. The list will include names like former England right-back and Premier League title winner Glen Johnson, two-time Premier League winner and Champions League-winning striker Louis Saha, and chief Golf Tipster who will continue to cover the Professional Golfers’ Association of America, the Ladies Professional Golf Association, and Dubai Port World Tours, Jamie Worsley.</p>
<p>Betfred’s head of copy and content, Russell Palmer, took the opportunity to express their pride for the brand having “a new digital output” that enables it to put its business successes on full display.</p>
<p>The company was issued a fine of £3.25 million ($4.25 million) by the UK Gambling Commission over a number of anti-money laundering and social responsibility failures in July.</p>
<p>A month prior, the company announced inking a “What a Shout” sponsorship deal with Spotlight Sports.</p>
