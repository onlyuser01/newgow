<p>Buffalo King Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around the American wilderness.</p>
<p>Players will stumble onto rugged terrain and discover a host of majestic animals from mountain lions to bald eagles, and of course the iconic buffalo. As the sun goes down on the wild landscape, players will see if they can keep the mythical animals on their side.</p>
<p>This game offers a refreshing taste of the outdoors and players will love meeting the beautiful creatures of this untamed world.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack brings to mind the Old West, but with an enchanted twist. Twangy notes are combined with shimmering sounds for an effect that make players feel like they’ve wandered into the desert and encountered spirits.</p>
<p>The animation of the wildlife symbols is breathtakingly realistic. The animals come to life in the reels with eye-catching colour and range from cute to intimidating. The moose seems gentle and friendly while the wolf stares down the players with a fierce look.</p>
<p>The backdrop behind the reels is a sunset landscape that seems to portray America’s Monument Valley. The vast plateau is punctuated with buttes of stone and seems dry and unforgiving.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of this game bring to life the American wilderness and create an immersive atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>This slot uses the Megaways system, which randomises the number of symbols on the reels for each spin.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for matching symbols in adjacent symbols from left to right.</p>
<p>This game’s cascade feature means that when symbols are part of winning combinations, they vanish after paying out. This leaves their positions open for fresh symbols to fall into their place.</p>
<p>Players will have the option to choose a bet multiplier and this choice will change the way the game behaves. With a bet multiplier of x20, the play will be normal, but with a bet multiplier of x25, players will have a naturally doubled chance to win free spins as well as a greater number of Bonus symbols on the reels.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Players receive 12 free spins when they land 4 Bonus symbols. If players land 5 Bonus symbols, they will receive 17 free spins, and if they land 6 Bonus symbols, 22 free spins are awarded.</p>
<p>In the Free Spins feature, Wild symbols will land with a random multiplier of x2, x3, or x5. When a Wild forms part of a winning combination, players accumulate its multiplier and the accumulated multipliers at the end of a cascade sequence will apply to all its wins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.52%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility Wilderness-themed game.</p>
<p>With its impressive volatility alone, this slot would have plenty of appeal, but its gorgeous animation and invigorating theme make it unmissable.</p>
<p>The familiar style of bonus opportunities keeps the game engaging.</p>
