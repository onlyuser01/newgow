    <h1>Winport Casino Mega Star Casino Winstar Casino In Thackerville Ok Kickapoo Casino Harrah Durango Cas</h1>

<p>GameArt has strengthened its presence in the Swiss iGaming market by bringing another bunch of its games to a new local operator. Pasino.ch, the online casino arm of Casino Du Lac Meyrin SA in Geneva, will now offer its players a range of HTML5 and optimized games that are some of GameArt’s top-performing titles as well.</p>
<p>Switzerland has enjoyed a sustained interest in its iGaming industry. Although all operators in the country are owned by Swiss-based land-based casinos, there has been a steady influx of supplier brands to cater to local player preference with GameArt no exception here.</p>
<p>GameArt is going to offer Pasino.ch players a range of spot-on titles, including Dynamite Fruits Deluxe, SummerJam, Lucky Coins, Hollywoof, Xtreme Hot, Super-Heated 7’s, Muspelheim’s Treasure, Book of Cupigs, and so many more.</p>
<p>Pasino.ch Managing Director Rupert Ecker welcomed this new opportunity and said that he was excited to see one of the best collections of games further strengthen the brand’s library and provide players with high-quality titles.</p>
<p>GameArt Head of Sales Nevena Aleksieva was similarly pleased with the opportunity that this meant for GameArt’s own footprint in the fast-evolving Swiss gaming market. She hailed the new casino part and its parent company, Groupe Partouche, and said that the supplier was keen to deliver exceptional products in the market.</p>
<p>Doing so through Pasino.ch was a great opportunity. "By diversifying Pasino.ch's slot mix and adding new interesting and appealing slot games, we aim to strengthen GameArt's positioning in Switzerland," Aleksieva assured.</p>
<p>Pasino.ch has also been actively looking to strengthen its library of games bringing worthwhile experiences to its players. As a result, the casino has been scaling up its content library with trusted brands such as Pragmatic Play and Bragg Gaming Group.</p>
<p>Other casinos in the country have also been keen to strengthen their portfolios by introducing more suppliers to stay competitive. Mycasino, owned by Grand Casino Luzern, added both Pragmatic Play and Light &amp; Wonder as well over the past several months to ensure that it is an established and competitive iGaming brand.</p>
<p>GameArt is bound to move further into the market as well, adding to the number of partner casinos as well as the overall number of available games.</p>
