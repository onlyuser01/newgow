<p>Red Rake Gaming, a leading provider of engaging content for the online gambling vertical, announced it will continue its Dutch-facing expansion via a partnership with Casino777. Announced Tuesday, the new collaboration sees the premium casino content supplier agree to deliver its innovative and high-end casino games for Casino777.nl in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Per the new collaboration, Casino777.nl introduced leading localized games from Red Rake Gaming. Such included the developer's popular action-packed slot Super25Stars, as well as other games that are proven hits in different markets around the globe. The operator would also benefit from titles that are proven to be popular with Dutch players.</p>
<p>Elevating the experience and fan engagement further, the online casino will bring games such as Red Rake Gaming's Million 777 Wheel, which grants players unique chances to secure big prizes. Additional titles from the developer include Buffalo on Fire!, Ultra Burst, as well as Guardians of Luxor, among others.</p>
<p>Nick Barr, Red Rake Gaming Malta's Managing Director, shared his excitement about the recent collaboration with Casino777 in a statement. "We are delighted to be a part of Casino777's expansion into the Dutch market, further solidifying our existing fruitful collaboration," he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Barr pointed out: "The Red Rake Gaming content offering caters very well to arcade/casino cultured markets, and as such we have built up a great player following already in the Dutch market since our launch in October 2021." Finally, the company's Managing Director said that Red Rake Gaming is looking forward to offering top-performing games for Casino777's customers in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new partnership, Red Rake Games continues its European and Dutch expansion. The company has already established a strong presence in the market by teaming up with leading operators and the deal with Casino777 expands further its portfolio of partners. At the same time, Red Rake Games' titles enjoy growing popularity among players in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Casino777 comes on the heels of another important deal announced by the fast-growing iGaming developer. Earlier this month, Red Rake Gaming confirmed it joined forces with Malta-based Claymore Group.</p>
<p>Under the terms of that deal, the content provider agreed to power iBet, Claymore Group's online gambling brand, with its top-performing titles. Thanks to the content deal, iBet's customers can now experience leading games from Red Rake Gaming. While this will help boost the brand's presence, it also helps the gaming developer reach new audiences.</p>
