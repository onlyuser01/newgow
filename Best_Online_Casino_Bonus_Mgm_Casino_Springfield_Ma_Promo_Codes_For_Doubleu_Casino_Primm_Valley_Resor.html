<p>During the 2021-2022 financial year, the National Lottery in the UK distributed nearly £2 billion ($2.4 billion) to good causes, judging by data released earlier this week.</p>
<p>National Lottery Allocates $2BN to Good Causes for 2021-22</p>
<p>The total sum, distributed to good causes by the Lottery for the 12 months until March 31, 2022, was £1.84 billion ($2.21 billion). When compared to the funds distributed to good causes for 2020-2021, an increase of less than 1% was observed. According to a breakdown released by the National Lottery, the highest sum to good causes was distributed during the third quarter. In Q3, £508.5 million ($608.9 million) was allocated to good causes, while in Q2, that number was £418.4 million ($501 million). During the first quarter of the 2021-2022 financial year, £420.7 million ($503.7 million) was allocated toward good causes, while in the fourth quarter that sum was £491.3 million ($588.3 million).</p>
<p>Since its launch back in 1994, to date, the National Lottery has generated £43.7 billion ($52.3 billion) which was allocated to good causes. With billions of funds each year, by now, more than 670,000 projects, both small and large have received funds.</p>
<p>The Legal Battle over the National Lottery License Continues</p>
<p>The recent announcement comes at a time when the legal hurdle regarding Allwyn’s license for the National Lottery continues. Back in March, the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) announced it favors Allwyn for the National Lottery license starting from 2024. This would mean that Camelot, who spearheaded the Lottery for three decades, would no longer be in charge.</p>
<p>But the UKGC faced fierce opposition as International Game Technology, Camelot and Northern and Shell challenged its decision to award Allwyn the contract in court. After that, the High Court in Great Britain voted to revoke the suspension of Allwyn’s license for the National Lottery. While that sounded like the end of the legal battle, both IGT and Camelot were allowed to appeal.</p>
<p>As a result of the appeal, for the moment it looks like Allwyn’s license suspension remains in place. However, according to the Gambling Commission, the appeal may be resolved in the beginning of September. While ultimately Allwyn is after winning the license, this may result in dire consequences for Camelot. In fact, back in May, Camelot warned it may even go bankrupt if it loses its National Lottery license to Allwyn.</p>
