<p>The agreement will allow International Game Technology (IGT) to bring advanced solutions to third-party partners that are looking to benefit from remote game server (RGS) technologies delivered by both IGT and Greentube.</p>
<p>Greentube and IGT Forge Groundbreaking RGS Partnership</p>
<p>Greentube is known for its advanced work on this technology, as it enables the company to deliver its products to a global audience and guarantees that games will run smoothly and without a hitch.</p>
<p>The opportunity was welcomed by IGT CEO of global gaming Renato Ascoli who said that through this deal, IGT will continue to pursue innovative solutions throughout the industry and find such with the help of established companies. Ascoli added:</p>
<p>We look forward to providing the entire gaming industry with the opportunity to license the combined RGS portfolios of IGT and Greentube which cover compelling technologies for delivering games to customers wherever they play. IGT CEO of global gaming Renato Ascoli</p>
<p>IGT and Greentube though will work on protecting their intellectual property â€“ both as a unit through the new collaboration and individually. However, the exchange of expertise and technology will continue to offer consumers and gaming businesses better overall solutions.</p>
<p>Greentube CEO Thomas Graf welcomed this new opportunity and said that this was an important example of how intellectual property agreements can be struck for the betterment of the entire industry and private business operations.</p>
<p>Building the Future of the Industry Through Collaborations of Trust</p>
<p>Greentube will continue to expand its premium gaming products and solutions thanks to this arrangement, Graf assured. He added:</p>
<p>The combined RGS portfolios of Greentube and IGT are truly state-of-the-art, representing a combined prowess and gaming industry leadership that is well-positioned to fuel continued success. Greentube CEO Thomas Graf</p>
<p>Greentube has been actively looking to advance its standing in the industry. The company acquired a controlling stake in Alteatec, an iGaming system, and platform provider for the industry. The company similarly introduced its namesake Greentube Mynt, a new tech stack designed to help produce and supply games.</p>
