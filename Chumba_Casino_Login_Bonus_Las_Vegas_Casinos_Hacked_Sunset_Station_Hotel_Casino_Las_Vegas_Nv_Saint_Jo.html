<p>Push Gaming has announced the upcoming launch of Shamrock Saints, a new 5x4 video slot with 20 winlines, a maximum win of 10,000x, Tokens, Chest Feature, and an innovative approach to the popular theme</p>
<p>The supplier of online and mobile games to the betting and gaming industry committed to offering “the best entertainment out there for players to enjoy,” Push Gaming, has announced the upcoming release of its own leprechaun-themed slot version, Shamrock Saints.</p>
<p>The provider with a portfolio boasting iconic titles that have captivated players from all parts of the world has once again set high expectations for its freshest creation with an announced official release date of March 5, 2024.</p>
<p>The innovative supplier of business-to-business content for the online casino market also ushered in the acquisition of its operations by LeoVegas Group and MGM Resorts International in September.</p>
<p>Before that, at the start of July, Push Gaming inked a content partnership agreement with bet365, marking another crucial milestone for the provider.</p>

<p>Enter the Mysterious World of Mischievous Irish Folklore Sprites</p>
<p>The studio decided to step out of the box and explore a never-tackled-before side of leprechauns that no other provider has touched on so far.</p>
<p>The vividly colored video slot closely follows the antics of a foolish gang of noisy leprechauns determined to go on plundering and drinking sprees in the local tavern that they have taken over.</p>
<p>The mix between the fiery faeries and the gold has determined some of the most important elements of the game like the Chest Feature and the Tokens.</p>
<p>Fans of Push Gaming slots should have an easy time recognizing these popular mechanics from previous titles including some of the studio’s most popular releases, Razor Shark with the Razor Reveal feature and Mystery Symbols, and Wild Swarm with collectibles, the Chest feature, and Swarm Mode.</p>
<p>Now, the two elements have been cleverly mixed into the 5×4 slot with 20 winlines and a maximum win capped at 10,000x, resulting in an eye-catching, adrenaline-pumping gambling experience for fans of these older games and newbies alike.</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s game producer, Anastasiia Mysan, explained the studio’s desire to “create a lively game full of action” while praising the gang-themed design, easily recognizable soundtrack, and numerous features hand-picked to accomplish their goal.</p>
<p>Mysan also spoke about the fusion of their previous successes used to create a theme that has never been explored in the past, resulting in a game with “irresistible charm and explosive gameplay” prone to put a smile on players’ faces.</p>
<p>At the end of June, Push Gaming strengthened its foothold in the Nordics while reinforcing Chanz as a leading local brand there through a newly inked multi-market deal with the gambling operator.</p>
