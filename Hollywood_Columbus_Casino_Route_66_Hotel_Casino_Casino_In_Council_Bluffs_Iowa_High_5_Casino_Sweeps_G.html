    <h1>Hollywood Columbus Casino Route 66 Hotel Casino Casino In Council Bluffs Iowa High 5 Casino Sweeps G</h1>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us.</p>
<p>We are genuinely sorry for the frustration that Jacielliy has experienced with their withdrawal requests.</p>
<p>It is important to us that our players have a fair and transparent experience.</p>
<p>Our records show that a withdrawal request was declined on 2023-12-03 for the value of BRL 930.00</p>
<p>The deposit amount of BRL 25.00 was returned to the player’s Casino Account and the winnings were voided.</p>
<p>The above actions were taken as when reviewing the player’s Game History, we found that bets were placed larger than 10% of the bonus amount.</p>
<p>The player made a deposit of 75 BRL which claimed a bonus of 10 BRL</p>
<p>Therefore the maximum bet that could be placed was 1 BRL</p>
<p>The Game History reflected bets made to the values of 1.75 BRL, 1.25 BRL, 1.5 BRL, 2 BRL, 3 BRL and 5 BRL</p>
<p>This can be seen in the Transaction History of the player’s account.</p>
<p>The Game history can also be sent to you if needed.</p>
<p>The Bonus Terms and Conditions state the following:</p>
<p>The following wagering activities are not allowed until the wagering requirements of this bonus have been completed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Betting more than 19.00 BRL per spin or 10% of the received bonus amount (the smaller of the two) on a slot game</li>
</ol>
<p>If, on review of your wagering activities, it is found that you have performed one of the above, your winnings will be removed.</p>
<p>The General Terms and Conditions apply.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions for each bonus are found on every bonus page of our casino.</p>
<p>They are therefore available to all players to read before purchasing and playing the bonuses.</p>
<p>If, on review of the wagering activities, it is found that the Terms and Conditions were not honored, the winnings will be removed.</p>
<p>By claiming the bonus, the terms and conditions of this bonus have been accepted, which includes the maximum withdrawal clause.</p>
<p>If anything further is needed, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Boo Casino Representative</p>
