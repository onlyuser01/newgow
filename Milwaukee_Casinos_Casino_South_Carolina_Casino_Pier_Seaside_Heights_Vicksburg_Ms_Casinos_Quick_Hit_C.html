<p>Leading daily fantasy and sports betting operator DraftKings announced it would launch mobile sports betting operations in New York on Saturday to become one of the first online sportsbooks in the state.</p>
<p>Ready to Launch</p>
<p>The announcement confirming Boston-based DraftKings is ready to go live with online and mobile sports betting in New York at the time of the official state launch came following news that the New York State (NYS) Gambling Commission set Saturday, January 8, 2022, as the official start day of mobile sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The Empire State regulator approved four operators among which DraftKings to start accepting and processing mobile and online wagers on sports after mobile wagering became legal in April last year.</p>
<p>The official launch date comes just ahead of the NFL Playoffs, one of the busiest periods of the sporting calendar in terms of betting that will guarantee a strong start for operators ready to go live.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins expressed his “special thanks to Governor Hochul, Senator Addabbo, Assemblyman Pretlow, [and] the New York Gaming Commission” for their efforts to make mobile sports betting in New York a reality.</p>
<p>“As a longtime Boston sports fan, I can personally attest to countless fiery rivalries against various New York teams, and that passion is what makes these fanbases so special within this globally revered sports entertainment mecca.” Jason Robins, CEO, DraftKings</p>
<p>He also outlined the “tireless efforts” of the dedicated team at DraftKings that contributed to the opportunity for the operator to be among the first to launch mobile and online operations in the state.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to bring new levels of access and immersive engagement to New Yorkers with the arrival of mobile sports betting,” concluded the co-founder and chairman of the board at DraftKings Robins.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Robins held a controversial speech at a Cannacord investor summit and threw serious doubts on the ambitions of the company in New York by stating it would not spend aggressively for customer acquisition. He even implied New Yorkers would most probably continue to wager in neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut.</p>
<p>Teasing New Yorkers</p>
<p>Director of Race and Sportsbook Operations at DraftKings Johnny Avello also commented on the announcement focusing on DraftKings Sportsbook’s advantages, customer services, real-money gaming and entertainment, teasing bettors in New York anticipating the impending launch.</p>
<p>“Growing up in New York and having spent the last 30-plus years in Las Vegas, I am thrilled that my worlds are finally set to collide.” Johnny Avello, Director, Race and Sportsbook Operations, DraftKings</p>
<p>New York is the largest US jurisdiction to introduce mobile and online sports betting to date and many predict the state is set to dwarf the other states in terms of revenue. With 10 professional sports teams from six major leagues, as well as an additional three teams located in close vicinity to the city, New York is home to millions of passionate sports fans.</p>
