<p>On Tuesday, the Washington Nationals battled back with a three-run 8th inning to top the Milwaukee Brewers 4-3 in the National League Wild Card Game. Last night, the Tampa Bay Rays easily took care of the Oakland Athletics 5-1 in the AL Wild Card.</p>
<p>Now, it’s off to the four best-of-five Division Series. The Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas has the home teams favored in each – the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, and Houston Astros.</p>
<p>Only eight teams can win the World Series, and it’s Houston with the shortest odds heading into the Division Series at 2/1. Los Angeles is next at 5/2, followed by New York (4/1), Atlanta (10/1), St. Louis and Washington (12/1), Minnesota (14/1), and Tampa Ray the longest at 18/1.</p>
<p>One of the largest sports bets in US history was placed this week at the DraftKings sportsbook at the Scarlet Pearl Casino in Mississippi. Houston mattress businessman Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale wagered $3.5 million on the Astros winning the World Series on +220 odds, which would net $7.7 million.</p>
<p>The large bet is a partial hedge of a promotion he ran at his Gallery Furniture stores earlier in the year that said all purchases over $3,000 would be refunded if Houston wins the title. McIngvale says he’s on the hook for more than $15 million in refunds if they do.</p>
<p>NL Division MLB Odds</p>
<p>The National Leagues gets its two Division Series underway this evening.</p>
<p>The St. Louis Cardinals and Braves are up first. The SuperBook has the series price St. Louis +120, Atlanta -140.</p>
<p>Game 1 first pitch is scheduled for 5:02 pm ET in Atlanta, with Miles Mikolas on the mound for the visitors and Dallas Keuchel tossing for the Braves. The line has Atlanta favored at -138, and the over/under at 9.5 runs.</p>
<p>The Nationals play at the Dodgers in their best-of-five, with Los Angeles heavily favored in the series at -230, to Washington at +120. A $100 bet on the Dodgers nets just $43.48 should they advance to the National League Championship Series.</p>
<p>Game 1 first pitch is 8:37 pm ET. Patrick Corbin is on the mound for the Nats, and Walker Buehler for the Dodgers. The game line is LA -170, and over/under 7.5.</p>
<p>AL Betting Preview</p>
<p>Tampa Bay travels to Texas to take on the Astros. Houston is the biggest series favorite in the four Division Series match-ups at -250, Tampa Bay +200. A $100 bet nets $40.</p>
<p>Game 1 (2:05 pm ET Friday) features Tyler Glasnow against Rays veteran Justin Verlander. The Astros are favored -210, and the over/under at seven runs.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Twins head to New York for the Yankees tomorrow. The Bronx Bombers are strong series favorites at -240, and Minnesota +190.</p>
<p>Game one will pit Twins’ Jose Berrios against the Yanks’ James Paxton. New York is favored at -180, and the over-under 9.5.</p>
