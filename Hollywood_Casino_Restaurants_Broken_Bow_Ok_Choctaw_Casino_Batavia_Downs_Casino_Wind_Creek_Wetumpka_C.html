<p>New York Giants Might be Playoff Imposters</p>
<p>The New York Giants should feel more than happy for getting to the postseason. Their roster just isn’t great in the 2022-23 season, and if it weren’t for a superb run at the start of the campaign, they wouldn’t get nowhere near the playoffs.</p>
<p>However, they got themselves a Wild Card entry in Brian Daboll’s first season as the Giants’ boss. Not only that, but they defeated the Vikings in their first postseason game since 2017, despite coming to Minneapolis as underdogs. We did, however, predict that they’re going to cause an upset. Our reasoning wasn’t that they’re a brilliant team; instead, we just didn’t have much faith in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Although we do think that the Giants have a couple of amazing players with a brilliant future in the NFL, we just don’t see them as playoff material, at least not yet.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles Already Thinking About NFC Championship</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles cruised through the regular season as the most impressive NFC team. They ended on a 14-3 record, with two losses happening in the final three rounds of the season – when it was already clear the Birds from Philly were going to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>They played two games against their NFC East rivals – the New York Giants – in 2022, winning both times. The first game happened in Week 14 when we saw Philadelphia blow out New York 48-22. In Week 18, they met again, but this time, it was a much more modest win for the Eagles (22-16).</p>
<p>We suspect that they’re going to take a similar approach in the Divisional game. Rather than going for another blowout win, the Eagles are probably going to try to keep the ball in their hands for a long time, focusing on runs by Pro Bowlers Miles Sanders (RB) and Jalen Hurts (QB).</p>
<p>New York Giants vs Philadelphia Eagles Prediction</p>
<p>The Giants just aren’t a great team. They got to the Divisional Round by going all-in against the Vikings, but we can’t see them doing the same again. Instead, we expect to see them lose to the Eagles for the third time in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>Still, this probably won’t be a blowout win for the Eagles. In fact, we expect them to win by no more than one TD.</p>
<p>Picks: Philadelphia Eagles to win but not cover the spread; under to hit</p>
