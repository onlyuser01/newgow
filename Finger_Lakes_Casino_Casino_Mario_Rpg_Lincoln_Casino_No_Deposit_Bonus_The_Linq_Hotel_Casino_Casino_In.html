<p>Imani Holly, 19, was apprehended in Knoxville, Tenn., according to Tennessee’s WHBQ TV station.</p>
<p>He was booked on four counts of attempted murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder, according to the report.</p>
<p>If convicted, Holly could be sentenced to several years in prison.</p>
<p>Holly allegedly shot the victims in the parking lot of the Tunica gaming property. One of the victims contacted the Tunica County Sheriff’s Office after she and the three others were wounded by several bullets.</p>
<p>They were in the lot walking toward the casino when they were wounded. Their injuries weren’t life-threatening, but each required treatment at Mississippi’s Regional One Hospital.</p>
<p>Holly and possibly other suspects fled in a white Infiniti with a Mississippi license plate, according to WMC, a Tennessee TV station.</p>
<p>The casino is located near the Mississippi River, some 30 miles south of Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p>In 2021, Holly was arrested for several armed robberies at businesses in Tate County, Mississippi, WHBQ reported. He was arrested for similar charges in Memphis in July 2022, authorities added.</p>
<p>Holly allegedly failed to show up at court to face the charges after posting bond.</p>
<p>Casino Troopers Assaulted, Spit On</p>
<p>Troopers responding to Hollywood Casino at Greektown in Detroit were allegedly assaulted by two women late on Saturday morning. One of the women also spit at a Metro South trooper during the confrontation.</p>
<p>Troopers went to the gaming property after one of the women became angry while on the casino floor.</p>
<p>The officers tried to speak with the angry woman. But during the exchange, she spit on one of the troopers, authorities said.</p>
<p>A second woman allegedly assaulted a trooper while the officer was arresting the woman who had spit.</p>
<p>Neither of the suspects were injured. They were 21 and 22 years of age.</p>
<p>Neither woman was identified in a report from Click on Detroit, a regional news site.</p>
<p>Man in Bunny Mask Robs Casino</p>
<p>Rapid City, South Dakota police are searching for a bandit wearing a bunny mask who recently held up a local casino.</p>

<p>Police didn’t reveal how much money was stolen, and it doesn’t appear that anyone was injured during the incident. It’s unclear if a weapon was used in the robbery.</p>
<p>The incident was reported by television station KELO on September 7.</p>
