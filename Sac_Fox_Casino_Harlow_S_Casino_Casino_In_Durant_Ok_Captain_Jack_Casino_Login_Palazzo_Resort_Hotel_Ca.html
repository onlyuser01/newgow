    <h1>Sac Fox Casino Harlow S Casino Casino In Durant Ok Captain Jack Casino Login Palazzo Resort Hotel Ca</h1>

<p>Tried to withdrawal $11000 of winnings. After a 2 week review period they said there was a chargeback and my funds were confiscated. I don't use a Credit Card and only deposit by idebit and e-check. On june 11 idebit withdrew $301.50 which was NSF. I contacted them and they took payment out again on June 15th. I uploaded my bank statement showing that it was not a chargeback and that it was paid on the 15.</p>
<p>They told me winnings confiscated due to chargebacks that had to be paid back. I am being screwed I think. Can you guys help me</p>
