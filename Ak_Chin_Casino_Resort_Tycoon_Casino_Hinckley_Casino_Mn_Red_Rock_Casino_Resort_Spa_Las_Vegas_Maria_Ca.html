<p>The first PACOOP online event was incredibly succesful, attracting over 12,000 to 50 events.</p>
<p>PokerStars’ PACOOP Exceeds Prize Pool by 27%</p>
<p>PokerStars recently closed its first-ever PACOOP (Pennsylvania Championship of Online Poker), and the debut of the event was ground-breaking. With a prize pool worth well over $1 million and over ten thousand entries, the PACOOP turned out to be a huge success – but, was there ever any doubt?</p>
<p>The PACOOP wasn’t announced very long before the event was set to begin, but it managed to attract a huge pool of players. The original overall guarantee was $1.225 million – but the events ended up accumulating a pool of $1.55 million give away to players.</p>
<p>Over 50 events were held during the PACOOP, which brought in 12,612 entries. Many of these events vastly exceeded their guarantees, so players were in for a big treat as they competed for some very generous prizes.</p>
<p>The First-Ever PACOOP Main Event</p>
<p>The PACOOP’s Main Event was a fantastic tournament, with a $300 buy-in and offering a $125,000 prize pool. It was the largest tournament ever launched by PokerStars since the site went live in Pennsylvania, so it wasn’t surprising that its guarantee was vastly exceeded.</p>
<p>640 players entered the Main Event, 420 of which were unique players and 220 were re-entries. This resulted in a prize pool worth $179,200.</p>
<p>The PACOOP Main Event took place over the course of the two days, with a player named Gyea08 coming out as the winner. He landed a generous prize worth over $31,000. The runner up was lilholdem952, who received $22,000 for his second-place prize.</p>
<p>Other Big Events</p>
<p>Another important event in the PACOOP was #45 which had a $50 buy-in. It brought in the most runners of all of this year’s PACOOP events with 830 entries. They generated a prize pool of more than $37,000.</p>
<p>We also saw the first Zoom tournament – a unique fast-fold poker event. The buy-in was $75, and 395 players entered. The guarantee was $10,000 but ended up at over $25,000.</p>
<p>Overall, the PACOOP exceeded its guarantee by 27%. So, it’s safe to say that the inaugural event was a tremendous success.</p>
<p>This really sets the tone for PokerStars’ entry into Pennsylvania’s gambling market. With a fantastic PACOOP event behind it, the brand has established itself as a leader in the Pennsylvanian poker world. It has ended the year off with a bang, so we’re going to be looking forward to what PokerStars has to offer in 2020.</p>
