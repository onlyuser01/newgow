<p>The international sports betting and gambling company Entain has launched a new corporate sustainability reporting directive by the name EnTrain. It aims to improve access to technology for marginalized and underrepresented communities.</p>
<p>Impacting Over a Million People</p>
<p>According to Entain, the CSR directive’s goal is to have a positive impact on the lives of over 1 million people worldwide by 2030.</p>
<p>Entain’s chief executive officer, Jette Nygaard-Andersen spoke on the matter. She pointed out that Entain is an ambitious business that values sustainability as one of its two core pillars. Because of it, Entain has a lot to benefit from improving the standard of life of the wider communities it is a part of.</p>
<p>Nygaard-Andersen shared that she passionately believes that Entain is going to have a vital role to play in inspiring the next generation to follow a career in technology.</p>
<p>“As we reshape the future of interactive entertainment, we also want to help many more people become involved,” she explained.</p>
<p>Nygaard-Andersen added that the EnTrain initiative provides “the building blocks” to help more people become involved in this. The CSR directive will do so by providing people with the necessary training and equipment that they need to succeed.</p>
<p>Nygaard-Andersen concluded that Entain’s commitment to safer gambling is a testament to the company’s ambition of becoming an ESG leader. Entain has already done a lot to relieve gambling harm and Nygaard-Andersen believes that this success can be replicated in the company’s endeavors of diversifying the industry.</p>
<p>EnTrain is Already Reaching Worldwide</p>
<p>Entain has decided to reinforce its new initiative through five CSR partnerships with several notable firms and organizations across the world.</p>
<p>One of them is the British Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust, through which Entain will sponsor nine tech apprenticeships.</p>
<p>Additionally, the sports betting company will adopt a training and mentorship program that has been developed by Berlin’s University of Technology and the Nexus Institute.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Entain will join hands with the Colombian non-profit sports organization Tiempo de Juego to launch an all-female football team in the country.</p>
<p>Going forward, the sports and betting company will launch a scholarship program together with the University of Nevada Las Vegas that will support people who have an interest in working within the gambling sector.</p>
<p>Lastly, Entain will extend its reach to Australia, where it will sit in charge of the Pathways Academy education program and work to diversify it by introducing more underrepresented groups to it.</p>
<p>Entain has seen tremendous success throughout the year. The EnTrain program shows the company’s dedication to sharing it with others.</p>
