<p>Parimatch Tech, the parent company of CIS sports betting operator Parimatch, announced several structural changes to its senior management team that will see the business shift to sole chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Moving to Single Management Model</p>
<p>Following the decision of co-CEO Roman Syrotian to step down from the executive position and assume a board supervisory role, Maksym Liashko, co-CEO alongside Syrotian since April 2021, will become the company’s sole chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Commenting on his new position, Liashko outlined the war in Ukraine as the main driver behind the reshuffling, as “structure and development procedures within the company had to be reviewed and adapted to the new reality.”</p>
<p>“With Roman refocusing all his attention and skills toward the Supervisory Board activities, I am certain that Parimatch Tech will withstand these difficult times and continue to be a successful global business.” Maksym Liashko, CEO, Parimatch Tech</p>
<p>Other Promotions</p>
<p>Liashko went on to congratulate Anna Motruk and Evgen Belousov, who were appointed as Deputy CEOs, outlining their “knowledge and skills” as instrumental in shaping Parimatch Tech into the “successful international business” it is now.</p>
<p>Motruk and Belousov are being promoted to Deputy CEOs, having served as chief financial offer and chief revenue officer, respectively, to support Liashko’s efforts to lead the business in these turbulent times.</p>
<p>Former co-CEO Syrotian, who decided to focus on the strategic direction of the company in terms of future options, shareholder relations and resource allocation, also commented on the restructuring, outlining the “changes in the top management structure and move to the single CEO model” would enable the business to “become even more flexible” by speeding up decision-making and processes within operations.</p>
<p>“I’m confident that Maksym and the team are ready to lead Parimatch Tech during these tough times. I will continue my work in the company in a non-operational role as a member of the Supervisory Board.” Roman Syrotian, Parimatch Tech</p>
<p>Last month, Parimatch Tech finalized its withdrawal from the Russian market as a response to the invasion of Ukraine. Founded in Ukraine, the business joined a plethora of international companies which decided to cease operations in Russia, condemning the war.</p>
<p>Parimatch Tech also donated $2 million to support the country torn out by the military conflict.</p>
