<p>Official confirmation from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been received, stating that membership in Tribal-ISAC is considered an approved expense within the grant program</p>
<p>The Tribal Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Tribal-ISAC) announced on November 15 a significant stride in facilitating cybersecurity readiness for Native American and Alaskan Native tribes. The organization disclosed that its membership is recognized as an allowable expense, covered by funds from The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Fiscal Year 2023 Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program (TCGP).</p>
<p>Tribal-ISAC Steering Committee Excited Over Recognition in Cybersecurity Grant Program</p>
<p>Toni Pepper, a Tribal-ISAC Steering Committee member, commented: “We were very excited to learn that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) lists the Tribal-ISAC as an Encouraged Membership as noted on page 77 of the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).”</p>
<p>Pepper further emphasized that the security of tribal data and infrastructure holds paramount importance, expressing excitement about rendering Tribal-ISAC membership more accessible to tribes through the grant program.</p>
<p>FEMA has officially confirmed that Tribal-ISAC membership is an approved expense under the grant program.</p>
<p>The alarming surge in cyber attacks and digital threats affecting tribal communities underscores the urgency for enhanced cybersecurity measures. Tribal sovereignty, coupled with the unique challenges posed by remote tribal locations and limited resources for cyber preparedness, necessitates immediate action. The TCGP funds will play a crucial role in assisting tribal governments in addressing cybersecurity risks and threats.</p>
<p>Despite implementing robust safeguards, even major corporations are susceptible to cyberattacks. Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International, two of the most prominent gambling entities in the US, became victims of cyberattacks this fall. The infiltrations believed to be orchestrated by the ALPHV and Scattered Spider groups, resulted in the compromise of valuable data as the hackers breached the companies’ cybersecurity defenses.</p>
<p>TribalHub Hosts Open Meeting on November 27 to Enhance Collaboration</p>
<p>For tribes interested in applying for the DHS Fiscal Year 2023 Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program, the application deadline is January 10, 2024.</p>
<p>To further facilitate understanding and collaboration, TribalHub, the largest community of technology-minded tribal leaders nationwide, is hosting an open meeting on November 27. This session, conducted in collaboration with FEMA, aims to provide tribal government representatives and organizations with the opportunity to learn, inquire, and establish connections that will aid in the application process for the DHS Fiscal Year 2023 Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program.</p>
<p>Tribal-ISAC is committed to improving the overall security of tribes, with a focus on cybersecurity and all-hazard threats and risks. The organization provides a collaborative environment for tribes to share and mitigate threat information, exchange best practices, and serve as a central hub for security information sharing.</p>
