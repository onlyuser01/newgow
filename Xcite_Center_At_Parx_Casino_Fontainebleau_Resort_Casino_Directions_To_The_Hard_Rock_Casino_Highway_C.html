    <h1>Xcite Center At Parx Casino Fontainebleau Resort Casino Directions To The Hard Rock Casino Highway C</h1>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>stumbled on this thread and hoping someone can help me too please.</p>
<p>I have a withdrawal pending since 18 December and also at status "user request awaiting" every time I contact them I get the same robotic replies.</p>
<p>Im getting no response on emails what so ever and they have now changed their domain to mrsloty1.com - which they did communicate via text</p>
<p>I have had two previous successful withdrawals without any issues and my account was verified long ago. I’m not trying to withdraw £5000 and don’t seem to be getting anywhere.</p>
<p>obviously, I have since looked online and it seems everyone is having the same issues. It’s nice to see you two did get paid out and wondered if you could offer any advice at all</p>
<p>I’m torn between waiting for my winnings or doing a chargeback with my bank for the deposits and take the loss</p>
