<p>Catena Media has promoted Craig Harman as its new head of product. The company is doubling down on its commitment to nurture its talent internally and offer promising employees and executives more responsibilities that align with their personal goals and the company’s broader outlook for the industry and its place in it.</p>
<p>Harman an Important Internal Asset</p>
<p>Harman is an important part of Catena Media already. He served as the head of product development for the EMEA region between April 2021 and June 2022. He joined back in 2017 and by March 2018, he was already promoted to the senior product owner. After years of hard work, Harman was quickly entrusted with an even more important position in the company.</p>
<p>He became global head of sports products and he took charge of the affiliate business as the company sought to capitalize on the rapid expansion of the North American sports betting market. Since October 2019, he has been helping Catena Media establish itself in both the European and American markets.</p>
<p>Stepping into this new position, Harman said he was thrilled to be a part of the team and continue spearheading the company’s success. He added:</p>
<p>“Thank you Catena Media for this fantastic opportunity. The best place to work is a place where you can be your best.” Catena Media Head of Product Craig Harman</p>
<p>Catena Focused on Success with Its Team</p>
<p>Internal hires are an important part of the experience for Catena Media. The company has been relying on its own internally trained and trustworthy individuals to bring success to bear as opposed to looking for third-party professionals in most cases.</p>
<p>Catena Media posted strong results in the first quarter of the year reflecting the performance marketing agency’s strength and deep understanding of the markets it operates.</p>
<p>In May, though, the company signaled that it may be open to offloading some of its assets as it seeks to streamline the portfolio and pivot on a stronger foothold toward what’s next for the gambling industry.</p>
