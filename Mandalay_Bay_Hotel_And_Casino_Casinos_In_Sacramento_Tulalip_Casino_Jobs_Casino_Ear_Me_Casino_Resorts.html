    <h1>Mandalay Bay Hotel And Casino Casinos In Sacramento Tulalip Casino Jobs Casino Ear Me Casino Resorts</h1>

<p>I set up an account for this casino without any problems on 9.2.2021. Deposit to the gaming account via trustly € 112 without any problems. I played for a few hours mainly roulette slot machines and live roulette. I managed to win and 10.2. 2021 when it came time for my withdrawal profits problems started: The withdrawal click still worked, but when it was time to choose the withdrawal method, then all the options were black! So I couldn’t even click on the withdrawal to initiate. This was new to me, and has not come across any similar in the past. Customer service responded to the chat soon and said there was a technical problem. Gave instructions e.g. clearing cookies, changing browsers, logging in, etc.</p>
<p>This discussion took place in customer service throughout the day 10 &amp; 11.2. The cause was a technical problem that had reportedly been passed on. Nothing "official" came, and nothing concrete. No one was contacted and no attempt was made to contact me for any technical support. Copies of all conversations are emailed as a recording.</p>
<p>However, I was dissatisfied with handling this matter and said I wanted to close my account because I would not otherwise be able to cash out my profits. This was done on February 11, 2021 and my account has now been terminated. There has been no message about my money or how it was paid.</p>
<p>The casino is owned by N1 Interactive Ltd. casino family and I have previously in recent history, wanted to stop their casino accounts with their own desire to REASON THAT "IT'S NOT ONLY WANT TO LEAVE". I could also ask to close other casino family accounts and ads for the same reason. (Despite this, ads, etc. have not run out.) I ALSO REQUESTED THAT I NOT ALLOW ME TO OPEN NEW ACCOUNTS. I know that if the reason had been, for example, gambling problems, etc., it could be a reason to refuse to pay me money, but this has not been the case anywhere. For example, I have not said that I want to close all accounts forever or for no exact time at all. Plus, the casino hasn’t relied on anything like this! So far, I have been told nothing but a technical failure.</p>
<p>If you close yourself from a gaming account with Finnish Veikkaus, the casino will immediately notify you by official mail and return the funds in the gaming account as soon as possible. According to customer service, Winny.com casino also reportedly works, but I don't have the money.</p>
<p>How are you doing? Am I reporting a crime to Malta or?</p>
<p>I CANNOT ADD ATTACHMENTS I WOULD LIKE. DECLARES THAT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ANNEXES HAS BEEN EXCEEDED.</p>
