<p>Raphael Di Guisto, Silverback Gaming’s founder, acknowledged that Egypt is a popular theme for slots. However, he added that the company implemented its own twist that grants players a chance to unlock big treasures. “This is a volatile, bonus-heavy slot that will appeal to adventurous players that love the anticipation and excitement that Wilds, Multipliers, Free Spins and Respins provide,” added Di Guisto.</p>
<p>Di Guisto noted that Egyptian Mega Fortune is designed in a way to appeal to audiences in North America. However, he predicted a wide range of audiences will like the new game that offers chances for big payouts and a recognizable theme.</p>
<p>“Egypt is a classic slot theme, but we have put our own twist on the genre with gameplay that offers plenty of treasures to unlock.“ Raphael Di Guisto, founder at Silverback Gaming</p>
<p>To trigger Respins, Egyptian Mega Fortune players need to land two or more Coin symbols on the reels. Engaging in this mode will award the players three respins and “then all the symbol positions apart from the Coins respin with additional Coins containing cash prizes appearing,” explained the game developer.</p>
<p>Landing three Scatter symbols enables a Free Spins bonus round for the players. While in this game mode, online players can also flip a coin that can award up to three more Free Spins. To further elevate the experience for the players, the coin flips come with multipliers such as x1 Multiplier for the first coin spin, x2 Multiplier for the second and so on.</p>
