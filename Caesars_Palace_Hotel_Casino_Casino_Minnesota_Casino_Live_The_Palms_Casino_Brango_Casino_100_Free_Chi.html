<p>The Sharks have chosen Hollywoodbets to be their new title sponsor, taking their partnership started in 2019 one step further</p>
<p>The South African Rugby Union team that scooped up the Currie Cup on eight different occasions and steadily turned from a provincial rugby brand to a commercially recognized sporting brand with a global reputation, The Sharks, has appointed Hollywoodbets as their new title sponsor.</p>
<p>The collaboration with the sports betting operator in South Africa that provides online, telephone, and mobile phone betting options started four years ago, in 2019. The new extension of their partnership also includes the stadium naming rights of the Hollywoodbets Kings Park.</p>
<p>Last December, Hollywoodbets announced it would launch Hybrid Sports League and BetGames’ live sports vertical, Twain Sport, on African markets.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets, “Massive Sharks Fans”</p>
<p>As explained by Hollywoodbets’ brand and communication manager, Devin Heffer, the Durban-born and based operator is a “massive” fan of the rugby team that acknowledges the meaning of the to its fans and the way it has turned into an important institution of the province.</p>
<p>By harnessing the “passion and energy” that Hollywoodbets constantly invests in each new sponsorship, Heffer expects to further boost the team’s supporter experience as well as their position as one of the easiest recognizable rugby brands on the planet.</p>
<p>The brand manager also acknowledged the shared many values that the two parties have in common, including their interest in the development of sports and community support.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets’ Logo on the Front and Back of The Sharks’ Jerseys</p>
<p>According to the terms of the new title sponsor agreement, from the 2023/24 season, the Hollywoodbets logo will be featured on both the front and back of the rugby team’s playing jerseys during all upcoming competitions.</p>
<p>The newly imprinted jerseys will also be available for sale at the beginning of October. Even more, the sports operator will prepare a plethora of “thrilling activations and engagements” for fans of the team.</p>
<p>The Sharks’ chief executive officer, Dr Eduard Coetzee, commented on the announcement, expressing delight and reiterating the “unwavering support, commitment to excellence, and investment” proven by the operator in the past years that the team was looking forward to seeing growth even more in the future.</p>
<p>Coetzee also praised the international footprint and appeal of both brands, calling the new chapter of their partnership “a momentous occasion” for the sporting and entertainment communities worldwide.</p>
<p>At the same time, the CEO took the opportunity to acknowledge their outgoing title sponsor, Cell C, for their important contribution as title sponsor in the past 10 years while expressing their joy for them continuing to be a part of “the family” from their new role as an Official Partner.</p>
<p>At the start of July, Hollywoodbets inked an agreement with ClearStake, further proving and strengthening its commitment to safe player experiences.</p>
