<p>US-based sports betting and iGaming giant WynnBet is tapping into more sports talent to represent its brand with the additions of Mangold, Howard, and Johnson.</p>
<p>WynnBET Is Focusing on Boosting Brand Visibility</p>
<p>WynnBET is expanding its list of ambassadors following a Wednesday announcement that Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, Tim Howard, and Nick Mangold will now all represent the brand in various ways. The trio of sports legends will be helping WynnBET boost awareness for its sports and gaming brands as they attend events in-person to help promote the company’s dedicated app.</p>
<p>They will be seen at the Blue Wire Podcast Studio at Wynn Las Vegas. Every person on the list is known in the sports society and their respective fields. Johnson is an 11-season NFL veteran, having played for the Cincinnati Bengals and the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>After his retirement from professional football, Johnson became an influential figure in social media and quickly gaining popularity again when he agreed to participate in an exhibition boxing match in June. “This is all about connecting directly with sports betting fans to provide great entertainment and conversation through social media and in-person events,” Johnson explained in a brief statement.</p>
<p>Wynn is also interested in giving back, and the company will assist Johnson with his charitable initiatives, many of which are based in his hometown in Miami, Florida.</p>
<p>It’s All About Connecting to Fans And Betting</p>
<p>Then, there is Tim Howard, a soccer ace who made it to the English Premier League, where he played for the Red Devils. “I’m excited to join the WynnBET team, one of the most recognized names in sports and entertainment. With MLS continually growing in popularity, I look forward to sharing my game previews and parlay picks with WynnBET customers,” Howard said.</p>
<p>As to Mangold, the former football legend for the New York Jets is interested in further developing his profile and continuing to support the Jets through all means possible. Mangold said that he had played football his entire life, but he never realized how fun it could be betting on games.</p>
<p>“The WynnBET app makes that easy for me in my current home state of New Jersey. I’m excited to partner with WynnBET to let fans know what an entertaining and user-friendly experience the app provides,” he informed, signaling his satisfaction with the solution and inviting others to have a shot.</p>
<p>WynnBET has been expanding quickly across the US. The company teamed up with MLB’s Colorado Rockies and planned an Arizona market access deal. Wynn has been actively pursuing many partnership opportunities and not least with the Memphis Grizzlies and Cincinnati Reds, while going live in Indiana, Tennessee and elsewhere this year.</p>
