    <h1>Casinos In Biloxi Ms Casinos In Alabama Treasure Island Hotel Casino Cherry Casino Play Casino Games</h1>

<p>The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>On October 13, I saw a video on YouTube with Gamblestakes casino. Immediately registered in this casino. I started playing at this casino. But today it all ended and it ended in a scam.</p>
<p>During this time, quite a lot of deposits and withdrawals have been made in Gamblestakes casinos. I played and did not experience any difficulties. Yesterday I also made a few deposits, it's funny, I wanted to try myself as a streamer, or at least to start, just record a video with the opening of bonus rounds in slots. At Gamblestakes Casino, I had $900 real money on my balance. I caught bonus rounds in 24 different slots in order to wager them later on the broadcast or just record a video with the opening of these bonus rounds.</p>
<p>But today, 12/07/2022, I tried to log into my account and found out that my account was disabled.</p>
<p>When I contacted support, I found out the following:</p>
<p>"Hey, we have received a complaint of our game provider stating that we are unable to provide service to many countries included Belarus, in case you're not currently in Belarus, please provide your ID to have your account relocated and re enabled. If you are in Belarus, please let me know so we can make a ticket and get your situation resolved."</p>
<p>I answered that I am from Belarus</p>
<p>They answered me many times, but the answer is about the same:</p>
<p>"We greatly apologize but Belarus is not an authorized country to be on our site. You can review the unauthorized locations in our TOS which you can find at https://gamblestakes.com/en/contacts/terms-and-conditions"</p>
<p>If anyone is interested, I can publish the entire correspondence.</p>
<p>To my question about how should I deal with the fact that I risked my money and I still have 24 slots with unfinished bonus rounds and I would like to receive this money (yes, the stakes are small 0.50$-0.80$, but 24 slots with bonus rounds at these stakes, the potential winnings from these games are a tangible amount of money for me).</p>
<p>They answered me:</p>
<p>"I see you have deposited 950$ and withdrawal $1.6k You have recieved more than deposited so atleast you made some money. But we greatly apologize for this."</p>
<p>But It doesn't matter that I "made some money on it" - after all, this is a casino, I could lose. I risked my money. so this is not an argument.</p>
<p>I understand that it is unlikely that anyone from the administration will consider this situation.</p>
<p>So I will file complaints against all gambling resources known to me, such as: bitcointalk, casino.guru, lcb, askgamblers, chipy etc., I will also file a complaint with licensee. As well as game providers where I have unfinished rounds (pragmatic play). At a minimum, they should report the exact amount of unfinished rounds if possible.</p>
<p>I play in many casinos, but this is the first time I see such an attitude. Many casinos are trying in every possible way to resolve such situations in order not to spoil their reputation.</p>
<p>And in the gamblingstakes casino they just blocked me and deprived me of my money.</p>
<p>By the way, I was removed from the Gamblestakes casino channel in the discord for this message.</p>
<p>Я играла на свои, без бонуса.</p>
<p>Изначально я поставила 900$ на вывод, но потом отменила этот вывод.</p>
<p>Я поймала на 900$ реальных денег, без бонуса - 24 бонусных раунда в разных слотах исключительно для того, чтобы потом открыть их для видео или стрима (я посмотрела у них в дискорде много кто так делает из стримеров)</p>
<p>За моё сообщение о том что они заблокировали мой аккаунт в казино они меня заблокировали и в своем дискорд канале.</p>
<p>Там кстати мне один из их администраторов предлагал выделить партнерскую ссылку</p>
<p>They wrote that "our system had not detected that Belarus is an unauthorized country and we greatly apologize"</p>
<p>but I initially chose Belarus in the profile in the list of countries.</p>
