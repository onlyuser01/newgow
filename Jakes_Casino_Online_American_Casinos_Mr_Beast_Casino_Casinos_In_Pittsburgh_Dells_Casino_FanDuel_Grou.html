    <h1>Jakes Casino Online American Casinos Mr Beast Casino Casinos In Pittsburgh Dells Casino FanDuel Grou</h1>

<p>FanDuel Group has appointed Dale Hooper as general manager for Canada as the company becomes the latest sports betting organization to set its marks on the burgeoning Canadian gaming market.</p>
<p>Hooper is stepping into a new role within the company where he will be in charge of implementing FanDuel Group’s broader strategy in the Canadian market as the country pushes for clear-cut regulation and continues with the legalization process on a per-province basis.</p>
<p>Valuable Addition to FanDuel Group’s Portfolio in Canada</p>
<p>Coming from Deloitte Canada, Hooper is familiar with the local regulatory and legal landscape and will now seek to help FanDuel implement its sports betting and iGaming offer in Canada. He will work directly under FanDuel Group CEO Amy Howe as the pair focuses on advancing FanDuel’s mission statement in the region. Offering comments on the appointment, Howe had this to add:</p>
<p>“Dale has a proven track record running high growth enterprises along with strong relationships that will be invaluable to our success in Canada.”</p>
<p>Howe further praised Hooper for his ability to lead and scale business units efficiently. Hooper brings a crucial skillset that allows him to build up products and align them with customer expectations, something that will resonate with Canadian citizens.</p>
<p>Hooper’s Wealth of Experience Makes Him a Perfect Fit</p>
<p>Hooper’s own experience spans over 30 years at numerous consumer-driven industries, including a stint at Cannabis Compliance Inc where he served as CEO and president. He helped shape the company into a leader in the regulated cannabis industry, with the firm later acquired by Deloitte.</p>
<p>He has worked for other established companies, including PepsiCo Foods and PepsiCo Beverages, Cadbury Canada, and Rogers Communications to name a few. Hooper shared his own excitement to be part of FanDuel Group and its efforts to break ground into the Canadian iGaming and sports gambling markets.</p>
<p>“I am proud to be joining the industry leader at such a momentous time,” he added. FanDuel is hardly the only company breaking into the Canadian market. Earlier this month, PointsBet Canada appointed Dave Rivers as VP of marketing, a month after bringing in Dale Fallen as senior director of product.</p>
