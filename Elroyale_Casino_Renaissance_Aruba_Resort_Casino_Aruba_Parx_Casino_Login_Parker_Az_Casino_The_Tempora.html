    <h1>Elroyale Casino Renaissance Aruba Resort Casino Aruba Parx Casino Login Parker Az Casino The Tempora</h1>

<p>Dear Li1979,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Withdrawing from Bonus</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A x1 wagering requirement will be attached to all Cash and Cash Back bonuses. Once a player has been granted a cash bonus or a cash back bonus, his withdrawal is limited x10 of the bonus amount and the casino reserves the right to deduct issued Cashback money from pending withdrawals.</p>
<p>Once a player has started playing with a bonus on his balance, his withdrawal is limited to x20 of the deposit currently in play.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Assurance Bonus is restricted to a maximum withdrawal limit of 20x the bonus amount. The bonus amount is non-withdrawable, and the casino reserves the right to deduct issued Cashback money from pending withdrawals."</p>
<p>Could you please advise what was the name of the bonus that you activated with your last deposit?</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
