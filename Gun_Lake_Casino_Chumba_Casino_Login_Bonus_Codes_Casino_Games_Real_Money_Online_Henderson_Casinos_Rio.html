<p>Safari Sam 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around an African Safari.</p>
<p>Set on the African savanna, this game is hosted by an eccentric ranger named Sam. With his help, players will explore a world filled with friendly wild animals and scorching heat.</p>
<p>The whimsical mood of this game provides an exotic escape into a sunny world of adventure.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is made up of percussion beats and animal noises. The lion roar in particular provides a safari-like ambiance. A rainstick rustles when players hit 'spin', adding to the sense that this is an African setting.</p>
<p>The characters of this game are animated with a Pixar-like quality. Sam looks from side to side nervously, while the female guide raises an eyebrow with sassy confidence. Players may begin to have a sense that she’s the one really running the show.</p>
<p>The animal symbols are especially memorable, with a grumpy lion and sly-faced zebra stealing the show. They are accompanied by a host of other safari symbols from rugged vehicles to makeshift tents and a acacia tree silhouetted against a sunset.</p>
<p>Whenever the reels spin, they leave a little trail of dust, adding to the sense that players are riding on dry roads.</p>
<p>The backdrop behind the reels is beautifully animated with distant mountains and clear blue skies. The reels themselves seem built into a large welcoming tree.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics and soundtrack support the theme effectively and help make this game’s world an entertaining one.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Safari Sam 2 is a five reel, three row slot, with 50 win lines.</p>
<p>When 3 matching symbols appear stacked on top of each other, players are awarded a three-of-a-kind prize.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Every spin, players have a chance to be awarded the Call of the Wild feature, which covers as many as 4 of the reels in Wild symbols.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>While in the Free Spins feature, players will also have a greater chance of landing Wilds.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.3%, slightly above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility safari-themed slot.</p>
<p>This game overcomes its middling volatility with a fun theme and engaging characters.</p>
<p>Players with their eye on maximising their chances for bigger wins may wish to move on to games with higher volatility, but they’ll still be glad they gave this one a try.</p>
