<p>Dear All!</p>
<p>The casino has denied to pay all my winnings. They stole my money after an endless verification loop that was intended to keep my money away from me. I was playing simple betting, no bonuses, nothing else. If you play and win they will take your money.</p>
<p>After 29 email exchanges and already blocked online support, (Yes, they are blocked it already.) They decided to block my account and rejected to disclose the specific reason.</p>
<p>"Good Day.We are bringing to your notice that we made a decision to stop any collaboration with you (closing your gaming account) on the basis of General Terms and Conditions of the Bookmaker Company:Upon completion of the investigation, the company can make any decision that it deems to be fair and reasonable:1. to block (close) the account (including any duplicate accounts), which may entail:- all bonuses, free bets and winnings received from those bonuses and free bets when using this duplicate account becoming void and lost to you- at our sole discretion, to cancel all winnings and refund the balance of your account at the start of the investigation (minus any canceled winnings) made from your main and duplicate accounts.
