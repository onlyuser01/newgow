    <h1>Casinos In Pittsburgh Rocky Gap Casino Hotel Casino Green Bay Sunset Station Hotel And Casino New Yo</h1>

<p>Live! Philadelphia has been hit with a fine by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board for failing to protect specific areas of the property that were reserved for staff only but were invaded by patrons of the casino. During the monthly meeting of the regulator, the PGCB agreed to fine the casino $10,000 citing incidents that took place between May 2021 and February 2022, a verdict that the casino accepted.</p>
<p>PGCB Issues Fines, Gives Reasoning</p>
<p>According to the regulator, the first incident concerns an unnamed female customer who spent two hours in the prohibited areas before she was caught. The patron was accused of stealing employee belongings. In another incident of similar nature, three patrons managed to enter the property through areas that were reserved for employees.</p>
<p>The patrons were initially denied access to the facilities as they failed to show the necessary proof of vaccination to enter. The patrons were later discovered at the property, and it was established that they had entered illegally. Regardless, the PGCB has argued that it was Live! Philadelphia’s responsibility was to ensure that these incidents did not take place.</p>
<p>A Live! Philadelphia representative has confirmed that the property has taken all necessary measures to prevent such unauthorized access from happening again. The PGCB then moved on to enact enforcement action against individuals. Once again, numerous patrons were placed on a permanent ban list after they left children unattended in order to access the gambling floors across casinos in the state.</p>

<p>The PGCB puts once again the onus on the properties to take the necessary precautions to discover such offenders quickly and notify authorities quickly. Despite the additional staff and video surveillance, though, such incidents do occur. This month, the PGCG placed a man who left five children aged 3-11 unattended in the parking garage of Harrah’s Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Another person is now facing trial as he left a two-year-old unattended while they were gambling at Presque Isle Downs &amp; Casino. Both offenders were detected fairly quickly and within 30 minutes. While no children came to harm, the PGCB is looking to eradicate this from happening. Casinos have been conducting various awareness campaigns and increasing their security in the meantime.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of self-excluded gamblers in Pennsylvania has increased to 1,000 people. PGCB expects casinos in the state to ensure that anyone placed on the self-exclusion list is unable to access gambling products on-site and through any interactive wagering arm that the casinos may be partnered with.</p>
