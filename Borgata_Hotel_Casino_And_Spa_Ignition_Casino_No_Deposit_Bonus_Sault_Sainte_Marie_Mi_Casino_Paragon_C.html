<p>Joe Biden Odds Lengthen, Former Hillary Clinton Advisor Calls for Him to Exit 2020 Race</p>

<p>Former VP Joe Biden’s odds of securing the Democratic Party’s ticket for the 2020 race are lengthening, as a sexual assault accuser’s story continues to develop.</p>

<p>After Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race two weeks ago, Biden’s odds of being the Democratic Party’s nominee to take on President Donald Trump in November was seemingly a sure thing.</p>
<p>On the political betting exchange PredictIt, Biden’s shares were trading at 90 cents. Today, those shares have dropped to 81 cents. As we inch closer to the election, Biden’s odds should be shortening. Instead, they’re lengthening.</p>
<p>Tara Reade alleges that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993 when she was an aide in his Senate office. She claims the senator “had me up against a wall; he used his knee to spread open my legs, and put his fingers inside me.”</p>
<p>When she pulled away, Reade says Biden responded, “Come on man. I heard, I thought you liked me.” CNN acknowledged this week that Reade’s late mother Jeanette Altimus called into Larry King Live that same year during an episode focused on the cutthroat nature of DC politics.</p>
<p>Altimus asked on air, “I’m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington? My daughter has just left there after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.”</p>
<p>Bye Bye Biden?</p>
<p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) – not Joe Biden – has been the Democratic Party’s leading voice in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 77-year-old has taken a backseat to the coronavirus handlings, and has been confined to his house in Delaware.</p>
<p>After Biden, Cuomo has the next best odds on PredictIt of being the party’s 2020 nominee. But his shares are at just five cents. However, there’s escalating tensions among the party regarding Biden’s alleged sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>Peter Daou, a longtime Democratic strategist who has worked for Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, is calling on Biden to drop out of the race.</p>
<p>“New information has emerged supporting Tara Reade’s account of being sexually assaulted by Joe Biden,” Daou tweeted. “Credible rape accusations are disqualifying, or we have NO moral standards.”</p>
<p>Biden and DNC Link</p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced Friday a joint fundraising agreement with the presumptive party nominee. The alignment allows wealthy donors to contribute up to $360,600 to the party’s fall campaign, far higher than what each individual can directly contribute to Biden ($5,600).</p>
<p>Our goal is to ensure that we put Joe Biden in the best position possible to beat Donald Trump,” said DNC executive Mary Beth Cahill. “The DNC has built an organization that has proven it can win up and down the ballot, and that is exactly what we will do in November.”</p>
<p>PredictIt’s market asking who will win in November has Trump leading at 50 cents. Biden is next at 45 cents, and Cuomo third at four cents.</p>
