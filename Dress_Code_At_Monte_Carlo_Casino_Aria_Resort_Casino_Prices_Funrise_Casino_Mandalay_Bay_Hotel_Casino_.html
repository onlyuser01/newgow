    <h1>Dress Code At Monte Carlo Casino Aria Resort Casino Prices Funrise Casino Mandalay Bay Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>I was playing on this casino and deposited large amounts due to the great bonuses.</p>
<p>played through them lost all my money numberous times on all different games let me deposit and play whatever I wanted.my last deposit was 200 raw cash I had no bonuses left to claim</p>
<p>I won around 2000 and decided to take a 1000 withdrawal while waiting on withdrawal I turned the other 1000 into 6000 over the course of the weekend and made another withdrawal for 5000.Two days later got an email saying my first withdrawal was rejected because I played games I wasnt supposed to be playing on bonus money then said confiscated the other 6000 said I broke terms and conditions of bonuses.</p>
<p>they then sent my last 200 deposit back into my account but nothing else</p>
<p>as I started to question game logs and bonuses and told them I had played through bonuses and deposited without bonues. They emailed me saying your account is closed and banned</p>
<p>I lost near 3000 of my own deposits and 7000 in money they confiscated.</p>
<p>they had no problem with me playing anything I wanted when I lost but as soon as I won they said breach of terms and conditions confiscated my money and closed my account.</p>
<p>very strange they refunded my last deposit which Iâ€™m almost positive was raw and which I won the money with.</p>
<p>any help or response would be greatly appreciated</p>
