<p>Sunderland AFC announced today a three-year partnership with UK-based financial trading and sports betting company Spreadex ahead of the Sky Bet Championship 2022-23 Season.</p>
<p>Shirt, Stadium and Digital Brand Exposure</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Sunderland players’ shirts will feature the Spreadex Sports logo during both home and away matches until the summer of 2025. The financial trading and spread betting brand will also gain exposure via LED perimeter board advertising on the Stadium of Light and across Sunderland’s digital media platforms.</p>
<p>Commenting on the sponsorship, David MacKenzie, chief executive officer of Spreadex outlined the excitement to team with the soccer club that has just won its promotion to the Championship, looking forward to collaborating with the club, its fans and community partners.</p>
<p>After four seasons in League One, Sunderland returned to the Championship after beating Wycombe 2-0 in the Sky Bet League One play-off final at Wembley in March. The victory meant the Black Cats won their first in seven play-off campaigns.</p>
<p>“We are all delighted to welcome Spreadex as our new Principal Partner and look forward to building our relationship with them throughout the next three years,” said Steve Davison, chief operating officer at Sunderland AFC, raising the excitement expectations for the upcoming campaign in the Championship.</p>
<p>“…this partnership will also support communities within the City of Sunderland through a range of innovative initiatives,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Charity-Based Initiatives</p>
<p>As part of the commitment to work together with the club on its charity-based initiatives and community-oriented goals, Spreadex will be donating £100 ($122) to the Club’s designated charity for each goal the Black Cats score at home in the 2022-23 regular season and pledged to launch other charity initiatives in the coming months.</p>
<p>Regulated by both the UK Gambling Commission and UK’s financial sector regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, Spreadex is offering its customers access to financial trading instruments, as well as sports betting and sports spread betting products, operating out of its headquarters in St. Albans.</p>
<p>Spreadex signed a one-year sponsorship deal with Burney FC in the summer of 2021 to become the team’s official shirt sponsor and gain exposure in the English Premier League (EPL). At the end of the 2021-22 season, Burnley was relegated to the second-tier of English football after six consecutive seasons in the EPL.</p>
<p>Shirt sponsorship for gambling companies is one of the hot topics of the ongoing review of the Gambling Act 2005 as industry and public interests collide head-on while all eyes are on the government to enact radical reforms.</p>
