<p>BetMGM is one of the leading sportsbooks in the United States, offering extensive online sports betting markets as well as an in-person retail experience thanks to the physical venues operated by the MGM Resorts brand. Our BetMGM sports review will help you understand the operator better and help you see why it’s the right choice for all recreational and die-hard sports fans and bettors.</p>
<p>Created as a joint-venture between Entain and MGM Resorts International, BetMGM takes a special place in the US sports betting ecosystem. The company offers an outstanding welcome bonus, numerous promotions, and a great bonus code selection to pick from.</p>
<p>BetMGM operates both an online casino and a sportsbook, but we will focus on the sports betting product first. Find out all you need to know about the brand in one place, including what states it is available in and what the subtle differences between different jurisdictions are. All of this and more in our full BetMGM sports betting review.</p>
<p>BetMGM Online Sportsbook Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>There is a lot going and changing with BetMGM, but the welcome offer is always there to support you, right as rain. The entry-level offer is always there looking to hook you up with $500 in welcome bonus funds on your first deposit.</p>
<p>Aptly dubbed “It’s Showtime,” the bonus is available to all new customers in every specific jurisdiction. BetMGM will match your first deposit worth at least $10 all the way up to $500 and matching the deposit amount by 100%.</p>
<p>To redeem the bonus you will need to use a dedicated bonus code, usually BONUS500, although this may change depending on the state you are in, so it’s best to double-check if you have the right BetMGM bonus code.</p>
<p>The BONUS500 is a quick and easy way to secure an entry into the welcome bonus, but it’s hardly the only promotion you may pick at BetMGM. In fact, there is a whole section with “Promotions” for you to explore and benefit from.</p>
<p>The welcome bonus at BetMGM also comes with a risk-free bet, meaning that the sportsbook will pay back up to a certain amount if your first bet misses the mark, which is great news and a good way to save some money.</p>
<p>Let’s have a quick look.</p>
<p>BetMGM Promotions and Bonus Codes</p>
<p>BetMGM sports betting offer is generous precisely because it uses numerous promotions that tie into your regular sports experience without putting any additional burden on you. Instead, sports fans can pick a bonus code and redeem a bonus amount, putting it to good use on the spot.</p>
<p>The sportsbook has plenty to offer including $10 in free bets every Monday available all throughout 2021. Put another way, if you do register on a Monday, you will be eligible for a no deposit bonus, but even if you miss the Monday window, you can get your free bet next week.</p>
<p>BetMGM has a special NFL One Game Parlay Insurance, allowing you to place an ambitious bet on numerous selections and still walk unscathed should things go awry. Another great addition by BetMGM is the use of tailored promotions.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, for example, you will have special promos for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but these types of bonuses will change in the other jurisdictions BetMGM operates in presently.</p>
<p>M Life Rewards Loyalty Program</p>
<p>One way to up the experience for sports bettors is through the M life Rewards loyalty program that is developed with MGM Resorts. Designed for the retail casinos of the company, the iRewards program allows you to accumulate points that may be then exchanged for bonuses, and earning comps as well as VIP points to spend on the dedicated shop.</p>
<p>In other words, you may bet via the BetMGM mobile primarily, but when you visit an MGM Resorts property, you will be able to use these points just as well. Alternatively, you can stick to mobile sports betting and claim your bonuses remotely.</p>
<p>Where Is BetMGM Online Sports Betting Available?</p>
<p>BetMGM’s footprint is significant in the United States, and the company is expanding quickly across the entire country. While their retail venues still slightly outnumber the mobile betting opportunities, their online counterparts are established in multiple jurisdictions already.</p>
<p>Available states include New Jersey, West Virginia, Indiana, Nevada, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and most recently, Colorado and Iowa. BetMGM is already available in Michigan, with a planned launch of a betting app as soon as the Great Lakes State gives a formal go-ahead.</p>
<p>BetMGM was the first to launch a mobile sports betting app in Iowa at the beginning of 2021, as the state restriction for in-person only registration was suspended on January 1. The company clearly brings its full portfolio of online sports betting opportunities in every state it operates in, but there are some slight, state-specific differences worth mentioning.</p>
<p>BetMGM New Jersey</p>
<p>New Jersey is BetMGM’s largest market share, with the Garden State reporting record-breaking numbers in total sports betting handle placed throughout 2020. The New Jersey online sportsbook comes with all the bells and whistles. There is a fantastic variety of sports and a very good promotions section.</p>
<p>You will be able to download a dedicated iOS and Android app and have access to the full selection of markets. One small drawback is that the BetMGM NJ app doesn’t support in-game betting just yet. If you wish to visit the retail sportsbook, you should head to the Borgata Hotel Casino in Atlantic City for a fantastic in-person experience.</p>
<p>BetMGM Pennsylvania</p>
<p>BetMGM’s entry in the Keystone State came fairly late, in December 2020. Yet, it has been smooth sailing for the company in Pennsylvania ever since. The company launched an online casino, too, complementing the offer a bit further, and making for a well-rounded overall experience.</p>
<p>The apps allow you to access the entire sportsbook with all its bonuses, promotions, and other worthwhile features. There is an in-play option to enjoy at the sportsbook and you can tap into the cash out functionality that allows you to call a bet out ahead of time.</p>
<p>Odds are great and allow you to explore numerous value betting situations and optimize your bets according to the best lines available.</p>
<p>BetMGM West Virginia</p>
<p>West Virginia is another key jurisdiction where BetMGM is present. The company took a while to release an app there but finally did. West Virginia is an important part of the BetMGM portfolio and it offers a $20 risk-free bet on “First Player to Score” on the NFL. Every Monday brings you a $10 free bet as well.</p>
<p>BetMGM Indiana</p>
<p>Indiana is another interesting part of the BetMGM portfolio. While the majority of the features coincide with the core sportsbook offer, there is a special Parlay Plus Promotion running that offers you to get 40% more on your parlay bets.</p>
<p>Indiana also has interesting options for sports bettors, including the cash-out feature and the “Edit My Bet,” which allows you to have a little more say in what happens with your running selections. BetMGM Indiana definitely gets the live betting aspect of the experience just right.</p>
<p>BetMGM Nevada</p>
<p>Nevada is still a bit of an old-timer when it comes to online sports betting. The state expects people to be physically present in a licensed casino or racebook when placing a bet, which is fine. BetMGM is happy to welcome everyone to the BetMGM Sportsbook in Las Vegas and let you have fun while betting on your favorite sports.</p>
<p>This comes with the added benefit of amassing M life Rewards or iRewards for the casino, which allow you to amass further benefits from your sports betting sessions in the Silver State.</p>
<p>BetMGM Tennessee</p>
<p>BetMGM launched in Tennessee on November 1, 2020, joining a competitive field, but doing so just on time as the state has been posting solid sports handle numbers. Interest in sports betting has proven strong and BetMGM is having no trouble vying for a significant chunk of the market revenue against FanDuel, DraftKings, and most recently Action247.</p>
<p>BetMGM Colorado</p>
<p>BetMGM is legal in Colorado and you can benefit from the 100% match bonus up to $500 right away. The online sportsbook offers quite a few neat picks, including a variety of bets, and many promotions, including the event-specific odds boosters. You will stand to benefit from a great BetMGM Colorado app available for both Android and iOS users.</p>
<p>BetMGM Iowa</p>
<p>BetMGM was the first brand to launch in Iowa at the turn of 2021, with the sports betting app beating all the rest to the punch on setting shop in the Hawkeye State. Things have been running smoothly since.</p>
<p>BetMGM Michigan</p>
<p>Michigan is the latest state entry by BetMGM with the Great Lakes State issuing 15 online sports betting licenses late in December 2020 and following up in January 2021. The sportsbook’s pre-launch offer is slightly different with $100 in free bets and a $200 welcome bonus.</p>
<p>How to Register at BetMGM?</p>
<p>The signup process at BetMGM sports is straightforward and you will have no trouble completing registration within a few minutes. To do so, you need to visit the website or download the BetMGM app and you are almost ready to go. First, you need to follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Visit the BetMGM website or app, and click on “REGISTER,” usually in the top right corner next to the logo of the responsible regulator. You begin the process by providing your personal information, including your Full Name, Date of Birth, and Email. Next, you need to set yourself with a user name as well as pick your password. You also need to enter your phone number as well as Social Security Number (SSN) for the purposes of identification. The final steps of the process concern your account safety and you will enter two security questions to help you retrieve your account as well as provide the company with a mailing address. Before you proceed to finalize the process, we recommend entering a promo code in the Bonus Code field and picking the Welcome Bonus offer that is available to you in your state. You must agree to the Terms &amp; Conditions before you click on “CREATE MY ACCOUNT.” BetMGM will shortly verify your SSN and notify you that your account is available to log in with.</p>
<p>In case you run into any type of trouble, BetMGM has a dedicated customer support service that will help you figure out what the issue is. It will be a quick process registering and in the case of an emergency, solving out whatever issue has cropped up.</p>
<p>How to Bet at BetMGM?</p>
<p>Once your account has been registered, you are good to go and place your first bets at BetMGM online sportsbook. The website and app make it very easy for you to place a bet and claim your winnings as soon as a market has been settled.</p>
<p>To participate in any type of betting contest, all you need to do is navigate to the sport you wish to bet on and then choose one of the games. Actually, you may pick as many as you wish, but in general, the process of betting is a point-and-click process. As soon as you click on the odds, the Bet Slip will invite you to enter the amount you wish to stake.</p>
<p>For your convenience, BetMGM quickly calculates the amount you stand to benefit, which makes for a much quicker way of betting compared to in-person and retail options. The BetMGM bet slip allows you to quickly navigate through the history of your stakes as well as manage multiple bets at the same time.</p>
<p>BetMGM Available Sports, Odds and Markets</p>
<p>BetMGM has a bulky portfolio of sports markets, running numerous contests and categories. The user interface is designed in a way that allows you to quickly navigate through the dozens of betting categories. The sportsbook has featured numerous mainstream sports, including:</p>
<p>NFL</p>
<p>NBA</p>
<p>NCAA</p>
<p>NHL</p>
<p>MLB</p>
<p>MLS</p>
<p>There are over 20 main categories and if you wish to stick with the most bet on markets, you can just go to Top Sports.</p>
<p>Golf, tennis, martial arts, and motorsports are all here and part of the selection. There are numerous selections to and available markets with all major league upcoming games listed on time for sports fans to make a call on what they want to bet on next.</p>
<p>Apart from a decent variety of categories, BetMGM makes that everything under the hood is well-oiled and working properly. The odds are often quite worthwhile and they offer an edge to the recreational and more serious bettors.</p>
<p>You will be able to quickly shop around other sportsbooks in your state and arrive at the same conclusion we have. BetMGM offers some of the most competitive lines and fixtures. In terms of pure bet type variety, there is a decent enough option to go along with. Sports fans get to bet on:</p>
<p>Moneyline</p>
<p>Point spreads</p>
<p>Totals</p>
<p>Proposition</p>
<p>Parlays, teasers, futures, and live betting are all parts of BetMGM’s worthwhile sports betting offer. BetMGM has multiple partnerships with sports franchises offering some neat wagering opportunities that are not readily available at other sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The live market is quite well-rounded, with games featured front and center at BetMGM, allowing for some excitement to your betting session whenever you need it. Apart from basketball, football, and hockey making up the bulk of the live markets, you can enjoy tons of tennis table.</p>
<p>Cash out Your Live Bets</p>
<p>You will have no trouble editing your bets and assuming full control over the way you run your live bets. BetMGM will allow you to benefit from the “Cash Out” feature that simply allows you to withdraw a bet you fear might be put on the wrong outcome.</p>
<p>Then again, you can edit the bet conditions and allow for some of the bet to continue running while withdrawing half of the sum. Live betting is an advanced form of wagering, but it certainly offers quite a bit of leeway when it comes to sports betting.</p>
<p>BetMGM Mobile App</p>
<p>Clearly, BetMGM’s mobile apps are its greatest strength. While the desktop website remains committed to providing you with a top-notch sports betting experience online, the majority of customers turn to mobile sportsbooks repeatedly.</p>
<p>The BetMGM betting app is a state-of-the-art affair available to both Android and iOS software and devices. You will have no trouble downloading the app to begin with, as the company only operates in states where sports betting is legal.</p>
<p>This means you can download the app in each state directly from the Google Play or Apple Store. Alternatively, for the Android app, you usually have a link on the website, making for an even easier download experience.</p>
<p>The BetMGM apps are well-equipped with everything you need for a worthwhile experience. The availability of cash out feature may vary from one state to the next, but the company has mostly incorporated it in its main betting markets.</p>
<p>One minor thing to notice about installing the Android app directly from the website is that you will need to “Allow installations from unknown sources” to be able to launch the app. The user interface is easy to navigate and will be no trouble for you to figure out as well, regardless of your screen size.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s mobile apps are on par with industry standards and go a step ahead of the competition providing you with an intuitive low-broadband sports betting solution you can carry in your pocket. The only hiccup is that you must be physically present in the state you are registered to bet in and will need a separate account for other states.</p>
<p>BetMGM Online Sportsbook Cashier</p>
<p>To make betting a straightforward process for you, it’s important to make sure that the payment options are up to snuff. This is yet another area of expertise in which BetMGM is happy to oblige, providing customers with a state-of-the-art cashier section.</p>
<p>Because BetMGM operates exclusively in licensed markets, you will always have a quick way to deposit and withdraw, knowing that your money is safe around the clock and there are no specific issues for you to worry about. The available banking methods include:</p>
<p>Bank transfer</p>
<p>Credit cards</p>
<p>PayPal</p>
<p>E-check</p>
<p>BetMGM + Prepaid Card</p>
<p>Pay at Cashier</p>
<p>There is a combination of remote and in-person payment options, which make your betting experience even nicer. You can use the dedicated BetMGM+ Prepaid Card to provide your account with a bit of extra security, albeit in our experience, BetMGM upholds all industry standards for protecting your information.</p>
<p>BetMGM Customer Support</p>
<p>Customer support is right where it should be when it comes to BetMGM. The company has put emphasis on keeping sports fans happy and it has clearly succeeded by establishing clear and reliable channels of communication. Each state has its own dedicated customer support too, but in general, you can talk to a care agent via:</p>
<p>Phone</p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Live chat</p>
<p>Visit a casino</p>
<p>Customer service is available 24/7 making BetMGM one of the most trusted and reliable brands. The company has a quick way of sorting any issue that comes your way and sports fans can be absolutely certain that the company is doing well.</p>
<p>It employs over 300 people in New Jersey alone, and what may appear like an excessive workforce is in fact a representation of BetMGM’s desire to always stay on top of the customer experience. Creating tailored promotions and having the manpower to solve any issue that comes with it is definitely a strong upside.</p>
<p>On top of everything else, there is always a dedicated FAQ section to help you browse through certain issues yourself and look for a solution. The self-help part of the website is always very well-organized and allows you to rule a few things out by yourself.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether you use the desktop website or your app. You can get hold of customer support right away.</p>
<p>Final Word</p>
<p>BetMGM is a dedicated sports betting service that comes with a whole lot of excellent sports markets, payment options, and numerous promotions that are in constant flux and offer a personalized experience across state borders.</p>
<p>The live section is powerful enough and covers quite a few markets, including tennis table which is considered a bit of an exotic pick right there, adding up nicely to the overall offer of the brand.</p>
<p>Besides, there is a dedicated 24/7 customer support team along with fully-fledged mobile apps that enable Android and iOS device owners and sports fans to always be able to place a quick bet even when on the go.</p>
<p>We rate BetMGM highly and believe that recreational and more competitive sports bettors will find their services right on point.</p>
