    <h1>Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Casino Tribal Casinos Cherokee Hotel Casino West Siloam Springs Casinos I</h1>

<p>Here is something that I wanted to say. All online casinos that are licensed by serious regulatory authorities/bodies, such as MGA or UKGC, are obliged to follow some rules or directives. One of them is not to accept players from selected regions and also not to allow players (especially when a player is country-restricted) to mask their i.p address so they can access the website or play restricted slots by software providers or use deposit methods that have blocked all transactions through the gateway system, in order to keep things transparent and to secure a safe gaming environment. (MGA has published many directives and I highly believe that all serious online casinos licensed by the MGA are very strict when it comes to country restrictions and VPN use)</p>
<p>This is why, I think as a non expert on this matter, not even one MGA-licensed casino allows players to mask their i.p. address, gain access to the casino, use deposit options that wouldn't be available in the first place, play slot games by providers that are not allowed in the first place, but you will find plenty of online casinos which are unlicensed or licensed by Curacao.</p>
<p>As you can see from the evidence I had forwarded to you, the casino in question, offered an alternative link to have access to the website stating that it was created for players in different regions that may experience problems logging into their account. Not once I was told that I was country-restricted. When I specifically asked them, I was told that I wasn't.</p>
<p>Moreover, I could not make any deposit through the alternative website, because the deposit methods I had back then, did not let me process any payment to Betsafe, because apparently I was not allowed to make any deposits to that particular casino. But, I was allowed to mask my i.p. address so to bypass a restriction by the department of Betsafe back then, in order to continue making deposits, even though it was clearly stated (saw it years later) that it was forbidden to do such thing, because apparently it is a term that must be applicable in all cases (especially in this one), it is probably a measure to keep things transparent, fair and safe according to the MGA.</p>
<p>Betsafe had to:</p>
<p>Inform me that I was not allowed to have a gaming account on its platform after a while. Forbid me from continuing playing through an alternative website. Forbid me from masking my i.p. address so to continue making deposits while all deposit methods were not allowing it through their gateway system due to country-restriction. (something that Betsafe knew and also I told them about having the trouble making any kind of deposit) Forbid me from playing with VPN, online slot games by software providers that were not available for me in the first place. Keep the clause (VPN not allowed) applicable to me as I believe it is for everyone.</p>
<p>If Betsafe had done at least one of the abovementioned tasks, I would have either had my account closed or inactive due to the inability of depositing.</p>
<p>The right way is to have the refund credited in my account if Betsafe is indeed fair and safe.</p>
