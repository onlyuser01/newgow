<p>AW22 clearly focuses on making it possible for customers to place bets quickly and reliably while on the go. Using an Apple Watch as the medium is a brand-new opportunity for consumers to enjoy swift and intuitive sports betting. The app was backed by the head of gaming corporate finance, citizens Chris Lynch who added that SB22’s dedicated iOS platform is definitely the best in the industry.</p>
<p>Lynch also added that the opportunity to bring sports wagering to the Apple Watch and combine it with other technological advancements, such as VR functionality, is set to completely transform the way people experience sports betting in the first place.</p>
<p>AW22 Is Integrated Directly with SB22’s iOS App</p>
<p>As to AW22, the solution is quick and intuitive and makes it easy to navigate sports betting markets and place a wager. The solution is paired with the already existing iOS SB22 smartphone app and ensures a high level of security. SB22 CCO Vik Shrestha also added that the solution was based on a modular platform which allowed it to place the user experience front and center.</p>
<p>“AW22 offers a completely new way to place bets and allows our operator clients the ability to provide an innovative product ecosystem that is highly differentiated,” Shrestha concluded.</p>
