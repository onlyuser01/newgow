<p>MaximBet, a sports betting operator aiming to offer the ultimate sports betting experience, has inked a partnership deal with sports data and technology company Genius Sports. The agreement will see the B2B provider supply the provider with its sports solutions.</p>
<p>MaximBet to Enhance Offerings with Genius Sports Solutions</p>
<p>As per the agreement, MaximBet will receive access to Genius Sports’ proprietary NFL solutions, real-time data and analytics. This will help the operator reinforce its offerings ahead of the NFL season, which kicks in tomorrow, September 9.</p>
<p>MaximBet also plans to strengthen its offer with pre-match, live data, live trading and next-gen statistics from Genius Sports. The operator currently uses data present in 97% of the overall US betting market.</p>
<p>While the bookmaker hopes to capitalize on the upcoming football season, it will use the deal with Genius Sports to reinforce its other offerings, which include basketball, soccer and NASCAR products. As the official data partner of the MAC, Genius Sports will also provide MaximBet with data feeds for NCAA sports.</p>
<p>The Operator Believes Genius Sports Is a Perfect Partner</p>
<p>Daniel Graetzer, founder and chief executive of MaximBet commented on the agreement. He said that one cannot offer a premium betting experience without providing the best and freshest exclusive content. The partnership with Genius Sports will, therefore, help the company provide its users with such content, helping MaximBet engage sports fans with superior betting products. Graetzer said that Genius Sports is the perfect partner for MaximBet as the company continues to grow across the NA region.</p>
<p>We are the only true lifestyle sportsbook, offering players incredible, money-can’t buy access to MAXIM parties, courtside seats and more. Combining that with the real-time data our players need gives them a full offering not found elsewhere in the marketplace. Daniel Graetzer, CEO, MaximBet</p>
<p>Sean Conroy, executive vice president of Genius Sports North America, also shared his thoughts on the matter. He said that his team is looking forward to helping MaximBet grow its following and acquire new customers.</p>
<p>Across official data, trading and highly targeted marketing, Genius Sports will play a central role in powering MaximBet’s exciting growth across the US. We’re excited to help engage and expand MaximBet’s passionate customer base. Sean Conroy, EVP Genius Sports NA</p>
<p>Genius Sports recently teamed up with the Canadian Football League and helped it introduce a new free-to-play predictor game for its customers. CFL Blitz Picks was launched as a part of the pre-existing relationship between the provider and the league.</p>
<p>Genius Sports recently posted its Q2 results, which demonstrated that the company continues to grow.</p>
