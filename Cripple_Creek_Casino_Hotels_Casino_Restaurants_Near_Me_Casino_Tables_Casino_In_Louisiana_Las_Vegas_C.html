    <h1>Cripple Creek Casino Hotels Casino Restaurants Near Me Casino Tables Casino In Louisiana Las Vegas C</h1>

<p>Hello Marquez199,</p>
<p>We contacted the Casinochan, because we wanted to know if you asked for self-exclusion, or expressed gambling addiction in any other way. However, in your email you are only mentioning you never win and there is not a hint of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Sadly, we cannot help you under these circumstances. You need to let the casino know in case you have a problem like this, otherwise the support could think you just want to close the account, because you don't like the casino. This could result in offering bonuses, to motivate you to stay and play. In this case it really wasn't meant to support your gambling addition.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your deposits can't be returned, as the casino wasn't aware of your problem when you asked the support to close your account. We cannot punish the casino either. I can only recommend you to use blocking softwares, which will prevent you from using gambling websites. You can read more about it in this article:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/responsible-gambling#apps-and-tools</p>
<p>Other available softweres are for example:</p>
<p>www.gamblock.com</p>
<p>www.betfilter.com</p>
<p>You can also try to ask your bank to set the limit for transactions. Again, I am really sorry, but we cannot continue resolving this case.</p>
<p>Please, check out the article I am mentioning in this message, you may find many useful information there.</p>
<p>Take care and I hope this will help at least a little bit with your problem.</p>
