<p>Players who are fascinated by the world of organized crime and its rigorous and unwritten rules that everyone knows but no one talks about are likely to enjoy exploring the slot by the studio known for its quality releases over the years.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about the game’s theme, graphics, storyline, characters, symbols, and the payout for them, along with the special features and bonuses available, keep reading, our pros have compiled a comprehensive Magia Family online slot review that is informative and easy to browse. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Don’t Turn Your Back on the Family</p>
<p>As mentioned in the intro, the slot is focused on the Italian mobsters part of the Mafia in the early 20s. This particular information is immediately noticeable as soon as the game is loaded and players get to observe the frightening-looking mobster holding a machine gun to the left of the grid. Right off the bat, players are introduced to the dangerous world of the Italian mafia with risks lurking every step of the way.</p>
<p>As long as everyone does the right thing in mobsters’ books and keeps their mouths shut, however, their pockets will continue to be filled with hard cash all day, every day. Sounds like a plan, at least in theory for the sake of the storyline in the game. This is what the storyline of the game is all about. The big Mafioso, who is the main protagonist in the game, will lead the way to big wins as long as players don’t suddenly turn their back on the family. The mafia rules are straightforward. One must never betray any of the secrets of la Cosa Nostra, mess with the family of other members, or become involved with narcotics.</p>
<p>Ranging from suitcases stacked with cash, paying cards and chips, cases packed with bottled alcoholic drinks, the Mafia Boss himself, grenades, Molotov cocktails, machine guns, and mystery bags holding different weapons, the graphic elements are all doing an excellent job at crayoning the world of organized crime depicted by the skilled pros at Dragon Gaming. The background adds further mystery to the overall scenery while making the theme complete.</p>
<p>The slot looks absolutely brilliant graphics-wise thanks to the realistic 3D graphics which add to the overall experience.</p>
<p>If you are ready to join the Big Boss and let him guide your steps toward some crazy big wins, keep reading to learn how.</p>
<p>Mafia Family: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game’s standard or basic symbols range from playing cards and casino chips to cases stashed with booze, bags full of money, and different members of the mafia, including some attractive ladies wearing sexy dresses. The game also hosts three different wild symbols along with a scatter symbol. Any of them can pop up on the 75 pay lines paying left to right in this only high volatility game with an expected payout of 94%.</p>
<p>The payouts are clearly marked in the Paytable section in the main menu that can be accessed from the hamburger menu in the top right corner. They range from 6x to 4x for matching between three and five identical Big Boss symbols, to 5x to 32x payouts for landing three to five identical attractive girl symbols, and so on, all the way down to 1x to 6x payouts for the play cards of the lowest value.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The cheerful, upbeat soundtrack is a remarkable one thanks to Mark Ronson’s contribution. The modern percussion mixes nicely with the vintage-sounding horns for more immersive gameplay.</p>
<p>The animations represented by the mobster seen shooting his gun every time the reels stop spinning and wilds start popping on the grid or the flickering street lamp come to beautifully close the circle of a well-designed, quality video slot.</p>
<p>Mafia Family Gameplay</p>
<p>After selecting the amount of their first bet by clicking the arrows next to the Coin Value or selecting the Max Bet alternative, players can proceed to spin the reels and look at their total wins in the WIN section of the screen that will show up at the end of each new spin.</p>
<p>The game only pays the highest win in a combination. All symbol line wins are multiplied by the amount of the total bet.</p>
<p>Players can also control the ambiance sounds and sound effects, use the Quickspin alternative for a faster-paced experience, or use the AutoSpin option at their discretion.</p>
<p>Mafia Family: Free Games, Expanding Wilds, Random Wilds, Random 3×3 Wilds &amp; Buy Feature</p>
<p>Free Game Feature</p>
<p>To engage in the Free Spin feature, players need to land a minimum of three scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. When activated, the feature rewards players with 10, 12, or 15 free spins. Before the feature is initiated, players are introduced to three mystery bags they need to choose from. The bags can be filled with weapons (one out of the three random wild symbols) that will be further used in each of the following spins. The three available random wilds are:</p>
<p>Molotov – Random Expanding Wilds – when one, two, or three expanding reels pop on the reels</p>
<p>Machine Gun – Random Wilds – the random symbol noticed on the grid turns into two up to 12 wilds simultaneously</p>
<p>Grenade – Random 3×3 Wilds – the 3×3 symbols can pop up anywhere on the grid</p>
<p>Buy Feature</p>
<p>Players who do not have the patience to wait around for the special features to pop up can easily purchase their preferred weapons (wilds with free spins) for a 25x total bet up to 105x the total bet.</p>

<p>With a gorgeous design and soundtrack, smooth gameplay, and excellent random wilds and free spins popping up for big wins, Mafia Family is a top recommendation for fans of the genre.</p>
