<p>Payment processing company PayNearMe is now officially licensed to operate in Arizona and has launched with Barstool Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Launching in Arizona as New States Await</p>
<p>PayNearMe has been granted an official license to operate in Arizona. The payment platform provider, which focuses on assisting iGaming companies in regulated gaming markets to conduct payments, received an official go-ahead from the Arizona Department of Gaming to launch operations, offering a number of payment types to every licensed operator in the state.</p>
<p>Barstool Sportsbook, an established partner of PayNearMe in the US regulated gambling market, is among the first to go live with the solution in Arizona. The payment provider is looking to expand its consumer base and sign more partnerships with gaming operators and facilitate payments for their players.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, PayNearMe CRO and general manager Michael Kaplan said: “Players want a frictionless deposit experience, and PayNearMe’s iGaming solution helps operators improve the iGaming experience by enabling players to quickly and easily fund their accounts using any tender they choose — including Apple Pay and Google Pay — via a smartphone.”</p>
<p>Kaplan is confident that PayNearMe’s technology comes at an important time when more states are legalizing online sports betting, with consumers looking for intuitive payment options first. The executive is sure that PayNearMe can set up shop at each newly-regulated gaming state as it comes online and meets operators’ and consumers’ expectations.</p>
<p>Innovating Payment to Boost Engagement</p>
<p>Penn Interactive director of operations Jake Francis welcomed the partnership and said that it was an important step forward for Barstool Sportsbook &amp; Casino. “PayNearMe’s technology makes it possible for us to quickly begin accepting cash deposits as states go live,” Francis explained.</p>
<p>PayNearMe’s staff is confident that the company’s expertise allows it to stay up-to-date with the needs of the gaming industry and provide it with the solution that its stakeholders seek. The payment company is now live in 14 US states, and it’s quickly growing its footprint across the entire country. There are some 30 states where gambling is legalized in some form, with sports and casinos leading the way.</p>
<p>PayNearMe’s solutions, the company argues, allow partners to optimize their revenue while reducing costs and improving the overall experience for customers. The company is confident that payment innovation can lead to better engagement and stronger adoption of gambling products.</p>
