    <h1>How Much Do Casino Dealers Make Joliet Casino Hollywood Don Laughlin S Riverside Resort Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>I asked the agent what is the current RTP on the slot where I played these free spins from deposit, he decided to ask me a question -&gt; What is RTP? I didn't hesitate for a second and answered the question with a question. You're the one who works at an online casino and you don't know? The people working there are incredibly trained. No comment.</p>
<p>I also managed to double my deposit even with a slight surplus, after which I lost all my funds and decided to close my account with this casino. It doesn't look good and my intuition tells me it was a wise decision. I wish the players good luck, but I'm afraid they won't be happy with the game. :) Also, I read somewhere that this is a twin casino of Wcasino, which allegedly offered fake games in the past (deliberately lowered RTP for gameplay).</p>
<p>I don't think any casino would agree to this crazy idea... For obvious reasons ^^ This would mean the end of an era of online casinos. In addition, I noticed that in some casinos it is difficult to access the full history of the game.</p>
<p>Rocketplay Casino has still not sent me my entire gaming history despite its declaration. (Account closed by them).</p>
<p>Now they explain that they have no such obligation, that I have already been deleted from their database (email address).</p>
<p>They basically I deposited one more time my entire withdrawal from winnings with a slight excess before saying -&gt; goodbye. :)</p>
<p>In fact, that's how I felt it was going to go.</p>
