<p>Wynn Las Vegas has revealed a new program that is intended at boosting customer and guests’ health and wellness experiences on-site the property</p>
<p>This new commitment is captured by the company’s signature Wynn Living Well program which has been carefully tailored to meet current customer needs and improve on their overall experience.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts Is All About the Healthy Lifestyle</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts COO for North America, Brian Gullbrants, said that the property and the company were striving to offer guests a new experience that allows them to stay healthy, remain fit, and generally not sacrifice their wellness because they are away from home.</p>
<p>Wynn’s program was developed to provide guests with everything they would need to live well, he assured, and no matter how guests defined wellness themselves. Wynn is also seeking to raise awareness for its product by bringing Amanda Kloots, a known health, and wellness personality, who will serve as the program’s ambassador.</p>
<p>There are dedicated full-body workout videos available at Wynn and Encore Las Vegas part of the new initiative and program. Kloots welcomed the opportunity to create these materials and generally promote wellness as part of the Wynn Resorts experience. She said:</p>
<p>My number one goal, whether traveling or at home, is to make fitness part of my daily routine and incorporate movement into my everyday. Wynn Living Well ambassador Amanda Kloots</p>
<p>It’s what she wants for Wynn guests as well and what can be achieved through the new Wynn Living Well program, Kloots assured. This program is something that Kloots and Wynn have described as a “holistic approach to wellness.”</p>
<p>Wynn Living Well is centered around three main pillars of the experience, which include “renew,” “replenish” and “re-energize.” Under the program, Wynn has made sure to feature numerous exercising and nutritional options to cater to every taste, preference, and need.</p>
<p>Through the program, though, these will become available in a balanced way that is intended to maximize guest satisfaction and the impact of wellness choices.</p>
<p>Making Wellness a Core Value for the Company</p>
<p>Wynn Living Well offerings will be available to both visitors and guests of the resort, making for a comprehensive product that the company hopes to become a part of its identity and a defining feature of its character moving forward.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Wynn brand has continued to demonstrate its commitment to employees. In the wake of one of the worst downturns in the gaming industry, the company’s China-facing subsidiary, Wynn Macau, issued a special one-time allowance covering 98% of the company’s workforce, with some 11,600 employees receiving the equivalent of a full-month salary.</p>
