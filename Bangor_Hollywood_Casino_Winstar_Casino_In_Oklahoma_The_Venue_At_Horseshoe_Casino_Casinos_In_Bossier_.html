    <h1>Bangor Hollywood Casino Winstar Casino In Oklahoma The Venue At Horseshoe Casino Casinos In Bossier</h1>

<p>Subject: Official Complaint Against Westcasino.com</p>
<p>Dear Casino Guru Team,</p>
<p>I am reaching out to you today to lodge an official complaint against the online casino Westcasino.com. Over the past few days I have lost a considerable amount of money on this platform, and I am deeply concerned about the circumstances leading to these losses.</p>
<p>Since January 23rd, 2024, I have deposited a total of 906 Euros at Westcasino.com. Despite my numerous attempts, it has not been possible for me to withdraw any winnings at any time. The last 6 deposits all went the same way, regardless of the chosen game or provider. My bets usually amounted to a maximum of 1 Euro, often even less.</p>
<p>Particularly alarming is the fact that Westcasino.com does not provide access to the game history or the possibility to download it. This limitation makes it exceedingly difficult for me to review and verify my bets and outcomes.</p>
<p>The casino claims that my losses are due to a streak of bad luck. However, I firmly believe that this is not down to bad luck, but rather due to the speed at which my money is disappearing and the lack of transparency in relation to the game history and odds of winning.</p>
<p>Another point of concern that I would like to draw attention to is the fact that Westcasino.com doesn't hold a German gambling license. This means that they are not authorized to offer gambling services in Germany.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I have repeatedly experienced technical issues on the Westcasino.com website, including game crashes, freezes, and misdirection to other games. There have also been instances where if I had enough scatters for free spins, the last decisive scatter suddenly jumped ahead although it had actually stopped.</p>
<p>This combination of technical difficulties and apparent game manipulation further heightens my concerns as to the fairness and integrity of the games on this platform.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to point out that I exclusively selected games on Westcasino.com with a high Return to Player (RTP) of over 90%, often even between 96 and 99%. Despite these seemingly favorable conditions, I was unable to make any meaningful gains.</p>
<p>I also have serious concerns about the verification process on Westcasino.com. At present, the casino requests customers send their personal documents via email for verification. This method appears extremely unprofessional and raises concerns regarding privacy. In contrast, other providers use established online platforms to carry out verification in a professional and secure manner. Despite repeat attempts at contact and even though I have sent all the documents requested by Westcasino.com, my account hasn't been verified until now.</p>
<p>This situation heightens my worries about the trustworthiness and reliability of Westcasino.com and underscores the need for a thorough investigation into this matter.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration this situation and the fact that Westcasino.com doesn't have a German license, I urgently ask for your support in investigating this matter and assistance in procuring a refund of the money I have lost. I have serious concerns as to the fairness and transparency of the games on this platform and I expect an appropriate resolution to my situation.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your attention and support.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Kevin Strunk</p>
