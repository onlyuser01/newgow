    <h1>Strip Vegas Map Casinos New Casinos Online Iowa Casinos Matrix Casino San Jose High Roller Casino Pl</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I wanted to withdraw my winnings. First, my account had to be verified (deposits followed with Apple Pay). After I had submitted the required documents, an email came again saying "documents are still missing". After chatting with customer support, I re-submitted the required paperwork. Then another email came, documents were missing, I contacted the chat again, who then informed me that he had to have verified all deposits from 2021, so I sent bank statements from the months in which it is clear what I deposited, my name and address, etc .</p>
<p>Now I have seen in my account that the documents were rejected again and a short time later my account was blocked until 02/18/22.</p>
<p>Please help, because the support just can't help me anymore.</p>
