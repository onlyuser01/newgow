<p>Hibs enjoyed its initial term with QuinnBet and praised the operator for its outstanding safer gambling efforts</p>
<p>A month after teaming up with The Curragh, gambling operator QuinnBet has secured an extension to its commercial partnership with Hibernian FC, a Scotland-based soccer team. As a result, the club will continue to promote the gaming company.</p>
<p>QuinnBet and Hibs first joined forces in 2022, with the former party’s brand being extensively promoted across the team’s Easter Road stadium. Following a successful 18-month term, the partnership has now been extended by an additional two years.</p>
<p>Under the renewed agreement the operator’s logo will continue to feature across Hibs’ First Team’s 2023/24 and 24/25 travel-wear range. The kits will be worn by the players during international travel, home and away fixtures.</p>
<p>QuinnBet is a fairly young but ambitious online gambling and sports betting company that was founded in 2017. The operator has quickly cemented itself as a notable operator thanks to its customer-centric philosophy, amazing customer care, great promotions and dedication to safer gambling.</p>
<p>QuinnBet enjoys a lot of attention across Britain and Ireland. One of its best qualities is its Live Chat customer support where customers’ queries get resolved within a few minutes. In addition, the operator boasts GamCare’s Safer Gambling Standard, attesting to its commitment to sustainability.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Are Thrilled to Extend Their Relationship</p>
<p>Murray Milligen, Hibernian FC’s head of commercial, said that his team has had a blast working with QuinnBet over the past 18 months. He added that he is thrilled that the two parties’ agreement has been extended for two more years.</p>
<p>Milligen praised the gambling company for its exceptional commitment to responsible gambling and its efforts to raise awareness of the matter.</p>
<p>Their commitment to raising awareness of responsible gambling is hugely important, and we look forward to working closely with them to develop strategies to continue that. Murray Milligen, head of commercial, Hibernian FC</p>
<p>Niall McPartland, QuinnBet’s marketing manager, also shared his thoughts on the deal extension with Hibs. He confirmed Milligen’s words, saying that the two parties have really enjoyed their partnership so far.</p>
<p>We enjoy a fantastic relationship with the club, and it is an honor for us to continue our sponsorship as the 150th anniversary of the club approaches. We take our social responsibilities extremely seriously and we would like to thank the Commercial Team at Hibs for all their support in ensuring that our partnership with the club has the promotion of Responsible Gambling to the fore. Niall McPartland, marketing manager, QuinnBet</p>
<p>McPartland wished Hibs the very best of luck in the upcoming soccer season.</p>
<p>In January, QuinnBet signed a partnership agreement with Punchestown, ahead of the Grand National Trial.</p>
