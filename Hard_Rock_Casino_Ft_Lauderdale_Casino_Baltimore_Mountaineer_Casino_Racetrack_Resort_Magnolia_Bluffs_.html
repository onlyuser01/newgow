    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Ft Lauderdale Casino Baltimore Mountaineer Casino Racetrack Resort Magnolia Bluffs</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>my name is leo I have an account at Vulkan Vegas and in April I wanted to ban myself forever. I suffer from severe gambling addiction. Psychologists have already established this. Also, I'm in ongoing therapy and had only managed to be off play for a few months.</p>
<p>I was able to successfully exclude myself from gambling with all operators where I was registered. But not at Vulkan Vegas. On the website, the provider says I can block my account in the "Responsible Gaming" section. But this area does not exist. So I contacted an employee via live chat. I informed that I want to permanently ban my account forever. But the clerk told me I had to do a full verification of my account first, which I hadn't done yet. Since I deposited there with many different cards and accounts, this was a cumbersome process. I just wanted to block my account forever.</p>
<p>Anyway, Vulkan Vegas didn't ban me. They sent me an email saying exactly that. "In order for us to ban your account, you must first verify your account and then send us an email and tell us the reason for the ban."</p>
<p>I immediately contacted a member of staff again via live chat. I was really frustrated because I couldn't lock (and protect) myself. I said annoyed that they couldn't even get my account banned. In any case, the account is still open to this day. Luckily I have kept the screenshots of the chat and the e-mail about the ban until today.</p>
<p>I haven't played for a few months. Then I received an email from Vulkan where they offered me a no deposit bonus of around â‚¬200. I just pushed that email away. But a few days later - in a weak moment - I accepted the offer. A few days later - because the crediting took so long - I really just gambled away the free credit.</p>
<p>But a few days later, my suffering began again. I deposited and lost a huge sum in a few days. I'm totally frustrated with myself for relapsing again but also with Vulkan as it only happened because of this ad as they were fighting the self-lockdown at the time. They simply tried to prevent this by providing the supposedly necessary account verification.</p>
<p>I've gambled away all the money I have. Completely succumbed again to my pathological addiction. Now I'm totally at a loss as to what to do. Of course, the first thing I do tomorrow is to contact my therapy center.</p>
<p>But since it was a huge sum of money, I wonder if I shouldn't make a complaint here?</p>
<p>What do you advise me?</p>
