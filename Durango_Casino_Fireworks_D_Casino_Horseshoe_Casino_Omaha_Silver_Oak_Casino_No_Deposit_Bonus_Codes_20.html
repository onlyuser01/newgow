<p>BetRivers’ sports betting, and soon iGaming product, is going live in Michigan at noon today as the company strikes a new partnership with the Detroit Pistons.</p>
<p>BetRivers Teams up with Detroit Pistons</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive’s leading sports betting brand, BetRivers.com, has signed a new awareness partnership with the Detroit Pistons. The NBA franchise and the betting firm are coming together to mark the beginning of online sports betting in the state of Michigan, which is going live today at noon.</p>
<p>Pistons fan can start playing games and participate in various contests as soon as the offer is live and through the dedicated Pistons app, as well as BetRivers’ own offer. Sports fans will be able to also start betting on the Pistons and specifically on the upcoming game versus the 76ers on Saturday.</p>
<p>All Michigan residents over the age of 21 can sign up for mobile betting and use a handheld or desktop device to participate in sports betting contests. Even better, the legislation predicts the launch of an iGaming experience with numerous Las Vegas casino-style games available.</p>
<p>A Partnership to Empower Consumers</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the partnership between BetRivers.com and the Pistons will grant consumers access to numerous tailored experiences and special prizes. Rush Street Interactive is also gaining access to the intellectual property of the NBA team, including logos and marks, and will be allowed to promote the BetRivers sportsbook in association with the Pistons on various media channels, including social, digital and radio advertising.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership with the Detroit Pistons, RSI Richard Schwartz had this to outline what he considers a fruitful partnership: “Michiganders love their NBA team and the Detroit Pistons have a rich history, winning the NBA Championship three times. This partnership combines two organizations that share an unwavering commitment to providing sports fans with unparalleled experiences.”</p>
<p>RSI Growth in the US Is Significant</p>
<p>Schwartz further commented on the successful expansion of the company throughout the United States, with Michigan becoming the latest jurisdiction to welcome the tailored betting product. RSI has been running in the country since 2016 and managed to significantly expand its footprint.</p>
<p>RSI and BetRivers have focused on player-friendly features and experiences that allow the brand to remain competitive and strike home with players. Rush Street also won the Casino Operator of the Year and Customer Service Operator of the Year in 2020, consolidating its status as a trusted brand.</p>
<p>Speaking further on the imminent Michigan launch, Schwartz said that he was confident that customers will appreciate the well-developed and comprehensive selection of sports and iGaming products available to them.</p>
<p>The company is teaming up with the Little River Casino Resort, its local land-based partner which is one of the prerequisites for joining the state in the first place. Recently, BetRivers signed NFL legends Jerome Bettis as part of its celebrity brand ambassador lineup.</p>
