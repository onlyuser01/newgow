<p>Dear roku,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly, and I am afraid you will have to go through this process if you want to get your winnings. I would suggest contacting the casino and finding out what documents exactly are required and providing them in the best possible quality and as soon as possible. If all the data is correct, there should be no reason for the casino to delay your withdrawal.</p>
<p>I have checked the general terms and conditions and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"After the registration process the User shall provide JustBit with valid identification information under Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. The User shall do</p>
<p>before first withdrawal of funds irrespective of the amount;</p>
<p>in case of a deposit for the sum equal to or exceeding 2000 euros or its equivalent;</p>
<p>in case of depositing in the amount of 7 500 euros (or its equivalent) or more (by several installments) by the same User during a month.</p>
<p>KYC procedure is performed under the rules of KYC/AML Policy.</p>
<p>JustBit reserves the right to carry out valid identification of a User under Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures in cases not covered by p.13 hereof if there’s strong grounds to believe that there’s risk of commitment of fraud, money-laundering or any abuse on the part of the User or in case of frequent and major withdrawals by one User during a reasonably short period of time."</p>
<p>Please let us know if this advice was helpful or if we need to intervene. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
