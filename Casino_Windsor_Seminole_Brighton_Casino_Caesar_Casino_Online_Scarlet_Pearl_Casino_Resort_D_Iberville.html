    <h1>Casino Windsor Seminole Brighton Casino Caesar Casino Online Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort D Iberville</h1>

<p>I am troubled because I can not withdraw due to the unreasonable withdrawal conditions presented like later.</p>
<hr />
<p>background:</p>
<p>6/26</p>
<p>・ I registered with JETCASINO and received free spins.</p>
<p>(I think the amount of money I got was about $ 10)</p>
<p>・ After that, I was fortunate to increase it to about $ 100, and in the meantime, I cleared the betting conditions and converted it to real money that I could go to work.</p>
<p>・ I tried to withdraw money, but it was canceled and I received an email with the following words.</p>
<p>"Your cashout has been canceled. For a successful withdrawal you need to upload a photo of your ID and a selfie with it. You also need to make a deposit of the balance amount and complete its triple wagering."</p>
<p>Here, I realized that "you need to deposit the same amount as the bonus amount you got (the prize amount of free spins) and triple the bet".</p>
<p>6/27</p>
<p>・ I deposited $ 20 from virtual currency and achieved a triple bet.</p>
<p>(The betting conditions for the deposit bonus received by deposit have also been achieved)</p>
<p>・ Fortunately, I succeeded in increasing the winning amount to $ 5,000.</p>
<p>・ I uploaded "ID card" and "ID card + selfie photo".</p>
<p>6/28</p>
<p>・ The uploaded identity verification document was approved, and I applied for a $ 4,000 withdrawal to the virtual currency wallet.</p>
<p>・ Withdrawal has been cancelled</p>
<p>・ When I contacted support, I received the following answers.</p>
<p>・ ・ "The balance you are about to withdraw is treated as a bonus"</p>
<p>・ ・ "A deposit of the same amount as the withdrawal amount and a bet of 3 times are required (full amount $ 5,000 / bet $ 15,000)"</p>
<p>・ When I asked, "Is this $ 5,000 full money treated as real money?", I got the answer, "Yes, it's real money."</p>
<hr />
<p>I've read through the terms of withdrawals and bonus withdrawals on the site in advance, but I couldn't find any such rules in the first place.</p>
<p>It seems to me a trap that casinos are being offered unreasonable conditions for late withdrawals because they are reluctant to withdraw large amounts of money.</p>
<p>I hope that this matter will be resolved (performance of withdrawal).</p>
