    <h1>Harrahs Casino Murphy Nc Birmingham Race Course Casino Seminole Casino Hotel Immokalee Meadows Casin</h1>

<p>The leading provider of games and software for the iGaming industry, Light &amp; Wonder, announced it expanded its collaboration with The Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians</p>
<p>On Friday, Light &amp; Wonder announced it has taken its collaboration with the federally recognized Native American tribe from Southern California to a new level.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Extends Deal with Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians</p>
<p>Extending its collaboration with the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians, Light &amp; Wonder agreed to provide its leading customer loyalty and engagement platform. As a result, the leading software will be integrated into the Tribe’s casino properties including Tortoise Rock Casino and Spotlight 29 Casino in California.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder explained that its loyalty solution will be integrated into the Tribe’s ACSC Casino Management System (CMS) platform which was developed by the company. Additionally, Twenty-Nine Palms’ Point of Sale (POS) systems, kiosks and Entertainment showrooms will benefit from engaging new options from Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>According to Light &amp; Wonder, the partnership extension already delivered multiple new features for Tortoise Rock Casino and Spotlight 29 Casino. Those features include CORE, which the company described as a system that helps with the configuration of loyalty program tiers, gifts and rewards. The two venues can also benefit from new promotions and offers. This enabled “retail offers to be setup within Light &amp; Wonder’s system and electronically redeemed by integration into InfoGenesis,” the company explained. Last but not least, the two venues can also leverage Publisher and Journey Builder. The solution boosts communication efforts via messages and emails, creating new customer engagement opportunities. This solution also allows the configuration of different loyalty events.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>The Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians’ vice president of information technology, Steve Libauskas, explained that the Tribe has already seen the benefits of the leading ACSC CMS platform provided by Light &amp; Wonder. “As we expand our contract with Light &amp; Wonder, we are thrilled about the integration of their new platform into our existing systems, including ACSC, and are confident that this will further allow us to drive engagement, player satisfaction and ultimately business,” he pointed out in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We value the long-time relationship and trust that we have cultivated with the casino properties of The Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians.“ Jon Wolfe, president of global systems and Services at Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s president of global systems and services, Jon Wolfe, was similarly excited about the extended collaboration. He said that the company values its business relationship with the Tribe. Finally, Wolfe said that the new platform will create new player experiences for Twenty-Nine Palms’ casino locations.</p>
