    <h1>All Inclusive Resorts With Casinos Ac Casino Map Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino In Mn Casino Sycuan</h1>

<p>Leading casino solutions provider Scientific Games Corporation and behemoth gambling operator Caesars Entertainment has recently launched a retail sportsbook solution at the Indiana Grand Racing &amp; Casino in Shelbyville, Indiana. This launch marks the debut of sports betting in Indiana and makes it the fifth state to go live with the sports betting offering from two companies. It has also set off an avalanche of launches with six more Caesars properties set to go live in the state this month, developments that will be a big boost to Indiana’s nascent sports betting market.</p>
<p>Thanks to the partnership’s sports betting offering, Indiana Grand Racing &amp; Casino now benefits from the full functionality of Scientific Games’ OpenSports product suite – this powers the retail sportsbook on the property and offers a ton of amazing features including seamless and intuitive user experience.</p>
<p>“We’ve had incredibly successful sportsbook launches, and Indiana is continuing that trend. We look forward to seeing OpenSports further engage our players with the sleek user experience and high transaction volume we’ve come to expect from OpenSports,” Christian Stuart, Executive Vice President of Gaming and Interactive Entertainment at Caesars, said.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment remains to be one of the most diversified casino-entertainment providers in the world. It is also one of the most geographically diverse casino and entertainment providers in the United States. As such it is the perfect gaming partner for Scientific Games which has also been looking for more expansion opportunities in the United States and other parts of the globe.</p>
<p>Further Expansion</p>
<p>After successful launches in Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Indiana earlier this year, the sports betting partnership between Caesars Entertainment and Scientific Games is set to grow further in newer markets. Illinois and North Carolina are next in line and will also have the OpenSports solutions introduced into their markets.</p>
<p>However, before that, bettors in Indiana are still set to see the launch of even more sports betting offering throughout the month of September. The OpenSports product suite will go live at Horseshoe Hammond, Horseshoe Southern Indiana Hotel and Casino, and Harrah’s Hoosier Park Racing &amp; Casino. In addition to those, there are also plans for off-track betting locations in New Haven, Indianapolis, and Clarksville.</p>
<p>Scientific Games also reportedly has plans to bring mobile sports betting to the Caesars-owned properties in Indiana, Iowa, and Pennsylvania. These launches will, of course, depend on prevailing gaming laws in the aforementioned states. With Caesars currently operating a total of 29 locations, sports bettors can expect to see more of Scientific Games’ offerings integrated into them.</p>
