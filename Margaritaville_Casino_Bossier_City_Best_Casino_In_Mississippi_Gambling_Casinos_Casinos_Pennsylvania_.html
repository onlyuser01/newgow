<p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) continues its battle against unlicensed operators in Australia. The regulator is hellbent on eliminating the black market and continues to request the blocking of more illegal websites.</p>
<p>The ACMA Blocked More Operators</p>
<p>2022 has been a busy year for the ACMA. The regulator continues its crusade against illegal online gambling operators in the country but despite its best efforts, more and more illegal sites keep sprouting. ACMA’s mission requires the authority’s constant efforts and the help of local internet service providers. Just now, the regulator announced a huge new batch of blocking orders.</p>
<p>The Australian authority deemed several online gambling operators to be illegal and asked internet providers to block access to their sites. The list includes names such as Bizz Casino, Blue Leo, Fab Spins, Hell Spin, Latinbet24, Ozbet88, RB Carnival, Sky Crown, Slots of Wins, Spin Oasis, The GoGo Room, Velvet Spin, Wabo88, Wolf Winner and Zenith Slots. All of these sites, according to the ACMA, lack a license to operate in Australia and are, therefore, in breach of the country’s gambling laws.</p>
<p>As per the regulator’s request, ISPs must now block access to all these websites. If providers refuse to comply with the orders, they risk getting penalized.</p>
<p>Offshore Brands Are Persistent</p>
<p>The problem with illegal gambling is that none of the proceeds are taxed. In addition, offshore sites rarely have adequate player protections and are less socially responsible when it comes to victims of gambling harm. In a new statement, the regulatory body reminded customers that many such brands do their best to look legitimate but are, in fact, not. As a result, the government cannot do anything if such a website refuses to pay out a customer’s winnings.</p>
<p>The ACMA has been banning unlicensed operators for almost three years now. During that time, the authority has banned over 600 black market companies.</p>
<p>In August, the ACMA asked ISPs to block additional six unlicensed websites. This included Wineramma, Win Paradise, Casino Moons, Extra Vegas, Gamblers Lab, and LegitGamblingSites.com. In June, the regulator also cracked down on ThePokies.com, one of the biggest offshore operators in Australia. The latter was popular because it offers live casino games, which are forbidden per Australian rule. The end of ThePokies.com’s operations in the country was a major victory for the ACMA.</p>
<p>In May, the ACMA announced the shutdown of 9 more illegal websites, namely Stay Casino, Bambet, Dazard Casino, Level Up Casino, Rocketplay Casino, Wild Tornado Casino, Cobra Casino, Cobra Bet, Casinority and Pokies Lab.</p>
