    <h1>Ozwin Casino No Deposit Bonus Skyriver Casino Fourwinds Casino Philadelphia Casino Casino In Wiscons</h1>

<p>Altenar, a global provider of sportsbook and iGaming software solutions, has an ambitious goal in mind, seeking to expand its footprint globally and become a brand that is synonymous with quality, trust, and reliability.</p>
<p>Already delivering an outstanding product, the company has been keen to strengthen its commercial output, something that it will seek to accomplish through the appointment of CharlieWilliams as the company’s new Commercial Director, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>Williams is a carefully-picked hire as he brings a trove of experience and will significantly bolster Altenar’s ongoing and ambitious plans for further global expansion, the company said in the statement.</p>
<p>He will be tasked with ensuring that Altenar completes its commercial strategy and adjusts its course as it goes along in order to address regional challenges and come up with a tailored approach for every market it seeks to grow into.</p>
<p>Williams will further assist the company to achieve sustainable growth, driving better lead generation, staying on top of sales management, and forming new partnerships. The man is also a known face in the industry, which has earned him the trust and respect of Altenar right from the start.</p>
<p>Williams himself has presided over successful exits and he is well-versed in the commercial needs of the companies he has held leadership positions with, including other B2B iGaming suppliers. Altenar COO and co-founder Dinos Stranomitis were excited to welcome the new appointee.</p>
<p>Stranomitis said that he was confident in the role that Williams will play in the company, commending his leadership skills and strong entrepreneurial mindset. He added that Williams is a creative strategist with exceptional organizational abilities, and so on.</p>
<p>"His expertise and background across multiple roles will no doubt stand us in good stead globally and will strengthen our outreach as a leading sportsbook across a variety of markets," Stranomitis said.</p>
<p>Williams himself, now speaking from his position as a Commercial Director, was also excited about the appointment, and was very much looking forward to making an impact on the company’s results.</p>
<p>He said that as part of the company, he will now seek to strengthen its performance in Europe and Latin America, but also pay attention to other regions that are of importance to Altenar, including the United Kingdom, North America, and the Nordics.</p>
<p>"Our primary objective is to pursue business in regulated markets, while also supporting our growth in newly regulated jurisdictions," Williams explained. Presently, Altenar is authorized to operate in 13 global markets, and holds notable certifications, including from some of the most respectable gambling operators, to name the UK Gambling Commission and the Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
