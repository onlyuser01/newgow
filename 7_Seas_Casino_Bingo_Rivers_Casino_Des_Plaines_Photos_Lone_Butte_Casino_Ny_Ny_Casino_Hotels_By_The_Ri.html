    <h1>7 Seas Casino Bingo Rivers Casino Des Plaines Photos Lone Butte Casino Ny Ny Casino Hotels By The Ri</h1>

<p>This casino allowed me to deposit and spend money on there casino, even though im registered with gam stop. I am a problem gambler and suffer from complex personality disorder, i feel this casino have promoted false incentives to lur people in however not falling through with there promises and it seems like games are corrupt. After telling the casino i am requesting a refund of my deposits since there unfair bonus structure where the staff member had persistently lied to me about the structure of the wagering requirements on the bonus, even though i had it in screenshots telling me otherwise from the company website, the advisor was trying to tell me that several deposit bonuses which i was awarded were expired / however they had no expiry date on them, which some others did, since there was a total of 180 spins i was due to be awarded that also had no wagering requirements which also wasn't stated anywhere that they had wagering requirements as soon as i checked the situation changed, and they had gone from x60 then down to x35 when there was none to begin with. I feel like the casino took an opportunity here to not follow through with there promises and didn't want to cough up the rewards after which i was already credited.</p>
<p>The website layout isn't that appealing since there is no advertised section on the homepage that directs you to the bonus section of the website, with it being in the ACCOUNT SETTINGS section hidden in the corner of the top right page. Usually From previous experience the Bonus page within any casino is clearly advertised as are any incentives won from the games. Its like they are trying to hide the bonus section of the website to save on the free spins advertised. Also by the sign up offer i used with this company stated 100 wager free spins, however i was given 50 spins that had wagering requirements since the staff member had advised me that the offer i presented was not valid. However it is even advertised on here (CASINO GURU) as 100 spins, with no 0x wagering requirements. I have requested my entire deposits back due to the issues i have faced here and they have now deleted my account, before that they advised that i need to contact gam stop myself CCing them in an email for them to obtain my file. However shouldn't they be able to do that themselves since they are under gam stop as advertised on the website?</p>
