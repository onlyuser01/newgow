    <h1>Durant Oklahoma Casino Lucky Land Casino Login Oceans Casino Resort L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Cha</h1>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>i’ve been talking with the support on Axecasino (a Dama n.v brand). Earlier i closed myself out from all Dama n.v casinos, had the answer that i can’t create account on any Dama n.v casino anymore due to gambling issues.</p>
<p>later on after this i started playing on Axecasino, i lost around 2.600 eur i deposits and now i asked for a refund, i did not check that they were a Dama n.v brand, the refused to refund me, the other Dama n.v casinos did refund me, got the last refund yesterday from Bitkingz, waiting now on the refund from iLucki, they told me that the refund was on the way.</p>
<p>now, here is the deal! Axecasino do not want to refund me, they ignore all my messages, even the form submissions on their homepage and emails to support@axecasino.com</p>
<p>the support also blocked my IP from using their online chat (they admitted that when i used a vpn to contact them).</p>
<p>Today i asked were my refund was and they told me the money has been sent to me, i should just wait to recieve them, i was so happy that my case was finalt solved, even mentioned casino.guru and there was no problems. Came back later to ask how long time they think it would take, then they told me that there was no refund, they would not send back those money but they closed my acc due to gambling issues.</p>
<p>how can this seriously be okey?</p>
