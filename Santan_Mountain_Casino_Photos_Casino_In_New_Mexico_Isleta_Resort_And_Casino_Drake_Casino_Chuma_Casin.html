<p>FansUnite Entertainment has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Lovell Brothers Limited, the owners of the Dragon Bet brand. As a result, Lovell Brothers will launch a dedicated branded sports betting website in the Wales and UK markets, which will be based on the FansUnite Chameleon iGaming platform.</p>
<p>DragonBet.co.uk will run entirely on the FansUnite advanced tech solution as exemplified by the Chameleon platform. The partnership will enable Dragon Bet to fully benefit from the FansUnite white-label betting software and build customizable betting options and experiences for sports fans.</p>
<p>Creating a New Welsh Sports Betting Product</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership FansUnite CEO Scott Burton welcomed the opportunity to be joining hands with Dragon Bet and help establish the brand on the igaming market in the United Kingdom. He commended FansUnite efforts which have resulted in the wide-scale adoption and awareness of the company’s own products and added:</p>
<p>This recognition has allowed us to partner with Dragon Bet where we will assist them with their plans to become the top Welsh bookmaker. FansUnite CEO Scott Burton</p>
<p>A big part of the focus will be on Wales with Dragon Bet planning to secure market leadership with fans from the country. John Lovell Racing is particularly focused on the market as well and its rebranding to Dragon Bet will hopefully result in an increased interest in the brand and what it has to offer.</p>
<p>David Lovell, director and co-founder of Dragon Bet, is confident that this is the right move for his company, adding:</p>
<p>Dragon Bet is the digital rebranding of John Lovell Racing, a prominent Welsh bookmaker and we are excited to launch our new online wagering platform with FansUnite. Dragon Bet director and co-founder David Lovell</p>
<p>Lovell explained that the rebranding move was not a spur-of-the-moment decision either. It came after carefully thinking it through and shopping around for the right platform that would help the move to succeed. After a while, Chameleon stood out as the preferred platform for the brand.</p>
<p>A Big Focus on the Welsh Sports Betting Fans</p>
<p>He assured that moving forward, the brand will continue to focus on the market in Wales and continue to grow its digital footprint in the country in order to meet the expectations and needs of modern sports bettors. Dragon Bet will focus on the Welsh culture and sense of national pride, he said.</p>
<p>FansUnite is clearly benefiting from this arrangement as the company has been committed to scaling its geographical footprint, and a better presence in the UK market is definitely an important steppingstone for the firm.</p>
<p>Part of this ambition is backed by the creation of a powerful single-entry igaming platform, to wit Chameleon, which allows for the seamless integration and launch of sports and esports products tailored to appeal to the “next generation of players.”</p>
<p>Chameleon is capable of delivering anything that consumers may need, including in-play betting, fantasy contests, esports betting, and even random number generator-powered solutions such as casino-style games of chance. FansUnite has a strong presence in both the B2C and B2B brands and is continuing to grow its footprint in the industry.</p>
