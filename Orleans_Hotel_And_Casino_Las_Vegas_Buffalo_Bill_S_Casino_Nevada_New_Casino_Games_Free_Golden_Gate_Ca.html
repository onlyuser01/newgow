<p>Hong Kong Police Officers Found Guilty of Warning Triad Boss of Gambling Den Raid</p>

<p>The Wo Shing Wo triad is one of Asia’s most entrenched criminal organizations, particularly Hong Kong. It’s survived for so long because of help from inside the police force, and three officers have been found guilty in court for giving it assistance.</p>

<p>The three officers tipped off the gang to a surprise police raid that was going to take place on one of its illegal gambling dens in 2018, according to the South China Morning Post.</p>
<p>Sergeant Chiu Kwong-lam and constables Lai Fuk-hong and Fu Yu-man, all long-time Hong Kong Police Force officers, now face up to seven years in prison. A fourth officer, Constable Cheung Tsz-kin, is free over a lack of evidence.</p>
<p>The triad would have likely suffered a huge blow if law enforcement had been able to carry out the raid. Instead, the four corrupt officials unwittingly unveiled the plan to a fifth individual, not realizing that he was an undercover officer who had infiltrated the triad.</p>
<p>Police Corruption Facilitates Triad Activity</p>
<p>The police officers had been informing people within the Tsuen Wan group, a faction of the Wo Sing Wo triad, about the impending raid. To derail the police investigation, the officers were going to set up a phony operation, complete with paid actors as gamblers. At the same time, the triad would move its gambling operation to a different location.</p>
<p>The goal was to put distance between the triad and the police. Of course, the actors would take the fall. But nothing was going to lead the police to the real operation.</p>
<p>To coordinate the subversion, triad bosses put the crooked cops in contact with one of their associates. That associate, unbeknownst to everyone, was an undercover cop who had previously established a role of confidence within the gang.</p>
<p>Days before the raid occurred, all five met at a police station. There, the undercover officer learned from the others what was going on, how they were going to pull it off, and who was organizing the operation. The undercover officer didn’t break character and later informed his superiors of what was happening.</p>
<p>As a result, they called off the raid and arrested the corrupt officers.</p>
<p>Chiu, Lai, and Fu had no escape in the trial that had just wrapped up. They had delivered all of the incriminating evidence first-hand to the undercover officer. Now, they will remain in prison and return to a courtroom in September for sentencing.</p>
<p>The judge presiding over the case dismissed the charges against Cheung. The court determined that he did not knowingly participate in the activity. Instead, possibly because of a lack of experience with the force, he only followed orders.</p>
<p>Weak Defense Doesn’t Sway Judge</p>
<p>The corrupt officers’ defense team mounted an incredulous defense that never really stood a chance. They thought they could convince the judge that the undercover officer was not a reliable source of information and, therefore, his testimony was invalid.</p>
<p>To support their arguments, they used examples of the officer’s work. This included violating internal police protocols, participating in illegal activity, and unexcused absences from work. However, all the examples were from his undercover involvement with the triad.</p>
<p>Logically, the court rejected the attempts. In addition, it also received evidence showing how the officers had altered official records and ordered a raid delay. As a result, they had no suitable defense for their actions and will now pay the price.</p>
