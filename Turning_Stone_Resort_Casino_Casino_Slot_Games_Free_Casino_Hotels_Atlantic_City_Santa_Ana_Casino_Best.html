<p>Paysafe has appointed Alex Gersh as the company’s new chief financial officer with the man stepping into his new role on October 3. Gersh is a gaming and sports betting industry veteran, having worked as CFO at Sportradar, his most recent position he is now leaving for Paysafe. He has 25 years of industry-related experience and has worked with other strong companies in the sector.</p>
<p>Gersh Brings More Than Two Decades of Experience</p>
<p>He was CFO at Paddy Power Betfair prior to the company becoming part of Flutter Entertainment, and he has been familiar with the ins and outs of the industry for the past two decades. His appointment is important for Paysafe, as remarked by company chief executive officer Bruce Lowthers, who said that Gersh brings a diverse skill set and has a proven track record for growth at international companies. He added:</p>
<p>I know he will be a real asset to our team as we continue our path to accelerate growth and drive long-term value for all our stakeholders. Paysafe chief executive officer Bruce Lowthers</p>
<p>Lowthers praised the outgoing CFO Ismail Dawood who has contributed a lot to Paysafe’s business model in the past years. Gersh thanked this opportunity to become a part of the company and its digital payments offering.</p>
<p>Gersh assured that his previous experience with some of the biggest companies in the sector will help him steer Paysafe’s product better and confirmed that he looks forward to being a part of the company’s ambitious growth future. Growth is definitely one of the company’s objectives.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Paysafe confirmed that it’s introducing an eCard solution to Argentina. In the United States, the company’s payment products have been some of the most used and trusted solutions for the iGaming and sports betting sectors.</p>
<p>Gersh will no doubt be part of all future plans for the company, bringing his trove of experience in a way that allows Paysafe to scale and navigate the lucrative opportunities ahead.</p>
