    <h1>Wild Casino Review The Ocean Casino Bet777 Eu Casino Download Directions To Hard Rock Casino Prism C</h1>

<p>Provider of payment and customer engagement technology Passport Technology registered the first expansion of its loyalty solution in the Pacific Northwest via an agreement with The Point Casino.</p>
<p>Lush Loyalty and Mira Kiosks</p>
<p>The agreement between Passport Technology and The Point Casino &amp; Hotel saw the casino in Washington choose Passport’s Lush loyalty and rewards platform and Mira player enrollment kiosks, and marked the first expansion of the tech supplier’s loyalty solution in the region.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, vice president of operations and general manager of The Point Casino, Sam Cocharo, said that the solution provided by Passport Technology “looks great” and that the casino management is excited at the opportunity to offer Lush loyalty to the casino players. “The offers we can provide are exciting and fun, and our players are going to love this new addition to our lineup,” Cocharo concluded.</p>
<p>The Lush loyalty platform provides casino operators with tools such as customizable games, promotions and dynamic offers and opens up new opportunities for them to increase player enrollment and engagement.</p>
<p>Chief operating officer of Passport Technology, John Steely, outlined that the company has traditionally provided cash, cage automation and floor efficiency solutions to the gaming market in Washington, “with a heavy emphasis on product and service.”</p>
<p>“Passport’s ability to further serve the Washington market with Lush is an opportunity to spoil our customers, present and future, with loyalty solutions that bring our service offering full circle within the resort,” he added.</p>
<p>Engagement through Customization</p>
<p>The industry’s first HTML5-based loyalty platform allows operators to customize branding, gamification, virtual drawings, multipliers, and even patron-specific promotions, while the kiosks offer casino guests benefits from features such as player club enrollment, card reprints, dynamic games, and others, utilizing the industry’s first Earn and Shop redemption portal for instant point redemption.</p>
<p>Diallo Gordon, principal of Digital Wallet, Loyalty &amp; Innovation at Passport Technology, outlined The Point Casino as “the right partner” for the tech provider’s loyalty platform to enter the market in Washington in pursuit of its growth strategy.</p>
<p>On the Lush solution, Gordon said that it “will serve as a growth conduit” for the casino, helping it to “acquire, retain and grow its impressive customer base with a broad suite of loyalty tools aimed at customer lifetime value, self-service efficiency, and guest satisfaction.”</p>
<p>Outside of Washington, the Lush platform was selected by San Diego-based Jamul Casino earlier this year as part of a new partnership between the casino and Passport Technology.</p>
<p>Passport Technology entered Washington via a deal with the Angel of the Winds Casino Resort in September 2021, and in February this year, the tech provider expanded its presence in the state by entering into a partnership with Lucky Eagle Casino.</p>
