<p>If they beat the New York Jets in the Thursday Night Football game of Week 15, that number will go up to 45%. That definitely is good enough motivation for Doug Pederson’s boys to give their utmost on their trip to East Rutherford.</p>

<p>Atmosphere is Great in the Jacksonville Jaguars Locker Room</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Dallas Cowboys 40-34 in overtime after 34-34 in regulation. Even though they were four-point underdogs before the game, they ended up winning thanks to an inspired performance in the second half.</p>
<p>QB Trevor Lawrence was superb in that game with 24/42 for 318 yards and four touchdowns. One of his passes got intercepted, and he also made one fumble very late in the game. In fact, it was 34-31 for the Cowboys with under two minutes left on the clock. Lawrence run away from his opponents but then got the ball knocked from his arms in the crucial moment.</p>
<p>Luckily for him, the Jags defense saved the day. They stopped the Cowboys offense deep in their half, getting the ball back to Lawrence. This time, the Jags did well, with Riley Patterson scoring a three-point field goal to take the game to overtime.</p>
<p>Then, it was Jacksonville’s defense that got in the spotlight once again – safety Rayshawn Jenkins made a game-winning pick-six for the Jaguars’ sixth win of the season.</p>
<p>As a result, they’re now 6-8 with three more games to play. After playing the New York Jets in Week 16, they get to play against the Houston Texans on the first day of 2023, and against the Tennessee Titans in the final round of the regular season.</p>
<p>New York Jets Desperate for a Win</p>
<p>The New York Jets are 7-7 on the season, meaning that they still have a chance to make the playoffs. The trouble is that their players are completely out of form at the moment. This team is 0-3 in December with their last win happening in November when they defeated the Chicago Bears, one of the league’s worst teams.</p>
<p>Their defense has been very good, despite poor results. In fact, the Jets have one of the best defensive teams in the league. Their offense, however, hasn’t been as great, which explains why this team’s scoring average is just 17.0 in December.</p>
<p>They need to up their game ASAP; otherwise, they can say goodbye to their playoff dreams. Unfortunately, even if they beat the Jets on Thursday, it won’t mean the end. They’d (probably) also need at least one more win in the remainder of the season, in which they got to play the Seattle Seahawks and the Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars vs New York Jets Prediction</p>
<p>Player quality-wise, these two teams are very similar. However, the Jaguars are in much better shape right now. They’re playing great with confidence being sky-high among their key men. Lawrence is playing fantastic football at the moment, looking like someone who can break the Jets’ defensive wall.</p>
<p>Picks: Jacksonville Jaguars to win; under to hit</p>
