<p>California is very keen to take its cue from Florida and legalize sports gambling, but the groundwork is being laid differently in the two states. Florida has the Seminole Tribe which has been successful in passing a sweeping reform through a skillfully negotiated state compact.</p>
<p>California, and the California Nationals Indian Gaming Association (CNIGA), are adamantly opposed to a recently pitched proposal by Eagle1 Acquisitions Corp., LLC which seeks to expand gambling to include sports wagering, promising gains for tribal and commercial businesses.</p>
<p>Yet, CNIGA and 28 tribes asked Eagle1 Acquisitions Corp., LLC top brass in the face of Ryan Tyler Walz, Reeve Collins, and Kasey Thompson to consider forfeiting their proposal, and pointing out to the realities that are that without enough support from the tribes, the proposal is not very likely to move forward.</p>
<p>Since the first mention of the so-called Sports Wagering Regulation and Tribal Gaming Protection Act pitched by Eagle1, tribes have been agog, with prominent leaders blasting the issue and arguing that it feigned interest in protecting tribes in the first place.</p>
<p>The biggest tribes that own gaming and other businesses have already voiced their disapproval of the measure and are not going to back it.</p>
<p>CNIGA though considers the implications of a failed vote as, at least on the outside, the association is worried about what a failed vote in 2024 could do to the further efforts to pass sports gambling. In 2022, a proposal was already struck down with overwhelming opposition and admittedly at the height of an acrimonious and heated public debate.</p>
<p>Tribes are not really sure when sports gambling can be passed in the state, but the earliest outlook for the state is 2026 according to CNIGA. To make sure sports betting actually takes root, though, tribes propose to tread lightly and not cause a stir by adding mobile betting to any initial efforts to pass sports gambling.</p>
<p>Eagle1 is unlikely to be placated by those appeals, though, as the group seems to be confident enough that it has a shot at passing sports gambling legalization with votersâ€™ approval in 2024. Whether this is indeed the case remains to be seen over the coming months.</p>
<p>"The opposition coming from Indian Country is loud and it is clear. Tribes will not be distracted by outside influences making empty promises. Indian Country will stand firm in protecting our sovereign rights and integrity. We call on the proponents to do the honorable thing and withdraw these flawed initiatives," a statement published by CNIGA last week read.</p>
