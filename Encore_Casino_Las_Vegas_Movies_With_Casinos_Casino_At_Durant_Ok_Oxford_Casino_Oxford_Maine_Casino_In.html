    <h1>Encore Casino Las Vegas Movies With Casinos Casino At Durant Ok Oxford Casino Oxford Maine Casino In</h1>

<p>I've won 300â‚¬ on Supacasi and I've uploaded all my necessary documents before I tried to withdraw the amount via bank transfer.</p>
<p>The first time the withdrawal got canceled because the casino wanted another proof of deposit.</p>
<p>I've sent them another and and it got canceled again because it was not enough (Although all my personal data, bank account,... were visible)</p>
<p>I forgot to say that every time the casino took 2 days to reply, when I've submitted a new document.</p>
<p>Then I've send them the next proof of deposit. After 2-3 days not responding I got the next message, that they want a selfie with my passport visible on the photo.</p>
<p>So far, so good. Already over 1 week has passed and I sent them the selfie with the passport right after I got the mail.</p>
<p>3 days later (Yesterday) I got another mail that my withdrawal got canceled AGAIN and now they want a document of my phone provider with my name visible.</p>
<p>It's just a stalling tactic, what's next? Should I provide a urine sample? my birth certificate? I've dealt with blatant scammers like this many times, casinos who hope that every time you're stalled for 3 days, you'll gamble your balance.</p>
<p>I'm now waiting 3 weeks and they don't respond to my mails anymore.</p>
