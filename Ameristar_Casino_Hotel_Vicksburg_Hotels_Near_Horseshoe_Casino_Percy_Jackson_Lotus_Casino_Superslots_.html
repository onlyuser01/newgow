<p>Comtrade said it is committed to offering best-in-class products to its partnering operators</p>
<p>Livespins, an award-winning product that taps into streaming to deliver modern and socially-charged iGaming experiences, has partnered with Comtrade to bolster its distribution. As agreed, Comtrade will offer Livespins to its partnering operators, allowing them to spice up their offerings with a beloved casino product.</p>
<p>Livespins is a product where players can wager behind their favorite streamers, celebrities or brand ambassadors while discussing the spins in a chatroom and sharing their experiences. The social element elevates the gaming experience, providing excitement with each spin.</p>
<p>The new deal will expand Livespins’ global footprint, allowing it to reach multiple tier-one operators. For reference, Comtrade partners with many notable industry powerhouses, such as Mansion Group and its M88 brand.</p>
<p>The Livespins experience continuously levels up with the addition of new games from industry-leading studios. The product features titles from Yggdrasil, Relax Gaming, iSoftBet and other major companies, allowing Livespins’ streamers to connect with many different players.</p>
<p>Some of the latest additions to the Livespins experience include titles from studios such as SlotMatrix, 4ThePlayer and REEVO.</p>
<p>Comtrade Seeks to Offer Best-in-Class Products to Its Clients</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the agreement with Livespins’ chief commercial officer, Michael Pedersen, saying that the deal with Comtrade will allow his team to bring slot streaming to more operators than ever before.</p>
<p>Comtrade is focused on powering only the biggest casinos in markets across the world, so this partnership will add high-caliber brands to our growing line-up of operator partners. Michael Pedersen, CCO, Livespins</p>
<p>Pedersen added that his team is committed to promoting gambling in a responsible fashion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Comtrade’s chief commercial officer, Steven Valentine, said that his team believes in value-driven technology. He also said that the provider would “go to great lengths” to secure best-in-class products for its partnering operators and noted that the partnership with Livespins is in line with this philosophy.</p>
<p>Casino and slot streaming is big and will only get bigger. Livespins allows operators to capitalize on this in a way that is responsible and compliant, providing an entirely new way for them to experience online casino. Steven Valentine, CCO, Comtrade</p>
<p>Valentine said that the integration of Livespins into its portfolio is a “strong addition” to his company’s offerings. The move, he concluded, would solidify Comtrade as the “go-to technology partner for the biggest online casino brands in the world.”</p>
<p>In June, Comtrade Gaming agreed to provide its RGS technology to 10 Ten Gaming.</p>
