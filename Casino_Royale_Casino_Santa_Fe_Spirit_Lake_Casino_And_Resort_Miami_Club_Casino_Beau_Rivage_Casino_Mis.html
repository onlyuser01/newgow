    <h1>Casino Royale Casino Santa Fe Spirit Lake Casino And Resort Miami Club Casino Beau Rivage Casino Mis</h1>

<p>Parx Casino has become the latest pioneer in the delivery of player-focused solutions that will help the property optimize the way visitors experience its gaming floor through the addition of cashless payment options delivered by Sightline. The partnership also sees Light &amp; Wonder participate through its advanced cross-platform gaming solution and management system.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Sightline’s Play+ technology will be used as part of the Parx Wallet and enable players to enjoy cashless play which will help with property and gaming floor management, and also offer distinct benefits to players who are looking to focus on the gaming experience solely and not worry about the registration process at a casino.</p>
<p>The Parx Wallet app is directly integrated with the casino management system provided by Light &amp; Wonder which covers the entire gaming facilities. The casino features 260,000 square feet of gaming space and holds 3,000 slot machines, a dedicated poker table with 50 tables, and 200 table games. All of this comes alongside other amenities, food and beverage venues located across the property, and more.</p>
<p>This marks an important step forward for the property which has doubled down on embracing innovation. Parx Casino Chief Marketing Officer Marc Oppenheimer was stoked to see the opportunity of launching the Parx Wallet solution to provide customers with further opportunities and improve overall safety and security. Oppenheimer had no doubt that cashless is the way to move forward for the entire property:</p>
<p>"The ability to play cashless across our more than 3,000 slot machines with the Parx Wallet and Play+ will provide our customers with easy access to their funds both on and off the property."</p>
<p>To access the cashless payment solution, customers need to be part of the X-Club loyalty program supported by Parx, which enables them to set up their Parx Play+ account and benefit from the opportunity to fund their activities when gaming. Sightline is also a leader in the delivery of cashless tech and a proponent of the solution.</p>
<p>The company’s Chief Client Solutions Officer, Mandi Hart, confirmed that the partnership was of equal importance to Sightline as well. He also said that Play+ had a robust reputation for providing excellent cashless solutions that are a benchmark in the market.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder SVP and President of Global Systems &amp; Services, Gaming, Jon Wolfe, was similarly pleased with this new partnership opportunity.</p>
<p>He welcomed the opportunity to facilitate new technological opportunities for businesses and players, especially when this is done with the help of Sightline. This, Wolfe said, was a clear-cut way for Light &amp; Wonder to remain "one of the industry’s leaders." Previously, Sightline launched a cashless gaming option with Resorts World Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Cashless gaming has been the subject of fierce debate. ClubsNSW previously suggested that the introduction of cashless technology across New South Wales in Australia could actually undermine the regulated gaming market.</p>
