<p>Johansson further commented on the unique project and called streaming something “essential to the modern online slot experience”, considering Mystic Spells to be the ideal game for this particular environment.</p>
<p>Similarly, Casinolytics’ co-founder, Johan Sandén, spoke about the foundation of the new slot that revolves around AI-generated data analysis meant to measure the “popularity of mechanics and features.”</p>
<p>Sandén was joined by fellow co-founder Sebastian Khalighy in his comments about the new release. The latter spoke about the massive role played by streamers in enabling certain games to stand out in today’s online gaming market, while also offering an ideal opportunity to “deep-dive into player behaviors and feelings.”</p>
<p>In June 2022, Fantasma boosted its partnership with Light &amp; Wonder by delivering its slot-based content to Quebec’s provincial lotto and iGaming operator, Loto-Québec. The following month of the same year, the studio announced the release of the Cloud Corsairs slot.</p>
