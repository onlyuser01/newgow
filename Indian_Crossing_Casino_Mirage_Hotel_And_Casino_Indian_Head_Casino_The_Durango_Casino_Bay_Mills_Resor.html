<p>In addition to the new accreditation, the company is also ISO 27001 and ISO 20000 certified</p>
<p>EveryMatrix, an iGaming software provider, has received a new certification thanks to its commitment to high standards.</p>
<p>As announced by the company, it received the World Lottery Association Security Control Standard 2020 Level 2 certification (WLA-SCS Level 2), a distinction that few companies manage to achieve. WLA-SCS Level 2, EveryMatrix noted, is the most complete and comprehensive certification standard for sports betting and lottery operators and suppliers.</p>
<p>The accreditation was awarded following a thorough audit that was carried out by Gaming Laboratories International, the industry’s top testing and certification services. According to EveryMatrix, the standard features 21 controls for suppliers of lottery tech. These evaluate a company’s use of cloud hosting for lottery gaming systems and its controls concerning privacy and app security.</p>
<p>Luckily, EveryMatrix managed to pass the test, proving that it deserves the certification. As mentioned by the company, both its sports betting &amp; iGaming and iLottery platforms passed the certification audit without GLI finding any non-conformities.</p>
<p>The accreditation comes a month after EveryMatrix announced stellar Q1 results.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Prioritizes Security</p>
<p>Ebbe Groes, EveryMatrix’s chief executive officer, praised the newly-secured accreditation, highlighting the importance of security to his company.</p>
<p>Security is a top priority for EveryMatrix and achieving compliance with this rigorous standard is proof of our commitment to our existing and future WLA customers. Ebbe Groes, CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>The company noted that the WLA-SCS Level 2 certification is not its first and only accolade. In addition to that, the company is also ISO 27001 and ISO 20000 certified, further emphasizing its capabilities as a tech supplier. The three certifications also attest to EveryMatrix’s overall “steadfast commitment” to security, reliability, quality and customer service.</p>
<p>Thanks to the quality of its products and its commitment to excellence, EveryMatrix has existing agreements with many notable lottery and betting organizations all over Europe. These include agreements with World Lottery Association and European Lotteries members, such as the Norwegian brand Norsk Tipping, the Greek operator OPAP, Malta’s National Lottery, Finland’s Veikkaus and the Hungarian gaming and lottery giant Szerencsejáték.</p>
<p>Some of the provider’s latest business agreements include the launch of its proprietary CasinoEngine in Nigeria with BetKing, as well as the approval of its RGS Casino Content in Bulgaria and its Jackpot Engine in Malta. Earlier this month, the B2B company also integrated Future Anthem’s Amplifier AI into its platform, further reinforcing its products.</p>
