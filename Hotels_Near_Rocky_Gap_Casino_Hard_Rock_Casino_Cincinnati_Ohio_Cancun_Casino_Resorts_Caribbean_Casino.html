    <h1>Hotels Near Rocky Gap Casino Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati Ohio Cancun Casino Resorts Caribbean Casino</h1>

<p>After using a "no deposit bonus" to test the casino worth 100€, I ended up winning over 2500€. From the beginning, I knew that the withdrawal limit was 100€, as it was clearly indicated in the bonus information.</p>
<p>After meeting the wager requirements, I tried withdrawing the permitted winnings - 100€. It took 5 days (through cryptocurrency - the sole method of payment and withdrawal) for them to begin the validation process (which takes even longer, about 1 or 2 days), during which they requested that I send in my passport for identity verification.</p>
<p>They don’t accept any other document as proof of identity, even though I was willingly offering to send my National ID card, Driver's License Card, etc.</p>
<p>In their Terms and Conditions, they don’t mention the exclusive need for a passport, nor do they state that they do not accept any other government-issued document from your country.</p>
<p>In fact, the site's verification process itself accepts a National ID card or Driver's License, which is later invalidated by the casino’s compliance department.</p>
<p>This is clearly a case of omission of information in the Terms and Conditions, which they then use as a procedure for not paying out the winnings. In other words, it's a SCAM!</p>
<p>Out of all the casinos I've used, this is the only one to date that has asked for a passport and rejects any other proof of identification.</p>
