    <h1>Chicken Ranch Casino Free Casino Bus Rides Near Me Marriott Resort And Stellaris Casino Milky Way On</h1>

<p>Evoplay has launched X-Demon Bonus Buy, a sequel to the original slot with an underworld mythology theme, special symbols, and free spins</p>
<p>The recipient of the Best Slots Provider in the Blatics award at the BSG Awards 2023 has announced the return of the hellish odyssey that takes place in the underworld.</p>
<p>In X-Demon Bonus Buy, players are invited to once again enter a portal to reach the demon dimension and collect interesting rewards on their way to the inferno. In this sequel with an added Bonus Buy feature, players can also keep an eye on the Wild Attack feature, bonus symbols, and free spins.</p>
<p>Evoplay launched the first game in the series in May, the same month when the studio also released Irish Weekend Bonus Buy, a fresh slot with Free Spins and an Ultra Spins Bonus.</p>

<p>Resist the Abyss of Hell with Even More Free Spins</p>
<p>Players who decide to enter the “portal of unimaginable power” in the latest installment in the hellish series get to arm themselves with additional force in the form of extra Free Spins.</p>
<p>The iGaming development studio has included the Bonus Buy option as a means of helping players stop the demons from entering the human realm. With the help of the new feature, all inferno creatures will instantly vanquish while the good energy provided by the large wins will replace the darkness and evil spirits.</p>
<p>Players who proceed to collect the beaten monsters while engaged in the Free Spins round and replace them with Wild symbols are rewarded with even more mouth-watering winning combinations.</p>
<p>Fend Off the Hordes of Monsters and Scoop Up Heroic Wins</p>
<p>X-Demon Bonus Buy comes with several appealing features, including the Wild Attack feature where Wild Attack symbols will be seen popping up on the top row. Wild Attack symbols showing up on the top row with a high-paying Demon symbol attached to them will have the Demon turn the Wild. Next, the winning combinations will be generated and the Wilds will replace the rest of the symbols with the exception of any Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>During the Bonus Symbol feature, players can trigger eight free spins with the help of three Bonus symbols, 10 free spins via four Bonus symbols, and 12 free spins with five Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>In the Free Spins game, all Demon symbols have their own collection counter letting players know how many Demons they still have left. Provided the Wild Attack feature is engaged on the top row with the attached Demon symbol below it while the Free Spins game is engaged, the Demon symbol will proceed to turn the Wild and further diminish the Demon collections.</p>
<p>When the Demon collection is completed, the Demon symbol will be shown as a Golden Wild symbol for the remainder of the Free Spins game. The Bonus Buy feature lets players purchase eight, 10, or 12 Free Spins.</p>
<p>In March, the company expanded its presence in the Baltics via a content agreement inked with Uniclub Lithuania. The following month, Evoplay announced a similar deal with Tuko Productions for the Italian market.</p>
