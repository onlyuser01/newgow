<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Ankh, Anubis, and Ancient Egypt</p>
<p>Cleopatra’s Fortune is one of the most thematic games you will come across. Set in the familiar and exotic setting of Ancient Egypt, the game is rich in its visuals and execution. The grid is a rather traditional five-by-three setup cast against traditional Egyptian architecture. Golden rims run around the reels to make it easier to focus on the gameplay.</p>
<p>There are no animated elements in the backdrop here, but they need not be with the game symbols being as rich and opulent as they are. There are all the elements you would normally associate with Ancient Egypt, including an ankh, a scarab, and an Anubis, as well as a Pharaoh Sarcophagus which is the Bonus Symbol.</p>
<p>Dragon Gaming has not gone too heavily thematic on the rest of the symbols though, using neatly polished card suit denominations such as diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades to illustrate the payouts. Although a bit of an anachronism, these symbols still make sense and add to the overall theme and completionist look of Cleopatra’s Fortune setting the game apart in terms of theme, originality, and recognizability among players.</p>
<p>Cleopatra’s Fortune Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Speaking of symbols, we will now take a deeper dive into how these work. The clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds are the low-paying symbols in the game, and they will pay out 10x, 50x, or 150x, depending on how many of them you get lined up on the reels.</p>
<p>The next higher paying symbol is the Ankh which will pay 30x, 150x, and 450x. The Scarab Beetle will pay 20x, 100x, and 300x, and not least, there is the Anubis, which fetches the biggest and juiciest payouts in the game, with 150x, 300x, and 1,000x for 3, 4 and 5 symbols of a kind respectively.</p>
<p>The Wild Symbol in the game is shaped like Cleopatra herself and will allow you to complete paylines that may have one or two odd symbols missing. Besides those, there is the Bonus symbol, which is shaped like a Pharoah Sarcophagus, Tutankhamun, and allows you to enter the Free Spins game where you may win up to 20 bonus rounds. There are also different levels of the bonus level – five of them.</p>
<p>Each will be slightly different from the previous one. Level 1 will have Stick Wild Reel and 1 Extra Free Spin. Level 2 will come with 2x Multiplier and 1 Extra Free Spin. Level 3 will feature a 2nd Sticky Wild Reel and also come with 2 Extra Free Spins.</p>
<p>Level 4 will change the direction of the payout, with both ways paying now, and feature 2 Extra Free Spins. Finally, there is the Level 5 bonus level which features a 3rd Sticky Wild Reel and 2 Extra Free Spins, for the best experience possible!</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Dragon Gaming has spared no effort in crafting a game that is excellent in terms of visual and sound quality. Players will experience a title that is designed to appeal to any taste while staying true to the setting of the Egyptian time period.</p>
<p>The colors are nice and sharp, and there are subtle details that are tucked away in the background to create a full picture of a game that is based on a historical period. The music is a nice oriental mix that is cinematic quality and instills a sense of wonder and awe in players who get to relive the glory days of Ancient Egypt through scores of meticulously crafted music.</p>
<p>Cleopatra’s Fortune Gameplay</p>
<p>As to the actual gameplay, Cleopatra’s Fortune is very easy to follow. The betting limits will range from $0.10 to $100 across 10 paylines and bet sizes. You can calibrate the size of the bet by using the “+” and “-“ buttons that allow you to easily adjust the size as you see fit.</p>
<p>The balance is displayed and updated in real-time, and you will see your win result in a separate box even if the animation has disappeared from the screen. There is a quick Max Bet shortcut, and you can also adjust an Autoplay feature with up to 1000 spins if you want to.</p>
<p>Cleopatra’s Fortune Features: Five Bonus Levels, Free Spins, &amp; More</p>
<p>Cleopatra’s Fortune comes with a handful of features that are designed to elevate the experience and let you have a good time. The main feature here is a multi-tiered bonus level that has a progression bar that goes up to Level 5.</p>
<p>Free Spins Bonus Round: The 20 free spins will be triggered with the Bonus Symbol, and once you are in, you will have the opportunity to unlock new levels of the experience, from Level 1 to Level 5. As you progress, you will gain additional free spins, sticky reels, and multipliers, adding value to your gameplay as you go along.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Reign Over Egypt’s Wealth</p>

Apart from a highly thematic experience that shows on every level of design, the slot is also very rich in terms of overall reward value. There are five excellent bonus levels, a decent RTP, and gameplay that is ultimately very easy and intuitive.
