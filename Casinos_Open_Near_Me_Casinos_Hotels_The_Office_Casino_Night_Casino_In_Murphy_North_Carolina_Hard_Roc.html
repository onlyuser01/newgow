<p>Dabble hopes to surpass 1 million registered accounts in the USA by the end of June 2024</p>
<p>Dabble, a fresh Australian social betting platform, is already eyeing expansion in the USA. This announcement follows its recent foray into the region.</p>
<p>For reference, Dabble was founded in 2020 and offers a variety of socially-charged betting experiences to its fans. Its clients can follow other users, chat with friends and other bettors, comment on other players’ betting activity and even copy others’ bets.</p>
<p>Dabble mirrors many features that make social media platforms popular, allowing bettors to enjoy unparalleled experiences.</p>
<p>Dabble forayed into the US in October 2023, following its success in Australia. The main difference is that the US-oriented app offers daily fantasy sports instead of sports betting. Despite that, the company still offers the social features that have made it so popular in Australia.</p>
<p>Dabble Will Double Down on the US Market</p>
<p>The United States has always been a key market for Dabble since its launch. Dabble is currently available in 20 US states and boasts over 450,000 registered users. It is currently among the top 10 sports apps on the US App Store, competing directly with some of the biggest names in the world of sports betting and fantasy sports.</p>
<p>However, Dabble doesn’t plan to end its US expansion here. The company is now planning to double down on its operations in the country in hopes of surpassing 1 million registered accounts by the end of June 2024.</p>
<p>To that end, the company will bolster its offerings, introducing many new games and game modes. Free-to-play, peer-to-peer and sweepstakes are just some of the offerings coming to Dabble. In addition, the company plans to add more sports to its product lineup, allowing it to tap into an expanded audience of sports fans.</p>
<p>As of the time of this writing, Dabble offers fantasy sports offerings for the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, as well as for college football and basketball.</p>
<p>In addition to launching markets for more sports, Dabble is also eyeing launches in additional states. The company believes that it can earn daily fantasy sports licenses in additional 5-10 states. The company might also consider seeking sports betting licenses in some states, although it admitted that this would be a more expensive move.</p>
<p>Finally, the company plans to also diversify its payment options and introduce more and improved social features.</p>
