    <h1>Admiral Casino Biz Portland Casino Real Money No Deposit Casino Nj Casinos Casino Slots For Free Wil</h1>

<p>Hello, everyone,</p>
<p>The experience of our players is of utmost importance to us at Wild Tornado Casino. We try our best to provide them with all possible assistance and help.</p>
<p>In this case, the player’s main issue was the funds disappearing from the balance after wagering the bonus. The player was informed in chat that the funds got automatically subtracted as there is a maximum win from the free spins. Moreover, the customer support supervisor got in touch with the player to explain and clarify the reason of issue, as he had requested.</p>
<p>As for the bonus feature in the Wild Slot Ape, the player was also asked in chat for a screenshot as a proof or at least some details, however he did not provide the support team with any. We do not influence the in-game bonuses, it is totally on the side of the provider. We can transfer a request to the provider, however, we need certain details, like the exact time of the bet where an issue occured, a detailed explanation of the issue and a screenshot to prove it.</p>
<p>As for the availability of BTG for the player, sometimes providers restrict availability for play from certain countries, which we cannot influence, unfortunately. At that moment the team was not informed about the changes yet, therefore, such a confusion happened. We will make sure for such things not to happen in the future.</p>
<p>To sum up, the player’s claim that the bonus terms are misleading if that is what the player means is definitely false, as terms of the Welcome Bonus offer are clear: "the maximum winnings / profit from Free Spins, allowed for withdrawal, is limited to €100 or equivalent to another currency" (Source: https://www.wildtornado.com/bonus-terms). The amount that exceeds the maximum winnings limit is automatically subtracted by our system.</p>
<p>We're really sorry that the player’s first experience at our casino was frustrating. We will make sure that the provided feedback is taken into account, though.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Wild Tornado Casino team</p>
