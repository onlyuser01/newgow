    <h1>Red Wing Mn Casino Riverside Iowa Casino Closest Casinos Near Me River City Casino In St Louis Hotel</h1>

<p>AvatarUX is a promising developer of iGaming products and games. It has created memorable gameplay features such as PopWins and MultiPop and it is the author of dozens of unique experiences, including games such as CritterPop, CherryPopDeluxe, KokeshiPop, and so many others. To help reach as many players as possible, though, AvatarUX is making a smart pivot towards the North American market and it’s teaming up with Light &amp; Wonder to benefit from the latter’s own presence in the region.</p>
<p>Moving forward, AvatarUX games will be part of Light &amp; Wonder’s award-winning OpenGaming contentaggregation ecosystem, a powerful platform that has made it possible for companies to deliver their products quickly and reliably to the right operators in the North American market. AvatarUX will begin with eight titles that will be featured on OpenGaming and made available to markets globally, not just in North America.</p>
<p>AvatarUX has recently bagged the Rising Star award at the EGR B2B Awards, making it an important entity to watch for in the iGaming sector. AvatarUX is determined to continue growing its presence across new markets and delivering on its dedicated experiences that stand out thanks to the proprietary game features the company has been able to develop.</p>
<p>AvatarUX CEO Nicola Longmuir welcomed the opportunity to be adding Light &amp; Wonder to the company’s list of partners and talked about the significance of the deal in general. It was a delight to sign the important distribution deal with Light &amp; Wonder Longmuir explained.</p>
<p>"It is a real testament to the strides we’ve undertaken as a business in a short space of time, and we look forward to reaching and entertaining even more players through Light &amp; Wonder’s network," he said. Light &amp; Wonder Director of Partnerships Steve Mayes was similarly excited to see the company join. He said that the PopWins mechanic is something that has piqued his company’s interest and that could clearly add value to the OpenGaming ecosystem as such.</p>
<p>It's not just that, though. The new partnership also showcases Light &amp; Wonder’s clear commitment to adding new and promising studios that are committed to innovating the experience for everyone across the board. The games offered by AvatarUX are highly attractive and they will no doubt find success as part of OpenGaming. Light &amp; Wonder recently added Wazdan and PlayJeux to OpenGaming’s ecosystem.</p>
