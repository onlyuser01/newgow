<p>Kazuo Okada Indicted in Philippines for Fraud, Maintains Innocence</p>

<p>A court in the Philippines has ordered the arrest of Japanese casino mogul Kazuo Okada, 77, on three counts of fraud.</p>
<p>Kazuo Okada called the fraud allegations against him “absurd” and demanded to know how he could defraud companies that he owns. But his control of those companies is currently a matter of legal dispute. (Image: Reuters)</p>
<p>The charges relate to the alleged misappropriation of more than $3 million from Tiger Resorts — the operator of the Okada Manila, in the Philippines’ Entertainment City and come a month after the country’s Department of Justice recommended his indictment.</p>
<p>In an arrest warrant issued Friday and made public on Sunday, Judge Rolando How of the Paranaque City Regional Trial Court Branch 257 ordered law enforcement to present Okada to court.</p>
<p>Okada: ‘I Own Tiger Resorts’</p>
<p>Okada, who is a resident of Hong Kong, railed against the indictment to Inside Asian Gaming on Monday.</p>
<p>“How can I defraud the company that I own?” he demanded. “TRLEI is 100 percent controlled by Universal Entertainment Corporation, 67.9 percent… of which is controlled by Okada Holdings Limited (OHL). OHL is a corporation which I essentially own as I technically have control over all of OHL’s shares. OHL holds 100 percent of the shares of Tiger Resort Asia Limited (TRAL), which in turn, owns 99.99 percent of TRLEI.”</p>
<p>“As owner of Okada Manila, it is absolutely absurd for me to ‘unlawfully take’ these salaries and fees,” he continued. “I was responsible for the investment of more than US$2 billion in Okada Manila. How would I commit estafa (fraud) against TRLEI and Okada Manila for a measly amount of salaries when I was the one who established and caused the rise and success of Okada Manila?”</p>
<p>Dynastic Dispute</p>
<p>Okada, 76, was ousted from the board of Tiger Gaming’s parent, Universal Entertainment, in June 2017, from which he is accused of misappropriating a further $17 million in company funds.</p>
<p>Whether he does own 69 percent of Universal parent Okada Holdings is a matter of legal dispute. Okada Holdings is a family owned business whose board also ousted him in 2017 when family members turned against him.</p>
<p>Okada is suing his son and wife in an attempt to wrestle back control of the company.</p>
<p>The billionaire has also filed a motion for reconsideration with the DOJ, dismissing the accusations against him as baseless. He says he is the victim of a boardroom coup and that the disputed funds were legal director’s loans which he used to reinvest in junket operations for the Okada Manila.</p>
<p>Violence, Intimidation</p>
<p>But Universal — which Okada founded 50 years ago — claims that a third-party investigation into the matter has confirmed the allegations of fraud and the company has said it has “sincerely and solemnly” accepts this verdict.</p>
<p>The investigation also alleged Okada had “violently intimidated and threatened” a Universal executive, Yoshinao Negishi, with whom he is alleged to have conspired.</p>
<p>Okada made his fortune from the manufacture of pachinko machines in Japan and casino equipment for the international market. He was a founder and principal shareholder of Wynn Resorts before being ousted in 2012, allegedly — according to Steve Wynn — for bribing a Philippine official in a bid to receive licensing for the project that became the Okada Manila.</p>
