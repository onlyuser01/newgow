<p>Following two months of intense beta testing, VALORANT is finally coming live on June 2, with the game launching in six regions at first.</p>
<p>VALORANT Beta Ends on May 28 to Prepare for Official Launch</p>
<p>After a two-month closed beta, Riot Games fantasy shooter, VALORANT, is ready to launch officially on June 2 across the majority of planned regions worldwide. The company will kick off the game in North America, Brazil, Europe, South Korea, Japan and Oceania after testing extensively in the past two months.</p>
<p>With the beta now coming to a close, the closed beta will end on May 28, with all accounts being reset and Riot working on introducing some changes and quick patches ahead of VALORANT’s global launch.</p>
<p>Drops are ending, as are all purchases in the Closed Beta store. And… Closed Beta thereafter. Let’s talk about the end of the world and the welcoming of a new one — some basic things you need to know about the final days of the VALORANT Closed Beta: https://t.co/bI91UfjQ6b — VALORANT (@PlayVALORANT) May 22, 2020</p>
<p>Riot Games are also planning to bring a lot more to the table during the official launch, Anna Donlon, executive producer for VALORANT at Riot Games, confirmed. For starters, the game will feature a new map and a whole new armory of weapons. Here is what Donlon shared with the community ahead of the game’s roll-out.</p>
<p>“Our goal has always been to bring VALORANT to as much of the world as soon as possible, so we’re hyped to be able to do so on June 2. The team looks forward to starting our decades-long commitment to servicing the global VALORANT community. This is just the beginning of our journey together,” Donlon said.</p>
<p>Strong Player and Viewership Numbers for VALORANT</p>
<p>VALORANT has met all expectations in full, maintaining a healthy user base of over three million daily players, Donlon noted. On top of that, streaming numbers remained steady, with the game peaking at around 1.7 million viewers, and numbers taking a tumble as more players could access the game.</p>
<p>To meet demand, Riot Games has been deploying new servers on two continents, including Atlanta and Dallas in the United States, London in the United Kingdom, Madrid in Spain, and Warsaw in Poland.</p>

<p>Already, a number of top esports outfits have signed up competitive rosters, including Team SoloMid, Dignitas, Immortals, Cloud9, Team. Secret, and nearly all established franchises in the competitive esports world.</p>
<p>Ahead of the official launch of the game, Riot Games has already managed to suspend 1,600 suspected cheaters. Meanwhile, interest in the game has grown exponentially, seeing a spate of tournaments take place over the past two months.</p>
<p>Many of these tournaments were sponsored by the teams entering the game but others, such as ESPN and Twitch competitions have been a genuine effort to promote the game and help it bolster its profile within the community.</p>
<p>As Donlon said once before, VALORANT will be allowed to grow organically, and this growth will be expedited with the game’s official release on Tuesday, June 2.</p>
