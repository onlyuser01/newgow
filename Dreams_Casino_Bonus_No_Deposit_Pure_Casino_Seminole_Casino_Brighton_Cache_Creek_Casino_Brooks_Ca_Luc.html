<p>MGA Platforms by Campeón Get the Swintt Treatment</p>
<p>Apart from the classic games by Swintt, the companies have agreed to similarly roll out the SwinttLive catalog. This will offer players to experience the best of Swintt’s traditional games and its advanced Live Casino proposition. As to Campeón Gaming, the group has won multiple awards and distinctions, including the Best New Casino by AskGamblers Awards and the Best Casino Affiliate Program by iGB Affiliate Awards in 2018 and 2022 respectively.</p>
<p>The group’s Athens offices were named a Great Place To Work by its employees, testifying to the internal company culture that has made it possible for Campeón Gaming to become a truly successful iGaming giant. The new partnership will see the platform covered by 120 games.</p>
<p>Swintt, which launched in 2019, has been able to amass an impressive portfolio of titles that have become synonymous with iGaming. Some of them include Master of Books, Extra Win X, Aqua Lord, and more. There are excellent games such as Aloha Spirit XtraLock and Mystic Bear XtraHold which will both be featured as part of the Campeón Group experience. In addition, the company also created The Crown celebrity slot starring Vinnie Jones.</p>
<p>Commenting on the most recent partnership, Swintt CEO David Mann welcomed the opportunity to be bringing the company’s award-winning titles to a trusted gaming operator.</p>
<p>“By teaming up with Campeón Gaming, we’ve partnered with one of the industry’s leading platforms to ensure our games are seen by more customers at MGA-licensed casinos. We’re looking forward to working with them in the coming months in what promises to be a highly successful collaboration.” Swintt CEO David Mann</p>
<p>Campeón Excited about the Opportunity to Work with Swintt</p>
<p>Campeón Gaming Group CCO George Merodoulakis argued that the brand is one that prides itself on providing customers with the best possible quality of iGaming experiences and gaming products. Through this partnership with Swintt, Merodoulakis believes that Campeón has discovered the right partner which shares the Group’s own values.</p>
<p>He praised the addition of both the live and slot games and argued that thanks to this content tie-up, Campeón will continue to deliver excellent products to players that are playing on the Group’s Malta-licensed platforms.</p>
