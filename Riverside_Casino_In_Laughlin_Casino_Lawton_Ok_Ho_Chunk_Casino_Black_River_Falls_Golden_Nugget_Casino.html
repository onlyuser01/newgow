<p>Hit Game Fortnite’s VBucks Used for Widespread Dark Web Money Laundering</p>

<p>Fortnite Battle Royale has become an online cultural phenomenon. The free-to-play survival shooter garnered 125 million players within a year of its release, leading to concerns that its addictive qualities and use of in-game currency and loot-box microtransactions are introducing children and teenagers to the dynamics of gambling.</p>

<p>Now, a joint investigation by the UK’s Independent newspaper and cyber security firm Sixgill has revealed that criminals are using Fornite’s in-game currency, VBucks, as a tool to launder money on the dark web.</p>
<p>Thanks to the game’s mind-boggling popularity, fraudsters are buying VBucks using stolen credit card details, which can then be sold on the internet at knockdown prices to no shortage of customers.</p>
<p>Global Operations</p>
<p>Posing as potential buyers, Sixgill employees said they had uncovered fraudulent operations in Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, and English.</p>
<p>“Criminals are executing carding fraud and getting money in and out of the Fortnite system with relative impunity,” Benjamin Preminger, a senior intelligence analyst at Sixgill, told The Independent.</p>
<p>“Threat actors are scoffing at Epic Games’ weak security measures, saying that the company doesn’t seem to care about players defrauding the system and purchasing discounted V-bucks… This directly touches on the ability of threat actors to launder money through the game.”</p>
<p>Skin Gambling Scandal</p>
<p>Fortnite’s publisher Epic Games has been more careful about its controlling its in-game currency than some developers in recent years and has largely avoided the third-party skin gambling industry that surrounded games like CounterStrike: Global Offensive (CSGO) and FIFA.</p>
<p>In 2015, a multibillion dollar illegal gambling industry sprang up around CSGO and the trading of skins — collectable designer weapons obtained via loot boxes. The ability for skins to be transferred to third-party sites via a loophole in Steam’s OpenID API allowed them to be used for gambling.</p>
<p>Valve was slow to denounce the industry it had inadvertently created, leaving it open to claims that it was facilitating underage gambling. Lawsuits followed, forcing the company to act.</p>
<p>Account Closures</p>
<p>Fortnite contains no such loophole and, unlike CS:GO’s skins, the trading of VBucks is not permitted. Forums are full of players complaining their accounts have been closed by Epic because they bought VBucks from a third-party source or shared their account with a third party.</p>
<p>But according to Preminger, the developer is still not doing enough to prevent illicit behavior surrounding its game.</p>
<p>“Epic Games doesn’t seem to clamp down in any serious way on criminal activity surrounding Fortnite, money laundering or otherwise,” he told The Independent.</p>
<p>“While completely stopping such criminal activity is extremely difficult, several steps could be taken to mitigate the phenomenon, including monitoring the transfer of high-value goods in the game, identifying players with large stockpiles of V-bucks, and sharing data with relevant law enforcement agencies,” he added.</p>
