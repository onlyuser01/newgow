<p>Check out our Inter Miami vs. Orlando City prediction piece to learn about Leagues Cup odds and see our top picks for the August 2 game</p>
<p>Lionel Messi has played two games in the Inter Miami shirt, scoring three times, and helping his new team win two games in the group stage. In the first stage of the knockouts, the Herons are taking on their state rival, a team that‚Äôs been playing exciting soccer in the Leagues Cup.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs needless to say that we expect the Inter Miami vs. Orlando City game on Wednesday, August 2 to be exciting as well. The big question, however, is will Messi &amp; Co. continue to impress?</p>

<p>Inter Miami Looks Unstoppable With Messi on the Pitch</p>
<p>Lionel Messi made his Inter Miami debut in the first game of the Leagues Cup against Cruz Azul. He came on the field in the second half, and although we didn‚Äôt see too many magic moves from the GOAT, he did score the winner in the fourth minute of the stoppage time.</p>

<p>Then, in his second Inter Miami game, the Soccer Messiah was nothing short of brilliant. He scored twice against Atlanta United, while also recording one assist. He did all that in just 78 minutes, after which he asked the coach to sub him as he was feeling tired.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been over a week since then, and you can be certain that he‚Äôs had plenty of time to rest. That‚Äôs why we expect to see him in the starting XI on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Orlando City Would Love to Crush Its Rival‚Äôs Dreams</p>
<p>Orlando City is doing better than its state rival in the 2023 MLS, but the history between these two shows that they‚Äôre not too different. In fact, each team tends to do better at home than on the road. This explains why Orlando City has three losses and two wins against Inter Miami in games played in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>The last time they met at DRV PNK Stadium, however, the visitors won. Actually, Orlando City destroyed Inter Miami 3-1. It happened in May, when Phil Neville was still in charge of the Herons. However, a lot has changed since.</p>
<p>With Gerardo Martino in the dugout, and Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets on the pitch, Inter Miami is way better than it was in May. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean Orlando City players will be waving a white flag on August 2. On the contrary, they‚Äôre probably very eager to give all they‚Äôve got.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Orlando City Prediction</p>
<p>Orlando City‚Äôs defense has been this team‚Äôs Achilles heel this season. These guys are probably aware of it, knowing that there‚Äôs little chance they‚Äôll be able to keep a clean sheet against Messi &amp; Co. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôll probably try to fight back and score some goals on their own.</p>
<p>This is why over 3 goals looks certain, as well as both teams to score (BTS). When it comes to the match-winner market, it‚Äôs only logical to back Inter Miami.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Miami to win &amp; over 3 goals</p>
