<p>Jacksonville Jaguars (#4) are going to Arrowhead Stadium next Saturday to take on the Kansas City Chiefs (#1) in an AFC Divisional Round game</p>
<p>After beating the favored Los Angeles Chargers in the Wild Card round by just one point, the Jacksonville Jaguars are now praying for another miracle. If they beat the No. 1 Super Bowl favorites – the Kansas City Chiefs – this coming Saturday, they’re going to advance to the AFC Championship for the first time in the 21st century. So, can they pull it off?</p>

<p>Jacksonville Jaguars Never Give Up</p>
<p>Confidence is sky-high in the JAX locker room. These guys are 6-0 in their last six, with their most recent win being the one against the Chargers in the Wild Card round. The game saw a superb comeback by Doug Pederson’s boys who were 27-0 down at one point in the second quarter.</p>

<p>However, their quarterback Trevor Lawrence then went into beast mode. From the last minute of the first half to the end of the game, he threw for four touchdowns, while also scoring a two-point conversion on his own.</p>
<p>Finally, in the last drive of the game, he did just enough to bring the ball into a field-goal zone, so it wasn’t difficult for Riley Patterson to score the game-winning three-pointer.</p>
<p>It was a historic comeback for the Florida-based franchise, which taught them a lesson that they should never give up. However, the push in the Wild Card game has probably exhausted them both physically and mentally. It’s a big question of whether they can put on a similar kind of performance at packed Arrowhead Stadium.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs Dreaming Big</p>
<p>The Chiefs want to win the Super Bowl and they have no intention of letting the Jaguars ruin their plan. They’ve had plenty of time to prepare for the Divisional Round game, given the fact that they had a bye in the first round of playoffs after finishing top of the AFC standings.</p>
<p>They were brilliant in the regular season, finishing with a record of 14-3. What’s interesting is that only one of those three losses happened at Arrowhead – the Buffalo Bills beat them by just four points in Round 6.</p>
<p>Since then, the Chiefs are 10-1, with their only loss happening to the Cincinnati Bengals on the road. Once again, it was a loss by a tiny margin – the Bengals won 27-24.</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars vs Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are nine-point favorites for a reason. They got a much better roster than the Jaguars, not to mention that they’re in a much better shape physically – they didn’t have to play an exhausting Wild card game as the Jags.</p>
<p>Plus, the Jaguars vs Chiefs Divisional game is played in Kansas City, where these guys are always phenomenal. They’re 4-0 in the previous four Jags vs Chiefs games and we’re almost 100% sure they’re going to win again.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
