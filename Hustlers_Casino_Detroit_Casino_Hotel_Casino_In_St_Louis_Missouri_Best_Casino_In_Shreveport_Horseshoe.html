    <h1>Hustlers Casino Detroit Casino Hotel Casino In St Louis Missouri Best Casino In Shreveport Horseshoe</h1>

<p>Justspin Casino banned my account and confiscated my money.</p>
<p>I have been playing at PB group quite a lot. The promotions were good and the sites seemed trustworthy. On 11.3 I noticed the withdraw page was turned into "You haven't identified yourself yet, please make a trustworthy deposit". I made some deposits and continued playing, but the page didn't change. The sites PB sites seem to be very connected so I asked the 21.com customer support about that and they told me there shouldn't be any problems and I can continue playing. I made some more deposits.</p>
<p>Then 14th of march I got an email from 21.com:</p>

<p>So they banned me and confiscated the money I had on my Justspin account. That money left on the account was money I had deposited and played with, so no bonus money or bonus win money there. I didn't break any promotion rules. I played the allowed games, didn't bet more than â‚¬5 per round etc. Now it looks like some of the games I used to play are not playable with bonus money but when I played them they weren't.</p>
<p>The terms 17 and 20 are very vague so I don't know why they banned me and they refuse to tell me. They don't answer my emails anymore.</p>
<p>They just gave me bigger and bigger deposit bonuses before confiscating the money. Can you please look into it? Thanks!</p>
