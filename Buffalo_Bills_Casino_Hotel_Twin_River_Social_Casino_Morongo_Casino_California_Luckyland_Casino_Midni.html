<p>International Game Technology PLC (IGT) has recently announced a new, exclusive multi-year licensing deal with WWE. The partnership will allow them to create and distribute omnichannel lotto games under the WWE brand, along with end-to-end advertising solutions.</p>
<p>IGT Eager to Blend Its Lottery Expertise with the Valuable WWE Assets</p>
<p>IGT chief operating officer Jay Gendron recognized WWE’s ability to reach a plethora of clients and players belonging to different demographics, cultures, and age groups. The company is eager to combine its own expertise in the lottery industry with WWE’s one-of-a-kind assets to create top-tier lotto games and second-chance advertising solutions opportunities. These solutions would address the needs of their international players and customers, and they would include a series of advertising materials featuring Superstars, logos, and different types of events.</p>
<p>As one of the leaders in the lottery and gaming fields, IGT aims to constantly expand its global presence and find new ways to offer its intellectual property and lottery games to even more fans. WWE’s vice president referred to the new licensing agreement as “an exciting opportunity” to accomplish this. The company aims to take full advantage of the powerful crossover between the already successful WWE Universe and a different side of the gaming landscape.</p>
<p>How Global Entertainment Will Benefit From the New Partnership</p>
<p>IGT has already been supplying its highly entertaining gaming experiences to a rich array of channels and regulated markets, including Digital, Sports Betting, Lottery, and Gaming Machines. Last December, IGT has expanded its collaboration with Sightline Payments as a means of adding its successful mobile loyalty platform to its customer experience.</p>
<p>The IGT team will continue to offer its top-quality products following a strict responsible gaming policy while leveraging even more compelling content and investing in more innovative, cutting-edge technologies as a result of the new deal. Together with WWE, they will create and offer the most engaging, unrivaled experiences to passionate players that will help them grow at a faster pace.</p>
<p>IGT’s powerful local presence and close ties with state governments and market regulators in over 100 countries worldwide is maintained with the help of over 11,000 talented employees. Together with the equally skilled staff of another leader in the global entertainment industry, WWE, the company is getting ready to deliver its content to even more global customers. The company’s Q3 numbers in 2021 showed that IGT reached an impressive double-digit growth throughout all of its business divisions.</p>
<p>WWE is a media organization with an impressive portfolio of businesses that create and supply original, family-friendly content via pay-per-view and TV programs, publishing sites, and digital media channels. Their programs reach over 900 million households spread all across the planet, and they are available in 28 languages. Their content is distributed with the help of highly reputable partners such as FOX Sports, NBCUniversal, Sony India, BT Sport, and Rogers. The WWE Network also features a huge library with videos on demand, live pay-per-view options, and scheduled programs that can be accessed by people in 180+ countries.</p>
