    <h1>The Palace Casino Sweep Slots Casino Login Bay Mills Resort And Casino Nolimits Casino Online Bitcoi</h1>

<p>Solcasino.io, is attached to their nft collection solcasino (https://www.tensor.trade/trade/solcasino). Apart of this NFT is that you can lock it in their website (solcasino.io) and receive a token ($SCS) that you can then stake to earn USD. Paid from the revenue the casino makes.</p>
<p>I own 4 of these nfts, currently valued at 45 SOL apiece (180 SOL, $3400 USD) and they are locked in the site.</p>
<p>There is an option in solcasino.io that allows you to self exclude your connected web3 wallet to help with gambling addictions. Trying to be responsible, I set a self exclusion period to "forever", locking my wallet out of the website indefinitely. When going to set this self exclusion period, there was no warning about our NFT's being included in the exclusion, just that we needed to withdraw our actual money. There was no obvious indicator this would permanently lock my web3 wallet out from the site.</p>
<p>So now, when trying to be responsible and stop gambling, I end up being punished with my NFT's valued at $3400 USD being gone forever.</p>
<p>I contacted the casino when this happened back in early May,</p>
<p>they said that it would be complicated but they could assure with their word they would be able to fix it. I patiently waited, and never heard form them. I opened several more support tickets only for them all to be closed with little or no response at all.</p>
<p>Finally, 6 weeks later on June 19th. Only after bringing attention to the issue publicly in the discord (which I did end up being muted a week for) I got word from the team that the issue would never be resolved and my nfts were essentially flushed down the drain.</p>
<p>I'm not asking for them to change the core contract, nor am I asking them to break my self exclusion period. I am simply asking them to reimburse the value of said NFTs, as I dont believe the self exclusion period should be allowed to hold assets locked in the site. At the time of the self exclusion I wasn't even able to withdraw them to due to a time lock.</p>
<p>If I staying at a hotel with a casino and did something to get myself banned, I would be allowed to retrieve all my property. Again, not asking them to change anything about the casino's core contract, just asking for a refund due to the fact they are holding $3400 USD worth of assets, and for lack of clarity on exclusion terms.</p>
