<p>The new collaboration further complements Allwyn's commitment to good causes and is expected to raise invaluable funding for research of spinal cord injuries</p>
<p>The leading lottery operator, Allwyn, announced Monday a new global partnership with the Wings for Life World Run. The Wings for Life World Run is an international annual running event that contributes to raising funds for research, as well as clinical studies that seek to develop a cure for injuries of the spinal cord. Thanks to the terms of the new collaboration, Allwyn was designated as an official global partner of the Wings for Life World Runs for the next three years.</p>
<p>Nearly a decade ago, back in 2014, the Wings of Life World Run was established. Since then, the annual event has contributed 100% of its donations and entry fees to clinical studies and scientific research into spinal cord injuries.</p>
<p>The event has seen more than 1 million people participate from 195 countries since it was established. This helped raise €38.3 million ($40.4 million), which helped spinal cord research. Last year’s edition of the Wings for Life World Run helped raise €4.7 million ($5 million) and saw 161,892 people from 192 different nationalities participate.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to welcome Allwyn to the Wings for Life World Run as a global partner.“ Anita Gerhardter, CEO of Wings for Life</p>
<p>Wings for Life’s CEO, Anita Gerhardter, said that the organization is excited to team up with Allwyn and see the company become a global partner of the event. According to her, the new partnership will have a positive impact and will help raise funds that can ultimately help many people around the world. Finally, Gerhardter said: “Personally, I like their slogan “where we all win,” because it expresses exactly what the Wings for Life World Run stands for.”</p>
<p>The Company Reaffirms Commitment to Supporting Good Causes</p>
<p>Allwyn’s chief global brand and CSR officer, Pavel Turek, said that the support of good causes is a part of the company’s top priorities. Moreover, he explained that Allwyn is excited to join forces with the Wings for Life World Run in the UK, Austria, Czech Republic, Cyprus and Greece. Turek deemed the event a “fantastic cause” and pointed out that everyone can participate, whether young or old, fit or wheelchaired.</p>
<p>“At Allwyn, supporting good causes is central to what we do.“ Pavel Turek, chief global brand and CSR officer at Allwyn</p>
<p>Teaming up with the Wings for Life World Run, employees of Allwyn and its subsidiaries will be encouraged to raise funds for the event. This new collaboration complements further the company’s commitment to good causes. In fact, back in 2021, Allwyn, along with its subsidiaries, helped with more than €32 million ($33.8 million) to good causes.</p>
