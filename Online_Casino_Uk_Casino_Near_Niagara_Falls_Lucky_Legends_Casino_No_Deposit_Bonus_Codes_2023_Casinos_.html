    <h1>Online Casino Uk Casino Near Niagara Falls Lucky Legends Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Casinos</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I deposited over 20,000 in 3 weeks at Casinoly. Until I found out that it is a scam casino.</p>
<p>Exceptionally, I won €2,000 after I deposited €15,000. Although I never received a bonus, I never received any winnings. There was also no confirmation email.</p>
<p>Apparently, when you deposit money, you have to ask for the bonus in live chat. However, they don't know how to book it themselves. Nobody speaks German anyway. But when I asked for a deposit bonus, there were always some excuses, we weren't allowed to play before the bonus was posted, etc. The next time you do everything as instructed, you won't get the bonus anyway.</p>
<p>But the worst I've experienced. I played Dragon Luck with a stake of 2 euros. I have often received playout. The winnings were around 300-1,000 euros in the bonus rounds.</p>
<p>Then, after winning another 7-spin lead, I was kicked out of the game. After that I had to log in again and restart the game. Suddenly the plays were gone. Got it on screenshot. Because after that it happened again. And that 4 times.</p>
<p>Every time I restarted the game I got different error messages.</p>
<p>At some point the game worked again, when I asked for a live chat with a waiting time of more than 30 minutes, I got an automated answer in English. Nobody speaks German there.</p>
<p>After that I sent several emails for a week.</p>
<p>I had to answer the same questions over and over again.</p>
<p>Although visible in the screenshot, I was supposed to answer the time, stake, current account balance, etc. 6 or 7 times in a week.</p>
<p>Eventually an answer came with a solution. I would have already received 10 free spins for this.</p>
<p>The free spins were simple spins with a 10p bet.</p>
<p>No bonus round.</p>
<p>Although I missed 7 bonus rounds with a bet of 2 euros, I was booked 10 free spins with a bet of 10 cents.</p>
<p>The problem is that they can track it exactly. Nevertheless, they didn't want to know anything about bonus rounds with a stake of 2 euros.</p>
<p>The answers are mostly in English and automated. They don't have a phone number.</p>
<p>After other online players told similar cases, it was finally clear to me that it was not an online casino, but an online mafia.</p>
<p>Even if you google a bit, you will find that it is always the same scam.</p>
<p>Lost over 20,000 in 3 weeks. But when it comes to paying out, they use all means to trick. Never got a bonus either. Nevertheless, they invent any stories in order not to have to pay out.</p>
<p>It is incomprehensible to me that such fraudsters are "allowed" to operate online casinos in Germany.</p>
<p>Because of me, my buddies also played at Casinoly.</p>
<p>Nobody has ever won anything.</p>
<p>After I then wanted to delete my account, I immediately received a 300 euro bonus amount.</p>
<p>But it was gone after 15 minutes anyway. I would not have received a payment for it anyway.</p>
<p>So people stay away from such scammers online casinos. If you play, then google for experience reports beforehand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't realize it until afterwards when it was already too late.</p>
<p>If you play, then inquire beforehand whether it is a reputable site. They don't have a phone number. Probably only one person speaks German, but he also only writes any automated answers.</p>
<p>I just want to warn you guys about this casino.</p>
<p>I have no idea how they manage to run an online casino here.</p>
<p>But with rights digging that does not work at Casinoly.</p>
<p>I wish you a lot of fun and luck while playing.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
