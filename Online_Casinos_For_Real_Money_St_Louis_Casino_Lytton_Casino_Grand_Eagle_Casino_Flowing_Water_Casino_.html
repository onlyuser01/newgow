    <h1>Online Casinos For Real Money St Louis Casino Lytton Casino Grand Eagle Casino Flowing Water Casino</h1>

<p>I tried to email jacks pay 7 times and it’s not going thru because they blocked now they are changing there thread as we speak on there texting and I can’t submit anything does anyone have a physical address</p>
<p>and a name I’m trying to print and mail but they are changing there whole process how come they haven’t done this with everyone else who has negative comments about them ? Now they are going to say that I abused the bonus or promo policy can you show me where I did do that ? And please show me the two IP addresses your claiming you blocked me for and who are the names of these people that I asked to do things for me ? I did find three other people that have my phone number and they are going to be submitting complaints as well here but they are first going to prove to casino guru that they didn’t know me at all and that Jackspay did the same exact thing to them and they do t want you to be able to claim your the victim and you took a lot more money then you lied to me about but they the three people who are going to file complaints with want to do it thru an attorney and they want me to be part of there complaint because they have reading everything that I have been trying to say and you keep lying and they refuse to do it with this format so I am going to continue to go forward with my complaint and I’m also going to become a part of there complaint as well with the attorney that they plan on using</p>
<p>so I’m would like the $1800 in Bitcoin you owe me and your name and address so I can mail you my own documentation if you don’t provide it they said something about the attorney is going to subpoena you and that damages will be in the 7 figures all I want from you is to provide proof of what I did for you to steal my $1800 and for you to block me off of your site these other people say that your doing the same thing over and over and they are afraid to come out to casino guru because with your rating they say you shouldn’t be allowed to do it anymore when does this game of yours end and when and why haven’t you shown one ounce of proof that you haven’t done anything wrong why does Jackspay not have to give anybody a player someone with a customer service issue that no player can ever complain because they never get the name of the person from Jackspay who keeps making up things and you say that wasn’t you they asked me to ask you how many people are I your customer service dept ? And what is your name ? Oh boy I just received two more emails now who want to be apart of this the complaint against you but they are intimidated because you haven’t provided anything on my situation and how did Jackspay get a 3.7 rating I don’t think I’ve seen one lower why don’t you explain that and how come nobody is coming out in this forum to defend you? These people say they are afraid and intimidated by you because you do t provide any name or anything period you lie then lie again and lie again I am going to the police because my wife is now concerned for her safety because we don’t know who you are and what your address is and you just block anything or any account and you keep the money and then you decide who you are going to pay out so it looks like you arent cheating everyone when I’m fact over time you wind up cheating everyone as f I don’t know why casino guru puts up with all your cheating I mean do they have to let you be a part of this forum until you have a zero rating and then you say my poor wife threatened you ? Everyone going forward is going to take you on privately in on big case to close you down everything on this forum negative about Jackspay is here but going forward it’s not however I’m goi g to finish my complaint as on as I figure out how to do it and then I’m moving on to the private matter because not only did you not pay me you refuse to answer one question out of the 10</p>
<p>i left you so I’m going to finish and then we deal privately you just won’t ever admit that you are a money stealing poor victim and we are all picking on Jackspay poor thing hey everyone else want the name of who we can make complaints out too ! Jackspay gets special treat because when gets to hide behind the curtain like the wizard of oz I will get a name address everything no matter what the cost and tbe attorney fees are already going to be covered under a policy they have thru arag insurance we will see look for my complaint Jackspay then I’ll I can call my friends and say sign. Up for Jackspay because I’ve.been kicked off for no other reason then losing 15k -20k I. A few months and this is. What I get ? Good bye you nameless bully leave my wife alone she doing her case not on this forum neither will anybody else from what I’m hearing we will take it offline because everything favors you and then you want every single negative feed about.jacks pay removed how big is you r house with the money you take from us? Good bye forum reach me with at the private email this is ridiculous I’ll finish my complaint now and bye</p>
