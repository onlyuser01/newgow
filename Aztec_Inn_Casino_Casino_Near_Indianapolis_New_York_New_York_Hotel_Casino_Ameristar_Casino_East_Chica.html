    <h1>Aztec Inn Casino Casino Near Indianapolis New York New York Hotel Casino Ameristar Casino East Chica</h1>

<p>Hi, all my accounts were recently banned by the presser group, and they refuse to return my balance to my bank account. I received an email stating that I had broken some rules and they were gonna close all my accounts and hold all my funds. I played on casino games with bonus money and fs offers and with my own money on 8 of their Casinos (RapidCasino.com, 21.com, NeonVegas.com, UltraCasino.com, JustSpin.com, NitroCasino.com, CasinoFest.com, XLBet.com)</p>
<p>they have frozen at least 23000e of my funds. I tried communicating with them after the email I received, but it's going nowhere. they refuse to answer what rules I presumably broke, or answering if they are going to return my money.</p>
<p>i will attach the email they sent me, it's in finnish, my native language, hope it's not a problem:</p>
<p>Anni from Customer Service</p>
