<p>Hello Kristina!</p>
<p>They sent me an email showing my winnings of $692.84 was approved. I then sent a photo copy of my Driver License and Banking information via email to collect my winnings of $692.84 as per their request. Juicy Casino replied back, $692.84 was reversed due to beneficiary account details incomplete. I chated with Juicy Casino customer service and asked why my winnings of $692.84 was reversed. Juicy Casino employee told me my banking information was not accuarate. Juicy Casino employee told me to fill out the withdrawl from their website again with correct banking information. I proceeded to call my bank and verify my banking information and requested another payout with my winnings of $692.84. I was keeping on eye on my payout through Juicy Casino website and noticed my winnings went from $692.84 to $200. I chated with customer service to find out why my winnings went to $200 on the web. The Juicy Casino employee told me the max cash out is $200. I don't understand why I got an email showing approved for $692.84 when it was denied later on. Also, why didn't the Juicy Casino team member tell me their was a max cash out of $200 when I asked why my winnings of $692.84 was denied. Juicy Casino employee told me to send correct banking information with another withdrawl request. She never mentioned their was a max cash out of $200.</p>
<p>I Attempted to withdrawl my max cash out winnings of $200 and got another email stating my banking information is incorrect. My banking information is correct, I've been getting the run around and Ive been scammed. I did not earn any winnings from a bonus. I sent guru emails with communication from Juicy Guru and I when filed my my complaint. I will fwrd the emails to you. Thank you!</p>
