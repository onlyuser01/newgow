<p>The gambling industry representative body in the US, American Gaming Association (AGA), announced today its Board of Directors elected Jim Allen to succeed Trevor Croker as Chairman of the association.</p>
<p>Croker’s Worthy Successor</p>
<p>Jim Allen, Chairman of Hard Rock International and CEO of Seminole Gaming, will be replacing Aristocrat Technologies CEO and Managing Director Trevor Croker starting January 2022, when his two-year term is set to expire. Croker has been serving as Chairman of AGA since January 2020.</p>
<p>“Jim brings decades of experience in commercial casino operations and tribal gaming—a perspective that will be invaluable as we work to set the industry’s agenda, accelerate gaming’s comeback and strengthen our value to communities across the country,” said AGA President and CEO Bill Miller, who has had his contract recently extended for an additional 3 years by the association’s executive committee.</p>
<p>Jim Allen, who has been leading operations of the Seminole Tribe across gaming, hospitality, and entertainment for 20 years and was instrumental for the Florida Tribe’s business expansion in the state and nationwide, was appointed to AGA’s Board of Directors in 2015 to help drive the association’s priorities by leveraging his leadership skills and experience.</p>
<p>“This is a pivotal juncture for the gaming industry and I’m honored to serve as the AGA’s next chairman. The AGA has played an essential role in uniting the industry throughout the pandemic, and I’m thankful to Trevor and the AGA board of directors for entrusting me to help lead the industry’s continued recovery.” Jim Allen, Next Chairman, AGA</p>
<p>On the Path of Industry Recovery</p>
<p>Soon-to-be stepping down Trevor Croker expressed his “utmost confidence” that the association led by Jim Allen and Bill Miller “will continue to lead the gaming industry” along the path of industry recovery, a process which started during his term and that he is proud to take part in.</p>
<p>“Trevor has been a tremendous chairman of the AGA and trusted advisor to me over the past two years, guiding the industry through the most challenging time in its history. The AGA and entire gaming community are indebted to his service to the industry.” Bill Miller, President and CEO, AGA</p>
<p>Miller and Croker were instrumental for the recovery of the industry in the aftermath of the coronavirus impact, achieving a historic inclusion of gaming in the $2.2 trillion economic stimulus package Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided by the federal government to affected businesses.</p>
<p>Other recent achievements of the pair include an expansion of the efforts towards establishing safer gambling, including AGA’s ‘Have a Game Plan. Bet Responsibly’ campaign, as well as making sure the voice of the industry is heard by building gaming champions on Capitol Hill.</p>
