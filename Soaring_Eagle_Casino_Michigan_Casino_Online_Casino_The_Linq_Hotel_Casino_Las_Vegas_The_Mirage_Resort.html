    <h1>Soaring Eagle Casino Michigan Casino Online Casino The Linq Hotel Casino Las Vegas The Mirage Resort</h1>

<p>Dear Niklas,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your delayed withdrawal.</p>
<p>Please understand, that a variety and accessibility of payment methods are not managed by the casino exclusively. Several factors as the Licensing Authority, geolocation, and contracts with the payment providers and bank restrictions, all have a major influence. If a payment method was available for deposits it doesn’t mean necessary, that it will be offered for withdrawals too.</p>
<p>Could you please advise which payment method has been used to deposit funds into your account? Do I understand correctly that your payment is still pending inside the account without being processed? Could you please specify how many days ago was your withdrawal requested?</p>
<p>It’s quite usual for withdrawals to take a couple of days or even weeks to get fully processed. This means that it may take some time before your money appears in your account. Assuming that you have completed KYC verification successfully and had your withdrawal approved, I truly believe it’s only a matter of time before you’ll receive it.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
