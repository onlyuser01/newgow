<p>Rootz is happy to be an early adopter and believes that the integration will allow it to remain ahead of the game</p>
<p>Octoplay, a developer with a burning passion for slot games, has signed a new content partnership with Rootz. Under the agreement, the latter company has become the provider’s latest casino partner.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, Rootz has spiced up the portfolio of its brands with games developed by Octoplay. As a result, players of Wildz, Spinz, Caxino, Wheelz and Chipz will get to experience the best titles the studio has to offer.</p>
<p>As of the time of this writing, Rootz’s brands have been supplied with hot games such as Pearly Shores, Heavy Anchor, Hot Harvest, Disco Drive and Blazing Touch. According to the announcement, many more games will be added at a later date.</p>
<p>Rootz is licensed in Malta, Germany and Ontario and will help Octoplay’s titles reach many more fans. Octoplay, meanwhile, has been steadily expanding its presence in Europe, securing licenses in the United Kingdom, Malta, Romania and, most recently, Sweden.</p>
<p>The developer, founded by the former Red Tiger and Evolution Gaming executive Carl Ejlertsson, remains committed to offering thrilling slots to operators all over the world.</p>
<p>Rootz Is Happy to Be an “Early Adopter”</p>
<p>Speaking of Carl Ejlertsson, the CEO voiced his thoughts on the new deal, saying that his team is very proud to have joined forces with Rootz. Ejlertsson applauded Rootz for its commitment to delivering entertaining casino experiences in Europe and beyond – a value that the operator shares with Octoplay.</p>
<p>The partnership with Rootz provides our market-leading games to thousands of new players, enabling them to enjoy the pulse-racing experience they have been designed to provide from the first spin to the last. Carl Ejlertsson, CEO, Octoplay</p>
<p>Ejlertsson concluded that the new integration attests to the growing popularity of Octoplay’s content.</p>
<p>Rootz’s chief commercial officer Sam Brown also commented on the matter, praising Octoplay’s Dream Team which is taking the online casino market by storm with its titles. Brown said that the operator is happy to have the opportunity to be one of the early adopters of the supplier’s games.</p>
<p>Being ahead of the game again with this fantastic new content is a testament to the quality of the teams and technology at both Octoplay and Rootz. Sam Brown, CCO, Rootz</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2023, Octoplay launched a second studio to support its production pace and keep up with the increasing demand for its content. The developer’s games have been sought by many major operators and suppliers, including Soft2Bet, which adopted Octoplay’s portfolio in February.</p>
