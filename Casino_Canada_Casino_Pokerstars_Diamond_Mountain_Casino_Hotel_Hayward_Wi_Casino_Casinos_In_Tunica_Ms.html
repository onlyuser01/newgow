<p>Travel Back to the Cretaceous</p>
<p>It’s time to travel back in history and go back to the Cretaceous, a time before man when chaos ruled the world and the mighty dinosaurs ruled the emerging mountains and massive forests. In this land roamed by titans, Raging Rex is actively hunting its prey. While engaged in the base game, players are given the chance to unlock a Free Spins round with the help of at least three and up to six scatter symbols.</p>
<p>This will open up the opportunity to choose one of the three special Free Spins bonuses available: Feeding Frenzy, Survival, and Hatchling Mania.</p>
<p>Feeding Frenzy – here, Raging Rex’s prey will be randomly chosen from the four dinosaur symbols that will be seen at the beginning of the round. The Raging Rex will begin to stomp across the reels, making the Frenzy Meter go up whenever the targeted prey lands on the reels.</p>
<p>Landing three to six scatters here will bring players seven, nine, 11, or 13 free spins. Two to five additional free spins are available when landing two to five scatters.</p>
<p>Survival mode – players will rely on the popular Hold and Win mechanic and benefit from a one-of-a-kind bonus game. The mode is played on 12 separate reels surrounding a 2×2 Rex collector symbol. The goal is for players to stay in their positions for as long as possible and hold on to the three lives they will be given while continuing to scoop up wins via the Rex collector.</p>
<p>The round comes to an end when players record three consecutive losses. The wins automatically reset players’ lives to the original number of three. Survival mode also features an additional added bonus: when at least six symbol wins are accumulated, the value of each of these symbols goes up by the original value of the respective symbols.</p>
<p>Hatchling Mania – players who select this option and land between three and six scatters receive seven to 13 free spins. One to five extra free spins can be received when landing two to six scatters. While engaged in this round, the Rex symbol will not be seen landing. Instead, every hatchling seen landing on the reels will turn into a sticky one, staying in place while engaged in the bonus game and moving during the spins.</p>
<p>The sticky hatchlings can land with 2x and 3x multipliers that will be multiplied by each other when several of them are part of the same win before being applied to the respective win.</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s games ambassador, Magnus Wallentin, spoke about the “new thrilling features” added to the sequel while expressing eagerness to see players’ reactions at the sight of the new slot.</p>
<p>Similarly, last month, the studio continued its popular Dead series with the Scales of Dead sequel, a fresh 5×3 slot with a 20,000x max win, following July’s launch of Merlin: Journey of Flame, the fifth installment in the Merlin series.</p>
