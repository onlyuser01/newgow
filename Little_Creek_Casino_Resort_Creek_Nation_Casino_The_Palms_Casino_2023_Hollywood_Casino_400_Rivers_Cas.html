    <h1>Little Creek Casino Resort Creek Nation Casino The Palms Casino 2023 Hollywood Casino 400 Rivers Cas</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I want to note that I have accumulated sports betting losses, not winnings. Yes, I have played in sports section and had $3078 worth of approved withdrawals, I have provided a picture of the withdrawals above, I will re-attach it. I think this withdrawal amount is large enough to trigger a check, and I was successfully paid accordingly, which means no issues were found with my account. I also want to add that at the time of the $3078 withdrawal I have been behind before on sports betting, my account problem only happens after my account goes into roulette winnings. Interesting how no problem was found with my account before this, given that I even forwarded a communication to your colleague Thomas's email in which my first withdrawal of $3078 was declined, and I am contacting a sportsbet.io employee asking if I have a problem with the account because my withdrawal was denied and he assured me that there is no problem with my account and my withdrawal was stopped because I logged in from a new IP and they stopped it so that I the money was stolen so I claimed it again and sportsbet support approved it. This in itself means that my account did not have a problem, and it is documented in my communication with them, where they assure me by email that there is no problem with my account. You can check it, it has already been forwarded to you. I am attaching pictures of the withdrawal from both the site and my wallet where it was received. I also expect evidence of this non-existent issue from the site. If you need it, I will send you the communication with the site again, in which it is written in black and white that there is no problem with my account.</p>
