    <h1>Silver Oak Casino Scrooge Casino Peppermill Resort Spa Casino South Virginia Street Reno Nv Pulsz Bi</h1>

<p>Hello, I registered an account in this casino in November 2021. During the whole period of active play I contributed more than half a million hryvnias, withdrew less than 100,000, the return was terrible, more than 2,500 bonus games were bought in Pragmatic Play slots maximum win x500, in other slots total the amount of turnover is about 2,000,000 hryvnias, of which I have never seen at least x1,000, made more than 25,000 turns at different rates in jackpot slots, did not give even a minimum jackpot, although at least 200-300 players a day receive in these jackpot slots. Of the casino promotions such as the "miracle wheel" or the "win wheel", there was never a cash prize of only 10 and 20 free spins, although he had more than 3,000 attempts! To all the complaints to the casino administration, I heard only the answer "good luck another time." Sorry, but this is absurd when a person plays for more than six months and does not see even 50% return! For 500,000 deposits, I have never won 100,000, so my maximum win on this resource is a maximum of 12,000. I come to the logical conclusion that the casino administration has a direct impact on the return on each account, as the client can not always be in the red, sooner or later after such losses should be in return, but not for six months to wait for it. Do I need to contribute another million to win at least 50,000 ???</p>
