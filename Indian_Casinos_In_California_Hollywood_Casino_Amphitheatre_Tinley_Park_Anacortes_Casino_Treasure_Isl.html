    <h1>Indian Casinos In California Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Tinley Park Anacortes Casino Treasure Isl</h1>

<p>I have played a few times in the casino, unfortunately without success. I was luckier in my last game and I finally won. Then the casino requested my ID and I uploaded it to the casino. Then they wanted a selfie with the note with the date on it and the casino page in the background. I submitted that and received an email that my account was verified. I wanted to withdraw my money right away, but that didn't work. Casino informed me that my account is being checked by the security department. The casino later requested a video call. I had a lot on my mind at the time and really didn't have time and when I finally wanted to make the call, the casino closed my account. Casino refers to paragraph 32.2. On the aplayslots.de page there are only 17 points for the general terms and conditions. I asked about the paragraph and Casino sent it to me:</p>
<p>"32.2. Aplay reserves the right to refuse to return any funds or reverse transaction until the user's identity is verified and the payment method for which the refund has been requested have been verified. You agree that, for purposes of such verification, Aplay may request proper identification and / or proof of ownership of the payment method that was used for the deposit. If the documents are not provided by the user within five (5) days from the date of the request, we reserve the right to close the account and withhold the funds that were in the gaming account. "</p>
<p>But I submitted my documents and Casino verified my account. So I don't understand why the casino closed my account. I was ready to make the call, but they refused to activate my account.</p>
