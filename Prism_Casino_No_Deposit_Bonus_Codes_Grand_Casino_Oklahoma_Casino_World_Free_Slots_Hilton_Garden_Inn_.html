<p>The Far East Consortium, which owns Palasino’s parent company, is excited to launch iGaming from Malta with an MGA license</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) has signed a new platform deal with Palasino Malta, a subsidiary of Trans World Hotels &amp; Entertainment. This deal follows a head-of-terms agreement that was announced in January.</p>
<p>Under the deal, the supplier will power Palasino with its award-winning player account management platform, its content management system and front-end delivery. As a result, Trans World will be able to expand within the digital sector through its online subsidiary.</p>
<p>As announced by GiG, Plasino.com will target multiple international and emerging iGaming markets. The agreement is signed for an initial period of five years, the supplier said. It is expected to go live in the first half of 2023.</p>
<p>The growth of iGaming has prompted numerous companies to turn their gaze toward the digital sector. Trans World Hotels &amp; Entertainment is notably the ninth brick-and-mortar operator to have selected GiG for the digitalization of its offering.</p>
<p>Trans World has operated in the traditional casino sector for more than 25 years and operates a number of casinos and hotels in Europe. The casino and hospitality company is primarily focused on the Austrian, Czech and German markets as it seeks to expand its operations.</p>
<p>The Far East Consortium Is Excited to Launch iGaming from Malta</p>
<p>Colin Chapman Stewart, the director of gaming at Far East Consortium (FEC) which owns Trans World, commented on the new agreement. He noted that the partnership with GiG will provide the casino operator, the Palasino brand and FEC’s shareholders with confidence in their ability to launch an iGaming division with an MGA license.</p>
<p>Stewart said that his team hopes to bring online entertainment to players all over the world, helping them get the same feeling as if playing in a traditional casino.</p>
<p>GiG’s chief commercial officer, Marcel Elfersy, also commented on the matter. He said that GiG is pleased to close a deal with Palasino and provide it with many business opportunities. Elfersy concluded that iGaming continues to grow in Europe:</p>
<p>We’re continuing to see growth in the online gaming space across the industry, with the brand equity of experienced retail brands gelled with specialized third-party technology such as ours, positioned well to establish a strong foothold in global markets. Marcel Elfersy, CCO, GiG</p>
<p>iGaming is on the rise in Europe, making it the perfect time to launch an online brand. GiG noted that overall GGR in Europe is projected to climb at an annual rate of 7.6% to €37.3bn by 2026.</p>
