    <h1>Skyline Hotel And Casino Aruba Casino Biloxi Ms Casino Casinos In Minnesota Hard Rock Casino Las Veg</h1>

<p>If we went back to January 2020 and told people that they would be watching eNASCAR and everybody would love it, we would have got a snigger to say the least. Yet, eNASCAR is blasting at full speed, carried not only on its solid fan base but also on the photorealistic execution of the races themselves. And this weekend, we return for another look at the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series and specifically, the virtual North Wilkesboro Speedway race on Saturday, May 9 at 3 pm ET.</p>

It's too bad we'll never be back here to use it again." The virtual @iRacing return: May 9. 3p/et FOX, FS1. #nascar pic.twitter.com/jgD9dNQ9OP — Jeff Gordon Online (@JGinfo) May 8, 2020</p>
<p>Once again, the event will be broadcast on FOX, FS1, and be available via the FOX Sports app. Jeff Gordon, the 1996 NASCAR Cup Series race winner, is coming back to race once again. Meanwhile, FOX will break down the pixel-action for you, and not least, the betting odds are already out there, and you can place your bets.</p>
<p>Before we take a closer look at the race, we will first see what the available sportsbooks odds for the eNASCAR North Wilkesboro Speedway are.</p>

<p>eNASCAR Pro Series Invitational North Wilkesboro Speedway Betting Odds</p>
<p>Player Odds Timmy Hill +350 Ryan Preece +650 Denny Hamlin +800 Garrett Smithley +800 Parker Kligerman +800 Dale Earnhardt Jr +1200 John Hunter Nemcheck +1600 Landon Cassill +1600 Kyle Busch +1800 Christopher Bell +2000</p>
<p>*Odds taken May 8, 2020</p>
<p>This is going to be a very special race, as it will be wrapping up the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational – at least before regular NASCAR resumes. With the NASCAR Cup Series returning next week, Timmy Hill (+350) will have another chance to try and win a second title in the SIM. After all, he’s been given top odds at the start of every race, and it’s high time he lived up to the hype.</p>
<p>The driver has already had some success, too, winning the Texas Motor Speedway and is once again priced as the best value driver for the upcoming North Wilkesboro Speedway. One particular absence here is that of William Byron who has apparently had his fair share of iRacing and is now looking forward the real thing.</p>
<p>Byron took three races by storm in the eNASCAR iRacing Invitational winning Dover International Speedway, and then back-to-back Richmond Raceway and Bristol Motor Speedway.</p>
<p>Why he isn’t back doesn’t matter. What matters is that we have both Timmy Hill and Denny Hamlin (+800) gunning for another victory. Both drivers have one win each. Hamlin won the inaugural race, all the way back on March 22 when he raced past the final line at the Homestead-Miami Speedway.</p>
<p>Hill will start at the rear for this one and try to find his way to the front line in the 160-lap simulated race. Christopher Bell (+2000), who finished second behind Byron in the last race, will also be joining Hill in the back.</p>
<p>For this final race, we think it’s high time Timmy Hill won another one. If you plan on betting, Pick Hill.</p>
