<p>NFL Releases Schedule for Super Bowl Week in Las Vegas</p>
<p>Posted on: August 23, 2023, 02:56h.</p>

<p>We now know what else fans lucky enough to attend Super Bowl LVIII will be up to in Las Vegas during the week of Feb. 4-11, 2024. That’s because the NFL made several (very) pregame announcements on Wednesday, August 23.</p>

<p>A Super Bowl Opening Night celebration, open to all fans, will be held at Allegiant Stadium on Monday, Feb. 5, 2024. That’s six days before the first Super Bowl in Las Vegas kicks off on the same field on Sunday, February 11.</p>
<p>This event will include a press conference held by Super Bowl players and coaches. Though announced as their only public appearance before Super Bowl Sunday, only members of the media will have direct access to the teams.</p>
<p>Tickets, going for $30, will be available in December via SuperBowl.com.</p>
<p>Experience the Super Bowl</p>
<p>Another ticketed NFL event, the Super Bowl Experience — an interactive football theme park popping up every year during the host city’s Super Bowl Week — will occupy the Mandalay Bay Convention Center from Wednesday, February 7 through Saturday, Feb. 10, 2024.</p>
<p>It will offer fans opportunities to procure autographs, play interactive games, and take photos with the Vince Lombardi Trophy and a display case showing off all 57 Super Bowl rings.</p>
<p>Tickets for this event will also be available in December via SuperBowl.com, though no price points were announced.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Food Events</p>
<p>The recent NFL announcements also included the organization’s home base during game week. Caesars Palace has captured that title and will get to hold this year’s Super Bowl Breakfast on Saturday, February 10, from 8 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. PT. The private event has taken place in the Super Bowl host city every year since 1988.</p>
<p>To purchase tickets or register as a sponsor, visit the Super Bowl Breakfast website.</p>
<p>The hottest Super Bowl ticket for foodies will be Taste of the NFL, happening at 4 p.m. on Saturday, February 4, at the Keep Memory Alive Events Center at the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. This dinner event will feature a tasting menu curated by culinary superstars, including Andrew Zimmern, Carla Hall, Tim Love, Lasheeda Perry, and Mark Bucher. Appearances from more than 30 NFL greats have also been promised.</p>
<p>Tickets through Ticketmaster are a hefty $1,200. However, all proceeds benefit GENYOUth, a New York City-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by American dairy farmers and the NFL to create healthier school communities.</p>
