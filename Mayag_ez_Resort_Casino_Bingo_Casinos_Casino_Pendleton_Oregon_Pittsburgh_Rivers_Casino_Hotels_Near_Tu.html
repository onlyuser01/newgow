<p>Reevo will boost its product offering while Pragmatic Play will have its content reach more operators</p>
<p>B2B gaming content and aggregation platform, Reevo, announced it has joined forces with yet another leading content provider to the online casino industry, Pragmatic Play, to continue to grow its roster of platform partners.</p>
<p>Enhancing the Platform’s Product Offering</p>
<p>The new content partnership between Reevo and Pragmatic Play will see the content provider integrate its existing and future gaming content into the aggregation platform, boosting the platform’s product offering through and its ability to attract new business partners.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest content agreement, Petra Maria Poola, head of Sales at Reevo, said that the addition of Pragmatic Play is a “landmark signing” as part of the rapid integration of suppliers to the platform aimed at boosting its offering, pointing to Pragmatic Play’s tier-one supplier status in the industry.</p>
<p>“This will provide REEVO operator partners with even more proven, best-performing games they can seamlessly offer players via our industry-leading aggregation platform,” Poola concluded.</p>
<p>Following the agreement, Pragmatic Play will make available via the aggregation platform its diverse portfolio of slots, including player favorites Sugar Rush and Gates of Olympus, and recently released titles Gods of Giza and 3 Dancing Monkeys.</p>
<p>Extend Content Reach to More Brands</p>
<p>On behalf of Pragmatic Play, chief operating officer, Irina Cornides, commented on the partnership, pleased to see Pragmatic Play join forces with Reevo and extend the reach of the company’s gaming content to even more brands.</p>
<p>“We have a constant flow of great games being added every month to an already rich portfolio of slot content, from player-favorite titles to award-winning hits that are loved time and time again and we look forward to seeing what we can achieve together,” Cornides said.</p>
<p>The agreement is the latest for the aggregator that is committed to creating its list of proprietary games by launching two new titles per month while onboarding a diverse range of casino industry content suppliers and growing its roster of casino operators.</p>
<p>Earlier in April, Reevo signed a deal with the iGaming operator to further expand its presence in Europe by delivering a comprehensive suite of games, including Reel Fortune, Diamond Luck, Crazy Crocs and Wolf Wild, as well as games that are still in production, such as Mayan Magic Gold and Royal Bets, to local audiences.</p>
<p>A month earlier, Reevo signed a similar agreement with Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) to deliver its comprehensive suite of slot and table games, both in-house developed and third-party studio content, to players with GiG.</p>
