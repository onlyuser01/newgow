<p>The leading gaming solutions provider that has a presence in different jurisdictions around the globe, Intralot, announced a senior-level appointment last week.

Alexandros-Stergios Manos is a Non-Executive Member, while Ioannis Tsoumas, Adamantini Lazari and Dionysia Xirokosta hold the roles of Independent Non-Executive Members of the Group's Board.</p>
<p>It was back in June 2021 when Intralot elected its Board of Directors at its General Shareholders Assembly. The members were elected with a six-year term. The company explained that its Board will continue to represent and manage the company without a replacement for Nikolakopoulos.</p>
<p>Overall, Nikolakopoulos was a part of Intralot for nearly two decades. He first joined the company back in 2007. Since 2019, Nikolakopoulos has held the role of Deputy CEO. In addition, back in May 2022, he was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Intralot and has held a dual role since. Besides the aforementioned positions, Nikolakopoulos has also held the role of Group Chief Operations Officer as well as Group Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
<p>Sokratis Kokkalis, the Chairman and CEO of Intralot Group, thanked Byron Boothe, the outgoing CEO of Intralot's US-facing subsidiary, for his efforts and professionalism. He explained that thanks to Boothe's long-term commitment, the company's US subsidiary has seen significant growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, Kokkalis wished Nikolakopoulos success in his new role. In conclusion, he explained that Boothe will remain with the company by holding an advisor of the management role and being a member of the Group's Board of Directors.</p>
<p>It was more than three decades ago, back in 1992, when Intralot was established. Since then, the company has been continuously growing and now has a presence in 42 regulated jurisdictions. As an innovations-driven company, Intralot holds a unique market position that enables it to grow further.</p>
