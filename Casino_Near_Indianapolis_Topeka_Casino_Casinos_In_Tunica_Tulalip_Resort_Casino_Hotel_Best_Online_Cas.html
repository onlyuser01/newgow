    <h1>Casino Near Indianapolis Topeka Casino Casinos In Tunica Tulalip Resort Casino Hotel Best Online Cas</h1>

<p>The current deal marks the first time Light &amp; Wonder’s online gaming content will be available in the country</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder, a leading provider of casino products, has made a foray into Switzerland’s iGaming market thanks to an agreement with Grand Casino Luzern. As agreed, the former company will launch its OpenGaming aggregation platform with the operator, supplying it with iGaming content.</p>
<p>Grand Casino Luzern has dominated the Swiss online gambling market ever since the country regulated iGaming a few years ago. Its mycasino brand will now solidify its position as a leading operator thanks to the agreement with Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>Mycasino offers a vast selection of engaging games, which will be further diversified via the integration of OpenGaming. As a result, Light &amp; Wonder will power the brand with its library of proprietary and third-party content.</p>
<p>Swiss customers will therefore get to enjoy titles such as 88FORTUNES, RAGIN RHINO and SPARTACUS, among others.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Enters Switzerland’s Online Market</p>
<p>The current deal marks the first time Light &amp; Wonder’s online gaming content will be available in the country. The move will reinforce the company’s European footprint. Light &amp; Wonder already enjoys a strong presence in the region and has agreements with many operators. Its content, already available in land-based casinos in Switzerland, will now reach online gaming aficionados as well.</p>
<p>The Swiss iGaming market produced GGR of $250 million in 2022, making it a very appealing destination for online gambling companies.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s omni-channel strategy is crucial to its success in many of the markets where it operates, including in the Americas where it has a robust foothold.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Benefit Both Companies</p>
<p>Representatives of the two companies commented on the new deal with Magdalena Podhorska-Okolow, Light &amp; Wonder’s managing director of Europe, saying:</p>
<p>The regulated online market in Switzerland has been performing very well. We are thrilled to be making our market entry with Grand Casino Luzern, a strong brand in Switzerland with a player base that appreciates content with land-based roots. Magdalena Podhorska-Okolow, MD Europe, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Podhorska-Okolow noted that Light &amp; Wonder will leverage its OpenGaming platform to unleash a torrent of content for Grand Casino Luzern’s online customers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wolfgang Bliem, CEO of Grand Casino Luzern, said that his team seeks to provide players with the richest suite of innovative casino titles.</p>
<p>Partnering with Light &amp; Wonder and gaining access to household titles that players already love on the landbased side, allowing us to deliver the best content available within the regulated Swiss market. Wolfgang Bliem, CEO, Grand Casino Luzern</p>
<p>Bliem concluded that he is looking forward to working with Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
