    <h1>Buffalo Bill S Resort And Casino Primm Nevada Aquarius Casino Casino Online No Deposit Bonus New Buf</h1>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I registered here SlotV Casino today on 3.8.2022 and took the 100% Welcome Bonus. I deposited 180 euros and so I got another 180 euros as a bonus.</p>
<p>I started to play and felt lucky today. I won over 3000 euros in a single game, and after the welcome bonus wagering requirement my balance was almost 5000 euros.</p>
<p>At the end of the wagering I felt great and was preparing myself for a big incoming withdraw. Instantly after the last wagering spins I realized something weird. My balance dropped from circa 5000 euros to 692,50 euros! (see the screenshot).</p>
<p>I asked the chat, and he told something really weird (see the chat screenshots). He told that today morning they had changed the bonus rules so that a person can only take 500EUR from bonus. However, any kind of this does not read on their web page in the bonus rules. The chat told me that they will only be read there on the next morning. I had accepted the rules I read from the web page, and I dont think casino should change the rules during my game session without noticing me or writing the rules down to be visible. Also during the playing session I realized that soon after I started playing certain game, I realized that they changed the amount that counts to wagering from 100% to 50%. These games are not listed in their web bage neither (screenshot). Examples: Fat Rabbit, Mystery Museum.</p>
<p>I read carefully the rules again, and it says in their bonus rules nothing about the maximum winning amount with bonus. I have added the rules here as well as a screenshot. I thought that giving a " 100% bonus up to 500EUR " means the maximum bonus amount, not the maximum winning amount.</p>
<p>Please, help me in any possible way to get my money back.</p>
