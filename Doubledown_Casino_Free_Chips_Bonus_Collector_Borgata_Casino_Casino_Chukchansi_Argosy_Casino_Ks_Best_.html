    <h1>Doubledown Casino Free Chips Bonus Collector Borgata Casino Casino Chukchansi Argosy Casino Ks Best</h1>

<p>The globally-recognized technology company delivering solutions and services powering sports betting, casino, poker and other operators within the gambling vertical, Playtech, announced Monday it joined forces with the leading gaming operator in France, La Française des Jeux (FDJ). Thanks to the freshly minted partnership, FDJ will benefit from Playtech’s poker network, including content and services.</p>
<p>The new collaboration sees FDJ join Playtech’s extensive iPoker.EU Network. This is in fact one of the biggest liquidity pool networks on the Old Continent that is supported by leading software that ensures compliance within different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Per the new deal, FDJ will access not only the content package from Playtech but its services as well. As a result, the leading operator will gain access to poker tournaments, cash tables, as well as Twister Poker, Playtech’s flagship poker game.</p>
<p>At the same time, the collaboration complements Playtech’s growth within the poker vertical in the French Market. The country’s poker market continues to grow annually and has generated €10.7 billion in 2021, marking a year-over-year increase of 7%.</p>
<p>The deal with FDJ comes during a busy period of Playtech. Early last month, the company revealed that it joined forces with 10bet, a famous online gambling brand. At the time of the announcement, the company revealed that its UK and Sweden-facing businesses will benefit from sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>The Operator Is Delighted to Access Playtech’s Content</p>
<p>Richard Courtois, FDJ’s CEO of sports betting and online gaming, acknowledged Playtech’s strong presence as a content provider within the regulated gambling sector around Europe. At the same time, he spoke about the company’s understanding of the market in France and pointed out that the collaboration will help expand FDJ’s offering by delivering new games. Finally, Courtois predicted that the partnership will boost the company’s presence in the country.</p>
<p>“Thanks to Playtech, we are pleased to offer our players a new range of games. This move enables FDJ to complete its presence in the French online gaming market open to competition, based on a business model that combines performance and responsibility to keep gaming fun.“ Richard Courtois, CEO of sports betting and online gaming at FDJ</p>
<p>Marat Koss, Playtech’s VP of interactive gaming, shared his excitement about the latest deal. “We are very proud that FDJ has chosen Playtech as its partner, he said. Additionally, Koss pointed out that the leading operator will benefit from Playtech’s extensive network and deliver unique experiences for its growing customer base. Finally, he said that Playtech is looking forward to the success the deal with FDJ will bring.</p>
