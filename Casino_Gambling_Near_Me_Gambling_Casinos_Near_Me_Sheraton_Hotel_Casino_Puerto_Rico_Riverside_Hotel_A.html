    <h1>Casino Gambling Near Me Gambling Casinos Near Me Sheraton Hotel Casino Puerto Rico Riverside Hotel A</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have a question for you.</p>
<p>I registered today at the casino HotBet.</p>
<p>With the personal data (name, address, country, date of birth, etc.), one should also state the "condition" about oneself.</p>
<p>This "state" with NA was already specified.</p>
<p>I don't know what "state" means and what this "NA" means.</p>
<p>I don't want to give false profile information or deposit money or play until I don't know what that means.</p>
<p>When I asked the live chat, the HotBet agent couldn't explain to me what "condition" and "NA" (in response) mean.</p>
<p>Supposedly she asked HotBet's technical support and they couldn't answer my question either.</p>
<p>She wrote that I should simply deposit money and the question about the condition and the answer NA, so to speak, would not matter.</p>
<p>I took a screenshot of it (and erased my personal data).</p>
<p>Does anyone here know what "condition" and "NA" mean?</p>
<p>Nobody at HotBet seems to know that.</p>
<p>lG</p>
