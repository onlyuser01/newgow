    <h1>Jackson Rancheria Casino Stagedoor Casino Casino Niagara Hotel Wynn Casinos Casino Games With Best O</h1>

<p>Zorans, thank you for your advice. What you said in your first 5 paragraphs &amp; sentences, is what I did &amp; had happened. On Dec. 8, 2022, I started with a small bankroll with a $50 target a day, $1500 a month. I had won $51. Being a rookie, I was excited. After dinner, I was anxious to play another session. This is why the convenience of gambling from home is dangerous. I deviated from my game plan. Played, &amp; won $53. I was hooked. My 2nd day, I played 4 sessions. the 3rd session I ended with losing $14. Won $117. My 3rd day, 4 sessions. Won, 68, 70, 48, 61. 4th day 3 sessions, won 57, 60, 63. 4th day 2 sessions, won,54, 113. 5th day, 3 sessions, won 71, 73, 45. 6th day 3 sessions. lost 45, won 142, lost 123. I realized my system wasn't bulletproof. 7th day 2 sessions, won 258, 45. I made my 1st mistake, but didn't know I did. I wanted to make up the loss. What I should've done was stick to the plan of $50. 8th day, 3 sessions, won, 53, 24, 131. 9th day, 2 sessions, won 91, 193 10th day 1 session, won 112. My balance was $2742</p>
<p>I started my 11th day greedy. My session wins were never under 100. My next 8 sessions covered 3 days. &amp; were wins of, 155, 170, 175. 280, 426, 413, 472, 420. The last 2 wins were the same day. Rather than calling it a day, I got greedy. I played the 3rd session after dinner, I started off winning just over 200, but greed kept me playing. I started to lose &amp; continued losing. Emotions took over, then I lost my mind, &amp; ended up losing $3294. I started the session with $4231 &amp; ended with $937. I took the next 2 days off.</p>
<p>3 days after taking 2 days of evaluating what caused the loss of the most money in one hour of my life. my balance was $5255. That's $1024 more than what it was before the biggest loss in my life. It took 12 sessions over 3 days. I withdrew $3000. It was my 19th day. I still didn't learn anything.</p>
<p>On Feb. 3, 2023, with a $5000 bankroll. I was stupid &amp; got greedy. I set a 1 session target of $5000, I had done it over a dozen times in demo play without a loss &amp; ended up losing that &amp; the almost $2500 I had won. The same thing happened. I was winning, but kept going. I started losing. Emotions took over &amp; I lost my mind. My mind was blank. I wasn't thinking, except that the next spin will win, it has to. I had lost many spins in a row, a win will be the next spin. It never happened. The good thing was I had withdrawn, $3000, $3805, &amp; $4000. I tried downplaying, minimizing the loss telling friends that the casino just won back their money, until my best friend said. Was the money that you lost in your account? I said it was. He then said that it was your money that you lost, not the casinos. Point made.</p>
<p>I'm 64 as of last month, May 16th I started gambling at 63, &amp; have experienced a lot in a short time. One of my most important traits is learning from the mistakes I have made. Sometimes it took 2. Burning myself twice is enough to know that I don't want to be burned a third time. I have abandoned things before when I knew that I could be burned again</p>
<p>After being burned 2 times, I have only one more chance of making this work. I'm due to receive a settlement for pain, suffering &amp; loss of income from a car crash at no fault of my own that happened on May 3, 2021. I will copy your advice post &amp; include it with the other do's &amp; don'ts I have assembled.</p>
<p>Zorans, again, thank you for taking the time with sharing what you know. In a world where for the most part is every man for himself, it's awesome meeting someone who is willing to help.</p>
<p>Go make your own luck! Cheers!</p>
