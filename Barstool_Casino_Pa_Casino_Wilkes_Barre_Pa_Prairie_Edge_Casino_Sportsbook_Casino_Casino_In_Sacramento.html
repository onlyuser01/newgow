    <h1>Barstool Casino Pa Casino Wilkes Barre Pa Prairie Edge Casino Sportsbook Casino Casino In Sacramento</h1>

<p>The European Casino Association has awarded scholarships to two deserving candidates for this year’s ECA Diversity Scholarship, an annual program backed by AGEM, Clarion and the UNLV International Gaming Institute.</p>
<p>ECA’s Executive Development Program Returns</p>
<p>The Diversity Scholarship is now in its fifth year and is open to all ECA member employees. Successful candidates get to join the Executive Development Program (EDP) at Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in person. The scholarship covers all costs related to the program, allowing customers to expand their horizons.</p>
<p>The EDP has been around for over three decades and is now cemented as a reference point for gambling executives all over the world. The program teaches many key skills, such as leadership, management and strategic thinking. In addition, it helps people meet other industry executives and share experiences.</p>
<p>Now in its fifth year, the ECA scholarship programmed has grown in renown among European casino executives who recognize the wider learnings offered by the Executive Development Programme to the daily roles of our hard-working employees. Per Jaldung, chairman, ECA</p>
<p>This year’s edition of the ECA Diversity Scholarship has awarded scholarships to two applicants from the European casino industry. The winners were chosen by a jury, which consists of the ECA, Clarion, AGEM and UNLV. The first one is Kirsi Karola Lagus, a member of Finland’s Veikkaus. The second is Celine Alberola from Casino de Monte-Carlo in Monaco.</p>
<p>Two Women Were Awarded a Scholarship</p>
<p>Both scholarship winners spoke about their passions and goals. Lagus said that she loves developing herself and the organizations she works with. Seeing the progress she makes is something she always enjoys.</p>
<p>I feel passionate about continuously developing myself and the organizations I work with. Growth mindset, sincerity in interactions and braveness to face reality with a positive approach are the things that I cherish. Krisi Karola Lagus</p>
<p>Alberola, meanwhile, seeks to motivate her peers by sharing her experience and driving them to work harder.</p>
<p>I hope to inspire the members of my team by sharing my experience and thus instill in them a new impetus, a source of cohesion and personal development. Celine Alberola</p>
<p>Hermann Pamminger, general secretary of the ECA, said that the land-based industry is an in-person industry. He is, therefore, glad to see the Executive Development Program make a return.</p>
<p>It is with great satisfaction that the ECA has awarded two diversity scholarships in 2022, at a value of €12,000 each, as a reward for the dedication and career-orientated focus of two casino professionals who will gain unique knowledge and insights from the EDP to utilize in their everyday roles. Hermann Pamminger, general secretary, ECA</p>
<p>Pamminger concluded that the ECA will follow Alberola and Lagus’ careers with great interest.</p>
