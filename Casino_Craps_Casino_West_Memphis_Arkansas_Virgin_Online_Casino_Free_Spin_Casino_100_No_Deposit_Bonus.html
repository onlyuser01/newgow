<p>PSG is coming to Spain with a 1-0 advantage from the first leg. Now it’s up to Real Madrid to try and win by at least two goals. Can Los Blancos pull it off? Online sportsbooks sure think so, giving the role of the favorite to the home team.</p>
<p>Still, PSG’s #1 goal for the 2021-22 season is the Champions League. This team’s never had such a strong roster as this year, which explains why oddsmakers see them as one of the top title favorites. At the moment of writing, PSG is priced at +600 at most betting sites. Meanwhile, the odds of Real Madrid winning the UCL title this year are as long as +2500.</p>

<p>Real Madrid Doing Great at Home</p>
<p>Los Blancos are without a home loss since September when they (shockingly) lost to Sheriff Tiraspol 2-1 in the Champions League. Since then, we saw Real Madrid win 11 games at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, while drawing another three.</p>
<p>Another draw will not get them anywhere. The only way to advance to the next phase of the Champions League is to win on Wednesday. A win by a single goal would take them to extra time. However, if they win by more than that, they’re going to knock PSG out of the competition.</p>
<p>So, can they do it? Los Blancos do have some amazing players on the roster, with Karim Benzema being their best player this season. The Frenchman has scored 27 goals in 32 games he played this season across all competitions.</p>
<p>The best thing is that he’s in top form lately, scoring three goals in the past three games, as well as making three assists.</p>
<p>Champions League is PSG’s Top Focus</p>
<p>Within the past 10 years, PSG has spent over $1 billion on transfers. The result is that this team’s squad is packed with superstars. Of course, the biggest star is Lionel Messi, who joined PSG last summer. The Messiah hasn’t been great in the French domestic league, but in the Champions League, he’s been fabulous.</p>
<p>Sure, he did miss a penalty three weeks ago against Real Madrid, but in total, he has five goals to his name in this competition. That’s the same number of goals that Kylian Mbappe’s scored in the UCL this season. With two of them upfront, PSG definitely looks capable of scoring. Neymar is also expected to play well, as well as Mauro Icardi, and many others.</p>
<p>They can score, but can they outscore attacking-minded Real Madrid? It’s not going to be easy to win, but they do have the manpower to get at least a draw.</p>
