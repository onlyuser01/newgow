<p>AS Roma vs Lazio a.k.a. the Rome Derby or Derby della Capitale is the fiercest rivalry in the Italian Serie A and one of the biggest fixtures in European soccer. This season, it’s going to be particularly interesting as both teams are playing great soccer in 2022. Right now, AS Roma is sitting in the #4 position in the Serie A standings, while Lazio is one spot below with just one point fewer.</p>
<p>If the Rome Derby finished in a tie, both teams couple end up dropping a spot down. If one of them wins on Sunday, the team in question could potentially move up all the way to the #2 position. What this means is that the AS Roma vs Lazio is not only a fierce intercity derby, but also a game that could help one of them get into the race for the 2022-23 Serie A title.</p>

<p>Mourinho’s Boys Love Playing Big Games</p>
<p>AS Roma is 8-1-3 in the Italian Serie A, with a total of 25 points after 12 matches. Their score differential is 16-11, which doesn’t do them any justice, considering that their defense has been phenomenal. You’d think that 11 goals allowed in 12 games isn’t too worth praise, but they haven’t conceded more than a single goal per game since losing 4-0 to Udinese in early September.</p>
<p>Knowing this, you’d think that Mourinho’s parked his famous bus in front of the goal, but that’s not completely true. In fact, his boys have been pretty good in the offense, scoring a goal in 10 of their 12 games of the 2022-23 Serie A season.</p>
<p>Paulo Dybala is their scoring leader with five goals to his name. Unfortunately for them, the Argentine forward will miss the Rome Derby due to an injury.</p>
<p>Lazio Without Its Top Scorer</p>
<p>Ciro Immobile is ruled out of the Rome Derby. The man who’s been Lazio’s goalscoring machine for ages will have to skip Sunday’s game. Without him, the Sky Blues aren’t going to be too dangerous in the offense.</p>
<p>We’re not saying this without proof – his backup Matteo Cancellieri is without a single goal to his name despite playing 15 games in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>There are some elite midfielders on Lazio’s roster, including Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Matias Vecino, Mattia Zaccagni, and others. Still, these guys are guaranteed to struggle to break AS Roma’s defensive wall.</p>
<p>AS Roma vs Lazio Prediction</p>
<p>The Rome Derby is going to be a real battle in the center of the pitch, but we probably aren’t going to witness too many goal chances by either team. And with their key strikers missing out, these two probably won’t score too many goals. That said, a low-scoring draw seems like the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>Picks: Draw and under 2.5 goals.</p>
