    <h1>Golden Gate Hotel Casino Parkwest Bicycle Casino Deadwood Sd Casinos Rail City Casino Oak Grove Casi</h1>

<p>iGaming aggregator with a bulging portfolio counting 5000+ games from over 60 suppliers Groove has signed a content distribution partnership with Spinomenal. Groove has agreed to spread out the provider’s Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) licensed games across the European continent. What will the new deal mean for both parties? While Spinomenal is looking forward to further expanding its business to more regulated markets, Groove expects to attract more operators to its platform.</p>
<p>The New Deal, “Central” to Spinomenal’s Plans</p>
<p>The new partnership will make Spinomenal’s top-notch content a lot more accessible to the aggregator’s casino operator partners. This will be crucial in helping the supplier reach its development goals with more ease. The MGA-approved library of games will soon reach players from a number of licensed European jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The list includes titles like Majestic King, Egyptian Rebirth II, 4, Book of Wolves, Demi Gods IV Thunderstorm, Wolf Fang Iron Wolf, Book of the Divine, Majestic King Sunset, Reels of Rio, Queen of Ice, and Poseidon’s Rising. The supplier has high hopes regarding additional licenses being granted to it from the governing bodies in Greece, New Jersey, Ontario, and the UK.</p>
<p>Groove’s chief operating officer Yahale Meltzer spoke about Spinomenal’s “impressive suite of games” backed by the talented team eager to become the “business darling” for operators who share the same vision.</p>
<p>Spinomenal is one of the fastest-developing iGaming content suppliers with a rich portfolio consisting of over 200 HTML5-based titles. The library is freshened up every month with up to 16 new games. Machine learning, top graphics and innovative game features are all part of the continuous work of the Spinomenal team.</p>
<p>Groove Achieved the ISO27001 Milestone</p>
<p>Groove believes the new deal that includes Spinomenal’s prestigious MGA license will help it attract a larger number of operator partners to its platform. Groove was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur Yahale Meltzer and Gil Strauss, former alumni at Microsoft.</p>
<p>The company quickly received the support of a number of anchor investors and started distributing casinos and operators advisory and data analytics services, along with a top platform and an efficient game aggregator. Groove managed to attract an impressive plethora of clients in just six years thanks to its one-of-a-kind brand promise and daily insights. The platform distributes fresh content that uses a proprietary plug-and-play format mixed with state-of-the-art technology.</p>
<p>Their 6-Continents Strategy relies on data empowerment. Groove achieved the ISO27001 milestone which refers to the highest data privacy and data protection standards in the iGaming industry. The certification that earned the trust and respect of a large number of regulatory bodies worldwide was also received by Spinomenal in March 2022. At the end of December Groove signed an exciting deal with software and platform supplier Betby.</p>
