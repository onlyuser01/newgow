<p>Flutter Entertainment is launching with PokerStars in Greece, marking another European market where the acclaimed card room and gaming operator will be available. The launch follows an application period that resulted in license acquisition in 2021.</p>
<p>Greece Becomes Latest PokerStars Market Entry</p>
<p>Now, the Hellenic Gaming Commission (HGC) has given the green light for PokerStars Sports, PokerStars Casino, and the PokerStars card room to launch in the country and bring its full suite of products. The company originally received the licenses in July 2021, but the official launch is only happening now.</p>
<p>The company enables local players to pick from its play and real money poker games and tournaments, casino content, and sports betting markets. The PokerStars.GR website serves as a one-stop-shop for players who can navigate each of the verticals they are interested in best.</p>
<p>The platform is available to players across a number of devices and operating systems, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. Commenting on this launch, Flutter International CEO Dan Taylor said:</p>
<p>“Launching PokerStars under a full local license in Greece follows months of hard work from teams across the business. I’d like to thank them all for helping to make PokerStars’ range of safe and trusted products available to players in Greece and for contributing towards our ongoing strategy of growing our business in international regulated markets.” Flutter International CEO Dan Taylor</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment has been building an empire of betting, gaming, and poker products. The company has been able to establish itself on the international market through brands such as Adjarabet, Betfair, and Junglee.</p>
<p>Global Hegemony Across Prominent Brands</p>
<p>Flutter is similarly represented in Australia through Sportsbet and it holds numerous assets in the United States. Those include FanDuel, Fox Bet, Stardust, and naturally the PokerStars brands, which are dominating the real money poker market in the USA.</p>
<p>Even though PokerStars took a hit to its event schedule in Europe, following the postponement of the European Poker Tour, it has been able to carry forth with its plans in Greece. PokerStars also became a Red Bull’s Formula 1 race team partner earlier this month.</p>
