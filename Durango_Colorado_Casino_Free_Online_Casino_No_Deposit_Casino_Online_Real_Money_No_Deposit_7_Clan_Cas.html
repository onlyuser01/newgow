    <h1>Durango Colorado Casino Free Online Casino No Deposit Casino Online Real Money No Deposit 7 Clan Cas</h1>

<p>I requested a payment of $340 on 14/9/2023 they have not paid.</p>
<p>I was quite suspicious since they offered only 3x wagering for 300% bonus, which seems very low, I asked the live chat what the catch was and they said no catch. So I deposited $100, asked chat again what wagering was, they confirmed $300. I did over $300 wager (maybe $400?) and requested withdrawal. I noticed a few days later they rejected the withdrawal (without telling me) back into my casino account, it was returned to account and said that it still had $104 (I think) wagering required, so I did another $300 or so wagering and then requested again the withdrawal. Then again the same thing a few days later, again I wager a bit more and then it dissapears from my account except for $43. I ask support why this happened and they say:</p>
<p>"We have checked your account and noticed the withdrawal request was rejected due to the fact that you did not wager your welcome deposit bonus before/while placing the withdrawal request.</p>
<p>The bonus had a 3X wagering requirement with 7 days to complete the wager. Since you did not fulfill the bonus terms, it got canceled, and your account balance was adjusted."</p>
<p>I reply:</p>
<p>"This is not true, I asked live support what the wagering requirement was and I wagered well over that amount, you then rejected it, and I wagered again yet more, I have wagered well over 3x."</p>
<p>After this there email server has me (or everyone) blocked:</p>

<p>This looks to me like an outright scam casino so I am confused why they have a good rating here.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
