    <h1>Max Casino Casino In Oklahoma Illinois Casino Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort D Iberville Ms Casino Near</h1>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>Unfortunately the payout system isn't as simple as we would all prefer, we depend on 3rd party payment providers and must adhere to their particular directives in order to facilitate payment. Payment is issued by the casino to the 3rd party using the approved payment details on file in the player account, in this case the approved method of withdrawal on file was still registered as check payment.</p>
<p>It is of course possible to switch to wire payment however it's not as simple as requesting it to be paid as wire in the requested withdrawal. The necessary account details and documentation must be first submitted and reviewed to assure that payment can be made to that specific account as required by the 3rd party payment providers.</p>
<p>There are still a few minor details required and we have reached out to assist in the changeover for future withdrawals. That said, cancelling a physical check carries a $250 fee from the 3rd party which is removed before payment is reissued to the player as well as the subtraction of the wire fees. Also there is the issue of time in terms of reissue of payment and delivery from the 3rd party which cumulatively could equal the bank processing time on the check.</p>
<p>It's not ideal, and pleases no one least of all us. Certainly we all wish (none more than us) that this process could be simplified (crypto currency is paving the way for a brighter and more efficient future we believe) but this is the situation currently.</p>
<p>In short, the most prudent plan of action is to be patient and stick with the current withdrawal method I'm afraid.</p>
<p>As an organization we do apologize for the delay and any undue stress, hopefully the check will be delivered shortly and processed by the bank in good time.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Nick and Slots of Vegas</p>
