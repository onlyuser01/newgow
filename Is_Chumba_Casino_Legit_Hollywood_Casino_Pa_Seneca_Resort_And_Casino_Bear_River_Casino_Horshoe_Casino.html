    <h1>Is Chumba Casino Legit Hollywood Casino Pa Seneca Resort And Casino Bear River Casino Horshoe Casino</h1>

<p>The casino has a very good rating on our website, no unresolved complaints and really just a few complaints submitted. They're licensed in Malta, which is usually better than Curacao.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find it to be really strange that they requested your investments portfolio. I've never heard about a similar case. It might be because your other documents state that some of your income is based on the investments. That might be the explanation.</p>
<p>You have no obligation to share which investments you have (specifically), but for example if you have an account with a broker, they offer yearly reports or you could take screenshots from the withdrawal/deposit history so the casino could see that you actually use it any make some profit on it.</p>
<p>If you disagree with the casino, you could contact MGA - the licensing authority. They may decide what the casino can request from you. But if I were you, I'd try to provide something that wouldn't be too detailed and too personal just to fulfil the casino's requirements and get the winnings. You can always close your account after that if you don't like how they treat you.</p>
