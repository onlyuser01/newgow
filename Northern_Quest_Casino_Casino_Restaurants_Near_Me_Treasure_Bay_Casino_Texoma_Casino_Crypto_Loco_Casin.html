<p>The increase in the state’s gambling revenue was primarily driven by the growth of online slots and gaming tables</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has published its report for September, outlining the performance of the Pennsylvanian casino and betting industry. Reflecting the overall growth of the gambling industry in the United States, the Keystone State reported a revenue growth of 6.2%.</p>
<p>According to the PGCB, all forms of gambling collectively earned approximately $476.3 million in September, surpassing last year’s results. This number includes slot machines, table games, iGaming, sports betting, fantasy contests and video gaming terminals.</p>
<p>The regulator provided detailed data about the performance of the separate verticals, showing that retail slots remained the biggest revenue driver. For reference, retail slots recorded revenue of $199.9 million in September 2023. This figure represents a modest 0.7% increase year-on-year. Retail tables revenue, on the other hand, experienced a slight decline of 7.83% year-on-year to $75.2 million.</p>
<p>Online slot revenue, meanwhile, skyrocketed by 47.3% to $114.7 million. This was the most significant growth recorded by any vertical, attesting to the increased demand for online gaming. IGaming tables recorded the second most significant change, with revenue having increased by 31.65% to $42.3 million.</p>
<p>All the remaining verticals experienced a decline. Sports betting revenue, for example, plummeted to $36.6 million, representing a decline of 27.05%. VGT revenue, meanwhile, dropped by 7.18%, reaching $3.2 million.</p>
<p>The online poker vertical failed to replicate the spectacular success of online slots and table games, instead experiencing a decline of 10.43%. For reference, the vertical reported $2.4 million in revenue for September.</p>
<p>Finally, the PGCB reported that fantasy contests revenue declined by 6.55% to $1.76 million.</p>
<p>The results show that the increase in the state’s gambling revenue was primarily driven by the growth of online slots and gaming tables.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino Continued to Be the Top Performer</p>
<p>The PGCB also provided details about the performance of its gambling operators. The data shows that the market was dominated by Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, which earned $77 million (16.75% up, year-on-year). Next up was Valley Forge Casino Resort with revenue of $66 million. This property reported the most substantial growth at 24.55%.</p>
<p>Next up is Parx Casino with revenue of $55.8 million, which is more or less in line with the September 2022 results. It was followed closely by Rivers Casino Philadelphia with revenue of $47.4 million. Rounding up the top 5 is Wind Creek Bethlehem with revenue of $45.6 million.</p>
<p>In other news, recent reports revealed that the total number of slot machines in the state has declined amid fierce competition for market share.</p>
