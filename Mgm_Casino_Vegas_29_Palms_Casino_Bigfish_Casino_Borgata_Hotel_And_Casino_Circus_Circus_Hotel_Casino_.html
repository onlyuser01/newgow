<p>A new partnership between 888 Holdings and 1×2 Network will now allow 888 Casino to offer dedicated new gaming products by Iron Dog Studio and 1×2 Gaming, with the option to scale this offer.</p>
<p>888 Casino Expands Reach of Products with 1×2 Network</p>
<p>1×2 Network has teamed up with 888 Holdings to bring its proprietor and aggregate products to the 888 brands. As a result, 888 will add a series of RNG games to its portfolio, allowing players to experience 1×2 Network products for the first time.</p>
<p>Sealing a few important partnerships just recently, and specifically with Leap Gaming and Gaming Innovation Group, 1×2 Network will now up the ante for 888’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Commenting on these important developments, 1×2 Network Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), Kevin Reid, noted that his company was delighted to team up with 888 and unfold its entire portfolio of games at one of the world’s best-known gaming brands.</p>
<p>“We’re immensely proud of our content offering, and we want more and more players to experience what we have to offer. We’ve got no doubt that it’ll prove a hit with the 888 audience,” Reid continued.</p>
<p>As a result from the deal, players at 888 Casino will get a chance to play games by popular studios, such as Iron Dog Studio and 1×2 Gaming, with multiple available titles, and not least Theseus Rises, Book of Lok, Battle Maidens, and dozens of viable other picks.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, 888 SVP Business 2 Customer, Guy Cohen, said that the link-up was an exciting one for his company. 888 believed that the new titles would implement well into the existing offer and help boost the user experience.</p>
<p>The company has also previously pledged to rev up its commitment to responsible gambling earlier this year, which it has been delivering on consistently. Previously, 888 forged another similar alliance with another renowned developer, ReelNRG.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 888 has also been posting great results in other verticals. The company reported a 60% increase in its online poker traffic in the United States during the lockdown. Other recent deals involving 888 included a partnership signed in April with Realistic.</p>
<p>The company’s revenue went up in the latest earnings call but profit took a slight tumble. However, 888 cited a continuous improvement across all of its main segments, to wit sports, casino, and poker, driving steady forays forward.</p>
