<p>Friday, August 5, 2022, marks the start of a brand-new season of the Bundesliga. It also marks the first time that the reigning champions Bayern Munich will play in the German league without the club legend Robert Lewandowski. The Polish goal machine has moved to Barcelona, making Bayern fans worry about the gap left in the final third.</p>
<p>However, judging by what we saw from this team in the German Super Cup, fans have no reasons for concern. The game was played last Saturday, and we saw Bayern beat RB Leipzig 5-3. Are we going to see them do something similar in the 2022-23 Bundesliga opener against Eintracht Frankfurt?</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think so, but the reigning Europa League champions mustn’t be underestimated, especially when playing on their turf. That said, we expect to see a very exciting game at Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt, and if you’d like to see our prediction for this game, just keep on reading!</p>

<p>Eintracht Frankfurt Have High Ambitious for the 2022-23 Season</p>
<p>Last season, Eintracht Frankfurt finished in the #11 position in the Bundesliga, which is far from impressive. The reason for that, however, is that they were occupied with their Europa League campaign. That’s the competition they won last season, which earned them a spot in the Champions League in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>They would love to do well in the continent’s elite competition, but they also want to finish in the top half of the table in the domestic league. In order to boost their chances of achieving those plans, Eintracht Frankfurt made a number of signings over the summer transfer period, most notably capturing the signature of former German international Mario Gotze, a forward famous for scoring the only goal in the 2014 World Cup Final.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich Don’t Care About Lewandowski Anymore</p>
<p>Robert Lewandowski’s contract with Bayern Munich ended this summer, after which he moved to Barcelona. Rather than signing a player similar to the Polish superstar, they brought in Sadio Mane from Liverpool, a player who’s played on the flank throughout his career.</p>
<p>Although he’s not the same type of player as Lewandowski, Mane seems to be doing the job well. In fact, we saw him score a goal in his debut with Bayern Munich. He was one of five different players who scored against RB Leipzig a week ago. The fact that so many players ended up on the scoresheet shows that Bayern Munich’s strength comes from teamwork rather than individual brilliance.</p>
<p>Eintracht Frankfurt vs Bayern Munich Prediction</p>
<p>The fact that Bayern Munich has been in the possession of the Bundesliga title since the 2012-13 season means that this team needs to be thought of as the favorite against any opponent from Germany. We think the visitors are going to win on Saturday, but we’re also sure the hosts will give them a run for their money. That said, we expect to see plenty of goals in this match.</p>
<p>Picks: Bayern Munich to win; over 3.5 goals</p>
