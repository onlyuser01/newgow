<p>Find the best online casinos on Casino Guru</p>
<p>Helping our visitors find top online casinos is one of the main missions of Casino Guru. Having reviewed over 6,000 casino sites – literally every single casino site we've been able to find – we know what to look for when deciding which gambling site deserves to be called one of the best online casinos in 2024.</p>
<p>We meticulously and methodically review each casino site listed on our website, with a focus on fairness and safety. We consider these the most important factors influencing the quality of online casinos, because we believe that players should be able to play real money online casino games and withdraw their winnings without experiencing issues like blocked accounts or declined withdrawals.</p>
<p>That's why you see the Safety Index displayed next to each casino listed above. This is our safety score, which we calculate for all online casinos we review. It is based on a number of factors, such as:</p>
<p>Fairness of Terms and Conditions – We carefully read and evaluate each clause listed in each casino's T&amp;Cs to uncover potentially unfair, misleading, or questionable rules. Such rules can potentially be used against players in a way we consider unfair, so the casino's Safety Index is lowered for each unfair clause.</p>

Such rules can potentially be used against players in a way we consider unfair, so the casino's Safety Index is lowered for each unfair clause. Casino size – We believe that bigger casinos are, in general, safer for players. This is because their size is a sign of quality and stability, allowing them to pay out big wins without running into financial difficulties. We have seen many cases of smaller casinos struggling to pay out players who managed to win big. This is why the known or estimated size of each casino is a factor contributing to its Safety Index.</p>

Player complaints – Complaints submitted to our Complaints Resolution Center or collected from other sources tell us a lot about how a casino treats its players, as well as what kinds of issues they face while playing. We thoroughly consider each complaint and decrease a casino's Safety Index for each justified complaint that has not been resolved by the casino. Complaints are considered in proportion with a casino's size, as bigger casinos are expected to receive more of them.</p>

We thoroughly consider each complaint and decrease a casino's Safety Index for each justified complaint that has not been resolved by the casino. Complaints are considered in proportion with a casino's size, as bigger casinos are expected to receive more of them. Casino blacklists – There are several websites that publish a blacklist of online casinos, including our own Casino Guru blacklist. If a casino appears on a blacklist, it can be an indicator of its negative qualities. We take a look at each listing and decrease the Safety Index of blacklisted casinos according to the reasoning behind it and our evaluation.</p>
<p>Basically, we look for anything that could make your online casino experience unsafe or less enjoyable. The higher the Safety Index, the more likely you are to be able to enjoy real money online casino games and be able to cash out your winnings from the casino without running into issues which might be common at online casinos with a low Safety Index.</p>
<p>Note: If you wish to learn more about any listed online casino, clicking the 'Read review' button will open its full review, complete with its pros and cons, available games, payment options, reviews and ratings submitted by other players, as well as an explanation of its Safety Index and findings from our review.</p>
<p>About our casino review team</p>
<p>Everything you can see on this page would not be possible without the hard work of our dedicated and independent casino review team, whose sole responsibility is to find out everything there is to learn about every single online casino we add to our database.</p>
<p>We have set out on a mission to review and evaluate every single online casino that exists (or at least all casinos we manage to find). This allows us to consider all available options when putting together the list of best online casinos you can see on this page.</p>
<p>It also allows us to have information about all casinos – including the ones that we do not recommend – so that our visitors can check any casino website before playing and find out whether it is a fair and safe place to gamble at.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this takes a lot of hard work. We currently have more than 6,000 online casinos in our database, all of which have been through our methodical process that evaluates the casino's qualities, with a focus on fairness and player safety. We add tens or hundreds of new casinos to our database and continuously revisit existing ones to keep our information up to date.</p>
<p>All of this is done by a dedicated team of more than 15 casino specialists led by Matej Novota, who has been part of the Casino Guru team basically since the beginning and has helped set up and fine-tune our casino review methodology.</p>
<p>Matej and the rest of the team go truly in-depth with each online casino they evaluate. They check each casino's website, thoroughly read the Terms and Conditions to uncover and unfair rules, evaluate player complaints, check licenses and company information, and go through countless other steps required to learn everything we need to know to evaluate an online casino and decide whether we are going to recommend it to our visitors or not.</p>
<p>Note: To learn more about our team of casino analysts, go to our About us page, and scroll down to a section about our team. Look for team members listed as casino analysts. Clicking on anyone will bring up their profile, allowing you to learn about people responsible for the information about online casinos listed on Casino Guru.</p>

<p>Casino Guru's popular filters to help you find the best casino</p>
<p>How to start playing at an online casino for real money</p>
<p>If you would like to start playing at a real money online casino, the process should be pretty straight-forward. Here are the steps you should follow:</p>
<p>Select you preferred online casino from the list on this page. Use the information above on how to choose the best option for you thanks to our advanced filters and sorts. If you need more information about any particular casino, click through to its review, where you should be able to find everything you need to make a good decision. Click on the 'Visit casino' button. You will be taken directly to the casino's website. Create a casino account. At most real money online casinos, you will be able to find a button that takes you to the registration form (e.g., Register, Create an account, Start playing). Fill in the detail required by the casino and proceed through the registration steps. Make sure to enter your truthful and correct personal information. Verify your e-mail or phone number. Most casinos will send you a verification e-mail or text message to make sure you entered correct contact information. Make a deposit. Unless you receive a no deposit bonus from the casino, you will have to deposit real money into your casino account to be able to start playing. Proceed to the Cashier section of the casino, choose your preferred payment method, and go through the steps to fund your casino account. Start playing. Once all of the steps above are completed, you will be ready to start playing. Play your favorite casino games or explore new ones, but make sure to gamble responsibly.</p>
<p>Note: At some point, you will have to go through a verification process at most online casinos. Also known as KYC (Know Your Customer), this process verifies that your personal details match those entered during registration, most commonly by checking your ID, bank or utility statement, or other documents. This is why you should always use your own and correct information when creating a casino account.</p>
<p>Online casino withdrawals</p>
<p>Cashing out money from your casino account is usually pretty straightforward, perhaps with the exception of your first withdrawal. This is because many casinos start the KYC process when they receive your first withdrawal request. If that happens, cooperate with the casino and submit the required documents for verification.</p>
<p>Most commonly, you will be able to withdraw funds using the payment method you also used to make a deposit. For example, if you deposited using your Mastercard, your withdrawal will be processed using the same card.</p>
<p>Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, for example if the method used for deposit is not supported for withdrawals. In these cases, you will most likely have to verify another payment method, so that the casino can be sure it is yours.</p>
<p>The process of requesting a withdrawal usually starts in the Cashier section of the casino's website, just like it does when you are making a deposit. Locate the withdrawal section there, enter the amount you would like to withdraw, and confirm to submit your request. Some casinos will ask you to enter your password when requesting withdrawal, but that should be it, at least if your account and payment method are already verified.</p>
<p>The speed of the withdrawal will depend on the casino, as well as your payment method of choice. Some withdrawals are processed and transferred pretty much instantly, but some can take days or even weeks. Of course, if your withdrawal triggers a verification process, the overall duration will depend on that, too.</p>
<p>Games available at top online casinos</p>
<p>The selection of slots and other types of real money casino games is an important factor to consider when selecting a casino to play at. After all, gambling should first and foremost be fun, and the games we play at online casinos greatly influence this aspect.</p>
<p>Luckily, many modern online casino sites have vast libraries of casino games on offer, ranging from slots, through table games like blackjack or roulette, to less frequent options like crash games or keno.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the most common and popular types of casino games:</p>
<p>Slots – Undoubtedly the number one most popular option, slots are easy to play and come in all shapes and sizes. You can find hundreds or even thousands of titles at top online casinos, with all the features, bonus rounds, free spins, and anything else you can imagine.</p>

You do this by getting closer to the sum of 21 than the dealer, without going over. Blackjack requires some know-how to minimize the casino's advantage, so we do not recommend it to beginners.</p>

Baccarat – Simple card game, in which you bet on the banker to win, the player to win, or a tie. The game seems quite complex, but as all the rules are set, so you generally do not need to make any further decisions after placing your bet. Just stay away from betting on a tie, as it has the highest house edge.</p>

Live dealer games – To bring the brick-and-mortar experience online, casinos started offering live dealer games that are streamed from a studio with a real person in charge of the gameplay. You can play table games with a live dealer, as well as intricate game shows.</p>

You can play table games with a live dealer, as well as intricate game shows. Jackpot games – Some games come with a progressive jackpot that grows over time until a lucky player wins it. These can result in extremely high wins in some cases, but you should keep in mind that winning the jackpot is extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>As you can see, you should be able to find enjoyable games at any of the top-rated casinos listed above. The types of available games are listed right next to each casino, and information about game providers is available in each casino's review.</p>
<p>If your preferences are specific, you can use our filters to limit the selection of displayed casino sites to those that offer a certain type of casino games (such as slots or roulette) or games from a specific game provider (such as Pragmatic Play, NetEnt, or many others).</p>
<p>Note: If you want to go a step further and make sure a casino has a specific game on offer, the best thing you can do is to visit the casino and check for yourselves. Alternatively, go to our database of free casino games, find the game you wish to play there (or use our search), and click 'Play in a casino'. Then, you'll be shown a list of recommended casinos at which you are most likely to find it.</p>
<p>Learn how casino games work</p>
<p>If you are new to online casinos, it is important you know how real money casino games work when playing online. Slots, roulette, blackjack, and other popular types of games each have their own specifics, but there is one underlying aspect they have in common – the casino has an edge.</p>
<p>Casino games are configured to give the casino an advantage (also known as house edge), which ensures that casinos stay profitable in the long run. You can still win; however, over a long period of time and with a large number of players, the casino will almost certainly be profitable. In short, you are virtually always playing at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>We believe that knowing this will help you make better decisions when it comes to casino games, as it doesn't give you unrealistic expectations of winning money on a long-term basis. And, as we always say, gambling at online casinos should be about having fun, not about making money.</p>
<p>Watch our video explaining how casino games of chance work</p>
<p>Note: If you wish to learn more, our online casino guide section has plethora of articles about how casino games work in general, as well as guides to specific games like slots, roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and others.</p>
<p>Online casinos with bonuses</p>
<p>Online casino bonuses are extremely popular amongst players, as they allow them to play for free or give them something extra when they make a real money deposit. If you care about bonuses, you will see an offer listed next to most of the top casinos listed above.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about bonuses offered by any of the casinos, click 'Read review' and proceed to the 'Bonuses' section of our review. There, all available bonuses offered by that casino are listed, together with their Terms and Conditions, which will help you choose the best offer for you.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if bonuses are your main priority, it might be better for you to proceed to our list of no deposit bonuses or deposit bonuses – depending on which option you prefer – and browse offers from all online casinos.</p>
<p>Responsible and safe gambling at online casinos</p>
<p>Playing real money casino games online can be fun, but it can also have a negative impact on people's lives. Besides the possibility of losing money, gambling addiction can be extremely dangerous, which emphasizes the importance of safer and responsible gambling, such as setting a budget and limits in advance, as well as looking for help if you gambling habits start getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Our responsible gambling section contains a plethora of information on the topic, allowing you to stay informed on how to gamble safely, where to look for help if needed, and many other topics. If you feel like you are at risk, don't hesitate to talk to a professional.</p>
<p>Note: Whatever you do, you should always consider gambling a form of entertainment, not as a way of making money or solving your financial issues. You are always playing at a disadvantage against a casino. Keep that in mind at all times.</p>
