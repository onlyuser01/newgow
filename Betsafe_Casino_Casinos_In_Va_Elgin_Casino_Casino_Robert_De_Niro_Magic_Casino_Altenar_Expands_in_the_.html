<p>The larger corporate headquarters opening in the Isle of Man complements the growth of the company and enables it to capture new talent</p>
<p>The leading iGaming and sportsbook software supplier, Altenar, expanded further its footprint by announcing the opening of its new, larger corporate headquarters located in the Isle of Man. The latest announcement represents an important achievement for the company as complements its growth in the Isle of Man and boosts its global footprint.</p>
<p>Celebrating the opening of the corporate headquarters, Altenar arranged a glamorous ceremony recently. The new corporate headquarters will serve as a home for the company’s finance, compliance and legal teams. Additionally, thanks to the larger office location, Altenar will be able to train and invest in local experts, complementing its status as an accredited training employer with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).</p>
<p>The opening of the larger corporate headquarters comes during a busy period for the company. Earlier this month, Altenar announced it signed a new strategic content partnership with Vermantia, the first performance-driven, content and technology supplier that provides solutions for global betting companies. Per the freshly minted collaboration, Altenar boosted its racing capabilities by tapping into premium racing content and data from Vermantia.</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the new Isle of Man office, Altenar’s chief financial officer (CFO), John Quaye, shared his excitement on the topic. He explained that the new office represents an important milestone within the company’s ongoing growth. At the same time, Quaye explained: “The investment we’ve made, gives our dedicated employees first-class facilities and supports our aim to grow our workforce further in the Isle of Man, as is our aim across the entire Altenar group, providing comfortable and positive working environments.”</p>
<p>“With the opening of our new offices, we embark on the next exciting chapter of growth in the Altenar story.“ John Quaye, CFO at Altenar</p>
<p>According to him, the post-COVID landscape pushed the need for office spaces that are designed in a unique and efficient way. Finally, Quaye said that the office area is developed in such a way that it enables employees to interact with each other, sharing ideas and thoughts that can ultimately result in innovative solutions.</p>
<p>According to Altenar, the new office will be led by Quaye, who is an industry expert with solid experience in the financial and gaming verticals. It was last year in July when he first joined Altenar, bringing a wide range of knowledge and experience.</p>
