<p>The Dutch gaming authority has enacted new regulations suspending the use of limited-time offers to better protect vulnerable consumers who may be at risk of gambling harm.</p>
<p>Dutch Regulators Suspends Limited-Time and Exclusive Gambling Bonuses</p>
<p>The Kansspelautoriteit ( KSA) has announced that any bonuses advertised as “only today”, “for quick decision-makers” as well as “happy hour” are being officially banned under a new set of restrictions adopted by the regulator and already submitted to the European Commission for approval. Any ads promising financial benefits and “happiness” to clients would be removed as well.</p>
<p>Advertising should not encourage clients to seek gambling as a solution to their financial problems, In addition, adverts must be clear about the consequences of losing. As a result, the only ads that can be aired from now on would be those ads that promote legal products.</p>
<p>Other rules coming into effect include those focusing on protecting players from any false advertising premises leading players to believe they can have any impact on the game or influence it in any way.</p>
<p>Additionally, the KSA wants to uproot commercial influence over vulnerable and young people, which is why control over ads on social media and the TV channels is going to be strictly monitored.</p>
<p>The KSA has been working hard to protect gamblers. Earlier this year, the regulator advocated for self-exclusion and stemmed lobbying attempts by iGaming and gambling operators.</p>
<p>Licensee Have to Guarantee Player Protection</p>
<p>Licensees are no longer able to use the status of their license as an advertising tool beyond “the neutral statement that a license holder has a permit under the law”.</p>
<p>They must check and make sure of any risk the games offered by them hold and clarify those risks to their players.</p>
<p>Based on the new regulations the licensees must step in if the player “can no longer bear the financial consequences”, “recoup his losses”, “risk his job, application for debt restructuring, or need for addiction treatment”. Moreover, licensees must report what addiction prevention methods they use to the KSA.</p>
<p>“License holders must generously care for their players and make sure to prevent any signs of gambling addiction. Exactly because such preventions weren’t handled thoughtfully, an active addiction prevention policy is necessary now.” –Kansspelautoriteit</p>
<p>Due to COVID-19, the official date scheduled for the rules to come into effect is going to be moved from July 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021.</p>
<p>The European Commission has already been notified by the Dutch government of the changes in the rules. Except for the prevention policy, there is another rule included – a maximum credit allowance to be set for players.</p>
<p>The regulator used this opportunity to reveal further details concerning licensee record holding, reporting requirements, and technical standards.</p>
<p>The KSA fears that under current regulations, licensees may not be meeting all requirements necessary to protect all players who visit casinos and gambling centers.</p>
<p>This is why a change was needed in the rules so that safety is guaranteed and misappropriations are going to be avoided. The KSA and Dutch government have been in the habit of dishing out hefty penalties to wrongdoers.</p>
