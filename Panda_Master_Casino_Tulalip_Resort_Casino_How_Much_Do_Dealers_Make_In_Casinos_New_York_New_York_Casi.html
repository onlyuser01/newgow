    <h1>Panda Master Casino Tulalip Resort Casino How Much Do Dealers Make In Casinos New York New York Casi</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First of all, I am unpleasantly surprised by the situation they have created. I kindly ask you to reconsider your response to my requests, taking into consideration the following:</p>
<p>I am a Romanian citizen and a dentist. I am currently working in France for a period of 6 months and I plan to return to Romania at the end of the summer, in case I choose not to extend my activity here.</p>
<p>I have sent you the KYC verification documents and you have validated them (driver's license and proof of address from France), because being connected from an IP in France, I considered it correct to send you these documents. However, I have attached my Romanian ID card and passport if you need them, as well as proof of address from Romania. Therefore, I am a Romanian citizen working in France for a determined period.</p>
<p>It is absurd that you have confirmed many times that the documents are in order and have validated them, if you had this aspect regarding the fact that I would be a French citizen in your terms and conditions. You should have informed me since you verified the documents that I cannot continue my gambling activity on this platform, not let me make deposits and play.</p>
<p>You have approved a withdrawal of USD 2,500 on a certain date, which I have already received. After that I thought that blizz.io is safe to play and I have deposited another 3000 usd in Trx currency. So, at that time, you have approved this withdrawal because you discovered that I am not a French citizen, as you claim now. Therefore, it is excluded for you to confiscate my funds and refuse to approve the withdrawals.</p>
<p>I kindly ask you to consider changing your approach towards me, as I have all the evidence and information I need to appeal to a lawyer in this matter, who can take over this situation. I repeat, you have validated my account and have already approved a withdrawal, it is not like it was another platform, it is still you. Therefore, I am waiting for your response.</p>
