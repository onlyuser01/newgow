<p>Stakelogic Live, an innovative iGaming provider of premium casino games, has strengthened its leadership team by acquiring Richard Walker.</p>
<p>Walker Will Help the Company Distinguish Itself</p>
<p>Walker will step into the shoes of Stakelogic’s new head of live casino. As such, he will use his vast experience to help the company enhance its offerings and improve its online table games. Walker will oversee the production and distribution of the company’s titles and help Stakelogic Live expand its business.</p>
<p>By acquiring Walker, Stakelogic Live has secured itself a distinguished worker with 25 years of experience within the gambling sector. The new appointee has worked for several gambling companies. His past jobs include being Rank Group’s head of live casino for four years after a two-year stint as the company’s live casino product manager. Before joining Rank Group, Walker held several roles in Evolution Gaming, having served as its deputy head of operations Malta, head of international department, and deputy’s head.</p>
<p>As a part of Stakelogic Live, Walker will team up with Anthony Sammut and Sanita Gabriel who work as the company’s head of studios and head of operations respectively. The three of them will manage Stakelogic Live’s business as it quickly grows thanks to its strategic partnership deals.</p>
<p>Walker Says Joining Stakelogic Live Was an Easy Decision</p>
<p>Walker shared that he is delighted to join a company that has a genuine desire to grow within the live casino sector and usher in innovation. While Stakelogic Live is much younger than some of its competitors, the new head of live casino is sure it has the potential to be one of the best in the business. Walker added that it didn’t take him much time to agree to join the company:</p>
<p>“There is a fantastic team already in place here and it was an easy decision to join Stakelogic Live to continue the excellent progression already made along with driving the business forward and into the future.” Stakelogic Live Casino team lead Richard Walker</p>
<p>Stephan van den Oetelaar, the chief executive officer of Stakelogic, also spoke on the acquisition. He welcomed Walker as ahead of live casino and said that he is sure that the whole company will benefit from his “unrivaled experience and knowledge.”</p>
<p>Oetelaar emphasized that Stakelogic Live has quickly established itself on the market but is looking forward to expanding its business on an international scale:</p>
<p>“Stakelogic Live has achieved a great deal in a short space of time but under Richard’s leadership we will undoubtedly be able to hit our goal of becoming the number one provider of live casino content in markets across Europe and beyond.”</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s motto is to “think bigger.” True to its words, the company continues to pursue expansion and innovation.</p>
