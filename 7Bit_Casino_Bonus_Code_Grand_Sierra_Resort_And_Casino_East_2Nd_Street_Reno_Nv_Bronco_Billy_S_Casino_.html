<p>German land-based slots operator The Gauselmann Group is on the road to recovery after the pandemic. The company recorded a revenue of €1.746 billion for the first half of this year. The figure is about the same as the €1.74 billion for the same period in 2019. It is the first time Gauselmann has exceeded its pre-COVID numbers, which bodes well for the operator’s long-term recovery.</p>
<p>International Revenue Was Paramount to Success</p>
<p>Gauselmann’s international expansion efforts were a primary factor for its renewed growth. Approximately 60% of the company’s revenue comes from its investments abroad. Spain and the UK have been the most successful in that regard, and the operator is keen to continue this trend to lessen its dependence on individual markets.</p>
<p>Paul Gauselmann, founder and Management Board Chairman of The Gauselmann Group, attributed the company’s recovery to its employees’ hard work, dedication, and camaraderie. He explained that the company had lost close to €2bn in lost sales revenues and had to close its nearly 1000 outlets for about nine months. However, Gauselmann was optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>It is great news that the pandemic has bottomed out, and we are finally back in charted territory again. Paul Gauselmann, founder and Chairman of The Gauselmann Group</p>
<p>Expanding in the Casino Business Was a Surprising Win</p>
<p>The operator’s diversification in the casino business was another factor that fueled its post-pandemic recovery. Gauselmann has invested heavily into the German casino segment since 2021, and these efforts are starting to pay dividends. The company recorded an exponential increase in visitors at its land-based casinos. Its venues in Saxony-Anhalt experienced the most significant boom, but the operator’s other properties in Berlin, Rhineland-Palatinate, and North Rhine-Westphalia are also enjoying success.</p>
<p>“I have never experienced such a percentage rise in any other sector so far.”</p>

<p>The operator’s booming international and casino business is also reflected on its staff. In 2021, the number of employees increased by 10.7%. Gauselmann now employs nearly 15,000 people across its European venues.</p>
<p>German Gambling Reforms Bring Uncertainty</p>
<p>According to Gauselmann, the company has managed to attract players who were previously engaged with illegal gambling offerings and protect them from the associated risks. However, he noted that Germany’s recent regulatory changes had been overly strict and made legal gaming offerings less appealing. Land-based venues put even lower caps on the number of gaming machines, and the severe restrictions even led to the closure of many arcades. Gauselmann is nevertheless determined to uphold its standards despite the difficult conditions.</p>
<p>The operator is also exploring Germany’s recently legalized online gambling as another avenue for growth. Its subsidiary, Mernov, achieved the first online casino license in the country. According to Gauselmann, the company had good ideas about its potential contributions to the online segment. The 65-year-old patriarch expressed hope that future success was within reach, provided the operator continued its good performance.</p>
