<p>Krazy Klimber review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Krazy Klimber is themed around references to the 1933 King Kong film.</p>
<p>Players will enter a glamorous world with plenty of old Hollywood flair. In the glow of theatrical search lights, they’ll encounter a giant gorilla and a bodacious damsel in distress.</p>
<p>This slot may appeal to vintage film lovers and fans of the art deco period.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The jazzy soundtrack gives Krazy Klimber a distinctly vintage vibe. The reels spin and chime with familiar sound effects, giving the gameplay a classic feel as well.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see New York City far below them. Breathlessly, they’ll realise that they are high up a building along with the titular gorilla. Search lights drift through the sky, adding further drama.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will find vintage cameras, war planes, and a fearful Kong-like gorilla. This primate anti-hero looks more cute than fierce, and many players will likely be on his side.</p>
<p>A busty heroine also appears, her eyes wide with shock as if she has just met the massive primate. She doesn’t challenge any stereotypes and looks rather helpless in the face of danger.</p>
<p>The game is accented with geometric art deco designs. This visual style influences the fonts and letters of the lower paying symbols as well.</p>
<p>Overall, the music and graphics combine to create a vintage cinematic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Krazy Klimber is a five reel, three row slot with 20 win lines.</p>
<p>The gameplay is smooth and fast, allowing players to stay engaged.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>The Climb feature is triggered when Bonus symbols land on reels 1, 3, and 5. During this feature, the ape will climb up the tower and award players a cash prize or a number of free spins.</p>
<p>Should the Climb feature end on a Free Spins section, players will receive 10 or 20 free spins. During this feature, each free spin will have at least one Super Wild land, substituting for all other symbols.</p>
<p>The only bonus feature of the game</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.1%, just about our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low-medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its average RTP and low-medium volatility, we do not recommend Krazy Climber.</p>
<p>Despite a visually-appealing theme, this slot’s volatility holds it back from being an optimal choice for strategy-minded players.</p>
<p>The bonus features are not numerous, but still fun and engaging.</p>
<p>Some players who are less concerned with strategy may especially enjoy visiting Krazy Klimber to enjoy the art deco world.</p>
