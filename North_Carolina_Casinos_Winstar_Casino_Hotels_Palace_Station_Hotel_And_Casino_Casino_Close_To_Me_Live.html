    <h1>North Carolina Casinos Winstar Casino Hotels Palace Station Hotel And Casino Casino Close To Me Live</h1>

<p>hi good day</p>
<p>trust you are well. I have made the following withdrawal process of R2800 according to me and trading through the terms and conditions I could do an withdrawal,</p>
<p>I made a deposit precious to my winnings with my free spins I have wagered the requirements on it. My documents were sent and approved for verification.</p>
<p>after do an withdrawal to which I could and was only allowed to withdraw using two options it's was Bitcoin,ecopay,and neller..... After my 5 waiting period of 5 working business days they come back saying that my withdrawal prices has been rejected due to the fact that another deposit on my side has to be made of R350.</p>
<p>I asked what happened to my withdrawal amount will my account be credited again with the same rand value, im still awaiting there response.</p>
<p>I'm so furious right now, as per my mails back and fourth I was open enough to ask</p>
<p>what is the process after the withdrawal request so I could gain a better understanding of how they do things in there side, I leased well enough to make this withdraw a pleasant and successful one and was very co-operative..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>please see below a copy of the final email they sent.</p>
<p>We hope this email finds you well.Please note that your payout request has been declined due to the fact that, as per our Withdrawal Guidelines, "You can cash out winnings from free bonus money if you have at least a minimum deposit of 350 ZAR made in the last 5 days before placing the payout request."There is no deposit registered on your account during the past 5 days, therefore, your current winnings are not redeemable.Please feel free to make another deposit at your earliest convenience and then resubmit your withdrawal request in the system.Thank you for your understanding in the matter. If you need any help please do not hesitate to contact us, we will gladly assist you.Regards,</p>
