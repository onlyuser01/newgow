<p>Stake.com, a global powerhouse in gaming and betting, has grown its presence in the esports betting vertical with the company teaming up with Oddin.gg. Oddin.gg is a leading specialist in the provision of esports odds feed services and tailor-made risk management solutions, the company confirmed in a press release.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg has been a long-standing household name in the fairly new vertical, with the esports betting ecosystem enjoying a resurgence over the past several years, bolstered by both the arrival of powerful technological suppliers and operator ingenuity.</p>
<p>As a result of the latest collaboration, Oddin.gg will provide Stake.com with its esports odds feed, iFrame solution, innovative and consumer-focused widgets, risk management options, and round-the-clock content and services that will help Stake.comâ€™s esports product grow and reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Stake.com and Oddin.gg are confident that esports are not just resurgent, but they are here to stay, as the sector grows. They are not remiss, with the adoption of esports betting becoming more common among top-tier operators. Many companies, including Oddin.gg and Rivalry.gg, have crafted successful products centered entirely on the segment.</p>
<p>Stake.com Director of Operations Dominic Hardcastle has welcomed the opportunity to see his company continue to evolve and develop in what has clearly become an important pillar of the industry and admitted that Stake had to play some catch-up in light of the rapid adoption of esports betting solutions.</p>
<p>"The selection of Oddin.gg was straightforward, given their expertise and perfect range of products for our purposes. Our new partnership with Oddin.gg will help us double down on our investment in esports crypto betting," Hardcastle explained.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg Co-founder &amp; Managing Director, PartnershipsMarek Suchar was similarly happy with the development and said that he was excited to have the opportunity to work with the crypto brand. Suchar confirmed that Stake.com has shown the same interest Oddin.gg expresses in advancing and improving the esports betting experience and bringing better level of engagement for everyone.</p>
<p>There have been other success stories in the segment. PandaScore recently was picked by prominent gaming brand Betfred to help the operator enhance its esports betting offer as well. Regulation of esports betting has been a hot topic in the United States where legislators are taking a closer look at making this vertical part of the standard gambling framework when regulating or expanding existing regulation.</p>
