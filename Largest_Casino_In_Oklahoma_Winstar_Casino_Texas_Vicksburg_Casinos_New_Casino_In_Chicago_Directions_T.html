    <h1>Largest Casino In Oklahoma Winstar Casino Texas Vicksburg Casinos New Casino In Chicago Directions T</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, we are not in a position to ask for a refund if the casino wasn't aware of your gambling problem prior to making the first deposit. This is a standard practice in Curacao-licensed casinos and we cannot penalize this specific casino for not closing your account automatically.</p>
<p>If you still have access to your casino account and you want to close it, my best advice would be to request self-exclusion again and properly this time. When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible. I would also strongly recommend that you always save your self-exclusion request so that you have a valid proof of such action.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings xxx xxx,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx (gambling addiction/problem)</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to the casino support and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
