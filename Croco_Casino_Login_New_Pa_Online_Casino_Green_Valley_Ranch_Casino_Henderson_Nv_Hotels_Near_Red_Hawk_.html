<p>In a ground-breaking operation, NetEnt has become the first non-proprietary vendor to roll out its products in West Virginia.</p>
<p>NetEnt Rolls Games as the First Non-Proprietary Game Studio in WV</p>
<p>NetEnt has released a selection of games in West Virginia as the first non-proprietary casino vendor in the state and following successful technical integration with DraftKings as per an approval from the West Virginia Lottery Commission.</p>
<p>The company continues to expand its clout in the United States, bringing forth a portfolio of globally-acclaimed products, and specifically Starburst, Gonzo’s Quest, Jack and the Beanstalk and others.</p>
<p>NetEnt is already a leading supplier in essential markets such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, two of the earliest adopters of online gaming solutions in the country.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, NetEnt reported that it had integrated successfully with DraftKings, expanding the betting and gambling firm’s portfolio by adding industry-acclaimed slots to the company’s digital operation in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Just this week, NetEnt proceeded with a live launch on the PlayLive! online casino operated by Cordish Companies, adding traditional slot games and progressive jackpot games, including Divine Fortune.</p>
<p>NetEnt continues to partner with DraftKings as a pivot of its further expansion in the United States. Commenting on the latest development in a press release, NetEnt Americas LLC Vice President Commercial, Brian Kraft, said that the company was excited to be the first third-party vendor to lay its mark on West Virginia’s market.</p>
<p>Kraft confirmed that the company is bringing on some of its most successful and popular titles from New Jersey and Pennsylvania to West Virginia as a result. NetEnt’s has been on a tear, signing a multi-year partnership with Gaming Realms to transform one of its leading slots, Starburst, into a slingo title.</p>
<p>NetEnt has recently become one of the staple suppliers for SG Digital’s OpenGaming platform. The move allows NetEnt to consolidate its presence in the US market and expand with the help of Scientific Games’ growing popularity in the country.</p>
<p>NetEnt also announced a partnership with BetMGM, a Roar Digital brand, in West Virginia. In Pennsylvania, the company boosted its presence with a new deal with Wind Creek. NetEnt has stayed true to its tradition of securing high-profile deals across the entire United States.</p>
<p>The company joined hands with Tipico, a Germans sports betting brand, to help the operator secure a smoother rollout in New Jersey. Tipico has opted for NetEnt’s vast portfolio of slot and table games to strengthen its ground-breaking operations in America.</p>
<p>NetEnt’s American push continues.</p>
