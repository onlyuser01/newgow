    <h1>Philadelphia Ms Casino Foxwoods Casinos Foxwoods Casino Shows Encore Casinos Perchanga Casino Bit4Wi</h1>

<p>Dear Bit4Win Casino team,</p>
<p>When exactly did the casino stop accepting Russian players, please? Were Russian players allowed to play in the casino at the time the player registered and accumulated his disputed winnings?</p>
<p>Can you provide me with the player's game logs and transaction history?</p>
<p>Is the restriction for Russian players stated anywhere on the casino website? If yes, where could I find it?</p>
<p>Why does the casino's CS inform players that VPN and playing from Russia are allowed? If a player uses VPN (which is likely allowed in Bit4Win Casino), the casino CS also confirms it, and in case it is not stated anywhere on the casino website - how can a player find out that they are not allowed to register and play from Russia, please?</p>
<p>The information on the screenshot of the live chat conversation was provided by the casino CS more than 2 weeks after the issue arose and this complaint was made.</p>
<p>Also, I am afraid my questions above have not been answered, so I would like to repeat them once again.</p>
<p>"Does the casino accept using VPN?</p>
<p>Even if the casino changed its rules, for any reason, players should have been somehow informed about such a change. Or, they should have been provided with the option to withdraw their balances before their accounts will be blocked/closed. Did anything like this happen?</p>
<p>If the player was allowed to play, the casino should be also able to pay his winnings. What should be the reason for winnings confiscation?</p>
<p>Would the casino be able to make a manual withdrawal? If yes, what needs to be done on the player's side to withdraw the disputed funds?"</p>
<p>It is possible to share the details directly here, with your reply, or by sending them to my email address (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
