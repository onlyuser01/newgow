<p>After a two week respite college football starts its postseason with six bowl games on Saturday featuring some universities even hardcore fans or bettors might not know.</p>

<p>The first six games kick off the bowl season that will see a total of 39 contests over the next 16 days.</p>
<p>The Cure, Camellia and Celebration Bowl won’t be confused with the Cotton, Orange or Rose Bowl anytime soon. Many people might not know where New Orleans Bowl participant Troy University is located. It’s in Alabama.</p>
<p>The initial six might not be as compelling or thrilling to television viewers, but they do provide some wagering opportunities on college football that should keep bettors interested.</p>
<p>Below are capsules of Saturday’s games.</p>
<p>First Three</p>
<p>Celebration Bowl North Carolina A&amp;T vs. Grambling State</p>
<p>This is the first time the two will meet since 1997 and Grambling holds a 4-3 edge against the Aggies. The Tigers won last year’s Celebration Bowl, but will face an undefeated North Carolina A&amp;T squad, who are favored anywhere from 7 ½ to 8 ½ points. The over/under is 51 ½. Grambling State coach Broderick Fobbs knows his opponent will be motivated to complete an undefeated season and capture the black college national championship.</p>
<p>“You’re talking about two storied programs that understand the importance of putting football in its rightful place and giving it what it needs in order to be successful,” he said.</p>
<p>New Orleans Bowl Troy vs. North Texas</p>
<p>Even though these two are in different conferences now they are quite familiar with one another. The Mean Green used to be in the Sun Belt Conference and has faced Troy 10 previous times only winning twice. They are underdogs again at seven points. A high-scoring affair is expected as the over/under opened at 60 points and quickly jumped to 62 ½.</p>
<p>Cure Bowl Georgia State vs. Western Kentucky</p>
<p>This might be the weakest of the day’s games as both teams barely squeaked into bowl eligibility. Western Kentucky is favored by 6 ½ and the over/under is 53. Both have high-powered offenses and like to throw the ball, so it should be entertaining.</p>
<p>Last Three</p>
<p>Las Vegas Bowl No. 25 Boise State vs. Oregon</p>
<p>This is the only game of the day that features a team in the AP Top 25 and the Broncos are not happy they didn’t get invited to a better contest. They also can’t be pleased that sports books have them as a 7-point underdog. Oregon is a notch below fellow Pac 12 competitor Washington State, which BSU played on the road and only lost by three. The over/under is 61.</p>
<p>New Mexico Bowl Marshall vs. Colorado State</p>
<p>Both of these teams started the season strong and then limped home and would like to redeem its year. The Rams have the nation’s 10th best offense, while Marshall is ranked No. 25 defensively. CSU is giving away 5 ½ points and the over/under is 58.</p>
<p>Camellia Bowl Middle Tennessee vs. Arkansas State</p>
<p>The Blue Raiders quarterback Brent Stockstill is the son of Middle Tennessee Coach Rick Stockstill. He was plagued with injuries most of the season but is healthy now and can lite up a scoreboard. The Red Wolves are favored, though, at 3 ½ points. The over/under is 62.</p>
