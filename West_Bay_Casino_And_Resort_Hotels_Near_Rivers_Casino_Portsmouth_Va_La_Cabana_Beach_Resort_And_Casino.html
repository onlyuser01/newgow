    <h1>West Bay Casino And Resort Hotels Near Rivers Casino Portsmouth Va La Cabana Beach Resort And Casino</h1>

<p>BetGames has expanded its geographical reach once again with the developer of innovative live dealer casino content and betting games consolidating its presence in South Africa through a partnership with local operator LulaBet.</p>
<p>The partnership will allow LulaBet to launch a number of BetGames’ excellent titles that are designed to provide players with unmatched experiences and games that feature professionally trained live dealers, betting games, and a fantastic Wheel of Fortune game.</p>
<p>BetGames Happy to Bolster LulaBet’s Market Offer</p>
<p>LulaBet operates out of Cape Town, and it covers both the casino and sports betting verticals. It is keen on enhancing its portfolio with a number of world-class products that can help the company secure its position in the market. The same goes for BetGames which is keen to increase its exposure to the South African and African gaming markets as a whole.</p>
<p>This announcement comes at the same time that ESA Gaming revealed that it’s going to power 888AFRICA’s brands in the region as well today. 888AFRICA has already rolled out the 888bet brand in four regional markets. BetGames VP of sales Africa James Everett welcomed this new opportunity and said that Africa is an important market for the company. He also welcomed the collaboration with LulaBet:</p>
<p>We’re also delighted to have agreed a deal with LulaBet, a new player in our industry and one which we believe will accomplish many great things in the fast-developing South African market. BetGames VP of sales Africa James Everett</p>
<p>LulaBet managing director Iain Gutteridge was also pleased with the partnership opportunity and said that it was an important milestone for LulaBet as well. He assured that the brand is fully committed to bringing players the best possible quality products and that the content partnership with BetGames is an important step forward. This is what Gutteridge added when commenting about BetGames and LulaBet’s own ambitions for the African market:</p>
<p>The studio’s titles have established themselves across Africa as one of the continent’s best performers. Therefore, we knew that this deal was a no-brainer and thus we’ve gained content from one of the most familiar iGaming brands in Africa. LulaBet managing director Iain Gutteridge</p>
<p>Just earlier this month, BetGames announced another similar expansion in Africa through Sahara Games Technology Corporation.</p>
