<p>Air Dice Group, a leading developer of highly entertaining money games, has reinforced its leadership with a new addition. The experienced Erkki Nikunen will join the company as a partner and chief business development officer and will leverage his experience to help the Finnish company grow.</p>
<p>Air Dice Reinforces Its Leadership</p>
<p>Nikunen is an iGaming professional with years of experience within the gaming industry. He has worked for some notable local companies, including Paf, one of the oldest gaming companies in Finland and one of the first companies to digitalize its offerings. As a member of Paf, Nikunen worked as a customer relations manager and later as a player intelligence manager.</p>
<p>In 2013, Nikunen joined Finnplay, another local gambling leader. At first, he served as a vice president of sales before being promoted to chief commercial officer two years later. In 2018, Finnplay named Nikunen as chief marketing officer – a position he maintained for over three years.</p>
<p>Nikunen is also one of the founding partners of Fortuity Holdings, the brand behind LuckyCasino.com.</p>
<p>As chief business development officer of Air Dice, Nikunen will be responsible for helping the brand grow and cement itself as a leading force in the Finnish market. During his tenure at Finnplay, the appointee had the chance to team up with Air Dice. As a result, he already knows its team and is well-informed about the content Air Dice produces.</p>
<p>Nikunen Was Welcomed to the Team</p>
<p>Nikunen said that he is very happy to join Air Dice’s team and praised the company for its incredible track record and high-quality products. He noted that the provider is famed for its action-packed gaming products and a high-tech approach that sets it apart from its competition. Because of this, Nikunen said, joining Air Dice was an easy choice. He said he is looking forward to working with the team and assisting with the company’s development.</p>
<p>Sami Mäkinen, chief executive of Air Dice, lauded Nikunen as an experienced gambling industry worker who has extensive experience within the sector. According to Mäkinen, the new appointee’s knowledge of sales and marketing will be crucial to realizing Air Dice’s growth plan.</p>
<p>Speaking of Finland, the country is considering reforms to its gambling system amid high black market activity. As more and more players abandon the legal offer in favor of unlicensed gambling activities, Finland realized the need to evolve. The Nordic country will likely dissolve Veikkaus’s gambling monopoly and may adopt a system similar to Sweden’s.</p>
