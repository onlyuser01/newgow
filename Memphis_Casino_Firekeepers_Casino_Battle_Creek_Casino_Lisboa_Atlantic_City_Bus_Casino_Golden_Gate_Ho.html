    <h1>Memphis Casino Firekeepers Casino Battle Creek Casino Lisboa Atlantic City Bus Casino Golden Gate Ho</h1>

<p>Douglas, Isle of Man may soon enjoy a new £30m development that will also feature a casino, BBC News reported.</p>
<p>A proposal has been submitted to detail a complex that will include a bingo hall, car parking spaces, 25 apartments, offices, and more and the development site, owned by the Manx Government, is at Fort Street, Lord Street, Walpole Avenue and Victoria Street.</p>
<p>The casino project will see the Palace Hotel &amp; Casino relocate to the new site, not that a new license would be issued per se. The bingo hall is not the only gambling activity that could be potentially hosted out of the site, as there will also be a sports bar and a casino on the first floor, the media details.</p>
<p>To make this happen an approval from the government would be needed, and if granted – the Palace Hotel &amp; Casino will be relocating to the new site from Douglas Promenade where it currently operates.</p>
<p>The new venue is to be developed by ADG Architects, which will combine a civic space along with other amenities and activities, transforming the site into a "central hub." The public spaces will be accessible to everyone, according to the architects and serve to reinvigorate the specific area of the city as well.</p>
<p>As to the design, it will have elements of both hard and soft landscaping and a general focus on functionality as well as form. Presently, Isle of Man does not have a big gambling industry, although it’s often used as companies connected to the sector who prefer to headquarter themselves in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Palace Hotel &amp; Casino is presently the only land-based option for residents who wish to gamble in-person. Isle of Man also issues licenses to gambling companies and has long been associated with the gambling industry, although it has never been interested in developing land-based casino resorts on its territory.</p>
