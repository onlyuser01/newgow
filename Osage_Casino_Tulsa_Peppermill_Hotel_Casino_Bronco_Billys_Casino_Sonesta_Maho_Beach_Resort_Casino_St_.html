<p>The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) recently suspended the UK gaming license for In Touch Games Limited (ITG). The operator, which manages several online gaming platforms, failed to adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulations for several years.</p>

<p>The UKGC has raised concerns about the company’s failure to adhere to its mandate, which includes ensuring fair and transparent procedures, preventing money laundering, and reporting suspicious activities.</p>
<p>The suspension targets ITG’s remote bingo, casino, and gaming software license. The suspension, according to the UKGC’s announcement, follows a thorough review in accordance with the UK’s Gambling Act 2005. It highlighted serious concerns regarding the company’s operations after repeatedly receiving warnings and fines since 2019.</p>
<p>The suspension covers ITG’s cashmo.co.uk, casino2020.co.uk, casino.mfortune.co.uk, bonusboss.co.uk, mfortune.co.uk, mrspin.co.uk, drslot.co.uk, slotfactory.com, jammymonkey.com and pocketwin.co.uk platforms. While the operator can’t conduct activity, the sites aren’t going to go dark. The UKGC ordered ITG to keep sites active so users can access their accounts.</p>
<p>There’s a significant history between ITG and the UKGC. In 2019, it had to pay a £2.2-million (US$2.76 million) settlement for violating regulatory statutes. A settlement is simply a play on semantics to avoid using the word “fine.”</p>
<p>In 2021, the company was fined £3.4-million (US$4.26 million) It received another bill for violations this year. Following an investigation from March 2022, it paid a fine of £6.1 million (US$7.65 million) this past January.</p>
<p>Betfred Fined for Lack of Safeguards</p>
<p>Betfred also received a fine from UKGV of £3.25 million (US$4.25 million) a month ago due to various acts of non-compliance.</p>
<p>According to official records, Betfred lacked adequate safeguards for its new customers. These offenses, which include the inability to effectively oversee customers’ spending limits and gaming time, occurred between January 2021 and December 2022.</p>
<p>As of May, the regulator has collected £50.7 million (US$62.65 million) in fines and settlements. This was before the other recent fines and settlements, and the UKGC is beginning to appear as though it might beat last year’s figure come December.</p>
