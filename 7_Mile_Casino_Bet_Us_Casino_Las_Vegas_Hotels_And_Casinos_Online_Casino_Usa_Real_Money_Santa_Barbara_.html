    <h1>7 Mile Casino Bet Us Casino Las Vegas Hotels And Casinos Online Casino Usa Real Money Santa Barbara</h1>

<p>Betboo casino acts in bad faith as it seduces the customer into depositing the amount of 200 BRL to receive 20 free spins worth TEN CENTS per spin. This equates to 1% of the deposited amount.</p>
<p>I have always deposited less than that, keeping an average of 100 BRL per deposit. With this offer, I decided to deposit 200 BRL in order to insure myself in case of losses with the 20 free spins. After losing the 200 BRL, I went to open the free spins and found that it was 20 free spins worth 0.10 BRL, that is, TEN cents.</p>
<p>The game is Magicians Secret's by Pragmatic Play. The detail is that the minimum bet in BRL is 0.50 BRL. They manage to give us spins at a value LOWER than the minimum possible to be played.</p>
<p>This is totally against the responsible gaming and fair gaming policy, as it would influence the customer to deposit a high amount to receive the 20 free spins that correspond to 1% of the deposited amount, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>They don't respond to emails, they just drag us around in chat until they stop responding, in addition to having BIZARRE Portuguese errors.</p>
<p>I want to know if Betboo thinks it's right to seduce customers in order to receive a high amount and then make fun of them with a counterpart of 1% of the deposited amount.</p>
<p>As soon as they answer me, I'll attach the entire chat, where they often hang up the conversation or even stop responding.</p>
