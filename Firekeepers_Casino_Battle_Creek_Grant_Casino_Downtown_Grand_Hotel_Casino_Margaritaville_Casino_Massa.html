    <h1>Firekeepers Casino Battle Creek Grant Casino Downtown Grand Hotel Casino Margaritaville Casino Massa</h1>

<p>I will see if there's an agent available, please leave more details</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>Withdrawals are being cancelled again.</p>
<p>Wasn't it you who asked me to take out $1000 each?</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
<p>Gabby says:</p>
<p>Hi, how are you?</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us today and sending us the information.</p>
<p>My name is Gabby, how can we help you?</p>
<p>I says:</p>

<p>Gabby</p>
<p>Gabby says:</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I saw our team has suggested withdrawing 1000 USD each one, and it was rejected, I am aware of your case and I will request more information so we can check why it was not approved.</p>
<p>I will be back with updates as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>I don't want to make many complaints here either. Please do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p>December 29 at 12:48 AM</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
<p>Gabby says:</p>
<p>Sure, I completely understand. I am just waiting for an update on my end.</p>

<p>Answer Bot says:</p>
<p>How did your chat go?</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
<p>Gabby says:</p>
<p>Hi, I am back.</p>
<p>I saw in the previous chat that Alex suggested you to request a withdrawal of 1000 USD via crypto 1. I think there was a misunderstanding, because it was requested 2x 1000 USD, if the first is not approved or analysed yet, the system rejects it, because it can be a mistake, so the amounts must be different (1000 USD and 1001 USD for example), or you can withdraw twice the 1000 USD, however requesting the second one after the first withdrawal is sent.</p>
<p>Let me know how you would like to proceed, and once you request the new withdrawal that I will try getting it approved today.</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>i want withdrawl in USDT(TRC20)</p>
<p>December 29 at 1:38 AM</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
<p>Gabby says:</p>
<p>Oh, I see. Unfortunately, at the moment, USDC via ERC20 is the only option available to send the funds.</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>not USDC, but USDT</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>No other wallets.</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>Why are you choosing a withdrawal method that is not available in the first place?</p>
<p>I don't have time to do this either.</p>
<p>December 29 at 8:46 PM</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>I created a USDC wallet as you suggested, changed the amount and applied for a withdrawal, but was denied again.</p>
<p>I am fed up.</p>
<p>December 29 at 9:59 PM</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
<p>Gabby says:</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you. I just saw here and received the updates, since you mentioned the availability of the payment method, I have forwarded the comment as well. We do apologise for the inconvenience but the USDC is the only option at the moment.</p>
<p>I also checked the request of 998USD that was rejected. I can't access further details, but asked for information and also mentioned you already requested a new amount, I will do everything as possible to have it approved today.</p>
<p>December 29 at 10:17 PM</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>I applied for withdrawal at USDC.</p>
<p>But it has been denied.</p>
<p>Please explain the reason.</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
<p>Gabby says:</p>
<p>Yes, I saw that, and I can see it was rejected as well. I do not have more details but I have already requested the reason as well, and the approval of your last request.</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>Can I just change the value to $1000, $999, $998 and withdraw anyway?</p>
<p>January 3 at 12:35 PM</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>Withdrawals are also being denied. That's enough.</p>
<p>January 3 at 9:59 PM</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
<p>Gabby says:</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I reported your withdrawals being declined to our team, however we didn't have any updates yet and the team is investigating why so we can help you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your comprehension and patience so far, we are working intensely to bring you answers and help you with the withdrawals as soon as possible.</p>
<p>January 4 at 2:51 AM</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>It's too late. We have reported the matter to an outside agency and you will have to explain it to them.</p>
<p>New</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
<p>Gabby says:</p>
<p>Sure, I understand. I will keep working from here, let me know if I can help with anything else in the meantime.</p>
