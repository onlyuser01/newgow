<p>NuxGame, a B2B provider of iGaming and sports betting solutions, has unveiled a new gaming solution called White Label. The novel addition will help the provider power its clients across the world with casino and sportsbook platforms.</p>

<p>White Label is powered with all kinds of tools operators might need. The platform is fully-equipped with NuxGame’s proprietary tech and compliance solutions. Therefore, partnering operators can step up their tech game and receive valuable advice on compliance and fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The highly-customizable platform provides a plethora of options to partnering operators. The latter can either fully customize their online casino and/or sportsbook product or alternatively pick from a list of preset templates. In addition, White Label users will get exclusive back office access and will be able to benefit from the platform’s flexible settings. Each of NuxGame’s partners can also access a personalized project manager and oversee the development of their gambling product.</p>
<p>NuxGame is known as a fast worker and promises that clients will receive their sportsbooks and online casinos within three months. The company fields a skilled and efficient team that knows how to fulfill a client’s wishes. The new White Label solution will make it even easier for NuxGame to produce high-quality customized products for its customers across Asia, LATAM, Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>The Company Provides Operators with Affordable yet High-Quality Products</p>
<p>NuxGame’s ambition is to produce quality sportsbooks and casinos that appeal to a wide range of operators. The company aims to tailor its products to the individual needs of its clients and produce content that is suitable for various regulated markets.</p>
<p>Bar Konson, NuxGame’s head of sales, noted that many trust his company and have high expectations from its products. As a result, NuxGame has become synonymous with solutions of supreme quality and exceptional customer service. Konson added that this is all made possible by the company’s experienced and talented team.</p>
<p>Speaking of White Label, Konson explained that the solution aims to provide clients with the ability to fully customize their casino and sportsbook platforms.</p>
<p>Our latest solution combines many different aspects of our business to provide ownership of a leading casino and sportsbook platform, with the ability to fully customize the design and user interface. We are truly excited to bring our client’s visions to life. Bar Konson, head of sales, NuxGame</p>
