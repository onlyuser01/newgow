    <h1>Georgia Casino Bitcoin Online Casino Free Casino Money Casino Glendale Az Casino Oregon Coast inbet</h1>

<p>Dear nelik6556,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casinoâ€™s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>Responsible Gambling Assistance</p>
<p>Self Exclusion</p>
<p>INBET offers customers the possibility to self-exclude from the offered services by filling out a Self Exclusion Request Form.</p>
<p>The Self-Exclusion Request Form can be provided by the INBET team via live chat or email. Our email address is support@inbet.com.</p>
<p>The Form needs to be printed out, filled out and signed by the account holder and a clearly legible copy (picture) must be sent to support@inbet.com or submitted via our live chat.</p>
<p>Each self-exclusion is applied for an indefinite period of time by default. All customers will have no less than 24 hours to complete any open bets and withdraw any funds available in their accounts. All bets that have not been completed at the time of the self-exclusion taking effect will remain open until the end of the respective events and their settlement.</p>
<p>A self-excluded account may be reactivated only after an explicit request has been filed by the account holder via chat or email. INBET reserves the right to decline account reactivation requests to persons vulnerable to developing a gambling addiction or persons who are included in the Vulnerable Persons List maintained by the National Revenue Agency (NRA). The reactivation of the above-mentioned accounts is possible only after the exclusion of the account holders from the respective lists.</p>
<p>All requests are processed within 7 business days.</p>
<p>Could you please ask for the Self Exclusion Request Form casino directly?</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
