<p>BetMGM has entered into a pivotal partnership with International Game Technology (IGT), introducing a dedicated branded casino for the company’s flagship and wildly popular jackpot game, Wheel of Fortune.</p>
<p>Aptly called, Wheel of Fortune Online Casino, the new online property has launched in New Jersey earlier this week, as confirmed by BetMGM and IGT in an official statement. This is a first for the brand, and the Wheel of Fortune Online Casino will focus on providing a new home to America’s Game-brandedslot games, along with new themes and features to explore at players’ leisure.</p>
<p>The website is already live and accessible as well. Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM’s Chief Executive Officer, hailed the rollout of the new casino property and said that the company was very excited about the opportunity to bring it forward to players in New Jersey. Local players of the legal age can play for real money and experience the original game show gameplay on their smartphones as they go.</p>
<p>"We have a great alliance with Wheel of Fortune and IGT and look forward to offering our players innovative and diverse selections of gaming options," Greenblatt added. The opportunity to see the Wheel of Fortune slots reach even more people through a new and unique proposition was similarly welcomed by IGT’s CEO of Digital &amp; Betting, Enrico Drago.</p>
<p>Drago said that he was excited to pack together some of the best Wheel of Fortunes slots and bring them to audiences that will surely appreciate them. He called this project "the evolution of this celebrated theme" and was excited to be teaming up with BetMGM to see it through to realization. Now, players have a casino where they can enjoy the full family of IGT Wheel of Fortune Slots games, he concluded.</p>
<p>The Wheel of Fortune Online Casino already features a number of games, along with jackpot slots, table games, exclusives, slots, and naturally, the Wheel of Fortune section where players will find many popular options. Those include Wheel of Fortune: Hawaiian Getaway, Wheel of Fortune: On the Road, and Wheel of Fortune: Winning Words Games, among many others.</p>
<p>The news was understandably also welcomed by SuzannePrete, the EVP of Game Shows at Sony Pictures Television, which produces the original Wheel of Fortune game show, and which has served as the basis of IGT’s acclaimed slot game.</p>
