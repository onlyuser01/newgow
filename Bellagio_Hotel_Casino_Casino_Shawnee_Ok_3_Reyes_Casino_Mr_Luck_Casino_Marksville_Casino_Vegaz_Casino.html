    <h1>Bellagio Hotel Casino Casino Shawnee Ok 3 Reyes Casino Mr Luck Casino Marksville Casino Vegaz Casino</h1>

<p>Dear mete121212,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding the relevant communication:</p>
<p>I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. Could you please advise if you redeemed this specific bonus in the past? When was the last time you placed a real money deposit, please?</p>
<p>I have checked the Saturday Booster terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>Only in the general bonus terms is mentioned that Saturday Booster requires a prior real money deposit during the previous week (here):</p>
<p>". Saturday Booster</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>4.6 To ensure proper use of bonuses and fair play, VegazCasino.com considers claiming Saturday Booster bonus without any other clean deposit (i.e. deposit which is not matched with any bonus) during the week as irregular gameplay to take advantage of bonuses. Players must deposit at least 150€ during the week in order to be eligible for winnings generated with Saturday Booster Bonuses if they later decide to play slot games with mentioned deposit and 300€ in case of table games play. In case of irregular play mentioned above, winnings generated with Saturday Booster will be forfeited and deposit returned."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize that if players are not eligible for a specific bonus, it shouldn't be available to them at all. Please check our article about Restricted Bonuses:</p>
<p>"Casinos should only give bonuses to players who are allowed to get them according to the Bonus T&amp;Cs. And if the casino makes the mistake of granting a bonus to a player who shouldn't have received it, the casino shouldn't take it away from them. Instead, the casino should accept that it was their mistake and pay out the winnings to the player."</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
