<p>Gaming technology and content supplier Inspired Entertainment announced today it was granted a gaming-related supplier license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).</p>
<p>Launch Expected in the Second Quarter</p>
<p>The gaming-related license granted by the AGCO authorized the company to offer its games to any gaming operator approved by the Canadian province’s gaming regulator to offer online casino games in the province.</p>
<p>“Ontario’s iGaming market officially opens to licensed operators on April 4th, 2022, and we couldn’t be more excited to be a part of the newly regulated iGaming market.” Claire Osborne, VP, Interactive, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Inspired is planning to launch its gaming content in Ontario in the second quarter of 2022 and believes it will have at least 25 games certified by that time. The supplier’s portfolio will feature some of its most popular titles, including Big Spin Bonus, Big Fishing Fortune and the retro classic Space Invaders.</p>
<p>“With a population of nearly 15 million people, Ontario’s demographics compare favorably to states like New Jersey or Michigan where we already operate. We expect Ontario to present a significant market opportunity for us, and we look forward to players in Ontario enjoying our games.” Claire Osborne, VP, Interactive, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>The authorization granted by the regulator in Ontario will allow Inspired to build on its Canadian presence via its long-time customer Loto-Québec. The partnership with the lottery operator is already featuring Inspired’s best-in-class interactive casino content.</p>
<p>Partnering with Industry Heavyweights</p>
<p>South of the border, Inspired continued to expand its presence in regulated gaming jurisdictions, with Connecticut being the latest US state to authorize gaming content from the supplier. Earlier this month, Inspired launched its portfolio of popular online casino games with the Boston-based gambling and technology company DraftKings.</p>
<p>The Constitution State became the third regulated US gaming jurisdiction to feature Inspired’s gaming content, expanding the supplier’s presence in New Jersey and Michigan where the B2B content provider launched some of its game titles in July and May last year.</p>
<p>To affirm its presence in markets where it is already live and expand into new jurisdictions, the B2B game content supplier is partnering with some of the heavyweights in the gaming industry, such as Rush Street Interactive (RSI) and GAN.</p>
<p>Inspired teamed with Chicago-based RSI in December to have its game titles integrated into the RSI’s platform and launch products in New Jersey, Michigan, and West Virginia, as well as other jurisdictions in which the partnership may take effect.</p>
<p>Last month, Inspired Entertainment launched its online gaming content in Michigan with GAN’s content aggregation platform.</p>
