<p>Esports Technologies Inc. continues to grow its involvement with the esports betting industry. On Thursday, the company revealed that it had signed a non-binding letter of intent to become the exclusive esports data partner for Taunt Battleworld, a Turnt Gaming blockchain game.</p>
<p>The game is a skill-based blockchain-powered product that uses the Polygon blockchain to exist and offers NFTs representing popular boxers, including Floyd Mayweather and Deontay Wilder. The game is still in development, but it’s expected to release in early 2022.</p>
<p>Powering up Taunt Battleworld with Advanced Tech</p>
<p>As a result, Esports Technologies will provide odds, outcome math, logic modeling, and game balancing to help Taunt Battleworld streamline its product and make it more appealing from the standpoint of casual and competitive gamers.</p>
<p>Through Esports Technologies’ solutions, the company will have the opportunity to feed consumers live data and lead to second-screen experiences designed to enhance the base game. Esports Technologies COO Bart Barden has welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with Turnt Gaming:</p>
<p>“We look forward to becoming the exclusive in-game data and wagering partner for Turnt Gaming, starting with Taunt Battleworld.” Esports Technologies COO Bart Barden</p>
<p>Barden and the team are excited about putting their quantitative analytics, modeling, and AI platforms to good use in creating new experiences for consumers on the blockchain. Meanwhile, Mayweather and Wilder will be just the first among many real-world fighters to be actually joining the platform.</p>
<p>Turning to NFT Collectible as Basis of Gaming</p>
<p>In a way, the game is based on the idea of collectible NFTs where you own the non-fungible token of the fighter you want to compete with. The concept will incentivize participants to acquire better and stronger NFT tokens representing their favorite fighters.</p>
<p>There are many potential fighters to tap into from here now in, including Oleksandr Usyk, Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury, Canelo Alvarez, and many other big names. Mayweather commented on the fact he is featured as an NFT in Taunt Battleworld, saying:</p>
<p>“I’m honored to be one of the first combat sports athletes to appear in Taunt Battleworld and can’t wait to see the game come to life. Taunt Battleworld and Stardam Images are reimagining the future of gaming. I’m proud to be officially part of it.” Floyd Mayweather</p>
<p>Turnt Gaming founder Jeff Liboon is quite happy with current developments, arguing that the company is excited to have working partnerships with both Esports Technologies and Polygon, which he describes as two leaders in the tech world.</p>
<p>“Also having secured two of the greatest entertainers in boxing, Floyd Mayweather and Deontay Wilder, shows our commitment to delivering unique experiences to NFT gaming,” Liboon adds.</p>
<p>Esports Technologies has been on a tear most recently, with the company landing a license in the United Kingdom. Earlier this month, the company finalized the acquisition of Aspire Global’s B2C brands.</p>
