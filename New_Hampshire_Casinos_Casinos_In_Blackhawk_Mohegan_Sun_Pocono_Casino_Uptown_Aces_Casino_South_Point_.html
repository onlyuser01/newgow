<p>The agreement is the latest display of the growing role of Prove Identity as a provider of digital identity services</p>
<p>Provider of digital identity services, Prove Identity, announced today that its services have been selected by FanDuel Group to ensure a seamless and secure gaming experience for its users.</p>
<p>Shared Vision of Player Experience</p>
<p>The agreement with FanDuel Group, an industry leader in legalized and regulated mobile sports wagering, marks Prove Identity’s continued growth within the sports betting and online casino gaming landscape.</p>
<p>Commenting on the key development, Tom Hill, director of digital identity and head of sports betting and iGaming at Prove Identity, outlined the huge role FanDuel plays in the sports betting space, serving as “the premier gaming destination” nationwide. Hill also pointed to the “shared vision of a more seamless, safer player experience” Prove Identity and FanDuel have.</p>
<p>With a high number of registration abandonment rates in this market, Prove Pre-Fill will allow FanDuel to securely migrate users through its verification process safely, allowing them to enjoy the company’s portfolio of product offerings. Tom Hill, director of digital identity &amp; head of sports betting and iGaming, Prove Identity</p>
<p>As a leader in the online gaming space, FanDuel becomes the first tier-one online sportsbook operator in the US which will utilize Prove Identity’s Pre-Fill solution. Based on bank-grade data from authoritative sources, the solution auto-fills online applications and authenticates user identities to prevent account fraud.</p>
<p>Seamless Sign-Up Process</p>
<p>Billy Turchin, senior vice president of product at FanDuel, also commented on the agreement, pointing to the major drivers behind the decision made by FanDuel to select the services of Prove Identity.</p>
<p>“We pride ourselves on being a fan-focused company and that passion has led to the continued development of new solutions that ensure our customers can have a safe experience they trust,” he said, expecting the partnership to help FanDuel protect its customers while making the sign-up process “a more seamless experience.”</p>
<p>Prove’s Pre-Fill solution will make the sign-up process faster, easier and more secure as the customer’s consent is required for the auto-fill process to begin. By shaving off clicks and keystrokes that kill the conversation, Pre-Fill makes the account opening process 80% faster and as quick as 3 clicks.</p>
<p>The agreement with FanDuel will further expand the role of Prove Identity as a provider of digital identity services globally. Currently, the company has more than 1,000 global business partners across several industries, including banks, retailers, cryptocurrency exchanges, healthcare companies, insurance firms, and others.</p>
<p>Recently, Everi Payments, a wholly owned subsidiary of the manufacturer of gaming equipment Everi Holdings, joined the roster of Prove Identity partners by selecting the provider’s identity verification services for its mobile gaming ecosystem for casino operator partners.</p>
