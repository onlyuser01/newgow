<p>Pragmatic Play has been on a tear, with one of the world’s leading iGaming suppliers securing yet another important partnership in Belgium. The new tie-up concerns the company’s dice slots portfolio and it is struck with PepperMill Casino, a prominent player in the local market.</p>
<p>As a result, Pragmatic Play will deploy many of its iconic games that have been designed to feature the dice mechanic. Among those games are The Dog House Dice, Snakes &amp; Ladders Megadice, and not least – Sweet Bonanza Dice.</p>
<p>PepperMill Casino is one of the most prominent casino brands in Belgium and an operator of both land-based and online casino games.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the casino will significantly grow its content footprint and deliver the type of content that its players have grown accustomed to expecting from the brand. Commenting on this new opportunity, PepperMill Casino General Director Anthony Rus:</p>
<p>"It goes without saying that Pragmatic Play is one of the world’s most prominent providers, with a portfolio stacked with instantly recognizable games."</p>
<p>Rus added that PepperMill Casino has already introduced games by Pragmatic Play in the past and players have been happy with the results. Irina Cornides, Chief Operating Officer at Pragmatic, has expressed a similar sentiment.</p>
<p>She said that the dice slot portfolio elevated the traditional experience and introduced players to ways to generate even bigger wins. "We’re thrilled to expand our partnership with PepperMill Casino by bringing Pragmatic Play’s highly entertaining selection of dice slots to players in Belgium," Cornides added.</p>
<p>PepperMill Casino has been actively strengthening its selection of content over the past several months. The company has added games by BF Games, Stakelogic, and BetSoft among some of the cutting-edge suppliers to strengthen the casino’s offer.</p>
<p>As to Pragmatic Play, the supplier has been ramping up its partnerships and new alliances. Pragmatic has built a solid portfolio of games that is readily available across a number of global brands, with PepperMill Casino now becoming the latest in a long line of tier-one operators.</p>
