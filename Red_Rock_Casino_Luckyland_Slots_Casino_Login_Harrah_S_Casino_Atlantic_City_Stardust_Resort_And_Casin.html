    <h1>Red Rock Casino Luckyland Slots Casino Login Harrah S Casino Atlantic City Stardust Resort And Casin</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a complaint regarding a wrong bonus release. My first deposit was in value of 100 Euros with a bonus of 120 Euros. I have attached the terms and conditions for the bonus.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions for this bonus clearly mentions that all winning coming from this bonus needs to be wagered. What I’m basically trying to prove is that my winning are not coming from the bonus and that they are coming from my next deposits.</p>
<p>After the first deposit, in the next 5 minutes I have consumed all my credits: my deposit and the bonus. I have attached the game history and if you sum up all the numbers you will get exactly 0. So the first deposit and the bonus were completely consumed. Next, I have made 3 more deposits and from the third deposit I won around 6000 Euros. After that I have tried to withdraw when I saw my whole balance was on bonus. Tried to explain the fact that the winning came from my 4th deposit to the customer support, but they don’t understand this fact. I have attached another printscreen with the transaction history which validates my words. Here you can see that I had 4638.60 Euros reduced from my balance according to the promotion.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that my balance should have 4638.6 Euros extra, because all wining comes from my 3rd deposit after the bonus (4th in total). When I have made the second deposit, my balance was 0 so absolutely no winning from the bonus. At no point the terms and conditions state that after exhausting the bonus the next deposits are still bonus. So my second, third and fourth deposits should have been without any bonus and the winning should have been available for withdrawl.</p>
<p>I am requesting a thorough verification of my account and a refund of 4638.6 in my account.</p>
<p>Please contact me if you need further informations.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
