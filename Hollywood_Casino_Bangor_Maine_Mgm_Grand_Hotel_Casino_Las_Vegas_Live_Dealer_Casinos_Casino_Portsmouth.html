<p>The Canadian entertainment giant Kings Entertainment has demonstrated great interest in the metaverse. According to the company, it seeks to find “the next frontier of online gaming” and believes the solution lies in the virtual space.</p>
<p>Kings Entertainment Prepares for Metaverse Foray</p>
<p>Kings Entertainment has already secured an URL and has inked a deal with a global digital asset investment and capital markets advisory firm in order to better plan its next move. The company has also created a whole internal division that will be responsible for metaverse operations.</p>
<p>Kings is currently working on a deal to purchase the Vegas City area in the 3D virtual world browser-based platform Decentraland. The company plans to usher in a new age of betting by taking gambling to the digital world.</p>
<p>Kings will have to deal with significant competition as it isn’t the first operator to eye the Vegas City area in Decentraland. Thanks to Las Vegas’ popularity and connection with gambling, several other notable operators have shown interest as well. Furthermore, Decentraland’s Vegas City area is one of the biggest in the 3D platform, presenting many opportunities to bookmakers who wish to take their business to the metaverse.</p>
<p>Decentraland as a whole is one of the most appealing destinations for gambling operators who are interested to take their business to virtual reality. The platform is based on non-fungible tokens, which is a concept that has already come to have some associations with the gambling industry. Additionally, plots of land are NFTs so once someone owns a location in Decentraland, they own it for good.</p>
<p>Kings Chooses to Trust in Technology</p>
<p>According to Kings Entertainment, virtual reality is where the bets of tomorrow will be placed. The Canadian company has chosen to trust in technology and capitalize on the growing popularity of 3D platforms and blockchain solutions.</p>
<p>Steve Budin, the chief executive officer of Kings Entertainment, spoke on his company’s drive for innovation. He said that Kings Entertainment is always seeking to explore what’s new, implement it to its offerings and present a fresh betting experience to its players. Budin added that the company has always trusted in technology.</p>
<p>He mentioned that back in 1997, while people were still taking sports wagers through the telephone, he trusted in the potential of the Internet and developed internet strategies. Trusting in the metaverse is the next step in the company’s evolution.</p>
<p>True to Budin’s words, Kings Entertainment continues to pursue innovation. The company recently launched the LotteryHub – a lottery application that allows users to instantly check their results.</p>
