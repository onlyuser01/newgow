    <h1>Herrahs Casino French Lick Indiana Casino Hardrock Casino Biloxi Grant Choctaw Casino New Casino In</h1>

<p>On the 21/may I joined up Neon54 casino and played deposited 2x 300 total $600 lost , on 24th got and started playing made a total of 11 deposits to the total $6800 before I had a $12000 win I kept playing and stopped playing at $13000 in my account when I went to make a withdrawal request and was told I could only withdraw $750 a day x 3, I was very annoyed that I could only withdraw 750. I asked him about the withdrawal policy and they gave me a big write down. I thought it is what it is and I put in my first withdrawal request for 750 come of my total my new total $12250 , the following evening I put in three 750 withdrawal request come of my total new total $10000 I played that evening lost $3000 so my closing total was $7000 , the following day I got an email stating that I needed to produce some ID. They wanted drivers license and the credit card that I used to make the deposit which I did I sent me an email saying your withdrawal was successfully and it’s on its way then I get another email saying that my three 750 request had failed due to something to do with my ID and my account would be closed They didn’t say why and they would refund my last deposit I said to them I spent 6800 that even and why would you only give me my last deposit the lady I was chatting to from there support team said you would get all back , they sent me couple of emails offering 75% discount bonus is I sent them a couple of emails how disappointed I was and we should try and resolve this and I’m not worried about the 75% discount at their offering. I just want to resolve the issue , and that’s where we’re at right now. Ps iv tried downloading all the emails I’ve exceeded the amount that you guys take. So if you want the rest of them just let me know and I’ll forward them to you. Thank you</p>
