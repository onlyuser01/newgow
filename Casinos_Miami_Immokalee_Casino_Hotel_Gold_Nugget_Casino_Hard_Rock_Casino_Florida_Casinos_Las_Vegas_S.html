<p>Esports Entertainment Group (EEG)’s vice president of Esports Betting Bux Khalid Syed has left his position and the company, the esports expert announced on his LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>Back to Providing Consulting Services</p>
<p>Syed left EEG last month, having spent almost two years with the esports betting provider since his appointment in October 2020 as Head of Operations. Based in Cape Town, South Africa, Syed was promoted to Head of Esports Betting shortly after and spent nearly half a year in the position before climbing further up the corporative ranks.</p>
<p>Promoted to Vice President/Director of Esports Betting in March 2021, Syed became responsible for the profit and loss account of the vertical, marketing and execution deals and product development. He was also tasked with brand-building community initiatives, providing cross-departmental support and identifying business gaps. Syed was reporting directly to Group CEO Grant Johnson.</p>
<p>To mark his departure from EEG, Syed published a short statement on his LinkedIn profile to express his gratitude to Marketing Director Magnus Leppäniemi and Johnson, as well as his appreciation for all the work done and time spent by all the partners who helped the VIE brand’s expansion in Latin America.</p>
<p>“With that said, I’m no longer exclusive to a company. I am back to iGaming and esports betting consulting for foreseeable future,” Syed concluded.</p>
<p>Founder of Firms across Different Sectors</p>
<p>Before joining EEG, Syed, whose professional career started outside of the gaming industry as Event Coordinator at New Era Entertainment, an event organizer company he founded in 2009, spent two years and eight months at EZY Gaming as Head of Esports during which he oversaw the esports-related business matters for Arcane Bet, a B2C firm he founded, and EZY Gaming.</p>
<p>His career also features just over eight-and-a-half years with Digital Outsource Services, starting as Sales Executive in 2012 and growing to Esports Executive for Betway Esports in February 2014, a role he performed for over five years until he left to join EZY Gaming.</p>
<p>Syed’s profile also includes a short spell as a Junior Japanese Shipping Agent with Trade Ocean, managing and coordinating the client’s incoming Japanese vessels into the Cape Town harbor.</p>
