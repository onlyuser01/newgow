    <h1>Casinos In Tahoe Casino Stardew Casino With Restaurant Immokolee Casino Acorn Casino Playson Inks Ne</h1>

<p>Playson has signed a new deal with Grand Casino Baden, agreeing to supply the latter with its top-tier selection of games</p>
<p>The leading game developer that offers its state-of-the-art content in 18+ regulated jurisdictions has chosen one of Switzerland’s most successful online casino operators to expand its presence in the region. The new deal will allow Playson to bring its portfolio of 85+ eye-catching omnichannel games and immersive advertising tools closer to more Swiss players.</p>
<p>What Should Swiss Players Expect?</p>
<p>The first-class solution provider whose games are certified for the biggest regulated gaming markets in Europe will integrate its titles with the Swiss operator’s online brand called Jackpots.ch. The online brand was the pioneer online casino in the country of Switzerland and the first site that went live with the help of the Gamanza platform.</p>
<p>The Gamanza platform belongs to the Gamanza Group which was acquired by the Stadtcasino Baden Group in 2021. Some of Playson’s freshest game releases will be integrated into the platform. The list includes games like Diamond Fortunator: Hold and Win, Wolf Power Megaways, and Lion Gems: Hold and Win.</p>
<p>Playson, “Pleased” to Sign the Deal</p>
<p>Playson’s sales director Blanka Homor expressed their pleasure to have signed the new agreement with Grand Casino Baden, calling them “one of the most prominent operators in Switzerland”. Homor explained the significance of the agreement that would allow them to expand in the important European market while providing their popular games to a larger number of customers.</p>
<p>Grand Casino Baden, “Delighted” to Welcome Playson on Board</p>
<p>The land-based casino and Business-to-Consumer operator has managed to establish an important presence in Switzerland’s regulated gaming market since its launch. The casino already has a rich selection of popular casino games on display.</p>
<p>Grand Casino Baden’s chief online gaming Brian Christner expressed their delight to welcome Playson on board while preparing to integrate their beloved games into their offering. To Christner, the news represents a “fantastic” development for the online casino’s database of players.</p>
<p>Christner explained that the operator aims to preserve its position as a leading online casino operator, which is why it is essential to keep offering the same type of “rich gaming experiences” to players. Playson’s “engaging content” has been handpicked to serve this precise goal.</p>
<p>The developer relies on engaging game mechanics and math, a series of value-adding promotional options, consultancy, in-house network advertising, and fast-reply technical support available on a 24-hour basis. Their turnkey solution is the perfect match for the most ambitious and successful iGaming operators in the industry.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Playson announced a content-oriented deal with casino aggregator iGaming Group, helping Playson integrate its games into the group’s offering. A similar deal was announced during the same month with leading gaming and entertainment brand SkillOnNet.</p>
