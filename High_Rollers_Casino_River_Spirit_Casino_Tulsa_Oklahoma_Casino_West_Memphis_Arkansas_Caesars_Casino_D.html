    <h1>High Rollers Casino River Spirit Casino Tulsa Oklahoma Casino West Memphis Arkansas Caesars Casino D</h1>

<p>This one demonstrates the integrity of WildCasino management to absolutely earn their questionable reputation. Lets get into it, shall we...? I was extended an "exclusive offer" through email by WildCasino</p>
<p>on October 14th. Being that it is an "exclusive" offer one would assume it was personally curated for the recipient. The bonus was a 100% match on a $100 deposit. I deposited $101 and..... No bonus... I contacted customer service about this bonus and spoke with the rep Matthew Collins. He was very friendly and we even exchanged some humor. He appologized for the inconvenience and stated he would manually add the bonus and I should expect it to post within 15 min...</p>
<p>30 min later still no bonus, so back into chat I go. The next rep Megan said that I exited the chat before Matthew could verify eligibility. As seen in the transcript provided, that is not the case. Infact Matthew is the one who ended the chat upon agreeing to add the bonus. After putting up resistance and stating the "no bonus within 14 days of a withdraw policy" I asked why they would extend this "exclusive" offer with an expiration date that was well before my eligibility would begin. After asking for a supervisor a compromise of 50% of the original bonus amount with the same rollover of 35x was offered.</p>
<p>Great... So I see the $50 show up in my bonus balance and went to my bonus page. The rollover on this $50 is $7,000! that is a 140x rollover... Even though the offer was a 35x which would have made it $1,750...</p>
<p>Back into chat I go... This time I speak with a rep named Ben who upon being explained the circumstance said management decided not to honor the offer THEY MADE! Which was already a compromise.</p>
<p>I want what was originally offered to me through a personalized email that claimed to be intended for myself. That would be a $100 bonus with a 35x rollover...</p>
<p>This casino has made things right before.. Im hoping they do the same this time.</p>
