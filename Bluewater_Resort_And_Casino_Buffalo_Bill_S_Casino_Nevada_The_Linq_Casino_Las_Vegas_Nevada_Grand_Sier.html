    <h1>Bluewater Resort And Casino Buffalo Bill S Casino Nevada The Linq Casino Las Vegas Nevada Grand Sier</h1>

<p>Provider of gambling software and technology GAN announced it has launched GAN Sports in partnership with Island View Casino in Gulfport, Mississippi, to increase B2B sports betting revenue streams.</p>
<p>Expand B2B Sports Betting Revenue Streams</p>
<p>The launch of GAN Sports on September 27, 2022, marked the debut of the company’s new sportsbook technology platform that utilizes technology from its COOLBET brand tailored to meet the needs of the B2B market in the US. GAN acquired COOLBET at the beginning of 2021.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of GAN Sports, president and chief executive officer of GAN Dermot Smurfit was thrilled to announce the premiere of “perhaps the most innovative sports experience available on-property” in the US, highlighting the sales momentum for the company’s omnichannel sports betting technology and managed trading services solution is seen as “highly favorable and incremental” to GAN’s existing B2B products and services.</p>
<p>On GAN’s partner for the launch, Island View Casino, Smurfit said that the entire GAN team was looking forward to contributing to the future growth of the casino’s existing sportsbook by delivering its complete enterprise solution, including on-property solution, PAM and the omnichannel iBridge Framework for linking loyalty programs.</p>
<p>The launch of GAN Sports is the latest display of GAN’s in-house online and retail sports betting technology capabilities and is expected to become the first of many throughout 2023. Following the launch, Island View Casino is offering retail sports betting via twenty kiosks and will soon complement the offering by the ‘Bet the V’ mobile sportsbook.</p>
<p>The mobile solution is powered by GAN’s market-leading GameSTACK Player Account Management (PAM) system that enables omnichannel sports betting at the kiosks and over personal mobile devices while on-property.</p>
<p>‘Exciting New On-Property Sports Betting Experience’</p>
<p>Steve Hendricks, vice president of Operations at Island View Casino Resort, outlined that the selection of GAN as a sports betting technology supplier was the result of a thorough evaluation of all potential suppliers, hailing the quality of GAN’s sports betting technology and managed trading services.</p>
<p>“GAN has now brought to our patrons an exciting new on-property sports betting experience,” Hendricks continued stressing the partner’s “modern technology and market-leading user interface design” that will encourage the casino patrons to “construct high-margin, multi-stage parlay bets as well as traditional single-game wagers.”</p>
<p>As part of the partnership, GAN will also deliver its complete end-to-end solution to provide marketing and customer services and elevate the betting experience to a new level.</p>
<p>The agreement with Island View Casino will also allow GAN market access in Mississippi for statewide mobile sports betting and casino gaming if the state approves both activities in the future.</p>
