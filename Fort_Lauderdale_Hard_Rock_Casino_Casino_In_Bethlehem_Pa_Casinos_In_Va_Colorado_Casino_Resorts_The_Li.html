<p>The leading content provider and aggregator for the iGaming industry, Pariplay, announced its entry into the regulated market in Buenos Aires City, Argentina. On Monday, NeoGames' subsidiary revealed that it is now a registered supplier for the regulated market.</p>
<p>The recent market entry comes after the Lottery of the City of Buenos Aires (LOTBA), the government body tasked with the regulation, control and permission of gambling activities, registered Pariplay as a supplier. Thanks to this entry, the company expanded its presence further into the LatAm region. What's more, the recent entry complements Pariplay's ongoing global expansion.</p>
<p>Jorge L Morales, Pariplay's Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, commented on the topic in a statement released on September 5, 2022, by saying: "Buenos Aires is one of the most dynamic cities in the whole of the Latin American region when it comes to the online gambling sector." Moreover, he explained that the recent entry marks an important milestone for the company in the region. In conclusion, Morales said that the company is looking forward to joining forces with leading local companies and seeing the market grow further.</p>
<p>Adrian Bailey, Pariplay's Managing Director, added: "The Autonomous City of Buenos Aires has a rich heritage in the industry, and it is very satisfying to have gained our first supplier license in Argentina." Outlining that the city has significant potential, he acknowledged that the LatAm region remains a key priority for the company. Last but not least, Bailey said: "We look forward to working with operators to provide players with the widest range of content available on the market, including games with special local appeal."</p>
<p>Pariplay's license in Buenos Aires City means that the company can now join forces with operators in the jurisdiction. Those operators can benefit from accessing the company's Fusion aggregation platform which features 14,000 titles from more than 80 iGaming providers as well as localized content. The innovative platform offers access to all gaming content such as instant games, sportsbook, virtual sports and bingo games via single API integration.</p>

Such tools include Independent Bonus Wallet, Free Spins, Tournaments, Raffle Rocket and Spin that Wheel. According to Pariplay, its partners can leverage all of those tools for the complete portfolio of games.</p>
