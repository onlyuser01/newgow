    <h1>Prairieband Casino Thunderbolt Casino Closest Casino Near Me Casino In Las Vegas Casino Locations Tr</h1>

<p>Greetings Paul and Petronela,</p>
<p>After reviewing the case and your communications with the casino Paul, the underlying theme I find is one of resistance.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that it is necessary to require players to go through such an arduous process of validation, no one more than the casino itself would prefer to simplify this. We are in the entertainment business after all.</p>
<p>The information required to complete an international bank transaction is also extensive and needs to be 100% correct or the funds never reach their intended destination.</p>
<p>The fact remains, until the world is filled with 100% honest people we will need to verify documents to assure no one can benefit from your account except you. And until the international banking community simplifies the wire transfer process we will need to provide all of the specifics required to make that transaction.</p>
<p>It's not a question of our preference certainly, and we are constantly working on improving the system while still maintaining the necessary level of security for our players.</p>
<p>On behalf of myself and the casino I genuinely apologize for your frustration however after reviewing the history of this case quite extensively I truly believe that had you chosen to fully comply initially with an understanding that there is a purpose and a need for everything requested you would have received the funds from your win a long time past.</p>
<p>But as they say, all is well that ends well. You did finally last month submit the final piece of the puzzle by providing the required banking information for transfer. Unfortunately due to some of the "thoughts and feelings" you expressed at the time regarding being required to do so I was unable to have your account reinstated.</p>
<p>However, I was able to have your requested and very valid win reviewed, approved, and sent to our 3rd party for payment yesterday. You should be seeing that money clear your bank account in the coming business days.</p>
<p>I do so love a happy ending.</p>
<p>Let us know when it comes in.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Nick and True Blue</p>
