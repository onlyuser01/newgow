<p>Have you heard the big news? The back-to-back NBA Champions from the Golden State Warriors will open their participation in the 2019 Western Conference Semifinals, hosting the Houston Rockets on the team’s home turf at Oracle Arena on Sunday.</p>
<p>Game 1: 2019 NBA Semifinals – Warriors vs Rockets</p>
<p>The 2019 NBA Semifinals in the Western Conference are off to a promising star with the Golden State Warriors facing up the Houston Rockets in their first game in the series. The teams will be battling it out at 12:30 PM on Sunday at the Oracle Arena, home of the Warriors.</p>
<p>These two historic opponents definitely have experience playing against each other. In 2018, Houston were leading 3-2 when their star player, Chris Paul, suffered an injury, leaving his team at the mercy of the Warriors.</p>

<p>Can the Warriors Clinch Victory in Game 1?</p>
<p>The Warriors are coming strong in the Semifinals. NBA analysts have repeatedly said that the only team that can defeat the Warriors would be the Warriors themselves. Well, they nearly managed to lose against the Clippers, showing everyone that there are chinks in their armor to still be taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Houston Rockets have a variety of players who know how to play against an assumingly superior opponent. Having had them up against the wall once, the Rockets are ready to do their best against the Warriors.</p>

<p>With players such as James Harden, Austin Rivers, and Daniel House, there is little to indicate that the Rockets will go out without a fight. There is even less to indicate that they would be losing their first game in the Semifinals either.</p>
<p>Kevin Durant for the Warriors will manage to counterweight the well-oiled Rockets team or so everyone hopes. Durant will be a free agent in the summer and some have said that he is probably not looking to play at his absolute best, but Durant has been defying any such suggestion in his recent games. With 26 points per game, he still remains an invaluable player.</p>
<p>Fear Harden, Fear the 3-Point Shots</p>
<p>James Harden exudes confidence and he is no stranger to swaying the outcome of entire games. Harden needs to be treated as a serious opponent and corralled preventing him from playing at his best. He’s known to dominate in games, managing 38 points against the Nuggets recently.</p>
<p>Harden feels pressured when he’s locked from both his behind and up front. The strategy seemed to work against the Rockets when the Utah Jazz almost shut him down completely and nearly pried away a victory from his team. Even guarded properly, though, Harden still managed to tuck in 35 points in a 100-odd game. Not too bad at all.</p>
<p>The Warriors may seem like tough contesters, but the Houston Rockets are going to come blasting in on Sunday. The stakes are certainly high and both teams seem to acknowledge the challenge that lies ahead.</p>
