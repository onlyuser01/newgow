    <h1>Washington State Casino Casinos In Monaco French Riviera Beau Rivage Resort Casino Sam S Town Casino</h1>

<p>Hello sita1215g and the CasinoGuru team,</p>
<p>We learned the issue, so let's get familiarized with it.</p>
<p>On 18th of February 2023, the player told us that he can't launch casino games. The reason is that the security team require this player to pass the verification process, and if it's successful, the access to the casino will be restored.</p>
<p>It is stated in our Terms and Conditions, "General Terms" section, point 39 that our Security team may bring up the verification if decides that it is necessitated. Here is the quote from the rules:</p>
<p>"39. Should the bookmaker’s Security Service have any concerns about the bettor’s identity or their personal details (address, credit or debit card, other data), they are entitled to request any documents from the bettor substantiating their identity or other submitted data at the bookmaker’s absolute discretion, as well as to cancel any payments until all such details are verified. Verification may take up to 72 hours from the receipt of documents. If it is proven that the submitted data is false, the bookmaker is entitled to cancel all bets and suspend all transactions for an indefinite period of time and proceed with full verification of the account. The betting company has the right to request for the documents to be sent by the post. The bookmaker reserves the right to request any documents required for such verification."</p>
<p>At first, the security team asked the player to upload the ID document, and specify why the data in the registration form differ from the one in the document. After this issue was fixed, the security team asked to provide them with the screenshots of the player's deposits. The player sent us the photo of the phone with the deposit details opened and the screenshot of the transaction history. None of these are relevant to the requirement.</p>
<p>So, we kindly ask the player to make sure that he is not sending the photos of the phone, but screenshots and send them here: security@megapari.com</p>
<p>Please, keep in mind that the period of document verification is up to 72 hours, and also that we do not limit the time needed to provide the necessary files, so the player can do it anytime.</p>
