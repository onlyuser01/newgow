<p>BetMGM, the leading sports betting and digital gaming brand of MGM Resorts International and Entain, announced today the addition of another high-profile figure from the world of sports to the ranks of its brand ambassadors, NBA legend Kevin Garnett.</p>
<p>Illustrious NBA Career</p>
<p>With 21 NBA seasons under his belt playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets, Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett will feature in BetMGM’s upcoming marketing campaigns, social media content, promotions and fan events.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to be working with BetMGM to share their insights with my fans. It’s a natural fit for both myself and BetMGM given our mutual desire to stay on top of the ever-changing sports business landscape.” Kevin Garnett, Brand Ambassador, BetMGM</p>
<p>Member of the All-Star team in 15 seasons, Kevin Garnett was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2004 and won the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2008, the year in which he won the NBA Championship with the Boston Celtics. The team announced it would retire Garnett’s jersey this spring.</p>
<p>Kevin Garnett brings a unique energy to everything he does, on and off the court. As the basketball season tips off, we look forward to welcoming Kevin to the BetMGM family and working with him on a variety of fan-focused promotions.” Matt Prevost, Chief Revenue Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>Prominent Public Figure</p>
<p>Since his retirement from professional basketball in 2016, Kevin Garnett has entered the field of entrepreneurship and recently became a co-founder of Gaming Society. The gaming and content platform with a focus on inclusivity, education and the athlete’s point of view in sports betting is looking to make wagering on sport more accessible and approachable, a passion Garnett had to shy away from during his years as an NBA player.</p>
<p>Kevin Garnett, who recently founded a production company focused on the production of multi-platform content, Content Cartel, featured in the 2019 film “Uncut Gems,” and is preparing a documentary called “Anything is Possible” that will make its premiere November 12 on Showtime.</p>
<p>As a brand ambassador of BetMGM, Kevin Garnett is joining an elite roster of former professional players and public personalities, including NBA legend and analyst Jalen Rose, four-time Stanley Cup winner Wayne Gretzky, NFL “Beast Mode” Marshawn Lynch and MMA media host and journalist Ariel Helwani.</p>
<p>BetMGM is one of the few gaming brands proud to provide resources to help its customers play responsibly and ensure its expansion into new gaming jurisdictions is set on a solid and safer footing.</p>
