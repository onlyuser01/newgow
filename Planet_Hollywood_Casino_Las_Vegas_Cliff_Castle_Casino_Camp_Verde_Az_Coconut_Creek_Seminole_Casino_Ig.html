<p>Users can select an exclusion period of between 3 months and a lifetime and get their gambling habits under control</p>
<p>Australia’s government reported that BetStop, the country’s new national self-exclusion register, is proving to be a resounding success. According to official data, over 10,000 people have used the register to exclude themselves from gambling so far.</p>
<p>The register was launched in August 2023 and is a result of Australia’s efforts to lower the concerning problem gambling rates in the country. Many of the self-excluded people are under 40, with many of them opting to exclude themselves from gambling for a lifetime.</p>
<p>In addition, 1,200 people were nominated as support persons. Referred to the program by self-excluded players, support persons are people who can help gamblers get through the self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>BetStop Now Boasts 10,000 Registrants</p>
<p>BetStop is a scheme that excludes participants from all forms of gambling in Australia and prevents them from receiving marketing material. Users can select an exclusion period of between 3 months and a lifetime and get their gambling habits under control.</p>
<p>BetStop is free with most registrations taking no longer than 5 minutes. Australian operators are required to raise awareness of BetStop’s services among their clients.</p>
<p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority is currently responsible for making sure that operators do not market their products to self-excluded people and do not allow them to wager through new accounts.</p>
<p>Further reinforcing the program, the government now requires operators to properly verify a customer’s identity at registration and make sure that they are not a self-excluded person or a minor.</p>
<p>BetStop Is Making a Difference</p>
<p>Australia’s Minister for Communications, Michelle Rowland, praised BetStop’s popularity, saying that the registration numbers mean that the program is “making a big difference.”</p>
<p>That’s why we launched BetStop – the National Self-Exclusion Register – in August this year as the final measure of the National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering. Michelle Rowland</p>
<p>Rowland advised people struggling with their gambling or the gambling of a loved one to visit the BetStop site and learn more about the program.</p>
<p>Amanda Rishworth, Australia’s Minister for Social Services, also commented on the matter, highlighting the government’s efforts to mitigate gambling harm.</p>
<p>It’s great that BetStop is already having such a positive impact, along with our other measures such as new evidence-based taglines that Australians would have seen on rotation on their screens and radios. Amanda Rishworth</p>
<p>Rishworth also praised the mandatory pre-verification measures, saying that they are already preventing people from finding workarounds. The Minister for Social Services concluded that harm minimization “is not a set-and-forget exercise.” Because of that, the government is working closely on implementing the measures outlined in the National Consumer Protection Framework.</p>
