    <h1>Online Casino California Kickapoo Casino Eagle Pass Danville Va Casino Meadows Casino Washington Pa</h1>

<p>Once again I have a problem withdrawing funds from https://888starz.bet/ .</p>
<p>A few months ago I tried a credit card withdrawal. Up until this point, I had only deposited funds with a credit card. I got an error saying that credit card withdrawals are temporarily unavailable. Every day I got a reply that it was temporary and to try again the next day. This went on for about a month and during that time I lost the money in my account.</p>
<p>A few months later I deposited again with a credit card. I had some profit and tried withdrawing again. I got the same error and again for about 2 weeks they told me to try the next day. After multiple calls to their support, they told me to deposit with crypto and then allowed me to withdraw my funds in crypto. I was told to use cryptocurrency for the future.</p>
<p>Two days ago I deposited an amount in cryptocurrency (about BGN 2500 in BUSD). I won about BGN 2,000 and now I have BGN 4,462 in my account. I tried to withdraw money in cryptocurrency, but I got an error saying that I must use the same withdrawal method that I used to deposit. I deposited BUSD and am trying to withdraw BUSD. I have attached a screenshot of several attempts.</p>
<p>I contacted support again. I was told to use the same method. After I said I was using the same method, I was told to use a credit card. I don't mind using a credit card, it's just that it's not currently an option at all in my account (again I'm attaching a screenshot).</p>
<p>Then they offered me to deposit money through Skrill AND then withdraw with Skrill.</p>
<p>I opened a Skrill account, deposited BGN 30 and transferred BGN 20 to 888starz.bet.</p>
<p>Then I tried to withdraw money and it failed again. I was told that I can only withdraw up to the amount I have deposited.</p>
<p>But since the other methods are impossible, I don't want to deposit another 4500 BGN. I just want to withdraw my money. The method doesn't matter to me. But they don't allow me to withdraw, they only recommend me new deposits. Or they make me make new bets of the amount I want to withdraw. They just want me to lose my money again. I don't want to deposit even 1 BGN more on this site. Nor to bet</p>
<p>I'm asking for help. I am attaching screenshots from the site. It won't let me upload a Word document that contains information about deposits made and failed withdrawals for the last year</p>
