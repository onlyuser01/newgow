    <h1>Casino Reviews Chukchansi Gold Resort Casino Fortune Online Casino Pulse Online Casino Milky Way Cas</h1>

<p>Zitro, a world leader in entertainment and a video bingo and slots specialist, has launched its critically-acclaimed Double Link machines in yet another famed casino. The Zitro-branded cabinets were brought to Casino Gran Canaria, a gambling venue on the Canary Island.</p>
<p>Double Bonus! Double Fun! .. And, Double Rewards!</p>
<p>Double Link are state-of-the-art high-tech multi-game machines that are designed to engage casino players with high-quality imagery and sound, as well as with four great games. The machines are presented on the exclusive Illusion Glare cabinet and have a 43-inch ultra HD curved screen that ensures superior immersion.</p>
<p>In addition, Double Link machines feature a special bonus round that provides players with a chance to double the bonus. Lucky players can thus earn prizes that are two times as high. Double Link machines also feature four levels of jackpots and ways to earn free games.</p>
<p>The new cabinets will allow Casino Gran Canaria visitors to enjoy premium experiences that only Zitro can deliver. The deal will help the gambling hub engage its customers while expanding the provider’s global footprint.</p>
<p>Casino Gran Canaria’s Team Is Happy to Expand Its Offer</p>
<p>Miguel Alemán, Casinos de Canarias’ chief executive officer, praised Zitro for the variety and quality of its products. He noted that the installation of the new Double Link cabinets will allow his company to reinvigorate its gaming offer with best-in-class gaming experiences. Alemán concluded that the Double Link machines have an “unbeatable presence” thanks to the Illusion Glare cabinets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jaime Aníbal-Alvarez, Zitro’s Director of Casinos España, added that his company feels privileged to launch in the Canary Islands. He is excited to make a foray in the archipelago with Zitro’s most recent casino products. Aníbal-Alvarez concluded that he is convinced the agreement with Casino Gran Canaria will be beneficial to both parties involved.</p>
<p>“We are sure that this great bet of Casino Gran Canaria, adding a new Zitro product to its offer, will result in benefits for all”.</p>
<p>Zitro has been steadily expanding its reach by launching its cutting-edge machines in multiple new casinos. In June, the company debuted the Double Link machines in the Gran Madrid Group-owned Casino Colón.</p>
<p>In August, Zitro launched the Altius Glare machines in two new gambling establishments. The first one was Gran Casino de Extremadura in Badajoz, owned by Grupo Orenes, one of Zitro’s best partners. The other was Casino Barrière Montreux, a Swedish casino near the country’s border with France.</p>
