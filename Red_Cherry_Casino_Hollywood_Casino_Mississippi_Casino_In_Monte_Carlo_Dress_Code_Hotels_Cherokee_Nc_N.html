    <h1>Red Cherry Casino Hollywood Casino Mississippi Casino In Monte Carlo Dress Code Hotels Cherokee Nc N</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have been a client with Playpix for a few months now. I've always been able to make withdrawals normally - quick withdrawals, with the pix made within just a few minutes. However, everything changed recently. A few days ago, I tried to make a withdrawal and it was left pending. After 3 days, I had not received my withdrawal and found it strange, so I decided to contact their chat support for more information. I was told that my account is now limited for monitoring. The problem is: when I try to withdraw all of my money from there, the following message appears: ClientRestrictedForActionWithdraw</p>
<p>In other words, they've locked up my money. This is illegal!</p>
<p>Do they want me to leave the platform? That's fine. I'll leave, but they can't hold my money.</p>
<p>I see thousands of people complaining about the same thing. It's clear that this has become a recurring practice from Playpix, they're locking up clients' funds.</p>
