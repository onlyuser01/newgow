<p>Dear Giorgos,</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your experience with 18bet.com</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that according to our records, your account was created on 29/11/2014 and your last login was on 04/05/2019.</p>
<p>Your last activity in your account was mainly on the sport section, instead of the casino, hence we think that your complaint is not correctly discribed and more over it's not for this specific forum.</p>
<p>However, as per our records your account was closed on 04.05.2019 due to conflict with our General Terms &amp; Conditions. Please note that you've breached the T&amp;C and our AntiFraud Department find out that you have used the same IP address which was used by another customer on the website.</p>
<p>Please find point 3.8 of "Player Registration and Deregistration Process" - 3.8 The playerâ€™s account must be registered in his/her own, personal and correct, name and personal details. The individual has to ensure that all data given at registration stage is true, complete and free from error. This therefore also means that the player has to register personally. Furthermore, a player can only have one account. Any other accounts which a player opens with Shark77 Limited, or which are beneficially owned by the player shall be considered as duplicate accounts. We shall close any duplicate account/s consequent to the identification of the main account. If we close a duplicate account, deposits will be refunded, and all bonuses, free bets and winnings acquired from such promotions using that duplicate account will be void and forfeited. If the amount in the duplicate account does not cover the amount to be refunded to us, we shall seek to recover the loss incurred directly from any other of your accounts.</p>
<p>You can read more in detail following this URL - https://www.18bet.com/pages/terms-and-conditions</p>
