<p>In Intelitics, Novig found a partner that understands the power of technology and data when it comes to effective affiliate marketing and paid media</p>
<p>Sports betting operator Novig has formed a new partnership with Intelitics. Under the deal, the performance specialist will power Novig’s affiliate programs and paid channels. The operator will also secure access to the provider’s award-winning platform and product and feature suite.</p>
<p>The agreement comes ahead of Novig’s launch in Colorado and will help it manage all affiliate and paid media activity. Thanks to this, the operator will be able to channel more players toward its platform and reinforce its acquisition and retention rates.</p>
<p>Intelitics’ platform offers state-of-the-art real-time campaign monitoring and player tracking in addition to automated reporting and personalized dashboards. All data is delivered in real-time through a single platform, providing its clients with unparalleled convenience.</p>
<p>Novig will hit the Colorado market as an online sportsbook, as agreed with the Colorado Division of Gaming. However, the operator’s true ambition is to launch a high-frequency betting exchange in the future, allowing players to set their own odds.</p>
<p>Novig Is a Tech Company at Heart</p>
<p>Intelitics’ chief executive officer, Allan Stone, commented on the agreement, saying that Novig is about to disrupt the Colorado online sports betting market with best-in-class markets and products. Stone added that his team is thrilled to be supporting the operator’s customer acquisition efforts through affiliates and paid media.</p>
<p>Our platform and suite of tools have been designed to allow operators such as Novig to maximize the potential of affiliates and paid media through real-time data that provides the insights needed to dial up successful campaigns and dial down those that are not working. Allan Stone, CEO, Intelitics</p>
<p>Stone concluded that this is “another great partnership” for his team and one that will prove Novig’s potential and ambitions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Catherine Dougherty, Novig’s head of growth marketing, said that Novig and Intelitics are a perfect match.</p>
<p>We are a technology company at heart and in Intelitics we have a partner that understands the power of technology and data when it comes to effective affiliate marketing and paid media. Catherine Dougherty, head of growth marketing, Novig</p>
<p>Dougherty praised Intelitics’ highly capable platform and toolset and said that they will be integral to driving new customer acquisition at scale and for a fraction of the cost of other marketing channels. Dougherty concluded that this would provide Novig with a huge boost in Colorado.</p>
