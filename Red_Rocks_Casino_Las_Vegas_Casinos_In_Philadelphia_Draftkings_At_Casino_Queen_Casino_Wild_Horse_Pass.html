    <h1>Red Rocks Casino Las Vegas Casinos In Philadelphia Draftkings At Casino Queen Casino Wild Horse Pass</h1>

<p>Don't even try to play their "no deposit" bonus.</p>
<p>I played their 55 USD chip, I completed the 30x playthrough at slots, winning about 180 USD. I don't complain they cut the 180 to 100, that was the maximum withdraw limit for the bonus from the start.</p>
<p>The 100 USD became withdrawable at the system which means that I met all the terms, so I tested the legitimacy of the casino by withdrawing the 100. I also sent them my id papers to validate my account. After 1 week they said that my withdrawal was declined because I did not deposit 20 USD first.</p>
<p>1) There was no such term, the money became withdrawable FOR A REASON, that was I completed the terms, no deposit needed.</p>
<p>2) If a casino fails to payout 100 USD, how can you trust them and deposit money?</p>
<p>3) Their customer service is horrible repeating the same thing, never answering all the above. If there was an answer I suppose they d give it to me.</p>
<p>AVOID THEM! THERE ARE OTHER CASINOS TO TRUST!</p>
