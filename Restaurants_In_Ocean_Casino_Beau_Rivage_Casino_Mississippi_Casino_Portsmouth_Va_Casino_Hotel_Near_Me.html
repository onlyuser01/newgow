    <h1>Restaurants In Ocean Casino Beau Rivage Casino Mississippi Casino Portsmouth Va Casino Hotel Near Me</h1>

<p>Yes this is Jennifer Fox and yes I did make a deposit. The first deposit was $98 and I lost it and then made another deposit of $105. I played for a while and made sure I completed my playthrough and I ended it winning $2426.34. I knew about the fact that I couldn't request the bonus money and so I requested $2100. They immediately took out the bonus money of $315 which left only a few cents in the account. I did send in all of my documentation for approval and was online with their chat support team and they said it takes 3 to 7 business days to approve things. I then emailed and emailed and emailed to ask why nobody was reaching out to me but only I have received an automated reply that states they are busy and will get back to me in 3 business days but it has been far more than that. Yes this is my first withdraw request. I have played at a few casinos before and have never had this happen before so I am aware of the documentation process but have always been approved and I think the longest I have even had to wait was 24 hours. I do understand that some casinos may take a few days but my request was on the 22nd of December. My user name that I made on their site is jennifox79 but they also have a user ID for me which is sevb7j9fgz. And my withdraw request ID # is 1144631. For $2100 which still shows as pending. I did deposit as bitcoin and sent them my bitcoin address for withdraw when I spoke to the chat help. I have not played since because I'm afraid to spend any more money. But they do keep sending me messages with offers. My email with them is Jenifox3@gmail.com.</p>
<p>thank you for your help.</p>
