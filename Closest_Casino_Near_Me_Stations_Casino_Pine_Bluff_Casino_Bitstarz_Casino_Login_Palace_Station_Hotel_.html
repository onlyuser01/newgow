<p>Following the mega-merger by Caesars Entertainment and Eldorado Resorts in July, the new giant Caesars Entertainment extended its rewards loyalty program. The program now includes 18 Eldorado Resorts properties acquired following the mega-merger.</p>
<p>Caesars Rewards Loyalty Program Extends with 20%</p>
<p>The gaming industry giant Caesars Entertainment has announced the extending of the Caesars Rewards loyalty program to Eldorado Resorts. The loyalty program extension was possible following the mega-merger by Caesars Entertainment and Eldorado Resorts back in July in a deal for $17.3 billion. Upon completion of the merger, the new industry giant kept the name Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>Now the company extends Caesars Rewards to 18 Eldorado Resorts properties acquired in the merger. This marks a growth of the rewards program by Caesars with 20%. Following the recent extension of the program, now there is a combined network of more than 55 world-class resorts across the U.S. that feature the program and new locations include Florida, Colorado, Ohio, and St. Louis.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the customers of each company‚Äôs legacy rewards programs were seamlessly integrated into the newly expanded Caesars Rewards loyalty program. Furthermore, the members can use their loyalty currency and match their status universally.</p>
