<p>Bettors Backing Dustin Johnson for US Open at Pebble Beach, Koepka, McIlroy, Woods Trail Closely</p>

<p>Dustin Johnson has emerged as the clear betting favorite in Las Vegas for this week’s US Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links on the iconic Monterey Peninsula.</p>

<p>Despite world No. 1 Brooks Koepka’s major dominance – he’s won the last two PGA Championships and last two US Opens – Johnson’s name has been printed on more sports betting ticket slips than any other golfer in the 156-player field.</p>
<p>As a result, the Westgate SuperBook has shortened DJ’s title chances from +800 earlier in the week, to +650 this afternoon. Koepka is next at +800, and Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy are at +1000.</p>
<p>FanDuel has things slightly different, with DJ and McIlroy the co-frontrunners at +900. Koepka is next at +1000, and Woods +1100. Caesars has Johnson at +700, and Koepka, Woods, and McIlroy at +900. Caesars sportsbook director Jeff Davis said the money on Brooks, Tiger, and Dustin is “very close.”</p>
<p>The 119th US Open tees off Thursday at Pebble Beach.</p>
<p>Betting Bonanza</p>
<p>Legal sports betting is now operational in eight states, and oddsmakers in all of them will try and garner as much wagering activity as possible for golf’s toughest test.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks have offered various prop bets on the US Open, but none more so than the SuperBook. Along with odds for all 156 players, the sportsbook has 85 tournament matchups and 100 propositions available for action.</p>
<p>The over/under winning score is at 276.5 strokes, and the cut at 146.5 strokes on the par 71 course that will measure 7,075 yards. The SuperBook has the over/under on the lowest round of the week at 65.5, and the odds of a hole in one at Yes -135, No +115.</p>
<p>Bettors can also take player matchups, a few notable offerings include: Johnson -135 vs. Koepka +115 McIlroy -180 vs. Woods +150 Jordan Spieth +135 vs. Patrick Cantlay -155</p>
<p>Can’t decide between a couple favorites? The SuperBook allows bettors to take Koepka and Johnson, with either winning the US Open netting $400 per $100 wagered. Koepka and Woods returns even more at $500.</p>
<p>Woods, the 2019 Masters winner, says his game is in good form.</p>
<p>It’s not the same body that I had back in 2000. I don’t think any of us have the same body we had 19 years ago,” Woods explained.”</p>
<p>But the 15-time major winner added, “The golf ball is going further than it did back in 2000. I’m slower than I was in 2000. Apples to oranges, I guess you could say I am about the same distance. And so the golf course really doesn’t play that much differently for me.”</p>
<p>Longshots Could Score Major Win</p>
<p>While the majority of the media attention will be on the favorites, the deep US Open field provides bettors with numerous players who have a decent chance of winning at rather long odds.</p>
<p>Graeme McDowell, the US Open winner the last time it was contested at Pebble, won in March in Punta Cana, and is coming off a T8 at the Canadian Open. He says he isn’t here this week to reminisce, but compete. He’s at 100/1.</p>
<p>Former No. 1 Adam Scott has five Top 10 finishes this year including a runner-up finish last week. He’s at 30/1.</p>
<p>For the ultimate gamble, there are several amateur qualifiers at 3000/1. Should the unlikeliest of scenarios occur, bettors who risk just $5 will net $15,000.</p>
