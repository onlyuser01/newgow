    <h1>Grand Vegas Casino Quinalt Casino Miami Online Casino Legends Casino Events Prairie S Edge Casino Ho</h1>

<p>The market-leading sports technology company, Stats Perform, was recognized by the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA) Data Standards for a third consecutive year. The prestigious accreditation celebrates the company's commitment to sports data integrity and quality. Stats Perform's data is currently used by a global network of sports betting operators in different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Now, the latest achievement marks a milestone moment for the company. This is because Stats Perform is the first sports data provider in the world to secure accreditation for its data quality and integrity within the sports betting vertical for three years in a row.</p>
<p>The Data Standards introduced by IBIA probe data operators to ensure the quality and integrity of their data. In fact, Stats Perform was the first data provider that showed support for IBIA's Data Standards, acknowledging that integrity and quality of sports data is vitally important when combating match-fixing or corruption. To achieve the latest certification, the company went through an independent audit completed by eCogra.</p>
<p>In a statement released on January 30, 2023, Stats Perform's Global Head of Integrity, Jake Marsh, said: "Stats Perform is dedicated to positively influencing the sport integrity ecosystem." He added that the company supports the Data Standards accreditation as it plays an important role in the data supply standards on a global scale.</p>
<p>Finally, Marsh said: "We are proud to work closely with the IBIA and its members on related projects in managing integrity risk; this is further evidence of our commitment to the protection of sport."</p>
<p>Khalid Ali, IBIA's CEO, added that Stats Perform's latest accreditation is a testament to the quality and value of their sports data. "IBIA members also view the Data Standards protocols as an essential initiative, which have a positive impact on the sports betting environment," said Ali in conclusion.</p>
<p>Andrew Ashenden, Stats Perform's Chief Betting Officer, pointed out that the company has long supported high standards for sports data. He added that Stats Perform is excited to become the first sports data provider to secure the prestigious accreditation for three consecutive years.</p>
<p>"Achieving the standard for an unprecedented third year in a row affirms the reason Stats Perform's Betting and Opta sports data is chosen by the world's leading sports federations, sportsbooks and pricing providers: it powers trusted experiences for millions of global sports bettors," said Ashenden in conclusion.</p>
<p>Only recently, Fanatics Betting and Gaming became the latest member of IBIA. Before that, the innovative sports betting company that focuses on micro-betting markets, Simplebet, also joined forces with the Association becoming one of its members.</p>
