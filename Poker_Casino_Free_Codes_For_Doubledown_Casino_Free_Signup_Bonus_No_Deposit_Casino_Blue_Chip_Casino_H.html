<p>Global B2B sports betting &amp; iGaming supplier FSB has been recommended for licensing approval by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, opening a new chapter in the company’s business. Awarding a Manufacturers and Information Service Provider to the company will solidify its standing as a global and world-class sports wagering and interactive gambling provider and help bring it to one of the most prominent sports betting jurisdictions in the United States.</p>
<p>NGCB Backs FSB’s Bid to Acquire Nevada License</p>
<p>FSB had several representatives at the NGCB hearing on September 7, seeking to ensure that they can meet the regulator’s questions and expectations. Presently, FSB is hoping to be granted the right to launch with local sportsbook operators by offering them its omnichannel solutions while making tailored adjustments to ensure that it brings the best possible product to market.</p>
<p>FSB CEO Dave McDowell spoke about the likely prospect of the company securing the desired license and what the implications for the company would be, saying:</p>
<p>Securing regulatory approval in Nevada is a true trust stamp on the quality of a service provider and as a Tier 1 supplier with a laser focus on key regulated global markets this is a jurisdiction, we simply have to be present in. FSB CEO Dave McDowell</p>
<p>McDowell said that FSB will look to be a part of the long-term sports betting story of Nevada, offering both interactive wagering opportunities and iGaming across multiple states and North America in general. FSB CRO Ian Freeman similarly welcomed this opportunity and said that the company had identified Nevada as a strategic state for the company.</p>
<p>FSB Is Committed to Being Part of Nevada’s iGaming and Sports Future</p>
<p>We are very thankful to the NGCB for their time and attention. It has been a very thorough process undertaken by extremely professional people. This milestone represents a significant step forward towards realizing our commercial goals,” he added. The company has been expanding steadily in North and South America.</p>
<p>FSB secured a license to expand in South Dakota in mid-August. Two weeks ago, the company also set up a new tech hub in Colombia which will be helping the company continue to grow its expertise.</p>
