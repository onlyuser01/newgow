<p>Harvest Wilds review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Harvest Wilds has a cheerful farming theme.</p>
<p>Players will arrive at a sunny farm to discover a host of ripe veggies ready to be picked. Carrots, pumpkins, peppers, and eggplants all wait in the fields, and with a little effort players will haul in the harvest.</p>
<p>This slot is a good choice for players who enjoy other produce themes such as fruit machines, or those who dream of a wholesome life out on a farm.</p>
<p>Big win in the Harvest Wilds slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The upbeat soundtrack features plenty of twanging notes that will get players in the mood for a country lifestyle. Wins are celebrated with a satisfying splatting noise and a beeping sound that brings to mind a classic slot game.</p>
<p>Each of the vegetable symbols is animated in a bold, colourful cartoon style. The variety of vegetable types creates a sense of plenty with everything from corn to turnips included in the harvest. The purple eggplants and burgundy beets stand out as particularly vibrant among the selection.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see the rolling golden fields of a farm and a clear blue sky above. In the foreground, a picket fence and a few purple flowers help create the farm atmosphere.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a welcoming pastoral atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Harvest Wilds is a seven-reel, seven-row slot.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for landing combinations of 5 or more matching symbols in a cluster.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that symbols that are part of winning combinations will vanish. Then, new symbols will fall from above to take their place.</p>
<p>Players can buy directly into the bonus if they wish (see further details below).</p>
<p>Note: The Bonus Buy is an active feature that offers Feature Spins to the player. The feature costs a set amount, depending on your bet, and stays active until it is manually disabled by the player.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols and also functions as a multiplier symbol. It takes the form of a Sunflower symbol that grows from Seed symbols.</p>
<p>Whenever players land a Seed symbol, it will transform into a Sunflower Wild symbol providing there is at least one win possible on the reels.</p>
<p>The Sunflower Wild begins with a multiplier of x2 and will jump to a new position on the reels between each Cascade and respin.</p>
<p>Players may have a maximum of four Sunflower Wilds on the reels at a time. If more than one of these symbols is part of a winning combination, then their multipliers will first be multiplied together before being applied to the win.</p>
<p>The Water Drops symbol triggers a respin, and players may accumulate up to 5 respins in a meter beside the reels.</p>
<p>The Fertilizer symbol increases the multiplier of one Sunflower Wild by 1, while the Epic Fertilizer symbol increases the multiplier of all Sunflower Wilds by 1.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.35%, which is above our yardstick for average RTP of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Harvest Wilds slot</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>Coming in with high volatility Harvest Wilds is a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility farming-themed slot.</p>
<p>Harvest Wilds is a solid choice for mathematically-minded players given its robust RTP and high volatility. Meanwhile, its colourful animation and smooth gameplay make it a thoroughly engaging game.</p>
