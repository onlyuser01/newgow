    <h1>Seminole Casino Florida Doubledown Casino Free Chips 2023 Harrah S Metropolis Casino Jili Casino Fre</h1>

<p>Hi so all</p>
<p>the responsible gambling complaints with Gamdom are rejected does casino guru read the code of conduct on responsible gaming from the curacao licensing? I also have inside information and clear proof that Gamdom casino have some kind of deal with casino guru ? What’s the deal ? Why does there need to be a deal ( Gamdom casino knows who is who with the technology they have you and I both know that casinos have this technology I have screenshots of leaked casino guru emails to and from Gamdom about a other player they also scammed and I see your guy Adam siding with the casino isn’t this personal information? I have screenshots where a casino is asking another Casino about a player and they also telling them what he’s done how much he’s lost his wallet isn’t this breach of data I also took a look at a few members that work for guru and to my surprise they worked in casinos because some have even tested them ? So guru have the experience to know every single trick dirty tatic theses casinos use they target uk problem gamblers no kyc no aml no protection what so ever just greed and prey on mentality Ill gamblers I was in such a state once over Gamdom block my withdrawal after I won but I was still was done I called a high up from Gamdom and said give me my withdrawal it’s making me suicidal. And you want to know his reply (kill your self was his reply I have this on voice recording) now tell me that this is normal a man that’s lost everything is family his job his home and money and was told to kill my self . Now that’s what as made my head crazy I have spoke members of the uk government and there will be consequences if you think I’m just waffling I can send you the emails from the high up government that are looking into this because if gamdoms rating on casino guru are very high ? How comes didn’t they stop replying to you a while back ? And then suddenly come back and guru are like hey Gamdom here’s a excellent score ? Gamdom is also black listed on pogg do you know this ? There is also a fine of 5 million euros to the Spanish government im sure you also know this also as I’ve seen you reply in other threads about this they also do fake reviews on trusted pilot ( I also have this evidence) but guru seems to side with them ??? Isn’t this a prime example of favouring casinos I will like to speak to a casino guru employee via the phone would this be possible ? This needs sorting and I’m so angry Gamdom said message there legal team after I put a complaint into them after 8 weeks of asking them every week when will they reply they told me soon.just wait so I waited longer and then they said they won’t reply to me unless It’s from my lawyer like wtf what’s this all about some kind of joke so please tell me is this right ? They have pushed me into a metal state and now all of a sudden they ip banned me shouldn’t this of been done on my self exclusion? I’m done with all this bs and I’m going to do everything and anything in my power to expose them and when people look back and see that guru was promoting them giving them high score even though they know deep down how bad they are using uk streamers leaking data stealing money letting uk players play with self exclusion fucking with peoples business &lt; I have the proof also it’s really going to not look good for guru so please do not tell me Gamdom are a high rating</p>
