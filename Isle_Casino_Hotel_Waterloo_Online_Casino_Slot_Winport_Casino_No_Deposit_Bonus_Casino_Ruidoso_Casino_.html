<p>Arsenal Playing Very Well in 2024</p>
<p>The Gunners ended their 2023 campaign poorly with two losses in the EPL. However, they‚Äôve been doing okay in 2024. They won the two Premier League games they‚Äôve played so far this year, which got them back in the title conversation.</p>
<p>However, the teams they defeated aren‚Äôt real soccer heavyweights ‚Äì Nottingham and Crystal Palace. On the bright side, the Gunners put on a really good show in both of those games.</p>
<p>They completely dominated the game in Nottingham, winning 2-1 in the end. Against the Eagles, they scored five goals without allowing any. The reason this is important is that the game is question took place at Emirates Stadium, which is where they will welcome Liverpool on Sunday.</p>
<p>Liverpool Going for the EPL Title in Klopp‚Äôs Final Season</p>
<p>The big news coming from Liverpool is that coach Jurgen Klopp will leave the post at the end of the season. The best way to wrap up his Liverpool story would be to lead the Reds to another title.</p>
<p>This video will make you cry.</p>

<p>Right now, they‚Äôre on the good road to achieving that. These guys are 15-6-1 overall, which accounts for 51 points. The bad news is that the season is long, with another 16 games left for Klopp‚Äôs boys to play in the league.</p>
<p>The good news, however, is that these guys have been playing top soccer lately. They‚Äôre without a single loss in the Prem since September, with four wins in a row. The last time they failed to win a game in the EPL was in late December when they drew 1-1 with Arsenal at home.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs. Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams are playing great right now, which is what guarantees a real thriller on Sunday. We can definitely see both of them finding the net in this game, but it should be Liverpool that scores more. This team just looks stronger at the moment, not to mention that they‚Äôre super motivated to grab all three points.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool &amp; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
