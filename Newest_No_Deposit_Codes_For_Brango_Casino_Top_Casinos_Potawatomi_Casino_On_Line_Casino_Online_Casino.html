<p>Washington’s sports betting ecosystem just got busier, with two more tribes revealing that they are launching a dedicated betting platform. The tribes of Kalispel and Stillaguamish are joining the action with their Northern Quest and Angel of the Winds casinos, respectively.</p>
<p>After the Snoqualmie Tribe launched sports betting products live via Snoqualmie Casino, with the platform supplied by International Game Technology (IGT) in September, more tribes have since expressed similar intentions.</p>
<p>With 16 licensed Washington tribes legally permitted to do so, it’s easy to see why more sports betting stakeholders will be joining the industry before long. Washington Indian Gaming Association executive director Rebecca George welcomed the launch of sports betting in Washington State and praised the fact that this is happening with the help of the native tribes.</p>
<p>Promising Future for Tribal Communities and Betting</p>
<p>She argued that the launch of the new sports betting properties is important to the state tribes as they would be able to use the revenue to fund essential services for their communities. George added:</p>
<p>“Sports betting launched at Angel of the Winds in Arlington on Wednesday and will open for the general public tomorrow at Northern Quest in Airway Heights outside Spokane.” Washington Indian Gaming Association executive director Rebecca George</p>
<p>According to George, revenue from gaming has demonstrated its ability to significantly increase the economies of communities in Washington Tribes specifically. Furthermore, tribes will be personally engaged with regulating the betting operations that take place on their territory, offering a further safeguard against any of the negatives of gaming and gambling.</p>
<p>“Tribal gaming has a proven 30-year track record of success in Washington State, and all of the participating tribes have been careful in moving forward with the addition of sports betting.” Washington Indian Gaming Association executive director Rebecca George</p>
<p>George praised the decisiveness demonstrated during the 2020 legislative session, which resulted in a formal go-ahead for tribes to start offering sports betting at tribal casinos. She predicts a massive expansion of the activity in neighborhoods and communities, which should ultimately come to the benefit of both tribes and sports bettors.</p>
