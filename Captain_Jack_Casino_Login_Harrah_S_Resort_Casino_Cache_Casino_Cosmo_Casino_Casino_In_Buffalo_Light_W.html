<p>James will leave the gambling products and services corporation to explore other opportunities</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder will be parting ways with its chief financial officer Connie James. She will be temporarily replaced by Oliver Chow who will serve as interim CFO until the company finds a permanent successor.</p>
<p>As announced, James will depart from the company on August 25 and will explore opportunities outside of the gambling industry. She has been with Light &amp; Wonder for four years and has backed the company’s evolution and recent rebranding efforts.</p>
<p>Chow, who will temporarily succeed James, is Light &amp; Wonder’s senior vice president of corporate finance. He joined Light &amp; Wonder in October 2022 and boasts significant financial experience thanks to prior stints with other notable companies.</p>
<p>Chow’s track record includes a tenure as CFO of Aristocrat, as well as positions at companies such as Universal Pictures, Deluxe Entertainment Services and JP Morgan Chase.</p>
<p>Working with Light &amp; Wonder Was a Highlight of James’ Career</p>
<p>Connie James commented on her leave from the company. She shared that she really enjoyed working alongside a talented team and called her time with Light &amp; Wonder a highlight of her career.</p>
<p>James said that she enjoyed helping the company scale its business, evolve its capital allocation strategy and drive considerable efficiencies. According to the outgoing CFO, Light &amp; Wonder is now stronger, more flexible and poised for success.</p>
<p>I am confident that Light &amp; Wonder is well-positioned for continued success, and I am focused on ensuring a seamless transition over the coming months. Connie James, CFO, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Matt Wilson, Light &amp; Wonder’s chief executive officer, praised James for her spectacular work in advancing the company’s cultural and financial transformation. He said that it is thanks to her that the company now enjoys double-digit growth and a robust balance sheet.</p>
<p>She also helped us build a deep and talented finance team that will help provide a smooth transition to the next chapter of financial leadership within the company. On behalf of the Board and management team, I wish her well in her future endeavors. Matt Wilson, CEO, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>In the meantime, Wilson welcomed Chow as an interim CFO, saying that Light &amp; Wonder is fortunate to have such a suitable replacement. The CEO lauded Chow for his extensive experience in finance and gaming leadership.</p>
<p>Wilson concluded that Light &amp; Wonder trusts Chow to support the continued execution of the company’s financial priorities.</p>
