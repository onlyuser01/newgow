<p>The animals in the shelter will be able to feel more comfortable throughout the winter months while waiting to be adopted</p>
<p>Mount Airy Casino Resort, a property that prides itself on being the first AAA Four-Diamond casino resort in Pennsylvania, has launched a new initiative to help neglected animals. The casino will provide animals in a certain Pennsylvanian shelter with bedding that will ensure they are warm and comfortable.</p>
<p>As announced by Mount Airy, it will donate truckloads of its bed sets from the finest Egyptian cotton to a local animal shelter. These luxurious items, which the shelter would not otherwise have been able to afford, will help local animals feel better and warmer while waiting to be adopted.</p>
<p>The recipient of the casino resort’s charity is Camp Papillon, a non-profit, no-kill animal shelter in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. The shelter is currently struggling to keep its rescue dogs warm and comfortable throughout the cold winter months, which is why MGM Resorts’ donation comes at just the right time.</p>
<p>The Items Will Help Animals Feel Comfortable</p>
<p>Felicia Katz, the vice president of Camp Papillon, thanked Mount Airy for its commitment to helping the animals in need. She noted that the towels in particular would be very useful to dry animals after their baths. The comfort that these items will provide, Katz, says will make the animals calmer and more adoptable.</p>
<p>These linens foster relaxation and alleviate some of the stress that animals may experience when confined to a shelter. We know firsthand that calm animals are more adoptable animals. Felicia Katz, VP, Camp Papillon</p>
<p>Mount Airy’s chief operating officer and general manager, Ben Koff, also commented on the matter. He noted that the casino has always sought to benefit its local community and support its neighbors like they have supported Mount Airy.</p>
<p>Finding a way to reuse these quality linens while helping those in need represents Mount Airy’s dedication to regional nonprofits and our commitment to serving as responsible stewards of the environment. Ben Koff, COO, Mount Airy Casino</p>
<p>Mount Airy Is Committed to Helping the Local Community</p>
<p>This is not Mount Airy’s first charity initiative. Throughout the years, the casino resort has donated over a million dollars in cash grants, donations and community event sponsorships. Some of the initiatives that the casino has supported include Meals on Wheels and The Salvation Army among others.</p>
<p>The donation to Camp Papillon is not the only time Mount Airy has donated linens and bedding items either. As announced by the casino resort, bedding and linens have also been donated to Gracedale Nursing Home, Lehigh Valley Outreach, Monroe County Homeless Shelter and Metamorphosis Women’s Empowerment Initiative.</p>
<p>At the moment, Mount Airy is also working on another similar initiative that will see it give away hundreds of pieces of luggage, cookware, utensil sets, first aid kits, coffee makers and tote bags to local nonprofits. This initiative is part of its agreement with the Pocono Mountains United Way.</p>
