<p>Dallas Cowboys Coming to Landover to Win</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are 11-5 on the season and will play in the postseason no matter what. However, these guys wish to win the NFC East Division, as well as secure the No. 2 seed in the conference. For that, they just need to beat the Washington Commanders on Sunday.</p>
<p>Not only do they have a much better roster than the Commanders, but they’re also in good form. Sure, they did lose two of their last three games, but those happened against teams that are much, much better than their next opponent – the Buffalo Bills and the Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>Plus, in their most recent game, they beat the high-flying Detroit Lions. It was a narrow win (20-19), but the Cowboys can be proud of their performance, especially in the defense. Keeping a team that’s averaging 26.9 points per game to 19 points is a great achievement.</p>
<p>Can Washington Commanders End Their Losing Run?</p>
<p>The Washington Commanders are 4-12 in the 2023-24 NFL, with their most recent win happening back in early November. That’s when they defeated the New England Patriots, who are one of the league’s worst teams.</p>
<p>In fact, all of Washington’s wins this season happened against teams that were under .500 when they played against them. When playing against stronger opponents, the Commanders don’t tend to do much. For example, in their previous duel with the Cowboys, they got smashed 45-10.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders Prediction</p>
<p>Are we going to see the Cowboys demolish the Commanders once again? We say yes! The boys from Dallas are in good shape, not to mention that they’ve got a lot of motivation to win this game.</p>
<p>That said, anything but a big win for the visitors would be a major surprise in our eyes. The Cowboys are going to win this game and cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Cowboys -13.0</p>
