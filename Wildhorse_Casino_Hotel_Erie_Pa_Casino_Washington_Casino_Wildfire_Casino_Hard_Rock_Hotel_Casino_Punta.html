    <h1>Wildhorse Casino Hotel Erie Pa Casino Washington Casino Wildfire Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta</h1>

<p>Hello to all potential readers,</p>
<p>I will not introduce myself without an apology. This is my first and probably last post, but because of this graphic thief, I had no choice but to register here on the forum and at least publicly add some valuable information/recommendation.</p>
<p>If I ignore the fact that by pure rotation of the reels (five columns in total), in which even a blind person can reliably recognize the programming with absurdly low results of the matching of symbols in the first three columns from the left necessary to win and in cases of occurrence of not one, but also several 'joker' symbols /wild', and which only by a really BIG mistake returns a profit higher than a measly ten times the deposit (minimum deposit CZK 5). It's probably not worth commenting more, you won't make a profit here, and every extra second spent on this garbage will only rob you more and more.</p>
<p>The main reason why I am writing this at all is the SPECIAL feature of the game - collecting 5 different types of BONUS stones, as the name of the game already suggests, where after collecting 5 stones of the same type, the WINNING BONUS is triggered, aka the moment that every player impatiently waits for and hopes for a real win.</p>
<p>Reality? Big shit. The win when triggering the 3-of-a-kind bonus (free spins, extra wild symbols, multiplier) is again absurdly ridiculous and unlikely to be higher than twenty times the bet, even though it takes 100 to 300 spins to reach these bonuses.</p>
<p>But you will never be able to start the other two types of stones and bonuses (mysteries, gold) with an expected higher win, because once you have 4 out of 5, the fifth last one simply won't give you it. No. From the start, the machine baits and gives, relatively quickly it gives you 4 and from that moment it just steals. When it should perhaps release, it will give you the message COMMUNICATION ERROR WITH THE SYSTEM/LOGIN ERROR.</p>
<p>For over two hours, I observed only FRAUD and non-stop spinning in a situation where I had collected 4 out of 5 stones for a mystery bonus with a value of 500x multiplier (which, according to mathematics for the first grades of elementary school, should yield a win that is not to be despised with a minimum bet of CZK 5) , then patience ran out. I consider waiting two hours for ONE, ONLY ONE FUCKED symbol and not seeing it as the pinnacle, and I don't believe that I would have seen it at all even if I continued with a smile for another three or four hours throwing fives instead of "out the window" into of this theft from the manufacturer ADELL.</p>
