    <h1>Funzpoints Casino Com Login Bobby Casino 200 Free Chip Quapaw Casino Evansville In Casino Casino At</h1>

<p>I was try to withdrawal my 200 euro, i have send all documents for KYC and it takes long time for casino to verify me.</p>
<p>I contact the casino several times and inform them i need help to protect my funds. Cuse im addicted and afraid of lose my money.</p>
<p>I ask for help to set an loss limit, but the chat support denied it and inform they dont offer This kind of service at This casino.</p>
<p>I inform that iam addicted to gaming and was afraid to lose the money and Ask if i could lock my account or selfexclude but still be able to Withdrawal my funds. The chat support told me they dont think so, and i need to send an email and Ask the finance team about that. So i did that. 2 days after, they still not have answer my email, they have not approved the KYC document and not proceed my Withdrawal.</p>
<p>i contact chat support again and told them i need help to protect my funds.</p>
<p>cuse i cand handle This and if they cant help me they need to take responsible if i lose the money.</p>
<p>one day after, i could not handle my self from playing and lose all the funds. They send so much offers and emails, i got really trigged from This.</p>
<p>i contact the casino about this and they blocked my account. But never answers my complaint, i also want them to Pay me the 200 i lost when they refuse to help me protect my funds.</p>
<p>i also Ask for my data, in support of GDPR.</p>
<p>now it has been one Month since my last email. I have still not got any reply on any of my emails, the complaint, i have not got the request data or funds.</p>
<p>the worst part is that im locked from all other casinos in This groupe due to addiction.</p>
<p>and when This casino blocked me, they still send me bonus offer and marketing email EVERY day, and i beg them to stop, but they ignore that to.</p>
