<p>The M&amp;A deal will help Entain provide customers with a broader offering of interactive content and experiences</p>
<p>Global sports betting, gaming and interactive entertainment group Entain has unveiled a new major acquisition. The company said that it has acquired all of the shares of 365scores, a global sports media company.</p>
<p>In the announcement, Entain said that the acquisition has cost it $150 million. In addition, Entain may have to pay up to $10 million in contingent payments.</p>
<p>Entain praised 365scores as “one of the world’s leading scores and sports media companies.” It noted that the business excels in providing scores and sports information. 365scores also provides editorial and social content and sports-focused free-to-play gaming titles.</p>
<p>Currently, 365scores has a fast-growing and engaged global audience of more than 15 million active users, Entain pointed out. The operator also noted that the scores company’s app currently ranks among the top 5 scores apps in the world.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Will Reinforce Entain’s Business</p>
<p>Entain noted that this acquisition will bolster Entain’s business, allowing it to provide better content and interactive offerings to its customers.</p>
<p>The combination of 365scores’ deep expertise in data-driven sports media content alongside Entain’s global scale and market-leading platform capabilities will provide customers with a broader offering of interactive content and experiences. Entain statement</p>
<p>The company added that this acquisition will help it secure additional growth opportunities that will support its ambitious global strategy.</p>
<p>Entain Continues to Grow and Improve</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, Entain also agreed to buy Sportsflare from Tiidal. The operator is set to acquire all shares of Tiidal’s subsidiary, Tiidal Gaming NZ, which operates Sportsflare.</p>
<p>Sportsflare, being a major provider of wagering products with a focus on the esports vertical, will further reinforce Entain’s offering. The agreement is still subject to approval from Tiidal’s shareholders. The future of the sale will likely be decided at a shareholder meeting scheduled for April 26.</p>
<p>In other news, Entain recently agreed to provide Gordon Moody’s Alumni Project with funding. The initiative, which will be entirely sponsored by the gambling giant’s non-profit arm, the Entain Foundation, will approach problem gambling in a new way.</p>
<p>The Alumni project will see people who have completed gambling treatment help others overcome their addiction. The initiative is a part of the ongoing efforts to further lower the problem gambling rates in Great Britain.</p>
<p>In early March, Entain posted its FY22 results, highlighting a successful year. The company’s gaming revenue sat at $5.17 billion, up 12% year-on-year. Commenting on the results, CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen said that Entain can look to the future with confidence.</p>
