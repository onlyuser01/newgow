<p>Daily fantasy and sports book operator DraftKings announced today it entered into a partnership deal with Bay Mills Resort &amp; Casino, to bring its mobile sports book app to sports fans across Michigan. Subject to the receipt of all applicable licenses and approvals, the Wolverine State is about to become the 8th, featuring the presence of DraftKings’ mobile sports betting app, joining the company of Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Sports Book Mobile App</p>
<p>The agreement for market access with the Bay Mills Indian Community will provide DraftKings with entry to a market where the sports book operator sees a lot of potential. A study among people in Michigan showed more than a third of the responders had already actively placed a legal bet via mobile, by either travelling to another state, or by using international sports book where permitted.</p>
<p>More than half of the participants in the study had never placed an online wager, highlighting hidden potential for the sports book operator in the form of casual bettors upon market entry. Being highly creative during the period with no sports, even offering betting on some unpopular sports and free-to-enter pool contest, DraftKings will definitely provide consumers with an innovative, immersive, and entertaining gaming experience once sports returns.</p>
<p>“Through a commitment to provide customers with a premier sports betting experience, DraftKings is happy to partner with Bay Mills Resort &amp; Casino. The Great Lakes State presents a number of gaming opportunities and we look forward to collaborating with Bay Mills to provide residents with the best-in-class experience DraftKings is known for.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>In-Person Betting</p>
<p>As part of the market access deal, the sports betting company will also operate a retail sports book in the tribal gaming property, making Michigan the 7th state to feature a DraftKings-branded retail sports book, joining Colorado, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York.</p>
<p>The operator of the casino resort, the Bay Mills Indian Community, hailed the signed partnership with DraftKings, as both sides match each other in their attempts to constantly look into options to expand the entertainment for their customers.</p>
<p>“We are excited about our new partnership with DraftKings. Expanding on what entertainment options we can offer at Michigan’s longest operating gaming facility is always our goal. Our new on-site DraftKings Sportsbook will be one more great reason for Michiganders to vacation with us in the Upper Peninsula.” Bryan Newland, Tribal Chairman, Bay Mills Indian Community</p>
<p>DraftKings will become the latest of the big online sports book operators to enter Michigan, following deals from rivals William Hill, partnering with the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, PointsBet with Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, and The Stars Group with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians.</p>
