<p>El Mariachi Slot Review</p>
<p>El Mariachi slot game is not shy about where it took inspiration from. The legendary movie Desperado starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek has found a new outlet in this creative slot game by Dragon Gaming. In the game, you will set out to explore the world of Mexican gunmen, a charming femme fatale, and a bonus round that is filled with multipliers, bonus features, sticky wilds, and re-spins.</p>
<p>A highly thematic experience from head to toe, El Mariachi will play easily, accommodate players of various bankrolls, and prove a truly outstanding and rewarding game from the moment you join it. Progressive bonus levels and decent payouts make El Mariachi slot game one of the best you will play today.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Desperado Written All Over</p>
<p>El Mariachi slot has taken its cue from Desperado, the iconic movie starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek in which El Mariachi, a famed gunslinger and guitarist portrayed by Banderas, returns home to a small border town in Mexico. The plot quickly spirals out of control when El Mariachi’s lover is murdered by a local drug lord, setting the man on a revenge quest.</p>
<p>The slot game is a little less gory than the flick, though, although the title is still designed to give you Mexican vibes, with the national flag waving softly in the air, and the setting of the game taking place in a bar – just the right spot for a Mexican standoff where guns are drawn, and nerves jarred.</p>
<p>You will be welcomed to a neatly designed game featuring a five-by-three grid. The spin button is a revolver’s cylinder, with an autoplay feature neatly tucked away. The low-paying symbols are designed as card suits, and the high-paying ones as characters from the movie. We will touch on the symbols in a moment.</p>
<p>El Mariachi Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>El Mariachi slot doesn’t have too many symbols you will have to worry about, and they are all straightforward to read. The low-paying ones are shaped like card suits, meaning diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades, and they will pay a fair bit based on how many you line up on the reels.</p>
<p>The high-paying symbols are the ones that depict characters from the movie itself, including El Mariachi, The Lady with the Rose, and the loathed Drug Lord who is seen as an antagonist of the slot and the show. Depending on which symbols you get, the payout will vary but there are some pretty nice ones.</p>
<p>The symbols pay from left to right, and Five Lady with the Rose would mean a payout of $1,000, and El Mariachi will pay just $300 for five. The Drug Lord himself will fetch you a $450 payline, whereas the other symbols, including the card suits, will pay $150 for five of each. These symbols are designed to be generous and fit both thematically and in terms of gameplay value.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>El Mariachi lives up to a high quality and standard when it comes to its visual and audio execution. The game is carefully wrought to follow the best industry practices, and it also follows Dragon Gaming’s signature style in crafting fresh and dynamic games.</p>
<p>El Mariachi Gameplay</p>
<p>El Mariachi offers quick and intuitive gameplay that can be picked right from the get-go. Players will have the ability to adjust their bet sizes using the intuitive menu at the bottom where you can quickly change the value of the coin value and cash bet size. Players can also see how many paylines are available to them, or 10 in this case.</p>
<p>You change the total bet size by actually adjusting the coin size with the help of the arrows. If you prefer to have several spins pre-loaded, you can do this as well and select a number of spins that you bet on and kickback watching the action unfold before you. If you suddenly feel the urge to max out your bet size, you can do so through a dedicated shortcut.</p>
<p>This pretty much sums up the gameplay in El Mariachi, making it an easy and intuitive game to handle no matter what your budget is.</p>
<p>El Mariachi Features: Wild Multiplier, Bonus, Jackpot Wheel</p>
<p>El Mariachi features a single great bonus game that is tiered to provide you with various rewards as you play along.</p>
<p>Free Spins Bonus Game: There are 10 free spins you can trigger with the scatter symbols, but you could easily get 15 or even 20 free spins if you end up with four or five scatters instead. As you play through the free spins, you will have the opportunity to access various rewards, that include additional free rounds that are added to the aggregate, sticky reels, and more.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Desperado Comes to Your Device</p>
<p>Whether you are a fan of the Desperado flick or the franchise as a whole, the El Mariachi slot game is a highly thematic and enjoyable title to try at any time. Fit to play on any device and powered by advanced HTML5 technology and crisp graphics.</p>
<p>The gameplay is rewarding and fun, and the game will play well with any budget, thanks to the betting limits you can calibrate any way you like. The ability to claim a few extra goodies during the free spins round is great, and although we would have loved to see more features in the game, we still think that Dragon Gaming did a good job all the same.</p>
