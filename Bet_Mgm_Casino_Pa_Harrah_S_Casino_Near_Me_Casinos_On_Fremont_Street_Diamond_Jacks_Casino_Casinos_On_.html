    <h1>Bet Mgm Casino Pa Harrah S Casino Near Me Casinos On Fremont Street Diamond Jacks Casino Casinos On</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for reviewing my complaint. It appears that my account was closed on the 17/07/22 and the money was lost from the 13/07/22 up until this closure. In my communications that I provided I outlined the need for a cooling off period and a statement on the 12/07/22 to close my account at winz as it was out of control. The requirements for casinos with curaçao gaming licenses in relation to responsible gambling state ''online casino operators should provide for several levels of "exclusion" from the game. The first is "cooling off", a short break for at least a month, the last is irrevocable self-exclusion. During the period chosen by the player, the operator must refuse the request to activate the account or create a new account. In this case, the withdrawal of funds should not be limited.''</p>
<p>Another requirement for responsibly gambling is for operators to encourage players to bet exclusively within rational limits that correlated with their own financial capabilities.</p>
<p>Development of algorithms and monitoring of stay on the gaming site – timers of time spent playing the game and so on.</p>
<p>In relation to this second statement, I have evidence of correspondence between myself and winz that outlines I was depositing and betting outside of rational limits and financial capabilities. I informed the casino that I was taking out a grant/loan to further my play and asked for an advance numerous times. This is also supported by the large amount of time I would spend gambling on their site, most hours of the day for consecutive days.</p>
<p>Another point I noticed on a prior complaint successfully resolved by winz casino for a player in a similar situation to myself is, upon their investigation, they discovered that the player had previously been identified to have severe compulsive gambling issues within Direx NV brands. In relation to myself, I have had my account involuntarily closed twice by mbit casino upon their suspicion of a compulsive gambling issue based upon my communication and gambling activities. I also have a current self exclusion in place with Bitstarz casino and have had my account closed at 7bit casino upon my request. These online casinos are all Direx NV brands. Perhaps winz casino are unaware of this, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw their handling of this players issue upon discovering this information.</p>
<p>If more evidence is required to substantiate the points I have made I am willing and able to provide them to you at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Mike.</p>
