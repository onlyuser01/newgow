<p>REEVO moves forward to make another splash in the iGaming sea with the company picking up the pace of integration and content distribution</p>
<p>The latest studio to join REEVO’s powerful B2B content and aggregation platform is ELA Games, a company that has been specializing in the development of exciting real-money games, offering robust mechanics, themes, and steady payouts.</p>
<p>Reevo Steals another March on Content with ELA Games</p>
<p>The company has already developed more than 14 titles of excellent slots, along with the studio’s live Claw Machines which further extend the opportunities for players to win real prizes and enjoy a fulfilling experience from start to finish. ELA Games brings excellent engagement tools to bear that allow players to further engage with the studio’s products and create worthwhile experiences for everyone’s participation.</p>
<p>The partnership will clearly give ELA Games a significant reach boost when it comes to new audiences and opportunities. REEVO in turn will be able to offer its own list of partners an extensive variety of games that are contributed to by ELA Games and other esteemed and hand-picked third-party studios with a robust profile in the industry.</p>
<p>REEVO head of sales Petra Maria Poola was very happy to see ELA join the list of partners for the company. She hailed the studio’s established track record in creating outstanding experiences and immersive games that fit right in with the broader content portfolio found at the aggregation platform. Poola added:</p>
<p>This will offer our customers even more choice and access to hundreds of best-in-class titles from REEVO and our third-party platform partners, all of which will take their casinos to the next level. REEVO head of sales Petra Maria Poola</p>
<p>ELA Games Excited about the Opportunities of the Tie-up</p>
<p>ELA Games director of gaming and business development Daniel Mitton welcomed the opportunity to further boost the studio’s reach with trusted partners and introduce its games to even more operators who are on the lookout for fun and engaging content. Mitton too is confident about the success the partnership will bring for ELA Games as the company is looking forward to securing further pull with operators.</p>
<p>“This is a milestone for ELA Games as we continue to work towards our mission of becoming one of the most renowned developers in the industry,” Mitton concluded. Reevo has been teaming up with a number of prominent companies of late, adding both Spinoro and Evolution as content partners.</p>
