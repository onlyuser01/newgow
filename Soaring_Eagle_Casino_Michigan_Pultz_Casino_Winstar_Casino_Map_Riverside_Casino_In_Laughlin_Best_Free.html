<p>Betfred Sports announced today its partnership with the We-Ko-Pa Casino Resorts in Arizona saw the introduction of self-service sports betting kiosks at the property operated by the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation.</p>
<p>Available at the Casino Floor and Sports Bar</p>
<p>The We-Ko-Pa Casino is now featuring eight self-service sports betting kiosks that allow players to wager on select sports markets, including pre-match, in-play and futures, utilizing straight bets, parlay cards, teasers and more. Sports bettors can even place additional bets with their winning tickets.</p>
<p>We are now one step closer to offering Arizona sports bettors a great betting experience with the new self-service kiosks at We-Ko-Pa Casino Resort. We look forward to opening the complete Betfred Sportsbook early next year.” Bryan Bennett, COO, Betfred Sports</p>
<p>We-Ko-Pa Casino placed half of the kiosks throughout the casino floor, with the remaining half located at the casino’s sports-themed dining outlet WKP Sports &amp; Entertainment, where sports fans and now bettors can enjoy craft beer in a typical pub atmosphere while watching football games, boxing, UFC and other major sporting events broadcast on enormous flat-screen TVs. The bar also organizes Football parties on Monday Nights.</p>
<p>When designing the We-Ko-Pa Casino Resort, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation wanted it to be the place to be for local residents and area visitors interested in the latest-and-greatest gaming options. Adding sports betting further helps us make our beautiful casino the one-stop gaming destination they envisioned.” Mary Ketterling, General Manager, We-Ko-Pa Casino Resort</p>

<p>The launch of the self-service kiosks powered by OpenBet’s retail technology and solutions marked another important step in the partnership between OpenBet and Betfred and is set to strengthen further with the launch of the complete Betfred Sportsbook early next year.</p>
<p>Commenting on the introduction of the betting kiosks, Open Bet COO Cathryn Lai outlined the exciting development that allowed the company to extend its presence in Arizona soon after the market opened, proud to be partnering with Betfred to bring “more safe and responsible sports betting experiences” to yet another US jurisdiction. “This latest launch epitomizes our ability to facilitate products for all kinds of operators thanks to our modular portfolio that caters to all demands,” she added.</p>
<p>Betfred Sports COO Bennett reiterated OpenBet remained the company’s choice of partner as it seeks to expand sports betting operations in the US, outlining OpenBet’s technology and retail solutions check all the requirement boxes for a “scalable, reliable and compliant platform.”</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to have opened these betting kiosks and look forward to working alongside OpenBet and the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation over the coming months to launch our complete sportsbook at the casino,” Bennett concluded.</p>
