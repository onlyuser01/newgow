    <h1>Skyline Hotel Casino Henderson Nv Casino Bristol Lucky Creek Casino Hi 5 Casino Captain Jack Casino</h1>

<p>Thursday, June 30 is when we’re going to witness the first Charlotte FC vs Austin FC duel in history. The two are newcomers to the MLS, with Charlotte playing its inaugural season this year. Austin FC, on the other hand, is playing its second MLS season, in which this team has huge ambitions. After finishing 12th in its first year, Austin FC is determined to qualify for the playoffs in 2022.</p>
<p>So far, the team from Texas has been doing great. Right now, these guys are sitting in the #3 position in the conference. The trouble is that there are several teams breathing by their necks, which is why they need to continue playing well if they want to make it to the postseason.</p>

<p>Charlotte FC Playing Great at Home</p>
<p>Charlotte FC is 6-2-9 (20 points) overall, currently sitting in the #9 position in the Eastern Conference. The reason why this team isn’t higher in the standings is that its away performances are nothing short of disappointing. At home, however, it’s a whole different story.</p>
<p>So far, Charlotte FC has won 18 points at home, which is second only to New York City in the conference. These guys have won six games so far, while losing two. At this point, they’re still without a single draw played at Bank of America Stadium.</p>
<p>Charlotte FC won their previous two home games, beating New York Red Bulls 2-0 and the Vancouver Whitecaps 2-1. Are we going to see them add a third win to the list?</p>
<p>Austin FC Playing Well on the Road</p>
<p>Home turf has huge importance in the MLS, with teams winning most of their points on their turf. On the road, there aren’t many teams that have been too impressive.</p>
<p>Austin FC, which is one of the best away teams in the Western Conference, has won just 13 points on the road so far. After playing eight away games, Austin FC scored a total of 12 goals, while allowing 13.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, their away form is pretty decent. In their previous five games on the road, they collected nine points, beating such MLS heavyweights as Houston Dynamo, Los Angeles FC, and CF Montreal.</p>
<p>Charlotte FC vs Austin FC Prediction</p>
<p>The first-ever clash between Charlotte FC and Austin FC is going to be a real barnburner – that’s our top prediction for this game.</p>
<p>What we mean by that is that there should be plenty of goal opportunities on both sides. We’ll probably see plenty of goals as well, but which team will score more? Probably neither. Instead, we believe a draw is the most likely outcome on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pick: Draw</p>
