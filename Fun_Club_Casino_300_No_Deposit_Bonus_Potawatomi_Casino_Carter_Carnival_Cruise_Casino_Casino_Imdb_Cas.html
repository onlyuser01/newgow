<p>Sports betting technology supplier Kambi Group announced today its sportsbook partnership with the owner of Parx Casino and betPARX, Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, has been extended.</p>
<p>Powering Growth for Its Partner</p>
<p>Kambi and the owner of the largest casino complex in Pennsylvania initially partnered in 2018 in a multi-year sportsbook agreement which provided Greenwood Gaming with Kambi’s cutting-edge sports betting platform, range of managed services and best-in-class land-based wagering experience to Parx Casino and later to a Parx-branded online sportsbook.</p>
<p>Under the extension deal, Kambi will continue to provide Greenwood Gaming with its best-in-class technology and services, including its award-winning BetBuilder product, across multiple US states and Kambi’s chief executive officer and co-founder Kristian Nylén was more than delighted to have secured the contract extension with the “valued partner.”</p>
<p>“Since we first partnered in 2018, it has been fantastic to watch betPARX grow from a local operator in the Philadelphia area to a nationally recognized brand, and I am pleased that Kambi will continue to support the operator on its journey as it expands further across the United States.” Kristian Nylén, CEO and Co-Founder, Kambi Group</p>
<p>Greenwood Gaming is currently present in Pennsylvania via Parx Casino where it is powered by Kambi and with retail partners Gun Lake Casino in Michigan and Freehold Raceway in New Jersey. Its wholly-owned interactive and mobile gaming subsidiary betPARX is live in the same three states and Ohio and is planning to expand into additional states in the future.</p>
<p>Matthew Cullen, senior vice president of Interactive Gaming and Sports at betPARX was thrilled to continue working with Kambi and continue to grow the brand nationally powered by Kambi’s “award-winning technology.”</p>
<p>Expanding US Presence</p>
<p>Recently named Sportsbook Platform Supplier of the Year at the EGR B2B Awards, the supplier of sports betting technology and managed services is currently live in 17 US jurisdictions and continues to affirm its position as the betting technology supplier of choice to operators across North America.</p>
<p>With a product range spanning from front-end user interface to odds compiling, risk management and customer intelligence, Kambi continues to attract tier-one operators worldwide. Kambi’s portfolio of clients features ATG, Churchill Downs Incorporated, Penn National Gaming, Rush Street Interactive, LeoVegas, Kindred Group, and others.</p>
<p>In May, Kambi teamed with Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment, the business arm of the Mohegan tribe, to provide its mobile betting solutions to Fallsview Casino in Ontario Canada where the market officially launched the month before.</p>
