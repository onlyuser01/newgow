    <h1>Clearwater River Casino Closest Casino Motor City Casino Hotel Blue Chip Casino Hotel Michigan City</h1>

<p>Hello Christina, I am contacting you because I know that you can help solve this problem, your site helped my loved ones solve problems when they contacted you, so I ran into a name when I needed your help, the thing is that Bongo Casino deceived me as a player , literally yesterday, on 02.10.2022, I applied for a deposit and tried to make a deposit through the bank with a Monobank card, but since the martial law of the NBU in Ukraine prohibits a number of operations, such as currency conversion. So I asked a question about how I can make a deposit on this site, they answered me that I can use cryptocurrency, I asked how things were going with the withdrawal in the case of an application, I was told that in most cases these operations take place instantly. I also asked if there were any difficulties with withdrawing cryptocurrencies to a crypto wallet, they answered me that there were no difficulties. So in the evening, at about 21:30, I nevertheless made a deposit of 52USDT, and already somewhere around 02:30 on the night of 03.10.22 I tried to make a withdrawal, but it was rejected!!!! When contacting the support chat, they answer me that there were difficulties with the withdrawal, to my indignation that there weren’t any, they answered me yes, there really were no difficulties at the time of contacting, but you must admit it looks extremely strange, I corresponded with them after 18:00. 10/02/22 and 10/03/22 already difficulties!!!! I think so or they were, and this fact the chat operator simply gave incorrect information, but more than that, I think that they simply deceive me and in fact there were no and no difficulties at all, the withdrawal amount is 216USDT. And pay attention to the fact that their internal rate is undervalued !!! When making a deposit in the amount of 2300 UAH in USDT 52= in UAH 1.921 UAH. When I wrote why so little on the balance sheet shows in UAH, they answered that such an internal rate, although it is not even displayed anywhere, I play a lot on sites and they also showed them the sites where I play, making it clear that they won’t be able to throw me, I hope for your help. I will show you a screen where you can see how another chat operator answers me that there were no difficulties at the time of the appeal !!!!</p>
