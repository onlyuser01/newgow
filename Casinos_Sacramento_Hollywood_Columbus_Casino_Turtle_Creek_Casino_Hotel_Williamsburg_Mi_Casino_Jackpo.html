<p>The new custom-tailored version of Skyward is expected to deliver unrivaled experiences for Betway customers in Africa</p>
<p>The leading provider of games for the online gambling industry, BetGames, announced the launch of a new branded version of Skyward, its hit plane-themed crash game. On Tuesday, the company confirmed that the new branded version of its hit game was created for the leading global gaming and betting operator, Betway. Thanks to the new game, the operator will bring exciting and unique experiences to its growing number of customers in Africa.</p>
<p>The new branded version of Skyward is optimized to ensure lightweight and stable operation, explained BetGames. Such features are incredibly important for certain gambling jurisdictions where low data consumption is a challenge for gambling operators. Undoubtedly, the tailored version of Skyward is going to strengthen the offering of Betway. Moreover, the collaboration helps propel the reach of BetGames, allowing the company to reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Skyward was the first crash title from BetGames. The online gambling industry content supplier tapped into this popular vertical, delivering a title that stands out with engaging gameplay and convenient features like auto-betting and cash-out.</p>
<p>Hailee Cook, Betway Africa’s product manager, spoke about the company’s previous collaborations with BetGames. Moreover, she highlighted that Betway is excited to once again team up with the leading iGaming supplier for the delivery of the branded Skyward hit game. Finally, Cook said: “We strive to bring our customers the finest and most innovative gaming content and our alliance with BetGames continues to deliver that.”</p>
<p>“We’ve engaged BetGames to develop a number of bespoke projects for us and again, we’re delighted with the results. Having the latest games presented with our familiar environment and feel is important to our loyal players and Skyward hits that mark again.“ Hailee Cook, product manager for Betway Africa</p>
<p>The iGaming Supplier Is Excited to Deliver Content for Betway</p>
<p>The partnership with Betway in Africa comes after BetGames inked another important partnership earlier this year. Back in September, the company teamed up with SOFTSWISS, agreeing to deliver its games for the company’s Game Aggregator. This strategic content agreement represented a milestone achievement for the two companies and positioned them well for further expansion.</p>
<p>“The launch of Skyward has heralded a further exciting step in the evolution of our content portfolio.“ James Everett, VP sales Africa at BetGames</p>
<p>BetGames’ VP sales Africa, James Everett, spoke about the importance of the release of Skyward which marked the start of the company’s content evolution. “Using it as the base for our latest bespoke project for Betway has really strengthened the fantastic relationship we enjoy with one of the industry’s biggest names,” he added. Finally, Everett explained that BetGames remains committed to growing its partnership with Betway and delivering unrivaled experiences for its players.</p>
