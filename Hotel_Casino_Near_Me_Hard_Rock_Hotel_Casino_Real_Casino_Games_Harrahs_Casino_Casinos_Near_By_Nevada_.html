<p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board’s (NGCB) monthly update revealed that operators in the Silver state won $1.22 billion, extending its billion-dollar streak to 21 months. Despite yearly revenue set to smash 2021’s record-setting profits, the recent slide may signal an end to Nevada’s seemingly unstoppable momentum.</p>
<p>November’s Results Elicited Mixed Emotions</p>
<p>November’s $1.22 billion total gaming revenue marks an impressive achievement for Nevada’s casinos. The state’s gambling industry smashed 2021’s results, easily surpassing them with a month to spare. Nevada casinos already made $13.5 billion, 100 million more than last year’s $13.4 billion. December’s results should push that number past $14 billion, setting a new record for the Silver State.</p>
<p>However, not everything is sunshine and rainbows for Nevada’s casinos. Despite robust November revenue, the number still marks a 7.62% year-on-year decrease. The Las Vegas Strip suffered the most, recording a significant 11% gross gaming revenue (GGR) drop to $669.5 million. NGCB chief economic analyst Michael Lawton remained optimistic, noting that yearly growth was fantastic despite the recent downturn.</p>

<p>Despite Lawton’s reassurances, official metrics remain worrying. Sparks, South Lake Tahoe, and Wendover were the only areas experiencing a net year-on-year growth. The Strip, which contributes the most to the state’s gaming market, underperformed. Table games suffered the most, with baccarat plummeting by 37% and blackjack revenue dropping by 26%. The 2% slots increase was not enough to offset these losses.</p>
<p>Nevada’s sportsbook revenue fell woefully short of November 2021’s $72 million, landing at just $37.7 million. The staggering 48% drop is partially the result of Mattress Mack’s $75 million victory, whose aftermath continues to reverberate across several states. Even without the significant payouts, overall metrics remained unimpressive.</p>
<p>Nevada’s Streak May Be Heading to an End</p>
<p>The overall industry slowdown appears to match the analysts’ September forecasts. Hospitality-focused consulting firm B Global predicted that growing pressures like rising inflation and domestic factors would negatively impact the market. However, they estimated that the gambling industry would at least maintain its billion-dollar streak until the end of the year, meaning that the coveted $14 billion yearly revenue target is still safe.</p>
<p>The state’s new $12 minimum hourly wage should provide a safety net for workers but is generally not expected to impact casino revenue. Conventional economic wisdom dictates that profits cannot rise forever. Every boom eventually leads to a bust, meaning Nevada’s casinos should likely take measures to prepare for a potential downturn. December’s results will show whether this month’s drop was a one-off occurrence or the start of a worrying trend.</p>
