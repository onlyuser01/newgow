<p>Stats Perform, a global sports data technology and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven firm unveiled today five new products for sports betting operators that would elevate bettor experience.</p>
<p>‘Light Up Your Sportsbook’</p>
<p>The range of new products revealed at the “Light Up Your Sportsbook” online event leverages live streaming, player stats bets, same-game multis, and other sports betting experiences to create a more informative and engaging environment for bettors.</p>
<p>“Our new products mark a seismic shift in the ability of licensed betting operators to provide relevant, betting-tailored sports content to their audiences. They create highly contextual, personalised and more entertaining experiences across the sportsbook as a result.” Andrew Ashenden, Chief Betting Officer, Stats Perform</p>
<p>Stats Perform introduced two products, Instant Highlights and Smart Stats Overlays, aimed at the company’s popular Watch&amp; Bet live video service that was also re-launched as Bet LiveStreams.</p>
<p>Instant Highlights allows any sports bettor, who has joined a live game after the action has commenced, to watch action replays of key game moments on-demand, while Smart Stats Overlay brings up in real-time contextual, sports betting Opta stats and insights over the top of the live stream to create a next-level experience for the audience.</p>
<p>“Sportsbooks can use these new products to build genuinely disruptive, personalized, and informative experiences, throughout a bet’s lifecycle,” said vice president of Betting Products at Stats Perform Nick Cockerill.</p>
<p>“It’s the biggest leap forward in access to player stats and on-field action in sports betting history, which makes it so much easier and more engaging for bettors to find and then enjoy their bet.” Nick Cockerill, VP, Betting Products, Stats Perform</p>
<p>Leverage AI and Opta Stats</p>
<p>The remaining three new products are aimed at helping sports betting operators inform more broadly and deeply bettors by utilizing AI and Stats Perform’s reliable Opta data across their sportsbooks’ functionalities.</p>
<p>Dynamic Betting Stats API allows sportsbooks to “help bettors find, track and manage their bet from millions of player stats, multis and bet builder combinations,” while Automated Betting Insights generates bite-sized pre-game and in-play analysis for specific betting markets. The third innovation, Automated Betting Previews, delivers pre-game and half-time written or video previews for hundreds of thousands of events.</p>
<p>“Customers tell us that betting is more entertaining when it’s complemented by engaging content, displayed at the right time,” Cockerill continued, emphasizing the potential of Stats Perform’s “new, tailored betting content” to “light up sportsbooks.”</p>
<p>The sports data technology business had a busy start of 2022, expanding its footprint with several strategic sports organizations partnerships, including the NFL and NCAA and the Thailand Football Association, and also became the first to renew its Data Standards accreditation with the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA).</p>
