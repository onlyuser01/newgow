<p>Interactive gaming and sports betting technology company Elys Game Technology announced Thursday an agreement with Entitlement Restaurant and Cigar Lounge in Washington, D.C. to operate a sportsbook at the venue.</p>
<p>Elys Expands Restaurant and Bar Sportsbooks</p>
<p>The agreement with Entitlement Restaurant and Cigar Lounge in Washington, D.C. will see Elys’s wholly-owned subsidiary USBookmaking power the sportsbook location with bookmaking services and manage the sportsbook risk.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Elys’ executive chairman Michele Ciavarella outlined that the agreement with Entitlement Restaurant and Cigar Lounge marked the fifth sportsbook location for the innovative technology supplier, expanding its footprint across bars and restaurants in DC as expanding into neighboring states is expected to take place over the coming months.</p>
<p>“We believe that adding sports wagering within an exciting environment where patrons can enjoy their favorite food and beverages could bring an entirely new vibe to the establishment and could drive ancillary revenue and foster employment opportunities for small businesses.” Michele Ciavarella, Executive Chairman, Elys Game Technology</p>
<p>Elys began executing its small business strategy based on white label sportsbooks in restaurants and bar venues by launching a retail sportsbook location at the Grand Central Restaurant and Sportsbook in the Adams Morgan area of Washington, D.C. in October 2021.</p>
<p>In February, The Toronto-based technology firm received a green light from the DC Office of Lottery and Gaming, Regulation and Oversight Division to expand its operations at the location.</p>
<p>‘Affirmation of Scalability and Flexibility’</p>
<p>Similar to Grand Central in the Adams Morgan area, Entitlement is a full-service restaurant located in one of the DC’s trendiest communities in the Petworth district, serving a variety of traditional American food and beverages within a socializing and networking environment.</p>
<p>“Partnering with Entitlement provides further affirmation of the scalability and flexibility of the Elys retail sportsbook solution and is a key driver in our pathway to profitability and development of long-term shareholder value in Elys Game Technology.” Michele Ciavarella, Executive Chairman, Elys Game Technology</p>
<p>Pending licensing, Entitlement will become the fifth restaurant and bar sportsbook in Washington, D.C. powered by Elys’ sportsbook technology to offer its visitors sports betting opportunities while enjoying the comfort and ambiance of the establishment.</p>
<p>The agreement with Entitlement is valid for three years from the date of obtaining the license and has the option to be extended twice for two more years each time.</p>
