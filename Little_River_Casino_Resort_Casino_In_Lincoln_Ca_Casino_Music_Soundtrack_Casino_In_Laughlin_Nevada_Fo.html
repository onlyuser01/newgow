    <h1>Little River Casino Resort Casino In Lincoln Ca Casino Music Soundtrack Casino In Laughlin Nevada Fo</h1>

<p>I already thought that you would stick to the casino, since Casino Guru is not about player protection either.</p>
<p>What exactly did it take you 5 days to do? To pick out a ridiculous part of the terms and conditions. Are you serious?</p>
<p>I really thought you contacted the casino and demanded the chat log or that you actually have contacts with the management and are asking them for a good solution.</p>
<p>By the way, it is very ridiculous that they dismiss my complaint about this passage, as it is perfectly normal that when you are banned from one company for gambling addiction, they are banned from ALL of those casinos.</p>
<p>Otherwise, player protection would be a sham as there are over thousands of unique casinos and hundreds of new casinos are added every week and month. In the last 6 months alone, Casino Guru has listed over 300 new casinos on the site. How can someone who is addicted to gambling get banned from 5,000 casinos? Are you serious? Should a gambling addict spend all day just blocking out casinos?</p>
<p>It's very clear. Spinsbro and iWildCasino belong to Altacore NV and a ban for gambling addiction must always affect the entire group. Otherwise there is no real player protection and Casino Guru supports that people who are addicted to gambling are not protected.</p>
<p>Spinsbro support confirmed to me that a ban applies to the entire group, which makes perfect sense. If you are actually on the side of the casino in this case, then I will hire a lawyer who will not only take action against the casino, but also against Casino Guru. They pretend to want to help players but are actually on the side of the casinos. By the way, I hope you know that it is illegal to make your site accessible to Austrian and German residents and to show non-German-licensed providers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all chat logs must be saved and there you will also find my chat with iWildCasino, where I write from Gambling Addicted.</p>
<p>In any case, I find your answer to be an absolute impertinence. Make me wait 5 days and then send me a meaningless excerpt from the terms and conditions. What an impertinence.</p>
<p>What did you do the 5 days? Have you contacted management, have you asked for an amicable solution, have you had any contact with anyone there? Or did you simply copy a section from the terms and conditions in a 1-minute "research"?</p>
<p>I really hope that an amicable solution can be found here. I would also accept a certain % amount to be paid back to me. But I'm concerned here with the principle and I will follow this case 100% to the end and will not give up and call in a lawyer in the next few days if a solution is not found quickly.</p>
