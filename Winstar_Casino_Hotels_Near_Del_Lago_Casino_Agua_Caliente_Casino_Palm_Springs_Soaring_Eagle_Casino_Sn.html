<p>The fast-growing content provider for the online gambling industry, Pragmatic Play, expanded further its global footprint after announcing a new partnership. The company said Wednesday it inked a new content deal with Track and Races, a popular Venezuelan operator.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the recently signed collaboration, the Venezuelan operator will benefit from Live Casino and Slot content from the leading iGaming industry content provider. Besides Live Casino and Slots, Track and Races will benefit from products within Pragmatic Play's Virtual Sports vertical, a statement released on February 15, 2023, reveals.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the fresh deal, the gambling operator will tap into Pragmatic Play Virtual Sports games such as Fantastic League football, as well as dog and horse racing. Those titles are expected to deliver unique experiences for the customers of the operator, considering their leading technology and authentic feel.</p>
<p>Additionally, the aforementioned collaboration includes Live Casino content from Pragmatic Play. As a result of the deal, Track and Races will gain access to popular gameshow titles such as Sweet Bonanza CandyLand and Mega Wheel, as well as classic casino games such as Blackjack and Roulette.</p>
<p>Thanks to the partnership, Track and Races customers will also access Pragmatic Play's multi-award-winning games including Gates of Olympus, as well as Octobeer Fortunes and Book of Golden Sands, among other engaging slots titles.</p>
<p>Carlos Gonzalez a representative for Track and Races, commented saying: "It’s difficult to find an operator in the market that doesn’t carry Pragmatic Play’s content so ensuring we offer the widest range of gaming and betting experiences for our customers is hugely important." Finally, he said that the company is looking forward to collaborating with Pragmatic Play's team for the introduction of new and engaging games.</p>
<p>The new collaboration significantly boosts the operator's offering. This, in turn, is expected to help with customer retention and acquisition while at the same time delivering benefits for Track and Races.</p>
<p>What's more, the new deal further expands Pragmatic Play's presence into the Latin American region. The company has recognized the potential of the market which resulted in multiple partnerships inked recently. In fact, only last week, Pragmatic Play boosted its LatAm footprint by signing a deal with Vibra Gaming.</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the new deal with Track and Races, Pragmatic Play's Vice President of Latin American Operations, Victor Arias, said: "Venezuela is another important region for the Pragmatic Play team in LatAm, and Track and Races represents another valuable alliance through which we can maintain our reputation of providing the best in online casino entertainment."</p>
