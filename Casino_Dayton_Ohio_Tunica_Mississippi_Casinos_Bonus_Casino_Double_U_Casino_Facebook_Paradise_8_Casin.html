<p>Fire Archer review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fire Archer is themed around a Robin Hood-like archer.</p>
<p>Players will follow a band of outlaws into a dense forest, where they’ll learn the art of flaming archery. With a little help from a handsome woodsman, they’ll go on a quest to rob the rich and feed the poor.</p>
<p>This slot will appeal to fans of medieval fantasy, and anyone who has wished to join Robin Hood’s band of Merry Men.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Fire Archer’s soundtrack is an uplifting melody that brings to mind a royal parade. The chirping of birds helps to reinforce the woodsy setting as well.</p>
<p>The reels display colorful banners in jewel tones of blue, red, green, and purple. Each one displays a letter drawn in elegant calligraphy.</p>
<p>Among the symbols, players will also find sacks of gold and the fire archer himself, poised with his arrow aimed out of the reel. His green feathered hat appears as well, prompting players to think of Robin Hood once again.</p>
<p>In the background, there is a leafy wood, a castle in the distance, and the fire archer standing roguishly with his bow lowered. His flirtatious gaze meets the player’s as he sways slightly, much like a video game character waiting for direction.</p>
<p>Together, the soundtrack and animation create a medieval forest fantasy.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fire Archer is a five-reel, five-row slot, with 25 win lines.</p>
<p>Players can buy into the Free Spins feature by paying 100x their current bet.</p>
<p>The maximum win possible in this slot is 4,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Super Wild symbol also substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. The Super Wild symbol appears on all reels and has the special ability to show 8 directions around it. This means that whenever it appears, 1 to 8 directions will randomly be highlighted and Wilds will be added to the reels in those directions.</p>
<p>Scatters land on reels 1, 3, and 5, and if players land 3 Scatters, the Free Spins feature begins. The feature begins with 5 free spins and there is a guaranteed Super Wild on the screen until the feature concludes. This Super Wild jumps to a randomly chosen position for each spin, and no other Super Wilds may land.</p>
<p>When the Free Spins feature begins, the roaming Super Wild is assigned a randomly selected value between 1 and 8. Then, a number of directions are highlighted and Wilds are added in those directions, replacing any existing symbols.</p>
<p>For every 2 Scatters that land during the Free Spins feature, the Super Wild value will increase, and 1-3 additional free spins are awarded at random.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Fire Archer is 95.12%, decisively below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€125 per spin.</p>
<p>Coming in with high volatility, Fire Archer would have been a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies if it offered a higher RTP. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility medieval archery-themed slot.</p>
<p>Although the heroic Robin Hood-inspired character is appealing, Fire Archer’s RTP is simply too low to merit a recommendation.</p>
<p>Players might drop in to enjoy the game world and explore the bonus features, but they would be wise to move on to slots that can offer a more favorable RTP.</p>
