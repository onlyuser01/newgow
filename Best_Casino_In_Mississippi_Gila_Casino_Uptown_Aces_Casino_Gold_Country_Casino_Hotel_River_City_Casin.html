    <h1>Best Casino In Mississippi Gila Casino Uptown Aces Casino Gold Country Casino Hotel River City Casin</h1>

<p>If you'd need a further assistance in above mentioned efforts, please feel free to reach me via email, on my address: 'martin.d@casino.guru'.</p>
<p>When you will successfully manage to file a complaint with the Licensing Authority, please let us know here. As our conclusion to this case was already made, we will have to close this complaint.</p>
<p>Regarding the contact of Betconstruct game provider, sadly we do not communicate with game providers on regular basis. The best thing I can suggest for you is to contact this email address: 'david.ozararat@betconstruct.com'. According to their website, David is regional director for France, Monaco, Switzerland, BeNeLux countries and French speaking countries.</p>
<p>Please, it is necessary for you to include following:</p>
<p>We are not able to invite any Licensing Authority into our complaint's threads. You need to contact them on your own. I will write you some instructions here.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that you tried to resolve the complaint here is one of the necessary steps, to file a complaint about casino with the Licensing Authority.</p>
<p>When you decide to raise the complaint further, the Licensing Authority will also be able to access the same documentation and maybe even more than we did. That is why in case of your dissatisfaction you should do it.</p>
<p>I completely understand that you would like to see the documents for yourself, however in this case we are not able to make any move. It is up to casinos to decide to whom they provide such information.</p>
<p>As I said earlier the documentation provided to us was confidential and we do not disclose these to anyone, the casinos provide us often with some evidence, only to have a better insight and to help us make any conclusion and we are not able to share it publicly or to anyone.</p>
