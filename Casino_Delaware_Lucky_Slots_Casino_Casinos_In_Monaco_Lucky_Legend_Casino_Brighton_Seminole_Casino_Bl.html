<p>The online entertainment industry leader in North America, Blazesoft, confirmed it was awarded the Great Place to Work certification from the Great Place to Work Institute Canada. Details regarding the latest recognition emerged last week and the announcement comes after the company has gone through a rigorous evaluation process conducted by the Institute.</p>
<p>The prestigious certification underlines the positive feedback of Blazesoft's employees, combined with an analysis of the company's culture. Ultimately, securing the Great Place to Work certification designates Blazesoft as an outstanding employer that fosters a workplace culture of inclusivity, collaboration and friendliness.</p>
<p>The latest certification reaffirms the strength of the company's core values and strong workplace culture. Additionally, Blazesoft is recognized by its employees for its competitive compensation packages, as well as career development opportunities and benefits like workplace initiatives and advanced medical care.</p>
<p>Mickey Blayvas, Blazesoft's CEO, commented on the topic in a statement. "We are honored to receive the Great Place to Work certification, validating our ongoing efforts to create a workplace where every team member feels valued and recognized," he explained.</p>
<p>Blayvas said that it is delighting to be a part of a fast-growing business in Canada that recognizes the importance of inclusivity and outstanding work culture. "Our culture influences the way we work, rather than us trying to influence it; we're creating a true community. With the certification, I am certain we will continue to attract top candidates," he explained in conclusion.</p>
<p>Nancy Fonseca, Great Place to Work Canada's Senior Vice President, was similarly excited. She outlined that employees recognize companies as a great place to work based on the efforts of their leaders, their relationships with their colleagues as well as the pride they have in their jobs. "Our data shows that great workplaces benefit from stronger financial performance, reduced turnover, and better customer satisfaction than their peers," added Fonseca.</p>
<p>Yuliy German, SVP of Strategic Initiatives at Blazesoft, was similarly thrilled regarding the latest recognition. "I have had the privilege of being a part of this incredible company for some time now, and I am continually amazed by the exceptional culture, dedicated team, and the outstanding benefits it offers," he added.</p>
<p>German praised Blazesoft's employees, explaining that they collaborate with each other perfectly and quickly become friends. "The strong sense of unity and collective achievement is evident in every project we undertake," explained the company's SVP of Strategic Initiatives in conclusion.</p>
