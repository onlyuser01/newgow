<p>STS Holding, the leading sports betting company in Poland and Europe, has announced that it included horse racing to its offering for customers in the UK.</p>
<p>Under a New Deal, STS Includes Horse Racing for UK Customers</p>
<p>The recent expansion was facilitated thanks to a deal inked between STS, Pythia Sports and At The Races (ATR) Markets. Thanks to the collaboration, the duo will support STS by offering live stream video and data, risk management and pricing for horse racing in the UK.</p>
<p>Additionally, the collaboration will see STS launch live streaming greyhound and horse racing content from international as well as domestic racecourses for its customers. Thanks to the expanded betting options, the company’s players will also be able to watch and bet on the races by using a mobile device or the operator’s website.</p>
<p>Founded in 1997, STS Holding has proven to be a leading bookmaker in Europe. Besides the UK, the company operates in Estonia as well. Moreover, when it comes to turnover, the company is currently the largest licensed bookmaker in Poland. In addition to sports betting, STS offers online casino entertainment, esports and virtual sports betting.</p>
<p>The Company Remains Focused on Growing</p>
<p>STSBet’s managing director, Filip Sosnowski, said the company plans to continuously collaborate in the coming months with ATR Markets. He explained that ultimately, STS is looking to “enhance the product further by adding additional features plus adding to the available content, including international racing from other territories.” In conclusion, Sosnowski revealed that the company’s customers will be able to enjoy special bets and regular horse racing promotions.</p>
<p>“We will offer regular horse racing promotions, special bets and different offers for our customers.” Filip Sosnowski, managing director at STSBet</p>
<p>The company’s expansion in betting offers for the UK comes after earlier this month, STS reported a significant growth during 2021. During last year, the company’s NGR increased to a record PLN 565 million ($132 million). In contrast, during 2020, STS’ NGR halted at PLN 434 million ($102 million). This marks a significant increase of 30% year-over-year.</p>
<p>ATR’s head of commercial operators, Chris Dilley, added that the company is delighted to join forces with STSBet. Moreover, he said that ATR is looking forward to helping STSBet grow thanks to offering “a top-class racing product which will help establish them in the UK market.”</p>
