    <h1>Harvey Casino Bomb Casinos Near Memphis Tn Caesars Palace Casino Metropolis Casino Casino Niagara Fa</h1>

<p>Dear damtrongthucthuc,</p>
<p>Now it is clear that the casino will likely not help us in resolving your issue much.</p>
<p>Despite the fact your account is blocked, based on all the provided information, we are able to accept situations when casinos can pay the players' winnings in another way, via an alternative payment method, since the variety and accessibility of payment methods are not managed by the casino exclusively. Several factors as the Licensing Authority, geolocation, contracts with the payment providers, and bank restrictions, all have a major influence. If, for example, a particular payment method was available for deposits, it does not mean necessarily, that it will be offered for withdrawals too.</p>
<p>If you have been advised by the casino to use an alternative payment method to withdraw your winnings, I would have strongly recommended following their instructions. Unfortunately, casinos are sometimes powerless and limited in offering payment methods to their customers, and in this case, it looks like there were several payment methods available for you to withdraw your balance/winnings, and it is not clear what was the real reason your account has been blocked/closed.</p>
<p>Although we try to help the players with their issues, we also require their full cooperation.</p>
<p>There are still questions that were directed to you and have not been answered yet. I would like to repeat them again, and I will require all details from you. In addition, there is also one more detail that it would be good to verify on our side.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, while we will wait for the casino's response, could you please provide me with the information on whether you tried to withdraw your remaining balance by any alternative payment method? In the screenshot provided, I can see the casino advised you to use another payment method - what payment methods were available in your cashier for a withdrawal at the time your account was active?"</p>
<p>And another detail - can you please send me the same screenshots as you shared above, but with your email address clearly visible in the screenshots? Alternatively, you can do it as follows:</p>
<p>Open your email inbox in one of the well-known and common internet browsers on a PC, click the right mouse button on each email conversation between you and the casino, choose the option "Forward as an attachment" from the drop-down, and send all of them to my email address (branislav.b@casino.guru)</p>
<p>If I did not overlook anything, we have not been provided with any email communication (screenshot) stating your account was closed or blocked and why, so it would be highly appreciated if you could also send such an email to me</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
