<p>Information about UPI casinos</p>
<p>United Payments Interface (UPI) is an instant payment system set up by a group of Indian banks and managed by the Indian government. It merges multiple banking networks into a single app, allowing customers of the participating banks to send money between themselves and pay for online goods.</p>
<p>Websites that accept this method include many UPI online casinos, and this page will show you how to find the best UPI sites using Casino Guru's rating system and filters.</p>
<p>You can also read about UPI's history, the pros and cons of using the service, and how to find bonuses offered by UPI casinos.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>UPI – an Indian collective aimed at making instant payments more accessible</p>
<p>In 2012, the Royal Bank of India released a four-year vision that aimed to build a safe, efficient, and accessible national payment system. It was motivated by the thriving cash black market across the country, and by the fact that around 145 million families had no banking facilities.</p>
<p>The RBI delivered on its plan. In 2016, the recently formed National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) - managed by the bank – launched the United Payments Interface. The service focussed on simplicity: users only needed a unique identifier, known as a UPI ID, and the recipient's ID, to make a transaction. This was a far cry from traditional services, which put people off with their complicated procedures.</p>
<p>With users able to send money and make payments in a matter of seconds, UPI grew exponentially over the next few years. It had become the world's largest real-time payment provider by 2020, with over 25.5 billion transactions in just that one year.</p>
<p>Its success has led to other nations, including the United States, Singapore, and several EU countries, trying to emulate UPI with their own national systems.</p>
<p>With plans to achieve a customer base of 500 million people within the next few years, UPI shows no sign of slowing down. Revolutionary new technologies, such as a voice-based payment service, are in the pipeline and help to ensure that UPI remains a leader in its field.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of UPI casinos and payments</p>
<p>To give a balanced assessment of UPI's service, we're going to use this section to detail the positives and negatives you should expect once you sign up.</p>
<p>The first thing to highlight is that UPI is a real-time payment service, which means that it transfers funds instantly, without the recipient needing to wait for them to clear. This is particularly useful for casino players, who can start playing as soon as the funds leave their account if they wish.</p>
<p>UPI also boasts enhanced security measures. It uses a single-click 2-factor authentication system to verify customers, as well as QR codes for mobile payments. Users don't need to share any sensitive banking info, they use a unique personal ID code instead.</p>
<p>Customers can also expect a wide array of merchant options when using UPI. As mentioned, the service covers many different industries, including transport, leisure, banking, and online casinos, so you could feasibly get through a whole day of activities just by using UPI.</p>
<p>Despite these advantages, we should also point out that UPI is geographically restricted, so you can only use it if you have an Indian bank account. That said, registered users can still use the service outside of India.</p>
<p>Also, while we believe UPI is a mostly-free and trustworthy service, it's difficult to find exact information about fees on its website, or through asking their virtual agent. For this reason, we recommend reading the terms and conditions before registering with UPI, to avoid any unexpected charges.</p>
<p>How to find the best UPI online casinos</p>
<p>If you search for UPI casinos on Casino Guru, you should see an impressive range of options for you to choose from. Unfortunately, not all of them are guaranteed to be top casinos.</p>
<p>This page is here to help you find the best possible casino, according to your tastes. You can make use of our special review and rating system to get a good idea of each casino at a glance. Our filters will help you sort through them, to pinpoint only the sites that you're interested in.</p>
<p>To see the UPI casinos that score highest in the eyes of our expert team of reviewers, choose the 'Recommended' tab. These have earned the highest Safety Index (with the best ones at the top). This is a score based on objective factors, like the number of complaints the casino has received, and how likely it is to pay out big wins.</p>
<p>The following filters will also guide you to your ideal casino:</p>
<p>Newly opened casinos</p>
<p>New casinos tend to be a mixed bag. While they might have some generous welcoming offers as they try to boost their reputation, their fresh nature means they might also have some negative points (which you'll be able to see in our review of them). Select this filter to see the newest UPI casinos.</p>
<p>Game provider</p>
<p>Big iGaming developers like Scientific Games and 1x2 Gaming regularly release new games into the market. You can use this filter to see which UPI casinos have titles from your preferred provider.</p>
<p>Licensing Authority</p>
<p>Casinos regulated by a trusted authority tend to be much better than those that aren't. This filter will allow you to sort them by regulator.</p>
<p>Customer support language</p>
<p>You have a right to play on a site in your mother tongue, of course. Choose your desired language from this list.</p>

<p>How to make a UPI casino deposit</p>
<p>UPI's real-time payment service makes online casino deposits quick and simple. Its QR code technology means you can also make mobile deposits just as easily. Here's how to do them.</p>
<p>Once you're signed up to the UPI casino of your choice, go to its cashier section and choose 'UPI' from the list of deposit methods. Enter the amount you wish to deposit into your casino balance. Input your UPI login to request the payment. You may receive a QR code to scan if paying by mobile, or you might just have to confirm it through your app.</p>
<p>The funds should arrive in your account right away. If it takes longer than, say, an hour, then we advise you to contact UPI or your casino to check on the payment's status.</p>
<p>UPI withdrawals are also possible, but this depends on if the casino in question allows them. If it does, then you should expect the transaction to take longer – maybe two or three days – and it's possible you'll need to pay a withdrawal fee.</p>
<p>UPI casino bonuses</p>
<p>If you're wondering which UPI casinos offer bonuses, then this is the section for you. You'll be able to find deposit bonuses here: these are extra credits or spins that you get after putting money into your casino account. No deposit bonuses, on the other hand, are typically smaller, but you can get these just for signing up.</p>
<p>To see UPI casino bonuses, go to our list of casino bonuses and select 'UPI' on the Payment Method filter there. If you wish, you can then narrow this list down by the type of bonuses. Like with the casino filters, we advise you to start with the bonuses on the 'Recommended' tab, but you can also see them according to:</p>
<p>The latest offers</p>
<p>Exclusive offers (bonuses available only to Casino Guru customers)</p>
<p>Bonus type (i.e. no deposit bonuses)</p>
<p>Bonus value</p>
<p>Several more filters are listed down the page.</p>
