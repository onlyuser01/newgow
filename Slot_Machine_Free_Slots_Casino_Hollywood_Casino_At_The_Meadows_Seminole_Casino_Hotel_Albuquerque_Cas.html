<p>The Washington Commanders’ new quarterback Carson Wentz is playing against his old team, the Philadelphia Eagles, in Week 3. He did very well in the first two games with his new team, even though the Commanders lost one of those two. Meanwhile, the Eagles have a 100% record in the 2022 NFL, with two fantastic performances, especially in the offense.</p>

<p>Philadelphia Eagles Look Unstoppable</p>
<p>The Eagles started the season with a three-point win over the Detroit Lions. They did struggle in that game, even though the oddsmakers thought of them as six-point favorites. Still, as we later learned, the Lions aren’t too bad after all, especially not in the offense. This is why no one should blame the Eagles defense for conceding 35 points in Week 1.</p>
<p>This goes especially because they put on a really amazing performance in Week 2 against the Minnesota Vikings, keeping the opposition offense to only seven points. Meanwhile, their offense did a fabulous job yet again, scoring 24 points.</p>
<p>Philly’s second-year QB Jalen Hurts was superb in that game, throwing 26/31 for 333 yards and one touchdown, along with one interception. He also made 11 carries, gaining 57 yards, and scoring two touchdowns.</p>
<p>Washington Commanders Need to Up Their Game</p>
<p>The Commanders are 1-1 after two weeks of the 2022 NFL season, even though they played against two huge underdogs so far. Their Week 1 opponent was Jacksonville, a team that finished bottom in the AFC last season. Their Week 2 opponent was Detroit, which finished bottom in the NFC last year.</p>
<p>Against the Jaguars, the Commanders won 28-22 at home, while the Lions beat them 36-27 in Detroit. Obviously, with 55 points scored, their Carson Wentz-led offense has been doing an okay job in 2022. Their defense, however, needs to step up.</p>
<p>With 58 points conceded, the Commanders have one of the worst defenses in the NFC. In fact, there are only two teams from the conference that have conceded more points than them.</p>
<p>Eagles vs Commanders Prediction</p>
<p>The Eagles look much stronger than the Commanders right now. Their firepower just cannot be stopped by the Washington defense. Washington’s offense might put on a decent performance, but that probably won’t be enough to bring them another win.</p>
<p>Picks: Philadelphia Eagles to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
