    <h1>Casino Promotions Casa Blanca Hotel Casino All Michigan Online Casinos Casino Free Online Lincoln Ca</h1>

<p>The provider of live and online casino games has brought in a new head of product to help the company’s commitment to growth and further expansion</p>
<p>Adam Lahouiri is a well-seasoned industry veteran who has done stints at other prominent companies from the sector, including Entain, where he is joining from. He comes at a time when BetGames is pushing ahead with an ambitious plan that will see the introduction of plenty of new content and optimization of the existing product lineup.</p>
<p>BetGames Welcomes Adam Lahouiri as the New Head of Product</p>
<p>Lahouiri has played important roles in strengthening companies understanding of their processes, and importantly – products. He has helped deliver live and traditional casino games with a number of prominent brands, particularly within Entain’s ecosystem.</p>
<p>He will now carry over his experience from one industry giant to the next with the new head of product helping steer BetGames’ success story and continued achievements. Company chief product and business development officer Ian Catchick welcomed the appointment of Lahouiri and said that it was an important milestone:</p>
<p>His skills and knowledge will be invaluable to the evolving demands of our goals to create new live and RNG content, both key areas that match the changing needs of our players while taking our existing products and developing them to further cement our status as the industry’s leading tier-one provider of bespoke studio content. Chief product and business development officer Ian Catchick</p>
<p>His joining the team, added Catchick, is a significant opportunity for BetGames to drive long-term and sustainable growth. Lahouiri was himself excited at having this opportunity and added that BetGames was a tier-one supplier that he respected and was excited to work as part of.</p>
<p>Ready to Help BetGames Achieve Significant Milestones</p>
<p>“Having enjoyed a fantastic career in live gaming, I’ve gained a unique insight into the products that make the vertical tick and the players that enjoy them,” he added, saying that he was looking forward to working with the company and its team.</p>
<p>BetGames has been pushing in the meantime to make its content more readily accessible to new players and operators. The company teamed up with PartyCasino to provide the brand with fresh games and signed a distribution agreement with QTech Games.</p>
