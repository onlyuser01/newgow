    <h1>Casino Queen Marquette Marquette Ia Ruby Casino Casino Hotel In Reno The Lodge Casino Roulette Onlin</h1>

<p>hello i hope you are doing well. I am contacting you regarding a complaint against buumi.com casino and the operator Njord Vantage Services LTD. I made a complaint to them because they are not compliant with the estonian gambling law the section ยง 55. Protection of players in remote gambling.</p>
<p>This casino has violated the estonian gambling act and law by not having clear information on for how long a player has been continuously playing which is called a "session timer" and which is a regulatory requirement under the estonian gambling act and law when it comes to responsible gambling. Only thing they have on their casino is just a normal clock that shows my local time but no session timer or clear information for how long the session has lasted continuously displaying. I have checked and all of the other casinos have this session timer who are operating under the estonian license except this one and i asked them to refund the net losses of 5061,58e based on not being compliant with the gambling regulation and law and without the clear information how long a session has lasted under the estonian gambling law this does not count as remote gambling and all bets should be voided and ent losses refunded. i have been playing in a casino that is not safe to play in under the estonian gambling law and they are not compliant with the regulation and law missing one of the most important things they need to have under the player protection in remote gambling section. There is already almost no requirements under the estonian gambling act but they still are missing the little bit they should have under the regulation.</p>
<p>Their response to me was this:</p>

<p>They are stating that they are fully compliant with the estonian gambling act which they are not by missing on of the most important things what comes to responsible gambling under the estonian gambling act, the session timer or clear information to see how long the session has lasted. I have not been aware of how long i have been playing which ofcourse resulted in me losing much more than i could afford and i developed a gambling problem because of it. I thought i was playing somewhere that is safe and properly regulated under the estonian gambling act but this casino is not.</p>
<p>it says the following under the estonian gambling act:</p>
<p>ยง 55. Protection of players in remote gambling</p>
<p>(4) Clear information on for how long a player has been playing shall be continuously displayed to the player, and the player shall be enabled to access the data regarding the bets made and prizes won by him or her.</p>
<p>it also says this:</p>
<p>Gambling is not considered remote gambling where electronic means of communication are used only for receiving bets, information about the outcome of the game or transferring payments to the account of a player.</p>
<p>A server containing the software used for the organisation of remote gambling shall store data regarding the registration, identification and verification of the identity of a player, verification of compliance with the age limit, verification of restrictions on gambling, the start of a gaming session, and logging in.</p>
<p>this casino is not compliant with the estonian regulation and law and thats why i need you're help to get this money refunded since this casino has refused and lied that they are compliant with the regulation when they are not and i have all the proofs attached to this message.</p>
<p>I have checked and other casinos under estonian gambling license have the "session timer" and clear information how long a session has been going on since without it this does not count as remote gambling under the estonian gambling regulation. Proof of this attached also tot his complaint</p>
<p>I have video proof of the casino me logged in and opening games and the session timer or clear information is nowhere to be found on the casino. there is no information anywhere that shows how long you have been logged in or playing, which is clear violation of the estonian gambling law under the protection of players in remote gambling part which i quoted before.</p>
<p>evidence supporting my claims are attached to this message.</p>
