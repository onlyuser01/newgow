<p>Enchanted Eyes review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Ainsworth produced Enchanted Eyes to fill the Egyptian-themed line on the roster that all slot makers have. When matched up against other similarly themed slots, this does very little to earn its place alongside popular slots like Book of Ra.</p>
<p>There is very little done with the theme, just the usual selection of vaguely ancient Egyptian symbols and a very generic background.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Much of the disappointment in this theme comes from the fact that the slot is badly designed. While not as ugly as some of Ainsworth’s output, Enchanted Eyes is rather bland to look at. The background is a night sky (hardly the most Egyptian of settings) and though the symbols are designed perfectly well, they are arranged on beige backgrounds and animated rather crudely.</p>
<p>There is no background music to speak of, which is probably a blessing if the rest of the sound design is anything to go by.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is the 25 win line, five by three slot machine that all Ainsworth slots seem to be built on, just reskinned. It also enjoys the typically difficult to explain (see below) but in practice rather unimaginative selection of bonuses.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is a basic Wild symbol which substitutes for all other symbols except for the Scatter and Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>Hitting three Bonus symbols in the main game triggers one of the preogressive Major, Minor, or Mini Bonus payout. Naturally, these bonuses are weighted heavily towards the lowest ones. Additionally, the number of Bonus symbols is proportional to the size of your bet. So a player risking the maximum £/$/€40.00 per spin will hit the Bonus symbols much more often than someone playing for a lower amount.</p>
<p>Hitting six or more Scatters triggers the Big Hit feature. Paytable payouts are not given out during the Big Hit feature. Instead, you receive three respins during which Free Spins and Random Payouts are earned. After the respins run out these Free Spins play out and the Random Payouts are awarded.</p>
<p>The sequence for the Big Hit is as follows: the three respins are awarded; an amount between one and two times the number of Scatters is added to the Free Spin meter; the Scatter stick in place while the respins play out; if additional Scatters are hit, the respins reset to three; all Scatters are awarded a value between 1 and 50 which is multiplied by your bet per line and added to the Win meter. When there are no respins left, the game ends the Win meter pays out and the Free Spins are triggered.</p>
<p>During Free Spins a new set of payouts are in place. In particular, the Princess Bonus symbol is added to the middle three reels. Hitting four or five of these will win the Mini bonus, six or seven the Minor, and eight or nine the Major bonus.</p>
<p>There is also the Extra Bonus which is triggered randomly in the main game and consists of the Big Hit Feature with the middle three reels covered with a three-by-three Scatter that counts towards any totals.</p>
<p>If the player hits 15 Scatters during the Big Hit or Extra Bonus features, the player wins the Grand bonus.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The abysmally low return to player on this game 94.31% is much too low for a recommendation, especially when coupled with Enchanted Eyes medium volatility. We aim to only recommend higher volatility slots unless there are mitigating factors. This is because higher volatility slots pair better with our favoured strategies.</p>
<p>The site we tested offered a bet size ranging from a minimum bet per spin of £/$/€0.50 to a maximum bet per spin of £/$/€40.00. Like many Ainsworth games this bet range is rather low, but your mileage may vary on other sites.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Despite its complex bonus system, Enchanted eyes is a dull game in terms of its actual gameplay. Coupled with weak design, ugly visuals and a much to high vig.</p>
<p>There is very little to recommend such a slot.</p>
