<p>After entering Colombia as an Official Sports Betting partner to the Spanish football topflight tournament LaLiga, RushBet is now doubling down on its commitment to continue growing across the Latin American region. Rush Street Interactive, the company that operates the RushBet brand as its online and physical sportsbook asset, has confirmed that RushBet will now look beyond Colombia in order to leverage its brand identity and presence in the region better.</p>
<p>RushBet has been serious about entering the Latin American market as well. The company launched in Mexico on June 30, 2022, seeking to expand its clout in the region. RSI introduced its country-facing brand and website RushBet.mx on both mobile and desktop. At the time, RSI CEO Richard Schwartz said that the company was pleased to build upon the track record of success in the Latin American region.</p>
<p>LaLiga got underway over the weekend with the European soccer competitions returning in full strength and offering RushBet an opportunity to leverage its partnership with the event in order to strike home with new and existing audiences both. RushBet will expand on its existing partnership with the organization and will have access to its intellectual property rights and individual divisions, to name Santander and Smartbank.</p>
<p>RushBet will further leverage the partnerships by gaining access to various LaLiga-branded merchandise, player jerseys, and more, which can then be sold at sports bars, the company said. There will be work on a number of "Money Can’t Buy Experiences," which will focus on extending a number of amenities to fans who are lucky enough to win.</p>
<p>Among the prizes that people stand to win are tickets to highly-anticipated games in LaLiga, VIP events, and meet-and-greet opportunities with popular sports personalities from the competition. RushBet will also seek to work closely with LaLiga ambassadors, spreading its brand and message in Latin America and beyond.</p>
<p>The company is fully committed to increasing its presence in the region in countries besides Colombia, it confirmed. RSI Colombia General Manager Valentin Birnstein welcomed the opportunity to work with LaLiga and bring unique experiences to customers.</p>
<p>Birnstein stressed that the company is solely interested in providing RushBet customers with "top-tier content and high-quality entertainment." The present expansion of the existing ties between the organization was a step in this direction, Birnstein assured.</p>
<p>LaLiga Executive Director Oscar Mayor was similarly pleased with the development. He argued that the organization was thrilled to share the adrenaline and passion for the competition and game with RushBet’s customers in Colombia and the other countries where the company wishes to operate.</p>
