<p>The supplier is continuing to build upon its success achieved through the recent launches in the Netherlands and Estonia</p>
<p>Gaming Corps is now expanding with the prominent online casino operator, Play North, which will enable the company to offer its content to a number of new brands. Play North is operating successful iGaming websites, including Kansino, Pikakasino and Kiirkasiino, all of which will now benefit from the fresh content offered by Gaming Corps.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps Set to Bring More Joy to Play North Players</p>
<p>Gaming Corps will moving forward feature an extensive selection of its unique games, such as Plinko, Crash, Mine, table, and slot titles. These games include popular releases including Jet Lucky 2 &amp; Raging Zeus Mines. Coin Miner and Penalty Champion are also part of the supplier’s extensive list of excellent releases.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has been demonstrating its ability to strike home with a vast array of audiences who are interested in the innovative features and game plots by the Swedish developer. Gaming Corps CCO Danielle Calafato has welcomed the opportunity to see Play North become the latest operator partner for the supplier:</p>
<p>Play North is a perfect fit for us, having carved out a reputation as one of the most recognizable online casino operators in both the Netherlands and Estonia; two markets in which we are growing both in terms of revenue, recognition and visibility. Gaming Corps CCO Danielle Calafato</p>
<p>Calafato added that his company was capable of producing and delivering outstanding iGaming products that were now bound to bring further success to Play North and its distinguished brands. Play North Director of Product &amp; CX Daphne Xerri was similarly excited about the opportunity.</p>
<p>Xerri hailed Gaming Corps’ established track record in delivering innovative game variants such as Crash and Mine, as well as Plinko, and said that the supplier brought plenty that the players at Play North brands would enjoy. “I look forward to what should be a very successful partnership,” Xerri concluded.</p>
<p>Gaming Crops has been scaling its offer rapidly over the past months. Apart from teaming up with Play North, the company recently introduced its inaugural slot-slash-mine game that combines mechanics from both genres. Prior to this, the Swedish supplier announced a similar content partnership with Vera &amp; John.</p>
<p>Overall, Gaming Corps continues to make its presence in the iGaming space known and it has been expanding rapidly across new markets. The latest Play North tie-up is a step forward for the company’s overall content strategy.</p>
