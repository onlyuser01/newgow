<p>Tom Horn Gaming Teams up With Casino Solverde in Portugal</p>
<p>Tom Horn Gaming has expanded its footprint in Europe yet again with a newly-minted partnership with Casino Solverde, a Portuguese iGaming operator. Under the partnership, Solverde will list Tom Horn Gaming products, including the company’s iGaming software suite and slot titles, and specifically games such as Diamond Hill and 243 Crystal Fruits.</p>
<p>Tom Horn has a portfolio of upcoming and established games to offer and all will be available to Casino Solverde’s consumer base. On October 28, the brand will release Wolf Sierra to complete an already impressive portfolio of slots, including Spinball, Kongo Bongo, Frozen Queen, and others.</p>
<p>The supplier also specializes in other products, such as table games and video poker to name a handful. Tom Horn has already had successful partnership with Portuguese casino brands, marking both the supplier’s interest in strengthening its ties in the country as well as Portugal’s liberal and developing iGaming sector.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Solverde Group director Américo Loureiro had this to say: “With the addition of Tom Horn slots we bolster our online casino offering further, getting near the 1000 games milestone.”</p>
<p>Loureiro attested to Tom Horn Gaming’s ability to create engaging content and bring top-shelf products to Solverde’s portfolio, including Diamond Hill and Joker Reelz. Furthermore, Loureiro considers Tom Horn to be “an essential provider” to feature in the casino’s portfolio, helping the website diversify and enrich its slot offering.</p>
<p>Tom Horn has been adding a number of new partners all over in Europe recently, including LottoGo, Annexio, and Videoslots. Tom Horn Gaming CEO Ondrej Lapides was excited to be a part of the partnership with Casino Solverde.pt, arguing that it has helped the company expand its portfolio to new audiences.</p>
<p>Growth has been significant over the past several years, Lapides noted, and Tom Horn has entered new markets and regulated markets as a result. “Now is the time to capitalize on our reach and solidify our presence with strong and reliable partnerships. Solverde is definitely one of them,” concluded.</p>
<p>Tom Horn was given a regulatory approval to join Portugal back in 2019 and introduced its online casino software. In October last year, Tom Horn signed a partnership with Casino Portugal.</p>
