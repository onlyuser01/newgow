<p>Joker 81 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Joker 81 carves out a classic, one-armed bandit, fruit machine style for itself. Its reels are adorned with the classic cherries, sevens, bars and watermelons of old style machines and a fruit salad of semi-new additions like plums and oranges.</p>
<p>The theme of old style no-fuss no-muss machines is also reflected in the creator’s choices for the gameplay. The 81 in the title refers to one of the simple bonus features (details below).</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are no fancier than they need to be. The background is dark with an abstract orange pattern, just enough for it not to feel like the field was left blank by the creators, but not enough to distract.</p>
<p>The symbols are well designed having that instant recognition that cartoony icons have, while not being too minimalist.</p>
<p>The sound design is almost non-existent. Just a simple clicking for the reels and bell sounds to indicate when the 81-line feature is triggered.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Joker 81 is a four-reel slot machine with seven winlines and only one set of payouts. You have to hit four symbols on a pay line in order to win the prize.</p>
<p>There is a small variation on the standard gameplay described above. When the Bar (which also plays as a Wild) symbol falls on a reel it triggers the 81 winline feature. This adds 74 more lines to the reels for a total of 81 win lines.</p>
<p>You can get some nice winnings when you hit fully stacked reels of the same symbol</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The only special feature for this slot is the 81 winline feature triggered by the Wild symbol. As well as triggering this feature the Wild symbol plays as any symbol and pays out 120 times your bet per spin if you hit four in a row on a winline.</p>
<p>If you like your games without too many frills and accessories this may well appeal to you.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Kajot Games do not provide an RTP for this game which is a concerning sign. While the industry average seems to be around 96% we can normally assume machines with a high return to player will make the effort to advertise this fact.</p>
<p>Since you have to hit four symbols to win a payout winnings come very rarely and tend to be pretty small unless you manage to hit a couple of stacked symbols with the Joker symbol. As a result, this game has a relatively high variance.</p>
<p>The range of bets available on the site we tested was €/£/$0.10 up to €/£/$100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Some nice big wins can be attained in Joker 81 slot machine even without info about its RTP</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Joker 81 is a nicely made, simple slot machine that evokes the simpler era of pull lever spin the reels type gameplay.</p>
<p>Even though we like its high variance, it is hard to recommend a slot that is so cagey with its other key statistic: its RTP.</p>
