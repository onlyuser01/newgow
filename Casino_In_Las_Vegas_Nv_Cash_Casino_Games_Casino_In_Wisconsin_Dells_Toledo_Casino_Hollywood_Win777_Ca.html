<p>Online casino and sports betting operator Rush Street Interactive (RSI) announced today its online gaming platform will feature in Mexico via an exclusive partnership with media conglomerate Grupo Multimedios.</p>
<p>Expanding Colombian Presence</p>
<p>The 25-year agreement between RSI and Grupo Multimedios will allow RSI, in close partnership with one of the media conglomerate’s subsidiaries, to operate online gaming and sports betting in Mexico and further expand its Latin American presence. RSI has a strong presence in the region via its RushBet Colombian brand.</p>
<p>Commenting on the exclusive partnership, RSI chief executive officer Richard Schwartz outlined the agreement with “one of the most respected media enterprises in Mexico” would “serve as a great accelerant” for building RSI’s online gaming operations in a country with a population of more than 130 million that, on top of Colombia’s 50 million, would significantly expand the company’s offering in the region.</p>
<p>He also noted the great impression left by Grupo Multimedios’ management team and long track record of success in building and growing digital businesses in the country, something that could be invaluable to RSI as it seeks to grow operations in Mexico and the region.</p>
<p>“As the first U.S. gaming company to launch a regulated online gaming sportsbook in Latin America, we have a deep understanding and appreciation for the communities where we operate and the localization that is needed to thrive in the Latin American market.” Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>The long-term partnership will also provide RSI with the vast array of Grupo Multimedios’ media assets and distribution channels and once the launch of operations that is slated for the second quarter of 2022 happens, RSI will be able to leverage these assets for promotional and content integration purposes.</p>
<p>‘New Partnered Vision’ of Growth and Entrepreneurship</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, co-chief executive officer of Grupo Multimedios Angel Cong outlined the excitement to partner with RSI and leverage the brand’s experience to help the group achieve “a new partnered vision of continuous growth and entrepreneurship.”</p>
<p>“RSI has been successful in the American and Colombian online casino and sportsbook markets; we have no doubt that together we will achieve the same in Mexico. With this partnership, both RSI and Multimedios will take advantage of our media assets to be a strong and successful competitor.” Angel Cong, Co-CEO, Grupo Multimedios</p>
<p>With a history dating back 89 years and spanning across multiple industries such as media, sports, entertainment, wines, food, retail and real estate, Grupo Multimedios’ portfolio of assets include television, radio, print, billboards, digital, as well as digital sports property Mediotiempo with more than seven million unique users every month, leading digital national news and information Milenio with over 27 million users monthly and the network comprising of 22 television and 63 stations, Canal 6.</p>
<p>“We look forward to leveraging the infrastructure, operations team, and relationships developed during our five years of business in Latin America as we expand our best-in-class online gaming platform to a growing Mexico market. We are thrilled to build on our existing success in Latin America and will continue to expand our presence in the region and globally,” added Schwartz.</p>
