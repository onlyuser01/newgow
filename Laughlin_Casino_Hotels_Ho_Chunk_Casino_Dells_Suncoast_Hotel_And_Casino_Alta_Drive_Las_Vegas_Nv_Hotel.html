<p>Some 383 flights were delayed and 41 were canceled at Harry Reid International Airport Saturday. That’s because of stormy weather that also flooded Las Vegas roads, according to FlightAware.</p>

<p>Additional flights were delayed or canceled on Friday by nasty conditions, the flight tracking service revealed.</p>
<p>Storms drenching the Las Vegas Valley on Friday and Saturday also led to one person’s death, many power outages, and flooding.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Las Vegas Fire and Rescue crews found a lifeless body near Rainbow Boulevard. It appears the unnamed victim drowned during the storm on Friday night. The body got swept away in currents before coming to rest among debris, according to Las Vegas TV station KLAS.</p>
<p>During the height of the storm, there were about a dozen rescues of pedestrians by Las Vegas firefighters after the civilians got stranded in waterways. Between 30 and 35 vehicles also got stranded in the water during the storms.</p>
<p>Also, some 4,000 Las Vegas Valley residents and businesses lost electricity.</p>
<p>Major thoroughfares got flooded during the heavy rains as well. These include such intersections as Las Vegas Boulevard and Cheyenne Avenue, as well as Blue Diamond Road and Rainbow Boulevard, Las Vegas TV station KTNV reported.</p>
<p>Cheyene Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard reportedly saw more than 1.5 inches of rain on Friday night. Flooded roads were expected to begin to dry out on Sunday, Fox Weather predicted.</p>
<p>Linq Hotel</p>
<p>Social media posters also informed the public about flooded conditions. Waters were shown flowing from beneath the Linq Hotel + Experience on the Las Vegas Strip, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported.</p>

<p>But Andrew Trelease, assistant general manager for the Clark County Regional Flood Control District, said the infrastructure designed to prevent flooding largely works efficiently.</p>
<p>For the most part, we do a great job, and we’re very low profile except for, in some of those areas, like behind the Linq, it is very high profile because everyone just thinks that something is wrong when it’s really not,” Trelease told the Insider.</p>
<p>Allegiant Stadium Leak</p>
<p>In addition, Allegiant Stadium began to leak during a Saturday football game between the Bryant Bulldogs and UNLV Rebels, Fox Weather reported.</p>

<p>Also, Clark County Public Works Department crews fixed a sinkhole Friday near the intersection of Jones Boulevard and Harmon Avenue. It was described as being eight-feet wide and 10-feet deep, KLAS reported.</p>
<p>Numerous Clark County roads were closed on Saturday by flooding and damage, including:</p>
<p>I-15 southbound near the California-Nevada border</p>
<p>Gilespie Street and Maulding Avenue, east of Las Vegas Boulevard</p>
<p>Jones Boulevard and Pyle Avenue</p>
<p>Rand Road in Moapa</p>
<p>Jones and Gunderson Avenue</p>
<p>Alexander Road and Puebla Street</p>
<p>West Calico Basin Road</p>
<p>State Route 169 in Overton</p>
<p>And State Route 612/Nellis Boulevard at Flamingo Road.</p>
<p>Parks were closed too, including:</p>
<p>Mayfair Park, Field 7 at Kellog Zaher Sports Complex, and Barkin’ Basin Park.</p>
<p>At the Burning Man festival, taking place at Black Rock Desert, Nevada, tens of thousands of attendees were stranded following storms there, the Associated Press reported. One person died and the cause is under investigation.</p>
