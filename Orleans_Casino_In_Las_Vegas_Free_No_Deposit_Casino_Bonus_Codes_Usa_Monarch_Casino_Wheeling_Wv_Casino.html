    <h1>Orleans Casino In Las Vegas Free No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes Usa Monarch Casino Wheeling Wv Casino</h1>

<p>So here I am thinking Shazam Casino is pretty cool. Got my no deposit bonus and I wagered it but only max$100. No biggie it’s an extra $100 I can’t complain, that is until the nightmare began. So as a new player you gotta go thru the whole verify process which is supposed to be fast. Well 7 days later I’m finally verified to withdrawl but they say you must deposit first and wager that one time. So that’s done and I submit my withdrawl and I have to wait now for the finance department to approve it. 7 days later it finally gets approved and I’m under the impression that I would get my money that night or latest the next day! Well so I started the verification process on 2/23/23 and it’s now 4/1/23 so for a measly $125 I’ve been waiting 40 days emailing nobody so it would seem because they don’t reply back but if they do they say that they wired it to my account already, so I show them proof that there lying and that there was only the money that they took from my deposit. Then I gave them my Bitcoin wallet address telling them to just deposit it there. This place is a freaking joke then on top of it, it would seem like there liars as well. So if your thinking about trying this place out "DONT DO IT", even if I do eventually get paid it won’t change my mind at tall. How the hell you going to run a casino but have issues paying out so little. There liars , and a bunch of cheap ass scam artists. So RUN brother RUN and you can thank me later</p>
