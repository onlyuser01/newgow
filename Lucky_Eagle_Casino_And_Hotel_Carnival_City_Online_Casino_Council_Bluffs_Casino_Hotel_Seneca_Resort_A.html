<p>Gambling operators are actively seeking to strengthen their commitment to responsible gambling with BetCity.nl making another step in this direction</p>
<p>To this end, the prominent Dutch sports betting and gaming operator has teamed up with Mindway AI, a provider of responsible gambling solutions that help protect customers. Thanks to this tie-up, Mindway AI will provide BetCity with the tools necessary to enhance player protection and promote responsible gambling practices.</p>
<p>BetCity Doubles Down on Tackling Problem Gambling</p>
<p>The Entain Group operator is confident that Mindway AI’s cutting-edge technology and expertise are precisely what it takes to strengthen its presence in the sector and provide customers with the level of protection they deserve. Mindway AI has a deep understanding of artificial intelligence and leverages neuroscientific insights to ensure that its partners can deliver more secure gambling experiences.</p>
<p>Presently, the product is licensed and implemented in 47 jurisdictions and it covers more than 7 million active users globally. One of the tools that BetCity will leverage is the company’s Mindway AI’s GameScanner which leverages advanced AI to help brands spot early signs of problem gambling and behavioral aberrations.</p>
<p>Mindway AI CEO Rasmus Kjaergaard welcomed the opportunity to sign up a partnership with BetCity.nl and bring its advanced solutions to the company, serving it with a powerful range of tools that will minimize risks associated with gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>Protecting Consumers Needs the Right Expertise</p>
<p>BetCity Head of Responsible Gaming Development &amp; Research Iris den Boer was similarly pleased to see this partnership take shape and said:</p>
<p>We are excited to partner with Mindway AI as one of the leading operators in the Netherlands. Together with the expertise of Mindway and its innovative product, we are convinced we can take the next step in Responsible Gaming.</p>
<p>The partnership between the two brands will help both of them to strengthen their presence in the Dutch online gaming market and bring valuable and active insights. Mindway AI combines human expertise with automated and powerful algorithms to tackle serious issues such as problem gambling and gambling harm.</p>
<p>Mindway AI’s solutions make it much easier for companies to intervene in the early stages and avoid more serious complications. Earlier this year, Mindway AI and AnonyMind teamed up to tackle gambling addiction by leveraging their respective tools and technical expertise.</p>
