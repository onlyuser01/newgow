    <h1>Turtle Creek Casino Hotel Bitstarz Casino Login Hollywood Casino Wv Empire City Casino Lucky Lil S C</h1>

<p>Two guests who stayed at The Orleans Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, in December 2022 and January 2023 have contracted Legionnaires’ disease, according to the Southern Nevada Health District</p>
<p>The health authorities are investigating the cases and have asked the hotel to assist with the inquiry.</p>
<p>Legionnaires’ Disease Caused by Contaminated Water Droplets</p>
<p>The Orleans Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, is collaborating with the Health District by notifying all guests who have stayed at the hotel since December 16, 2022, both past and present. Guests who stayed during this time and experienced symptoms up to 14 days after their stay can report their illness to the Health District.</p>
<p>After Legionella bacteria were detected in the water system at The Orleans Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, the hotel has taken swift action by implementing remediation procedures and a proactive water management plan. The remediation process involves disinfection efforts to remove harmful bacteria and ensure the safety of guests who use the hotel’s water facilities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Health District is closely monitoring the hotel’s water system throughout the process to ensure that the disinfection efforts are effective in eliminating any traces of the Legionella bacteria. By taking such measures, the hotel aims to minimize the risk of further contamination and prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>What is Legionnaires’ Disease?</p>
<p>Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia caused by inhaling aerosol droplets of water contaminated with the bacteria, which, however, does not spread from person to person. Sources of aerosol can include showers, hot tubs, faucets, cooling towers, misters, and decorative fountains. While most healthy people exposed to Legionella do not get sick, the disease can be severe and sometimes fatal.</p>
<p>Symptoms typically appear within two to 10 days after exposure, but guests should watch for symptoms for about two weeks after. Those who stayed at The Orleans Hotel &amp; Casino more than two weeks ago and have not developed symptoms are not at risk. If guests develop symptoms within 14 days of their stay, they should seek medical attention immediately and inform their healthcare provider of their potential exposure to Legionella. Symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches, and headaches, and the disease is treated with antibiotics.</p>
<p>Factors that can increase the risk of getting sick include being age 50 or older, being a current or former smoker, having a chronic lung disease (like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema), having a suppressed immune system or taking drugs that suppress the immune system, having cancer, diabetes, or kidney failure, or having other underlying illnesses.</p>
