<p>Australia-based sportsbook PointsBet and the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) have announced their partnership for a new initiative. The joint research will examine how online gambling providers deal with problem gambling. More than 700 government, industry, and clinical stakeholders will face simulated situations where they find the best way to deal with a client exhibiting gambling addiction signs. The results of the initiative will be announced in September 2022.</p>
<p>The NCPG Is Firmly on the Clients’ Side</p>
<p>According to Keith Whyte, Executive Director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, stakeholders should have full access to the responsible gambling tools provided by operators. He noted that the increased transparency would ensure that the existing measures are sufficient and offer adequate customer protection.</p>
<p>Our hope is that the results of this survey will spark dialogue… and… help inform the responsible gambling decisions that online gambling operators face. Keith Whyte, NCPG Executive Director</p>
<p>Whyte added that the initiative was not aimed solely at operators. In his words, regulators, researchers, treatment providers, and problem gaming advocates shared responsibility toward players.</p>
<p>PointsBet Was Glad to Offer Assistance</p>
<p>Johnny Aitken, PointsBet USA CEO, shared the NCPG’s sentiment. He addressed the growing concerns that the rapid expansion of regulated sports betting across the country was outpacing player protection efforts.</p>
<p>A commitment to responsible gambling today will have a direct impact on the future health of players and sustainability of the industry. Johnny Aitken, CEO of PointsBet USA</p>
<p>Aitken stressed the importance of the new research project and stated that PointsBet and the NCPG were aiming to find better solutions to help people with gambling addiction. The extra insights would also assist operators in implementing player protection policies.</p>
<p>The New Program Launches with a Joint Survey</p>
<p>The NCPG is the only national US nonprofit organization dedicated to minimizing the harm of gambling addiction. With the backing of a high-profile operator like PointsBet, it is in the perfect position to increase awareness of problem gaming and mitigate its negative impact on society.</p>
<p>PointsBet and the NCPG will cooperate with the Massachusetts Council on Gaming during the National Conference on Gambling Addiction and Responsible Gambling 2022. The event will run for four days starting July 20 under the motto Better Together: Advocacy, Awareness &amp; Assistance. It aims to unite gambling industry representatives, government officials, researchers, and healthcare specialists. The program includes lectures and studies from eminent national and international experts regarding the impact of problem gambling on various social groups.</p>
<p>PointsBet and the NCPG will use the event to conduct their joint survey. Attendees will be asked to assume the role of a gambling operator and deal with three fictional clients demonstrating potentially problematic gaming behavior. They will then have to decide on appropriate measures for each case.</p>
