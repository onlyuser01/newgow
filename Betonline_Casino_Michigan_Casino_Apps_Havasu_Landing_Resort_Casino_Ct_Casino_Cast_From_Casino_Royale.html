    <h1>Betonline Casino Michigan Casino Apps Havasu Landing Resort Casino Ct Casino Cast From Casino Royale</h1>

<p>Dear Sarah,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the casino’s T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>„9.1 Each player can create only one (1) personal account.</p>
<p>9.2 Creating multiple Player Accounts by the same player can lead to termination of all such accounts and confiscation of all funds on the balances. The player shall not provide access to his or her Player Account or allow any third party, including, but not limited to minors, to use the Website.</p>
<p>9.3 Any returns, winnings or bonuses which a player has gained or accrued during such time as the Duplicate Account was active may be reclaimed by us, and players undertake to return any such funds which have been withdrawn from the Duplicate Account to us on demand.</p>
<p>9.4 The Website can only be used for personal purposes and shall not be used for any type of commercial profit.</p>
<p>9.5 Only one account in Fastpay casino can be opened per one person, one IP address, one physical address, one device, one payment wallet or bank card owner. The violation of this rule will lead to the blocking of the account and confiscation of active balance."</p>
<p>Did your friend use your device to play at this casino? If yes, did he play with his own account? Please understand, that you should never let anyone else access your casino account, or play from your device, as both situations are against T&amp;Cs in most casinos.</p>
<p>Please forward any relevant communication between you and the casino to kristina.s@casino.guru (or you can post it here).</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
