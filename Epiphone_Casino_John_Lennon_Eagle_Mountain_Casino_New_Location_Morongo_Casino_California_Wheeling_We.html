<p>The devastating cyberattack against the company last month temporarily impacted its hotel bookings along with other amenities</p>
<p>The leading gaming, hospitality and entertainment giant, MGM Resorts International, became a victim of a cyberattack back in September. At the time, the operator confirmed issues with bookings, hotel electronic doors, some slot machines, as well as other amenities. After the initial attack, MGM was able to recover and resume its operations while at the same time rejecting the option to pay ransom.</p>
<p>The cyberattack impacted MGM’s performance, resulting in a dip in its shares. Currently, the company’s stock trades in the $36 range. However, one analyst predicted a rebound and remained optimistic about MGM’s future performance, despite the devastating attack. As announced by CDC Gaming Reports, Carlo Santarelli, an analyst for Deutsche Bank, remains optimistic about MGM, explaining that the cyberattack only briefly impacted the company’s performance.</p>
<p>Speaking about the current stock, the analyst said it is “very cheap.” Yet, Deutsche Bank’s assessment of MGM’s target price stock remains high, decreasing slightly from $57 to $56. This assessment comes ahead of the release of the operator’s third quarter results which are expected on November 8, 2023, and takes into consideration the recent cyberattack.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, MGM confirmed it expects the impact of the cybersecurity issue to be reflected in its Q3 2023 earnings. At the time, the company estimated a reduction of approximately $100 million in adjusted EBITDAR for September. With that in mind, Santarelli explained: “The impact from one-time expenses related to the breach is expected to be less than $10 million in the third quarter, and we do not believe these expenses will be reflected in adjusted EBITDAR, as they are expected to be covered by insurance.”</p>
<p>Impact of Cyberattack Evident in September’s Results</p>
<p>The analyst spoke about the impact of the cyberattack on the third quarter results. Still, Santarelli said that the results in September were primarily impacted by the cyberattack but figures from July and August remained “essentially flat.”</p>
<p>While MGM’s performance was impacted last month with occupancy decreasing to 88%, lower than the 93% recorded for the corresponding period in 2022, performance this month is expected to be nearly on par. MGM is expected to report occupancy for October of 93%, slightly below the October 2022 result of 94%.</p>
<p>“The deceleration in the third quarter, however, was largely a result of September performance and we believe primarily relates to the cyber-security incident, as well as the reporting of GGR related to the incident.“ Carlo Santarelli, analyst for Deutsche Bank</p>
<p>Recently, another analyst predicted that MGM will quickly recover from the cyberattack. David Katz, an equity analyst predicted that the company’s stock is likely to rebound in the near future, hitting $69. Moreover, he explained that the cybersecurity issue isn’t likely to impact the business in the long term.</p>
