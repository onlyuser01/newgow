<p>Chelsea welcome Leeds United at Stamford Bridge this Saturday in an attempt to end their disastrous run</p>
<p>Chelsea recorded only two wins in all competitions in the last 100 days. The Blues are without a single win in their last six games, with three straight losses. Is it time for their bad run to end? It sure seems like that because, on Saturday, March 4, they’re playing a home game against relegation candidate Leeds United.</p>

<p>It’s High Time for Chelsea to Start Winning</p>
<p>Saturday’s game looks like a perfect storm for Chelsea. Everything seems to be going in their favor right now so they can finally win a game. It’s been a long time since they last did it – more than a month and a half ago they defeated Crystal Palace 1-0 at home.</p>
<p>Since that win, they’re 0-3-2 in the Premier League and 0-1 in the Champions League. The worst thing is that since the Crystal Palace game, they’ve scored only one goal. That really is strange considering how money this team’s invested in signings, focusing mostly on forwards.</p>
<p>Their new signings haven’t been impressive since coming to London, but they’re bound to explode at some point. Can it happen on Saturday? Perhaps, because Chelsea’s coach Graham Potter really needs them to show up. Otherwise, he could lose his job.</p>
<p>Not only do the Blues have the manpower and the motivation needed to beat Leeds, but they will also have their fans to cheer them on. The game is played at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea have all wins against Leeds in their last five meetings. Their most recent duel in London saw the hosts win 3-2.</p>
<p>Relegation Worries Hovering Above Leeds United</p>
<p>Leeds United are currently above the relegation zone. However, they’re just one spot above with only one point more than the two teams below. Their form is far from great, but their new coach Javier Gracia did record a win on his debut.</p>
<p>With the Spaniard in charge, Leeds United were able to beat the bottom-placed Southampton 1-0 at home. This weekend, however, they’re tasked with a much tougher challenge. They need to do well against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, which is where they haven’t won any points for more than two decades.</p>
<p>As if all that wasn’t enough, Leeds also have some injuries to worry about. Their scoring leader Rodrigo is out, the same as his fellow attacker Luis Sinisterra. They’re also without midfielder Adam Forshaw and defender Pascal Struijk.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs Leeds United Prediction</p>
<p>The time has come for Chelsea to win a game finally. The Blues are a much better team than Leeds and they play at home on Saturday. Knowing this, anything but a relatively easy home win would be a major upset.</p>
<p>Pick: Chelsea to win</p>
