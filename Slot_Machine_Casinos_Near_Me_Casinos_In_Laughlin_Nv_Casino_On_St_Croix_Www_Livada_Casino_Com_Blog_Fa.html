    <h1>Slot Machine Casinos Near Me Casinos In Laughlin Nv Casino On St Croix Www Livada Casino Com Blog Fa</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>first of all thank you very much for your answer.</p>
<p>I still think it's a pity that you say that I have expressed my gambling addiction to you, but then again say 'there were no irregularities'</p>
<p>And you took action 'immediately'? That must be a bad joke.</p>
<p>From 07/28/2023 I have been telling you several times a day that I want to limit my account, that I need help, that I have a gambling addiction, that I will only lose my balance, etc. I even wrote to you to just my account close and pay out my balance after the KYC process.</p>
<p>And what came from you? Absolutely no reaction.</p>
<p>I reached out to live chat, wrote to the kyc team, wrote to the support email, multiple times! during the day.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no reaction. Only when I lost my entire balance, deposited another €1010, lost the money too and opened a complaint that I wanted my money back.</p>
<p>So you ignored my gambling addiction for 6 days from 07/28/2023 to 08/02/2023! They waited so long for all my money to be gone!</p>
<p>So please don't tell me they took immediate action. Especially after the frequency of my contact attempts and the use of all possible means known to me.</p>
<p>They even told me they can't close or limit my account as I still have funds. I couldn't pay this out because of the missing KYC process, so what does a gambling addict do? Right, lose everything.</p>
<p>However, they deliberately took advantage of my gambling addiction and are so bold as to write here that they acted immediately.</p>
<p>I lost 4810€ from the time of my first request and I only ask you for the difference of all my deposits for a payout. Or rather my deposits, because I was denied withdrawals.</p>
<p>So I appeal to your common sense to comply without further ado and hope for the support of CasinoGuru. Everything is verifiable and documented.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
