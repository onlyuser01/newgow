<p>Real Luck Group, the company operating the Luckbox esports betting brand, announced today a new addition to its management team as Nevzat Ucar was given the role of Head of Content.</p>
<p>“Content marketing is a key pillar of our player acquisition and brand strategy as we target growth for Luckbox and Nevzat will play an integral role in that.” Quentin Martin, CEO, Real Luck Group</p>
<p>Global Content and Marketing Strategy Responsibilities</p>
<p>The newly-appointed head of content Ucar has been assigned responsibilities with regards to the company’s global content strategy and is expected to play a leading role in Luckbox’s marketing strategy.</p>
<p>“I am a lifelong gamer, and Luckbox’s business targeting the most potentially lucrative esports sector is a compelling opportunity for me. This is a global opportunity to shape our esports community, content and strategy and have fun while doing all of it.” Nevzat Ucar, Head of Content, Real Luck Group</p>
<p>Nevzat Ucar’s most recent previous position was as head of content at Red Bull, and his resume also contains spells at Riot Games as head of video and broadcast, as well as an art director at Fox International Channels.</p>
<p>“Having someone of Nevzat’s pedigree on board strengthens our marketing team and, importantly, his passion for gaming and esports fits in perfectly with our company ethos.” Quentin Martin, CEO, Real Luck Group</p>
<p>Series of High-Profile Appointments</p>
<p>The appointment of Nevzat Ucar as Luckbox’s new head of content is the latest high-profile addition to the esports betting brand. In January, Luckbox announced it hired former member of the financial management team at drone safety solutions developer ParaZero Ltd Ran Kaspi, who also has experience in the gaming industry at 888, as its new chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Luckbox continued with its management team overhaul and announced the appointment of former Dunder and Mr Green veteran and Electronic Arts c-level executive Thomas Rosander as its new chief customer officer.</p>
<p>In-between both appointments, Luckbox moved to expand its existing partnership deal with EveryMatrix to add a selected range of live sports and boost its product offering to 85,000 pre-match events and 70,000 live events per month.</p>
<p>The partnership which began back in 2019 after Luckbox launched sports betting utilizing EveryMatrix’s OddsMatrix sportsbook platform, has proved to be successful ever since and has largely contributed to the popularity of betting on esports.</p>
