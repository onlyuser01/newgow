<p>Aristocrat Gaming is proud to take part in Macau’s first official gaming tradeshow since the lockdown</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming, a leading slot machine and casino game manufacturer, is set to showcase new games at the Macau Gaming Show (MGS) Summit. The event is scheduled for November 14 and 15 and will welcome over 5,000 industry professionals.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated trade exhibition will see Aristocrat Gaming display some of its recent and upcoming titles. Celebrating the Year of the Dragon, the manufacturer will showcase a variety of games designed to suit the needs of Asian players.</p>
<p>Some of the games that will appear at the event include the recently released Jin Cai Hao Yun, Tian Ci Jin Lu and Dragon Link “Spring Festival” games. The latest addition to Aristocrat Gaming’s 5 Dragons portfolio, 5 Dragons Ultra, will also be showcased at the event.</p>
<p>Jin Cai Hao Yun, for example, combines a number of engagement features, such as Reel Growth, Hold &amp; Spin and Repeat Win, providing fans with a charged experience. Dragon Link “Spring Festival”, on the other hand, is the fifth entry in the Dragon Link franchise and builds on the existing popularity and configurability of the link series. 5 Dragons Ultra, on the other hand, features varying volatility, multi-window features and a two-level SAP jackpot.</p>
<p>In addition to familiar games, the gambling manufacturer will demonstrate its new dragon-themed mystery link, Dragon Universe.</p>
<p>MGS Returns to Macau</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming’s general manager for the Asia Pacific region, Lloyd Robson, commented on his team’s upcoming presentation at MGS Summit. He called the Year of the Dragon “the most auspicious year in the Chinese Zodiac” and said that his team is preparing to deliver an exciting line-up of games to celebrate it.</p>
<p>Robson added that his team is delighted by the opportunity to take part in Macau’s first official gaming tradeshow since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>We’re proud to participate in Macau’s first official gaming tradeshow since 2019, demonstrating our continued focus on the market. Our entire regional leadership team will be there to celebrate Macau’s resilience and buoyancy, and we can’t wait to catch up with our customers. Lloyd Robson, GM APAC, Aristocrat Gaming</p>
<p>Speaking of Macau, the special administrative region experienced some devastating setbacks during the height of the pandemic. Luckily, the region’s gaming industry, which had been further affected by the crackdown on junket operators, is now steadily recovering.</p>
