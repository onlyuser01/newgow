    <h1>Red Wing Mn Casino Ignition Casino Bonus Code Casinos In Iowa Durant Casino Hotel Louisville Casino</h1>

<p>No I was NOT aware! I always play at high stakes and the casino was aware of this when they saw that I was playing $50 to table maximum when I was losing my own $800 I deposited. Why do you assume that I was aware of this language buried in the lengthy terms and conditions? If I had known the bet limit was $10 I obviously would not have bet more than $10 with the bonus because then I would know I could not cash out any winnings!</p>
<p>According to CasinoGuru's statement of it position on casino terms and conditions, your platform states:</p>
<p>"Our position</p>
<p>We do not tolerate any hidden or predatory rules because they are unfair towards players and put them at a disadvantage. If we notice them during our review process or if they are brought to our attention through a player complaint, we decrease the reputation rating and also try to get the casino to start behaving fairly if it's within our capabilities."</p>
<p>Here, Shazam's terms and conditions are clearly unfair and predatory in violation of CasinoGuru standards. I played the same way I always play, and I can't imagine playing blackjack as such low and boring stakes as less than $10 per hand, that's absurd, and it defeats the entire point which is placing bets high enough that will generate excitement. For some players perhaps they get excited betting $1 or even 10 cents per hand, for them they will jump up and down if they win a $1 bet on blackjack. That is not be nor higher stakes players in general. We are accustomed to playing at higher stakes. This a a predatory term and condition that Shazam is abusing to steal winnings from high rollers that will most CERTAINLY bet more than a mere $10 without being even made aware of the $10 max bet limitation.</p>
<p>In a physical casino, there are table maximums and minimum, and it was reasonable for me to assume as I did that it was proper for me to bet within the table minimum and maximum set by the casino, I never bet more than the table maximum. Shazam never informed me when they gave the cash back of this $10 limit, despite knowing I am use to playing most hands at table maximum. Shazam knew that I was not made aware of this provision, and abused it to unfairly and unlawfully steal my winnings.</p>
<p>I submit that the provision and its use by Shazam, especially the way they used to is confiscate my legitimate winning under the facts of this case was predatory, and violated CasinoGuru standards.</p>
