<p>888 Holdings has appointed Ben Hurst as its new vice president for North American market expansion</p>
<p>The London-listed leading operator of betting and gaming services that acquired William Hill’s global business in 2022 has taken more steps toward building and implementing fresh strategies for strengthening its foothold in North America.</p>
<p>Proven Skills Over the Years</p>
<p>The fact that the group that currently employs more than 11,000 people globally has chosen Ben Hurst as its new vice president for market expansion is not random.</p>
<p>Hurst has already worked as an independent consultant for 888 in the previous year, providing his excellent potential. Now, he will be busy working to increase the group’s presence in Canada and the US alongside the rest of the management team for the region.</p>
<p>The group’s president for the US Howard Mittman has expressed delight to have Hurst join their US team from the position of the new vice president. Mittman, who had worked with Hurst over the last year as a consultant, has also confidently spoken about the new VP’s “knowledge of the industry” and of the company itself.</p>
<p>According to Mittman, these two arguments were just right to turn Hurst into the right leader who would assist the group in its ongoing effort to boost its business in the US in the future.</p>
<p>The group has not been neglecting its expansion outside the North American market either. In March, 888 announced it had signed an important media partnership with Wavemaker for UK brands.</p>
<p>The president also mentioned Hurst’s “exceptional track record” at prestigious media companies worldwide. Here is a quick rundown below.</p>
<p>Paramount and Madison Square Garden Sports &amp; Entertainment Positions</p>
<p>Describing himself as a “results-oriented digital, sports, and entertainment executive with nearly two decades of experience”, Hurst worked for Madison Square Garden Sports &amp; Entertainment between June 2019 and June 2022.</p>
<p>There, he was responsible for overseeing all digital initiatives for the company’s brands and properties as senior vice president and head of digital.</p>
<p>He also collaborated with Viacom, the leading producer of top entertainment content enjoyed by billions of people. For nine years between 2009 and 2018, Hurst occupied important positions such as senior vice president, mobile/emerging platforms, and digital partnerships.</p>
<p>He was also busy managing Comedy Central’s digital/mobile division, along with TV Land, CMT, MTV, VH1, Logo, and Paramount Network.</p>
<p>From his new VP position with 888, Hurst is expected to help the business grow, collect competitive intelligence, and generate state-of-the-art operational strategy and direction. He will also be responsible for keeping close ties with 888’s strategic partner Authentic Brands Group to further grow the Sports Illustrated brand in the US.</p>
<p>After the news of the appointment was made public, shares in 888 Holdings plc were trading at 80.60 pence per share ($0.91) marking a 0.12% drop. In mid-April, 888 reported mixed results with important rises in its adjusted EBITDA and yearly revenue and a net loss of £120 million ($150 million).</p>
