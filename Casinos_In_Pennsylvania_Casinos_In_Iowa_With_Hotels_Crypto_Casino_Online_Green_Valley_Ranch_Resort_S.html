<p>Provider of iGaming and sports content LEAP Gaming has expanded its existing partnership with Kaizen Gaming International and the latter’s Betano brand. This new collaboration covers virtual sports provided by Leap Gaming and will cover the Romanian market.</p>
<p>LEAP has welcomed the opportunity to strengthen what the company has described as a strong alliance between the two companies. The company added that thanks to this move, it will be able to offer Romanian customers of the Betano brand a number of titles, including Virtual Football Cup V2, Football Penalty Duel, NASCAR Streak and other popular products.</p>
<p>This partnership extension comes after LEAP entered the Romanian market after acquiring the necessary supplier license from the Romanian National Gambling Office or ONJN in March this year.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, LEAP Gaming Head of Customer Success Andreea Stiru said that the launch of the ultra-realistic Virtual Sports portfolio is welcomed as an important milestone for the company. Stiru explained that LEAP was pleased to deepen its ties with Kaizen and ensure that a valuable partner receives top-quality content.</p>
<p>She added that LEAP had a track record for delivering entertaining content across a number of markets. Kaizen Gaming Product Manager Vangelis Kalloudis was similarly pleased about the new partnership and welcomed the innovative, fast and unique content brought to Betano thanks to the Virtual Sports portfolio.</p>
<p>LEAP Gaming has been actively increasing its footprint across Europe. The company entered the Swedish market earlier this year, describing the event as a "milestone" achievement at the time, as reported by Casino Guru. The company used this as the basis of future success to follow.</p>
<p>In June, LEAP secured another important certification, this time unlocking the doors to the Danish iGaming market, one of Europe’s safest and most sustainable jurisdictions in terms of online casino potential. The company has been working on a number of partnerships as well. It partnered up with another recognizable name in the industry, BoyleSports again in June.</p>
<p>Increasing its presence across the entirety of Europe, LEAP was similarly able to secure a license in Lithuania, moving its content and product reach a step further yet. The biggest company success to date could be perhaps its entry into the United Kingdom, arguably the most well-developed regulated iGaming market in Europe.</p>
<p>LEAP Gaming has been expanding across the continent and methodically consolidating its reach. The latest deal is just one of many steps to follow.</p>
