    <h1>Cast Casino Royale James Bond Best Casino In Laughlin Hollywood Casino Tunica Ms Limitless Casino No</h1>

<p>I made a $42,110.53 deposit to Sportsbetting.ag by bitcoin on Friday, October 30, 2020. I used the boosted bitcoin/USD conversion rate offer, so my only requirement was to play through the deposit amount at least 3 times. I didn't claim any deposit bonus or play in the bonus account. After a check yesterday, Nov 11, 2020, my accomplished rollover amount was $129,050 after the deposit - thus well over the requirement. But this doesn't help, the site consistently blocks my access to the withdrawal page and persistently refuses me to even request a withdrawal, which I have been trying to do ever since the first night when I finished the rollover requirement. The balance I would try to withdraw is now $48,418.69, so some winnings on top of my original deposit. I also played poker a little bit but only made losses. The winnings are from the casino.</p>
<p>The customer support tells me a load of conflicting and misleading information. Most of all they claim all the time that I should be able to withdraw. But it doesn't help me, the site blocks my access to the request page.</p>
<p>The procedure with the support goes for example like this:</p>
<p>Me: I can't access the withdrawal page. I only get a message that a withdrawal isn't possible. Why? (I send a screenshot)</p>
<p>CS: You haven't completed the 3 x rollover, that's the reason.</p>
<p>Me: Ok, how much do I still have the rollover left?</p>
<p>CS: Glad to help you with this. Just go and request a withdrawal after that we will see the remaining rollover.</p>
<p>Me: I can't access the withdrawal page... (on and on forever)</p>
<p>Sometimes they start to count the achieved rollover for me on the chat. After saying they are almost finished, they still keep me waiting about one full hour and then just disconnect me.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get this answer:</p>
<p>Me: I can't access the withdrawal page. I only get a message that a withdrawal isn't possible. Why? (I send a screenshot)</p>
<p>CS: Your account needs verification, just send in your documents.</p>
<p>But about every other time:</p>
<p>Me: I can't access the withdrawal page. I only get a message that a withdrawal isn't possible. Why? (I send a screenshot)</p>
<p>CS: Your account is already verified and your documents approved. You just haven't met the rollover requirement...</p>
<p>When I sent my id documents, they never responded with a confirmation or updates about any verification. I never knew about any verification until they said on the chat after I asked why I can't access the withdraw page.</p>
<p>No one informs me practically about anything. Many times I don't get responses to emails. Many times I get conflicting and misleading information, they just kick me around from here to there... Or keep me waiting and waiting in vain.</p>
<p>Last night I managed to get the CS agent count my rollover amount: $129050. He confirmed that is fulfills the rollover requirement for a withdrawal. He said that after the midnight their casino "clears", so after that I can finally go to the cashier and withdraw.</p>
<p>I did that but still I can't withdraw my balance.</p>
<p>I said that this is the last drop. I need at least my original deposit amount back. I don't see it right that Sportsbetting.ag can take my own deposited money and keep it to themselves just like that, without me having any right to withdraw it back anymore.</p>
