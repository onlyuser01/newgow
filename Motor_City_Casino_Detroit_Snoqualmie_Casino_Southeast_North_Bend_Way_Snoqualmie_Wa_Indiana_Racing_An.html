    <h1>Motor City Casino Detroit Snoqualmie Casino Southeast North Bend Way Snoqualmie Wa Indiana Racing An</h1>

<p>The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency released Wednesday its June casino gaming report to reveal that the state’s six privately owned casinos did not have the best of a month in June but managed to complete fiscal 2022 with a bang.</p>
<p>Surpassing Significant Milestone</p>
<p>Maryland casinos generated revenues of $162.7 million in June to post their first month since March 2022 with revenues lower than $170 million. Compared with June 2021, the casinos posted slight revenue growth of 0.8%.</p>
<p>Despite the small setback in June, the last month of the fiscal year 2022, the six casinos managed to generate over $2 billion for the entire fiscal year, up $257 million, or 14.7% from the fiscal year 2021’s $1.75 billion, bringing Maryland’s lifetime revenue to $13.8 billion.</p>
<p>In June, the state of Maryland received $68.4 million in casino contributions to support its education trust fund, general fund, as well as small business and businesses owned by women and minorities.</p>
<p>Leaders Retained Positions</p>
<p>MGM National Harbor and Live! Casino &amp; Hotel ranked first and second well ahead of the remaining four, accounting for 76% of the state’s total revenue. Compared year-over-year, MGM extended the gap after its revenues increased by 7.4% while revenues at Live! Casino &amp; Hotel decreased by 4.2%. Horseshoe Casino Baltimore came third posting a marginal increase of 0.2% year-over-year.</p>
<p>The other three casinos, Ocean Downs Casino, Hollywood Perryville and Rocky Gap Casino, posted $8.6 million, $7.4 million and $5.3 million to account for year-over-year decreases ranging from 3.3% to 7.2%.</p>
<p>Considered across verticals, $108.7 million of the total, or 67%, came from slot win, with the biggest share generated by Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Maryland – $40.8 million – followed closely by MGM National Harbor with $38 million. Horseshoe Casino Baltimore came third with $11 million.</p>
<p>The remaining $54 million came from table games operations where MGM National Harbor was the undisputed leader with $30.4 million, twice as much as the second-placed Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Maryland which accounted for $15.2 million, and five times more than the third – Horseshoe Casino Baltimore – with $6.1 million.</p>
