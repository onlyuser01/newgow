<p>Gordon Moody, a UK-based charity that is dedicated to offering support and treatment to individuals who suffer from gambling-related harm, has announced the appointment of Monica Shafaq as its new Chief Executive Officer. She is stepping in the shoes of the interim CEO Matthew Hickey, who will support the transition and pass on the baton.</p>
<p>This move will strengthen the charity’s commitment to ensuring that it stays at the forefront of gambling-related treatment as Shafaq prepares to step into the position in January 2024. She is a valuable acquisition for the charity as well, as she worked with The Kaleidoscope Plus Group, which focuses on mental health and well-being, for 13 years. Shafaq welcomed the chance to be a part of the Gordon Moody’s team and its leadership:</p>
<p>"Together, we will work tirelessly to raise awareness, provide support, and a path to recovery. I am excited to collaborate with existing partners and stakeholders as well as forging new relationships to drive meaningful change."</p>
<p>Shafaq is hailed as an individual who has committed to improving individual well-being and personal betterment, which is precisely what Gordon Moody seeks to achieve through its work in the gambling sector. Shafaq is also going to try and improve on Hickey’s track record which has been impressive, with the charity providing treatment to 270 people a year now, from formerly 120.</p>
<p>Under Hickey’s stint, Gordon Moody also opened a women-only residential treatment center in 2021, aligned with the realization that women gamblers can be just as vulnerable to the game’s pernicious effects. As to applications, they have gone up to 885 from 619 in 2022, suggesting that Hickey has worked on improving the overall awareness for the charity.</p>
<p>Her appointment was similarly welcomed by Gordon Moody Trustee Claire Arnold who was pleased to see Shafaq step in the important role. "Monica brings a wealth of experience from her work in the charity sector, most recently from The Kaleidoscope Plus Group and her energy for achieving social change will be a huge asset to Gordon Moody," Arnold added.</p>
<p>Gordon Moody also previously teamed up with Casino Guru for a new Safer Gambling Course, aligned with both organizations' mission to promote safer gambling and help consumers and organizations better understand the risks associated with gambling. Gordon Moody is also backed by the Entain Foundation.</p>
