    <h1>No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes Instant Play Pulze Online Casino Casinos In Biloxi Tunica Mississippi</h1>

<p>I joined JOO and deposited $750. Per their 100 percent sign up bonus my account showed $1500. No distinction was made between my money and the bonus money.</p>
<p>I played live table games with a max bet of $50. After a few days my results were.</p>
<p>$809.18. (total wagered)</p>
<p>$1,2435. (total won)</p>
<p>$426.22 (net total)</p>
<p>$1176.22 (balance)</p>
<p>Joo then took it upon themselves and with no notification to confiscate $525.42 based on bonus rule 2.2. I was told I exceeded the maximum bet of $5.</p>
<p>This is a shameless freeroll. They allowed me to place bets with no intention of honoring them. If I lose they keep it, if I win they take it back. Only with their crooked math would I end up being down -$99.20 as well.</p>
<p>My balance now shows $650.80.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I deposited $750 and was never behind very much. I assumed I was gambling with my money and not the bonus.</p>
<p>Live chat simply said there is nothing that can be done since I breached their bonus T&amp;C.</p>
<p>I emailed their support, 2 days no reply.</p>
