<p>Scout Gaming has penned a new partnership agreement with the Brazilian fantasy sports operator Cartola and will supply it with fantasy sports products.</p>
<p>Scout Gaming Group, a provider of fantasy sports to regulated gaming operators, has expanded its presence in Brazil through a new deal with a local fantasy operator. Cartola, the operator in question, will receive access to the supplier’s exciting fantasy products.</p>
<p>Scout Gaming Expands in Brazil</p>
<p>Under the deal with Cartola, Scout Gaming Group will power the Brazilian brand with its critically-acclaimed fantasy sports products. The provider, which serves various markets in Europe and beyond, will now get the chance to further broaden its horizons and expand its reach.</p>
<p>Scout Gaming is based in Sweden and offers both business-to-business and business-to-customer fantasy sports and sports betting products. It also has operating hubs in Norway and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Cartola, meanwhile, is a Brazilian daily fantasy sports company with big plans for the future. The company has planned the product launch for the first quarter of the next year and hopes to take the fantasy market by storm. The Cartola brand is owned by DFS Entretenimento, a local entertainment company.</p>
<p>Scout Gaming is excited to support Cartola with its fantasy and daily fantasy products. Niklas Jönsson, the chief executive officer of Scout Gaming Group, said that he is honored that Cartola picked his company over its competitors and said that the expansion in Brazil feels very positive. Jönsson and his team are excited to support the Brazilian fantasy operator and are looking forward to the upcoming cooperation.</p>
<p>A Year of Ups and Downs for Scout Gaming</p>
<p>Scout Gaming Group continues to break ground in the fantasy sports sector while continuously expanding its reach. The provider continues to eye launches in new markets and is constantly looking to expand its business.</p>
<p>Two months ago, the fantasy provider made a foray into the Australian betting market thanks to its agreement with Apple iSports, an Australian operator of free-to-play fantasy games and sports betting. Under an agreement much similar to the one with Cartola, Scout Gaming agreed to power Apple iSports with a full suite of sports betting and fantasy sports solutions.</p>
<p>Despite its ambitions, Scout Gaming’s journey is not always easy. In August, the company posted its results for the first half of the year. During that period, the supplier recorded an unfortunate 47% decline in gaming revenue. The company attributed the suboptimal results to the difficulties it faced during the period and the high costs of business.</p>
<p>The financial troubles Scout Gaming faced eventually forced it to cut its workforce in half and streamline its business.</p>
