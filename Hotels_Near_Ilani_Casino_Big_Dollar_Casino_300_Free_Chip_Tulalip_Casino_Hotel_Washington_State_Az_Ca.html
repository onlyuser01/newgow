<p>In light of the recent cyberattack that disrupted MGM Resorts’ operations, the iconic strip club has extended a helping hand to affected tourists, offering them an array of unique perks to ease their stress and ensure their Sin City experience remains unforgettable.</p>
<p>Cyberattack Rocks MGM Resorts, Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club Offers Respite</p>
<p>The MGM Resorts cyberattack, which struck at the beginning of the week, plunged some visitors into chaos as they struggled to access their hotel rooms or complete check-in procedures. The fallout even extended to casino slot machines and phone lines, adding to the frustration of travelers in town for a good time.</p>
<p>Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club wasted no time stepping up to the plate, recognizing the need to alleviate the distress of both guests and hospitality employees grappling with the situation. Brittany Rose, the club’s general manager, conveyed her heartfelt empathy for those affected, reported TMZ. She mentioned that their hearts went out to both the employees and the tourists impacted by the devastating event. As members of the hospitality industry, they had decided to contribute to enhancing the guest experience during their visit to Las Vegas, with the aim of easing the stress experienced by the employees who were diligently handling the situation.</p>
<p>For those guests who endured the cyberattack’s turmoil and are at least 21 years old, Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club is offering an impressive array of freebies. To partake in this unique offer, visitors simply need to present proof of a valid hotel reservation at any MGM property from September 10 onwards. The freebies include airport pickup, luggage storage to accommodate check-in delays, a complimentary $1,200 platinum VIP membership, and, of course, free lap dances. However, this generous offer is only available until September 24, so affected tourists should make the most of it while they can.</p>
<p>Cyberattack Brings Unexpected Windfall for Las Vegas Adult Entertainment Venues</p>
<p>While the cyberattack left many visitors grappling with inconvenience, it inadvertently boosted business for the city’s adult entertainment establishments. Strip Club Concierge, another Sin City gentlemen’s club, reported a surge in foot traffic, reservations, and ride service usage in the wake of the attack. Strippers even saw a substantial increase in earnings, with some bringing in up to $2,000 more per night.</p>
<p>The recently experienced cyberattack on MGM Resorts International is believed to be the work of the Scattered Spider group, a notorious cybercriminal organization known for using social engineering to obtain login credentials and OTP codes.</p>
<p>The attack has had a significant impact on MGM’s business, leading to a decline in its stock price, email and website shutdowns, and potential losses. Moody’s credit rating agency has warned that MGM’s credit rating may be negatively affected due to security weaknesses. Similar cyberattacks have targeted other companies, including Caesars Entertainment and Stake.com.</p>
