    <h1>Casino 1995 Barona Resort Casino Wildcat Canyon Road Lakeside Ca Wind Creek Casino Rv Park Miami Clu</h1>

<p>Dear Jozef,</p>
<p>I have thoroughly reviewed the case, apologies for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>As you probably aware, CasinoMidas is treating responsible gambling with outmost urgent attention- customers are approaching our support team with daily matters, where our team is always trying to protect them in the best way depending on their personal scenario.</p>
<p>In some cases we define with the player their "comfort zone" with regards to their gambling entertainments, setting the limits and compensate with slightly higher bonus ratio so they can play longer with a lower budget.</p>
<p>In most cases, customers are happy and feeling protected as they are aware that they are playing in a place keeping them within their boundaries (as opposed to keep opening accounts with new casinos and playing with no limitations). In the rest of the cases, we face 2 main behaviours:</p>
<p>Customers express the need to stop gambling completely which we follow their guidelines.</p>
<p>Customers are using our flexible bonus plan to get more and more, which we must draw the line at some point.</p>
<p>In any case, our responsible gambling team is reviewing the players accounts regularly, looking to identify compulsive behaviour, such as withdrawal cancellations and chasing losses habits.</p>
<p>CasinoMidas is not free from human mistakes and Casino Guru will testify that in the rare scenario where wrong decisions are made, we are compensating for any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>With regards to the esteemed client who opened this claim, our team did not flag her account for compulsive disorder and did allow her to reopen her account upon her request- reason being that her account closure requests where linked with bonus demands- when we could, we credited the bonus, when we couldnâ€™t, the account got closed and was reopened later on as per the players request.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some claims made on this thread were not correct, for example, upon the requests to close the account on February 24th, the customer's account was closed on the same day, it was then reopened 3 days later upon the customer's request, so her claim on the forum that her account was not closed at that time is incorrect as she had asked for it to be reopened, therefore her account was not open from the 24 till March continuously.</p>
<p>If the customer will allow us to share with the forum, we can share a lot of communications where different technics to receive bonuses were used, including an unfortunate demand to receive 3000 Euro bonus or else she will open a claim on CasinoGuru, which is the one we are corresponding on.</p>
<p>CasinoMidas, a well-established brand for over 10 years is not obliged to make any refunds to the username in question, especially as the brand can not respond well to threats and blackmail of any kind. Nonetheless, if Casino Guru is asking us to consider compensation although the information elaborated above, we can do so. In any case, I can confirm that her Casino Midas account has been permanently blocked.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>John Paul - Casino Manager</p>
