<p>Bragg Gaming Group has expanded its reach in Ontario through the rollout of its Remote Game Server technology with bet365, a prominent and established brand in the province, as well as a global online casino and sports betting giant.</p>
<p>The partnership enables bet365 to quickly access a range of Bragg Gaming Group’s original and third-party content, significantly improving both partners’ standing in the local market. North America has long been a focal point of Bragg’s continuous growth efforts, with the latest tie-up another step in that direction.</p>
<p>Among the titles that bet365 players can expect to find are games such as Fairy Dust by Atomic Slot Lab and Sea of Plenty from Indigo Magic. The supplier is also bringing a range of third-party game experiences through the Powered by Bragg portfolio. The content is made easily available to bet365 and the brand’s players owing to the powerful RGS technology that facilitates the gaming experience on the website.</p>
<p>A bet365 spokesperson has welcomed the opportunity to see the company’s footprint further strengthened in the market with the addition of Bragg and the company’s cutting-edge games. "Customers in Ontario will now be able to enjoy an even wider selection of market-leading titles within our Games product," bet365 stated.</p>
<p>Bragg’s President and Chief Operating Officer Lara Falzon was similarly pleased to see this partnership shape up. This new content introduction with bet365, Falzon said, was another opportunity for the company to expand in leading iGaming markets.</p>
<p>"With Ontario pacing as one of the largest iGaming markets in North America, our partnership with bet365 will play an important role in our North American growth strategy and help drive consistent, long-term growth," Falzon added.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group has been actively working to increase its presence in global markets, with the company recently expanding its existing ties with Unibet to the United Kingdom. The company has similarly worked on other partnerships, including content alliances with global brands such as PokerStars and 888, demonstrating the company’s staying power and momentum in iGaming.</p>
