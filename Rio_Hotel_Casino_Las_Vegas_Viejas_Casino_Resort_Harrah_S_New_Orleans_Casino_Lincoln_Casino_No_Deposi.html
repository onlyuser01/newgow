    <h1>Rio Hotel Casino Las Vegas Viejas Casino Resort Harrah S New Orleans Casino Lincoln Casino No Deposi</h1>

<p>iSoftBet has recently released a new fishing-themed game called Crabbin’ Crazy. The game was inspired by Deadliest Catch, a popular TV series dedicated to fishing fans. The leading online casino games supplier decided to release a game that would primarily address light-hearted players who love to fish for riches. The cool theme and graphics, bonus features, and modifiers that can be triggered randomly are prone to turn Crabbin’ Crazy into an action-packed game.</p>
<p>Grab a Rod and Let the Crab Fishing Begin!</p>
<p>Crabbin’ Crazy is the freshest addition to the company’s continuously evolving portfolio of slots that features highly-performing Hold &amp; Win and Megaways titles, along with the award-winning Moriarty Megaways game.</p>
<p>Crabbin’ Crazy invites players to go on a fun and lucrative crab fishing adventure. The medium to the highly volatile game that allows players to win up to 1585x their bet features a 96% RTP. The minimum bet is set at 0.25, with a maximum bet of 25. Crabbin’ Crazy has a hit frequency of a little over 28%, 25 paylines, five reels, and three rows.</p>
<p>Players will have the pleasure of discovering a series of excellent features that will assist them in their endeavor to catch crabs: wild symbols, Hold &amp; Win respins, Pick A Crab, and Free Spins Frenzy.</p>
<p>Pick A Crab</p>
<p>On any of the base game spins, the fisherman can pop up and bring players the Pick A Crab feature. Opting for one of the three crabs will automatically trigger one of the four available modifiers: Bonus Add, Let’s Catch Crabs, Win Spin, or Stacked Wilds. The Bonus Add modifier will be responsible for adding scatter symbols to the reels, thus boosting a player’s chance of enabling the bonus game. The Let’s Catch Crabs modifier will reward a player with three or four crab symbols, by landing the wild symbol on the reels. The Win Spin modifier will be responsible for adding a series of mystery symbols to the reels. The Stacked Wilds modifier will display at least a couple of super stacked wild symbols.</p>
<p>Free Spins Frenzy</p>
<p>Landing three scatter symbols on the first, third, or fifth reel will enable the Free Spins Frenzy feature. This means the player will be given eight free spins with two to five reels spinning in sync. With each new spin, a different and completely random number of synced reels will be used.</p>
<p>Hold &amp; Win Respins</p>
<p>A player who manages to land at least five crabs on a single spin will also get to trigger the special Let’s Go Crabbin’ Respins feature. This feature will reward them with a Hold &amp; Win type of bonus featuring three respins. The respins will become active as soon as a new crab will land on the reels. The crab symbols feature different values, with the special rainbow crab paying up to 1000X the bet. Landing the fisherman symbol means collecting all crab values and clearing the reels on the spot.</p>
<p>iSoftBet’s head of games Mark Claxton talked about the new game’s fun fishing theme and generous modifiers, bonus rounds, and excellent win potential as features that will add more diversity to their slot portfolio. Following the same desire to evolve, iSoftBet has launched the Jackpot Tool, a fully-customizable solution that enables casino operators to improve their player engagement and retention rates with more ease. Crabbin’ Crazy can be played on desktops, as well as notepad and mobiles devices.</p>
