<p>Hi Kristina,</p>
<p>in other words you are saying we support casinos to take restricted countrys !?what about stand up and punish them for doing this .yes i am robbed see my previous complaints robbed by curacao casinos who alter the RNG results to scam the players from restricted countrys .5 or 6 casino same paterns impossible to profit .only time you can win is a real live game all others are crap.you as a gambling platform respected my country regulations and blocked the netherlands .why should casinos can go away with it .there are a few who ghink they are above the law and keep taking free money with out license and taxes .i would see really that casino guru wil stand up against this kind of fraud and punish them .there is a reason players looking outside to play because they have excluded themselfs from gambling and these casinos destroy that will and bring them in bigger problems .if the casino state in the terms that the country is restricted then it should act like that and block the country .this is pure fraud .all deposit option are blocked and the casinos keep finding another way so player can deposit .with out crypto i will not be able to deposit and play .i hope the crypto will banned too .how can you take a casino seriously if they breach their own license and terms .how can you trust their games if they breach their license .who can proof me then that the games are fair ?last time i talked to a chat member in a casino it was his first day .i told him about my concerns about the games he immidiatly told me that the games are fair .i mean how you know that?asking for proof for years only thing they say is just look on the site .i am done with gambling .taking my mondy and lying is disgusting .i think vavada should consider to refund my deposits .i had no play at all .and they are illegal in my country.altering the terms in them favor makes it more fraudulent .if casinos state in their terms country restriction and i cant enter the site then i will not be able to deposit and play and move on .these company responsibility is a joke .i will make sure they will be blocked here .benefieting without paying for license and taxes is criminal.we al have to pay taxes for our incomes they are no different .</p>
