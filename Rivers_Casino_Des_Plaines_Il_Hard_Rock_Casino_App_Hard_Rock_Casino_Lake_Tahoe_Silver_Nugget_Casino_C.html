<p>Information about Sticpay casinos</p>
<p>E-wallets are becoming more popular in the world of online payments, and Sticpay is a well-known e-wallet provider. Operating at a global level, it allows users to send and receive money via their Sticpay account regardless of where both parties are located, and also provides merchants with a reliable payment gateway for their products and services.</p>
<p>Among those merchants are online casinos who accept Sticpay as a deposit method due to its high security and anti-fraud measures. This page will help you find a reliable Sticpay online casino that's the best choice for you according to your needs, how to find bonuses offered by Sticpay casinos, as well as information about Sticpay itself.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Sticpay: an award-winning e-wallet provider</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Sticpay is a London-based Fintech company that provides an e-wallet service to end-users and merchants in a range of industries, including eCommerce and online gambling.</p>
<p>The company has grown at a rapid rate since its formation, expanding its network to customers and merchants across the world. It has struck up important partnerships with card providers such as Mastercard and Visa, as well as several cryptocurrency platforms, so that users can transfer money into their Sticpay account easily, and vice versa. The service is also affiliated with Apple and Google Pay.</p>
<p>An additional feature available to Sticpay customers is the Stic Card, a prepaid option that can be used in all the countries that Sticpay operates in, including nations in Europe, North America and Asia.</p>
<p>Despite its youth, Sticpay won the Payments Awards' Best Digital Wallet 2019, Traders Awards' Best Service in Singapore 2019, and Future Digital Awards' Best Online Payments 2019 within its first two years of trading. It is also registered with the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, so all of its activities are closely regulated for users' protection.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of Sticpay</p>
<p>An important positive of Sticpay's service is its commitment to quick registration and instant payments. If you want to make a Sticpay deposit at an online casino, registration takes just a few minutes after which your payment should be processed within a few seconds. This is great for players who just want to crack on with playing the games.</p>
<p>Sticpay also prides itself on its tough security measures, which may be a part of the reason why it is used by online casinos. The company rigorously checks all users and end-merchants and uses Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) measures to validate their identity. It even employs a special Compliance Team to monitor all Sticpay transactions.</p>
<p>Note: While some customers might find these extra checks tedious, they will appeal to the safety-conscious user; plus it means there is no risk of chargeback fees, according to the company, as every transaction via the platform is 100% secure.</p>
<p>The widespread availability of Sticpay should also be seen as a positive. The fact that it operates in most countries and supports many different currencies makes it a viable option for people in smaller nations where payment options might be limited. It also means that users can withdraw funds in more places using the Stic Card, so if you sign up and decide to go travelling to far-flung places, you may well have it as a payment option.</p>
<p>In terms of downsides, some users may not enjoy the fees that Sticpay charge. Unlike some providers, which waive the charges for some translations, Sticpay levies a charge for each one, so, although they may not be much, regular users may find that they mount up. For exact fee amounts, check out the official Sticpay website.</p>
<p>Using Sticpay in online casinos</p>
<p>Sticpay is a highly trusted way to deposit funds into your online casino account and you can do it as follows.</p>
<p>Firstly, you need to ensure that you have an account at your chosen Sticpay casino, as well as a Sticpay account. If not, then signing up to either or both of them should only take a few minutes.</p>
<p>Once that's done, head to the casino's cashier section, where you should be able to choose Sticpay as your preferred payment method. Then, it's a case of entering in your Sticpay details, the amount you want to deposit and the currency, if necessary.</p>
<p>Before clicking the payment icon, it's always a good idea to double-check your details in case of errors. When you're sure, go ahead and pay: your casino funds should be ready for you to use almost immediately.</p>
<p>It's possible that some casinos will allow you to withdraw funds to your Sticpay account, too. If you want to do this, then follow a similar procedure, but head to the withdrawal section of the casino website instead. Withdrawals often take longer than deposits and are sometimes subject to different fees: you should check these with the casino beforehand.</p>
