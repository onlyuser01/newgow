<p>The Arkansas Racing Commission has finally solved a pressing matter in the way the state aids and helps vulnerable gamblers. Starting this week, the Arkansas Problem Gambling Council will be stepping in as the official educational and treatment service for the regulator and state. This comes four years after gambling was introduced and after the commission vowed to contribute $200,000 a year to tackle problem gambling, but had no entity to help it with this ambitious goal.</p>
<p>Long Delayed and Hotly Debated</p>
<p>The contract will extend through October 31, 2023, with the option of renewal if the Arkansas Problem Gambling Council delivers on results. The entity, which is an NGO tasked with tackling problem gambling, can use the additional funding to help steer Arkansas towards a more sustainable gambling future.</p>
<p>The Arkansans Problem Gambling Council is also uniquely qualified to spearhead this effort as it works with a nationwide network of professionals and mental health specialists who can advise and offer insight into policies that can have an impact on aiding locals. This reputation has been one of the reasons why the Gambling Council was picked in the end.</p>
<p>Then again, the Arkansas Problem Gambling Council and Harbor House were the only two groups to sign up for the call of proposals and the only organizations to actually have an insight into problem gambling. The organization has welcomed this opportunity, with council board chairwoman Vena Schexnayder not hiding her enthusiasm:</p>
<p>I am excited and hopeful for the new services and treatment opportunities for all Arkansans. Problem Gambling Council board chairwoman Vena Schexnayder</p>
<p>The move, while a reason for celebration, was delayed as the authorization for tackling problem gambling in the state was passed only during the present fiscal year, and not before the Denton &amp; Zachary law firm had to file a lawsuit this summer, bringing it to the Racing Commission’s attention that it had been running gambling without one of its mandatory pillars envisaged in the rules.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also demanded that the defendants – in this case the Racing Commission – pay restitution compensating, reimbursing and rewarding the funds under previous years, to wit $200,000 for each of the missed funding years in 2019, 2022, and 2021. This is $600,000 in arrears so far.</p>
