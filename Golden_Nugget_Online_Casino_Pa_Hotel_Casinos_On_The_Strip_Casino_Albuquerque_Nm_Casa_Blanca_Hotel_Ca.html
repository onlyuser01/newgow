<p>The next bout in the UFC is set for September 4, 2021, and it will feature the talents of Derek Brunson and Darren Till who are headlining the fight. Posted at diametrically opposed odds, one of the two fighters is set to win while the other will have to take another loss to their record unless the fight ends as a tie.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen often, though, and the UFC Vegas 36 event is going to broadcast the main card at 4 pm EST. Brunson is posted at (+145) as the underdog whereas Till seems to carry the crown of the favorite with (-170). Does this mean we can expect a fairly straightforward fight in which Till brings home another victory? We really ought to wait and see.</p>

<p>Where Is Till vs Brunson Taking Place?</p>
<p>Date : Saturday, September 4</p>
<p>: Saturday, September 4 Time : 9 pm EST</p>
<p>: 9 pm EST Location: Las Vegas, Nevada, USA</p>
<p>The fight between Till and Brunson was originally planned for the O2 Arena in London but had to be rescheduled and is now heading for Las Vegas this Saturday, September 4. The main card will be broadcast on ESPN+ at 4 pm EST.</p>
<p>Till Returns to the UFC, Will He Win?</p>
<p>A lot now rides on Darren Till who is tapped as the favorite and not surprisingly so. Till has captivated fans and he seems to be antagonizing other UFC middleweight fighters who are now looking to secure a fight against him.</p>
<p>One of those is Israel Adesanya, the middleweight champion who is keen on meeting Till in the hexagon. Yet, for this to happen, Till will first have to overcome Brunson who has a solid record.</p>
<p>In fact, Brunson has lost all of his last four fights and even though his overall record is 22-7-0, he seems like a prime candidate to bring in another win. Till on the other hand it a little more difficult of late. He fought Robert Whittaker in a spectacular several-bout and ended up losing by decision.</p>
<p>He took on Jorge Masvidal and lost by KO to the disappointment of fans. Of course, Till is only 28 and he is in a much better overall shape. He has only had two UFC finishes two, compared to Brunson’s eight.</p>
<p>Brunson vs Till Tale of the Tape</p>
<p>Brunson Stats Till 37 Age 28 6’1″ Height 6’0″ 77″ Reach 75″ 8 UFC Finishes 2</p>
<p>Brunson may be old, but he still sports superior overall physical attributes and that is precisely what is going to give Till trouble. The underdog does have one weakness and that is a direct punch to his chin.</p>
<p>Brunson seems unable to withstand punches to his face, and that is not a statement that should be shocking per se. However, there are fighters who definitely seem unfazed after receiving a few bad hits, but Brunson just isn’t one of them.</p>
<p>This means that if Till manages to connect early or even in mid-round, he will almost certainly bring the victory home. Betting on Till to win via KO/TKO would be the logical thing here if you are looking for a mode of victory.</p>
<p>There is one small pitfall, however, and that is Brunson’s wrestling. If he gets a hold of Till we don’t see him getting out of that.</p>
