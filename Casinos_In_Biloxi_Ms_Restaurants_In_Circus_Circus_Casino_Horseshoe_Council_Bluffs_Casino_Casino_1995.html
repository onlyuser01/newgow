<p>Swintt has expanded its reach in the Dutch iGaming market with Joi Gaming, and the company’s locally recognized brand Jacks.nl. This partnership is the second strong foray that the supplier of online casino gaming content makes in the Netherlands. It’s an important part of Swintt’s long-term strategy in the market and reflects its commitment to the country’s players and operators.</p>
<p>Swintt, which has enjoyed strong growth in European markets, has been open about its ambitions for the Dutch iGaming. The partnership covers a range of titles that will be now part of Jacks.nl’s portfolio of titles available locally to players. Those include Seven Seven, Extra Win X, Aqua Lord, and Master of Books. The games have been developed to provide players with a variety of experiences and feature-rich gameplay.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of this product offer is that the Premium Games by Swintt are distinguished games that will help Jacks.nl stand out in the market as it’s only getting started. The Netherlands regulated its iGaming market one year ago and is still in the process of growing its reach, which means that there is plenty of room for worthwhile content to be introduced to the market and strike home with player bases.</p>
<p>This is precisely what Swintt is going for. Company Chief Executive Officer David Mann was stoked at this opportunity, and he welcomed the chance for his company to strengthen its position in the Dutch iGaming market. Mann is convinced that Swintt can become the go-to supplier, and Jacks.nl is already a brand with a formidable local presence, the executive explains.</p>
<p>Mann is excited about this particular partnership as it allows Swintt to finally showcase its innovative portfolio of titles that will bring fresh experiences to players. The partnership was welcomed by Sjoerd Kranz, the current Casino Manager for Joi Gaming, who said that the company’s flagship brand, Jacks.nl, only stands to benefit from adding Swintt titles.</p>
<p>Jacks.nl has an undeniable leadership status in the country and as such, it’s constantly looking for new ways to secure more content from prestigious studios. Swintt fits the bill nicely, Kranz explained. Swintt has been expanding rapidly in Europe and it was able to achieve a new major milestone in September when the company secured a supplier license from the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>This significantly boosted the company’s operational reach and made it possible for Swintt to showcase its products in yet another market. The company is determined to continue driving growth in each select jurisdiction it has focused on so far.</p>
