    <h1>Caesars Casino Online Mohegan Sun Pocono Casino Casino Lincoln Ca Stardust Casino Atlantic City Casi</h1>

<p>Leading iGaming aggregation and content brand Pariplay debuted its content in New Jersey thanks to a deal with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino</p>
<p>The NeoGames subsidiary announced the news via its official website and social media accounts. Pariplay continues its streak of high-profile partnerships as it consolidates its presence in the North American market. Cooperating with Caesars is a significant milestone for the developer, as partnering with such a leading gaming company proves the quality and desirability of its products.</p>
<p>Pariplay Has a History of Success</p>
<p>Pariplay enjoyed substantial momentum in 2022, securing partnerships and expanding its market presence with surprising speed. The company’s Fusion content delivery platform has enjoyed immense popularity, growing substantially, thanks to agreements with leading suppliers like Konami, Reloaded Gaming, and Slotmill. Fusion offers over 14,000 games and helpful tools focused on back-office conversion and retention.</p>
<p>A string of high-profile agreements bolstered the developer’s worldwide presence. Pariplay partnered with operators from across the globe, expanding in Europe and the Americas. Canada and the USA remain the company’s primary focus as the content provider continues to look out for opportunities in the dynamic North American market.</p>
<p>The Companies Plan to Extend Their Cooperation</p>
<p>2023 starts with a bang for Pariplay as it enters New Jersey with one of the world’s leading casino and sportsbook operators. The developer’s first batch of content is already live with Caesars venues across the Garden State. Caesars senior VP Matthew Sunderland lauded Pariplay’s offerings, expressing his commitment to providing New Jersey players with a fun and engaging experience.</p>
<p>Pariplay has access to a huge wealth of content… Our players are sure to be engaged and entertained by what’s offered both now and in the future. Matthew Sunderland, Caesars senior VP</p>
<p>Pariplay’s impressive portfolio is available through the successful integration of its Fusion platform. The initial offerings focus on slots games from Wizard Games, Pariplay’s in-house studio, but the developer plans to roll out additional content at a steady pace. NeoGames president Tsachi Maimon acknowledged the partnership as a significant milestone and expressed his desire to maintain a productive relationship with Caesars.</p>
<p>It’s fantastic to have taken the first step in taking our casino products live with Caesars, and we look forward to continuing to work together. Tsachi Maimon, NeoGames president</p>
<p>Solidifying a place among the leading US content suppliers has been a long-time goal for Pariplay. The developer has expended considerable effort towards that objective, but the agreement with Caesars proves its ambitions are attainable. Pariplay’s unique proposition, extensive portfolio of games and solutions, and proven track record have laid the groundwork for a successful and exciting 2023.</p>
