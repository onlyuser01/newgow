<p>Armadillo Studios, the content partner of EveryMatrix established in 2021 which has since produced a range of exceptional games, has confirmed the release of its latest title, Aladdin’s Rollover Respins.</p>
<p>The new game is an exciting slot themed around the fairytale of Aladdin and his magic genie. Aladdin’s Rollover Respins features a standard five-by-three play grid along with 243 payways, and numerous features. This is a high-volatility game, which means that winning combinations will drop less frequently but when they do, they will be big.</p>
<p>The chance to win is bolstered by the availability of numerous features, including Free Spins, Super Symbols, Rollover Respins, and Geni’s Magic Multipliers, each designed to help you have a more enjoyable stay with the title.</p>
<p>Rollover Respins will have a Wild Genie appear on payways with five or more of the same symbols, triggering respins on non-sticky positions. This will lead to more activated symbols and increase the potential winnings up a notch.</p>
<p>There are the Multiple Sticky Symbol Activations that can grant double, triple or even more activated respins, Armadillo Studios outlines in the official release. The Genie’s Magic Multipliers will add further oomph to the experience by triggering – as their name suggests – multipliers increasing the base reward generated from a player’s stake.</p>
<p>Then, you have the all-too-familiar Free Spins that will add even more enjoyment to the game by letting you have some free rounds and a chance to access more of the paylines. The slot also features a few other cool mechanics that will appeal to players, including Buy Bonus to access these opportunities sooner. A Turbo Mode is also available to quicken the pace of gameplay for whoever may be feeling like the game can go a tad faster.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new release, Armadillo Studios COO David Stoveld said that the new release was a testament to the studio’s ability to develop premium games. He argued that everything from the sound design to the gameplay, to the actual incorporation of individual features was designed to be player-focused and easy to get into.</p>
<p>"Experience enchanted nights with Aladdin as we tirelessly strive to bring you more world-class games later this year, working round the clock to surpass industry standards," Stoveld urged players. Meanwhile, Armadillo Studios content is available in Connecticut, West Virginia, Michigan, New Jersey, and very soon, Pennsylvania. Overall, Armadillo Studios' content is available in 20 regulated markets worldwide.</p>
