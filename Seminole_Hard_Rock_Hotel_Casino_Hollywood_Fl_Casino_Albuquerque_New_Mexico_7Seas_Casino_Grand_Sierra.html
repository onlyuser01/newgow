    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Fl Casino Albuquerque New Mexico 7Seas Casino Grand Sierra</h1>

<p>Software developer for the financial services and sports betting industries Amelco announced it entered into a strategic partnership deal with data centre provider Continent 8 Technologies, in a move that will solidify the US presence of the software solutions company.</p>
<p>Amelco is currently operating in 4 US jurisdictions, New Jersey, Indiana, Tennessee and Colorado, and as per local regulatory requirements sports betting operators have to manage and host customer data in-state. The London-listed company received its latest approval, for supplier of sports betting solutions in the Mountain State, in July.</p>
<p>Access to Secure and Reliable Facilities and Networks</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Amelco will utilize Continent 8’s network of data centres to manage its operations and ensure hosting, connectivity and cybersecurity services for its clients in a regulatory compliant way.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to partner with Continent 8, who are unmatched in the industry when it comes to data center services. As we continue to expand across the US, it is vital we have the infrastructure in place to allow us to remain compliant, as well as the facilities to scale up our operations rapidly. We’re confident that Continent 8 is proven to do that better than anyone else out there, and we’re looking forward to working together.” Brandon Walker, Head of Business Development, Amelco</p>
<p>In addition to keeping data from all 4 jurisdictions in-state and separate, the signed agreement will allow the software developer company to have its entire customer base integrated under a single umbrella, as the network of data centres provide premium connectivity and bandwidth resilience, and have the extra capacity to scale across new states.</p>
<p>“Amelco has a reputation as a leading supplier in the industry and we are delighted to be working with them as they expand across the states. Enabling our partners to achieve their goals across regulated states is something we strive to do and Amelco has impressive plans. We look forward to a long and successful partnership together as we support their rapid growth across new jurisdictions.” Nick Nally, Managing Director for the Americas, Continent 8 Technologies</p>
<p>Based out of Isle of Man, Amelco is expanding across regulated US markets by positioning itself as the preferred choice partner for tier one sports book operators such as Flutter Entertainment and Fox Bet, and is actively looking to enter into new jurisdictions as soon as they introduce regulation.</p>
