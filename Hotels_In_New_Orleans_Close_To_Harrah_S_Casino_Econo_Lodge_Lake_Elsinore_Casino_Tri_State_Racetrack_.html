    <h1>Hotels In New Orleans Close To Harrah S Casino Econo Lodge Lake Elsinore Casino Tri State Racetrack</h1>

<p>I think this was AGAIN a good example of the antillephone authorities not reacting to player complaints. I have come across several cases where casinoguru's complaint team has stated that they cannot "help" the player and he should contact the antillephone license authority. Should some kind of change be made to this? For example, that in unclear situations the guru would still try to be helpful and try to solve the problem between the casino and the player?</p>
<p>Alternatively, immediately give black points to the casino if the casino does not cooperate?</p>
<p>Of course, there are many things that are not in the hands of the casino guru, but in the hands of the antillephone authority, and it is sad that this authority does not offer help to the players. Casinoguru must definitely investigate and collect the facts from this authority and in the future warn players not to possibly play in casinos under their license. What if this would help them be more responsive to player complaints?</p>
<p>I would also like to point out the fact that curaco has both antillephone licensed casinos and curaco egaming ceg. antillephone authority is the WORST authority in player complaints.</p>
<p>Curaco's CEG authority handles complaints well. play in casinos licensed by this authority.</p>
