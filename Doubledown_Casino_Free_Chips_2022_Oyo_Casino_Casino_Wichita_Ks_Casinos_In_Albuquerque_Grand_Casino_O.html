    <h1>Doubledown Casino Free Chips 2022 Oyo Casino Casino Wichita Ks Casinos In Albuquerque Grand Casino O</h1>

<p>Sportradar has teamed up with digital out-of-home advertising platform Adomni, forming this new collaboration during the DPAA Summit in New York last week and breaking the news on Wednesday this week via a press release.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, the companies will assist sports betting operators, leagues, and teams to bring more advertising into the digital world through various media channels, and drive engagement with target audiences.</p>
<p>Sportradar will offer its suite of sports data which will then be used by Adomni’s platform to allow brand marketers to create powerful out-of-home campaigns that will use dynamic content such as sports and betting data, the companies explained.</p>
<p>Benefiting from a Large Network of Out-of-Home Ads</p>
<p>Sports advertisers will have access to physical billboards and screens, gyms and restaurants, ride-share vehicles, convenience stores, and other available marketing places in 28 countries across 210 media owners. Sportradar US CEO Arne Rees commented on the partnership and what it brings to the partner companies and consumers:</p>
<p>“As consumer habits shift, it’s important to consider fresh perspectives for advertising and how we can maximize the data and technology that we have at our fingertips to deliver a more engaging experience overall.” Sportradar US CEO Arne Rees</p>
<p>According to Rees digital out-of-home advertising is a powerful way to deliver messages and boost brand awareness. Sportradar is delighted to be teaming up with Adomni, Rees noted and praised the company for its 500,000+ connected screens that would make it simple to deliver powerful sports and sports betting content and messages at scale.</p>
<p>Adomni CEO Jonathan Gudai joined the conversation by praising Sportradar’s rigorous data scraping algorithms that make it possible to generate ad content that is more engaging and actionable. Companies such as Adomni give a leg-up to sports betting giants in both their licensed markets and those that are pending legislation.</p>
<p>Sports Operators Already Taking Advantage of Physical Ads</p>
<p>WynnBet, for example, is using powerful solutions brought by platforms such as Adomni to switch on ads in jurisdictions that have just passed legislation. The company is also capable of planning the right type of advertisement around game time and reflecting the broader sports schedule and betting trends.</p>
<p>The press release cited WynnBet head of paid media Kris Cichoski who said that WynnBet’s ability to rely on Sportradar odds makes it possible for the company to boost its social ad channels and programmatic display ads and lead to new creative and engaging experiences. “This is a game changer,” Cichoski concluded.</p>
