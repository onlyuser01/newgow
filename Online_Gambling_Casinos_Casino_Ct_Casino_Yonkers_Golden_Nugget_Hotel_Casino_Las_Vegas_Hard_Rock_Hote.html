    <h1>Online Gambling Casinos Casino Ct Casino Yonkers Golden Nugget Hotel Casino Las Vegas Hard Rock Hote</h1>

<p>Octoplay has been building up its presence globally and adding to its team generously, plucking top talent from the industry’s high decks unabashedly. The cutting-edge studio and developer of online casino content now has another reason to boast, as the company secured the talents of Gavin Hamilton as its new Chairman, still pending regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Hamilton, who is a Red Tiger veteran, brings significant experience to the company, having served in the industry and various roles over his career. He is now returning to the B2B vertical, determined to help elevate Octoplay’s product offering and reach by using his skillset and knowledge of the industry and how to navigate its challenging waters.</p>
<p>With a firm hand on the company’s direction, he will be working closely with Octoplay CEO Carl Ejlertsson, and together, the pair will seek to establish the company as an even more recognizable name in the iGaming industry in 2024. "Octoplay is poised for a pivotal year," Ejlertsson predicts.</p>
<p>Hamilton has welcomed the opportunity to join the company as its Chairman and said that he was happy to be part of its journey which has demonstrated how an up-and-coming studio may break ground in relevant markets, secure pivotal partnerships, and become a household name in the industry despite the high entry threshold.</p>
<p>"For Octoplay to have already secured partnerships with most of the world's largest operators is a significant endorsement of their commitment to product excellence and innovation," Hamilton added. Both Ejlertsson and Hamilton are confident about the company’s future.</p>
<p>Octoplay was only founded in October 2022, and it has been quickly moving forward in strides, securing vast swathes of iGaming markets, and signing important and recognizable operator names.</p>
<p>Octoplay has signed several recent partnerships, with the company notably entering the iGaming market in Ontario. The supplier also launched an Eastward-bound assault in Romania where the company has been authorized to provide its products to licensed operators under a B2B license. Not least, Octoplay gained even more ground and gathered momentum through its tie-up with Betfair and Paddy Power.</p>
