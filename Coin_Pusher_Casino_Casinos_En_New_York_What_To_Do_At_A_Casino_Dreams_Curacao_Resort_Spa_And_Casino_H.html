    <h1>Coin Pusher Casino Casinos En New York What To Do At A Casino Dreams Curacao Resort Spa And Casino H</h1>

<p>The company is bringing the powerful innovative mechanic to one of its top-performing games of all times</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC’s Gaming and Entertainment division has welcomed the opportunity to enhance the classic Book of Ra Deluxe game with the addition of the highly-esteemed Win Ways mechanic which allows for more paylines to be added to the reels.</p>
<p>The Popular Franchise Gets a Powerful Feature Boost</p>
<p>In a way, Win Ways resembles the Megaways mechanic but with its own twist, of course. Thanks to the addition of the Win Ways feature into Book of Ra Deluxe, the game will now come with up to six reels and 117,648 paylines.</p>
<p>The feature adds an extra reel above the main game grid, and winning symbols on that new reel will trigger a trickle-down effect translating into payouts for players across the board. If players get bonus scatter symbols on the reels, they will be awarded 10 free spins that are granted instantly and trigger the bonus round immediately.</p>
<p>Each new bonus symbol that comes across the reels will trigger additional five spins. The bonus level will also feature a special expanding symbol that is selected at random and helps the players along. This symbol can then add more heft to every spin and boost your winnings even more.</p>
<p>Players to Benefit from the Win Ways Mechanic Big Time</p>
<p>Greentube director of games development and operations Steve Cross has welcomed the opportunity to add the unique mechanic to the esteemed franchise. He noted that Book of Ra is one of the best-performing series in iGaming and incorporating the Win Ways mechanic into it is another step forward.</p>
<p>“The team did a great job on this title, and we can’t wait for players to get their hands on it,” Cross assured. All the while, Greentube has been looking to actively expand its presence in regulated iGaming markets.</p>
<p>The supplier has signed partnerships with StarGames.de in Germany and TonyBet in Latvia, both important markets in Europe. Greentube has also secured a supplier license in Connecticut and is looking to expand its clout in North America.</p>
