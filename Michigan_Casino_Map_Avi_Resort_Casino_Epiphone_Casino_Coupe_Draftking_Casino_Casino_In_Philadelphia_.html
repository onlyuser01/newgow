<p>Candy Island Princess review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This game has a Japanese game show theme.</p>
<p>After arriving on a tropical island, players will meet a selection of bodacious anime girls. Each one is a contestant in the Candy Island Princess competition, and none are too shy about showing off their assets.</p>
<p>This slot is filled with pastel colours, adorable candies, and flirtatious winks. This is a great game for players looking for a sugary fantasy, with a saucy dose of sexy appeal.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a cheerful pop tune that brings to mind a dance party. The reels spin with a cute bubbling sound, and wins are celebrated with the jiggle of coins.</p>
<p>The Princess contestants each have a signature look and personality. With flower-adorned hair in colours including blond, violet and brunette, they are easy to identify.</p>
<p>At first, only the contestants’ cutesy faces can be seen on the reels. However, the visual expands to show the girls’ scantily bikini-clad bodies. The animation style makes no secret of the girls’ curves, showing off a scandalous full body image.</p>
<p>Despite the sexy looks, the girls also have a wholesome sweetness as they hold beach accessories and smile innocently. This feels right on brand for the anime aesthetic.</p>
<p>Also among the symbols are hard candies in pastel hues and friendly shapes, including hearts and flowers. A camera and film also appear on the reels, highlighting beach model competition at hand.</p>
<p>Overall, the music and animation combine to create a balance of sweet and sassy moods.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Candy Island Princess is a three reel, three row slot with five win lines.</p>
<p>The gameplay is fast and players will not have trouble staying engaged.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Players may mix-and-match the contestant symbols in order to complete a payline.</p>
<p>If players land a matching set of 3 contestant symbols, the symbols will fully expand.</p>
<p>Players will trigger the Free Spins feature when they land 3 Ticket symbols. If players land 2 Ticket symbols, they will be awarded a Lucky Re-Spin of the reel missing a Ticket symbol. This will give players another chance to win the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>The Jelly Jiggle Delight feature is triggered during every Free Spins feature. Players will have the option to choose 1 of 3 jelly desserts which provide the chance to win a x2 multiplier. This can double the winnings from the entire Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>If players land 3 Camera symbols, this triggers the Behind the Scenes feature. Players will instantly be awarded wins between x5 and x200 their bet.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.2%, slightly above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.05 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low-medium, which makes it a relatively poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this relatively high RTP, low-medium volatility anime-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though the flirtatious aesthetics are fun, the game simply cannot overcome its mediocre strategy profile.</p>
<p>Players looking to maximise their big wins would do better to seek out a game that offers higher volatility.</p>
