<p>The winning total was $2,835,768, the Las Vegas Strip casino revealed in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>The Venetian did not identify the winner. Nor did it release on which day the money was won.</p>
<p>The player hit the jackpot by matching three explosion symbols. It was on the Fu Babies bonus on the Dancing Drums Explosion slot machine.</p>
<p>The machine is made by SG Gaming. It has an Asian theme.</p>
<p>Other Vegas Winners Last Week</p>
<p>Other Las Vegas casinos also reported recent jackpots. For example, a woman won $717,738.88 on a slot at the Fremont Hotel and Casino on Friday.</p>
<p>She placed a $15 bet. It was her first spin, KLAS, a local TV station, reported. The total was received from a Grand Progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>The winner lives in Hawaii. Her name was not released by the casino. The casino is located in downtown Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In another downtown casino, the Circa, $105,862.50 was won last week. The jackpot was hit while playing an All Aboard Gold Express slot machine.</p>
<p>The win was announced on Friday on the casino’s Twitter feed. No word on who the lucky winner is.</p>
<p>Prior Venetian Jackpots</p>
<p>The Venetian has seen other jackpot winners in recent months. For instance, in July, the gaming property was the site of a payout of over $1 million. It was from a $5 side bet on a Three Card Poker game.</p>
<p>The player was dealt a spade royal flush, according to a casino statement. The side bet made them eligible for the mega tier of The Venetian’s Millionaire Progressive. It paid out $1,040,235.</p>
<p>The winner chose not to release his/her name.</p>
<p>As of July, in total, 10 players won more than $1 million since the Progressive started at The Venetian.</p>
<p>It was in 2018, when The Venetian began the Progressive, which begins at $1 million.</p>
<p>A player is eligible for the mega tier of the Millionaire Progressive after making the $5 side bet. To win, the player must be dealt a natural spade royal flush.</p>
<p>Beyond Three Card Poker, the Progressive is available on Ultimate Texas Hold’em, Let it Ride, Crazy 4 Poker, and Mississippi Stud at The Venetian and The Palazzo casinos.</p>
<p>Wheel of Fortune Win</p>
<p>Also at The Venetian last December, a player won $1,022,077.71 on the Wheel of Fortune game on a slot machine. The lucky guest made a $2 bet on the Wheel of Fortune Double 3X4X5X Pay game on Dec. 3, 2021. The three symbols lined up to activate the Progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>The game is made by International Game Technology. As of January, Wheel of Fortune slots created more than 1,100 millionaires and awarded more than $3.3 billion in jackpots since 1996.</p>
