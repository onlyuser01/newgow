    <h1>Fond Du Luth Casino Drake Casino Login How Many Casinos Are In Atlantic City Nearest Casino Casino N</h1>

<p>Rich Wilde’s daughter Cat is back and ready to explore some pyramids in search of treasures in Play’n GO’s latest release, Cat Wilde and the Pyramids of Dead. The fearless explorer is done collecting passport stamps, looking for missing pages in the Lost Chapter, walking through dense jungles in Eclipse of the Sun God and exploring Egyptian territory in Doom of Dead. Cat is now ready to enter the forbidden tombs in the new “Dead Series” slot. The game features unique twists like Fixed Jackpots, free Spins, and Instant Prizes.</p>

<p>Game Design &amp; Symbols</p>
<p>The slot has a design that fans of the series will immediately recognize, with a strong focus on the Pyramids of Dead located in a part of Egypt. The game features a 5×3 grid at the center of a temple packed with hieroglyphics, ancient columns, and pot plants. With birds slowly drifting by in the enigmatic scenery, Cat Wilde and the Pyramids of Dead do a good job continuing the renowned series in terms of imagery and sounds.</p>
<p>Cat Wilde is set to find some unique treasures hidden in tombs no one is allowed to enter, putting herself at risk while aiming for the big wins. Players can also score winning combinations across the ten available paylines when finding identical symbols, from right to left starting with the first reel. To score a win, a player must land a minimum of three low-paying symbols (cards ranging from 10 to A) or two high-paying symbols (Pharaoh, scarab, Anubis, Cat). Low paying symbols represent six to eight times the stake for five matching symbols. This automatically gives players a 40x to 1,000x boost on their bets.</p>
<p>Fresh Twists to the Popular Series</p>
<p>The new game has three brand new bonus features that were not part of the previous games: Free Spins, Instant Prize, and Fixed Jackpots.</p>
<p>Free Spins</p>
<p>Players who trigger this feature receive eight free spins with an initial pay symbol selected randomly to play the role of a special expanding symbol. Provided this special symbol forms a win, it automatically expands and covers all of its positions on the reel, paying all lines. It is possible to retrigger this feature to get more free spins and an additional pay symbol that will turn into a similar expanding symbol.</p>
<p>Instant Prize Feature</p>
<p>All scatters on the grid will have their value in coins added up and given to players, for as much as 500x the initial bet.</p>
<p>Jackpot Round</p>
<p>During this round, twelve antique pottery items will pop on the screen, with four jackpots on top. Clicking the pots will reveal a jackpot. Revealing three jackpots of a kind will reward players with a 20x prize (Khufu), a 100x prize (Tiye), a 250x prize (Tutankhamun), or a 1,000x prize (Mereneith).</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s head of games Charlotte Miliziano called the Dead series games and Cat and Rich Wilde characters “powerful”. She also emphasized the newly born chance to explore fresh avenues for the beloved characters, making them grow while bringing innovative game features “to keep players coming back” for more exciting content.</p>
<p>The new slot follows the release of Rocco Gallo, an animal-themed game with instant prizes, and Idol of Fortune, a game with a South-Asian theme.</p>
