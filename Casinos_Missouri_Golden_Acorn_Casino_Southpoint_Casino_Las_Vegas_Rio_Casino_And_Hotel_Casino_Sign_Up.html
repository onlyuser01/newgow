<p>Dear Paclmaya and Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for taking the time to post your feedback about LevelUp Casino.</p>
<p>Every comment that we receive is highly appreciated as it helps us have a better understanding of the problems players face, so that we may take action and prevent those problematic issues from reoccurring.</p>
<p>Our team would like to shed the light on the situation that occurred and give you more details about this case.</p>
<p>Firstly, we are deeply sorry for the delay in the processing of the deposit that the player has faced. In reality, such situations are rare, and, usually, there are no problems with timely crediting of payments. However, we have gathered the necessary information in order to transfer this case to the payment provider for investigation and did our best to solve this issue. As soon as we got an answer, the player was informed via email, and the funds were credited to the player’s balance. Due to the involvement of a third party, namely payment to the provider which processes the transaction, unfortunately, we cannot directly influence the rapidness of the resolving of the issue.</p>
<p>Secondly, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that the conditions of the special offer were mentioned in the email that you received from us. It was our promo of 200% that means 100% deposit and 100% bonus. Moreover, you were informed via chat about them before issuing. As it was advertised, you received 50 EUR (100% deposit) and 50 EUR (100% bonus) so the balance was 100 EUR in total. If the bonus conditions don’t meet the player’s expectation, he/she is free to cancel the bonus.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some providers may be restricted to certain countries. Nevertheless, we want to tell you that there are still lots of top providers to chose from, and we are constantly making this variety even bigger. If you have some problems or need assistance with any question, our support team works round the clock to provide help any time of the day.</p>
<p>We appreciate your public statement and be sure that our team looks into the details of every case carefully to assure that any issue is solved shortly and flawlessly.</p>
<p>We wholeheartedly hope for understanding and wishing you success and good luck!</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>LevelUp Casino team</p>
