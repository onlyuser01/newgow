<p>Betway has confirmed its expansion in Portugal, which will see the prominent brand and operator deliver its flagship iGaming and sportsbook platform powered by Gaming Innovation Group’s (GiG) solutions. This enables both companies to achieve the best possible starting conditions for their further expansion into the regulated market, with GiG welcoming of the opportunity.</p>
<p>GiG is happy to introduce its offer to a second B2B brand locally and ensure that the company continues to secure ground in some of Europe’s leading markets. GiG offers a full suite of solutions that are developed to specifically address growing consumer demands as well as tighter regulatory mandates that result in strong revenue growth.</p>
<p>Portugal is generally touted as a heavily regulated market that usually presents challenges to new brands. GiG and Betway, however, do not seem to think so, as the company and its brand are confident in their long-term success locally, leveraging powerful features that are designed to give the platform a competitive edge.</p>
<p>GiG Chief Business Officer Andrew Cochrane has welcomed this opportunity equally excited, arguing that it was indicative of the company’s commitment to establishing itself as a leading force in the B2B industry, something that was reaffirmed through the launch with the tier-one brand:</p>
<p>"This is a very exciting time to be a part of GiG, as we continue to invest in our product and technology capabilities to underpin further Tier 1 client wins and provide existing clients with ever more compelling product features."</p>
<p>Betway CEO Anthony Werkman was similarly pleased with the development and welcomed the chance to see his company grow in yet another regulated market in 2024.</p>
<p>Portugal is an important regional opportunity for the company, Werkman explained, and the GiG platform will help play a crucial role in the brand’s success as it seeks to build strong ties with local players.</p>
<p>"This agreement will also allow our teams to work in synergy to reach our shared goals and aspirations within the country," the executive noted. GiG has been actively developing its business capabilities, with the company recently finalizing the acquisition of KaFe Rocks, an affiliate company.</p>
