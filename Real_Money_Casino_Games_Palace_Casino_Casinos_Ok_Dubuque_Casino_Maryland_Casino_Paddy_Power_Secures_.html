    <h1>Real Money Casino Games Palace Casino Casinos Ok Dubuque Casino Maryland Casino Paddy Power Secures</h1>

<p>Paddy Power has received the prestigious “Superbrand” status from the Center of Brand Analysis for its high-impact campaigns</p>
<p>The gambling company with online and retail operations spread across Ireland and the UK has been recognized as a superior and creatively engaged brand in the British gaming market. The brand known as “Home of the Money Back Special” has received the yearly accolade from the center that does independent consumer surveys to determine which are the most outstanding brands in a certain marketplace.</p>
<p>The Brand Is Praised for Its Campaigns</p>
<p>The central brand within Flutter’s Irish and English divisions has been applauded for its work toward reaching and engaging with a wider public, way beyond its marketing boundaries. Using their social media pages, Paddy Power explained that the “Superbrand” status is “awarded to brands for quality, reliability, and distinction.”</p>
<p>Last Christmas, the company that specializes in casino games, sports betting, poker, and bingo was the host of a live opera show. The event was organized and hosted together with former professional striker Peter Crouch and Welsh-residing tenor who won the first series of ITV’s Britain’s Got Talent Paul Potts. The live opera event was organized in support of an orchestra recording “Crouchy Conducts The Classics.”</p>
<p>The album was later on released on the most popular online streaming platforms, taking down Andrea Bocelli from the second position in the Classical Album charts during the same week. It also retained a prestigious position in the Top 10 for 14 days.</p>
<p>The campaign’s profits were fully donated to Stonewall, a charity supporting the LGBT+ community. The money was intended to support the charity’s work in Qatar. Potts, Crouch, and “The Paddy Power Choir” also performed at a gig organized at the Wembley Arena. All tickets were sold out.</p>
<p>What Does the Superbrand Status Mean for Paddy Power?</p>
<p>The company is now on the “invite only” list for the Superbrand 2022/2023 publication, proving the success of its marketing campaigns and work amongst some of the most popular and easily-recognizable brands in the UK.</p>
<p>Paddy Power’s spokesperson Rachael Kane spoke about the excitement they felt at the news they had received the “Superbrand” status. Kane acknowledged the independent council made of industry pros that had to browse through large volumes of customer support data to reach the conclusion that Paddy Power should be granted the status. The spokesperson also called their customers’ contribution in being awarded the title a “supreme badge of honor”.</p>
<p>The brand that called itself “OFFICIALLY the best of the best” sealed a deal with a B2B supplier, provider of gaming technology, content, services, and hardware Inspired Entertainment in December. As part of the agreement, Paddy Power agreed to procure around 1,400 Vantage server-based gaming-ready cabinets by the end of the current year.</p>
