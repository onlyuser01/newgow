    <h1>Bitcoin Casinos Doubleu Casino Facebook Best Usa Bitcoin Casino No Deposit Bonus 888 Casino Review H</h1>

<p>My problem with them is they claim to only accept Bitcoin or MoneyGram or Western Union. When I questioned them in chat as to why these are the only deposit methods, I was told I am on a "global blacklist" and that's why they are the only deposit methods. When I stated that only scammers want Western Union and MoneyGram and the like, the person abruptly closed the chat. Just as well, and I closed my account and asked the chat person to delete any of my personal information from their files. I am very glad that I never managed to make a deposit, and I will never deal with this bingo billy again. My advice is that anyone interested in bingo billy should turn around and run in the opposite direction. This company is extremely suspicious and I fairly sure they would have no trouble taking your money with no benefit to you.</p>
