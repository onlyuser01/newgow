<p>Game 2 Predictions: Barca vs Liverpool – Messi Unstoppable</p>
<p>A lot of uncertainty surrounds the second leg of the UEFA Champions League. With both Tottenham and Liverpool suffering defeats the idea of seeing a EPL Final in UCL is implausible.</p>
<p>“Liverpool needs a miracle to knock out Messi and Barcelona.”</p>
<p>Liverpool aren’t out yet, but they will need to pull a 3-0 to even catch up to Barcelona at home turf at Ainfield, which isn’t going to be easy. Even before Game 1, analysts commented that for Liverpool to succeed, they would need to take up responsibility and counter Messi, as the game’s rhythm dictated.</p>
<p>Liverpool fell short of the task at hand but they rose to the occasion in the interim game at home against Newcastle.</p>
<p>Is Lionel Messi unstoppable? This is one accurate way to put it. ESPN UK’s analysts predicted that Liverpool “needs a miracle to knock out Messi and Barcelona”</p>
<p>Firmino and Dembele Out for Game 2</p>
<p>Roberto Firmino had to miss the opening game, leaving Liverpool at the mercy of Barcelona. He won’t be coming back in Game 2 on Tuesday either. It is never a good thing when players miss out because of an injury, but Liverpool will not be the only ones missing on players.</p>

<p>If there is one serious challenge Liverpool face that is whether Mohamed Salah will be able to play on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Egyptian got injured during the game versus Newcastle in which Liverpool were pushing for an EPL victory, and even though their chances of securing the title are slim, Salah’s commitment was outstanding.</p>
<p>Date/Time: Wednesday, May 7, 2019, 3:00 PM EST</p>
<p>Wednesday, May 7, 2019, 3:00 PM EST Venue: Ainfield, London</p>
