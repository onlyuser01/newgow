<p>If you’re wondering why the clash between Arman Tsarukyan and Mateusz Gamrot is headlining the UFC on ESPN 38 event, it’s because these two really know how to put on a show in the octagon. Tsarukyan won the Performance of the Night bonus in his two previous fights. Gamrot did it in two of his previous three bouts.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s clear that Tsarukyan vs. Gamrot is supposed to be a real barnburner. But which fighter will be crowned the winner? That’s the question we’ll try to answer in our UFC on ESPN 38 preview.</p>

<p>Oddsmakers Favor Tsarukyan to Win on Saturday</p>
<p>Tsarukyan is 18-2 in his professional career, with a 5-1 record in the UFC. His promotional debut started with a loss to Islam Makhachev. Tsarukyan lost by decision, but the fight was crowned the Fight of the Night by UFC officials.</p>
<p>Did he bounce back after the loss? Sure, he did. After the defeat, Tsarukyan went on to win the next five fights. The first three he won, he did it by unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Then, he won another two fights – against Christos Giagos and Joel Alvarez – by technical knockout (punches). For those two TKO wins, he got himself the Performance of the Night bonus by the UFC.</p>
<p>Former KSW Champ Dreaming Big</p>
<p>Before moving to the UFC, Mateusz Gamrot used to hold KSW titles in two weight classes. In October 2020, he made his UFC debut which wasn’t very successful. He lost his first UFC fight to Guram Kuteladze by split decision. Their bout has crowned the Fight of the Night of the event.</p>
<p>From there, he went on to win the next three fights, finishing each of those in under three rounds. Further, we saw him win the Performance of the Night bonus two times along the way.</p>
<p>Tsarukyan vs. Gamrot Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction for Tsarukyan vs. Gamrot is that this is going to be a very entertaining fight. These guys love to fight and have the stamina needed to stay on their feet for all five rounds. That said, it’s very likely the fight-winner will be determined by the judges. So, the big question is who is it going to be? Although anything can happen in a fight like this, our vote goes to Tsarukyan.</p>
<p>Pick: Arman Tsarukyan by decision</p>
