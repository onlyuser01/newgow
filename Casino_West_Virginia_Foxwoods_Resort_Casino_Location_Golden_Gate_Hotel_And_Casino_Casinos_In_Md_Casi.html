<p>Bethereum has just won the CESAwards Grand Finale and is now heading for the Global Startup Awards (GSA) in Changsha, China on December 11 – 14.</p>
<p>Social Sports Betting Platform Bethereum Wins CESAwards Grand Finale</p>
<p>Bethereum has been awarded the Best Blockchain Startup of 2019 at the CESAwards Grand Finale, adding a yet another distinction to its list of achievements this year. Driven by community and offering a transparent platform, Bethereum has successfully built a core of loyalist around its offer.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Bethereum is now looking forward to the next challenge – this time for a shot at the Global Startup Awards (GSA) Grand Finale, being one of the seven companies worldwide admitted in the contest after a series of local qualifiers.</p>
<p>The event will take place in Changsha, China on December 11 through December 14, 2019.</p>
<p>Why Does the GSA Matter?</p>
<p>As one of the largest startup ecosystems in the world, a GSA distinction would help Bethereum to continue and develop its profile, remainining synonymous to innovation, specifically in the iGaming and sports betting sectors.</p>
<p>Bethereum faced a stiff competition of almost 5,500 entrants, looking to gain admittance into the finals. Apart from qualifying for the Grand Finale, Bethereum previously had to win the European Startup Awards (CESAwards) – both national and regional qualifications – to be considered.</p>
<p>No small apart of its success has been attributed to the active community the company has built around itself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the platform has been preparing for a full-scale launch hoping to establish the Bether token as a viable alternative to FIAT currency for sports betting.</p>
<p>Naturally, Bethereum is not the only company vying for the opportunity to be a ground-breaking entity in the segment.</p>
<p>Apart from adding a new distinction to its name, Bethereum has also found the time to post a new update on Friday, November 22, introducing 1×2 bets for its esports offer as well as over/under bets for maps and rounds in the same segment.</p>
<p>Bethereum Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the platform’s strengths have lied in its pursuit of transparency, allowing players to engage with the creators openly.</p>
<p>Not least of all, Bethereum has been very upfront about its future and whether certain goals are feasible, thanks to the AMA sessions developers and executives have been holding regularly via their Medium blog.</p>
<p>Bethereum already has a rather strong base of followers, making it theoretically possible for them to launch.</p>
<p>However, CEO Giacomo Tognoni has argued that the team is against proceeding with a launch without a proper license for example, which – at the time of the last AMA – was close to happening.</p>
