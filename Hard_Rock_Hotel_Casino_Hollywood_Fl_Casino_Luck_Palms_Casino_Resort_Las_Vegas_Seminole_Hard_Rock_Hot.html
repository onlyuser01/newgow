    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Fl Casino Luck Palms Casino Resort Las Vegas Seminole Hard Rock Hot</h1>

<p>Ahead of its upcoming opening set for the end of the year, Fontainebleau Las Vegas strengthened its team via a promotion and two new senior-level appointments</p>
<p>The luxury hotel and casino that is currently under construction on the Las Vegas Strip, Fontainebleau Las Vegas, announced multiple senior-level appointments Monday. The latest appointments come ahead of the resort’s planned opening set for December this year and seek to further strengthen the venue’s team of experts by bringing seasoned veterans with extensive experience.</p>
<p>As a result, Fontainebleau Las Vegas added Mark Tricano and Michelle Reda to its growing leadership team. At the same time, the venue confirmed that it promoted Kimberly Virtuoso. As an industry expert with more than two decades of experience within the hospitality, entertainment and gaming vertical, Tricano was appointed to the role of president of the resort.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Reda, who also brings extensive knowledge and experience within the sector was named as Fontainebleau Las Vegas’ new chief casino marketing officer. Last but not least, Virtuoso, who initially joined the resort back in 2022, was promoted to the role of senior vice president of people.</p>
<p>The Trio Bring Extensive Experience and Knowledge</p>
<p>Virtuoso’s recent promotion comes as no surprise, considering her dedication since she first became a part of the resort’s growing team in 2022 as vice president of people. She contributed toward the launch of the resort’s online recruitment portal that will help expand Fontainebleau Las Vegas’ team exponentially.</p>
<p>At the same time, Virtuoso was in charge of the resort’s human resources strategy. She brings significant experience as an HR expert and has previously served as MGM Resorts International’s executive director of corporate human resources.</p>
<p>Similarly, Reda holds a wide range of knowledge and insight after being a part of the luxury hospitality and casino marketing vertical for more than two decades. She served at high-profile resorts in Las Vegas, which enabled her to accumulate significant knowledge within the sector.</p>
<p>Reda has a track record within the hospitality and gaming vertical and she was recently a part of Wynn Resorts. Overall, her career with the globally recognized company lasted for 13 years and during that time, she held different senior-level roles. In addition to Wynn Resorts, Reda was also a part of Caesars Entertainment as well as Station Casinos.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Fontainebleau Las Vegas’ new president, Tricano, takes over the role from Brett Mufson, who held it provisionally. Tricano has an extensive background in the hospitality, gaming and financial verticals. Undoubtedly, this extensive experience will help him in the role of president at the resort. Before joining Fontainebleau Las Vegas, Tricano served in domestic and international companies, including Caesars Entertainment, Station Casinos, Galaxy Entertainment Group and Jack Entertainment, among others.</p>
