<p>The 2022 EuroBasket has the potential to turn into one of the most exciting sports events of the year. The reason is that the tournament is packed with NBA superstars playing for several different countries. One of those countries is France, whose center Rudy Gobert is the reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s no surprise France is seen as one of the top 4 favorites for the title, priced at +400 at most basketball betting sites. The odds are even shorter when it comes to betting on the Group B winner betting – France is priced at +180.</p>
<p>Germany, on the other hand, isn’t given good chance. However, these guys play at home, in front of their audience. With the support from the stands, maybe they could cause a couple of surprises.</p>

<p>The French Planning a Flying Start to the 2022 EuroBasket</p>
<p>The France national basketball team lost just one game in 2022. It happened in the World Cup qualifications against Montenegro who beat them by just one point. In that game, France was without several of its biggest stars, including new Minnesota Timberwolves player Rudy Gobert. Even without their key men, they still managed to give Montenegro players a run for their money.</p>
<p>It’s been a whole different story when the French are playing with their best players on the roster. Last Wednesday, for example, they played a World Cup qualifier against the Czech Republic and won 95-60.</p>
<p>Rudy Gober was on the court, along with other Frenchy superstars – Evan Fournier (New York Knicks), Thomas Heurtel (Real Madrid), Guerschon Yabusele (Real Madrid), Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (Atlanta Hawks), and others.</p>
<p>How Good is Germany at Basketball?</p>
<p>Oddsmakers don’t have faith in the German national basketball team. They see the Germans as +1200 underdogs for the title, which is understandable knowing that the 2022 EuroBasket is incredibly competitive.</p>
<p>However, knowing that two German cities are going to host most of the EuroBasket games, these guys might stand a chance to get far. Cologne is the place where several matches of the group phase will be played, including France vs Germany game. Berlin is the place where all games of the knockout stage will take place.</p>
<p>Germany will have fans on their side, but the question is can they turn their players into world-winners? Well, the German roster definitely isn’t the best in Europe, but there are some pretty decent players on this team. Dennis Schröder (Houston Rockets) is probably their most famous player, while Johannes Voigtmann (CSKA Moscow) is a big name in Europe.</p>
<p>Then, there are several players from Bayern Munich and Alba Berlin, teams that play in the EuroLeague. That said, this team is probably much stronger than what most basketball fans think. Still, we don’t think they’re strong enough to beat France in the first round of the EuroBasket.</p>
<p>France vs Germany EuroBasket Prediction</p>
<p>France is winning this game, but it’s not going to be a field day for them. Germans are going to fight back but they probably aren’t going to score too many points. France will score more, but probably not more than 100.</p>
