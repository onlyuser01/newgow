    <h1>Treasure Island Hotel And Casino Photos Century Casino Hotel Cripple Creek Cripple Creek Co Tunica M</h1>

<p>Las Vegas’ Silverton hotel and casino recently announced that it would celebrate its 25th birthday by completely remodeling its rooms and swimming pool. The resort aims to create a new boutique experience for its future guests. The hotel and pool will close in August and reopen sometime in 2023. The rest of the resort and the casino will remain open to guests.</p>
<p>The Brand Drew Inspiration from Previous Successes</p>
<p>Silverton officials explained they drew inspiration from Hotel Drover, the company’s sister property which received wide acclaim. Since it opened in 2021, Hotel Drover has received high praise from several high-profile media outlets for its chic western glam design and attention to detail.</p>
<p>The Reimagined Silverton will provide its guests with a Western-style “rustic-luxe” experience. The 300 guest rooms and suites will be divided into three distinct styles, each telling its unique “design story” with a defined style, decor, and atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Cowboy Kitsch Collection will add tasteful modern touches to rustic decor. The Rustic Modern Collection will aim to capture the natural warmth of the outdoors with aged and weathered furnishings. Finally, the Livin’ Lodge Collection rooms draw inspiration from famous Western cattle baron homes.</p>
<p>The Project Is in Trustworthy Hands</p>
<p>Kayla Wilkie, director of Design and Development for Lifestyle and Hospitality for Majestic Realty Co., will head the $45 million renovation project. The company is a trusted affiliate of Silverton and Wilkie led the design team behind Hotel Drover’s success.</p>
<p>Craig Cavileer, Silverton’s CEO, lauded Wilkie’s expertise and past success and expressed hope that the new project would be just as successful. He noted that the project was more than just a room remodeling and would completely reinvent the company’s Las Vegas Hotel operation.</p>
<p>“Our new rooms and suites will envelop our guests in a new spirit of rustic elegance, providing a unique Las Vegas hotel experience.” Craig Cavileer, CEO of Silverton</p>
<p>The renovation will affect the hotel and the adjacent Sway pool deck. However, guests will still be able to enjoy the rest of the resort. Visitors will retain full access to the restaurants, casino, aquarium, and shops. The other two hotels in the Silverton Village district – The Hyatt Place Las Vegas and The Berkley will also stay open.</p>
<p>Silverton opened its doors in 1994 under the name Boomtown Las Vegas. The casino adopted its current name in 1997 and has become a staple on the Strip. The management team hopes that the redesign will help attract a new audience in addition to its current regulars. The brand also plans to open its new Silverton Ranch Casino about an hour north of the Las Vegas Strip in Pahrump, Nevada. The project was initially slated to start in 2019 but faced several delays. Construction will finally begin later in the year.</p>
