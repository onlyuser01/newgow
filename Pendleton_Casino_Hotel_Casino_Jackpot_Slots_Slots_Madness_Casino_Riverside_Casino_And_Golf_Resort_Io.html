    <h1>Pendleton Casino Hotel Casino Jackpot Slots Slots Madness Casino Riverside Casino And Golf Resort Io</h1>

<p>I just confiscated $ 500. Until then, I applied for withdrawal and had been back for 5 business days. This is the second withdrawal. I think it was quite a while ago last year that I received a deposit-free bonus and cleared the conditions. I was reluctant to talk to support because it was in English, so I couldn't withdraw the bonus of $ 100. I made about $ 750, but the terms and conditions stated that it was $ 100, so I asked support to withdraw for the time being. Then I was told that I needed to make one deposit, so I made a deposit once, applied for a bonus withdrawal, and then enjoyed the slot with a cashback bonus of $ 10. I was told by support that I needed to submit an identity verification document, but I had submitted the identity verification document before I registered, but since I had been standing for about half a year, I submitted the identity verification document again. He said he wouldn't ask support if there were any other documents needed because the withdrawal hadn't been processed in two days. Withdrawal was ecoPayz. I was told that it would take up to 5 business days, so I was waiting. About 7 days later, I received an e-mail saying that the withdrawal was verified, and ecoPayz also received the deposit properly. After that, I made a deposit, so I finished playing and had $ 650 left, so I applied for a second withdrawal of $ 500. It was also said that it would take 5 business days. However, I happened to rely on the money because the electric company I use at my house went bankrupt and I couldn't get a bill for two months at a stretch. I told the support people that I was in a hurry many times, but as soon as the days passed and the examination was over, I was told that I would receive an email and that ecoPayz would also be credited. Even so, the deadline for paying the electricity bill was gradually approaching, and I asked if I could withdraw money many times as soon as possible, but it was only 5 business days. The day before yesterday has finally passed and I am anxious and sick. I contacted support many times, but I was told to wait without worry until the examination was completed. As a result of waiting for 6 days, the withdrawal was refused. I received an email from the payment team saying that the reason was that I didn't submit the screenshot of the ecoPayz account. I wasn't charged the first time, but I was charged the second time, and the payment team told me to apply for withdrawal as soon as I submitted it, so I emailed a screenshot of my ecoPayz account and I refused $ 500. I applied for withdrawal again. When I asked support if I would like to deposit the documents to ecoPayz immediately after submitting the documents, I was told again that it would take 5 business days because I renewed my withdrawal application. I didn't understand why it would take so long even though I had reviewed it once, and I told the supporters that I had to pay the electricity bill all the time, but after 5 days, I received an email from the payment team, so I'm relieved. They said. Before that, I was told that I had visited the documents for support at the time of the first withdrawal of ecoPayz, much less the same withdrawal method, if I submit it before the examination is completed. Submit documents to me. Do I have to tell you? But he said he didn't know the support. I also sent an email because I thought I had to wait 5 days in vain because of a mistake on the casino side instead of me, but the email from the payment team did not reply until I finally urged by email. I sent an ecoPayz Account screenshot the day before, but when I sent a reminder email in the evening, I was told that it would take 24-48 hours to check the documents, and I couldn't understand the reason. From there, I contacted the support staff and asked why I had to wait 5 business days even though I made a mistake, but I only said that it would take 5 business days, excluding the first day. I thought it would be useless to talk to the support and payment teams because it would really stop if I didn't pay the electricity bill early, so I said I would like to talk to the casino boss. Support was all about emailing the payment team. Normally, the withdrawal was processed the day before and reflected in ecoPayz, but if you want to have a quick response, talk to your boss and ask the settlement team to process the withdrawal faster. I thought that was the fastest and told support. However, support was all about emailing the payment team and having to wait 5 business days. I called richcasino today, but I hung up because I had no idea what the English guidance was saying. After that, I called support but told him I didn't understand English. Please wait with peace of mind from there, and it will not try to speed up the withdrawal just by saying. After all, I thought that I should contact the management company somehow, so I said it to support and googled, but I did not understand at all. It's just a while ago. It would be sudden if I had been talking to my boss about making complaints, right? The payment team also said that the reason for the refusal was the screenshot of the ecoPayz account, but support said that I was trying to withdraw because it was from a bonus, so I confiscated it, and it made no sense. When I went to my account, I really lost $ 500. I thought I wouldn't have to stop paying for my electricity, but suddenly I didn't say a bonus. I don't know why I sent the ecoPayz screenshot, and I don't know why I was told to wait 5 business days. The electricity stopped and my head was full. I was playing with it properly for deposit. Why now? I haven't been swayed even once, but I haven't been told while I've been waiting for 5 business days. Thanks to that, I can't pay the electricity bill and I'm in great trouble. Originally it was reflected in ecoPayz as of yesterday. It's too cruel. Get my $ 500 back. please help me. When the electricity stops, both mobile phones and personal computers. You will not be able to use anything. It looks cute even though it has children. It's too terrible. Nice to meet you. Please really help me. I have a mental illness and I also have severe depression and panic disorder, anxiety disorder, social phobia, and adult children. The only money I can do for my kids right now is when I get a small win with a casino deposit-free bonus and a small amount of money. please. please help me.</p>
<p>The account was closed earlier. I want you to return the money. Please help me.</p>
