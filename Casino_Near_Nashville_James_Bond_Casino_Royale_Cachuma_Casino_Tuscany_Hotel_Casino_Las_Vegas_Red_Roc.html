    <h1>Casino Near Nashville James Bond Casino Royale Cachuma Casino Tuscany Hotel Casino Las Vegas Red Roc</h1>

<p>Dear Ypsi2005,</p>
<p>We have reviewed your complaint in detail and provide the details of your complaint:</p>
<p>1) On 2023-07-14 18:31 UTC+0 you deposited 150EUR into your account and received an individual VIP 120% bonus of 180EUR.</p>
<p>2) 2023-07-14 21:15 UTC+0 you successfully wagered your bonus and the amount of 2.898EUR was transferred to your live account.</p>
<p>3) You continued playing and made three withdrawal requests of 400EUR each.</p>
<p>4) At the time of review of your withdrawal requests by the financial department it was revealed that the real funds in the amount of 30.018 EUR on your account were received from the wagering bonus which has a limit.</p>
<p>5) Your game balance was brought to 8800EUR on your game account + 1200EUR withdrawal request.</p>
<p>We provide data on the reason for writing off the amount of 21.218EUR from your game account:</p>
<p>In the email, you received information that the bonus is limited to 10.000EUR.</p>
<p>In our casino as soon as the player wagering bonus accrued to him, the entire amount of the bonus (if there are no limits on the promotion on which the bonus is accrued), which is on the game account is transferred to the real account of the player - that is, transformed into real funds.</p>
<p>If there is a limit on winning/withdrawing from the bonus, in real funds will be transferred only the amount that is set by the maximum values of the promo action.</p>
<p>If a player wagering a bonus with a win limit, in this case, he will be able to withdraw only the amount of real funds, which is set by the maximum values of the promotion.</p>
<p>In your case, you wagered the bonus amount of 2.898EUR, the rest of the funds you received by betting from this wagering. That is, this limitation also applies to it.</p>
<p>To summarize - we inform you that in order for this withdrawal restriction to be removed from your account, you should withdraw the allowed amount of 10.000 EUR from your account and your game balance in real funds should be 0.00EUR.</p>
<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>As you can see from all the information provided, all actions in relation to the player's account were made in accordance with the terms of the individual offer.</p>
<p>The player received a bonus with a limit on winnings. In this case, the limit is imposed exactly on the real funds received from the bonus funds.</p>
<p>All withdrawal requests for the player will be processed without any barriers within the specified allowable amount of 10.000 EUR. At the moment 5 players' requests for 400EUR have already been processed and the funds have been transferred to the player's bank account.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p>Dozenspins Casino Risk Department.</p>
