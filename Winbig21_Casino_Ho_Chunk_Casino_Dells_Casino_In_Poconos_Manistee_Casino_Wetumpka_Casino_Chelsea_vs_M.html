<p>Chelsea vs. Manchester City is the final game of Round 12 of the 2023-24 English Premier League, taking place at Stamford Bridge in London on Sunday, November 12</p>
<p>Manchester City is the reigning Premier League champion that‚Äôs currently sitting top of the EPL 2023-24 table. The Citizens got to the No. 1 spot in the previous gameweek thanks to their next opponent Chelsea.</p>
<p>The London Blues defeated Tottenham 4-1, a team that was at the summit of the EPL table before that game. Due to that loss, the Spurs dropped to the second spot.</p>
<p>Chelsea was able to beat the table leader in the previous round, can we see the Blues do the same once again? Judging by the Chelsea vs. Man City odds, it‚Äôs unlikely. Pep Guardiola‚Äôs boys are coming to the English capital as odds-on favorites.</p>

<p>Chelsea Players Love Big Games in 2023</p>
<p>Mauricio Pochettino‚Äôs men are 4-3-4 on the season with a big 4-1 win over Tottenham on the road in the previous round. However, there‚Äôs a caveat ‚Äì the Spurs received two red cards in that game.</p>
<p>They were up 1-0 when their first player got sent off, and 1-1 when they received the second red. With nine men on the pitch, the Spurs just couldn‚Äôt do anything.</p>

<p>This, however, doesn‚Äôt mean Chelsea didn‚Äôt do well. In fact, these guys seem to always show up in big games. In the 2023-24 season, the Blues have already played against some real heavyweights, but they did well each time. For instance, they drew 2-2 with Arsenal in the Prem and defeated tricky Brighton in the EFL Cup.</p>
<p>Is Manchester City Too Big for 2023 Chelsea</p>
<p>In the past, Chelsea vs. Man City duels were real thrillers in which each team had almost an equal chance of winning. In the post-Roman Abramovich era, Chelsea just doesn‚Äôt look as strong as before. And even before the Russian billionaire sold the club, the Blues struggled with the Cityzens.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre not saying this without proof. The Blues have lost each of the last six Chelsea vs. Manchester City meetings. In fact, the last time Chelsea defeated Man City was in the 2021 Champions League Final in Lisbon.</p>
<p>In 2023, Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men look great. They did have a couple of slips about a month ago but are 6-0-0 since. In their most recent game, they beat Young Boys 3-0 in the Champions League. In their most recent Premier League game, they demolished Bournemouth 6-1. And in their most recent away game, they beat Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs. Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>The Chelsea Blues should consider themselves lucky for beating Tottenham in the previous EPL round. But lady luck can‚Äôt be on their side for two rounds in a row. Instead, Sunday‚Äôs Chelsea vs. Man City game will be decided by the sheer quality of the teams involved, meaning that it‚Äôs Pep Guardiola‚Äôs team that‚Äôs going to win. At least that‚Äôs our prediction.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
