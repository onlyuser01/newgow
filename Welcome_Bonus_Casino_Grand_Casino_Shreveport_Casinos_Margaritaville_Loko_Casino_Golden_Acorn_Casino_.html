    <h1>Welcome Bonus Casino Grand Casino Shreveport Casinos Margaritaville Loko Casino Golden Acorn Casino</h1>

<p>Warning of "GG.BET" -</p>
<p>I have been fully verified there for 1 year and a monthly paying customer, three days ago I had my bank account that I used most of the time</p>
<p>2 payments of 50 € and 22 € each made, totaling 72 € - I also procured a real reefer for the company, he is also fully verified. I played with the € 70 beep and I was satisfied with the € 200</p>
<p>Want to pay out 190 € of it, this worked well before, only this time it keeps! × GG.BET × !!! simply include my won and paid coal and simply close my account under false pretenses. The support does not or insufficiently answer my questions, I am accused of multiple service using which in fact is simply not true in this case. Since the amount is 190 €, I consider this company to be absolutely untrustworthy, especially because I paid in more than I paid out and payment methods have always remained the same. Online cheating in slots is not possible if the provider programs his game properly, the algorithm wins in 8 out of 10 cases. I am in favor of casinos not being allowed to accept deposits if you are denied withdrawals as an undesired customer / guest. In ner spielo I do not come into the house with a lock and only have to leave when I win something, but online you are robbed and degraded because the company just does it that way and you have no chance of making a difference .. for such a company should generally not be advertised, this is the most dubious experience so far after "Jackpot Crypto" (probably the same pool) comes "GG.BET" ----- 2 black sheep in Cyrillic which I would like to warn you about / &amp; should. I will annoy the sup for a long time with it. ## Blacklist #lawless #untrust</p>
