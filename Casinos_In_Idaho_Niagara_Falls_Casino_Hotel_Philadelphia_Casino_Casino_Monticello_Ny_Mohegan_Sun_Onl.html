<p>Pollard Banknote, a marketer and developer of high-profile instant lottery games, has teamed up with the Michigan Lottery to create a new omni-channel program based on the PAC-MAN experience. This will be a brand new game that Michigan Lottery will pilot to its customers in the Great Lakes State and introduce them to an innovative approach to the popular classic.</p>
<p>PAC-MAN Comes to Live in New Lottery Game</p>
<p>The PAC-MAN experience will come with a pull-tab ticket, an instant ticket, and also be available as a dedicated online experience. The game’s design and gameplay will be focused around the carnivorous pellet-eating blob character. Pollard Banknote is helping the Michigan Lottery build from scratch, and will be overseeing every step of the process, from the pure game concept to its development and marketing execution.</p>
<p>The instant ticket will cost $2 and players will pay $1 for the pull-tab tickets. Pollard Banknote released a statement in which it called the partnership a unique opportunity to bring to the lottery one of the most recognizable arcade experiences of all times. North America and Michigan in particular are perfect places for this to happen. The statement further added:</p>
<p>“This program provides unprecedented engagement across all touchpoints and an a-maze-ing experience that will appeal to all Michigan Lottery players and PAC-MAN fans alike.” Pollard Banknote</p>
<p>The instant ticket PAC-MAN game can reward up to $30,000 as the top prize and players will have the opportunity to uncover high-paying symbols as they gorge their way through various applets.</p>
<p>Game Bound to Be Successful Owing to Gameplay and Marketing</p>
<p>Players who play the pull-tab game will have a chance to win by eating and revealing three matching consecutive symbols in a horizontal role. Commenting on this opportunity, Pollard Banknote senior director, sales &amp; marketing Donna Preziotti said:</p>
<p>“The Michigan Lottery’s decision to launch an omni-channel PAC-MAN program leverages a well-known brand that provides players with a multifaceted play experience, maximizing engagement across all Lottery channels.” Pollard Banknote senior director, sales &amp; marketing Donna Preziotti</p>
<p>Preziotti is confident that the program will prove a hit with players. Everything about it is designed to appeal Michigan Lottery’s customer base with the game’s program offering exciting gameplay and targeted and smart digital advertisement to raise awareness for the product.</p>
<p>This game will no doubt be a welcome addition to Michigan Lottery’s distinct portfolio of gaming opportunities, including pull-tabs, online and instant games, Preziotti concluded.</p>
