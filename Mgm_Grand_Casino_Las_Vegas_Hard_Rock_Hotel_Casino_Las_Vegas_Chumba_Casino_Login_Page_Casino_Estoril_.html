<p>Thank you for your reply, id0001050093265. Please understand that we also cannot proceed with this complaint only based on your suspicion. Moreover, as an employee of an independent website (casino.guru), I don't have access to information about your casino account, therefore I cannot investigate who is trying to withdraw your funds and if your feeling is correct. If you and the police wouldn't know, how would we know if there is someone trying to steal your money? It would probably be illegal for us as a third-party mediator to try to trace your transactions due to a violation of data protection regulations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you should always be the only person who has access to your casino account and if someone else managed to use it and withdraw your funds, I am sure you will agree with me that the casino is not the first to blame.</p>
<p>Lastly, this casino refused to respond to us and complaints on our platform, and will only cooperate with their approved Alternative Dispute Resolution provider (IBAS). This means that even if we wanted to help, the casino would not be willing to reply to your complaint.</p>
<p>At this point, we are not able to proceed with this case further, however, you can try contacting the ADR as the casino probably could share the required information with them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information we are forced to reject this complaint. Sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino and we will try our best to help.</p>
