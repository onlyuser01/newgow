<p>Resorts World’s grand opening Thursday on the Las Vegas Strip marks the first time in 11 years a new hotel-casino has debuted on the resort corridor.</p>

<p>At $4.3 billion, the red-tinted Resorts World Las Vegas is the most expensive hotel-casino in Nevada history, surpassing the $4.1 billion Cosmopolitan. The Cosmopolitan opened in December 2010, the last new resort on the Strip prior to Thursday’s event.</p>
<p>Resorts World is at the northwest end of the Strip, just south of Circus Circus and the smaller Slots-A-Fun casinos. The Cosmopolitan also is on the west side of the Strip, towering over the older Jockey Club near the Bellagio.</p>
<p>The 3,506-room Resorts World is owned by the Malaysian-based Genting Group. It features three Hilton-branded hotels, each with its own entrance. Midweek room rates start at $149.</p>
<p>The fanfare surrounding Thursday’s 11 pm opening mirrors the excitement over earlier grand openings that helped transform the Strip. This includes the 1989 opening of the Mirage. The Steve Wynn-built Mirage ushered in an era of themed megaresorts designed in part to attract families.</p>
<p>That era has given way to other concepts, including resorts that restrict smoking. At Resorts World, smoking will be limited to the casino.</p>
<p>Civic leaders hope Resorts World, with its high-tech ecosystem and multiple food and luxury shopping options, will help revive the north end of the Strip and nearby areas.</p>
<p>This revival includes a $1 billion addition to the Convention Center just east of the Strip and an underground Tesla people-mover system by Elon Musk’s Boring Co. The transit system ultimately will have a station at Resorts World, connecting it to the Convention Center.</p>
<p>Licensed Sexologists</p>
<p>Among the attractions at Resorts World are nine swimming pools and 40 dining and drinking establishments. One ice cream shop at the resort will sell vegan, plant-based ice cream, while another will sell alcohol-infused ice cream. Also on the property are shops selling items ranging from crystal-encrusted handbags to fine wines.</p>
<p>Also included is a Kardashian Kloset pop-up store selling clothing that members of the blended Kardashian-Jenner family have worn. Another feature is Pepper, a sexual wellness shop with licensed sexologists on staff.</p>
<p>Among the stars already set to perform at Resorts World are Celine Dion, Carrie Underwood, Katy Perry, and Luke Bryan. Singer Miley Cyrus is scheduled to appear at a July 4 event featuring a fireworks show beginning at 11 pm.</p>
<p>We’re excited about what the Genting Group has created and for people to experience Resorts World Las Vegas,” says a post this week on the Clark County government Facebook page.</p>
<p>Resorts World and the other large hotel-casinos on the Strip are in Clark County, outside Las Vegas city limits.</p>
<p>Stardust Memories</p>
<p>The Resorts World site is where the Stardust Casino was in operation for decades until it closed in 2006. The 1,500-room Stardust was imploded on March 13, 2007.</p>
<p>The Stardust achieved widespread recognition with the 1995 publication of Nicholas Pileggi’s book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas. The book focuses on Chicago oddsmaker Frank “Lefty” Rosenthal, who oversaw the Stardust and other Las Vegas casinos for Midwestern crime families.</p>
<p>Pileggi and director Martin Scorsese co-wrote the screenplay for the Las Vegas Mafia movie Casino, based on the book. For the movie, the name of the Stardust was changed to the Tangiers for legal reasons.</p>
<p>Other Mob-connected casinos from that era, including the Sands, Desert Inn, and Dunes, also have been demolished and replaced by modern resorts.</p>
