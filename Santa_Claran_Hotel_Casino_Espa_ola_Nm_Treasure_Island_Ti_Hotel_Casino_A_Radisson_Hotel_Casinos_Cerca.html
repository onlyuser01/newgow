    <h1>Santa Claran Hotel Casino Espa ola Nm Treasure Island Ti Hotel Casino A Radisson Hotel Casinos Cerca</h1>

<p>Dear Gaming Authorities,</p>
<p>I, [name hidden by Casino.Guru administration], is a resident of [address hidden by Casino.Guru administration].</p>
<p>I opened an account no. [account number hidden by Casino.Guru administration] with Win Spirit in start of this month (November 2023) operating as Complete Technologies N.V. (registration number 133283; registered address: Heelsumstraat 51, E-Commerce Park, Cura√ßao, PO Box 422), licensed by Antillephone N.V. (License No. 8048/JAZ2014-044).</p>
<p>After some losses I requested to Self Exclude myself on November 13, 2023 as I had no control on gaming and was losing heavily and I do the same for other gaming sites and they act on self exclusion immediately.</p>
<p>I wrote self exclusion email to their support as directed on their website, snip is attached, but instead of acting on it they said only my genius manager can act on this request and that manager (Thom) was a scam or might be very immature for this position as he kept delaying it and having no understanding of the request for Self-exclusion under responsible gaming. I asked on 14 Nov to cancel the request but again re-requested my account closure on 14 Nov and reiterated on 15 Nov which requests were never withdrawn from my side (all emails are attached herewith). For the live chats done with support I don't have any data which I believe authorities can retrieve from their server.</p>
<p>Instead of acting on a request of self-exclusion he kept telling me to re-think my decision again. You will get a bonus at the weekend etc etc , I asked him why you guys are not acting but the same delaying tactics were adopted instead of closing my account which cost me a lot of money. I have not been provided with account statements as well so I am unable to quote correct amounts but total deposits I believe are more than CAD $30,000/- and deposits after self-exclusion requests is approximately CAD $20,000/- I even said to them in emails refund my deposits after the self exclusion requests, I don't want previous deposits as I accept that I played for those funds but Deposits after requests of Self Exclusion are only due to mala fide intention of delaying my removal and stealing money from me.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, I request the regulator to investigate this incident and give me justice by refunding my deposits after self exclusion requests.</p>
<p>In addition to that I would request the authority to penalize them so that they understand the seriousness to act on self exclusion requests instead of purposely delaying those requests of others as well. All this situation gave me such severe trauma that I had to go to a cardiac centre for medical investigation.</p>
<p>Thank you in anticipation.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
