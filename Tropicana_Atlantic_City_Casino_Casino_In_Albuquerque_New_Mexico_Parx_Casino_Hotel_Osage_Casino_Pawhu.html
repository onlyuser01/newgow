<p>EveryMatrix has strengthened its sportsbook division, OddsMatrix, with the appointment of industry veteran Martin Clarke as the arm’s new Chief Product Officer (CPO). Clarke is a highly-regarded industry professional with an established track-record.</p>
<p>He spent a big part of his career with Betfair, helping the company develop innovative and ground-breaking concepts that are now considered must-have features for sportsbooks. Clarke has worked on Cash Out, Odds Boost, and Bet Builder features among others.</p>
<p>The man has been known to navigate the sports betting space with acumen and innate expertise he has honed over the years, developing powerful solutions for companies such as Metric Gaming and helping the company launch its B2B platform and horse racing, soccer, and US sports products, the company shared in an email press release.</p>
<p>As the division’s new CPO, Clarke will be in charge of developing and communicating clear product visions and roadmaps. He will be working directly with OddsMatrix CEO Tor Skeie to whom he will report. Clarke will similarly respond to stakeholder requirements for better features and improvements, quality assurance, and a lot more. Clarke was happy with his appointment:</p>
<p>"I’m very pleased to join EveryMatrix whose OddsMatrix platform, products and services are turning heads and making a massive difference to some of the biggest global brands."</p>
<p>His appointment signals EveryMatrix’s desire to continue delivering a strong and innovation-oriented product in the sports betting space. It comes at a time when the division has shown strong signs of picking up momentum, with a 28% year-over-year growth in gross profit. Similarly, Clarke’s appointment was hailed by Ebbe Groes, EveryMatrix CEO, who said:</p>
<p>"Martin’s arrival proves we are on the right path to accelerate our growth and success as we continue to attract major tier-1 operators."</p>
<p>OddsMatrix Sports Betting Software Solutions already delivers a range of experiences, including both sports and esports coverage. The company prides itself on delivering reliable betting data that is reliable and accurate across the board. The division presently has 150 people working under its roof.</p>
<p>In the meantime, EveryMatrix has been growing its presence in the iGaming market. The company recently secured a license in Sweden, continuing on its mission to be seen as a trusted and reliable partner in Europe. The company also expanded with a license in Connecticut, United States in March.</p>
