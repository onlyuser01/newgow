<p>Fruit Party review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fruit Party takes as its theme a kind of fairy tale hope-punk version of Candyland. All brightly lit and shiny fruit in boiled sweet colours.</p>
<p>The background world is a luminous green countryside with small houses, fairy mushrooms, and fruit trees hung with plump and juicy fruits.</p>
<p>It is a cheery, light hearted setting for a slot that reminds one of childhood television. And of the local Victorian style sweet shop.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are excellent, provided you can cope with the sickly sick bright-pastels of every part of the screen.</p>
<p>The animations are bouncy and fun, and the music is oddly reminiscent of the Banjo Kazooie soundtrack.</p>
<p>Overall, the visuals are a little hard to get on board with fully, but they are executed with a great deal of skill by Pragmatic Play's designers.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fruit Party is played on a seven by seven grid. Winning combos are made by five or more of the same symbol connected horizontally and/or vertically.</p>
<p>Every symbol in a winning group has a chance of having a x2 multiplier added to it.</p>
<p>Winning combos are removed from the reels and a cascade occurs where new symbols fall in from above.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol.</p>
<p>The only special symbol is the Scatter symbol and three or more of them anywhere on the reels awards the player ten free spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins, 10 more free spins can be added to the total for three more Scatters. Each additional Scatter above three gets the player an additional free spin added to their total. I.e. 11 spins for four Scatters, etc...</p>
<p>All winning symbols can have either a x2 or x4 multiplier added to them. If more than one symbol in a winning combination has a multiplier, the multipliers are applied in sequence up to a maximum total multiplier of x256.</p>
<p>For example if a combination contains a x2, a x3, and a x4 multiplier the total multiplier is x24(=3<em>2</em>4).</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.47%, a chunk over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Fruit Party is a fun, fast paced grid slot.</p>
<p>The rather childish colour scheme and visual elements belie a complex and exciting game.</p>
<p>Its combination of high RTP and high volatility make it perfect for our preferred strategies. Overall, we strongly recommend this slot.</p>
