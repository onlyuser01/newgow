<p>Charlie Chance review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around classic black and white animation.</p>
<p>Players will enter an underworld filled with mischievous devils and jagged stalactites. Treading carefully, players will help an ill-fated gent named Charlie navigate the hellish setting.</p>
<p>This is a fun slot for players who love whimsical animation, but also want a ghoulish vibe.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The cheerful classic soundtrack rollicks along adding a vintage mood. The reels spin and land with a satisfying click, and wins provoke a jingle of coins.</p>
<p>The animation style makes a successful attempt at imitating old- school cartoons of the 1930s. Though the setting is rendered in black and white, the symbols themselves are accented with colour. This ensures they stand out and look enticing.</p>
<p>The hapless Charlie character stands out on the reels, his brow dripping sweat. Players will see he clearly needs their help, especially after the grinning purple demons make an appearance.</p>
<p>A sultry yet devious-looking redhead also makes an appearance. She’s adorned with horns and flames hover in her hand, making it clear that she is the one in control.</p>
<p>The cavernous underworld setting effectively creates a sense of tension. The spooking walls come alive with shadows of demons, as well as spiderwebs. A playful sense of the macabre keeps it both creepy and fun.</p>
<p>The lower-paying symbols include card suits animated with thorny metal frames. They seem imprisoned in their reels.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Charlie Chance is a five reel, three row slot.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from left to right.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>When Wild symbols are part of a win, a multiplier will appear above the reel. That multiplier will be applied to any win on that reel. These multipliers may be x2, x3, and x5.</p>
<p>While players are in the base game, landing 2 Scatters will prompt a re-spin. The reels with Scatters will stay in place during this re-spin and any Scatters that land will trigger further re-spins. This will continue until no more Scatters land.</p>
<p>When players land 3 or more Scatter symbols, this will trigger the Free Spins feature. Depending on the number of Scatters landed, players will also be awarded an increasing number of multipliers.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, a multiplier will appear over one reel and will be applied to any wins on that reel. These multipliers will increase in value should the Free Spins feature be prompted by a greater number of Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins, any Wild symbols will stick to the reels, but change position for every spin.</p>
