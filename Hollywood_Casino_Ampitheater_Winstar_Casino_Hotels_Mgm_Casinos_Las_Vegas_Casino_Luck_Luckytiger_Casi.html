    <h1>Hollywood Casino Ampitheater Winstar Casino Hotels Mgm Casinos Las Vegas Casino Luck Luckytiger Casi</h1>

<p>Blackjack Game Rules:</p>
<p>The first is that you must enter with a minimum of 5,000 pesos per play.</p>
<p>The second the bet must not exceed the amount of 100,000 pesos per play</p>
<p>The rules for users you can enter and bet wherever you want as long as there is room and as long as you comply with both rules 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The video clearly shows the facts, please enter the following link to review the video:</p>

<p>In the next play that I am going to show you, the action is clearly seen, I am in the center and on the right hand side of the dealer a player enters who is allowed to bet 2500 pesos, as it is clearly stipulated at the top and in the rules of the game that the minimum is 5000 pesos, at the moment I see that action I wanted to cancel my bet but I didn't have time, and that's when I start writing to the dealer through the chat that is in the upper left part.</p>
<p>Transcription of text that I wrote in the video to the Dealer, please watch the video.</p>
<p>English: Hey the minimum is 5000 how come…</p>
<p>Translation: Hey, the minimum bet is 5000 how come…</p>
<p>This happens during the play, and the dealer ignores my comment.</p>
<p>English: He's betting 2500…</p>
<p>Translation: He is betting 2500…</p>
<p>English: Call your Manager…</p>
<p>Translation: Call your supervisor…</p>
<p>I ask him to speak to his supervisor, and he again ignores me.</p>
<p>English: That is cheating bro…</p>
<p>Translation: That is cheating brother…</p>
<p>English: The minimum is 5000…</p>
<p>Translation: The minimum is 5000…</p>
<p>English: How come you guys allow…</p>
<p>Translation: How come they allow that…</p>
<p>English: I'm recording everything bro, that is cheating…</p>
<p>Translation: I am recording everything and that is cheating…</p>
<p>Here I ended up better for leaving because they ignored my comments, an arrogance that you feel when they take advantage of that way.</p>
<p>What seems strange to me is that the system does not allow you to bet less than 5,000 pesos, most likely it was an administrator who has access to the system, because later I went back and tried to bet 2,500 pesos and the system did not allow it, but they didn't expect me to be recording the interaction, much less to realize it.</p>
<p>Here we have an example of how casinos operate with impunity and cheat, how is it that they did not stop the play when I was indicating that they should not have dealt cards to a player who is not complying with the rules, because they did not even communicate with me to see what happened.</p>
<p>I made my claim to the Casino and their response was: that everything is fine during the play and that it does not proceed.</p>
<p>When in the Casino rules it clearly says that they should have stopped play, see the downloaded image below of the written VIP Platinum Blackjack rules.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>These Casinos need to be punished for these types of actions, since they tend to happen more than you can imagine, that is the reason why I started recording the interactions.</p>
<p>I am willing to be compensated in the following way "that the money from my bet of 50,000 pesos be returned to me because they cheated in giving a play to the wrong person.</p>
<p>The end user is the one who ends up paying the consequences for errors like this that apparently are not foreseen or regulated.</p>
