<p>Wazdan has inked its sixth deal with Paf, agreeing to power the Finnish company’s Spain-facing brand with iGaming content.</p>
<p>Wazdan, a provider of innovative games to the online casino industry, has reinforced its presence in Spain through a new deal with a local gaming operator. The supplier has agreed to power Paf.es, a leading iGaming brand in Spain, with some of its best-performing gaming titles.</p>
<p>Wazdan Inks Yet another Deal with Paf</p>
<p>As per the deal, Wazdan will provide its new partner with fan-favorite gaming hits. The two parties inaugurated the partnership by launching Wazdan’s 9 Burning Dragons on Paf’s platform. The gaming companies plan to add other top performers at later dates, including best-in-class games like Fortune Reels, Hot Slot: 777 Crown, 9 Lions and Larry the Leprechaun.</p>
<p>The current partnership agreement expands Wazdan’s existing relationship with Paf. Spain will be the sixth market where the two parties have joined forces.</p>
<p>Originally a Finnish company, Paf is an Åland-based gambling brand that donates its proceeds to various good causes. The operator is committed to supporting local health and cultural programs while running a variety of sustainability projects. Paf has now grown into an international operator and has strong presence in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Spain and Sweden.</p>
<p>For Wazdan, Paf.es will be the second Spanish operator it has inked an agreement with. The provider first made a foray into the country in November when it inked an agreement with Luckia, a major Spanish operator.</p>
<p>Both agreements are in line with Wazdan’s overall expansion strategy that has seen the company launch its engaging and attractive slots in numerous markets. The company’s strategy is simple as it would often create innovative spins of beloved concepts, making its titles suitable for all kinds of gamblers.</p>
<p>Paf Is Excited to Offer Best-in-class Experiences to Spanish Customers</p>
<p>Paf’s head of games content, Eric Castro, spoke about the new agreement with Wazdan. He lauded the gaming specialist as an “incredibly exciting developer” and praised it for its consistently high-quality games, engaging and innovative features and robust mathematical models.</p>
<p>Castro noted that he cannot wait to diversify Paf.es’ portfolio with more games developed by the operator and is looking forward to engaging his company’s customers with thrilling iGaming content.</p>
<p>Bekki D’Agata, Wazdan’s commercial director, on the other hand, applauded Paf for its dedication to its customers and its desire to always provide players with unforgettable experiences.</p>
<p>Our portfolio is packed with titles that players in Spain find refreshing and engaging, and we look forward to working together with Paf to further enhance our content’s reach in the country. Bekki D’Agata, commercial director, Wazdan</p>
<p>A week ago, Wazdan signed its second Bulgaria-facing deal, agreeing to provide Alphawin with 14 of its best games.</p>
