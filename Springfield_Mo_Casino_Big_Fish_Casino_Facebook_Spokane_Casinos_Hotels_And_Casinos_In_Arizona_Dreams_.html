<p>Social media giant Facebook implemented an update on its policies for online gambling advertising. Under the new rules, some companies interested in promoting online gambling would need to contact Meta for written permission.</p>
<p>New Policy Impacts Gambling Ads on Facebook</p>
<p>Updating its policy on online gambling advertising means that gambling companies seeking to promote their products need to submit a special form to Meta. In the form, they will be required to submit evidence that the gambling activities they offer are licensed within the jurisdiction targeted by the gambling ads.</p>
<p>Meta described online gambling and gaming as “any product or service where anything of monetary value is included as part of a method of entry and prize.” Any ads that involve the promotion of such activities via Facebook fall under the regulation of the updated policy on advertising. In addition, Meta explained that gambling ads cannot target any individuals under the age of 18.</p>
<p>“Authorized advertisers must follow all applicable laws and include targeting criteria consistent with Meta’s targeting requirements. At a minimum, ads may not be targeted to people under 18 years of age,“ reads Meta’s advertising policy</p>
<p>Written Permission Is Needed</p>
<p>Meta provided details explaining which forms of gambling require written permission. The new policies affect all forms of online gambling, such as advertising “common types of gambling include betting, lotteries, raffles, casino games, fantasy sports, bingo, poker, skill game tournaments and sweepstakes,” Meta explained.</p>
<p>Other forms of gambling that also require written permission for advertising include games that require a monetary value for entry featuring prizes with monetary value; this, according to the platform includes not only cash but also digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Games that require the user to pay in order to play or pay to get an advantage in winning a prize of monetary value also fall under the regulation.</p>
<p>Finally, Meta explained that gambling ads “with destination (landing) pages that contain promotions for online gambling or games, even if there is no opportunity to gamble or game directly on that page, such as aggregator or affiliate sites” are also affected by the regulation and require written permission.</p>
<p>On the other hand, free-to-play games are not subject to this regulation, as well as ads that promote gambling at retail locations such as brick-and-mortar gambling venues. Offline poker tournaments can also be promoted on the condition that “the ad or destination (landing) page does not promote or facilitate online gambling.” Government and state lotteries are also not affected by the policy considering that the advertiser is in charge of the lottery directly.</p>
