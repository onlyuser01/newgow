    <h1>Casino In Shelbyville Double Down Casino Forum Casino Royale Hotel Las Vegas Nevada Casino Palace St</h1>

<p>Bragg Gaming Group, which just teamed up with bet365 in Ontario, announced the appointment of its board of directors chair, Matevž Mazij, as chief executive officer. Effective immediately, the move will see Mazij replace the outgoing Yaniv Sherman.</p>
<p>In addition to chairing Bragg Gaming’s board, Mazij is also the company’s largest stakeholder, the announcement noted. He is also the founder of Oryx Gaming, the company’s original PAM, aggregation and RGS gaming tech platform. For reference, Oryx was acquired by Bragg Gaming back in 2018.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sherman will step down from his position. His departure follows an evaluation of Bragg Gaming’s board. The replacement thus seeks to “ensure optimal alignment of the best interests of the company and its stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Mazij Is Well-Suited to Lead Bragg Gaming</p>
<p>Holly Gagnon, lead independent director of Bragg’s board, commented on the leadership change. She thanked Sherman for his exceptional leadership, commitment and contributions to the company, wishing him all the best.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gagnon promised that the board will continue to support Bragg Gaming’s senior management team as it continues to executive profitable and growth-oriented initiatives. Gagnon added that her team is certain Mazij has the needed experience and vision to further Bragg’s growth and help it generate shareholder value.</p>
<p>We are confident that as the founder and visionary of Oryx Gaming, the combination of Matevž’ significant industry experience and deep knowledge of Bragg with the Company’s experienced senior leadership team favorably positions Bragg to continue successfully executing on our key strategic objectives and serve our valued customers and partners with excellence. Holly Gagnon, lead independent director, Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Mazij Hopes to Bring New Perspectives</p>
<p>Mazij also expressed his thoughts on his new appointment. Having served the company’s board for several years, he said that he is glad to return to an operational role and promised to lead Bragg toward “continued top-line and cash flow growth.</p>
<p>Bragg possesses many opportunities to further grow our scale of operations across North America, Europe and evolving global regulated iGaming markets. Matevž Mazij, CEO, Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Mazij concluded that he is looking forward to working with the company’s senior management and team members to “bring fresh perspectives” to the company.</p>
<p>In other news, Bragg recently launched its games with Unibet in the United Kingdom, following a launch with FanDuel in Michigan and Connecticut.</p>
