    <h1>Casino Font Casino Hollywood Fl Pocono Casinos Wynn Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Horseshoe Casino Blac</h1>

<p>Saturday morning at the Golden Nugget Casino in Biloxi, MS, was more eventful than usual. Just after the new day had begun, the casino turned into a crime scene after an argument led to an altercation on the gaming floor, resulting in one man being shot and killed and another in custody. The incident is still being investigated by law enforcement.</p>
<p>Golden Nugget Visit Turns Deadly</p>
<p>As is typical with murder investigations, all of the details are still not available, but police have indicated that some type of dispute in the parking lot of the Golden Nugget was the catalyst for the murder. Jereme Lamond Jones, 30, of Mobile, AL, is said to be the gunman in an attack against 41-year-old Randy Johnson of Gulfport, MS. As a result of the dispute outside the casino, Johnson is thought to have sought refuge inside, but Jones followed him and shot at least ten rounds from a gun, according to witnesses. He died of multiple gunshot wounds at the scene, but no one else was injured.</p>
<p>The casino, which, according to its website, has 1,159 slots, 49 table games and a poker room, became a scene of chaos after the first shots rang out, with gamblers scrambling for cover. One casino-goer, James Robinson, was quoted by local media outlet WLBT as saying, “You heard screaming. You saw people running up the escalator. It was just chaotic.” According to some casino patrons, following the incident, the only way to exit the gaming floor was by walking past Johnson’s lifeless body.</p>
<p>Jones Charged with Murder</p>
<p>Initially, Jones ran away from the scene, but it didn’t take long for him to be caught. Law enforcement officers arrested him near the Biloxi Bay Bridge, according to a police report, and subsequently sent him to the Harrison County Jail. He was charged with first-degree murder and had his bail set at $1 million. It isn’t clear if Jones has made bail or if he will stay put pending his first appearance before a judge. That appearance is likely to come soon. He is expected to head to local criminal court sometime this week as investigators continue to piece together the story.</p>
<p>Johnson was reportedly a barber at King’s Barbershop in his hometown and leaves behind two daughters and a son.</p>
