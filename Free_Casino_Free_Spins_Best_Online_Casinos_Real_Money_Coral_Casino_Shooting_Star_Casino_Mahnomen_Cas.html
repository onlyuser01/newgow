<p>PointsBet has become the official authorized partner for the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA).</p>
<p>PointsBet Strikes a Historic Partnership with WNBA</p>
<p>Australian sportsbook PointsBet has teamed up with the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) on Friday, announcing a new alliance between the two organizations. As a result, PointsBet will serve as WNBA’s authorized gaming partner helping the sportsbook build upon its impressive footprint in the United States and notably expand on its previous ties with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and other sports bodies.</p>
<p>The present deal is a first for PointsBet as the company has never partnered with a women’s league before and provides the sportsbook with the opportunity to build its clout in a vertical that has become more relevant in recent years amid soaring financial results.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to align with the WNBA and bring the world-class PointsBet experience to one of the most digitally-engaged fan bases on earth,” said PointsBet USA CEO Johnny Aitken on the partnership. He further commended the WNBA on the “phenomenal job” the league has done in building fan engagement over the years.</p>
<p>PointsBet is confident that thanks to its technological expertise, it can create a more tailored and personalized experience that will meet fans’ needs and interests. WNBA supporters are bound to appreciate the “competitive advantage” that PointsBet can deliver through its apps and general ease of use of its sportsbook, Aitken argued.</p>
<p>Boosting Visibility and Bringing Innovation</p>
<p>PointsBet is integrating the WNBA intellectual property into its own offerings in a bid to build up brand visibility and explore additional opportunities. The deal is important to the WNBA, as well as the league is looking to expand into the sports betting landscape at a time when many other major sports bodies have been making the transition.</p>
<p>” Innovating at the WNBA and enhancing the fan experience starts with recognizing how our fans want to interact with the players, teams, and the league, and PointsBet will enhance a second screen experience that digitally engaged fans are looking for,” argued WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert.</p>
<p>She added that the organization was thrilled to be teaming up with PointsBet and committed to continue expanding in the sports betting landscape in the United States and beyond. The partnership is also an opportunity for the WNBA to work on innovative ideas and solutions.</p>
<p>PointsBet and the WNBA will similarly remain committed to upholding the integrity of WNBA games and promote responsible gambling messages and best-in-class practices. Recently, PointsBet has been able to finalize the acquisition of the Premier Turf Club to boost its involvement with the US horse racing industry.</p>
