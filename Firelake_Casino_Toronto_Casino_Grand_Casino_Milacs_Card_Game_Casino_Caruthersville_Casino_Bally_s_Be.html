    <h1>Firelake Casino Toronto Casino Grand Casino Milacs Card Game Casino Caruthersville Casino Bally s Be</h1>

<p>Global casino-entertainment company Bally’s Corporation announced a new partnership with Minor League Baseball (MiLB) Friday. Under the terms of the new multi-year collaboration, Bally’s gained rights to live broadcast, as well as exclusive free-to-play gaming content rights for its digital platforms.</p>
<p>The new partnership marks an important achievement for the duo. This is because the deal designated Bally’s as the first-ever National Media Rightsholder and Exclusive Fantasy and Gaming Partner of the MiLB.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the new collaboration is expected to deliver engaging experiences for MiLB fans, regardless if in-stadium or at home. As with similar deals, Bally’s gained rights to use official marks for marketing, broadcast, in-park signage and digital exposure of MiLB. Additionally, the deal extends to Bally’s new over-the-top, proprietary platform that delivers unique fan engagement tools, Bally Live. The application can be downloaded for iOS, as well as Android devices.</p>
<p>Via Bally Live, fans of the MiLB that attend in-person games will have the option to engage with fans outside of the stadium via a chat and watch party features. This immersive and unique form of entertainment is expected to deliver unique experiences and boost interest in MiLB games. The broadcasting via Bally Live kicks off Friday, March 31, 2023, and will run through the entire MiLB season, covering every game.</p>
<p>Besides the broadcasts, MiLB fans will have the option to enter free-to-play activities via Bally Live. Such activities are expected to include predictor games and other trivia, allowing eligible players to earn rewards via Bally’s rewards points program, Bally Bucks.</p>
<p>The Deal Brings Excitement for MiLB, Bally’s</p>
<p>Kenny Gersh, MLB’s executive vice president, media and business development, explained that the League is delighted to see MiLB designate Bally’s Corporation as an Official Partner. “Since assuming operations of Minor League Baseball in 2021, we’ve focused on growing the reach and awareness of our impressive young prospects and iconic MiLB teams,” he explained. Finally, Gersh predicted that the collaboration with Bally’s will help by enhancing the experience for MiLB fans by delivering free-to-play, fantasy and real-money games.</p>
<p>“This exciting partnership presents a remarkable opportunity for Bally’s, MiLB, and the league’s teams to come together and collaborate on delivering an exceptional experience for MiLB’s more than 30 million fans across 120 teams and ballparks.“ Soo Kim, chairman of the board of directors at Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>Soo Kim, Bally’s chairman of the board of directors, was similarly excited about the deal, acknowledging that it represents a unique opportunity for MiLB and the company. Additionally, he spoke about the fan base of baseball, which consists of more than 30 million fans. Finally, Kim said that Bally’s remains committed to leveraging innovation to deliver immersive and engaging experiences for MiLB fans.</p>
