<p>Scientific Games announced today the company signed a deal with Malta-based sports book operator Tipico to deliver its OpenGaming product suite and power up the iGaming offering of the betting company.</p>
<p>OpenGaming Product Suite</p>
<p>Scientific Games will deliver its aggregation platform, together with a comprehensive library of more than 2,000 games developed both in-house and by third parties, to support the US debut of the sports book operator in New Jersey. Its fully-licensed OpenGaming product suite will ensure Tipico has the best iGaming product offering in terms of content and features and allow it to gain an edge by attracting new players in the market.</p>
<p>“Tipico’s decision to select OpenGaming to power its new digital casino once again demonstrates the quality of our proposition, and reaffirms our position as a leading supplier in the state of New Jersey. We’re thrilled to be working with the team at Tipico and look forward to providing them with all the support to ensure that together we launch a successful offering.” Dylan Slaney, SVP Casino, SG Digital</p>
<p>The aggregation platform of Scientific Games will provide Tipico with a tried and tested product, delivering cutting edge features such as Free Rounds and Jackpots, a product that has been highly successful in the Garden State.</p>
<p>“We’re very excited to partner with Scientific Games to offer our US sportsbook players a robust new iGaming offering. With a solid history in the highly regulated U.S. market, a huge library of games and proven platform technology, Scientific Games provides us with a strong foundation to build from as we continue to expand our gaming offerings.” Adrian Vella, Managing Director, U.S. Business, Tipico</p>
<p>Tipico is currently in the process of securing the necessary licenses to offer sports betting and online casino, applying to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement as a sub-licensee of Ocean Casino Resorts in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Tipico has also teamed up with Digilant to facilitate their market launch strategy as the sports book operator is having high hopes for its US debut. The New Jersey market offers sophisticated sports betting customers and mature regulatory and licensing environment, and Tipico will look to establish firmly in the state before attempting to enter into other markets, an opportunity that certainly will not be neglected.</p>
<p>The deal with Tipico is the latest in a series of high-profile partnership agreements for Scientific Games as the operator is looking to expand its digital footprint. In June, the Las Vegas-based gambling and sports betting technology provider signed with SidePlay Entertainment to become the exclusive e-instant lottery content distributor across North America.</p>
