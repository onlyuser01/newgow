<p>In the second event of the 2019 Poker Masters, Ryan Laplante has won the $10K PLO Event.</p>
<p>$186K Win Goes to Ryan Laplante in Poker Masters PLO Event</p>
<p>The Poker Masters is a yearly tournament where some of the best poker players in the world battle it out in a wide variety of events to prove their greatness. In the second event of this year’s Poker Masters, Ryan Laplante has come out on top in the $10K Pot Limit Omaha tournament, earning himself an impressive $186,000 prize.</p>
<p>The field was relatively small, with just 62 players – but you have to consider that there was a $10,000 buy-in. That’s quite a hefty sum for a PLO tournament, so this event definitely attracted the crème-de-la-crème of pot limit players.</p>
<p>Ryan Lapalante was up against some very steep competition. For example, was one of the runners in the event, who landed some very impressive wins during the WSOP this year, include second place in the $10,000 NLHE Super Turbo Bounty event. Also in the mix was Thai Hai, who placed second in the WSOPE last month for $500,000.</p>
<p>After just one day of play, the field was whittled down to a nine-player final table. Their payouts are as follows:</p>
<p>Place Player Prize 1 Ryan Laplante $186,000 2 Chance Kornuth $124,000 3 Thai Ha $86,000 4 John Riordan $62,000 5 Ali Imsirovic $49,600 6 Tim McDermott $37,200 7 Damjan Radanov $31,000 8 Brent Roberts $24,800 9 Anthony Zinno $18,600</p>
<p>In the end, it came down to Ryan Laplante and Chance Kornuth. Kornuth held Qh Qd 6c 3s while Laplante had 10s 10h 9c 8s. All that matters next is the flop, which came down 3s 10s 3h. Even with on the turn and river, Laplante had the win all sealed up, as his trip tens beat Kornuth’s threes.</p>
<p>“I tried my best to get into good situations and make thin bluffs, but honestly, I just ran really well and that’s required to win any tournament.” – Ryan Laplante</p>
<p>Ryan Laplante now has $2.3 million in poker tournament winnings to his name. This is the first first-place prize that he has won since 2017, when he took down the competition at the Goliath Warm Up. It is his second-largest payout, just under his $190,000 win when he came first in the $565 PLO event at the 47th World Series of Poker.</p>
