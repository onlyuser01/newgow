<p>NetEnt has announced the release of its content aggregator platform, NetConnect. The platform will allow Net Entertainment’s partners to achieve deeper market penetration and reach a new customer base.</p>
<p>NetConnect Launches Adding Red Tiger Gaming’s Portfolio of Games</p>
<p>Swedish casino game maker NetEnt has launched a namesake content aggregator platform, NetConnect, designed to integrate content from Red Tiger Gaming, a studio the company recently acquired, and other partners. Red Tiger Gaming is the first studio NetEnt bought earlier this year.</p>
<p>NetEnt acquired Tiger in September sealing a £220-million deal. Company CEO Therese Hillman welcomed the addition of what she described one of the most innovative companies in NetEnt’s fold.</p>
<p>As a result of today’s successful integration, any of NetEnt’s partners will be able to tap into the brand’s far-reaching customer relationship and market opportunities. Before making an official statement, however, NetEnt had already been testing the content aggregator platform.</p>
<p>Specifically, NetEnt ran a trial with Casino Room owned by Ellmount Gaming Ltd. to determine whether NetConnect was prepared for an official release.</p>
<p>Reaching New Markets and Customers</p>
<p>Net Entertainment operates in regulated markets only, adding a layer of security for players and business partners who strive to upholding the industry’s good name.</p>
<p>The newly-released platform provides access to NetEnt Engage, an award-wining gamification and bonus solution.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, NetEnt Chief Product Officer Henrik Fagerlund commended the team for the efforts that have gone in creating a platform to bring together Red Tiger and NetEnt.</p>
<p>“It also shows great promise for NetEnt Connect which is a key part of NetEnt strategy going forward. “</p>
<p>Red Tiger Gaming CEO Gavin Hamilton expressed his appreciation for having had the opportunity to sign the deal. He specified that NetEnt’s broad reach would allow Red Tiger to roll out in new regions. Hamilton then concluded:</p>
<p>“I’m very excited that the early collaboration between the two companies since the deal was completed has allowed NetEnt customers to go live seamlessly with Red Tiger too”</p>
<p>Full Market Launch in 2020</p>
<p>The current version of NetConnect is a preliminary product NetEnt plans to roll out in full come 2020. NetEnt will launch market by market and extend the platform to other partners.</p>
<p>The company already has offices in eight countries with a combined staff of over 900 people. In December 2018, NetEnt laid off employees to boost its gaming department and boost production to two new titles every month of 2019.</p>
<p>NetEnt is on the Nasdaq Stockholm.</p>
<p>Earlier this year in July, NetEnt received an Interactive Gaming Manufacturer Conditional License by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB). The receiver of the license was NetEnt Americas LLC, the Swedish company’s US-facing subsidiary.</p>
<p>The deal is an important milestone for the company as Pennsylvania is the second most populous online legal gambling market after New Jersey. The Division of Gaming Enforcement, the New Jersey regulator, granted the company a permanent license in February 2019.</p>
