<p>Cordish Companies Prepping Petersburg Casino Plan in Virginia</p>

<p>The Baltimore-based gaming firm operates three Live! casinos in Maryland and Pennsylvania. The company has additionally developed non-gaming entertainment districts under the Live! brand in multiple states.</p>
<p>Cordish has its eyes set on Virginia for its next play. The company missed out on Richmond’s casino opportunity last year after leaders in the capital city went with a $565 million casino pitch from a consortium led by Urban One, a Black-focused media conglomerate.</p>
<p>But Richmond voters ultimately rejected the Urban One plan, called ONE Casino + Resort. That prompted Virginia Sen. Joe Morrissey (D-Petersburg) to initiate state legislation to allow Petersburg to instead consider a casino. Petersburg is about 15 miles south of the ONE Casino site near the Philip Morris tobacco along I-95.</p>
<p>Though Morrissey’s bill didn’t pass this year, he plans to resurrect the bill in 2023.</p>

<p>Virginia’s commercial gaming bill, passed in 2020 and signed by then-Gov. Ralph Northam (D), allowed only certain cities that have long experienced economic hardship to consider a casino development. Five cities met the specific qualifying criteria: Richmond, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Bristol, and Danville.</p>
<p>All but Richmond have since passed local casino referendums in hopes of jump-starting their economies in each region. Richmonders narrowly opted against the ONE Casino + Resort plan 51-49%.</p>
<p>Richmond hopes to reask voters during the 2023 election about the gaming initiative. Mayor Levar Stoney (D) and the majority of the Richmond City Council are of the belief that a more coordinated message promoting the economic benefits of ONE Casino + Resort would result in a different outcome. But Morrissey believes a second casino referendum in Richmond would go against the democratic process.</p>
<p>The state senator, who lost the 2016 Richmond mayoral race to Stoney before seeking the state Senate, believes a casino in Petersburg would still aid Richmond in its economic recovery. And Morrissey says the people of Petersburg are more supportive of allowing a casino in their town.</p>
<p>The Petersburg City Council earlier this month passed a resolution identifying Cordish Companies as its preferred casino developer, should Virginia allow the city to consider a gaming resort. During a council meeting this week, Cordish Chief Operating Officer Zed Smith said the company is finalizing its Petersburg blueprint.</p>
<p>Smith says he expects the final scheme to be revealed to the council within 30 days.</p>
<p>Cordish, Morrissey Revenge</p>
<p>Morrissey and Cordish both have added reason to be optimistic about the chances of building a casino in Petersburg after both were unwelcomed in Richmond.</p>
<p>Along with Morrissey being rejected by city voters in favor of Stoney back in 2016, Richmond leaders last year rejected Cordish’s casino plan for the city.</p>
<p>Cordish targeted Arthur Ashe Blvd. in the historic Scott’s Addition neighborhood northwest of downtown Richmond. The company presented a $610 million plan featuring a 300-room hotel with 18 restaurants, a movie theater, a full spa and wellness center, convention and meeting space, and a sprawling casino floor measuring 250,000 square feet.</p>
<p>But the Richmond City Council went with Urban One, a company that has no track record developing or running a casino. The company tried to satisfy lack of experience concerns by partnering with Peninsula Pacific Entertainment, a casino operator that also operates historical horse racing (HHR) machines at five Rosie’s Gaming Emporium locations in Virginia.</p>
<p>P2E, which is in the process of being acquired by Churchill Downs, Inc., is additionally building a $400 million HHR gaming resort destination called The Rose Gaming Resort in Dumfries, about 30 miles south of DC.</p>
