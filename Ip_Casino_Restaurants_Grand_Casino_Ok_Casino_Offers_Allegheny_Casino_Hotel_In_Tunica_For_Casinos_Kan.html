<p>Kansas City Chiefs vs San Francisco 49ers is a rematch of Super Bowl LVI in 2020. The Chiefs won that game, as well as the one played in the 2021 season. The big question is can they get to their third straight win over the Niners?</p>
<p>Oddsmakers seem to think so, giving the Chiefs the role of the three-point favorite. Still, knowing that the Chiefs vs 49ers Week 7 game is played in San Francisco, we think that the hosts need to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Chiefs Determined to Bounce Back After a Home Loss in Week 6</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Kansas City Chiefs suffered their first regular-season loss at Arrowhead Stadium in almost a year. The team that beat them is the Buffalo Bills, who are the no.1 favorites to win the Super Bowl this season. That said, losing to the Bills isn’t something the Chiefs should feel too bad about, especially not because they lost by just four points.</p>
<p>They did okay offensively, with Patrick Mahomes passing for two touchdowns. They also did okay defense-wise; it’s just that the Bills offense was even better. But the Niners aren’t as good as the Bills, which is why bookmakers expect the Chiefs to do well on Sunday.</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers Mustn’t Be Underestimated</p>
<p>The last time these two met at Levi’s Stadium in San Francisco, the visitors won by three points. It happened in the regular season of 2021, and the oddsmakers expect to see something similar in Week 7 of the 2022 season. We, however, call for caution, because the Niners look stronger in 2022 than last year.</p>
<p>They are 3-3, which isn’t that great, especially because all three games that they lost this season were against underdogs – Chicago Bears, Denver Broncos, and Atlanta Falcons.</p>
<p>Against favorites, however, the Niners tend to do great. For instance, they destroyed the reigning NFL champions, the Los Angeles Rams, 24-9 in Week 4.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs vs San Francisco 49ers Prediction</p>
<p>In 2022, Kansas City is all about the partnership between Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce. San Francisco, on the other hand, is a team that has many more weapons. Truth be told, the Niners’ weapons aren’t as sharp as the Chiefs’ main weapon, but at least they have more options on their hands. We think that could be the key factor in Week 7.</p>
<p>The Niners have the manpower needed to, if not tame, then at least slowdown Mahomes &amp; Kelce, while their offense should be capable to score at least a touchdown or two. Whether that’s going to be enough for their fourth win of the season, we’re not so sure. We do, however, think it’s very likely they’re not going to lose by a large margin to the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Pick: San Francisco 49ers (+3)</p>
