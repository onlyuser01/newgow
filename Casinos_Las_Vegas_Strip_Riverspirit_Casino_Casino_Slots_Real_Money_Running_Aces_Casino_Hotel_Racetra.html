<p>The melee involved a “large” number of patrons at the Centrale Casino Bar, located in the Fox Tower early Saturday morning, according to The Day newspaper.</p>
<p>Tribal Police Chief William D. Dittman said the wounded man lost a lot of blood. He was taken to a local hospital where he was listed in stable condition late Saturday, the report adds. The victim’s name was not released.</p>
<p>Robert J. Haines, 40, of Chicopee, Massachusetts was charged with second-degree breach of peace and third-degree assault as a result of the fight, police said. Other arrests are possible as tribal police were reviewing surveillance video and interviewing patrons who were in the Mashantucket bar before closing time of 2 am.</p>
<p>New Years’ 2019 Foxwoods Melee</p>
<p>Saturday’s fight was less severe than one that erupted Jan. 2, 2019 at the casino. Back then, three people were stabbed at Foxwoods early on New Year’s morning.</p>
<p>The 2019 melee took place in the Fox Tower garage and expanded into the area of the casino near Centrale Bar, tribal police said at the time. It was also before closing time.</p>
<p>Two of the victims were taken to a local hospital, with one of them suffering two stab wounds in the abdomen. The third refused treatment.</p>
<p>The New Year’s knife fight led to at least 10 arrests following a lengthy inquiry. One 17-year-old was charged with breach of peace and the other with attempted first-degree assault.</p>
<p>Police arrested five suspects shortly after the fight. Others were charged after police watched surveillance video to identify assailants.</p>
<p>Cheating Allegations at Foxwoods</p>
<p>Foxwoods saw other crime over recent years. In December, three defendants accused of baccarat cheating at Foxwoods had their cases dismissed after undergoing the state’s accelerated rehabilitation program.</p>
<p>Accelerated rehabilitation is a Connecticut probation program whereby offenders have charges dismissed. No conviction appears on their records.</p>
<p>In the series of incidents, a New York couple had allegedly conspired with an ex-table game dealer at the casino to allegedly swindle more than $500,000 in illicit winnings on mini baccarat in 2014.</p>
<p>Foxwoods security began monitoring the trio after the couple won more than $80,000 on the table game during a three-day period. The single dealer allegedly dealt most of the time during their run.</p>
<p>Last August, an ex-blackjack dealer at Foxwoods admitted to stealing approximately $18,000 largely by overpaying a player in winnings she was collaborating with in the scheme. The dealer pleaded guilty to third-degree larceny and cheating.</p>
<p>The dealer allegedly paid the player for losing bets. She also failed to collect for tie bets, and gave her gaming chips, a court affidavit claimed.</p>
<p>The ex-dealer was also charged in connection with seven other incidents in October 2016 and November 2016. They also involved cheating.</p>
<p>She was granted five years of probation. The dealer will have to repay the casino $8,000.</p>
<p>The player was also granted accelerated rehabilitation. She allegedly received 68 overpayments in a 90-minute time frame.</p>
