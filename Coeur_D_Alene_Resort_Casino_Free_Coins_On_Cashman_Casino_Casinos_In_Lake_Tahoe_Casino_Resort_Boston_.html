    <h1>Coeur D Alene Resort Casino Free Coins On Cashman Casino Casinos In Lake Tahoe Casino Resort Boston</h1>

<p>This agreement follows the success of last year’s Cheltenham Festival horse racing content hub that SSG managed for Sky Betting and Gaming</p>
<p>Spotlight Sports Group (SSG), a leading provider of sports tech, content and media, has unveiled a new agreement with the UK-based operator Sky Betting and Gaming. Under the agreement, the supplier will develop and manage a Cheltenham Festival racing content hub for the gambling company.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the two companies have worked together. The current agreement follows the success of the previous Cheltenham Festival content hub that the provider produced for Sky Betting and Gaming in 2022.</p>
<p>Because of how positive the fan response was, this year’s iteration of the hub will have many new features and an expanded content section. For example, the 2023 content hub will sport an add-to-betslip mechanic, live odds, social share features and customer CMS access.</p>
<p>The deal will allow Sky Betting and Gaming to distinguish itself from its competition ahead of the famous Cheltenham Festival. The hub is sure to channel many horse racing enthusiasts toward the operator’s platform, thus maximizing profits during one of the biggest annual racing events.</p>
<p>SSG Said Sky Racing and Gaming Is “Brilliant to Work with”</p>
<p>Andrew Mook, Sky Betting and Gaming’s head of marketing strategy &amp; planning, commented on the agreement with SSG. He said that his company knows how effectively engaging such content hubs tend to be. Because of that, Sky Betting and Gaming is excited to once again welcome Spotlight Sports Group and benefit from its technical expertise to maximize the potential opportunity from the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
<p>At the same time, this agreement will allow Sky Betting and Gaming to stand out from its competition, Mook said.</p>
<p>Daniel Smith, head of UK and Ireland B2B sales at SSG, echoed Mook’s sentiments, saying that his team is also happy to continue working with the operator. Smith praised Sky Betting’s team for being so “brilliant to work with” and said that he cannot wait to breathe life into their content strategy.</p>
<p>We are delighted to be working with one of the biggest brands in the industry again this year, as we roll out the newest edition of the Cheltenham Festival Hub. We’re especially excited to showcase an adapted and amended hub this year following learnings from last year. Daniel Smith, head of UK and Ireland B2B sales, SSG</p>
<p>Smith promised that the new Cheltenham Festival hub will be the best one yet.</p>
<p>SSG is known for its impressive content hubs. In December, the sports specialist unleashed content hubs for the FIFA World Cup event, engaging sports aficionados across several markets.</p>
<p>The company is moving forward and improving its products. In January, SSG introduced upgrades to its Superfeed engine and SaaS product line.</p>
