    <h1>Catfish Bend Casino Ti Casino Casino In Deadwood Is Casino A True Story Online Casino For Real Money</h1>

<p>Dear Maria,</p>
<p>I am very sorry for the confusion. My last post was a reaction on your previous post about UKGC license. We always try our best to help players, but we have to review each case individually based on the provided evidence and then decide, who is right. About the self-exclusion, you are right. If you finished the self-exclusion by email and your account was blocked, or you received the confirmation about your self-exclusion, then casino should not reopen your account (the reopening would be possible, but only in particular circumstances). The account must stay closed for a cool-off period, which is usually 6 months or more.</p>
<p>But from what you wrote it is not clear if you asked them to close the account and they did it based on your request, or they closed your account because you reported them (there is a big difference between closing the account and self-exclusion). Please explain to us how exactly you asked for your account to be closed. The best would be, if you posted an email about self-exclusion here, or you can forward it to my email address - kristina.s@casino.guru. We will be more than happy to help you with this issue, as we believe that failed self-exclusion is very serious mistake from the casino's side.</p>
<p>And back to UKGC license: We have a very similar opinion as you about the licenses. But our goal is to list on our website all of the casinos and then sort them out and recommend only the good ones. If we delete this casino from our list, then players can go there without our warning about license and reputation (I am sorry, but the license has a questionable reputation, rating of the casino is questionable as well - I would not choose this casino, if I were from the UK).</p>
<p>Here is an example, that could help you better understand our standpoint:</p>
<p>You are from the UK, and in the UK people drive on the left side of the road - that's the law. In my country, people drive on the right side of the road. But we are not building special roads for UK citizens because their laws say people should drive on the left side of the road.</p>
<p>And the same principe is applied for the UKGC license - you are working on the UK market, you need to follow the UK law. But if you come to play in Curaçao licensed casino (by your free will and they are not targeting the UK market), you need to follow Curaçao laws.</p>
<p>And all these facts we consider in our review - that's why casinos which have UKGC license are on the top with rating 9+ and casinos with Curaçao license accepting the UK players have a questionable reputation.</p>
<p>Maria, if you are still interested in our help, please let me know and we try our best to resolve this case. Don't forget to post here a screenshot of your request for self-exclusion, and a reaction from the casino, if there is any.</p>
<p>Again, I am really sorry for this misunderstanding.</p>
