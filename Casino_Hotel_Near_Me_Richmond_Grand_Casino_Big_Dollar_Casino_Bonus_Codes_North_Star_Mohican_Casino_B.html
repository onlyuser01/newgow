<p>GiG pointed out that its new bond has been well received among its investors in multiple regions</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group, a company offering cloud-based product and platform services and performance marketing to clients within the iGaming industry, has announced the completion of its latest bond issue.</p>
<p>According to the company’s official announcement, it has successfully completed the issuance of 3-year EUR 75 million ($81 million) equivalent senior secured bonds. The bonds are split in a EUR 45 million ($48.5 million) and a SEK 350 million ($33.5 million) tranche and have a combined borrowing limit of EUR 100 million equivalent.</p>
<p>As noted by the company, the proceeds of this issuance will be used to call the company’s outstanding SEK 550 million bond in full. In addition, the money will help GiG fund its acquisition of KaFe Rocks. The money will also contribute to the company’s general corporate purposes.</p>
<p>GiG added that a call notice for the existing SEK 550 million bond will be sent shortly. In the meantime, GiG will apply for its new bond to appear on the Nasdaq Stockholm and Frankfurt Stock Exchange Market.</p>
<p>GiG also pointed out that its new bond has been well received among its investors in multiple regions, including the Nordics, Continental Europe and the United States. The company mentioned that both existing and new investors participated in the placement of the transaction.</p>
<p>Finally, GiG mentioned that ABG Sundal Collier and Pareto Securities acted as joint managers and bookrunners for the placement of the new bond issue.</p>
<p>Other GiG Developments</p>
<p>A month ago, GiG set out to acquire KaFe Rocks in a new EUR 35 million (approximately $37.4 million) acquisition deal. The deal is in line with the former party’s goal to become a leading generator in the iGaming market and expand its presence across the NA region.</p>
<p>Around the same time, GiG also published its Q3 results, reporting impressive momentum and growth across multiple metrics. The company’s quarterly revenue reached an all-time high of €31.8 million ($33.92 million), reflecting an impressive 39% year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>In early November, GiG also agreed to integrate the leading Jackpot Management System provided by Jooba Tech into its platform, allowing it to better serve its global network of iGaming operators.</p>
