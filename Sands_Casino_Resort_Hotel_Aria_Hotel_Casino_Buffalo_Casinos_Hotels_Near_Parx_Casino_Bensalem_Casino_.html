<p>While discussions about better five-year contracts for hospitality and gaming industry workers continue, options for strike are still on the table</p>
<p>Negotiations between unionized workers across Las Vegas and the three leading casino and entertainment giants, Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts continue. Approximately 60,000 workers from the casino and entertainment vertical, including dealers, bartenders, housekeepers, bellmen and other employees are represented by the Culinary Workers Union. Ultimately, the Union proposes better conditions for the workers under a new five-year contract.</p>
<p>Last week, leaders of the Union met with Caesars and MGM Resorts. This week, negotiations continued with discussions with Wynn Resorts on Monday. Despite the talks, negotiations are slow and tension remains high, especially considering the recent arrest of peaceful protesters.</p>
<p>Now, as announced by KTNV, Ted Pappageorge, the lead negotiator for the Culinary Union and secretary-treasurer, progress is made but more needs to be done. He spoke about the importance of financial benefits, including health care, for the whole duration of the new five-year contract.</p>
<p>“I am happy to say we have made more progress than we made in quite a while. Unfortunately, not nearly enough,” explained Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Union</p>
<p>Moreover, Pappageorge addressed growing concerns related to technology, including a reduction in the number of employees. He revealed that while it is yet for technological solutions to replace humans, employees within the hospitality, entertainment and gaming industries need to have guarantees that their jobs would be protected.</p>
<p>Workers Ready for a Strike</p>
<p>The demands of employees from the gaming and entertainment sector come at a time when auto workers across the US have been on strike for several weeks. Only recently, they were able to reach a deal with the country’s top automakers, pushing for better pay and working conditions.</p>
<p>Similarly, some of the most important demands within the Unions’ negotiations with the leading gaming and entertainment companies include better wages, health care benefits as well as job security.</p>
<p>However, despite the recent progress, Pappageorge said that the workers remain ready for a strike. “I think we’ve been able to make some movement, but if we were having to make the decision today, it wouldn’t be enough. And I think these workers would authorize a strike,” he explained according to a report by the Las Vegas Sun.</p>
<p>He said that just like gambling operators make record profits, workers deserve “record contracts.” Pappageorge confirmed that while negotiations are ongoing, preparations for a strike continue. According to him, if the workers go on strike, this may be the largest one in the history of Sin City.</p>
