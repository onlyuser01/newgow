<p>Incredible Technologies (IT), a company that specializes in designing and manufacturing coin-operated video games, announced a new deal with Bragg Gaming Group (Bragg). Details of the new collaboration were released Thursday and seek to extend the distribution of IT's leading iGaming products via Bragg.</p>
<p>Previously, IT inked a distribution deal with Spin Games, a company that earlier this year was acquired by Bragg. Now, the new deal uses the strong foundation set by the existing deal and seeks to expand it further.</p>
<p>In a statement released on November 3, 2022, Bragg's President and Founder of Spin Games, Kent Young, said that the company is focused on extending its collaborations with third-party operators that can help improve its gaming portfolio. Moreover, he acknowledged that such deals help complement Bragg's strategic growth plans.</p>
<p>He added: "The Spin RGS has already been a home for some of Incredible Technologies' high-performing iGaming titles and we are thrilled to expand on this relationship going forward." Young outlined that the newly expanded collaboration with IT allows Bragg to deliver exciting new games such as Ultra Rush Sky Fire and Ultra Rush Golden Steed for its customers in North America and across the company's global platform.</p>
<p>Daymon Ruttenberg, IT's Senior Vice President of Gaming, added: "Our games have already gained fans on existing iGaming platforms under Spin's brand." Finally, he said: "We're eager to extend the partnership with Bragg and are thankful for a partner that's committed to the success of innovative games in new iGaming markets."</p>
<p>IT leverages decades of experience in software and hardware development for the gambling industry. Besides unrivaled land-based experiences, the company also has top-performing iGaming titles such as Big Prize Bubblegum Deluxe and Crazy Money 2. In fact, the two titles are already available thanks to Bragg's remote games service (RGS) technology.</p>
<p>The privately held company is currently a member of the American Gaming Association (AGA), the Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers (AGEM), the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA), the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) and the Amusement Machine Operators Association (AMOA). Currently, IT has more than 250 employees.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bragg's growing portfolio is currently available in multiple different jurisdictions. The company has a presence in key US markets such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut via partnerships with Caesars Entertainment, FanDuel, DraftKings and Rush Street Interactive. Now, Bragg's latest deal with IT will further enrich its offering while at the same time expanding the reach of the developer's products.</p>
