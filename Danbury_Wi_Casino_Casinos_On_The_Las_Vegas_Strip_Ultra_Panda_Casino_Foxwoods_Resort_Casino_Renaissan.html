<p>In mid-February, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) spoke about their powerful alliance with tier 1 Betsson Group, reassuring the public that the partnership will carry through the end of 2025 at the very minimum. Now, the two have signed a fresh two-year deal, confirming their partnership in Colombia. According to the new contract, Bettson will offer GiG’s products in Colombia. The original partnership started a year ago, in June, when Betsson acquired regional operator colbet.co and decided to start using GiG’s player account management system the following month.</p>
<p>Fruitful Partnership for the Two Companies</p>
<p>The one-year agreement proved to be a highly lucrative one for Betsson both in the online and the retail market. The company managed to increase its activity with the support of GiG’s player account management platform. At the same time, GiG also strengthened its foothold in Colombia thanks to the partnership that represents its third such agreement in the country. The company has big plans for the future, in the context of the rapidly growing gaming industry in the country. In 2021, the reported online gross profits reached $420 million, signaling a massive 120% year-on-year growth compared to 2020.</p>
<p>Sportnco Gaming’s managing director Hervé Schlosser expressed his delight regarding the new Betsson agreement in Colombia. According to Schlosser, the agreement “underlines the strong geographical footprint” that the company is trying to establish in the LatAm region. He also mentioned the increasing demand for fresh solutions and their increasing reputation next to tier 1 operators like Betsson as “a great source of pride” for the group. He added that GiG is currently “full of expectation for the future”.</p>
<p>Betsson’s commercial director for Southern Europe and LatAm Andrea Rossi explained the group migrated to GiG’s platform as a way of rebranding in Colombia. Rossi further added that they selected GiG as they think of them as the “best partners with whom we can keep growing in the market”.</p>
<p>Nasdaq Stockholm-listed Betsson is currently one of the most prestigious companies in the European online gambling market. Its impressively long and powerful brand-building track was triggered both organically and with the help of acquisitions. The company provides online casinos along with proprietary sportsbook to customers spread in 19 countries</p>
<p>2012-established GiG is a leading iGaming technology company that offers world-class products and services to a variety of iGaming operators.</p>
