<p>Sportradar Integrity Services, a global supplier of sports integrity solutions, announced today an expansion of its current partnership with the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) to include a multi-year integrity services agreement.</p>
<p>Integrity Solutions and Education</p>
<p>The new agreement between Sportradar Integrity Services and the NASCAR further strengthens the leading position of the supplier of integrity solutions on the US market and underscores the car racing organization’s commitment to safeguard the sport.</p>
<p>“NASCAR’s unwavering commitment to upholding the highest levels of competitive integrity has been instrumental to its success, and we look forward to continuing to safeguard their sport through our growing portfolio of industry-leading products and solutions.” Andy Cunningham, Director, Global Partnerships, Sportradar Integrity Services</p>
<p>Sportradar Integrity Services will deploy its Universal Fraud Detection System (UFDS) to provide NASCAR with bet monitoring and reporting for all races in the NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series, and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Sportradar is a foundational component to the success of NASCAR’s involvement with sports betting. When we began our journey into legal sports betting, our first priority was to protect the integrity of our product.” Joe Solosky, Managing Director of Sports Betting, NASCAR</p>
<p>The expanded agreement features an annual in-person integrity workshop and online eLearning tutorial delivered via Sportradar’s Education &amp; Prevention Services, while the company’s Intelligence &amp; Investigation Services, as well as its Integrity Audit Service will also be at NASCAR’s disposal.</p>
<p>“Through this renewal, we’ll continue to ensure that our drivers, teams and industry stakeholders are educated on our policies. We are excited for this next step of the relationship between NASCAR and Sportradar to drive interest and engagement with our sport,” added Solosky.</p>
<p>Support Analysis of Fan Engagement</p>
<p>NASCAR will also utilize Sportradar’s Handle Estimation &amp; Reporting Service to become the first North American sports organization to gain access to the service. Under the service, Sportradar will provide NASCAR with four quarterly race handle reports and one annual American Sports Betting Handle report to enable the organization analyze aspects of fan engagement with the sport through sports betting.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Sportradar launched a second integrity unit, Sportradar Integrity Exchange, to affirm its commitment to fighting match-fixing by allowing sportsbooks to report suspicious betting activities within a centralized system with two-way channel communication.</p>
<p>The new unit is set to build upon the UFDS which in 2021 alone detected more than 900 suspicious matches across global sport as the Swiss-based sports data and technology business is determined to oust match-fixing out of sports.</p>
