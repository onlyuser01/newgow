    <h1>Chumba Casino Dubuque Casino Hollywood Casino Hotel Joliet How To Win At Casino Slots Virgin Casino</h1>

<p>Wizard Games, an Aspire Global’s brand, continues to grow its footprint in the United States through a new content partnership now live with BetMGM Casino in West Virginia. As the state reports an increase in its overall gaming revenue, so is Wizard Games moving in to expand its footprint and bring its high-grade iGaming products to the attention of players in the state.</p>
<p>Thirst for IGaming in the United States</p>
<p>The games are powered and offered through Pariplay’s Fusion platform which is part of the distribution’s efforts spearheaded by Pariplay and BetMGM. The products are already a hit with players in other jurisdictions, including New Jersey in the United States and Alberta in Canada.</p>
<p>North America is rapidly looking to add iGaming as one of the possible gaming verticals players may enjoy in real-time. New York is reportedly looking to explore an iGaming bill on top of its mobile betting experience, which could add dramatically to the state’s taxable revenue while New Jersey is set to suffer from the blowback.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wizard Games managing director Joey Hurtado welcomed the launch of the brand’s titles in New Jersey:</p>
<p>“Our games are performing strongly in North America and together with a leading brand like BetMGM, we’ll further enhance our reach and introduce our content to new audiences.” Wizard Games managing director Joey Hurtado</p>
<p>The United States is currently rapidly considering the broader adoption of iGaming beyond its bastions such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania and an iGaming spillover would add more revenue. Some have fought back against broader adoption citing concerns about commercial and tribal casinos losing clientele.</p>
<p>Welcomed Content Boost to MGM’s Offer</p>
<p>BetMGM director of gaming Oliver Bartlett welcomed the new partnership and the content opportunities that this represents. BetMGM is happy to be hosting the Wizard Games’ portfolio of titles that will help elevate the iGaming experience in West Virginia:</p>
<p>“We’re constantly looking to expand and introduce new premium titles, like those from Wizard, which helps further strengthen BetMGM’s position as the leading online casino operator in the US.” BetMGM director of gaming Oliver Bartlett</p>
<p>Wizard Games continues to build an impressive portfolio of 120 games and operates in 15 markets, making it a supplier with a vast geographical footprint and good expertise in delivering in different markets and catering to specific tastes.</p>
