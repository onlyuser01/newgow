    <h1>Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort D Iberville Ms Dubuque Casino Sunset Station Hotel And Casino West Sunse</h1>

<p>The provider of 360-degree solutions for the iGaming and gambling industry has introduced a new feature that will allow it to better address the changing dynamic of payments</p>
<p>Thanks to the Multi-Balance Feature, players will be able to enjoy a more convenient banking experience at Online and Crypto Casino platforms that are powered by NuxGame’s solutions. Players will have the opportunity to deposit, play, and withdraw with different currencies without any issues.</p>
<p>New Payment Feature Allows for Seamless In-Game Conversion</p>
<p>The Multi-Balance feature introduces a new In-Game Converter option that lets players enjoy their favorite games with a preferred currency – one that is supported by the operator – even if they deposited in a different currency originally.</p>
<p>This makes for an even more flexible experience that will empower players at all NuxGame casinos and partner operators to make the best decisions about their bankroll and overall funds.</p>
<p>This is just the latest feature to be added to NuxGame’s software, after previously the company introduced a new Loyalty Program integration, helping players find something worthwhile and offering partners the chance to improve their retention rates.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, NuxGame COO Denis Kosinsky welcomed the opportunity to see yet another strong technological solution that empowers customers in their everyday game decisions.</p>
<p>“We have empowered players to embrace diverse worlds of gaming across multiple currencies whilst reducing barriers to entry caused by transactional differences,” Kosinsky explained. He added that the new feature will make sure that players and operators use a future-proofed payment gateway that is designed to work with both traditional casinos and cryptocurrency-focused brands.</p>
<p>NuxGame Seeks to Grow Partner List and Introduce More Tech Solutions</p>
<p>NuxGame has been actively looking to make sure that its payment options are on par with player expectations. Recently, the company signed a partnership with CoinPayments to make it so that players have an easier time onboarding with cryptocurrency brands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the platform has also been expanding its content, adding titles by Pascal Games and RubyPlay, adding crash and slot games that can be shared with partner operators. NuxGame remains a leading provider of all-around solutions for the iGaming market, as it brings platform, payment, and engagement solutions for operators.</p>
