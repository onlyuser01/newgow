<p>Philadelphia Eagles Cruise to Another Win on ‘NFL Sunday’</p>

<p>Jalen Hurts strengthened his case for NFL MVP following his performance with the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The QB’s 380 yards and three passing touchdowns, plus another himself, set him up or those honors, as Philly walked away with an easy 35-10 win over the Tennessee Titans.</p>

<p>Hurts has led the Eagles to an 11-1 start to the year, the first time they have that mark since 2004, and just the fourth time in franchise history. The Eagles continue to prove why they’re solid Super Bowl contenders this year.</p>
<p>The LA Chargers can’t say the same thing. They had a chance to flip the script on a potential playoff appearance on Sunday. Despite getting off to a strong start, the Chargers faltered in front of a determined Las Vegas Raiders squad.</p>
<p>Eagles Cruise to a Win</p>
<p>The determined Hurts has already set a career-high for the Eagles with 29 TDs. This comes after adding his third career game with four scores. The first half of Sunday’s game alone was what most QBs see in a day – 268 passing yards and two TDs, as well as a rushing score.</p>

<p>Months after his trade from Tennessee, A.J. Brown was finally able to show Tennessee what a mistake they made by sending him to Philadelphia. With eight receptions and 119 yards, as well as the Eagles’ other two scores, Brown made light work of anyone who tried to cover him.</p>
<p>The Eagles’ defense was over the top as well. Last week, the Cincinnati Bengals demonstrated how to effectively slow down Titans running back Derrick Henry, when they held him to just 38 rushing yards. Philadelphia picked up a few clues from that game, and allowed just 11 carries and 30 yards for the Titans’ biggest offensive weapon.</p>
<p>Indirectly, these adjustments allowed for more pressure on QB Ryan Tannehill. He took six sacks as the offensive line fell apart, putting up just 141 passing yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>The Eagles, now at 11-1 and comfortable atop the NFC East, take on the New York Giants (7-4-1) next week. The Titans (7-5) face the division rival Jacksonville Jaguars, who took a huge 40-14 loss against the Detroit Lions on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 45 total points in the game came almost entirely from the Eagles’ performance, and barely beat the 44.5 over/under. As the NFL season has progressed, the under has hit more often. But Philadelphia had no trouble pushing the total over the top, as they set out to prove who they are.</p>
<p>Charges Fizzle in Must-Win Road Game</p>
<p>The LA Chargers couldn’t defend against a determined Las Vegas offense on Sunday. Raiders QB Derek Carr aired out the ball twice in the third quarter, connecting with wide receiver Davante Adams on a 31-yard pass for a TD. Just a few minutes later, they hooked up on a 45-yard pass for another score.</p>
<p>Adams wrapped up the game with eight receptions for 177 yards, surpassing 1,000 yards in a season for the fourth time in five years. After the crushing third-quarter performance, the Chargers would never be the same.</p>
<p>The Chargers started on the right foot, putting up 13 points in the first half against 10 for the Raiders. However, the second half belonged entirely to the Raiders, who kept LA out of the end zone in the third quarter. When the clock ran out, the Raiders emerged with a 27-20 win.</p>
<p>The offensive connection backed an aggressive defense that sacked Chargers QB Justin Herbert five times. The Raiders have now picked up three straight wins and avenged a loss to the Chargers in the season opener.</p>
<p>The loss is a significant setback for the Chargers (6-6), who look to narrowly miss a postseason spot. The season won’t be a total loss for them, though, as they will make NFL history next week.</p>
<p>The league struck a deal with Caesars Sportsbook and Genius Sports to stream live games. The first was Sunday’s matchup between the Indianapolis Colts and the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>The Chargers will see two of their games streamed before the season ends, the only team to make a double appearance. ESPN reports that next week’s contest against the Miami Dolphins will be available on Caesars, as well as the game against the LA Rams on January 1.</p>
