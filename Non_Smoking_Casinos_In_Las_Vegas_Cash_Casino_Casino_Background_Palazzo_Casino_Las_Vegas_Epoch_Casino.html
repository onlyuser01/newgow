<p>France’s national gambling operator, La Française des Jeux (FDJ), has gone live with a new online poker product range, introducing a new Jackpot Sit &amp; Go offering, which is available through ParionsSport en ligne, one of the online properties of the operator.</p>
<p>ParionsSport en ligne is the go-to sports betting and casino brand for the FDJ, and it will now be expanding tentatively into poker, with France experiencing a big upsurge in the demand for the game similarly to other countries in the region, such as Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>FDJ is committed to growing its presence in the French iGaming market across all available verticals and adding a poker product is a clear step forward towards this ultimate goal. FDJ Group Head of Sports Betting and Poker Richard Courtois has said that the Group was pleased with the addition of the new range of games. He said that this is precisely something that players have been asking for:</p>
<p>"They’ll be able to use the ParionsSport en ligne app to enjoy a recreational poker range that is designed for all types of players."</p>
<p>Courtois confirmed that through this move, FDJ Group is able to considerably grow its presence in the online gaming market and ensure that it is continuing to drive growth and innovation. However, the company remains equally committed to maintaining a responsible and fun gaming environment for all.</p>
<p>FDJ is effectively joining the iPoker Network by Playtech, which has been gathering momentum in Europe. The network has had successes in other countries as well, including Italy. Lottomatica decided to join the iPoker Network in Italy last week, marking the latest expansion for Playtech’s solution.</p>
<p>FDJ is planning to further expand its poker offering and network in 2023. Effectively, the Group wants to go ahead and launch with every single form of poker that is currently approved by the ANJ, the country’s gambling regulator. Besides Jackpot Sit &amp; Go, FDJ intends to add regular Sit &amp; Go options, cash games and MTTs.</p>
<p>There will soon be a dedicated poker app for people who want to jump straight to the poker action, with the download available on the ParionsSport en ligne’s official web page. Poker is steadily gathering momentum in Europe.</p>
