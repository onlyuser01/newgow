<p>Hello! I made a deposit at this casino, but it did not come. I guess what is the problem. I sent USD tether trc20 to a TRX address. I provided all the evidence. Screenshot of a check from Binance. Screenshot of the deposit page from the casino where the TRX address is indicated. I understand that I was in a hurry and sent usdtt to the trx address. But this address is received by any token in the TRC20 network, since the address is the same for all. Accordingly, the TRX address can also accept usdTT. The tech support guy is trying to scam me. Perhaps due to lack of knowledge. He writes complete nonsense in which a normal adequate person will not believe. Roughly speaking, they took my deposit from me and do not want to credit it. What reasonable person would believe this?</p>
<p>"if you send usdt via TRX adress. It doesnt actually convert into TRX and comes a to TRX. What actually happens is that USDT goes to some USDT adress which is not under our contor and nobody can even tell that it exists"</p>
