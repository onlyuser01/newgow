    <h1>Bossier City Casinos Hollywood Casino Kansas City Parker Az Casino The Mirage Hotel And Casino In La</h1>

<p>Most likely, your observations just happened to coincide with that moment. Such long series (or even longer) of hits or misses don't occur more frequently than in regular casinos.</p>
<p>I have now reviewed the statistics of several tables, and to support my words, I'm providing a few images. Firstly, the last 1000 numbers that came up in roulette.</p>
<p>As you can visually confirm, there aren't very long series there.</p>
<p>Then I looked at column charts for each category (red/black, even/odd, small/large), where the green color represents a group of consecutive hits of the required category, and red indicates consecutive misses.</p>
<p>In the case of red numbers, you can see that the green and red bars are not very high. Which means, there were no long sequences of misses or hits of red numbers. Using the scroll feature (marked with an arrow), I reviewed the entire game history (those same 1000 spins), and the maximum I could find was 12 misses of red in a row.</p>
<p>I examined several roulette tables, and the situation was similar everywhere. I didn't take screenshots because it wouldn't make sense.</p>
<p>Of course, there are situations when red or green bars are very high, but my example simply shows that this doesn't happen more often than anywhere else.</p>
