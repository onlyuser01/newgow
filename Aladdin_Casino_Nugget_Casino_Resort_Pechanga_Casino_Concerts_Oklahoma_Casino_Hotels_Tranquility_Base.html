<p>SBC has announced that four industry veterans will be inaugurated in the SBC Hall of Fame during the official event ceremony, ahead of the upcoming SBC Summit Barcelona 2023. The event, which is taking place at the W Hotel, Barcelona on September 19, and is part of the SBC Leaders Summit, will see several individuals distinguished.</p>
<p>SBC Summit Barcelona 2023 itself is being held at the Fira Barcelona Montjuïc between September 19 and September 21. The four individuals have already been handpicked by the jury and they will become a part of the prominent circle of distinguished industry professionals based on merit and their contributions in their respective fields and areas of expertise. The four people in question are:</p>
<p>Gustaf Hagman (CEO and Co-Founder, LeoVegas)</p>
<p>(CEO and Co-Founder, LeoVegas) Jordan Levin (CEO, OpenBet)</p>
<p>(CEO, OpenBet) Per Widerström (Incoming CEO, 888 Holdings*)</p>
<p>(Incoming CEO, 888 Holdings*) Brigid Simmonds OBE (Chair, Betting and Gaming Council)</p>
<p>The Hall of Fame was originally launched in 2016 and it celebrates those individuals who have notable contributions to the entire sector, and specifically sports betting. Commenting on the opportunity to introduce yet another prominent quarter of inductees, SBC VP of Growth and Strategy, Americas Sue Schneider said:</p>
<p>"This is an occasion that will forever remain in the hearts of the inductees. It's an opportunity for us, as an industry, to take a moment and recognize the incredible work they've done - from pioneering the concept of mobile-first betting to guiding companies through cultural transformations, mergers and acquisitions, and establishing ethical standards in the industry."</p>
<p>The four new additions join other classmates from 2023, including Michael Gaughan (Owner, South Point Hotel Casino Spa), Nick Bogdanovich (Sportsbook Manager/Oddsmaker, Circa Sports), Trish Lewandowski (Sportsbook District Manager, Caesars Digital), and David L. Rebuck (Director, NJ Department of Gaming Enforcement).</p>
<p>These individuals were inducted during the SBC Summit North American this past June. The SBC Leaders Summit is an exclusive invite-only industry gathering that is reuniting 450 C-level executives and offering a private environment in which they can network, talk, and exchange know-how and industry chatter.</p>
