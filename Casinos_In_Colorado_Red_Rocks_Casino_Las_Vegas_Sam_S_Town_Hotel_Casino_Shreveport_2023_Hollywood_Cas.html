<p>Canada’s Loto-Québec has expanded its offering by adding live casino games created by one of the world’s most reputable live online casino game providers – Evolution Gaming. This is yet another huge achievement for Evolution after it recently announced that its yearly revenue has topped $1 billion.</p>
<p>The Live Casino Games Will Be Hosted at Casino Montreal</p>
<p>Casino Montreal, which is owned by Loto-Québec, will serve as the host ground for the new Evolution titles and hence, the partnership between the two parties will strengthen even more. This latest deal will allow Evolution and Loto-Québec to combine online and land-based games.</p>
<p>Online and in-person players will be able to enjoy the new games. Evolution stated that its Dual Play games allow a convergence as online players and players at the venue itself are able to play the featured titles alongside each other and thus, have the best gaming experience.</p>
<p>Evolution’s commercial director for North America, Jeff Millar, stated that live casino games act as a “natural bridge between land-based and online” and thanks to Evolution’s Dual Play feature, the provider found a way to develop a product for land-based casinos who are looking to explore the possibilities of the online world.</p>
<p>Dual Play is a product by Evolution that allows roulette and baccarat tables to be enjoyed by players at the premises of the casino where the game is hosted, as well as players that want to enjoy these games online. Dual Play Baccarat and Dual Play Roulette are the two types of games offered by this product. Additionally, these Dual Play tables can be deployed as B2C or B2B.</p>
<p>Evolution and Loto-Québec Started Collaborating in 2019</p>
<p>Back in 2019, Evolution and Loto-Québec went off on their first venture as the Canadian lottery operator expanded its iGaming offering with 6 branded tables by Evolution. According to the deal, these live games were broadcasted from the Vancouver production studio.</p>
<p>Five of the six table games were hosted by dealers speaking French. Sovanna Phan, online product manager of Lotoquebec.com, the platform where these games were featured, stated that the strategy to combine both land-based and online players fits the glove of the company.</p>
<p>James Stern, the then-chief business officer for land-based and American gaming, stated that the service that Evolution will be providing to Lottoquebec.com is a testament to the provider’s vast experience in live casino solutions.</p>
<p>Back then, Evolution was the only licensed live casino supplier in the country and Lottoquebec.com became the second iGaming platform to operate out of the Evolution site in Vancouver. The Vancouver site opened in February 2018 and the first platform to operate out of that site was the British Columbia Lottery Corporation.</p>
