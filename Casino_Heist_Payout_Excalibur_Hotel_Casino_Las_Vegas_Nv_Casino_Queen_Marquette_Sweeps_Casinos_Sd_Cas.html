<p>Marking a Big Raceway Milestone for Betway</p>
<p>As the name implies, the race was organized to celebrate an important milestone for the Super Group brand: its 4000th horse race sponsorship in the UK and Ireland. The race featured a free racing game called “4 To Win” with a bonus jackpot of $18,500. The bonus was shared by the winners of the race.</p>
<p>Betway CEO Anthony Werkman called the milestone “fantastic.” In November, the bookmaker managed to reach another noteworthy milestone: its 1,000th sponsored race at Newcastle. This was the largest number of races to ever be sponsored by a UK-based bookmaker at any racecourse.</p>
<p>Betway began its impressive stream of British horse racing event sponsorships in 2015. In January, they sponsored the event at Ffos Las and continued to expand their portfolio with close to 30 racecourses ever since. The group expressed its desire to continue to expand and provide its support while giving thanks to all persons and organizations that have made this amazing landmark possible.</p>
<p>Betway remains the official betting partner of the Grand National Festival, as well as the sponsor of the Queen Mother Champion Chase and a category sponsor of three All-Weather Championships divisions: Sprint, Middle Distance, and Marathon.</p>
<p>Betway’s Partnerships Span All Sport</p>
<p>Betway’s footprint has been expanding rapidly. While the 4000th horse race sponsorship in the UK is a huge milestone, it’s hardly the only one the Super Group-owned brand is working on. Earlier this year, the company sponsored the Stockholm Open, a tennis competition, and is committed to the Rio Open for the 2022/2023 season in November.</p>
<p>The brand has found success in the newly-regulated sports betting market in the United States, signing significant sports franchises, such as the Philadelphia 76ers, Miami Heat, and the Dallas Mavericks, benefiting from each team’s exposure in their respective markets.</p>
