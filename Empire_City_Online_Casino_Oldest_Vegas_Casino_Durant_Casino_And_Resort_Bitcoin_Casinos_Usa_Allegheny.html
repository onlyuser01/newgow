<p>The Detroit Lions vs. Kansas City Chiefs is the season opener to the 2023 NFL. The game is taking place on Thursday, September 7, at Arrowhead in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions have big ambitions for the 2023 NFL season, hoping to make the playoffs for the first time in 2016 when they got themselves to the Wild Card round. They’re projected to pull it off, but they’re not expected to start their 2023 campaign with a win. The reason is obvious – in Week 1, they’re taking on the reigning champions the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead.</p>

<p>Arrowhead is Kansas City Chiefs’ Impenetrable Fortress</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl last season and are favored to do it again. They went 14-3 in the regular season in 2023, and are expected to do something similar this year as well. What’s interesting is that last year, we saw them lose only one game on their turf. It happened against the Buffalo Bills in October 2022, with the final score being 24-20 for the visitors.</p>
<p>Speaking of their performances at Arrowhead, they’ve got a 100% record against the Detroit Lions. These two have met three times in KC so far, and the hosts won each time. However, all three of those happened in the pre-Patrick Mahomes era.</p>
<p>With him as their signal-caller, the Chiefs look more dangerous than they’ve been in a while. But it’s not just about Mahomes; most of their key men from the Super Bowl-winning season are on the roster. One of them, however, will miss the season opener.</p>
<p>The man in question is Travis Kelce, who’s generally considered to be the best tight end in the league. Last year, he was the Chiefs’ receiving yards leader, as well as the man with the most receiving TDs. Due to a problem with his knee, Kelce will miss the Lions at Chiefs game on Thursday; how will his team cope without him?</p>
<p>Lines Moving in Detroit Lions Direction</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions aren’t a very good team, but they’re expected to make the playoffs this year. The reason for this is that they’re playing in a division that’s not too tough. It’s the NFC North we’re talking about, a division where the Lions are placed together with the Green Bay Packers who are playing their first season without Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback. The Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears are also there, two teams that don’t seem stronger than Detroit.</p>
<p>Sure, the Lions were pretty disappointing last season, but their roster was young and experienced. This time, they look much sharper in the offense and much more reliable in the defense. Their starting quarterback for the third straight season is Jared Goff, but this year, the Lions also have a pretty decent backup QB in Teddy Bridgewater.</p>
<p>They’ve also drafted a couple of good offensive players, but it’s their defense that looks much better than in 2022. The big question is it good enough to stop Mahomes &amp; Co?</p>
<p>Lions at Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>There’s no way the Kansas City Chiefs can lose to the Detroit Lions, especially not at Arrowhead. Sure, they’re without one of their key men, but we think coach Andy Reid will come up with a solution that will bring the Super Bowl winners a win in Week 1. However, we don’t think it’s going to be an easy win. In fact, we think they might not win by more than a touchdown difference.</p>
