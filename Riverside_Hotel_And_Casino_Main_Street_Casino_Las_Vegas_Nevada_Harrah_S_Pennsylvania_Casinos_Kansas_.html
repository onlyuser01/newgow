<p>Yggdrasil and BoyleSports have signed an important distribution deal covering several territories across Ireland and the UK</p>
<p>Last May, the Irish sports betting group announced the start of a major expansion for its retail betting network in Great Britain, with 20 pending stores as part of the plan. At the time of the announcement, BoyleSports was already counting 25 stores in Britain.</p>
<p>Now, BoyleSports has agreed to a fresh multi-territory distribution agreement for the UK and Ireland alongside Yggdrasil. The latter was recently awarded the prestigious Innovator of the Year Award at the International Gaming Awards 2023 for its contributions to the online gaming industry.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s Slots to Go Live in the UK and Ireland</p>
<p>According to the new deal, the popular gaming content publisher with a declared purpose to accelerate innovation in iGaming will have its rich portfolio of premium slot games go live across Ireland and the UK. The list will include a series of highly popular slots, such as Valley of the Gods, the Vikings series, and a number of games that incorporate Yggdrasil’s innovative Game Engagement Mechanics (GEM).</p>
<p>Accordingly, games like Dragon Blox GigaBlox and Raptor DoubleMax will become available to BoyleSports’ customers. One of the freshest Yggdrasil slots that incorporates the same GEM is Elysian Jackpots. The 5×3 reel slot is a FastPot5 GEM game packed with both local and progressive jackpots up for grabs.</p>
<p>BoyleSports, Eager to Work with Yggdrasil</p>
<p>While allowing BoyleSports to introduce Yggdrasil’s leading content and excellent portfolio to its live customers, the deal will enable the developer to expand its foothold in these well-established markets in Europe. At the same time, Yggdrasil will continue to strengthen its leading role as a pioneering provider of slot games in iGaming.</p>
<p>The provider is also getting ready to celebrate its 10th year of existence this year, making its plans to enrich its portfolio and extend its foothold in new territories even more suitable.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new deal, Yggdrasil’s chief commercial operations officer, Andrew Pegler, expressed excitement. He described their new partner as “an incredibly well-known brand across the UK and other regulated markets” with a big focus on the future, which is exactly what Yggdrasil is searching for when adding new partners to its roster.</p>
<p>BoyleSports’ gaming director, Steve Payne, spoke about Yggdrasil’s “proud history” of developing state-of-the-art games of slots that have turned into fan favorites overnight while expressing their delight to take their leading content live on their platforms in Ireland and the UK. Payne added that BoyleSports was prepared to carry on the collaboration for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The company has had a constant presence in the Irish and British markets for the last four decades, after establishing itself as one of the most reputable online and retail operators.</p>
