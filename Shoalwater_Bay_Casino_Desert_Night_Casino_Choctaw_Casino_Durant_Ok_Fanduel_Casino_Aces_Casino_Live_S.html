    <h1>Shoalwater Bay Casino Desert Night Casino Choctaw Casino Durant Ok Fanduel Casino Aces Casino Live S</h1>

<p>The new company of FanDuel co-founders Nigel Eccles and Rob Jones, Flick, successfully completed a $5 million in Series A funding, to support the further growth of its app for sports influencers. The new round of funding is the second for the company, after the initial $4 million it raised in 2018.</p>
<p>Flick which was found in 2018 is based in Scotland, and has been growing steadily in the past few months, one of its founders, Rob Jones, pointed out. The company’s user base is expanding at a 45% month-on-month rate while engagement in the same period is growing 10 times, he added.</p>
<p>Platform For Sports Fans and Influencers</p>
<p>The company’s live chat feature allows engagement for sports influencers with sports fans during games, providing them with a place to grow and foster a loyal fan base with their own brand space. Flick is the “future of sports entertainment”, Nigel Eccles explained.</p>
<p>“Flick creates a virtual sports bar experience, bringing fans together to hang out for live games, letting them chat, cheer and compete with each other. It creates the sense of community and excitement that we’re all missing at the moment.” Nigel Eccles, Co-Founder, Flick</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Alley Corp, the founder and funder of companies in New York, with the participation of some of its previous investors such as Bullpen Capital, Everblue Management, Amity Ventures, Courtside VC and others. Alley Corp will have another contribution, as Kevin Ryan, a serial entrepreneur and founder and CEO at Alley Corp is set to join the board of directors at Flick.</p>
<p>“It is rare in venture to find people like Nigel and Rob who are such proven entrepreneurs with deep experience and expertise in the market they are addressing. We are excited to join them as they build out the company.” Kevin Ryan, Founder and CEO, Alley Corp</p>
<p>Funding Will Support Sports Betting Expansion</p>
<p>The funding will be used to support the growth of the company as it comes during times when people are seeking alternative ways to be part of a community, due to the disconnect caused by the virus outbreak and restriction measures. This is particularly valid for sports fans who are not being allowed to attend live games and want to keep up the banter with friends and other fans.</p>
<p>“With the new round of funding, the company plans to expand its team, integrate with sports betting, and build out the platform across multiple sports and geographies.” Nigel Eccles, Co-Founder, Flick</p>
<p>Sports betting exploded in the US, but remains more of a transactional experience, Eccles continued, pointing out that the expansion of Flick into sports betting would seek to change that and make wagering more exciting that simply paying a bill on a banking app.</p>
