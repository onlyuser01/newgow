<p>Barstool Sportsbook’s email to a bettor suspending his account for not using it for recreational activities went viral after the man posted the email and a video of his rant on Twitter.</p>
<p>Barstool Sportsbook Received a Backlash on Twitter</p>
<p>Twitter users are furious at Barstool Sportsbook, the sports betting app by Barstool Sports, after an email from a customer of the app went viral. On Thursday, May 13, @JoeyKnish22 posted the email on Twitter, which showed how Barstool Sportsbook told him he could not bet on their promotional bets, which often include enhanced odds. These bets are “intended for recreational members to explore betting on various sports and markets,” not for customers “who show non-recreational tendencies.”</p>
<p>The user posted a video on the social media platform with his rant against Barstool, stating that they banned him “for winning too much.”</p>
<p>Barstool Didn’t Respond Officially</p>
<p>In the email, the company stated that it had made an update to the user’s account. It states that Barstool Sportsbook and the casino promotions are intended for recreational members to explore betting on various sports and markets. The platform is not for users who do not want to use it for recreational purposes.</p>
<p>In the email, the company also stated that based on the user’s past sports betting history, the team has decided that the account will not be used for recreational purposes. The company wrote the user that their player account is no longer eligible for Barstool Sportsbook &amp; Casino promotions and events.</p>
<p>Barstool Sportsbook has yet to respond to @JoeyKnish22’s allegations. It is also not yet clear how many other users have had a similar experience with the sportsbook.</p>
<p>Barstool Sportsbook to Become Available In 10 States</p>
<p>In January 2020, Penn National Gaming bought a 36% stake in Barstool Sports, an online medium with thousands of fans. Barstool Sportsbook first went live in Pennsylvania. In its first weekend, it was downloaded more than 63,000 times.</p>
<p>Owned by Penn National Gaming, Barstool Sportsbook recently launched in Illinois in time for March Madness. The company is currently live in Illinois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In February, the CEO of Penn National Gaming, Jay Snowden, said he wants to have the app up and running in 10 states by the start of the NFL season. The goal is to make it available in Tennesse, Colorado, Iowa, Virginia, and New Jersey, among others.</p>
<p>Penn experienced massive growth last year and reported strong revenue, coming from EBITDA margins and the app Barstool Sportsbook in Pennsylvania. The company looks forward to rolling it out in more states this year.</p>
