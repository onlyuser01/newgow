    <h1>All Inclusive Resorts With Casinos Arizona Casinos Casino In Dallas Empire City Casino How To Win At</h1>

<p>I opened a Mystake account on 22.12.2021. and immediately verified it. On 19. 03. 2022 at their request, I verified the account a second time.</p>
<p>On 12. September 2022, in the early hours of the morning, I requested a withdrawal of €2,300, leaving a balance of €1,271.98.</p>
<p>Around noon I found that my account was blocked. I asked them in a letter, and they answered me:</p>
<p>'Your account is under investigation, for now, it may take up to 6 months'.</p>
<p>It is important to note that I also have an account in Freshbet, which is owned by a different owner, but the two operators - Mystake and Freshbet have the same management. Nowhere, in anyone's rules, does it say that maintaining accounts in both places is a violation.</p>
<p>In Freshbet, my account was also blocked on 12. September. There I got a video verification request on their scenario. I did right away and sent them this video. I received confirmation in a letter that the video was approved, but was also told to wait 6 months because the account was 'under investigation'.</p>
<p>With them, my balance is smaller and the case with Freshbet is not the subject of the present complaint.</p>
<p>I have 20+ years of experience in online gambling, but I never even thought that such actions by an operator were possible. Through Googling, I found this to be common practice for Mystake, so I was patient.</p>
<p>So, 6 months have passed with only one change in the situation:</p>
<p>Mystake no longer accept players from my country and even their site is inaccessible to me - when typing their URL, I get an "Access denied" message.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, this "investigation" should have been completed in 6 months.</p>
<p>On March 7 of this year I sent them a letter reminding them about my blocked account and asking them to tell me how I could withdraw my balance and end our relationship. I have no answer, silence...</p>
<p>I have the necessary screenshots to confirm what I said and can provide them to Casino Guru upon request.</p>
<p>I am asking the Casino Guru team to help me get in touch with a Mystake representative to confirm the completion of this "investigation" and guide me on how to withdraw my balance from their inaccessible site.</p>
