<p>Explore Space With Courageous Anna the Astronaut!</p>
<p>Players with a fascination for outer space and space exploration will be delighted to discover Lucky Lady Games’ freshest release. Astro Anna features excellent space-themed graphics with carefully designed symbols representative of a pipe that can bring together between two and four sides of a square it lands on, connecting to a different pipe in nearby squares. When the pipes manage to spin in a full connection to the sides of the grid, players receive a reward. The slot also features random multipliers. When these multipliers are seen landing on the pipes, they automatically boost the win provided they reach the connected pipe.</p>
<p>Up to 50x Sticky Multiplier during Bonus Game</p>
<p>Astro Anna comes with a Free Spins bonus round that can be engaged when four, five, or six prizes are connected in a single round. This brings players 10, 15, or 20 Free Spins. Triggering seven, eight, nine, or ten prizes during a single spin also attracts a multiplier of up to 20x. The sticky multiplier is added on top of the original multiplier seen on the counter when accessing the Free Spins Round. The multiplier can go as high as 50x during the bonus game.</p>
<p>LL Lucky Games AB’s chief executive officer and co-founder Mads Jørgensen spoke about the new game that is a “fourth exclusive release in a row” for their ComeOn! partners. Jørgensen also expressed their thrill regarding the “fruitful collaboration” with the successful operator, calling the slot a “highly entertaining game” capable of satisfying “everyone’s thirst.”</p>
<p>ComeOn!’s head of exclusive games referred to the game that also features a Buy Bonus option as a “very intriguing” one with the potential to bring “hours of entertainment” for players via Slot Matrix.</p>
<p>In mid-October, Norwegian operator Norsk Tipping announced it would introduce LL Lucky Games AB’s games on its platform with the help of International Game Technology. The studio also signed a content distributor deal with CYG Pte Ltd during the same month.</p>
