    <h1>Hollywood Casino Indiana Buffalo Bills Casino Primm Hotels Near Soaring Eagle Casino Michigan Casino</h1>

<p>Using their powerful synergy, the S&amp;P 500 global gaming and entertainment company and the leading sports betting and iGaming operator have created a unique slot experience for US players.</p>
<p>Called MGM Riches, the slot game will enable players to engage in both online gameplay using BetMGM‘s iCasino platform available in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, and classic slot machine gameplay at the 15 MGM Resorts venues spread across the country. West Virginia is also pending release in the near future.</p>
<p>MGM Riches Created Together with Everi</p>
<p>The new multi-level game is the result of the collaboration between the two giants and NYSE-listed Everi Holdings, the popular supplier of technology solutions aimed at casino floors.</p>
<p>MGM Riches features two separate themes: MGM Riches Triple Ruby and MGM Riches 5x Sapphire. Players will enjoy consistent and engaging gameplay no matter which alternative they might select, according to MGM Resorts International’s senior vice president of slot strategy Mike Gatten.</p>
<p>Gatten further explained the new game has been created with loyal players’ experience at the core, in an attempt to allow them to enjoy their preferred games and cash in their rewards even if they are not physically present at one of their properties.</p>
<p>BetMGM, “Thrilled” to Offer the Pioneer Slot</p>
<p>BetMGM’s vice president of gaming Angus Nisbet spoke about the launch of MGM Riches, expressing their thrill about being able to offer the “first-of-its-kind slot” while continuing to generate innovative content.</p>
<p>Nisbet has also explained that the new game will reunite BetMGM’s online casino offerings with MGM Resorts’ beloved destinations. Among them, MGM Resorts’ MGM National Harbor located in Oxon Hill, Maryland, which is currently the most profitable property located outside of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>While leveraging the omnichannel integration of both MGM Resorts and BetMGM, loyal members part of the MGM Rewards and BetMGM Rewards programs will be given the chance to earn Tier Credits with every new spin. The credits can be earned via both channels and the perks will be unlocked and redeemed later on at any MGM Resorts located in the US.</p>
<p>Players Can Qualify for Exclusive Member-Only Experiences</p>
<p>Ranging from access to exclusive sporting events, concerts, gaming tournaments, or the yearly Holiday Gift Shoppe experience, members will enjoy a variety of perks.</p>
<p>They will also be given the opportunity to transfer BetMGM Rewards points to MGM Rewards points and redeem them in exchange for free hotel accommodation, complimentary diners, and additional entertainment at various locations including Borgata in Atlantic City, Bellagio, and ARIA in Las Vegas, or MGM Grand Detroit located in Michigan.</p>
<p>Everi’s executive vice president of sales, marketing, and digital, David Lucchese, called the creation of MGM Riches “another example of MGM Resorts’ and BetMGM’s focus on patron engagement” while also using it to showcase Everi’s capacity to offer exciting gaming experiences created for omnichannel players.</p>
<p>Just like the rest of Everi’s close to 70 games, MGM Riches will be delivered with the help of their top-tier proprietary Spark Remote Game Server.</p>
