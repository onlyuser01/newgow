    <h1>Winstar Casino Map Wild Casino Online Ms Gulf Coast Casinos Gulfport Casino Hotels Casino Laughlin B</h1>

<p>Good evening Nick</p>
<p>In essence, my account was already verified, with all the relevant personal documents, but when I requested a withdrawal in the early hours of the 29th to the 30th, stress was created in my head.</p>
<p>The support is rude, an attendant wrote to me: "Unfortunately I don't speak your language and I am forced to use the translator to assist you."</p>
<p>Then I, as a customer, already have this problem and the support, which should be the calming channel, contrary to what was proposed, inflames the situation.</p>
<p>Then a "Ticket #K83YY: PROOF OF TRANSACTIONS IN THE NAME OF THE OWNER" started and never ended. I was advised to request the withdrawal again, and it was denied 4 times in a row.</p>
<p>I sent ALL THE PROOF, among them, there was 1 transfer that came from my daughter's bank account, only 1! And I sent this proof, as well as the documents that prove our relationship, which is no reason for them to withhold my money.</p>
<p>Can my daughter request a withdrawal? They will claim that she does not own the account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are talking about AN ISOLATED DEPOSIT, worth 30 reais, which I can prove its origin, the system in this house is shameful.</p>
<p>I have registration in other houses, and I will take the liberty of mentioning the "Only" one that has the policy of only making withdrawals to the CPF of those who also made the deposit, that is, there is consistency of information, and if I make a deposit on behalf of third parties, they refund.</p>
<p>Why did 20Bet only bother when paying? So the incoming transfer money could be fraudulent, but when it came to paying, did they follow the ethics board?</p>
<p>And what kind of casino is this, that keeps charging proof of each deposit that was wagered???? I have never seen this, and I have registered with many foreign houses, which carry out the verification and it is valid and works.</p>
<p>In short, everything requested was sent, but they say that some corner of the file is unreadable, IMPOSSIBLE, the receipts are official from the banks, and they asked me to "print"... you know?! WTF?!?!</p>
<p>Imagine if it was a hefty amount, but we're talking about 50 reais, and I've already left a lot more at the house.</p>
<p>Then I see some procedures, where people enter the Casino, with other people's data, take 60 thousand or more, moving 5, 6 accounts at the same time, and the ease is terrible... but ME, I can't get 50 real.</p>
<p>Bad service, ineffective procedures, unprepared staff, for it to be bad they would still have to improve a lot. I have parameters to evaluate Casino's procedure, and I dare to say that this aggressive and unreasonable verification has more to do with their dishonesty than with mine.</p>
<p>Okay, you already have reading for the rest of the week. haha ha</p>
<p>Hug</p>
