<p>Gaming and betting industry leader, Caesars Entertainment, announced that its flagship sports wagering platform, Caesars Sportsbook, has gone live in Massachusetts. The company confirmed last week that its platform is available for bettors in the state via iOS and Android devices, as well as desktop computers.</p>
<p>It was back in August 2022 when the Bay State legalized sports wagering. Then, on January 31, 2023, the state introduced retail sports wagering. This was followed by a launch of the legal mobile wagering market that was completed on March 10, 2023. Coinciding with the launch of the market, Caesars Sportsbook has gone live in the state as well.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent launch, customers in Massachusetts will be able to benefit from the company's leading loyalty program, Caesars Rewards. Bets they place with the mobile app grant bettors Tier Credits that add up to the bettor's status. Additionally, players can also earn Rewards Credits that can be exchanged for unique Caesars Rewards experiences such as getaways with a discount and other benefits.</p>
<p>Celebrating the launch in Massachusetts, Caesars introduced a special sign-up offer valid for first-time users, a statement reveals. To gain advantage of the offer, users need to register, deposit funds and sign up using a promo code CZR1BET and place their first bet. If that wager turns out to be a loss, Caesars promises "one Bonus Bet equal to the amount of your first wager up to $1,500."</p>
<p>As with any state where Caesars Sportsbook is available, customers in Massachusetts will be able to benefit from the application's fast payouts, user-friendly features as well as different deposit options. Moreover, bettors will have the option to choose from a variety of markets that include real-time play-by-play and in-play betting options.</p>
<p>Besides the mobile sports wagering app, Caesars plans to expand the presence of its Caesars Sportsbook further. The company confirmed its plans to introduce retail sports wagering, as well as mobile account cash deposit options at Raynham Park, located near Boston. Still, according to the company, this launch remains contingent on approval from the gambling regulator in the state, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>The temporary sportsbook at the location is expected open at some point this spring. Then, at a later period, the sportsbook is expected to expand to a 30,000-square-foot location, making it one of the biggest pari-mutuel simulcasting and sports betting locations in the country.</p>
<p>Eric Hession, Caesars Digital's President, shared his excitement about the recent launch saying: "With the sports calendar gaining momentum and multiple Massachusetts teams having remarkable seasons, it’s a great time to bring a new entertainment experience to sports fans in the Commonwealth."</p>
<p>Finally, he pointed out: "Caesars Sportsbook is primed to deliver a best-in-class sports wagering experience to Massachusetts sports fans, and we’d like to thank the Massachusetts Gaming Commission for approving our expansion into the Bay State."</p>
