<p>Fulham Football Club, the globally-recognized professional football team based in Fulham, London, England, announced a new sponsorship agreement. Earlier this week, the football club confirmed it joined forces with the leading global online gaming operator, SBOTOP, for new sponsorship.</p>
<p>The new collaboration, described as a record sponsorship deal for the football club, designates the gambling operator as its Front of Shirt and Principal Partner. Although financial details regarding the agreement were not disclosed, the duo confirmed that it will be valid for the 2023-24 season. As a result, SBOTOP will benefit from brand exposure via the team's training kit sleeve and the Men's First Team kit.</p>
<p>Jon Don-Carolis, Fulham FC's Commercial Director, shared his excitement about the new collaboration in a statement. "We are pleased to welcome SBOTOP as our Front of Shirt partner as we continue our exciting journey in the Premier League," he said. Finally, Don-Carolis noted: "The coveted front-of-shirt sponsorship plays an integral part in keeping the Club competitive through significant revenue, and we look forward to celebrating continued success in 2023/24."</p>
<p>Bill Mummery, SBOTOP's Chief Executive Officer, shared Don-Carolis' excitement and said: "We are delighted and excited to bring our two 'Premier Brands' together." He predicted that the collaboration will bring benefits for the company, as well as the football club and help engage with new fans. Finally, Mummery pointed out: "I wish Fulham an enjoyable and rewarding trip to the USA."</p>
<p>Fulham FC officially launches its kit on Friday, June 30, 2023, which also marks the start of the activation with SBOTOP. The company will benefit from brand exposure during the pre-season as well. Additionally, SBOTOP will be able to engage with Premier League's global audience thanks to the front-of-shirt logo and in-stadium brand presence.</p>
<p>News about the new sponsorship between SBOTOP and Fulham FC comes after only recently, another leading football team signed a deal with a gambling operator. Aston Villa, the famous Premier League professional football club confirmed a new shirt sponsorship deal with BK8, a leading gaming and sports betting operator.</p>
<p>Under the terms of that deal, BK8 was designated as the new Principal and Front of Shirt Partner for the football club. The term of the new agreement is set through the end of the 2025/26 season. In addition to sponsoring the football club, BK8 confirmed its commitment to helping local charities in Birmingham.</p>
