<p>The lotteries in three US states have awarded record jackpots thanks to the company's leading progressive jackpot technology</p>
<p>The provider of eInstant games for lotteries, Instant Win Gaming (IWG), confirmed that since the start of the year, multiple record progressive jackpot prizes were awarded. The company said in a statement released Thursday that the Virginia Lottery, the New Hampshire Lottery, as well as the Michigan Lottery, had a stellar start of the year, awarding record-setting progressive jackpot prizes for the first two months of 2023.</p>
<p>IWG explained that the jackpots reaffirm the potential of the company’s progressive jackpot-powered games that deliver unique chances for high prizes to lottery customers around the US. Moreover, the announcement about the record jackpot prizes comes after a major prize was secured recently, in October. Back then, the Pennsylvania Lottery via IWG’s Big Keystone Jackpot eInstant awarded a $1.6 million jackpot.</p>
<p>The Supplier’s Presence in North America Grows</p>
<p>IWG’s CEO, Rhydian Fisher, congratulated the lotteries in Virginia, New Hampshire and Michigan for the record awards from the company’s eInstant progressive jackpots. He explained that the company is excited to continue to increase the reach of its leading products. Moreover, Fisher explained that by now, IWG has launched more than 70 progressive eInstant jackpots for North America.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to Michigan, New Hampshire, and Virginia lotteries for each setting eInstant progressive jackpot records.“ Rhydian Fisher, CEO at IWG</p>
<p>Fisher pointed out that the company’s progressive jackpot games help build the company’s experience which in turn improves the products for lottery players. “What I love about all these record-setting jackpots is that they leverage the combination of IWG game styles and technologies to drive this excitement,” he said.</p>
<p>According to him, the different technologies, such as InstantBoost and InstantJackpot, to name a few, meet the requirements of different lotteries. In conclusion, Fisher said that IWG is looking forward to seeing further growth in its products throughout 2023.</p>
<p>“It’s very exciting and we look forward to growing the jackpot category further in 2023.“ added Fisher</p>
<p>It was back in January when the Michigan Lottery, via its Monthly Jackpot second chance jackpot eInstant, awarded a record prize of $403,618. The game itself receives funding from a percentage of the sales and leverages IWG’s leading InstantReplay technology.</p>
<p>Then, in February, the Virginia Lottery awarded a record $785,414 jackpot prize from its Commonwealth Jackpot eInstants. Another progressive jackpot prize was awarded near the end of February by the New Hampshire Lottery. One lucky player that participated in the Lottery’s Premier Jackpot game, powered by IWG’s InstantBoost, secured a record-breaking $392,703 prize.</p>
