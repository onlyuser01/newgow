<p>The announcement comes in line with the legalization of betting and the expected launch of the legal market in the state planned for next year</p>
<p>The leading marketing affiliate for online sports betting and casino in North America, Catena Media, hinted at plans for further US expansion on Monday. The company confirmed that it plans to launch within the sports betting market in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after sports betting was greenlighted in the state last week. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper signed legislation on Wednesday that enabled the statewide expansion of sports betting. Per the regulation, the North Carolina Lottery Commission (NCLC), was granted the right to award up to 12 interactive sports betting licenses for operators interested in offering their services in the state.</p>
<p>At the time, Gov. Cooper predicted that the sports betting legalization would help raise tax revenue, which in turn would benefit the state’s 10.7 million population. Moreover, he predicted that the activity will help bring in tax revenue “for generations to come” while at the same time creating new jobs within the sector.</p>
<p>Catena Media’s CEO, Michael Daly, welcomed the news about the approval of sports betting in North Carolina, complementing the company’s expansion strategy for the North American market. “As the ninth most populous US state and the 28th to legalize online sports betting, North Carolina has the potential to become a significant market for us,” he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Daly spoke about the healthy and competitive market which is expected to be established in North Carolina. He pointed out that this model can help other states that are exploring options for betting legalization. “Ultimately, states that are better attuned to consumer needs and dedicate room for flexibility to sportsbook operators will have more success than those that don’t,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“This positive news from North Carolina aligns with our strategic ambition to expand our North American presence.“ Michael Daly, CEO at Catena Media</p>
<p>Sports Betting Expands Further across the US</p>
<p>Thanks to the recently signed legislation, North Carolina became the latest US state to legalize mobile sports betting. This reaffirms the growing popularity of the activity and would enable eligible bettors in the state to place legal wagers once the market launches. Under the legislation, the state can go live online sports betting early next year, on January 8, 2024.</p>
<p>Still, the launch may also be pushed as far as mid-June. The final decision remains in the hands of the NCLC, which can set a specific date for the launch of the market.</p>
<p>Currently, Catena Media is positioned well to expand in North Carolina with its popular brands LegalSportsReport, as well as Lineups. To further boost its upcoming expansion, the company also considers different media partnerships.</p>
