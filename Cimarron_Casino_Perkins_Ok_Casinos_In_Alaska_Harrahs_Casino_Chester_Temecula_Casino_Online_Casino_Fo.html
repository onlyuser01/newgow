    <h1>Cimarron Casino Perkins Ok Casinos In Alaska Harrahs Casino Chester Temecula Casino Online Casino Fo</h1>

<p>Hi team ,</p>
<p>I really need your help with a withdrawl</p>
<p>problem and I am 100 % sure I am in my right to receive the fund ..let me explain my issue …</p>
<p>Actually it is concerning 3 casinos with I accessed after reading the good rating on Your site casino guru</p>
<p>it concerns</p>
<p>captain spin casino for a withdrawal of 4000</p>
<p>Casigo casino for a withdrawal of 4500 eur</p>
<p>Miami dice casino for an amount of 1800 eur</p>
<p>total amount 10300 eur</p>
<p>last weekend I was very lucky in wining above amounts in these 3 casino and I made the withdrawal after finishing the welcome bonus wager successfully</p>
<p>Monday and today all 3 casinos reacted with an email and all 3 send same email with next text :</p>
<p>Your account has been found to be in breach of clause 9 of the Promotional Terms associated with the welcome offer:</p>
<p>Clause 9 - The maximum bet allowed while the Welcome Bonus is in play is EUR 5. Should You bet higher than this while the Welcome bonus is in play, the Casino reserves the right to confiscate all winnings.</p>
<p>Therefore, your withdrawal has been canceled, your winnings have been confiscated and your deposit of EUR 300 has been returned to your gaming account.</p>
<p>let me tell you first of all : I am fully aware of not playing more than 5 eur when the bonus is active . You don’t need to point out that rule as I was playing with bets of 2,50 and 5 eur and I was continuous checking if the wager was completed during my play</p>
<p>I only played with 2,50</p>
<p>and 5 eur … again I was fully aware of the max play of 5 eur when bonus is active .</p>
<p>the reason why all 3 casinos found the breach of because of a game I played and won : the game is :big spinner</p>
<p>in this game I was betting the whole time 2,50 and 5 eur on autoplay…it is a game with a wheel of fortune which you can enter when you win a prize. Let me give you an example :</p>
<p>when betting 5 eur on auto play and you win for example 50 eur ,your 50 eur will be loaded in the wheel of fortune where if 2 of more scatters appear you can spin the wheel..only what happens is the bet doubles</p>
<p>to 10 eur and you cannot change that . It changes automatically to 10 eur and when your 50 eur you won in the downgame goes to zero , it again changes back to 5 eur .</p>
<p>same things happens when playing with 2,50 bet and when you win .. the spins at the wheel of fortune goes to 5 eur .. you cannot changes this . It changes back again to your initial betting when the funds at the top game drops to 0</p>
<p>you can see this your self by playing the game in demo and see what happens when your bet is 5 eur and you win Prize</p>
<p>Please check next link https://www.nederlandseonlinecasino.nl/casinospellen/online-gokkasten/big-spinner/</p>
<p>again I am fully aware of the maximim</p>
<p>bet of 5 eur when bonus is in play</p>
<p>the casinos should also be aware of this and we should be protected by this as our bet was not more than 5 eur</p>
<p>I really need you help in this and it is al lot of money . I can see that all three casinos have good rating here which was the reason I started to play</p>
<p>I hope the casinos also will investigate this and will notice that every player with intention to play max 5 eur at big spinner will be trapped by this.</p>
<p>above text is related to Miami dice casino</p>
<p>but I have exactly the same problem with</p>
<p>casigo casino for an amount of 4500</p>
<p>and Captain spins casino for an amount of 4000 eur</p>
<p>what I think is that the cooperate with each other as I received 3 times same email on same day for my rejection of my 3 withdrawls and I also think that it is the same person who has reviewed my withdrawals</p>
<p>dear casino guru , I hope you will do my best for me to help me receive my funds from these 3 casinos as it is a total of 10300 eur and my betting was never higher than 5 eur</p>
<p>I can send you all proof of you want and explain also</p>
<p>the problem of the big spinner game which you also can see on the acount game history and how the beating increased to 10 after winning with 5 eur bet</p>
<p>I really hope you will protect the player in this case as I noticed all 3 casinos have good ratings on your site</p>
<p>thanks and regards</p>
