<p>Coolbet players will “need to keep their cool” when playing the new games, Stakelogic said</p>
<p>Stakelogic will leverage its premium content to supply Coolbet with some of the hottest games in iGaming, allowing it to “turn up the heat.” In addition to slots, the operator will receive access to live casino content from Stakelogic Live.</p>
<p>Stakelogic jokingly said that Coolbet players will “need to keep their cool” when playing the provider’s exciting high-volatility video slots. The supplier boasts a rich portfolio of high-quality games and has something for everyone.</p>
<p>Ancient Egypt, the Wild West and fishing are just some of the themes covered by the provider’s cutting-edge titles. When playing with Stakelogic, players will find both familiar and innovative themes. Some of the company’s best slots include games such as Money Track 2, Greedy Fox, Bison Blocks, Eric’s Big Catch and the recently-launched Candyways Bonanza 3 Megaways.</p>
<p>In addition to these thrilling innovative slots, Stakelogic also provides a selection of more traditional fruit-themed games. If players prefer to fire the reels of a classic fruit machine, they can try out titles such as Big Runner Deluxe and Milti4Player.</p>
<p>Coolbet will also integrate a selection of Stakelogic Live’s best live table games. As a result, players will get to experience engaging live dealer experiences across games such as blackjack, roulette and game show-styled games.</p>
<p>Finally, Coolbet players will now be able to enjoy some of Stakelogic’s proprietary features, such as the Super Stake mechanic, which allows players to double their bet to increase the chance of triggering the bonus round.</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s acclaimed content was recently onboarded by Golden Palace and Betclic as well.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Are Happy about the Deal</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s sales manager, Neil Tanti, praised Coolbet as an amazing online gaming brand with a vast and loyal player base. Tanti said that Stakelogic’s content will surely solidify Coolbet’s position as an online leader.</p>
<p>That its players can now spin the reels on our classic and video slots will help it to pull further ahead from its rivals by providing its players with access to the most in-demand slots in the market right now. Neil Tanti, sales manager, Stakelogic</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Richard Walker, Stakelogic Live’s head of live casino, said that his company feels great to welcome Coolbet on board. Live casino is a very important vertical in the contemporary gaming industry, Walker said, adding that he is glad Coolbet selected Stakelogic’s live casino content in particular.</p>
<p>Live casino is hugely popular and it’s vital for operators to offer a wide selection of games from several providers. We are now considered a must-have live studio and we are thrilled that Coolbet has added our content to its lobby. Richard Walker, head of live casino, Stakelogic Live</p>
<p>Lastly, Coolbet’s president, Endre Nesset, said that his team is delighted to have found a partner that “meets the needs” of Coolbet’s audience. He praised Stakelogic as a developer of great games that will greatly diversify Coolbet’s content offering.</p>
<p>Stakelogic is adding creative and vibrant games to our vast portfolio of casino content. We are super excited to offer its games to our players for the first time. Endre Nesset, president, Coolbet</p>
<p>Speaking of Coolbet, the company recently teamed up with Enteractive to boost player retention in Latin America.</p>
