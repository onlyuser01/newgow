    <h1>The Lodge Casino Blackhawk Hotels With Casinos Harrah S Casino Atlantic City Casino In Tulsa Ok Hote</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I previously had an account with playamo that has been closed since April 2020, i dont have access to it at all anymore.( i do have the email communication with the Playamo's Vip Manager named Elly confirming the closure of my previous account)</p>
<p>3 days ago i created a new account with them, contacted live support as well about a 'double your deposit offer they have' and was told that i could not have that because it showed that i had an account with them previously. So the 2 account situation (duplicate account) was already flagged at my first deposit which was for $250.</p>
<p>I was allowed the acces the casino keep depositing money which built up to $2205 over the next 24hrs.</p>
<p>Yesterday i got a decent win and requested a $4000 withdrawal.</p>
<p>They then decided to disable my acc because i finally had a win, was requesting a cahout and not just pouring money into their casino. Their reason given was that i had a duplicate acc.</p>
<p>Which isnt the case cause the first one is close and inactive.</p>
<p>The way i see it is that they deliberately decided to allow me to deposit into their casino eventho they knew that i created a new account and chose to cut me off once i requested a cashout taking away my winning and asking me to request for the withdrawal of my deposits ($2205)</p>
<p>Since that happen I've had no confirmation of my deposit refund even being processed.</p>
<p>They don't want to hear about the fact that my first account has been closed upon my request by one of their own manager almost a year ago, meaning there no such thing as duplicate active account and no avantage was gained from the situation.</p>
