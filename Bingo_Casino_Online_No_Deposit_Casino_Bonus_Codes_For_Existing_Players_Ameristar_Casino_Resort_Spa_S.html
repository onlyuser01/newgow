    <h1>Bingo Casino Online No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes For Existing Players Ameristar Casino Resort Spa S</h1>

<p>"Players cannot withdraw their funds unless they have verified their email addresses." - I verified my e-mail address.</p>
<p>The casino personnel will not communicate with me. I have never corresponded to a person there ever. How can I start a KYC process when the casino personnel won't send me information on what I am supposed to submit to them ?</p>
<p>If the casino won't apply my bonus then why am I required to make any sort of rollover ?</p>
<p>There is no way for a U.S. player to play video poker on this website under any circumstances even though it advertises that this game is permitted for all players (maybe not all software providers' video poker, but at least one or it is false advertising).</p>
<p>The casino violated the terms by not applying the requested bonus (advertising a bonus and then not honoring it is fraud) and not allowing video poker by U.S. players.</p>
<p>I do not have telegram,facebook or twitter and this is not listed as a requirement in the terms and conditions for withdrawing or establishing an account. I contacted their support by e-mail and attempted to engage in live chat. Both are not answered. These are perfectly reasonable attempts on my part at contact. I even tried casino.guru to try and get a resolution but nothing works. Do any personnel at casino.guru have telegram,facebook,or twitter accounts ? If so, has contact with coin365bet been attempted using these methods ?</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm sure not answering any incoming requests from myself or casino.guru for 14 days and the fact that their last facebook post is from November 22nd 2019 and their last twitter post is from August 26th 2019 (their facebook and twitter accounts are public and do not require facebook/twitter accounts to read) is all perfectly normal and is no indication of a zombie casino. This place gets a fresh reputation rating from casino.guru so I'm sure there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
