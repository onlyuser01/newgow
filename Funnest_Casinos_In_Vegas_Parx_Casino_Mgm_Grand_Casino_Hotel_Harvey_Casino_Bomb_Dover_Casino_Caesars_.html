<p>Caesars Sportsbook is now the “Official Sports Betting Partner” of the Cleveland Cavaliers following a multi-year partnership agreement between Caesars Entertainment and the NBA franchise from Ohio.</p>
<p>Official Sports Betting and Casino Partner</p>
<p>The arrangement between the US casino giant and the Cavaliers also made Caesars Entertainment the “Official Casino Partner” of the professional basketball team while its home venue, Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, is set to open a best-in-class retail sportsbook, located on the street level inside the Northwest Atrium area, pending regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>“We’re ready to welcome Ohio sports fans into the Caesars Sportsbook Empire, while also making history with our second sportsbook at an NBA arena.” Chris Holdren, Co-President, Caesars Digital</p>
<p>Caesars broke ground in May last year when its sportsbook at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C. became the first-ever at a professional sports venue. The agreement with the Cavs will see the second sportsbook open at an arena of a team from the NBA. Meanwhile, Caesars will be soon opening another Caesars Sportsbook through a partnership with the Arizona Diamondbacks from MBL at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p>“As we prepare to launch sports betting in Ohio later this year, this wide-ranging partnership enables us to connect with the Cavs’ passionate and highly engaged fanbase. Caesars Sportsbook at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse will be a first-class venue providing an exciting atmosphere for sports betting and more.” Chris Holdren, Co-President, Caesars Digital</p>

<p>Caesars Sportsbook, a year-round open sports betting facility located on the street level near the intersection of Huron Road and Ontario Street, will offer bettors betting windows for cash wagering while providing Caesars Rewards’ members with a combination of custom VIP and hospitality experiences and on-site activations throughout the year.</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art sportsbook will also feature a full-service bar and VIP lounge, an extensive menu, and wall-to-wall TVs and will be open on both event and non-event days to offer fans with event tickets and those without tickets access to wagering.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse is expected to open by the end of the year as its construction will begin shortly. The sportsbook opening is subject to regulatory and other approvals and the operator will announce further details and renderings at a later time.</p>
<p>The partnership with the Cavs also includes access to the team’s logos and marks, broadcast and digital content across the team’s properties, and in-game TV-visible Caesars Sportsbook signage.</p>
<p>As soon as Ohio goes live with sports betting, the Caesars Sportsbook app will become available for download and will begin to accept wagers from residents of the Buckeye State. Caesars Sportsbook already secured mobile access via its Eldorado Gaming Scioto Casino in Columbus.</p>
