<p>Supplier of betting and gaming solutions BETER announced this week a set of new measures for tournament organizers aimed at raising the level of transparency of the events.</p>
<p>Transparency of Events Is Paramount</p>
<p>BETER is aiming to raise the integrity bar for each of its popular live events with a range of different policies developed in line with the International Olympic Committee and the sports federations governing the Setka Cup and EsportsBattle, as well as with a common policy applicable to any other tournament organizer.</p>
<p>Andrii Nerkutov, BETER’s chief integrity officer, outlined that “principles of fair play” and the integrity of tournaments are what lies at the core of BETER’s business and the company is constantly looking for ways to refine its integrity policy and ensure the “safety” of its community.</p>
<p>“We see the integration of our new procedures and systems as another layer of integrity on behalf of our operator partners – ensuring they can have absolute confidence in the transparency of all live events provided by BETER. In-house IT solutions and the chatbot ensure the safety of tournament participants and allow for confidential reporting of any suspicious activity.” Andrii Nekrutov, Chief Integrity Officer, BETER</p>
<p>Areas for Improvement</p>
<p>Developed by Nekrutov, who joined BETER in 2021 and has been instrumental in raising the company’s industry credentials, the new measures address four areas where the integrity of tournaments and events can be improved: detection of suspicious behavior, awareness-building campaigns, intelligence-led investigation, and compliance with local sports integrity laws.</p>
<p>BETER will be utilizing an integrity operation center as an outlet for consistent exchange of information on unfair play issues with its partners, while an in-house team operating round the clock will leverage the company’s technology to provide a holistic analysis of suspicious events in-play as a fraud detection service.</p>
<p>In terms of raising awareness campaigns, BETER will utilize various methods, including e-learning, training, setting up a whistleblowing platform, implementing pre-employment checks on personnel and tournament participants, as well as an Ethics Committee to promote the standards and provide collaboration with sports federations.</p>
<p>BETER will trigger investigations in cases where suspicious behavior has been identified, working in cooperation with law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities, while all the integrity-related intelligence will be stored within an Integrity Incident Database.</p>
<p>To ensure compliance with sports integrity laws of the country of origin of each tournament organizer, BETER will deploy constant monitoring and will conduct regular reviews of existing regulatory environments in light of international sports practices.</p>
