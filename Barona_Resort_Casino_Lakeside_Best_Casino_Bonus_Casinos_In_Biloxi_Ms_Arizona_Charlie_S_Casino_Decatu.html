<p>Hero Gaming, a gamified gambling company, has reinforced its team with the addition of a former Entain compliance specialist. The one joining the company is Alistair Facciol, who will serve as Hero Gaming’s new head of legal and compliance.</p>
<p>Facciol Has Rich Experience as a Compliance Officer</p>
<p>Facciol has years of experience as a compliance officer. After working Gonzi and Associates, Advocates as a Trainee Lawyer for a year, Facciol joined Portman International as a compliance lawyer. A year later, he went to Chetcuti Cauchi Advocates where he served as a legal associate and team leader of gaming, IP and ICT for two years. This was the first time Facciol had the chance to provide counsel to the gaming industry.</p>
<p>After a two-year tenure at Fenech &amp; Fenech Advocates, Facciol finally made his first steps toward the regulated gaming industry. At first, he joined the ComeOn Group, a leading global player in the rapidly growing iGaming market. Facciol served ComeOn as a legal counsel for a year and a half before moving to Entain where he remained for almost three years. Facciol served Entain as a compliance manager and helped the company play by the rules in the markets where it offers its products.</p>
<p>Facciol’s most recent position was that of a Senior Legal Counsel for Bragg Gaming, a global B2B gaming technology provider.</p>
<p>Facciol Is Happy to Join Hero Gaming</p>
<p>As part of Hero Gaming, Facciol will ensure that the company’s products are compliant in all markets where it operates. He will also manage Hero Gaming’s legal operations from its office in Malta and will ensure that the company plays by the rules.</p>
<p>Facciol briefly addressed his new position on LinkedIn, saying that he is happy to join Hero Gaming.</p>
<p>I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as head of legal and compliance at Hero Gaming! Alistair Facciol, head of legal and compliance, Hero Gaming</p>
<p>Facciol’s appointment comes several months after Hero Gaming acquired another industry heavyweight. In February, the gamified company reinforced its leadership team with the addition of Patrick Jonker as CEO. When Jonker joined the company, he vowed to help Hero Gaming grow into a powerhouse.</p>
<p>In January this year, Hero Gaming expanded its presence in the sports betting sector. This was thanks to a strategic deal with BETBY, the self-proclaimed ultimate sports betting solution. Back then, Hero Gaming agreed to promote BETBY’s critically-acclaimed product across numerous markets.</p>
