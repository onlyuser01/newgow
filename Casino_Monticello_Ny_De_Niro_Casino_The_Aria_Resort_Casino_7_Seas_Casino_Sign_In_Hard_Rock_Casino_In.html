    <h1>Casino Monticello Ny De Niro Casino The Aria Resort Casino 7 Seas Casino Sign In Hard Rock Casino In</h1>

<p>Dear katjaleesch,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I'm sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>You are able to exclude yourself from further gaming if you believe that you are at risk of developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>We offer you cool off options for distinct periods of 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years or unlimited.</p>
<p>Once this setting has been changed, It would not be possible to undo them for any reason until the set period has not expired."</p>
<hr />
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings BetWorld247 Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@betworld247.com (you can CC me at petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
