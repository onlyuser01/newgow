    <h1>Riverside Casino Golf Resort Empire Casino New York Seminole Casino Hotel Immokalee Choctaw Casino C</h1>

<p>Hi Valter.</p>
<p>Well, I read complaints every single day of the week, hence I can't agree with you ultimately.</p>
<p>My general experience is different when it comes to registration, verification, and even for breaching the multiple accounts rule.</p>
<p>The casinos don't want to delay players from playing or depositing so they even allow people to play even if the deposit is still "in progress" because every transaction takes a couple of hours, or a few days in case of bank transfer, another delay would be the full KYC right from the beginning - not very popular for the casinos, since they normally verify only players that had actually won and submitted the withdrawal.</p>
<p>The registration is set to be as quick as possible too, because the player may lose interest to play in the casino if the initial registration seems to be "complicated". Some casinos award players for email and phone verification to make sure that players will go through it. On the other hand, some casinos only ask for phone verification only in case of withdrawal.</p>
<p>The verification can be quite different in casinos licensed by MGA and in casinos licensed elsewhere, this is another factor to be considered, the next one should be the country of residence of the player, which can affect the verification too.</p>
<p>Would be nice if all players must go through the verification first yes, but even now, when this is not a standard, lots of players still prefer crypto casinos and anonymous casinos to avoid verification at all.</p>
<p>I'll leave the rest for next time. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Stay well.</p>
