    <h1>Prairie Band Casino Resort Hollywood Casino Amphitheater St Louis Casino In Flagstaff Az Lake Of The</h1>

<p>The San Francisco 49ers got their seventh win of the season last Sunday when they defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in overtime. As a result, the Niners are now 7-6 and their playoff future looks bright. Still, to get to the postseason, they need to keep on winning. That said, a win over the Atlanta Falcons in Week 15 is a must.</p>
<p>The Falcons are 6-7 on the season, which means that they too have a chance to get to the playoffs. Their task, however, is much more difficult – they’d need to win a few more games in addition to Sunday’s game.</p>

<p>A Win is Imperative for the Niners</p>
<p>The Niners are 7-6 ahead of Week 16, but getting their seventh win was not an easy job. The game with the Bengals started well for the Niners – they got a 20-6 lead at the beginning. However, things then took a wrong turn and the Bengals entered a drive which resulted in a 20-20 stalemate at the end of the regulation.</p>
<p>The Niners then pulled themselves together in the overtime, preventing the Bengals from scoring a touchdown and winning the game. Instead, the Bengals scored only a field goal, which meant that the Niners had a chance to seal the deal with a touchdown.</p>
<p>They didn’t let this opportunity go to waste – quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo threw a pass to wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk who then score the decisive touchdown.</p>
<p>It was tense, but it was worth it. The Niners now look destined to get to the playoffs, unless something goes wrong horribly. It can go horribly if they fail to win on Sunday.</p>
<p>Can Falcons Ruin Their Opponents’ Plans?</p>
<p>The Falcons are coming back to Atlanta after a trip to Carolina last weekend. Their trip was a successful one – they beat the Carolina Panthers 29-20, thus recording their sixth win of the season. What this means is that in theory, they still can get to the postseason.</p>
<p>For that to happen, however, they would need to defeat the Niners, as well as win at least one more game before the end of the regular season. The good news for the Falcons is that they play the Detroit Lions in Week 16, which is their last game of the year.</p>
<p>After New Year’s Eve, they will get to face the Buffalo Bills on the road and the New Orleans Saints at home. It’s very likely that in neither of those games they’re going to be the favorite.</p>
<p>The reason is that the Falcons just don’t have a roster that deserves to play in the playoffs. Their best player this season has been Cordarrelle Patterson, a utility player, who’s just set the record for being the first Atlanta player to record five rushing and receiving TDs over the course of a single season.</p>
<p>It’s a great achievement for the 30-year-old, but he probably isn’t going to do much else this year. It’s just that most of his teammates haven’t been anywhere his level.</p>
<p>Picks: San Francisco 49ers to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
