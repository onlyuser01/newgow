<p>Lucky Lady’s Charms Deluxe review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Lucky Lady’s Charms Deluxe is an elaboration of the non-deluxe game that largely involves a touching up of the visual elements.</p>
<p>The grab bag of lucky items remains present in the selection of symbols – seven spotted ladybirds, rabbit foot pendants, four leafed clovers. There is even a lucky penny with the number ten on it.</p>
<p>It is not a theme of any great depth, but it gives the player something to look at while they spin the reels.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>With its fuchsia backdrop of a vaguely bucolic landscape, Lucky Lady’s Charms Deluxe’s general tone is playfully vintage.</p>
<p>The symbols have the slightly off putting digital spray paint look that a lot of Novomatic’s slots struggle with.</p>
<p>This, coupled with the borrowed spin and win sounds (this slot does not have a musical soundtrack), which are recycled from other slots in Novomatic’s stable, make the slot feel like dozens of others that are out there.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Lucky Lady’s Charms Deluxe is played on five reels with three rows and between one and ten win lines, depending on what the player chooses.</p>
<p>There is a simple free spin bonus (details below) which adds some variety to the play style.</p>
<p>On the whole, this is a very standard slot. No great advantage to it, but solid and comfortable, like an old shoe.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Two or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reel will result in a payout starting from twice your bet per spin for two symbols and running up to five hundred times your bet per spin for five.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols will also trigger a Free Spin bonus with fifteen free spins. The charms of this lucky lady make for a times three multiplier on all wins during these free spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.13%. This is almost a full percentage point under our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.01 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is at the bottom end of the "high" bracket, which makes it a pretty good match for our preferred slot machine strategies, though we would normally prefer a higher RTP.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Tired and tiring to look at, this slot's charms feel worn out on the first playthrough. The gameplay does nothing to elevate the game, and even the sound effects are borrowed.</p>
<p>Coupled with the low RTP, even the high volatility can’t win this game a recommendation from us.</p>
<p>However, it is working for some players, as this slot remains highly popular with a huge number of patrons. You might just have to give it a try for yourself and see if it’s for you.</p>
