<p>Where and When Is 100 Thieves Valorant Tournament Taking Place?</p>
<p>Date : Tuesday, April 16</p>
<p>: Tuesday, April 16 Time : 12 p.m. CT</p>
<p>: 12 p.m. CT Live stream: 100 Thieves Twitch</p>
<p>What‚Äôs Valorant and How Does It Do?</p>
<p>Even though Riot Games has kept the game fairly private, Valorant has clocked 34 million hours watched on Twitch, an Amazon-owned streaming platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the game even managed to draw as many as 1.7 million concurrent viewers, an impressive number for a beta. Yet, the moderate access to the game ‚Äì since Valorant is in closed beta ‚Äì has possibly drove the viewership up.</p>
<p>Valorant is described as an amalgamation of Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), and then some. The game is tipped to be a full-blown esports experience, as collaborated by executive producer Anna Donlon and game director Joe Ziegler who said Valorant will grow on its own pace in a recent ESPN Esports interview.</p>
<p>T1 Showcases Valorant Team in Tournament on April 16</p>
<p>Shortly after the 100 Thieves announcement, South Korean esports team T1 announced a tournament for Thursday, April 16.</p>
<p>The event will broadcast on the T1 Twitch channel and feature the talents of newly-acquired Keven ‚ÄúAZK‚Äù Larivi√®re and Braxton ‚ÄúBrax‚Äù Pierce for the organization‚Äôs Valorant esports outfit.</p>
<p>The team is coming together.</p>
<p>T1 is proud to welcome @AZKcs_ to the team as a professional player for Valorant! #T1WIN pic.twitter.com/BvqC0fpm31 ‚Äî T1 (@T1) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>Both players come from the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive competitive scene, pointing to the similarities in gameplay and necessary skills to be successful. Combining the skill-based animated system of Overwatch and the sandbox gameplay of CS:GO, Valorant is poised to make a big entry into the esports community.</p>
<p>Both tournaments will happen only two weeks after the closed beta was released. In the meantime, you can still try to obtain a key for the game by registering on Play Valorant and then link your Twitch account with your Valorant account, and then watch the official stream of the game for an opportunity to receive a key.</p>
