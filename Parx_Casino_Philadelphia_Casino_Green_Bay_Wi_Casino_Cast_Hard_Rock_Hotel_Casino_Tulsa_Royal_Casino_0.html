<p>The leading global company generating high-value leads for betting and online casino operators, Catena Media, announced a new senior-level appointment. The company confirmed Tuesday it hired the seasoned expert with a track record in the media and entertainment sector, Pierre Cadena.</p>
<p>Joining the company’s C-suite, he was appointed to the role of VP corporate strategy. Catena confirmed that in his new role, Cadena will oversee the development of its corporate strategy. Moreover, he will play an important role in the execution of this strategy across the organization, pushing for strategic positive changes.</p>
<p>Currently, Cadena holds an MBA from Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is a seasoned expert with more than two decades of experience. Cadena brings extensive knowledge and understanding after spearheading consumer technology growth within different media companies.</p>
<p>Michael Daly, Catena’s CEO, said that it is thrilling to see an expert with the rank of Cadena join the company. “His extensive expertise in strategic planning and executing growth for digital media and gaming companies will be a valuable asset for us and enable Pierre to play a core leadership role in our continued evolution in North America and beyond,” explained the CEO.</p>
