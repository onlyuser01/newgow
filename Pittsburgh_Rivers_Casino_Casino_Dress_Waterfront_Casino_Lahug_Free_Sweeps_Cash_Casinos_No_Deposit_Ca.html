    <h1>Pittsburgh Rivers Casino Casino Dress Waterfront Casino Lahug Free Sweeps Cash Casinos No Deposit Ca</h1>

<p>VIP member at OmniSlots. Have withdrawal many times before via international bank transfer. So, on 22nd Oct had a nice win, put through $5k (max daily) withdrawal via bank transfer.</p>
<p>It was taking longer than usual, so I contacted my VIP manager who convinced me to wait longer and longer assuring me when there was more info he would contact me and that if there was a problem then they would resubmit the transfer. He never contacted me, but payments department emailed me advising that the transfer had been rejected by the payment provider and the $5k was back in my gaming account. They suggested I use Ezeewallet for deposits and withdrawals. I then played some the $5k down to $3800 and tried to withdraw again via bank transfer.</p>
<p>It was instantly rejected and from then on I could not choose the option of bank transfer as a method of withdrawal.</p>
<p>I have many emails from this point onwards that are very relevant before moving forward with my complaint.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support. ðŸ˜”</p>
