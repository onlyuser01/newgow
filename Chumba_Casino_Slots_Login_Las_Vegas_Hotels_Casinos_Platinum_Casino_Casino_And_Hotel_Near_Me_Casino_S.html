<p>Football fans in the US have much to cheer on this weekend as the Super Bowl LV will decide the league champion for the 2020 NFL season, but for one fan in particular the game between Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be particularly loaded with emotions after he had placed a staggering $3.46 million bet with DraftKings.</p>
<p>Wager Based on Talent and Statistics</p>
<p>Jim ‘Mattress Mack’ McIngvale, owner of a furniture retail business from Houston, flew to Colorado and placed the sizable wager on the Buccaneers at +3.5 via his mobile phone while being at Colorado Springs Airport, to mark one of the largest single bets in the history of Super Bowl, DraftKings outlined.</p>
<p>Explaining the logic behind his decision to support the NFL franchise from Florida, McIngvale pointed to the amount of talent Tampa Bay is boasting on both sides of the ball, as well as their leader Tom Brady, the greatest football player of all times, who led them to overcome tough opposition this postseason.</p>
<p>Statistics is also supporting the team from Florida, McIngvale continued, noting the sequence of no back-to-back champions for the last 16 years, on top of the fact that back-to-back titles were seen only on 8 instances throughout the Super Bowl history.</p>
<p>Fantastic Customer Experience</p>
<p>Commenting on DraftKings, the businessman from Texas highlighted the fantastic customer experience the Boston-based daily fantasy sports (DFS) and sportsbook provided for him, the legal aspect of wagering and the safe betting environment under which his multi-million wager was accepted.</p>
<p>Johnny Avello, director of Race and Bookmaking Operations at DraftKings returned the compliments to Mc Ingvale, pointing out his previous history with the sportsbook.</p>
<p>“Mack has been a great customer and is someone we have history with after taking his sizeable wager on the Astros to win the World Series a couple seasons ago.” Johnny Avello, Director, Race and Bookmaking Operations, DraftKings</p>
<p>Avello then went on to explain the rationale behind the bet, outlining the customer’s “pure belief” that the NFL franchise from Florida “can either win or at least cover the spread”.</p>
<p>Summarizing the betting action so far on this weekend’s Super Bowl LV, the director at DraftKings said that bettors either lay -3 the Chiefs or take the Buccaneers at +3.5, looking for the best possible line.</p>
<p>According to research published by the American Gaming Association (AGA), 23.2 million adult Americans are going to place bets on the game between the Chiefs and the Bucs, to a total estimated amount of $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>After the addition of Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Montana, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington DC, the total number of jurisdictions legally accepting wagers went to 21, allowing 36 million more adult Americans to join the action.</p>
