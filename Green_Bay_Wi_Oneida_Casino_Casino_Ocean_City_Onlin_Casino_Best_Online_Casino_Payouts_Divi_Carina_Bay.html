    <h1>Green Bay Wi Oneida Casino Casino Ocean City Onlin Casino Best Online Casino Payouts Divi Carina Bay</h1>

<p>My account was in good standings, making $10,000.00 in deposits and a couple small withdrawals over 3 months time. There is no reason you have to link me to another account and take my $8000,000 in winnings.</p>
<p>LINKING MY ACCOUNT TO MY EXBOYFRIENDS ACCOUNT IS not justified, but he said there was no fraud associated with his account with bitstarz to begin with.</p>
<p>My exboyfriend was straight forward and honest about him self-excluding himself 1 year ago, he wanted to play 2 months later, opening up a second account, not knowing it was not allowed, He HIMSELF, contacted vip customer support about a bonus and telling them he got their email from his first Bitstarz account, before they asked or knew about him having a second account. He had no idea it was not allowed and was honest and told them about it. He was then told that was not allowed to have 2 account and they closed both accounts and he never returned again. This is the the account they linked me to. There was no fraud at all from this account they linked my account.</p>
<p>They did accept $30,000.00 to $50,000.00 in his money he deposited, never winning, before they closed his accounts. BITSTARZ made a huge profit off of this account they are linking my account to, before closing it, not because of fraud but because of information he provided to them, because he did not know your rules about multiple accounts.</p>
<p>I did not open my account with Bitstarz until I moved to VANCOUVER, BC, AFTER I broke up with my boyfriend. Bitstarz has linked my to an account with my exboyfriend's 2 closed accounts that were closed in good standings and because I used to date and spend time with this person they linked my account to, both in his home in the US and Canada,</p>
<p>I am requesting that I have the opportunity to provide a reasonalbe explaination and proof, to refute any evidence that BITSTARS FEELS THEY CAN USE AGAINST ME TO LINK MY ACCOUNT TO HIS CLOSED ACCOUNTS, FROM ANY INFORMATION THAT GOOGLE DOCUMENTS HAS PROVIDED.</p>
