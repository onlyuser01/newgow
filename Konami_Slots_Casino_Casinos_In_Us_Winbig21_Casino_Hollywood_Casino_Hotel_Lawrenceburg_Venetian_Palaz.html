<p>Fortune favors the brave, and in recent times – people who have been using the Jackpocket app to make purchases for popular lottery games</p>
<p>The latest lucky soul to walk away with seven figures to his name is a New Jersey resident by the name of Joseph W. who was happy to pose for the photo-op and celebrate the $1,000,000 win he flipped on $10 Powerball tickets.</p>
<p>Jackpocket New Jersey Customer Wins It Big</p>
<p>The New Jersian used the Jackpocket app to place a quick purchase and scoop up a winning ticket in the process with Joseph still not fully cognizant of what has happened. “It hasn’t really set in yet,” he told Jackpocket who used the opportunity to remind that people who use their services end up winning.</p>
<p>The winnings will be divvied up fairly by the family, as Joseph wants to share the pot with his kids and grandkids – a nice little financial cushion to bring along even more holiday mirth.</p>
<p>The winning ticket was placed on Quick Pick, which was drawn on December 13 with the winning numbers 3, 8, 41, 56, and 64. Although his ticket was a close Powerball near-miss, Joseph doesn’t seem to regret the way things turned out.</p>
<p>Joseph first started gambling on Jackpocket back in 2020 when the company was only starting to make waves in the market, hoping to expand and consolidate its presence at a time when shutdowns made it harder to buy physical tickets. Joseph’s jackpot story is certainly the right step in this direction. Yet, this is not the biggest and only prize won during the same drawing from a Jackpocket user.</p>
<p>Another lucky saw also got a hit with their Quick Pick ticket on the same draw, winning $2 million in Texas. They had also used the Jackpocket app to purchase the winner, but the company did not provide further details about this winner, supposedly at their request.</p>
<p>In October this year, another person won $2 million in New Jersey, but their name has also not been shared with the public. The same month, a person from New York ended up also winning $2 million, making for a strange succession of winners.</p>
<p>Making Jackpots Easier to Take a Shot At</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jackpocket Founder and CEO Pete Sullivan was very happy with the new winner and the opportunity to publicize the innovative approach Jackpocket has provided for people to purchase tickets and participate in lottery draws, highlighting the level of convenience but also the luck that is often befalling Jackpocket customers.</p>
<p>“Jackpocket was founded on the idea that the lottery should be accessible and convenient, and we are thrilled when we get to celebrate a major win like this one,” Sullivan said. Jackpocket has turned dozens of people into millionaires by now, with many people winning between $1 and $3 million over the past several months.</p>
