<p>PointsBet Becomes Official Sports Gaming Partner of the Indiana Pacers</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a partnership was announced between the Indiana Pacers and the premier sportsbook operator PointsBet. Under the multi-year partnership, PointsBet becomes an official sports gaming partner of the Indiana Pacers. PointsBet will be displaying branding on the out-of-bounds space between the baseline and the team bench also known as the “apron.”</p>
<p>This is in fact the first time a sports betting operator is allowed to occupy that space. In addition, under the agreement PointsBet branding will be displayed throughout the Fieldhouse as well as on phone charging stations. Furthermore, PointsBet branding will be seen on the team’s online platforms.</p>
<p>NEWS: @PointsBetIN has announced a multi-year partnership with the @Pacers to become an official sports gaming partner of the team.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, PointsBet announced a deal to become an Authorized Sports Betting Operator of the NBA.https://t.co/Mo3W4nvW9j — PointsBet Sportsbook (@PointsBetUSA) August 5, 2020</p>
<p>In order to celebrate the new partnership, PointsBet has announced special sign-up offers applicable for Indiana clients. The company assured that going forward it will continue to offer new incentives, special offers and more. Here we cannot miss to mention that earlier this year PointsBet signed a key multi-year partnership deal with the NBA.</p>
<p>New Off-Track Betting Locations Revealed by PointsBet</p>
<p>Besides the new partnership, PointsBet also revealed the planned locations of three new off-track betting venues. The operator said that there will be new betting venues in Greater Chicago, Illinois. The new venues will be located at:</p>
<p>Crestwood</p>
<p>Prospect Heights</p>
<p>Oakbrook Terrace</p>
<p>Looking back at the end of last month, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker did not extend the order allowing online registration for online betting. As a result, from July 27, gamblers that want to open an online account are obliged to visit one of the state’s land-based venues. The Chicago metropolitan area is a home for some 9.4 million people. With that in mind, the most recent move by PointsBet can only prove to be beneficial.</p>
<p>“A Real Win for Both Companies,” Said Rick Fuson, Pacers Sports &amp; Entertainment President</p>
<p>Commenting on the new deal, Rick Fuson, Pacers Sports &amp; Entertainment President said that the partnership with PointsBet: “represents a real win for both companies.” Fuson continued by saying: “We look forward to welcoming them in as a very visible brand at the Fieldhouse and through our various channels.“</p>
<p>PointsBet USA CEO, Johnny Aitken also shared his excitement by saying that the company is thrilled to unveil the fastest sports betting application in Indiana. He added that the application is powered by the “best-in-market proprietary technology” and it offers features which aren’t available on any other platform.</p>
<p>Aitken continued by saying that PointsBet will take a localized approach in order to ensure the best customer experience for the sports fans and bettors in Indiana. In conclusion, PointsBet CEO said that the company is excited to bolster its presence in Indiana and deemed the partnership as “unique”.</p>
