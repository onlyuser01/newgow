    <h1>Casinos Tunica Ocean Social Casino Casino Reinvestment Development Authority Free Casino Online Slot</h1>

<p>I'm offering a payout on the grounds that the bonus lock action doesn't say anything about the winning options as described above. This chance to win:</p>
<p>In this case, the player used the SLWEL300 bonus (100% of the first deposit – 50 EUR deposit = 50 EUR bonus), which means that according to the T&amp;C the maximum amount that can be converted is 8 times the bonus granted ( 50x8 = 400 EUR ).</p>
<p>Cannot be seen in the action presentation:</p>
<p>And if you then click on the terms and conditions marked in blue, here comes this English explanation:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, someone who has absolutely 0 knowledge of English cannot deal with these terms and conditions and was and that is the worst thing you cannot copy them to translate them with google. So then man sldo is lured with super great offers in German is really looking forward to it quickly clicks on the terms and conditions to find out and can not speak a word of English and comes to the page that is the most important page for every casino or company and this is not legible for all non-English speaking customers but also not translatable and you were made so excited about the offer that you do it anyway because you actually trusted the site, yes good test results and then you as a customer are pulled down so extremely because you deducts the €3200 he has won in one fell swoop. slotimo's statement says:</p>
<p>Stevstevii made a deposit of EUR 50 on October 11, 2022 at 23:38:45. He then activated a welcome bonus of €50 at 23:55:21 (same date – 10/11).</p>
<p>Ok I gave that meanwhile with the conversion bonus naximal. But why leave him at 2:53 a.m. with a credit of €600 that has already been won too much</p>
<p>Continue playing until about 3:25 a.m. and then from now on right in the middle of the game when you press where you already have over 4000€ and you are now only looking forward to the result of the upcoming pictures and are concentrated and the use of I believe it were €5.80 in one fell swoop</p>
<p>3200€ can be deducted</p>
<p>And don't stop the player with a conspicuous sign or the sutomatic to inform that the conversion is now taking place in the middle of the game. Because with a naximal profit of 400€, very little if you press 5.80€ and also said I pressed speed during this time, so I only noticed that the 3200€ were gone when I still had about 218€. Of course, I then immediately interrupted and went into the live chat where the first agendad wrote to me</p>
<p>"I am very sorry for you sir but unfortunately you have been taken"</p>
<p>On multiple requests like that, there was no message and so the only answers came like they weren't informed separately and stuff like that</p>
<p>In my opinion, the terms and conditions that explain the maximslgeewinne are veiled for all non-English speaking customers, especially since the English terms and conditions cannot be translated via Google. And furthermore, it's not the first time that the same thing happened here because I read about someone who had exactly the same problem and €3000 was deducted from him without warning, so it was known that something like this can happen and would have had the ability to customize this trap with a warning before converting. Precisely because something similar has happened before and was similarly discussed here on casino guro and the casino has done nothing to prevent something like this in the future and has not translated its terms and conditions or made the test in such a way that you can copy it and can translate it into an app it gives me the feeling that these incidents were reported here at least twice who knows how often this happens and the players don't report it here for these reasons I have the feeling that this is a scam to do it in a targeted manner to tempt them to continue playing in order to win the €4000 again because in fact I only played about 20 minutes in the game up to €4000 and had big wins again and again.</p>
<p>Somehow something is going terribly wrong in the casino because it is no coincidence that there have already been 2 such reports about a deduction of over €3000 and one because of a smaller amount and that opened in the early days of a new company in 2021. That's quite a lot of reports because how I already said many of the players are only annoyed after such a late unfair answer and information and don't spend the time to report here because I had to wait forever before I found the opportunity here</p>
<p>Overall, I see the situation as if a company does not provide sufficient information about its terms and conditions, which is the case here (only English terms and conditions) and then also does not consider past cases to make it better to prevent something like this, acted either intentionally, negligent or he doesn't care.</p>
<p>is that fair ?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
