    <h1>Margaritaville Casino Hotel Bossier Casinos Near Denver Ballys Casino Online Foxwoods Casino Hotel C</h1>

<p>This is not the first time the casino project has been delayed</p>
<p>The Catawba Nation is currently working on a new casino property in Kings Mountain, North Carolina. The property, called Catawba Two Kings Casino, was set to begin construction in 2022. However, various setbacks have pushed that date back.</p>
<p>Around 35 miles west of Charlotte, the tribal nation’s latest property is set to overlook Interstate 85. The casino will sport some 3,000 slots, as many as 120 gaming tables and a 400-room hotel, allowing it to welcome hundreds of guests.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the construction will experience some setbacks because of a dispute between the nation and the developer. This has caused concerns among local businesses which rely on the casino project to channel customers toward the region.</p>
<p>Restaurant and shop owners believe that the locale is too remote and say that it rarely attracts tourists. Businesses hope that the Catawba Two Kings Casino will change that trend, bringing in many new customers.</p>
<p>Because of that, the delay of the construction is a serious cause for concern among business owners.</p>
<p>The Temporary Casino Is Already Generating Traffic</p>
<p>The construction of the Catawba Two Kings Casino was supposed to begin in 2022. As mentioned, the project kept on getting delayed, to local businesses’ dismay.</p>
<p>Luckily, a temporary casino is already running and proving to have a beneficial effect on the local economy. While three times smaller than its permanent counterpart, the temporary casino boasts some 1,000 slots and multiple electronic table games.</p>
<p>Statistics show that the temporary venue has already increased the visitation rates by 25-30%. A further boost of 30% is expected once the casino plans have been completed.</p>
<p>In any case, the dispute between the Catawba Nation and the casino developer will further slow down the project. Originally expected to be completed by 2024-2025, the casino project is now in limbo, its future uncertain.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the Catawba Two Kings Casino should be complete by 2026-2027 or later. In the meantime, the Catawaba Nation is working on solutions to get the project going.</p>
<p>In the meantime, North Carolina prepares for the launch of mobile sports betting sometime in 2024. As the state braces for the launch of the vertical, lawmakers have also proposed an expansion of the state’s casino industry. However, this measure has yet to gain traction.</p>
