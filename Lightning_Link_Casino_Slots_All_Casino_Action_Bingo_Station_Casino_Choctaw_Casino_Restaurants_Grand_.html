<p>In March 2004, Niko Tosa and his companions shocked the Ritz Club Casino in London's West End by making millions of pounds at the roulette table</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Tosa had a talent for roulette that had been astounding the staff at the Ritz for two weeks prior to his big win. His technique involved waiting until six or seven seconds after the croupier launched the ball and then quickly placing bets on up to 15 numbers at once, covering a significant portion of the table.</p>
<p>Unbeatable Ritz Casino Conquered by Roulette Genius Niko Tosa</p>
<p>Niko Tosa and his crew did not win on every spin, but they won often enough to amass a stack of chips worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Despite the odds being stacked against them, the group seemed to have a knack for predicting the winning numbers. Security staff watched nervously as their chip stack grew ever higher, and Tosa and his Serbian companion walked away with six-figure payouts.</p>
<p>It was a shocking moment for the Ritz, as the casino had always been considered unbeatable due to its state-of-the-art equipment. The game of roulette is designed to be random. However, gamblers like Tosa have come up with plenty of elaborate mathematical systems to beat the game.</p>
<p>Tosa’s success at the roulette table led to suspicion from Ritz’s security chief Jon Wootten. He assumed that Tosa and his companions had used a computer to predict the outcome of the roulette wheel. Wootten had previously given a speech about the threat of tiny computing devices to casinos and had made it his business to learn more about it.</p>
<p>Wootten’s suspicions led him to call the police, who arrested Tosa and his companions. Despite their arrest, the gamblers denied using any kind of computer to predict the outcome of the game. Only Marjanovic claimed to be a professional gambler who could win 70% of the time.</p>
<p>Tosa Still Maintains He Did Not Use Any Computer Device</p>
<p>Bloomberg journalist Jack Hitt traveled to Croatia in November 2022 to meet the elusive gambling master, Nikola “Tosa” Tesanovic, who was believed to be the world’s most successful roulette player. After tracking Tosa through various addresses given to casinos over the years, Hitt managed to find a former neighbor who gave him Tosa’s phone number.</p>
<p>Despite Tosa’s initial reluctance to talk to the press, he agreed to meet Hitt for dinner in Dubrovnik. During their conversation, Tosa denied using a roulette computer, likening the idea to something out of a James Bond film, and said that he learned to beat the game through practice. He showed a video of a roulette wheel he kept in his house to train his brain and revealed that his Croatian friend, Ratomir Jovanovic, had taught him.</p>
