<p>Wheel of Fortune Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around the classic game show Wheel of Fortune.</p>
<p>Players will become the contestants in a glitzy game, hoping to claim an array of tempting prizes. Boats, cars, and diamond rings all sit alluringly on the reels waiting to be claimed.</p>
<p>This game has a nostalgic vibe and ample vintage game show aesthetics. Players will have fun entering the glamorous world of chance.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack brings to mind a crowded game show studio with chattering crowds, chimes, and the flicking of a wheel. This provides a perfect ambiance for those looking to get lost in the world of the show.</p>
<p>The backdrop is dark blue and splattered with star-like lights. This creates the effect of a night sky and makes the bright reels stand out. The backdrop is also streaked with neon arches that feel fresh out of a ‘90s game show set.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are a golden grid filled with letters and prizes. The prizes are animated in gold too, highlighting their coveted status.</p>
<p>Some might be disappointed that the eponymous wheel isn’t more central to this game’s aesthetic, though it does appear. It would have been interesting if the wheel itself had been repurposed to become the reels.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the graphics and soundtrack of this game provide a great vintage game show mood.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wheel of Fortune Megaways uses the Megaways system. This means the game randomises the number of symbols in each reel every spin.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for adjacent matching symbols going from left to right.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter and Expansion symbols. The Wild symbol will only land on reels 2 to 5.</p>
<p>There’s a chance with every Wild that it may transform into a Wild Megastack, meaning that it will expand to become 7 Wilds. Players may get up to 3 Wild Megastacks per spin while in the base game.</p>
<p>The Expanding Reels feature occurs when the Expansion Symbol lands and is replaced by a pair of new symbols, increasing the number of symbols in the reel. Each reel may extend up to 10 symbols.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is retriggered when the reels reach the maximum 10 symbols. Players then spin the Retrigger wheel to unveil the number of free spins they receive. This may be up to 12.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.46%, nicely above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it an excellent match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility game show-themed slot.</p>
<p>With excellent stats, this game is a good choice for players looking to maximise their chances for bigger wins. The nostalgic theme is also executed with engaging style.</p>
<p>The bonus opportunities are woven in with the game show theme well and this adds an extra bit of on theme flavour.</p>
