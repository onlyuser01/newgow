<p>Hi</p>
<p>I won a big amount about 7 days ago but now i am battling to withdraw my winnings.</p>
<p>I uploaded my documents last week and my identity was confirmed i waited the 5 days for my winnings and then i saw that they were canceled. I ask them why and this is what they said in email.</p>
<p>We hope this email finds you well.</p>
<p>Please note that your payout request has been declined due to the fact that we are missing your handheld picture ID.</p>
<p>Please feel free to upload a picture of you holding your ID on the website, under the Verification page or by email at your earliest convenience and then you may resubmit your withdrawal request in the system.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding in the matter. If you need any help please do not hesitate to contact us, we will gladly assist you.</p>
<p>I then proceeded to email that to them but then i was told i need to upload it on there website but there is option to upload only to initiate verification which i have tried several times but still not getting verified i even used the iDenfy app and the app tells me verified but the website tells me to initiate verification. How can it be so difficult when i have emailed all documets required as well as MY ID that i am holding as requested</p>
