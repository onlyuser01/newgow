<p>Gaming solutions provider Yggdrasil announced today it entered into a deal with Finland’s state-owned gaming operator Veikkaus, signing a Game IP Licensing Agreement.</p>
<p>Slot Games for Veikkaus’ VLTs</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal which relates to the retail segment of Veikkaus, Yggdrasil will work in collaboration with the state-owned gaming company to repurpose its slot portfolio and provide slot games for the retail estate of the operator, which operates under Veikkaus’ proprietary video lottery terminals (VLTs), extending the game content Yggdrasil already supplies for its online channel.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to extend provision of gaming content to Veikkaus in their retail environment. Expansion of partnership into Retail fits perfectly into our own and Veikkaus omnichannel strategy, w[h]ere we effectively can scale business operations, drive improved total player value, and content familiarization.” Bjorn Krantz, Chief of Global Market Operations, Yggdrasil</p>
<p>After the game content supplier provided an early proof of concept, it is expected to supply Veikkas’ retail estate with the first games fully compliant with the requirements of the gaming regulator in Finnland by mid-2021.</p>
<p>“It has been a thorough selection process by Veikkaus, and I am very proud of the Teams involved driving the successful process. We really look forward to a long and mutually beneficial retail relationship with Veikkaus.” Bjorn Krantz, Chief of Global Market Operations, Yggdrasil</p>
<p>Yggdrasil the First Veikkaus Partner</p>
<p>According to Jan Hagelberg, VP Casino Games at Veikkaus, the state-run operator is well known for delivering player protection and a full portfolio of games, including casino, sports betting and lottery.</p>
<p>On top of that, Veikkaus is a company featuring a fully integrated gaming platform and product suite with integrated omni-channel technology solution, ready to expand its VLT distribution which was so far utilized in-house to host a network of trusted online partners and third party studios and gain access to their gaming content.</p>
<p>“We’ve chosen Yggdrasil to be our first partner to pilot this because of their innovative content, proven technical capability and capacity to deliver swift time-to-market with Veikkaus team. We are excited to expand our strong partnership from online to cover also retail.” Jan Hagelberg, VP Casino Games, Veikkaus</p>
<p>The innovative gaming content provider launched some new titles to tune in for the Christmas festive period. In November, Yggdrasil presented Carol of the Elves, Christmas Tree and, after an agreement with AvatarUX, BountyPop.</p>
<p>In December, Yggdrasil entered the newly-regulated Swiss gaming market partnering with Grand Casino Luzern and its online gaming brand mycasino.ch.</p>
