<p>Packer Feels Heat Over Netanyahu Corruption Scandal</p>

<p>James Packer was sucked deeper into the corruption scandal enveloping Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu this week.</p>
<p>The Crown Resorts casino mogul must have been hoping that 2017 would be a damn sight better than his 2016.</p>
<p>Not only did he split up with fiancée Mariah Carey, apparently due to her diva-ish demands and desire to turn their life together into a reality TV show, but 18 of his employees were arrested in China on illegal gambling charges.</p>

<p>This last incident may have influenced his decision to sell up his stock in Macau and abandon his international expansion plans altogether.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately for Packer, the first week of 2017 is proving to be a bit of a clunker as well, and all because he tried to do some nice things for Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Packer’s generosity towards the Israeli PM has apparently got him on something called an Australian Federal Police “bribery watch” list this week, according to The Australian newspaper.</p>
<p>Mossad and Mariah</p>
<p>It appears that Packer has been cozying up to Netanyahu, allegedly treating him to goodies like free flights on his private jet, while showering his wife, Sara, with Mariah Carey tickets.</p>
<p>He reportedly even gave some to the head guy at Mossad, Yossi Cohen. It is also alleged that he gave gifts to Netanyahu’s son, Yair, and paid for his stay in a New York hotel.</p>
<p>It’s embarrassing for Packer, who has denied any improprieties in his dealings with the Netanyahu family, but Aussie police stress there are no allegations of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>However, they said this week they are “investigating,” as they are required to do whenever payments or gifts are made by Australian businesses to foreign heads of state and their families.</p>
<p>In Australia, bribing a foreign official is a crime that can land you up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to A$1.7 million ($1.2 million).</p>
<p>Netanyahu Questioned by Police</p>
<p>But it’s Netanyahu who is taking most of the flak for this back in Israel, where he has been accused of accepting a few too many gifts from wealthy, influential business types, and as a head of state, that’s a serious accusation.</p>
<p>According to reports, Israeli police questioned Netanyahu for five hours at his Jerusalem home on Thursday as part of a corruption investigation, the second such interview in a week.</p>
<p>As well as Packer’s freebies, he has allegedly accepted boxes of expensive cigars, worth tens of thousands of dollars, from the Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.</p>
<p>“It is clear that there is nothing of substance in the suspicions,” said Netanyahu’s attorney Jacob Weinroth said in a statement. “Any reasonable person understands that if a close friend brings his friend cigars as a gift there is not and cannot be any shred of prohibition, any trace of criminal offence.”</p>
<p>In other words, does the fact that these people are rich and powerful mean they can’t just be nice to each other occasionally?</p>
