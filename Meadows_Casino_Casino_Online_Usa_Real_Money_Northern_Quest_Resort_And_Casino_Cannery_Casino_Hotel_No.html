    <h1>Meadows Casino Casino Online Usa Real Money Northern Quest Resort And Casino Cannery Casino Hotel No</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, in this casino, you cannot see the game history, I have tried and you cannot, secondly I have asked many times that my account be closed and they do not close it, they say that I have to wait a month without entering the casino to to be able to close it, I do not understand why in other casinos you ask for it, the account closure and they close it at the moment and you can not exclude yourself, there is no tab to do it and if you speak to the support it tells you that you cannot. And the history thing, you go to Game history and the period appears, today, but you try to change it to yesterday and it does nothing. I do not know if it is why I play from the mobile, but what is not logical that I in other casinos can, and not in this one. Both self-exclusion, account closure and viewing game history. The bonus was 20 euros and I had to play 30 times its value, I always play slots, because when I thought I had already overcome it, I asked Tom why he couldn't withdraw and he told me that he had played 450/600. Ok I left the chat, I went to secret of Nefertiti and played more than 75 spins worth 2 euros and I return to the chat and he tells me that he still could not withdraw, that he had played 420/600, less than before, I told him that no I had already overcome it and the one who had to follow and who had played 520/600 another change. I went back to the same slots and played 40 spins counted at 2 euros and I returned to the chat to request the withdrawal, and he told me that he had not played 559/600 and so on several times until I lost what I had planned to withdraw, thanks to the lies of this man.
