<p>The Mississippi casino shooting led to the death of Nicholaus “Nick” Craig, 36, in September 2022.</p>
<p>Craig was in a car parked across from the Scarlet Pearl Casino in D’Iberville, Miss., at the time he was shot.</p>
<p>Craig was on his way to his relatives in Mobile, Ala. to celebrate his birthday. He stopped at the casino hotel with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>The couple had eaten dinner at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino. Later in the night, Craig left the hotel for a ride, apparently after having back pain from recent surgery.</p>
<p>Car Set Ablaze</p>
<p>Remains of Craig’s rental car, a dark blue Nissan Altima, were discovered at an apartment complex in Prichard, Ala. The car had been set on fire, destroying most of it, WXXV, a Mississippi TV station, reported.</p>
<p>Craig was from Mobile and recently was living in California.</p>
<p>Several of those indicted this week were allegedly involved in the shooting and related crimes at the Mississippi casino.</p>
<p>Shootings at Bank Nightclub and Paparazzi Club, both in Mobile, also led to federal indictments.</p>
<p>The Bank Nightclub shooting on Sept. 18, 2022, took the life of Derek Shavers. He was believed to be an innocent bystander when he was allegedly shot by Reginald Dennis Alan Fluker.</p>
<p>The six indicted defendants were identified as Fluker, John Fitzgerald McCarroll, Darrius Dwayne Rowser, Karmelo Cortez Morris Derks, Jimaurice Pierce, and Lyteria Isheeia Hollis.</p>
<p>The six were indicted on Sunday in Mobile federal court. The indictments were unsealed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Alleged Mastermind</p>
<p>McCarroll was accused of being the mastermind behind the shootings, according to AL.com, a regional news site in Alabama.</p>
<p>McCarroll, Fluker, Rowser, Pierce, and Hollis were indicted on federal conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire charges. McCarroll and Fluker also face murder-for-hire charges in another incident</p>
<p>Rowser and Derks were charged with conspiracy to commit carjacking and interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle.</p>
<p>McCarroll and Hollis, who reportedly is McCarroll’s girlfriend, were also charged with obstruction and witness tampering.</p>
<p>In addition, Pierce was charged with possession of an unregistered firearm and illegal possession of a machine gun.</p>
<p>Previously, Rowser and Derks were charged in state court with first-degree murder in Craig’s death, according to Mississippi TV station WLOX.</p>
<p>McCarroll and Rowser also were charged by Mobile police for the 2022 Paparazzi Club shooting. Four victims were wounded during the Paparazzi Club shooting.</p>
<p>Derks, Pierce, and Rowser also were facing charges for a shooting at a Walmart in Mobile in December.</p>
