<p>Charity Series of Poker Introduces Two Events for November</p>
<p>CSOP is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2014. The company’s main goal is to organize charity poker tournaments as well as other events to raise money and awareness for charities and good causes.</p>

Counting the events that the non-profit organization has previously scheduled, this marks the 34th and 35th events benefitting a good cause. Besides Nevada, CSOP has so far organized events in other states, such as Florida, California and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Full Houses of Food to Take Place on November 5</p>
<p>Event #34, dubbed Full Houses of Food, will benefit Nevada’s only food bank, Three Square. Moreover, Three Square is a member of Feeding America, and it serves Las Vegas, Clark, Lincoln, Esmeralda and Nye counties. Since its launch in 2007, Three Square has provided food to hundreds of thousands of people, and it is currently one of the most effective food banks in the US.</p>
<p>This event will take place on November 5 at London Club in Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas. The event’s reception is at 1:30 PM, while the tournament starts at 3:00 PM. Reception-only tickets will cost $100, while poker and reception tickets price will be $300. Re-buys and add-ons will cost $100.</p>
<p>Besides a $5,000 prize pool, players that climb higher in the chart can get other great prizes as well. Initially, players start with 5,000 chips, while re-buys will grant them another 5,000 chips. Besides the poker tournament, a silent auction and a 50/50 cash drawing will also take place on the day.</p>
<p>Chip In for Autism Rolls Out on November 6</p>
<p>The second event that the CSOP revealed is the Chip in For Autism, and it will support Families for Effective Autism Treatment (FEAT). The non-profit organization helps individuals with autism. Thanks to early diagnosis and intensive intervention, FEAT continuously helps families and people suffering from autism. Currently, FEAT primarily operates in Southern Nevada.</p>
