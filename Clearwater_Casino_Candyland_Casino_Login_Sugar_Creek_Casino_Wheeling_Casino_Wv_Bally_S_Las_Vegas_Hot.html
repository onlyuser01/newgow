<p>FC Cincinnati vs. New York Red Bulls is a 2023 MLS Playoff matchup, the first leg of which is on the program on Sunday, October 29, at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati finished the regular season of the 2023 MLS in the No. 1 spot in the Eastern Conference, with the best record of all the teams in the league. Cincy won the 2023 Supporters’ Shield, but this team’s ambitions do not end there.</p>
<p>Pat Noonan’s men have set their eyes on the 2023 MLS Cup, but it’s a long journey ahead. The first obstacle on that road comes in the form of the New York Red Bulls, who are coming to TQL Stadium this coming Sunday.</p>

<p>FC Cincinnati Ready for the Playoffs</p>
<p>Cincy finished the regular season with a 20-9-5 record, with one of those five losses happening earlier this month. On October 4, they lost to the New York Red Bulls at home 2-1. Truth be told, Cincy’s players weren’t too motivated in that game as they had already booked their place in the playoffs.</p>
<p>This time, however, they’ll need to take things seriously. Beating the Red Bulls at home is something they haven’t ever done. Still, their home performances have been brilliant in 2023. In the regular season, their record at TQL Stadium was 13-2-2 – no other team in the MLS had such a good home record.</p>
<p>Another thing going in the favor of Pat Noonan’s team is that his players have had more time to prepare for the first round of the playoffs. The last time they played a game was on Saturday, October 21. Meanwhile, the New York Red Bulls played a game mid-week in the MLS Wild Card round.</p>
<p>Raging Red Bulls Hoping to Cash In On Their Good Form</p>
<p>The Red Bulls finished the regular season in the eighth position in the Eastern Conference, which is why they had to play a Wild Card game against the No. 9 team, Charlotte FC.</p>
<p>The game took place last Wednesday at Red Bull Arena, and the hosts won 5-2. It was the fourth time in a row that the Red Bulls won in the MLS. Before that, they defeated Nashville (1-0), Toronto FC (3-0), and FC Cincinnati (2-1).</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati vs. New York Red Bulls Prediction</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati is a much better team than its rival in the 2023 MLS Playoffs. However, the Red Bulls are in amazing form, plus, some of their players who missed the previous game are coming back. This will make the NY side a much stronger opponent than what FC Cincinnati might be expecting, but despite that, we do think the 2023 Supporters’ Shield winners will win on Sunday.</p>
<p>Picks: FC Cincinnati to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
