<p>The recently launched coalition, consisting of non-native casinos, racinos and unions, wants to ensure a fair gaming compact is signed between the Seneca Nation and New York State</p>
<p>The gaming compact between New York State and the Seneca Nation of Indians, a leading employer that offers jobs for thousands of state residents, is set to expire on December 9, 2023. As time is running out and there are approximately two months until the expiry of the contract, intensive talks continue. While the Seneca Nation wants to ink a fair compact and protect its future, other industry stakeholders are also observing the process.</p>
<p>As announced by Spectrum News 1, a coalition formed by non-native racinos and casinos, along with unions, will also want to participate in the discussions regarding the new gaming compact with the Seneca Nation. Reportedly, representatives of del Lago Resort and Casino, Hamburg Gaming, Batavia Downs and Finger Lakes Gaming and Racetrack participate in the Fair Compact for All Coalition. Unions, including the Horsemen’s Benevolent Protective Association and Rochester Workers United, representing the employees of those gaming locations have also vowed to support this coalition.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the launched coalition is to ensure that a fair gaming compact is signed, one that doesn’t impact negatively the commercial racing and gaming sector. While the coalition would want to have its voice heard within the compact negotiations, signing the gaming compact is a lengthy process. A gambling compact would require the approval of the New York State, as well as a green light from a referendum vote from Seneca Nation citizens. The state’s legislators would need to also pass a bill that authorizes the new gaming compact while the US Department of the Interior must also grant approval.</p>
<p>Non-transparent Deals Would Not Be Tolerated by the Coalition</p>
<p>The coalition confirmed that it employs approximately 3,500 residents of New York. Moreover, it said that the gambling operators it represents pay some $180 million in gaming taxes annually.</p>
<p>Chris Riegle, Finger Lakes Gaming’s president and general manager, spoke about the importance of transparency for the new gaming compact. “We welcome competition, but we can’t compete without a level playing field. We look forward to working with our coalition members, local elected officials and representatives in Albany to secure a truly fair compact for all,” he added.</p>
<p>“We cannot and will not tolerate any middle-of-the-night deals that lack transparency, public input and data-driven economic analysis.“ Chris Riegle, president and general manager at Finger Lakes Gaming</p>
<p>The recently launched coalition comes on the heels of a tentative agreement that was reached between the Seneca Nation and the state back in June. At the time, the representatives of the coalition raised their concerns after information emerged suggesting that the Seneca Nation may consider expanding its operations. However, the aforementioned deal never saw the light of day after strong pushback from lawmakers in Rochester.</p>
