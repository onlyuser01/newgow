    <h1>Lopesan Costa Bavaro Resort Spa Casino Casino Games Slot Machines Casino Empire Horseshoe Casino Ham</h1>

<p>Good morning. I am Felipe Mellizo Villanueva, a Spanish citizen. First of all, I apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you, but I have exhausted all possible ways to solve the problem I am writing to you about:</p>
<p>Since more than two months now, I have had a complaint open against the online casino "Tsars". This casino, based in Cura√ßao, owned by "RR Investments NV" and licensed by "Antillephone N.V.", does not have a valid license to operate in my country, Spain.</p>
<p>Even so, they allow you to select "Spain" as your country of residence, validate telephones with the prefix "+34" for Spain, as well as Spanish identity documents and proof of residence.</p>
<p>In addition, "Antillephone N.V.", the body that grants the gaming licence to "Tsars" determines the following in its licence:</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the licensee to know the local laws and requirements of the territories in which it intends to offer its services.</p>
<p>This body also includes a list of countries in which online casinos with this licence are not allowed to operate:</p>
<p>Excluded Territories</p>
<p>Under this licence, apart from its own diligence and legalities, the licence holder is not authorised to offer its services in the territories of USA, Netherlands, France, United Kingdom, Australia, Spain, Dutch West Indies, Aruba, Bonaire, Saba, Statia, Dutch St Martin and Curacao.</p>
<p>I claim that in point 10.4 of the "Tsars Terms and Conditions", which determines the list of countries that are prohibited from opening an account in "Tsars" does not include "Spain" when, according to the gaming license of "Tsars", granted by "Antillephone NV", it should be included in that list. This demonstrates a "deliberate misrepresentation" in the "Tsars" "Terms and Conditions".</p>
<p>On the other hand, law 13/2011 on the regulation of gambling of Spain in its title II, article 9 point 4 determines: "The enabling titles granted by other States will not be valid in Spain. Operators recognized by other Member States of the European Economic Area must comply with the requirements and with the processing established by current legislation.</p>
<p>On 12 October 2023, i receive an email fro "Tsars" stated the following:</p>
<p>Please note that Tsars.com is an online casino that operates under a license issued in Curacao. As an officially licensed entity we have the right to freely conduct business over the internet and provide our services to end users who are located throughout the world, not solely to residents of Curacao. There are no local Curacao or internationally applicable regulations that restrict or prohibit to accept players from Spain, if they wish to open an account on our website.</p>
<p>This is totally and utterly FALSE, as "Antillephone NV" states the following:</p>
<p>Excluded Territories</p>
<p>Under this licence, apart from its own diligence and legalities, the licence holder is not authorised to offer its services in the territories of USA, Netherlands, France, United Kingdom, Australia, Spain, Dutch West Indies, Aruba, Bonaire, Saba, Statia, Dutch St Martin and Curacao.</p>
<p>They state that "There are no local Curacao or internationally applicable regulations that restrict or prohibit to accept players from Spain" which is totally false.</p>
<p>In an email received on 2 November 2023 from support@tsars.com, customer support states the following:</p>
<p>-As an online casino, our website and services are accessible to players visiting from various countries, including Spain, and if they choose to do so, they have the right to take part and use the said services.</p>
<p>-As per the information provided in the screenshots, our customer service is confirming that Spanish citizens are not restricted from using our services, (as Spanish citizens are not legally prohibited from gambling outside the borders of Spain).</p>
<p>As you will see, what is stated in this e-mail is extremely serious and goes totally against what the body that grants the gambling licence to "Tsars", "Antillephone NV", determines in this respect.</p>
<p>Thats why i ask for all my deposits back. It has now been 32 days without a reply from "Tsars" and I need your help to resolve this matter.</p>
<p>If you need more info about this issue, please, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and attention</p>
