<p>The new deal designates Kindred's brand as the soccer team's new official training wear partner</p>
<p>The professional soccer club based in Leeds, England, Leeds United, unveiled details regarding a new collaboration. The team confirmed on Monday that it joined forces with Kindred Group’s leading brand, Unibet. Under the terms of the new agreement, the brand was designated as the club’s new official training wear partner. The collaboration, Leeds United confirmed, will be valid from the start of the 2023/24 season.</p>
<p>Previously, the famous soccer team collaborated with another Kindred brand, 32Red. The two joined forces for the 2019/20 season. This happened at the time when Leeds United competed in the EFL Championship.</p>
<p>Now, under the terms of the latest deal, the Unibet brand will appear on the men’s first team and women’s team training wear. Additionally, the brand will benefit from exposure via the men’s first team coaching staff.</p>
<p>Paul Bell, Leeds United’s executive director, was excited about the new collaboration and said that the club is delighted to see Unibet become its training wear partner. “We have previously enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the Kindred Group through its 32Red brand which was on the front of our shirt when we were promoted as Championship Champions at the end of the 2019/20 Season,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to welcome Unibet as our new official training wear partner.“ Paul Bell, executive director at Leeds United</p>
<p>Sam Mead, Kindred Group’s head of UK marketing, pointed out that the company is excited to see Unibet join forces with Leeds United for the new endeavor. “Our industry-leading model of sponsorship provides benefits to both clubs and their communities – something we will drive forward throughout the season,” said Mead in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be linking up with Leeds United once again through this new partnership.“ Sam Mead, head of UK marketing at Kindred Group</p>
<p>Recently, Unibet secured a prestigious certification in Ontario, Canada. Late last month, the brand revealed that it secured Service Organization Controls 2 Type 2 compliance status for the market in the most populated province in Canada. This was a recognition of its dedication to ensuring the highest standards related to data safety.</p>
