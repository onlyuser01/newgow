<p>Casino operators in Macau are joining the fight against COVID-19 by organizing vaccinations for their employees. SJM has announced that it plans to launch a massive vaccination program, while Sands China already started vaccinating its employees and their families.</p>
<p>SJM to Launch a Massive Vaccination Program</p>
<p>To fight against COVID-19, Health Officials in Macau have asked operators to vaccinate their employees and employees’ families. The initiative was joined by SJM that announced the launch of a new vaccination program. Daisy Ho, chairman at SJM recently spoke to Asgam and revealed that under the new program, the company will encourage its team members to get vaccinated. The main goal for vaccinating employees against COVID-19 is not only personal protection but also “building an immune barrier in Macau as soon as possible,” added SJM’s chairman.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ho assured that SJM and its teams will continue to support the government in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure the health and safety of the community. The program will set up a vaccination center on June 21 and June 22 at Grand Lisboa’s Grand Ballroom. Each of the company’s team members, as well as their friends and family, can be vaccinated on site. Furthermore, vaccinated SJM members may receive up to three days of paid leave.</p>
<p>Sands China Contributes in Vaccination against COVID-19</p>
<p>Besides SJM, another major operator in Macau has also joined the fight against COVID-19. Sands China has revealed that approximately 2,300 team members and their families have registered for a COVID-19 vaccination as of June 1. The operator launched a massive vaccination site at the Venetian Macau’s Cotai Expo on May 31. The site will be active through June 3 and company members, as well as their friends and family, can be vaccinated on site.</p>
<p>Similarly to SJM’s chairman, Dr. Wilfred Wong, president at Sands China said that the vaccination against COVID-19 “is the key to helping Macau achieve herd immunity as quickly as possible“. Furthermore, he thanked the Health Bureau for their support during the vaccination. By vaccinating against COVID-19, China Sands employees and their families are not only protecting themselves but are also contributing toward the building of an immune barrier, said Dr. Wong in conclusion.</p>
