    <h1>Lake Of The Torches Resort Casino Casinos Near Colorado Springs Green Valley Ranch Resort And Spa Ca</h1>

<p>Hi Kristina! Sorry it took so long to get back to you. There is absolutely ZERO CHANCE that there was another account created. Unfortunately, I don’t know of a way to access the chats that I had with them, so I can’t really send you the communications.</p>
<p>So here are some of my thoughts on this situation, Kristina:</p>
<p>If I was not allowed to play because I had "broken rules", why did they let me sign up in the first place? Also, if there was already an account for me, why wouldn’t it just tell me to log instead of letting me register as a new player?</p>
<p>Also, the Casino had no issues with me "breaking rules" when I was losing and they were taking my money. No word from anyone about anything, and that was what was happening the first few times I played with them. Then I finally won and very quickly I was a "rule breaker" and my account was immediately closed.</p>
<p>Also, the first customer service rep I spoke with (I will try to figure out a way to get you the communications) assured me that ALL money in my account, including winnings, would be paid to me "within 24-48 hrs". Then I got an Email from the Validation department saying it was closed and I would only get deposits back. That Rep was positive that my winnings would also be cashed out with my deposits because my account was closed and that was how they did it. If others did have closed accounts and did get their winnings back, why not me? Did I win to much? Was this person not telling me the truth?</p>
<p>I really wanted to talk to someone to get it worked out and try to figure out what they were talking about. They said I would not be able to speak to anyone about my issue. Per the rep, a number to call for customer service does not exist for their slots. The Chats with the representatives got me nowhere and I was blocked from escalating my problem with them.</p>
<p>Just as a side note, on Trustpilot (where I wrote a review), there is a review from someone else who had THE EXACT SAME THING happen to him with this casino, but his was for $1,300. He talked about how no one would explain anything and was asking for help from others to get his winnings. I have found other reviews out there from others who have complained about the same thing with this casino as well…</p>
<p>I saw something where the Casino has a rule that you can only win up to $1,000/day? I hit that $2,000 basically on one bonus stage. Maybe that was really the rule that I broke? Maybe that’s why I could not have my winnings?</p>
<p>I know we do not know each other Kristina, but I am an honest guy. I swear on everything I own that there were never multiple accounts set up. My Wife does not gamble, so I am the only other person in the household (at least for the last 13 years). I had never had any fraud issues with my identity, and I KNOW I did not already have an account with them. I have had the same Email address (which I would have signed up with) for about the last 20 years. True I have moved before, changed my number, and have sometimes gone as "Joe" and other times as "Joseph", but these things should not effect anything. Changes like these do not translate to different accounts.</p>
<p>Again, if I "already had an account" and/or I was "playing illegally", why didn’t they let me sign up? Why did they not say a word about it until right after I won money? Seems like a very strange coincidence.</p>
<p>Sorry to chat your ear off, but I know in my heart I got scammed. I AM POSITIVE I did. I truly believe if I had not won, and kept losing, my account would still be open today.</p>
<p>I TRULY appreciate you looking into this for me. If I can find info on the correspondence between the casino and I, I will send it to you ASAP.</p>
<p>Thanks again for listening, Kristen.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Joe A***</p>
