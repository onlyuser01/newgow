<p>Dear Tracey,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please understand that KYC account verification is a very important and essential process, during which casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take few working days completing this thorough procedure. It's common that they request some documents repeatedly.</p>
<p>Afterwards, it’s quite usual for a withdrawal, to take a couple of days or even weeks to get fully processed. This means that it may take some time before your money appears in your account.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this information was helpful. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Nick</p>
