<p>Can Mathematics improve the economic status of a person?</p>
<p>Although it is true that the world economy is going through a great crisis, it is no less true that technological advances are opening the floodgates to new opportunities not only to publicize new discoveries, but also to make available to the human being, tools that will help you improve your income significantly.</p>
<p>Such is the case of someone who has just formulated an interesting theory, in which he states that combinations or what we know as combinations do not exist.</p>
<p>Nor chance and probabilities.</p>
<p>The numbers are in constant orbit and they do not combine, they are conjugated in pairs, to form variables that give rise to the creation of scenarios.</p>
<p>If any scenario is addressed and we want to know, according to its author, what will be formed, it is only enough to detect the corresponding orbits to issue a forecast with a level of success that goes from 90% to 95%, leaving 10% or the remaining 5% in which the forecast fails, to an orbit change.</p>
<p>According to his theory, all scenarios known to man are made up of numbers and these numbers are in constant orbit.</p>
<p>He asserts with conviction that the universe is too perfect for there to be an approximation in the resultant of some scenario.</p>
<p>But the incredible thing about this is that it roundly proves its theory with a roulette or Ferris wheel, in which it demonstrates.</p>
<p>To do this, he recorded a video that we can access for free, where he uses what he called: The Third Vector, and exposes an explanation, which gives a lot to think about.</p>
<p>This is the link, to watch the video and it would be good if they made comments, not in a disqualifying way, but rather stating their objections in a logical and reasoned way.</p>
