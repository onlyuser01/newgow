<p>Responsible gambling will play an increasingly important role in Brazil and Latin America as one of the biggest markets in the region, Brazil, is hammering out the final details of its regulatory framework. In light of this SBC and the Brazilian Institute of Responsible Gaming have teamed up ahead of the inaugural SBC Summit Rio which will shed light on many of the regionâ€™s big questions.</p>
<p>This alliance will allow the two partners to collaborate on a range of important initiatives before, during, and after the event itself which is due to take place at the 5-star Windsor Barra Hotel in Rio, Brazil on March 5-7, 2024.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Institute of Responsible Gaming is an industry-led initiative reuniting some of the biggest names and operators forming the organization earlier this year in March. Amongst the founding companies are Entain, Betsson Group, Flutter Entertainment, Betway Group, Bet365, Yolo Group, NetBet Group, Rei do Pitaco, and KTO Group.</p>
<p>The Institute is now tasked with ensuring that Brazilian players can access products that are built in the context of a safe and responsible gaming environment. Commenting on the opportunity to work closer with SBC, Brazilian Institute of Responsible Gaming PresidentAndre Gelfi said:</p>
<p>"It is an honor for IBJR to be partnering with SBC for the inaugural SBC Summit Rio. As this will be the first event in a regulated Brazil, it is important for us to partner with a company that helps bring the industry together to discuss all the pressing issues in the country and supports our values with their educational content and efforts."</p>
<p>He hailed the upcoming SBC Summit Rio as an excellent opportunity to ensure that stakeholders explore the opportunities that Brazil presents in gaming and do so responsibly. More importantly, the Institute will be able to use the event and spread its message with some of the biggest names in the industry.</p>
<p>Naturally, SBC will also benefit as its event is going to gain further exposure and establish itself as one of the leading industry gatherings for years to come as well. The partnership with the fast-developing Institute will certainly help it to resonate better with local industry players.</p>
<p>This opportunity was similarly welcomed by SBC Americas VP of MarketingCristian Robalino who said that the Institute was indeed a defender of fair and effective policies and regulations. Leveraging this experience is important for helping industry stakeholders understand the market further and driving value for everyone involved in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>SBC Summit Rio will be able to bring together 150 expert speakers along with 70 exhibiting brands across the event.</p>
