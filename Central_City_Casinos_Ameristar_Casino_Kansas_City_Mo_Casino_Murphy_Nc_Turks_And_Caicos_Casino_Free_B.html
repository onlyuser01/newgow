<p>Jackpocket continues to expand rapidly across the United States with the company launching its dedicated app in yet another state</p>
<p>The new rollout targets the state of Nebraska where players will have a chance to use the dedicated lottery app and participate in a number of popular lottery draws across the country.</p>
<p>Jackpocket Joins the Cornhusker State to Bring More Lottery Joy</p>
<p>Those include Mega Millions, Lucky for Life, Pick 3 and Pick 5, and not least, the Powerball, which is habitually dishing out massive and life-changing prizes.</p>
<p>The lottery app allows you to order a ticket quickly and easily as a player without the need to actually visit a retail location. Jackpocket will store it for you and transmit it through the appropriate channels in case of a big win exceeding the app threshold. This saves time and allows customers to move forward with orders as they see fit.</p>
<p>Jackpocket enables customers to order their tickets from handheld devices. Players can withdraw up to $500 directly from their apps, but for bigger prizes – including the Powerball jackpot, for example, the company works with third parties to make sure that recipients get their prize pools.</p>
<p>Jackpocket essentially ensures that the ticket – which is stored by the company – is transferred to the winner in physical form. Winners of massive jackpots need to go to the state lottery and present their winning tickets.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Jackpocket CEO and founder Peter Sullivan said that he was excited to bring the company’s innovative platform to yet another state. “We’re committed to making the lottery safe, convenient and fun,” Sullivan added.</p>
<p>Jackpocket Gathers Momentum in the US with 16 States and Counting</p>
<p>The executive noted that Jackpocket so far has seen 29 players become millionaires – with those individuals winning more than $1 million – and said that the Cornhusker State would soon have its own. Jackpocket has been expanding rapidly across the United States.</p>
<p>The lottery is present in 16 states, including Nebraska, and Jackpocket has shown no signs of intent to slow down any time soon. Meanwhile, the company has been involved in a variety of initiatives. Jackpocket was part of the Gift Responsibly Campaign for the fifth year in a row in 2022 and it even became the official lottery partner for the Dallas Stars.</p>
<p>On balance, Jackpocket has been strengthening its position across the United States at a time when lottery products are becoming increasingly popular owing to how accessible they have become over the past years.</p>
