    <h1>The Q Casino Planet 7 Casino No Deposit Slot Machine Casino Chanced Casino Online Casino Betting Ygg</h1>

<p>Yggdrasil has strengthened its foothold in Latin America by inking a new partnership with Campeón Gaming</p>
<p>Leading iGaming publisher committed to delivering state-of-the-art online gambling solutions and innovative content to players, partners, and clients, Yggdrasil, has reached a new milestone in its growth plan.</p>
<p>The provider has inked a fresh and “strong” partnership with Campeón Gaming, the 2017-founded “esteemed iGaming operator” that offers customized content that fits customers in worldwide markets and an immersive in-house platform.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil, Expanding Its Reach in LatAm</p>
<p>The new partnership with Campeón Gaming will assist Yggdrasil with its LatAm expansion plans.</p>
<p>Originally, the publisher that welcomes everyone to a “world of entertainment” debuted in the region in May 2022 after it made a selection of games available to Colombian operators.</p>
<p>This highlighted its clear intention to grow in the regulatory markets in LatAm, following a more complex strategy to grow its international business.</p>
<p>As a result of the newly announced collaboration, Campeón Gaming’s brands will benefit from Yggdrasil’s iconic game portfolio as well as its YG Masters content.</p>
<p>The list will feature games that incorporate the provider’s Game Engagement Mechanics, with freshly launched titles Legend of Dragon Wins DoubleMax and high-performing games throughout the year including 10 000 BC DoubleMax and Starfire Fortunes TopHit.</p>
<p>The YG Masters portfolio of slots includes releases from some of the most popular software providers and studios in the iGaming world.</p>
<p>All games are highly innovative and they employ Game Adaptation Tool &amp; Interface, which is Yggdrasil’s top-tier technology that allows its partners to generate “cutting-edge content followed by rapid distribution.”</p>
<p>The Partnership Mixed the Innovative Strengths of Both Parties</p>
<p>As explained by Campeón Gaming’s group chief commercial officer, George Merodoulakis, the collaboration “combines the innovative strengths of both Campeόn Gaming and Yggdrasil.”</p>
<p>The CCO also spoke about their intention to hit the refresh button on their game portfolio with Yggdrasil’s content, thus providing “a broader range of entertainment” to their users.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s commercial director, Jose Kadala, also took the opportunity to comment on the new agreement.</p>
<p>He spoke about the warm welcome that their proprietary content and YG Masters studios have received from both players and operators in LatAm while expressing excitement to further extend their reach in the market via Campeón Gaming, which he called “an established and prominent operator with expertise in the field.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Yggdrasil announced the launch of ReelPlay’s King Arthur 10K WAYS slot.</p>
