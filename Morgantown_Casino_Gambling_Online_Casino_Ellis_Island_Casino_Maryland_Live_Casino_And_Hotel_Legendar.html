    <h1>Morgantown Casino Gambling Online Casino Ellis Island Casino Maryland Live Casino And Hotel Legendar</h1>

<p>In 2022, for the first time in the last 17 years, the World Series of Poker (WSOP) changed its usual location at the Rio in Las Vegas and made a historic debut on the Vegas Strip, at Bally’s and Paris Las Vegas. The 2023 event that will mark the prestigious event’s 54th annual event will be once again held at the same two new locations on the Vegas Strip for the second year in a row. Caesars Entertainment has made all the announcements just ahead of the holiday season.</p>
<p>WSOP 2023 at Bally’s and Paris Las Vegas Between May 30 and July 18</p>
<p>The richest and longest-running poker gaming event in the world will make a comeback in 2023 after this year’s tournament recorded more than 197,600 entrants from over 100 countries worldwide. The 2022 event hit a total prize pool of close to $348 million that broke records and considerably raised the bar. The decision to use the same two new locations was, therefore, a direct result of the success of the event’s debut on the Strip, according to World Series of Poker’s senior vice president and executive director Ty Stewart. Stewart expressed Caesars’ joy and excitement to be coming back to Paris Las Vegas and Bally’s which will soon be renamed as Horseshoe Las Vegas for “another exciting chapter in the tournament’s history.”</p>
<p>2023 WSOP Will Host Classic and New Events</p>
<p>Poker aficionados can already start marking their calendars and booking their trips to Vegas for next year’s event. The full WSOP schedule has not yet been fully disclosed, but Caesars has revealed that the much-anticipated $10,000 No-Limit Hold’em World Championship best known as The Main Event will return, together with other timeless classics and fresh events including weekend events high on demand that have already been confirmed.</p>
<p>In 2022, The Main Event marked the second-largest field in live poker’s history with a prize pool that went over the $80,780,000 mark and received more than 8,660 participants. In 2023, the event will once more consist of four starting days players will get a chance to choose from, between July 3 and July 6, along with the buy-in option during either of the Day 2’s on July 7 or July 8.</p>
<p>“Mystery Millions” is the name of the flagship opening event which will be a $1,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold’em tournament that will include mystery bounties starting at from $10,000 and up to $1 million for every knockout. The same opening event will also feature a guaranteed first prize of $1 million. This year, the mystery bounty event enrolled more than 14,100 participants and brought professional poker player Matt Glantz the mouth-watering $1,000,000 bounty.</p>
<p>Paris and Horseshoe Las Vegas senior vice president and general manager Jason Gregorec said that the anticipation is already building at the two resorts with more than half a year ahead of the event.</p>
