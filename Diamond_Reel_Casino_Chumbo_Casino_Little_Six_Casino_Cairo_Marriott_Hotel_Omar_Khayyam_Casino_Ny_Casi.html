    <h1>Diamond Reel Casino Chumbo Casino Little Six Casino Cairo Marriott Hotel Omar Khayyam Casino Ny Casi</h1>

<p>hello ..</p>
<p>deposit in the casino with second deposit bonus ..</p>
<p>about 5000 ars which with the relover I played more than 300000 ars which I more than fulfilled but for withdrawal they do not have astropay as is how I deposit and so the casino demands that it be by the same deposit &amp; withdrawal method. In any case, some casinos offer a bank transfer but for which reason it is unfeasible in my case since I am from Argentina and they ask me for a van number, which does not exist here... we only manage with the swift. The casino does not have online chat and does not answer emails.</p>
<p>I don't have a way to withdraw but I do have a way to deposit quickly and easily... so what do we do in this case? I have nothing against the casino, it is my second deposit and this time with success because I have winnings to withdraw but it does not seem right to me that they do not have online chat, they do not respond to emails, you are left adrift ... I just want to withdraw what I win and what Tell me that if tomorrow, for example, I will quote again what my legal withdrawal method will be since they charge you the deposit by astropay without problems but they ask you for an iban code if you want to receive by bank transfer and they ask you for an iban code what Which one here in Argentina is no longer used. I repeat the swift code. Yes, you cannot carry out the transaction by not completing that information, so there is no way to withdraw for me. Imagine, without the terms and conditions, that the withdrawal method must be the same as In this case, the deposit with Astropay runs the risk that they will unfairly keep my earnings.</p>
