<p>The officer convicted for robbing three major Las Vegas casinos, amassed over $160,000 in daring heists between November 2021 and February 2022</p>
<p>A former Las Vegas police officer, Caleb M. Rogers, was handed a 12-year federal prison sentence by US District Judge Andrew P. Gordon on October 17, concluding a trial that exposed a shocking tale of casino robberies.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Heist Mastermind Rogers Shakes City’s Casinos with Daring Crime Spree</p>
<p>Rogers, 35, was found guilty of robbing three prominent casinos in Las Vegas, amassing a staggering sum exceeding $160,000. The daring heists, occurring between November 2021 and February 2022, left the city’s glittering casinos rattled, reported The Associated Press.</p>
<p>During the trial, prosecutors revealed that Rogers, donned in black latex gloves, dark clothing, and a mask, executed his meticulously planned operations with ruthless precision. His modus operandi involved brazenly approaching casino cashier cages and menacingly demanding money while feigning possession of a concealed weapon. Rogers’ criminal spree included successful heists at the Red Rock Casino Resort, Aliante Casino &amp; Hotel, and the iconic Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino near the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Rogers brandished a service firearm during the Rio Casino robbery, further escalating the gravity of his crimes. His arrest on February 27, 2022, ended in a struggle with casino security officers in a parking lot, not far from the Las Vegas Strip. Despite being outnumbered, Rogers threatened to shoot the officers before being apprehended. The arrest left one security guard so shaken that he resigned, illustrating the profound impact of the incident on those involved.</p>
<p>From Respected Officer to Criminal Mastermind</p>
<p>Rogers, a once-respected member of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, had fallen victim to a severe gambling addiction and mounting financial pressures, which prosecutors argued drove him to desperate measures.</p>
<p>His younger brother, Josiah Rogers, provided damning testimony during the trial, recounting the details of the Red Rock Casino robbery, where they made away with approximately $73,810. Josiah Rogers, testifying under immunity, described the rehearsal, meticulous planning, and subsequent division of the stolen money in their shared apartment.</p>
<p>The sentencing, which took place in a federal courtroom, was attended by Rogers’ mother, Crystal Rogers, who expressed disappointment over her son’s actions. Rogers, showing remorse, apologized for his crimes and spoke of the impact on his family and loved ones.</p>
<p>Judge Gordon acknowledged Rogers’ service to the community but underscored the gravity of his offenses, emphasizing that Rogers had allowed his demons to overpower him, leading him down a path of armed robbery. Rogers’ defense attorney, Richard Pocker, stated that they planned to appeal the convictions and the sentence, particularly challenging the government’s evidence linking his client to two of the robberies.</p>
