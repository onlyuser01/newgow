<p>The new Ontario-facing agreement further expands DraftKings and High 5 Games’ existing relationship in North America</p>
<p>High 5 Games, one of the largest independent providers of casino games, has announced a new agreement with the gambling giant DraftKings. Under the new agreement, the supplier will power DraftKings’ operations in Ontario with content.</p>
<p>As a result of the partnership between High 5 Games and DraftKings, players in Ontario will get to play a vast selection of feature-rich gambling games. Online casino enthusiasts in the Canadian province can now try games such as Triple Double Da Vinci Diamonds, Platinum Goddess, and The Green Machine Supreme.</p>
<p>In addition, Ontarian players will be some of the first to experience Goldstruck Blasts, High 5 Games’ latest hit. The fresh mining-themed game was released earlier this month and is sure to appeal to many gamblers in the province.</p>
<p>The Ontario-facing agreement will expand High 5 Games’ presence in North America while deepening the supplier’s relationship with DraftKings. The two companies have an existing relationship in several US states.</p>
<p>High 5 Games Feels Privileged to Work with DraftKings</p>
<p>Anthony Singer, the chief executive officer of High 5 Games, commented on the new agreement with DraftKings. He said that his team is “incredibly pleased” to expand its presence in more regulated markets whilst expanding the company’s agreement with the operator.</p>
<p>Singer added that High 5 Games is looking forward to supplying DraftKings with more games and providing its fans with exciting new experiences.</p>
<p>As we continue on this growth trajectory, we feel privileged to offer new and exciting gaming content to the DraftKings fanbase while meeting our shared mission of servicing all iGaming states across North America as well as Canada. Anthony Singer, CEO, High 5 Games</p>
<p>High 5 Games and DraftKings continue to grow together and support each other’s success. This new joint expansion into new markets further outlines their commitment to providing best-in-class gambling content to players.</p>
<p>The partnership between DraftKings and High 5 Games is expected to grow further, with West Virginia likely being the next jurisdiction where the supplier will roll out its games. The two companies hope to reach every regulated state in the USA.</p>
<p>High 5 Games recently bolstered its presence in Pennsylvania, after successfully launching its games with Rush Street Interactive and BetMGM.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, DraftKings just unveiled a new office facility in Las Vegas, which the operator will leverage to expand its local presence. The 90,000-square-foot office is notably the company’s second-largest office in the US and features more than 130 dedicated sports trading desks.</p>
