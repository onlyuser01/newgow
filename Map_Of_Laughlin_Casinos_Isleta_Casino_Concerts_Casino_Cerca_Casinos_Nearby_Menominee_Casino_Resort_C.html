<p>Codere Online has launched its first campaign in Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital. This comes a few months after the operator forayed into the city.</p>
<p>The Next Big Move Is Yours</p>
<p>Codere Online rolled out a new marketing campaign with the motto “The next big move is yours.” The campaign prompts bettors in Buenos Aires to try out Codere’s diverse gambling offerings. By using the operator’s site, local punters can bet on sports or play slots and casino games.</p>
<p>Codere Online teamed up with the Italia agency for the creation of the new campaign. It will be broadcast on various local TV channels and the web starting this month. From then on, local people will be seeing the new ads for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>The promotional content consists of six short videos that will go live on TV and the Internet. According to the operator, they will represent ordinary everyday situations where people enjoy betting as a social activity.</p>
<p>Alberto Telias, the chief marketing officer of Codere Online, spoke about the new ad campaign. He is certain that it will reinforce the operator’s brand in the region. In particular, the new ads will help it to promote Codere Online’s content to local bettors and inspire them with supreme experiences.</p>
<p>Telias added that the Codere brand will continue improving its content with key partnerships, such as agreements with soccer teams, that appeal to customers’ passions and preferences.</p>
<p>Codere Online is a spun-off part of the Spanish operator Codere that was segregated from its land-based business. Codere focuses on the LATAM region but has been considering changing its focus since a new management team came into power.</p>
<p>Argentina’s gambling market isn’t homogeneous and instead allows major regions to decide their gambling laws by themselves. Buenos Aires launched its regulated gambling market in 2021. Soon after that, Codere Online secured a license from the Lotería de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. With the regulator’s approval, Codere Online forayed into the city.</p>
<p>Codere Online Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Codere Online is currently available to customers in Colombia, Mexico and Panama. The brand also has existing agreements with some of the most notable soccer teams in the region, including Argentina’s Club Atlético River Plate and Real Madrid CF.</p>
<p>Codere Online’s 2021 financial reports showed that the brand is consistently growing. In the second quarter of the year, the operator posted a 43% rise in revenue. Despite the regulatory headwinds, the company successfully maintained its momentum, ending the year with a 17% year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>Mexico remains one of Codere Online’s most important markets and was one of the main contributors to the brand’s favorable Q1 2022 results.</p>
