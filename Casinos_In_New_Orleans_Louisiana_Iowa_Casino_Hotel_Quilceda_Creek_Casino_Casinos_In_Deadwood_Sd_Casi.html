<p>The supplier of iGaming content has made another stride in the highly-regulated European market with two prominent brands</p>
<p>CT Interactive will provide 23 exclusive games which will be launched on the palladiumgames.be and 36win.be operators. Among the titles that will be launched are such choices as Beetle Dice, Chilli Jester, and not least, Dice Quest.</p>
<p>Players will have access to these and more titles for the first time in Belgium, which is one of the most strictly regulated markets in Europe, but also one of the most rewarding. CT Interactive director of business development Americas Martin Ivanov welcomed the opportunity to see the company’s products launched with yet another operator and its brands.</p>
<p>“For CT Interactive is a great honor to have its portfolio available at such a well-known platform that is famous with its diverse offerings,” Ivanov explained. The representative was confident that the products that are created by CT Interactive are of impeccable industry quality and create unique values for the brands that adopt them.</p>
<p>Pascual Gaming’s Joeri Pascual was similarly confident that the new additions will help with Belgian players. He argued that local players tend to be very selective and that CT Interactive is famous for its original and adventurous games which is what is going to strike home with Belgian players.</p>
<p>CT Interactive has been expanding its reach in Europe over the past several months. The company signed a partnership with NetBet in Italy and 7Bet in the Baltics. The supplier remains a popular choice among operators who are trying to bring strong titles to the market and leave a lasting impression on their players.</p>
