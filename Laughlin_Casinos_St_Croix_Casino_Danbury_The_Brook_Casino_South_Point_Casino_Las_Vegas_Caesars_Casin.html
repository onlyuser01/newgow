    <h1>Laughlin Casinos St Croix Casino Danbury The Brook Casino South Point Casino Las Vegas Caesars Casin</h1>

<p>I once had over 300€, but now I am down to 137.27€. I am trying to retrieve this sum.</p>
<p>The issue stems from my use of a Paysafe Voucher to make a deposit, as I typically do in other casinos. I do not have a Paysafe account. I am aware of some casinos where one cannot make a deposit without a Paysafe account, and I don't play at those because I don't have such an account. However, I am frequently demanded to upload a screenshot with payment confirmation from my nonexistent Paysafe account since I was able to deposit at their place without one.</p>
<p>I have written to the customer support several times explaining the situation, and they seem to understand and have promised to escalate the matter.</p>
<p>I was also told that I could withdraw through mifinity because withdrawals of 20€+ are only possible there, whereas for a bank transfer the minimum is 500€+.</p>
<p>Despite having done everything asked of me and the support team assuring me that they would see to the issue, I am still receiving the same email after the third time, demanding again the deposit confirmation from my Paysafe account (which I logically cannot have). Even though I did send them photos of my voucher and a screenshot as transaction evidence demonstrating that the deposit was made without a Paysafe account.</p>
<p>It's absolutely despicable for them to provide customers with a deposit option that doesn't require an account and then refuse to process withdrawals because the deposit was made without that account.</p>
<p>I feel helpless here; my correspondence with customer support has not yielded any resolution yet.</p>
<p>I'm really starting to feel like they're toying with me.</p>
