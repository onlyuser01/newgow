    <h1>Admiral Casino Mesquite Nevada Casinos Hotel Casinos Near Me Boomtown Casino Hotel Casino Slots Game</h1>

<p>Sports Information Services has struck a partnership with UK-based operator Spreadex for its advanced esports betting solution and product, SIS Competitive Gaming. As a result, Spreadex will be able to provide live head-to-head events developed by SIS and featuring professional or highly skilled gamers.</p>
<p>SIS Goes Live with Spreadex in the UK</p>
<p>The initial coverage will focus on three titles, and the most recently launched Counter-Strike product. The format for CS:GO competitions is set at two-versus-two specifically to make it simpler for bettors to understand and follow the action. Spreadex will have access to an array of in-play and pre-game betting options and further benefit from SIS’s ultra-low latency live streaming data, on-screen widgets and graphics, and more.</p>
<p>CS:GO is by far the most endemic esports tournament featured by SIS, and it complements Competitive Gaming’s Esoccer and Ebasketball offers. The addition now means that Spreadex and any SIS partner can presently offer their player bases more than 150,000 events every year.</p>
<p>The referees who sit in on contests covered by Competitive Gaming also have referees who have received training from the Esports Integrity Commission, an NGO dedicated to tackling fraud in esports and esports betting. SIS is determined to continue building up its product in future and will seek further partnerships with sportsbooks who are keen on adopting and leveraging esports betting products.</p>
<p>SIS commercial manager for the UK and Europe Harri Hulatt welcomed the opportunity to expand with yet another partner and continue to deliver the company’s advanced esports betting solutions to new audiences:</p>
<p>It’s fantastic to announce such a high-profile deal with Spreadex for our new 24/7 CS:GO offer, and we are thrilled to provide them with the quick-fire betting opportunities and superior margins. SIS commercial manager for the UK and Europe Harri Hulatt</p>
<p>Both Companies Confident in Success of the Rollout</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by Spreadex head of trading, product &amp; operations Andrew Wallington who was pleased with the opportunity to launch SIS Competitive Gaming onto the operator’s platform.</p>
<p>He argued that the addition of this option would increase the number of quality betting opportunities that Spreadex can offer to its customers. “It is a product that we believe will greatly appeal to our customers, and the three titles, including Esoccer, Ebasketball and now CS:GO, will help increase engagement and drive incremental revenues,” Wallington concluded.</p>
