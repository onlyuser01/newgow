<p>The deal with Meridianbet is the biggest sponsorship deal ever signed by a Serbian basketball team and marks a major milestone for both KK Crvena zvezda and Meridianbet.</p>
<p>KK Crvena Zvezda Changes Name to KK Crvena zvezda Meridianbet</p>
<p>KK Crvena Zvezda, which is a men’s basketball team based in Belgrade, is considered one of Serbia’s most successful basketball teams as it currently holds 22 National League titles. The club is a founding member of the Adriatic Basketball Association (ABA) and competes in both the ABA League and the EuroLeague.</p>
<p>Under the new collaboration agreement, the team will change its name to KK Crvena zvezda Meridianbet and the sports betting operator will become its shirt sponsor and main team sponsor. Additionally, Meridianbet will also become the club’s sports betting partner and will have a large presence during all of the team’s games on their home turf, the Aleksandar Nikolić Hall.</p>
<p>On top of giving the team a considerable financial injection, Meridianbet is going to utilize all of its promotional channels to bring the team forward and engage with its growing fan base.</p>
<p>A Winning Deal for Both Parties</p>
<p>The new partnership is a perfect match for Meridianbet, one of whose core markets has always been Serbia. The company has stated: “By partnering with KK Crvena zvezda, Meridianbet is able to further cement its commitment to the sports industry and contribute to the growth and development of basketball in the region.”</p>
<p>The President of KK Crvena zvezda Nebojsa Čović was also thrilled about the new sponsorship: “With this contract, we have made a big step forward as a club that, despite having achieved so much, wants to do even better and even more.”</p>
<p>Čović further noted that the club is extremely pleased that a major sports betting company such as Meridianbet has noticed their work and has now become their partner. He also expressed his excitement about opening a new chapter of the team’s history together with Meridianbet.</p>
<p>No financial details were disclosed about the deal with Meridianbet. However, the previous title sponsor of KK Crvena zvezda, Telekom Serbia, was providing the team with EUR 1.2 million ($1.3 million) per sports season, which means that the sum coming from Meridianbet is larger.</p>
<p>Meridianbet was founded in 2001 and is currently operating in 18 countries situated in Europe, Africa, and Latin America. The company employs over 1,500 people. Its core markets lie in Serbia, Cyprus, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tanzania, and Malta with a main focus on sports betting in regulated markets.</p>
