    <h1>Talking Sticks Casino Casinos In Mesquite Nevada Nashua Casino Penn National Casino Grantville Casin</h1>

<p>Hollywoodbets continues to expand what is already a formidable selection of online casino games, with the iGaming platform growing significantly over the past several months. Now, the South African-focused gaming platform has received a new content injection from Light &amp; Wonder, an established developer of online casino games of chance.</p>
<p>The partnership is important not only for the fact that Hollywoodbets will significantly expand its iGaming platform. It also allows Light &amp; Wonder to plant its banner on the exciting South African iGaming market, which has become an important focal point of international supplier efforts.</p>
<p>The company has received all necessary licenses and cleared all relevant procedures. As a result, Light &amp; Wonder can introduce a lot of its own in-house games, but also third-party content from the likes of Greentube, Relax, Big Time Gaming, Fantasma, and many others.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets players will in turn get access to a fantastic selection of trustworthy, feature-rich, and established games that will be available in their local market. Overall, Africa is an exciting market for not just the operator, but suppliers such as Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>There have been several big movements in the sector over the past few years, including the launch of 888 Africa, a dedicated subsidiary operating under the 888 Holdings’ roof, and clearly demonstrating that global appetites for the iGaming market in Africa have been whetted.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets Head of Product Wayde Dorking said that the company was very excited to embark on this new opportunity. The highly compelling content brought around by Light &amp; Wonder is precisely what the company needs, Dorking explained, speaking highly of his company’s ambitions for the future.</p>
<p>"By integrating Light &amp; Wonder’s platform, we are looking forward to adding other third-party studios to our audience," he added.</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Light &amp; Wonder Commercial Director James Bustin who was equally pleased with the chance to see his company break new regulated ground and further enhance its presence in international markets.</p>
<p>"We are excited to have launched our online games that we know South Africans already love playing in land-based casinos, and now we look forward to launching even more content from our partner studios in the coming months," Bustin added.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets has also been strengthening its game library with other partners through direct content integration. The operator teamed up with Spinomenal and Pragmatic Play earlier this year.</p>
