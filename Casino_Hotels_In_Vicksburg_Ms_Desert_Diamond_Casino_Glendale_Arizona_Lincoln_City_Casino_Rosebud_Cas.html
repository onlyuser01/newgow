<p>BetMGM and the Detroit Tigers entered into a multi-year sponsorship agreement to make the sports betting and iGaming brand an official gaming partner of the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise.</p>
<p>Branding and Content Integration</p>
<p>The agreement between the betting brand owned by MGM Resorts and Entain and the professional baseball franchise in the gaming category includes branding on scoreboards at Comerica Park, customer-oriented marketing promotions, and social media content integration, among other initiatives.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to expand our relationship with BetMGM to feature the Detroit Tigers and Comerica Park. Our fans will enjoy the enhancements this partnership provides to their experience, both at the ballpark and in rooting on the Tigers from home.” Peter Kent, SVP, Corporate Partnerships, The Detroit Tigers</p>
<p>The home of the Tigers, Comerica Park, located within The District Detroit, will feature prominent BetMGM signage, including on the out-of-town scoreboard and the speed pitch LED board, as part of the deal, while digital and social platforms of the MLB franchise, including the MLB Ballpark App, will integrate content from BetMGM.</p>
<p>“From day one, it’s been a priority for us to develop deep relationships with Michigan’s beloved sports teams. We look forward to our partnership with the Detroit Tigers and engaging with their fan base to offer best-in-class promotions and benefits only available on BetMGM.” Matt Prevost, Chief Revenue Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>Presence on Michigan Sports Scene</p>
<p>The Detroit Tigers, which have won 4 World Series and 11 American League pennants, made history in the summer last year after an agreement with Australian-based sportsbook operator PointsBet to become the first MLB franchise to enter in a partnership with a sports betting company.</p>
<p>“The Detroit Tigers are a central part of the Michigan sports scene and bring an undeniable energy to the city. MGM Grand Detroit is ready to welcome Tigers and sports betting fans to our BetMGM Sports Lounge before, during, and after games for an innovative and exciting experience.” David Tsai, President, Midwest Group, MGM Resorts</p>
<p>The deal with the Detroit Tigers is the latest for the sports betting and iGaming brand with an MLB franchise, following an exclusive agreement reached with the Washington Nationals in January for a multi-year partnership.</p>
<p>Besides in baseball, BetMGM ensured a strong brand presence in other professional sports, entering into partnership deals with the Pittsburg Steelers from the National Football League (NFL) in November and Philadelphia 76ers from the National Basketball League (NBA) in December last year, as well as with IMG ARENA to utilize its Golf Event Centre sports betting solution earlier this month.</p>
