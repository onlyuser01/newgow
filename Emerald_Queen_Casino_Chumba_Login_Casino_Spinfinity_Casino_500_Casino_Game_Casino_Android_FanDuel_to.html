<p>On Tuesday, the FanDuel Group announced it will provide real-time highlights of PGA TOUR events to FanDuel Sportsbook app users.</p>
<p>FanDuel Sportsbook App to Provide Users with Real-Time Golf Highlights</p>
<p>Yesterday, sports-tech entertainment company FanDuel Group announced it will begin providing real-time highlights of PGA TOUR golf events to FanDuel Sportsbook app users. In August 2020, FanDuel announced a partnership with PGA TOUR to become its official betting partner.</p>
<p>As an official betting partner, FanDuel is entitled to use marks and also advertise within TOUR Media as well as TOUR partner platforms in the USA. FanDuel can also create pre and post-game betting programming, as well as provide highlights to its sportsbook users who have made a bid.</p>
<p>“We’re taking the FanDuel Sportsbook app experience beyond just placing a bet — now our customers will get the best TOUR highlights delivered to them each week to consume and act on.” Adam Kaplan, GM/VP of Sports Content, FanDuel Group.</p>
<p>Kaplan added that the company aims to provide players with a fully integrated experience by engaging in real-time with the sports they like. Norb Gambuzza, Senior Vice President, Media and Gaming at the PGA TOUR said that engaging new fans with PGA TOUR content is a key pillar in the company’s sports betting strategy and the partnership with FanDuel is a move in this direction.</p>
<p>The Sports Betting Industry Thrives to Provide Players with Unique Experience</p>
<p>The Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego will be the first event in the scope of FanDuel.</p>
<p>Punters will receive notifications for each TOUR event in 2021 through FanDuel Sportsbook app powered by WSC Sports’ AI technology. The users of FanDuel Sportsbook app will also have the opportunity to see automated highlights through rich media push notifications and will enjoy a superior customer experience by FanDuel’s use of in-game, real-time content.</p>
<p>FanDuel Group hopes to expand its coverage into other sports apart from TOUR golf content.</p>
<p>PGA TOUR features other official partners as well, such as BetMGM, DraftKings and PointsBet. DraftKings and the PGA TOUR signed in July 2020, followed by BetMGM a few days later.</p>
<p>On Monday, PGA TOUR and PointsBet Sportsbook entered a partnership with NBC Sports for the first betting companion show. Golf fans will be able to participate in the simulcast betting event called NBC Sports Edge BetCast, which will focus on the Waste Management Phoenix Open.</p>
<p>The premier presentation of the NBC Sports Edge BetCast will be launched on Peacock Premium alongside NBC Sports’ telecasts of the Waste Management Phoenix Open on GOLF Channel and NBC from Thursday, February 4 through Sunday, February 7 at TPC Scottsdale’s Stadium Course.</p>
