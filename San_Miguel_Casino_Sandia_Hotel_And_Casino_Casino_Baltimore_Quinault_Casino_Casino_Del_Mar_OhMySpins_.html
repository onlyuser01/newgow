<p>Dear Pslive,</p>
<p>I received additional details from the casino.</p>
<p>After gathering and reviewing all the necessary information and details (all the communication between you and the live chat representatives), we are closing this complaint as unjustified because the casino was able to support its claims with sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>In the communication, there are no signs of gambling addiction, and you did not mention anything that could indicate it either. You asked the casino for bonuses, and after receiving a negative reply from the live chat representative, you asked them for self-exclusion on March 6, 2023, stating literally just "Too little bonus and cashback" as a reason, while you asked them for a bonus in 3 other live chat sessions on the same day. I see you asked for it also on March 9, 2023, but you also contacted the casino because of a bonus. The last time you mentioned your self-exclusion request in the live chat was at the time you again asked the casino for a bonus (March 13), this time you claimed that you will not self-exclude yourself if the casino gives you a bonus. You have not mentioned your self-exclusion request anymore and enjoyed the given bonuses. The casino (logically) tried to keep you as a customer, provided you with the requested bonus, and met your requirements. I can see you even claimed another cashback bonus a few days after this complaint was submitted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no reason for the casino to reconsider its decision regarding your deposits. They were simply lost by playing in the casino. The casino acted in accordance with its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, OhMySpins Casino team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
