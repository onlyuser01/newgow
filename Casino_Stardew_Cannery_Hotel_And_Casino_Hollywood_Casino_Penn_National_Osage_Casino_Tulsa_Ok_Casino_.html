<p>The Tennessee Titans probably feel very good about themselves after absolutely demolishing the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7. Their next job should be even easier, although the fact is that the Indianapolis Colts are on a pretty decent run with two straight wins.</p>
<p>This explains why the Tennessee odds aren’t too short. Actually, when the odds got published, the Colts were the favorite at some online sportsbooks. Things have changed since due to bettors heavily backing the Titans.</p>
<p>Are they right to do so? Let’s see!</p>
<p>Titans vs Colts Odds (NFL Week 8, 2021)</p>

<p>AFC South Belongs to Tennessee?</p>
<p>The Titans are at the top of the AFC South with a 5-2 record. No matter what happens in Week 8, they will stay there. Still, beating their divisional rivals would mean making a giant leap toward the postseason.</p>
<p>It’s because their main competitor for the AFC South title is the team from Indiana, whose record is 3-4. The other two – Jacksonville and Houston – are currently at 1-5 and 1-6, respectively.</p>
<p>So, can the Titans beat the Colts? Sure, they can! After all, we saw them beating the mighty Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7. Sure, Kansas City has been in dreadful shape this season, especially in the defense. Their offense, led by Mahomes, however, was pretty decent.</p>
<p>At least that was the case before Week 7. However, against the Titans, Mahomes and Co. could not do much. Tennessee’s defense held them to just three points. That was the Chiefs’ worst offensive display since 2012.</p>
<p>If the Titans managed to stop the Kansas City offense, they surely can stop the Colts, right?</p>
<p>Indianapolis’ Good Run to Come to an End?</p>
<p>The Colts are coming into the Week 8 game after two straight wins. Sounds impressive, but their opponents were two struggling teams – Houston and San Francisco.</p>
<p>When facing tougher opponents, the Colts usually don’t do that well. Evidence of this is that they lost their first duel with the Titans in 2021. The score was 25-16 and something similar will probably happen this time as well.</p>
<p>In Week 8, however, the Colts will have one major advantage. The game is played on their turf, Lucas Oil Stadium. Unfortunately for them, they lost their previous two duels with the Titans at this stadium. In both of those, we saw the Titans covering the spread.</p>
<p>Will the same happen this time? It might, especially because the spread is set to just one point.</p>
<p>Pick: Tennessee Titans to win and cover the 1-point spread; we should see ‘over’ hitting as well.</p>
