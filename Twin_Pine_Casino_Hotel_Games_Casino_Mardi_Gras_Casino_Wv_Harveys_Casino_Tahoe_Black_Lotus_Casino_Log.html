<p>Asian-Focused Lucky Dragon Casino Bets Big on VIP Gamblers</p>

<p>The Lucky Dragon Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas is the first resort that’s truly focused on the Asian visitor. And four months since the venue opened its doors, the marketing strategy is reportedly paying off.</p>

<p>The Lucky Dragon recently announced modifications to its property that will create more gaming space for VIP players. The second floor’s highly popular Pearl Ocean restaurant will replace the Asian-themed food court on the first floor. The square footage on the second floor will become a VIP gaming lounge resembling those in Macau.</p>
<p>The resort is also implementing a “rolling chip” program for VIP gamblers. Similar to Macau, the loyalty rewards scheme will give high rollers a percentage of their bets back, regardless of whether they win or lose at the tables. The program requires an upfront bankroll buy-in of at least $10,000.</p>
<p>“Our current VIP business has a need for the additional area. If we had anticipated that six months prior we might have changed that from the beginning, but that’s not a bad thing to have happen,” Lucky Dragon VP of Marketing Jordan Seager told the Las Vegas Sun.</p>
<p>With just 203 hotel rooms and a gaming floor that covers less than 30,000 square feet, the Lucky Dragon is relatively small compared to the Strip’s major players. But the latest newcomer to Vegas is certainly causing quite a stir.</p>
<p>Targeting China</p>
<p>China has been cracking down on the VIP segment in Macau for the last two years. And while revenue has now stabilized in the Special Administrative Region where gambling is permitted, nearby Asian countries are trying to become the new destination for the high rollers.</p>
<p>Over 6,000 miles away, could the Lucky Dragon also be in the mix? The company says California and the Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for Asian cultures, and those residents are now coming to Vegas for its themed resort. But signs seem to suggest the casino is also going after China.</p>
<p>Hainan Airlines has begun its nonstop daily service from Beijing to McCarran International in hopes of bringing the middle class to Sin City. In addition to Asian-focused gaming with plenty of baccarat and pai gow, the Lucky Dragon offers a spa, indoor-outdoor Cha Garden equipped with a tea sommelier, five Asian-inspired restaurants, and guest service members fluent in a variety of Asian languages.</p>
<p>Resorts World Kickstarter</p>
<p>No, the Genting Group’s proposed $7 billion Resorts World property on the Strip isn’t petitioning donations online. But the financials from Lucky Dragon might be reason enough for the Malaysian-based company to finally move forward with the project.</p>
<p>Resorts World is the theorized 6,583-room resort with a 175,000-square-foot gaming floor. The Asian-themed concept has been delayed one year after another, as Genting has cited falling currency for the reason for the company’s decreased global investment power.</p>
<p>The massive construction undertaking is likely to be scaled back, but Genting executives were recently in Vegas seeking the blessing of the city’s zoning commission to move forward with the project. Genting is expected to release a new blueprint for the acreage in April.</p>
