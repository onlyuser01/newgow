    <h1>Bay Area Casinos Casino Bus To Atlantic City Best Payout Online Casino Ignition Casino Review Poker</h1>

<p>Greentube has secured a 40% stake in Flamingocatz, a gaming studio startup that will produce content for the former company.</p>
<p>Greentube, a “vibrant and extremely international” developer of games for the casino industry, has strengthened its presence in North America by securing a 40% stake in Flamingocatz, a local studio startup. As agreed, the two companies will unite their efforts to launch better and more exciting content for customers in the NA region.</p>
<p>Greentube Inks Deal with Flamingocatz to Reinforce Its NA Strategy</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Flamingocatz, a fresh game studio that was established this year, will supply Greentube with innovative and disruptive gaming titles, tailored to the needs of North American audiences. Flamingocatz’ titles boast innovative design and intricate mathematics to deliver truly entertaining experiences.</p>
<p>Greentube will thus be able to diversify its portfolio with exciting new games developed by the startup. Its new partner’s biggest strength is its knowledge of gaming in NA and the regional preferences of casino customers. While the titles are developed with the local audiences in mind, Greentube also plans to roll out the new content in various other markets as well.</p>
<p>The first Flamingocatz titles will go live in 2023. Greentube will first launch them in North America with launches in other jurisdictions planned for later dates. The agreement is a mutually-beneficial one as it will strengthen Greentube’s portfolio and NA-oriented business while promoting Flamingocatz’ titles and helping the startup make its name known.</p>
<p>The United States and Canada are important regions for Greentube’s strategy, which is why the provider has been investing actively in its North American operations.</p>
<p>Flamingocatz Is Glad to Have Greentube’s Backing</p>
<p>Job Spiero, one of Flamingocatz’ founders, spoke about his feelings about the new agreement. He said that his studio is excited to work with an established company such as Greentube. Spiero said that his team could not have hoped for a better partner for Flamingocatz in the Americas.</p>
<p>He is certain that Greentube’s expertise in content distribution, placement and advertising will help Flamingocatz’ innovative titles reach many players. Spiero finally concluded that he has big hopes for the partnership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michael Bauer, CFO and CGO at Greentube, said that his company will continue working hard to expand its presence in the NA region. The joint venture with Flamingocatz, he said, will further reinforce the provider’s ability to roll out and provide great new games to gambling operators.</p>
<p>Having a laser focus on what local players desire is paramount to us and this partnership will help us execute our growth strategy in the US and Canada. Michael Bauer, CFO, CGO, Greentube</p>
<p>A few days ago, Greentube launched with Entain’s brands in Ontario, which was a huge milestone for the company.</p>
