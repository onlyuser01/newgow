    <h1>New York New York Hotel Casino Pool Best Western Plus Boomtown Casino Hotel Casinos In Shreveport Ca</h1>

<p>Hello kkracken0228,</p>
<p>We hope that you are well.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your concerns through Casino Guru.</p>
<p>We do understand that from the user's perspective, the system should automatically block an incorrect cryptoaddress input and this is actually implemented.</p>
<p>However, we must turn your attention to the fact that a cryptoaddress that starts with the number "3" is a valid LTC cryptoaddress. When Litecoin was initially introduced it shared the network with Bitcoin and Legacy cryptoaddress format was used for both currencies. In early 2017, LTC adopted SegWit and new cryptoaddress format was introduced - addresses starting with "L" and "M". However, the old format, starting with "3", remained in use and still can be used for Litecoin transactions.</p>
<p>Given that you had multiple successful withdrawals, you are fully introduced to the withdrawal procedure and you are aware of the fact that when a player submits a withdrawal request, a Payout Confirmation Email is sent to the player to which he or she is obliged to reply in order to confirm the requested cryptoaddress for the withdrawal. Without said reply, the Payments Team does not proceed with the finalization of the withdrawal request. Below, you may see the screenshot of said confirmation email.</p>
<p>We completely understand that it is frustrating to be left out of your winnings due to such an oversight, but ultimately, it is the player's responsibility to make sure the cryptoaddress is the correct one.</p>
<p>Given your overall status at Yabby Casino, we are willing to add a free chip to your account in order for you to try your luck again and hopefully win and receive your withdrawal instantly.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you are interested in the bonus.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Yabby Casino Management</p>
