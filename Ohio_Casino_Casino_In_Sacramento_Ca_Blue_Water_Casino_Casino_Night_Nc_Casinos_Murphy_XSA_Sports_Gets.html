<p>Pragmatic Play is flexing its regional muscles once more with the company continuing to grow its presence in Brazil</p>
<p>This time, the acclaimed supplier of casino games has launched with XSA Sports, helping the company catch itself up to an iGaming golden standard in the fast-evolving jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Marches on in Brazil</p>
<p>XSA Sports will now considerably grow its footprint in online games of chance with the addition of Pragmatic Pay’s slots. The titles that the studio is bringing include many acclaimed options, such as Secret City Gold, Pinup Girls, Gates of Olympus, and more.</p>
<p>The studio is bringing a mix of traditional, player-favorite and brand-new games that will all be injected as part of the XSA Sports casino offer. This is not all. Pragmatic Play will also deploy its Live Casino options and introduce players to blackjack and roulette tables played in the company of professional croupiers.</p>
<p>Players will similarly gain access to titles such as Boom City, Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, and other titles designed as shows. Pragmatic Play is also bringing its portfolio of virtual titles, such as Horse Racing, Penalty Shootout and Darts.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play VP of Latin American Operations Victor Arias welcomed the partnership on a similarly positive note. He noted that the company was happy to team up with XSA Sports as it seeks to expand its presence in the regional market, and Brazil in particular. He said:</p>
<p>This latest signing marks another benchmark in our growth strategy in the region and the wider LatAm market, along with providing new reach for our games, bolstered by XSA Sport’s leading position. Pragmatic Play VP of Latin American Operations Victor Arias</p>
<p>XSA Sports representative said that the company was very happy to strengthen its presence in the regulated gambling market in Brazil through the addition of products from a reputable tier-one supplier such as Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>Latin America Is Ever-Important for Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that their company was committed to only offering players innovative and high-quality products across the board. “We have no doubt this will be a successful collaboration for both parties and that together we can deliver an unbeatable gaming experience to Brazilian players,” they concluded.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has not shied away from signing meaningful partnerships in the region. The company set up a content alliance with Track and Races in Venezuela in February and prior to that, the company teamed up with Jacare.bet, also in Brazil.</p>
