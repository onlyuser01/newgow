    <h1>Lake Charles Casinos Hotels Caesars Casino Michigan Grand Sierra Resort And Casino Reno Nv Mississip</h1>

<p>Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc. issued today its first quarter financial results for 2020, with revenue significantly impacted by the shutdown of operations in mid-March, despite the excellent start of the year.</p>
<p>Revenue Pre- and During Closure</p>
<p>Revenue for the first two months was up 23.4%, to $90.3 million, as opposed to $73.2 million for the respective period the year before. Including March, revenue fell 9.5% to $109.1 million, from $120.6 million posted for Q1 2019.</p>
<p>Net income during January and February was down $4.2 million, 43.9%, but adjusted EBITDA was up $2 million, 8.2%, year-over-year, while first quarter net income was down $26.5 million, a staggering 150.5% drop, from $17.6 million in 2019, to -$8.9 million now, with adjusted EBITDA down 49.7%, from $43.9 million in Q1 2019, to $22.1 million for the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>“While our full quarter results were meaningfully impacted by the closure of our properties in March, we have taken broad-based actions to reduce expenses and enhance liquidity… Despite near-term uncertainties, we are confident that our strong balance sheet, liquidity and long-term strategic planning will enable us to emerge from this crisis in an even better position.” George Papanier, President and CEO, Twin River Worldwide Holdings</p>
<p>Liquidity Position</p>
<p>By the end of March, Twin River had $361.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, having fully drawn on its $250 million revolving credit facility. In May, the casino operator increased its term loan by $275 million under the existing credit agreement and fully repaid the outstanding $250 million of its revolving credit facility, reaching a total liquidity in excess of $620 million, with no substantial debt maturities before 2024.</p>
<p>Despite operations being interrupted by the mandated closures, Twin River is fully focused on its expansion strategy, looking to close in a measured sequence over the next year the acquisitions of new casinos, Eldorado Shreveport Resort and Casino in Shreveport, Louisiana, and the MontBleu Resort Casino &amp; Spa in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, from Eldorado Resorts, and Bally’s Atlantic City Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, from Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>Contingency Planning</p>
<p>Twin River expressed its concern that the health crisis will continue to negatively impact its results, as there is a degree of uncertainty regarding when the number of visitors will restore to pre-closure levels. There are other factors that are indeterminable at this time, dependent on future development of the health crisis, as well as other challenges stemming from the global economy.</p>
<p>Despite that some states have already announced plans to re-open their non-essential businesses, Twin River is planning to reduce cash burn rate to approximately $3 million per month, in case a long-term shut down takes place. The company made provisions to withstand a period of 18 months, despite its operations costs incrementally going up with the new casino acquisitions.</p>
<p>Twin River is in the process of establishing a prudent, multi-phased approach to re-open its facilities, including entrance screening, thermal cameras, social distancing and frequent cleaning and sanitizing protocols, mask protection and public signage.</p>
