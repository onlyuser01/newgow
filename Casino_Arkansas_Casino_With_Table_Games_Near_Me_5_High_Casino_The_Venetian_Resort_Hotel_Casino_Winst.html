<p>The successful giropay transfer is documented in the current account statement. The account statement is considered a legally binding document, which can be used to prove the successful transfer to the provider without any doubt.</p>
<p>We recommend that you contact the provider again as your contractual partner and insist on the delivery of the goods/services ordered. If you cannot come to an agreement with the provider, you have the right to take legal action due to non-performance of the purchase contract.</p>
<p>We would like to apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. Best regards</p>
<p>Your giropay service team</p>
