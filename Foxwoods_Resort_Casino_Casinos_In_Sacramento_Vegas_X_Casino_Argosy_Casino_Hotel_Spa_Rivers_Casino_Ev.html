<p>A global leader in sports technology, Sportradar has entered a new partnership with Hard Rock Digital, which is an online sports wagering and iGaming joint venture between Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Digital Live Streaming Hub to Benefit from Sportradar’s Content Portfolio</p>
<p>The Hard Rock Digital sportsbook has recently added a live streaming hub, which is directly integrated into its mobile application. Its new partnership with Sportradar, which will span over a number of years, will help Hard Rock Digital offer diverse sports content from Sportradar’s live streaming portfolio.</p>
<p>The new collaboration will offer Hard Rock Digital’s customers access to over 150,000 contests, which include major leagues such as the National Hockey League (NHL), Spanish soccer’s Copa del Rey, Germany’s Bundesliga, national basketball leagues from China and Germany, Polish Table Tennis Elite Series, International Tennis Federation (ITF) and Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) events.</p>
<p>Sportradar group head for regional sales Michael Gandolfo has highlighted the significance of the partnership:</p>
<p>With the increase of mobile and growth of in-play sports betting in the US, live streaming has become more important than ever. By providing our extensive portfolio of content, Sportradar has met that challenge and will enable Hard Rock Sportsbook to enhance its product with an even more engaging and entertaining customer experience.

<p>The collaboration with Sportradar will give Hard Rock Digital a considerable advantage in the highly competitive US market as it will enable it to offer a unique product and user experience combining the in-app live stream of a considerable amount of sports content with sports betting.</p>
<p>The new partnership agreement is an extension of Sportradar’s current collaboration with Hard Rock Digital, which included live sports betting and pre-match data services, and will continue to enhance the further engagement of sports fans and the retention and acquisition of customers.</p>
<p>A Summer of New Partnerships for Sportradar</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the summer, Sportradar has been lining one partnership after the other. A big part of the new agreements will help Sportradar expand its over-the-top (OTT) product offering in addition to its sports data collection services.</p>
<p>In May, the company added one more hockey league to its 9 partnerships with a new agreement with the Australian Ice Hockey League.</p>
<p>Sportradar’s basketball offering was also expanded in July with a new multi-year partnership with the Turkish Basketball Federation. Additionally, the company also introduced a brand-new online NBA product as an extension to its longstanding partnership with the NBA.</p>
<p>Another important collaboration saw Sportradar supporting the integrity of soccer games with a key partnership with the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, under which the two organizations created a mobile application meant to fight match-fixing.</p>
<p>In August, Sportradar’s integrity services were further expanded into international golf with a milestone partnership with the International Golf Federation (IGF).</p>
