    <h1>Login To Casino French Lick Casino Bellagio Casino Las Vegas Treasure Island Resort Casino Minnesota</h1>

<p>Dear THE GURU,</p>
<p>I ask you to accept a complaint against AllSlots Casino. The casino has been processing my withdrawal for over a month.</p>
<p>On May 02, 2023, I registered an account at Allslots Casino. As a result of the game, I managed to win a little, and my balance was 1644 US dollars.</p>
<p>On May 03, 2023, as part of the verification process, I sent a photo of my ID Card and a photo of my bank statement to the casino for verification.</p>
<p>On May 4, 2023, I received a message that the documents were accepted and the account was verified. On the same day I put my funds for withdrawal.</p>
<p>After that, on May 04, I received a second request for the documents that I sent earlier. I contacted the chat for clarification, and they told me that the request was sent in error, there is no need to provide documents. I was also informed in the chat that my withdrawal was being processed and it would not take long.</p>
<p>On June 01, I sent an official claim to the casino. The casino confirmed receipt of my claim, but on May 2, 2023, I registered an account with Allslots Casino. As a result of the game, I managed to win a little, and my balance was 1644 US dollars.</p>
<p>On May 03, 2023, as part of the verification process, I sent you a photo of my ID Card and a photo of my bank statement for verification.</p>
<p>On May 4, 2023, I received a message that the documents were accepted and the account was verified. On the same day I put my funds for withdrawal.</p>

I contacted the chat for clarification, and they told me that the request was sent in error, there is no need to provide documents. I was also informed in the chat that my withdrawal was being processed and it would not take long.</p>
<p>On June 01, I sent an official claim to the casino, the casino confirmed the receipt of it</p>
<p>Also on June 09, I asked the casino for a game history to confirm that there was no violation of the casino rules on my part. However, as of June 19, the casino did not provide me with any game history or funds.</p>
<p>Please help me to get 1644 US dollars belonging to me.</p>
