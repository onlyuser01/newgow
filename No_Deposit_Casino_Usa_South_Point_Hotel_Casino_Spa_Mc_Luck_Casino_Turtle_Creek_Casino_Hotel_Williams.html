    <h1>No Deposit Casino Usa South Point Hotel Casino Spa Mc Luck Casino Turtle Creek Casino Hotel Williams</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I deposited at Viggoslots with a 100% bonus (€20) and ended up with a total of €40 balance. I started playing a game that was legal (stack em) in this game I won almost €250. I requested a withdrawal of €150 and canceled the bonus. After about 1 hour I canceled the payout and continued playing. €150 real money was shown in my account. No info on any bonus. Now, according to the terms and conditions, I played a game that was not allowed and won €4,500. In the end I had requested a payout for €1500. However, this was canceled because I allegedly violated the T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Now my question: Where exactly did I violate the terms? The rules state that real money is used first and then bonus money.</p>
<p>In my statistics you can see explicitly that I only played around €2 before I canceled the bonus again.</p>
