    <h1>Casino Coconut Creek Hotels Near Mountaineer Casino Don Laughlin S Riverside Resort Hotel Casino Roc</h1>

<p>Good morning!</p>
<p>Yesterday, 03/27/2023, I made a deposit in the amount of 50.00 reais and a message appeared that I received a bonus in the amount of 25.00 reais, and for me to receive the value of this bonus, I would have to multiply it by x30, which would give a value of 750.00 reais.</p>
<p>I accepted this bonus, started playing and made a sum of 925.56 reais, according to the attached print, and when I went to withdraw it, it showed a message that I would have to bet another 286.40 reais, no longer fulfilling the message given to the accept the 25.00 reais bonus that I mentioned at the beginning. Therefore, I bet this 286.40 reais and even so the site did not comply with the rules once again. So I decided to cancel the bonus, and what they did, they kept all the amount I won, they don't cancel the bonus, they cancel the amount that is earned and it stays for them, just like that. For me it's the most absurd thing I've ever seen, they just keep what the customer earns and I didn't follow the rules that they themselves stipulate and are followed.</p>
<p>I got in touch via chat, the analyst who answered simply said that he had a message saying that if I cancel, I would lose all the amount, and this was not displayed. Then I ask, imagine the amount of values they get from customers. This is blatantly stealing from the customer.</p>
