<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB), which is responsible for implementing, managing, and enforcing the Michigan Gaming Control &amp; Revenue Act’s provisions, has given the green light to 888’s VHL Michigan subsidiary to turn into the Hannahville tribe’s new platform provider under the Sports Illustrated brand.</p>
<p>Twin Spires Exited the Business in 2022</p>
<p>The Hannahville Indian Community’s tribe has entered the agreement with 888 Holdings as a result of its former platform provider for online gaming and sports betting, TwinSpires, announcing that it would leave the deal in 2022. Accordingly, Churchill Downs’ sports betting business is no longer involved in offering any online gaming or internet sports betting services to the people of Michigan.</p>
<p>MGCG’s executive director Henry Williams explained that the community in Hannahville was the first operator in the US to change its platform provider since the legalization of online gambling. He also acknowledged 888 Holding’s ability to use its experience to stimulate the growth of the tribe online.</p>
<p>As a result of TwinSpire’s exit from the business, 888 Holdings’ VHL Michigan LLC became the tribe’s new online sports betting provider starting September 7, 2022.</p>
<p>Discussing the new agreement, Williams expressed his desire for the tribe to keep up with its success now that it can once again provide its customers with gaming and sports betting options. The fresh agreement represents an extension of the previous partnership between the two parties.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the MGCB has announced that it will continue to supervise the conduct of fair and honest gaming that can protect the interests of Michigan’s citizens.</p>
<p>Hannahville Indian Community Preserves and Enhances the Community</p>
<p>The Hannahville Indian Community in Wilson, Michigan is a fast-expanding entity with a clear goal to preserve and improve their community’s existence in terms of social and economic development, and cultural growth.</p>
<p>The tribe continued its growth from a struggling community that survived using minimal federal funds into a prosperous community that turned into a driving force for the Central Upper Peninsula ever since gaming was officially launched in the 1980s.</p>
<p>As of June 3, 2013, the tribe’s Enrolled Tribal Membership reached the 891 mark, going up 3% in the last 11 years, with 37 adopted individuals adopted into the tribe. The number of Registered Descendants reached 439 as of June 3, with 106 new registrations since 2010.</p>
<p>The MGCB announced the official launch of online sports betting and gambling operations in the state in January 2021.</p>
