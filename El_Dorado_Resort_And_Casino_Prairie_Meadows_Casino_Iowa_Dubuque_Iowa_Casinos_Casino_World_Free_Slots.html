    <h1>El Dorado Resort And Casino Prairie Meadows Casino Iowa Dubuque Iowa Casinos Casino World Free Slots</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I registered at Mr Bet Casino on Sunday 11/20/2022 and used the 10 euros without deposit. I managed to wager the amount and ended up with â‚¬50 real money. A minimum deposit is required to make a withdrawal. I made the minimum deposit of 10 euros, I now had 60 euros. I then applied for a payout of 60 euros. A little later I got the information that my account was blocked due to a multi account and that I will not get my winnings paid out. And I understand that too, that I don't get the winnings. I noticed that I had already registered an account there a good year ago. If you're stupid, you can't do anything. I was not aware of this multi accounts.</p>
<p>So let's get to the real point:</p>
<p>The casino also refused me the 10 euro deposit. I didn't do a single spin with the 10 euros and the full 60 euros (10 euros deposit + 50 euros profit) were always visible in my user account.</p>
<p>Can the casino also refuse my deposit of 10 euros? Is that legal? I understand that I don't get my winnings, but I find it very questionable that they keep the money themselves, where I never had the chance to use it. I know the amount is ridiculously small, but this is a matter of principle. Can you take a look? Thanks!</p>
