    <h1>Hon Dah Resort Casino Casinos In Lake Charles La Posh Casino Login Montego Bay Casino Niagara Seneca</h1>

<p>Global provider of solutions and gaming technology International Game Technology (IGT) announced today the appointment of Gil Rotem as President of iGaming.</p>
<p>Development and Expansion of PlayCasino</p>
<p>With the appointment effective immediately, Gil Rotem is responsible for the further development and expansion of IGT’s business across online casino, poker and bingo business, IGT PlayCasino, and will report directly to the recently appointed as CEO of IGT Digital &amp; Betting Enrico Drago.</p>
<p>The IGT PlayCasino business continues to grow at a rapid pace, and it offers many of the gaming industry’s highest-performing and most-recognized game titles.” Enrico Drago, CEO, Digital &amp; Betting, IGT</p>
<p>Embracing the “tremendous opportunity” to lead and represent the IGT PlayCasino portfolio of online casino games, poker and bingo together with Drago, Rotem underscored the “outstanding results” PlayCasino had delivered so far in “this period of global transformation in the gaming industry.”</p>
<p>“I look forward to helping propel future growth with IGT PlayCasino as IGT demonstrates the value and promise of its newly established Digital &amp; Betting segment to customers and shareholders,” Rotem outlined.</p>
<p>We expect continued double-digit growth from IGT PlayCasino, and Gil Rotem’s vision and experience can help us remain well-positioned for continued leadership in iGaming, poker and bingo.” Enrico Drago, CEO, Digital &amp; Betting, IGT</p>
<p>Previous Experience</p>
<p>The addition of Rotem to the executive ranks at IGT brings nearly 20 years of industry experience to the technology and solutions provider, some of which gained at 888 and bet365, where his responsibilities included strategic planning at board level and operations, as well as delivering growth and product optimizations.</p>
<p>Rotem’s most recent work as an independent consultant for an online sports betting company saw him spearhead the development and delivery of dozens of exclusive game titles for the company’s proprietary online gaming and jackpot platform.</p>
<p>The appointment of Rotem is the latest high-profile figure that joined the ranks at IGT, following in the footsteps of the appointment of bookmaking industry veteran Joe Asher as President of Sports Betting last month to help further propel IGT PlaySports across North American markets.</p>
<p>In the US, IGT PlaySports recently announced an agreement with Oneida Nation that allowed the sports betting solution to power the tribe’s sportsbook at Oneida Casino in Greenbay, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>IGT also signed a strategic partnership deal with Puerto Rico-based WinIn brand that would see the company’s PlaySports power any future online and retail sportsbook operations of the brand.</p>
