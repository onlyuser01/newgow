<p>BetMGM has announced a new partnership with IGT and Sony Pictures Television to introduce its very own Wheel of Fortune Casino, a new online casino that is branded and styled after the popular American TV game show. The new casino will rely on the successful branding and positive association built for the game show to market itself, backed by BetMGM’s industry-related expertise and deeper understanding of the market.</p>
<p>Everyone Gets to Show up on Wheel of Fortune</p>
<p>As such, the Wheel of Fortune online casino will actually come along with an exclusive focus on this style of game. There will be 250 different Wheel of Fortune-inspired games that have been developed over the past 25 years. Commenting on this partnership, BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost said that Wheel of Fortune is a fantastic game show that is watched by millions of people.</p>
<p>BetMGM is as such honored to collaborate with Sony Pictures Television and the IGT family to make sure that this unique TV experience is now available as a playable casino. He added:</p>
<p>“Once live, Wheel of Fortune Casino will offer players the excitement of their favorite game show and real-money wagering in the palm of their hand.” BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost</p>
<p>The casino is set to debut in New Jersey this year and it will come along with a number of IGT games that have focused on this popular game show. There will be “other” themed games, although details are still forthcoming and we will have to wait and see. The biggest focus will naturally be on the games that do in some way emulate the show and bring it to casino aficionados.</p>
<p>Leveraging the Wheel of Fortune Brand</p>
<p>IGT Digital and Betting CEO Enrico Drago welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with BetMGM as well. He said that the IGT Wheel of Fortune slot brand is one of the company’s proudest achievements and that it was a fantastic opportunity to be able to team up with BetMGM and Sony Pictures to work on this. Drago further added:</p>
<p>“The Wheel of Fortune brand has been synonymous with slot gaming for more than 25 years and this unprecedented brand-led online casino, driven by BetMGM’s compelling platform and promotional capabilities, is well-positioned to engage and entertain new and long-time players.” IGT Digital and Betting CEO Enrico Drago</p>
<p>Drago said that the current partnership was part of the PlayDigital strategy which involves leveraging established products with third-party companies to achieve even bigger and stronger success.</p>
