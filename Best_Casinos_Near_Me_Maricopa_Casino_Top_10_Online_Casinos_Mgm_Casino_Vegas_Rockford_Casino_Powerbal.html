    <h1>Best Casinos Near Me Maricopa Casino Top 10 Online Casinos Mgm Casino Vegas Rockford Casino Powerbal</h1>

<p>Surviving last night's drawing, the Powerball jackpot is estimated to hit $152 million or $66.8 million in cash for the drawing on Wednesday</p>
<p>The October 11 drawing of Powerball, America’s favorite lottery, completely changed the life of one lucky player. Guessing correctly all white balls along with the red Powerball, the lottery player hit the game’s second-largest jackpot, a staggering $1.76 billion. Since the drop of the whopping jackpot, the game hasn’t seen another winner of the grand prize, allowing it to surpass $150 million.</p>
<p>There was no one that guessed correctly all white balls, 19, 22, 34, 66, 69 along with the red Powerball 5, from the drawing on Monday. This enabled the Powerball jackpot to grow further to an estimated $152 million for the upcoming drawing scheduled for Wednesday, November 1, 2023.</p>
<p>While the $152 million sum represents an initial payment followed by installments, if the lucky user selects a cash option that is also possible. Provided that a player guesses correctly all balls from the drawing tomorrow and decides to take home a lump cash sum, they would be looking at some $66.8 million. While that’s far from the mouth-watering $150 million, it is still a life-changing payout.</p>
<p>Nobody Won a Million-Dollar Prize on Monday</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the billion-dollar jackpot undoubtedly attracted millions of players. With everyone hoping to win the grand prize, the overall odds of securing a win from Powerball are 1 in 24.9. On the other hand, the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million.</p>
<p>While the billion-dollar drawing from earlier this month saw more than 5 million winning tickets, the drawing on Monday night saw nearly 290,000 winning tickets with standard prizes. Surprisingly, nobody guessed correctly the five white balls for a $1 million prize.</p>
<p>On the other hand, only 5 tickets guessed correctly four white balls and the red Powerball to take home $50,000 each. Two lucky winners last night secured a Power Play Prize, taking home $150,000 each.</p>
<p>Guessing correctly four white balls granted 140 lottery players a prize of $100 each. The same prize was collected by an additional 414 lottery players who guessed correctly three white balls along with the red Powerball on Monday.</p>
<p>The biggest number of winners was within the lowest prize tier. Some 188,655 players collected a $4 prize each, while 68,706 took a Power Play Prize of $12 each by guessing correctly only the red Powerball from last night’s drawing.</p>
