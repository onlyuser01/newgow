<p>Lady Luck Games, a Stockholm-based iGaming studio, has inked a new distribution agreement with content distributor CYG Pte Ltd. The new deal will help Lady Luck expand its content to Asia and power local operators.</p>
<p>Lady Luck Joins Forces with CYG Pte Ltd</p>
<p>As per the agreement, CYG Pte Ltd will help Lady Luck Games expand its footprint in Asia. This deal is in line with Lady Luck’s existing plans to target the region. Two weeks ago, prominent Asian investors backed LL Lucky Games, the studio’s parent company.</p>
<p>Overall, Lady Luck continues to be focused on becoming a cash-flow-positive company and is working hard to expand its reach. Some of its recent endeavors include a partnership with Bojoko and the top-tier gambling aggregator iSoftBet.</p>
<p>CYG Pte Ltd is a company with significant experience in Asia, which it will leverage to help Lady Luck’s iGaming titles reach a diverse audience of local iGaming enthusiasts. The distributor will also benefit a great deal from the agreement as it will be able to expand its rich portfolio of best-in-class titles.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Glad to Be Working Together</p>
<p>Mads Jørgensen, LL Lucky Games AB’s co-founder and chief executive officer, spoke about the Swedish company’s aim to expand in Asia.</p>
<p>Only two weeks after announcing our prominent new strategic Asian investor in LL Lucky games AB, I am proud to announce a new partnership for regulated Asian markets that will have a massive impact on our business strategy. Mads Jørgensen, CEO, LL Lucky Games</p>
<p>Jørgensen described CYG Pte Ltd as a “significant partner with many years of experience” and praised the company for its understanding of the Asian gambling market. According to Lady Luck’s CEO, the agreement is a huge step toward the studio’s ambition to become cash flow positive.</p>
<p>The integration has already started and players will be able to enjoy more and more of our leading content in the coming months. Mads Jørgensen, CEO, LL Lucky Games</p>
<p>Michael Li, CEO of CYG Pte Ltd, also commented on the agreement. He said that his team is very proud of teaming up with Lady Luck Games and is looking forward to launching its content in Asia. Li lauded Lady Luck as a top-quality iGaming studio and said that their products will greatly enrich CYG Pte Ltd’s content network.</p>
<p>We strive to offer the best possible content and user experience, and believe with its carefully designed games and mechanics, Lady Luck Games is set to take the Asian regulated markets by storm. Michael Li, CEO, CYG Pte Ltd</p>
<p>A month ago, Lady Luck Games announced its first Megaways title, SpinJoy Society Megaways.</p>
