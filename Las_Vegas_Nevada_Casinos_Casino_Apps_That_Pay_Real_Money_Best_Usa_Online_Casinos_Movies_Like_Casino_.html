<p>The FC Cincinnati vs. Philadelphia Union Eastern Conference semifinal is on the program on Saturday, November 25, at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati is the Supporters Shield winner for the 2023 MLS regular season – the boys from Ohio collected more points than anyone else in the league. They finished with a 20-9-5 record or 69 points. Their record at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati was 13-2-2 which accounts for 41 points. What this practically means is that roughly 60% of their points in the regular season happened on their turf.</p>
<p>One of the teams against which they won all three points at home is Philadelphia Union. When these two met in Ohio back in April, the hosts won 1-0, with their best player Luciano Acosta scoring the only goal. Can they do something similar almost eight months later?</p>

<p>Reasons Why FC Cincinnati’s Odds are -110</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati is seen as the odds-on favorite in the 2023 MLS Eastern Conference semifinal, which isn’t much of a surprise. First of all, the boys from Cincy have been phenomenal this season, the evidence being that they’re the ones to win the 2023 MLS Supporters’ Shield.</p>
<p>Their playmaker Luciano Acosta finished the regular season as the league’s second-most prolific scorer with 17 goals to his name. The Argentine attacking midfielder also recorded 13 assists, which made him the fourth-best assist maker in the regular season.</p>

<p>Defensively, FC Cincinnati was one of the best teams in the league (and still is), and the man most responsible for that is Matt Miazga. The evidence of this is that the USMNT center-back is the man who won the 2023 MLS Defender of the Year.</p>
<p>Apart from doing great in the regular season, Cincy’s players have also been dominant in the playoffs. They knocked the NY Red Bulls out of the competition by beating them 3-0 in Cincinnati and winning the penalty lottery in the rematch on the road.</p>
<p>Can Philadelphia Union Cause a Sensation?</p>
<p>Philadelphia Union has some really good players on the roster, particularly when it comes to creating plays. Hungarian playmaker Daniel Gazdag has been a true midfield general for them in 2023, while Julian Carranza has been incredible in front of the opposition goal.</p>
<p>With such players on the roster, it’s no surprise this team has reached the 2023 Eastern Conference semis. But can they take it a step further? Judging by the Philadelphia Union odds for the November 25 game, the answer is no.</p>
<p>The reason isn’t just that Cincy is a great team, but also that the game is played in Ohio. The thing is that Philly hasn’t been great on the road lately. Sure, these guys did beat the New England Revolution 1-0 in their most recent game, but before that, they lost two and drew two away games.</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati vs. Philadelphia Union Prediction</p>
<p>These two are very similar teams, but FC Cincinnati is simply better. We think that the Union would probably stand a chance if the game was played in Philly. However, at TQL Stadium, we think they won’t be able to do anything.</p>
<p>Pick: FC Cincinnati</p>
