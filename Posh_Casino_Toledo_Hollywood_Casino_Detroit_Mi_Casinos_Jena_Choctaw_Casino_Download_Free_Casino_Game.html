<p>OpenArena sportsbooks will benefit from tailored engagement tools brought on by Xtremepush as part of an agreement with Scientific Games.</p>
<p>SG Taps Xtremepush Expertise to Create Personalized Engagement Products</p>
<p>Scientific Games has signed an agreement with engagement solutions company Xtremepush to provide affiliated sportsbooks available on the OpenArena platform with advanced multichannel and player-oriented engagement options.</p>
<p>As a result, any sportsbooks currently using the OpenArena platform will be able to benefit from Xtremepush’s dedicated offering that creates tailored engagement solutions and leads to better overall results across multiple channels, including but not limited to push notifications, email, and SMS.</p>
<p>Clients who tap in both solutions will be able to sync up data and work on actionable insights that are updated in real-time, creating relevant and bespoke messages throughout a customer’s lifecycle and leading to better bottom-line results.</p>
<p>Xtremepush prides itself on building a product that leads the way in player engagement personalization and has multichannel capabilities that allow hundreds of sportsbooks around the world to benefit and approach customers in new and compelling ways. According to the companies, OpenArena customers will have an opportunity to boost wallet-share at scale.</p>
<p>Adding a Personalized Engagement Approach for Sportsbooks</p>
<p>Addressing this partnership, Xtremepush, director of partnerships Robbie Sexton, said that teaming up with OpenArena and, by extension, its clients was an exciting opportunity for the firm as well. “Our solution will allow operators to engage players through personalized, real-time campaigns alongside the full range of live sporting events that Scientific Games provides, and significantly enhance the sports betting experience for all players,” Sexton added.</p>
<p>At the same time, SG SVP of sportsbook and digital Keith O’Loughlin argued that Xtremepush was a natural pick for the company’s OpenArena platform. Thanks to Xtremepush’s solutions, Scientific Games can effectively offer sports fans a highly customizable product that adds value but comes in a secure, engaging, and entertaining form.</p>
<p>The first quarter of 2021 turned out a success for Scientific Games, which saw gains in numerous verticals. Scientific Games has been pushing to improve its overall offer, working on both the iGaming and sports betting vertical.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Scientific Games teamed up with Pixiu Gaming, a games developer, enabling the company to distribute Pixiu’s titles through its OpenGaming platform.</p>
