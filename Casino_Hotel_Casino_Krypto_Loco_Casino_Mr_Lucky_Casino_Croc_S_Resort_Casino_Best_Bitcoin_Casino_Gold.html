    <h1>Casino Hotel Casino Krypto Loco Casino Mr Lucky Casino Croc S Resort Casino Best Bitcoin Casino Gold</h1>

<p>On September 1st of this year, I attempted to withdraw $776 in winnings from the newly opened Golden Nugget Online Casino in Pennsylvania. I registered with this casino a couple of days after its opening date in August of this year. I still, to this day, have not received the requested withdrawal. I initiated a customer support ticket when I did not receive a notification of the request. It was at this time I was informed that my account was restricted. I was informed that I must submit bank statements and a utility bill. These documents were requested and submitted multiple times. I even submitted multiple coupes of my ID for verification. Every time Golden Nugget requested these documents, they were supplied in a timely manner. Every submission was met with a new request for an additional banking statement or resend some of the same ones. When it seemed like I was finally getting to a resolution, I was asked to answer seven questions from the casino regarding their safe play check-in. This was said to be due to questions concerning my declined deposits from insufficient funds. I returned this questionnaire within the required time frame. I received an email stating that the answers were satisfactory and that my account would be reviewed to help remove any additional restrictions. The next email I was sent was concerning a DraftKings issue that arose. It was stated that this was the only problem, and if resolved, it would end the restriction on my account. This was quickly resolved, and I was led to believe that my account would be cleared and I could proceed with my withdrawal. However, I attempted to log in to my Golden Nugget account only to be still on restriction. I was given a new customer service player advocate when I filed a new customer support ticket. This new advocate once again required the same bank statements, and questionnaire, and then proceeded to stop responding to my questions pertaining to the restrictions on my account. I have not been able to gain any further headway in the matter. I have been overwhelmed for the past three months with multiple advocates insisting that I submit these documents only to be seemingly stonewalled with explanations and false promises, then neglected and left with no choice but to restart the process again. All necessary documentation upon request. As well as dates and times where information was provided through emails.</p>
