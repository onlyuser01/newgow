    <h1>Free Bonus No Deposit Casinos Gila River Casino Santan Mountain Metaspins Casino Cashman Casino Game</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming's partners will now have the opportunity to benefit from a brand new type of content brought to them courtesy of Livespins, an innovator in the way people watch and interact with iGaming content.</p>
<p>Moving forward, operators that utilize the Relax Gaming aggregation platform will also have the opportunity to benefit from Livespins’ excellent live slot experiences. Livespins has become a veritable casino vertical in its own right as it allows players to watch as others – usually prominent streamers – play slots and bet alongside them.</p>
<p>This process is accessible, easy, and very easy on the purse as it allows players to pick the amount they are willing to bet at the same time as streamers. This partnership between Relax’s aggregation platform and Livespins builds upon the existing collaboration between the two companies which sees Relax titles streamed through the Livespins lobby.</p>
<p>Now, there will be a whole lot more titles that Livespins’ streamers may pick from to entertain their audiences and bring a socially-charged experience to online casinos. Livespins has also developed a number of promotional tools that allows the company to further engage and boost retention rates, elevating the gameplay for players.</p>
<p>The opportunity was naturally welcomed by Relax Gaming CPO Shelley Hannah who said that Livespins is a partner that helps underpin the company’s offer and bring more entertaining options to players and operators.</p>
<p>Hannah confirmed that players have been interested in seeing more streaming content and products, which is precisely what this tie-up would be able to bring. Hannah’s words also echo the opinion of Livespins and its Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) who spoke to Casino Guru News recently and noted that streaming wasn’t just the future, it was here and now.</p>
<p>Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen was similarly excited to see this alliance form. He noted that Relax Gaming is one of the biggest suppliers in the industry and as such it’s one of the most important agreements that Livespins had put in place.</p>
<p>"This partnership drastically increases the reach of Livespins, allowing more operators than ever before to integrate our solution into their casino lobbies and leverage the huge demand for streaming content among players across the world," Pedersen noted.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming in the meantime definitely has plenty of exciting options to offer with Money Train 4 among the latest and most highly-anticipated releases that launched exclusively with StarCasino in Italy at first.</p>
