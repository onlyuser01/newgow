<p>Becricdotcom Is A Fraudster &amp; Cheater Company, &amp; So Is Mouli Pratibha, Owner Of the Youtube Channel - Mouli Pratibha Zone - youtubedotcom/@Pramo1030/. Becricdotcom Didn't Pay My Rs. 300</p>
<p>Website: becric.com</p>
<p>This fuc**king, Shameless, And Cheater Company - becric.com Owner &amp; Staff Must Be Punished So Severely That No Online Casinos Dare To Cheat The Public Online With No Fear Of Anyone &amp; Same Should Be Done To Their Paid Agents Such As Mouli Pratibha, Youtube Channel name - Mouli Pratibha Zone - youtubedotcom/@Pramo1030/</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I made a withdrawal request of Rs. 300, Order Id: bad823daab071671, at around 11:20 AM six days ago on 14th May 2023, from my Becric account, which was my principal money &amp; no profit, and I have not received it in my given credit card account: x8114, nor has it been credited to my Becric account, as written in 24 hours.</p>
<p>So, where did it go? To fraudster &amp; scammer Becric's account.</p>
<p>Becric is here for you to FU***CK you &amp; keep your money!</p>
<p>Kindly confirm the same boldly that BECRIC kept my money.</p>
<p>If Rs. 300 was transferred, why didn't it reach my credit card account? Provide me with a reference number for the credit if done from your side, as my bank is not a scammer like you.</p>
<p>On complaining above to the Becric Chat agent on Becric.com, I was blocked for some hours, &amp; I have not gotten any reply from supportatbecric.com and the chat agents Claire &amp; Leeha's profile pictures, showing cleavage and nude back clearly prove that BECRIC doesn’t have any ethics. Both chat agents didn’t provide any reference ID for the Rs. 300 transfer done to my credit card, which they claimed as a success from their fraud records!</p>
<p>For your money, family, peace of mind, and time-saving, don’t play at BECRIC, as they will not pay you any money and will show success for withdrawal at their side, but it will be done successfully to their account and not yours.</p>
<p>I did this Rs. 300 investment and the previous one too of the same amount (total Rs. 600) after the fuc<strong>ker Mouli Pratibha, their paid agent, showed proof that BECRIC paid to him, the paid and shameless fuc</strong>king agent of BECRIC who brings gullible new bettors who can be cheated by BECRIC because of him showing successful money credit proof that is done to BECRIC agents only and not to normal people whose money is shared by Becric and its paid promotional agents.</p>
