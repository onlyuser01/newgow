    <h1>Casino Hotel In Reno Fitz Casino Hotel Online Casino Usa No Deposit Bonus Royal River Casino Hotel R</h1>

<p>I can't say I understand who wrote you on behalf of the Vulkan Vegas Casino.</p>
<p>But allow me to say, that:</p>
<p>You should never register more than one account, as I'm sure you know, it's violating the Terms and Conditions. If you do, make sure you will not take several deposit bonuses because in case you win, all your winnings may or will be confiscated and accounts closed.</p>
<p>I believe that you also know that the casino can't restrict you from registering several accounts if the full KYC is not triggered by registering process. And it usually isn't. The KYC is commonly triggered by the first withdrawal.</p>
<p>So Yes, technically, you can create multiple accounts but the moment you register the first one, you're accepting the Terms and Conditions saying you WILL NOT create another account.</p>
<p>Please, keep that in mind.</p>
