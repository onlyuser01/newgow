<p>This collaboration will leverage TrueLayer’s payments product in the UK, offering William Hill customers convenient instant pay-ins and payouts</p>
<p>In a strategic move to enhance its customer experience, William Hill, one of the UK’s leading gaming operators, has partnered with TrueLayer, a payments technology provider. This mutually beneficial agreement will significantly bolster TrueLayer’s market presence, allowing it to stand out amidst harsh competition. Meanwhile, William Hill will benefit from instant bank payment capabilities, improving client onboarding and retention.</p>
<p>Customers Gain Access to Faster and Safer Payments</p>
<p>The cornerstone of this new partnership is the “Instant Bank Transfer” option, designed to streamline the payment process for William Hill customers. With this feature, users can promptly deposit funds into their betting accounts and seamlessly transfer their winnings back to their bank accounts swiftly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Moreover, TrueLayer ensures that all payments are authenticated directly with the players’ banks, guaranteeing a seamless experience and promoting security and reliability in all transactions. William Hill payments manager Laura Manning noted that this new addition was instrumental in improving customer satisfaction, lauding TrueLayer’s agile integration capabilities.</p>
<p>By using (TrueLayer’s) unparalleled payment solutions, we’re able to… provide reliable and secure services and keep our commitments to helping our customers stay in control. Laura Manning, William Hill payments manager</p>
<p>Collaborating with TrueLayer is another significant milestone in William Hill’s commitment to its UK customers. A recent deal with leading supplier Pragmatic Play substantially enhanced the operator’s live casino portfolio with engaging live casino experiences. While the new and exciting live dealer titles will be instrumental in onboarding new clients, TrueLayer’s smooth payment experience will ensure they keep returning.</p>
<p>TrueLayer Demonstrates the Value of Its Offerings</p>
<p>A recent study by TrueLayer conducted in collaboration with YouGov revealed that 8 out of 10 European players prioritize quick payouts when choosing a betting provider. Recognizing this trend, the technology provider has redoubled its focus on rapid, secure, and convenient payment solutions, providing its customers with an unmatched experience.</p>
<p>TrueLayer’s collaboration with William Hill follows a deal with digital payments solutions provider OKTO, joining forces to ensure a secure and reliable payment process. TrueLayer VP of iGaming Roberto Villani was excited to partner with a leading operator, noting that working with William Hill would help demonstrate the provider’s best-in-class solution.</p>
<p>End users value instant experiences: by embracing the innovations of open banking, William Hill has shown the importance of prioritizing the player experience. Roberto Villani, TrueLayer VP of iGaming</p>
<p>The collaboration between William Hill and TrueLayer perfectly highlights the continuously expanding network of partnerships that form the bedrock of the gambling industry. This deal should significantly bolster both companies, elevating their offerings above the competition. It will also substantially enhance player experiences, providing them with much-needed safety during their gaming journey.</p>
