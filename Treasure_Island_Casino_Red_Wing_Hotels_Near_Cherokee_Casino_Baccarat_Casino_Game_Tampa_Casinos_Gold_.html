    <h1>Treasure Island Casino Red Wing Hotels Near Cherokee Casino Baccarat Casino Game Tampa Casinos Gold</h1>

<p>I won a little less than five hundred dollars and went through the steps needed to get my winnings. I had spoke on the phone with customer service 3 to 4 times to verify they got my documents and that they had everything they needed, not once did anyone mention that my account was locked out and that "my bank" did a reverse payment until tonight I attempted to log in and it said I could not contact customer support. Contacted support, was told they had the right to refuse customers and that "my bank" did this reversely, called my bank and was told the merchant did the reversely and that due to the card I used the bank cannot even due reversely which is in my terms and conditions. Called Customer support and told them what I had found out, and that my bank is happy to talk to them and provide the documentation showing they El Royal Casino was in fact the reason my bank account was credit back that deposit I made, why cause I had won $500. If this Casino is welling to do this with only $500 I don't even wish a Jackpot on anyone playing with this online joke of a casino. Really, on $500 that's just sad. Last thing I was told was to email with my complaint. So email I shall, I have all the information proving they are trying to pull a fast one. PLAYERS BEWARE CASINO IS HARD UP ON MY $500 LEGIT WINNINGS</p>
