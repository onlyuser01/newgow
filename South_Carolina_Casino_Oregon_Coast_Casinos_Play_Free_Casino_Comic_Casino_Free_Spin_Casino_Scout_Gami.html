    <h1>South Carolina Casino Oregon Coast Casinos Play Free Casino Comic Casino Free Spin Casino Scout Gami</h1>

<p>Daily fantasy sport (DFS) and betting solutions provider Scout Gaming announced today it entered into an agreement with eFanGage to boost fan engagement on its venue-based platform rolled out to bars, restaurants, stadia, and arenas in the US.</p>
<p>DFS and Social Sportsbook</p>
<p>The agreement between the company that “close[s] the gap between sports betting and fantasy sports to create significant value” and Las Vegas-based eFanGage will see Scout Gaming’s free-to-play social sportsbook and DFS solution integrated into the platform that powers engagement with sports fans and bettors across entertainment venues nationwide.</p>
<p>“I’m glad that we can add another deal with our new social sportsbook. Arthur Backal is well-reputed in the hospitality sector and his ideas with eFanGage are groundbreaking.” Andreas Ternström, CEO, Scout Gaming</p>
<p>A joint venture of SCCG Management and Backal Hospitality Group, eFanGage will enhance its product offering via Scout’s latest simulated social sportsbook and fantasy sports proposition to empower its venue partners and boost the level of customer socialization, engagement, and retention. Besides simulated sportsbook and DFS, eFanGage’s platform rolled across entertainment venues in the US powers esports.</p>
<p>“We are happy to reach an agreement with Scout Gaming, after having selected them as a preferred supplier late last year. We will deliver innovative technology containing a flexible gaming platform to enable social engagement towards our assets, including restaurants, bars, and other venues. As sports betting arises sharply across the country, we see this as a perfect bridge for us to onboard new fans and participants.” Arthur Backal, Co-Founder, eFanGage</p>
<p>Contests and Tournaments</p>
<p>The social sportsbook and DFS solution of the listed on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm First North gaming technology supplier allows its users to take advantage of a variety of contests and tournaments, win prizes and collect rewards in the form of a virtual currency that is easily exchanged for perks, discounts and other items.</p>
<p>Scout Gaming’s DFS and sports betting platform made its debut in the US earlier this month after the Malta-licensed tech supplier entered into a deal with the Masters Cup Series to offer its products and services aimed at both online and retail operators to the billiards series and enable it to introduce to fans of billiards next-gen, sports betting-like experiences that do not require them to put their money on the line.</p>
<p>Outside of the US, Scout Gaming, which is also licensed in the UK, offers the only liquidity network for fantasy sports in Europe and boasts a business portfolio featuring some of the largest online operators.</p>
