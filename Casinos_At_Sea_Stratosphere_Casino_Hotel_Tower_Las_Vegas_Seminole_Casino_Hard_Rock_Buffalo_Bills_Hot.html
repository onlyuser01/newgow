    <h1>Casinos At Sea Stratosphere Casino Hotel Tower Las Vegas Seminole Casino Hard Rock Buffalo Bills Hot</h1>

<p>Turbo Stars has had transformative past years. Although the journey still continues, we have a catch-up with Vadim Potapenko, Head of Sales, a passionate gamer himself who understands the ins and outs of the industry and has a lot to offer. Potapenko explains how standards in the gambling industry have shifted towards honesty and openness and how provably fair games can help businesses achieve this new golden standard. Turbo Stars has long prioritized responsibility, reliability and flexibility as the company’s main values, and this is what makes it highly competitive in this exciting brave new world in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Q: You are a comprehensive supplier of solutions for the iGaming industry. Your platform relies on provably fair games and innovative technology to keep customers satisfied and offer them an advantage over the competition. Could we explore this a little further and help us understand how TurboStars.io’s products work?</p>
<p>Thanks for the question! I would like to answer with a little background. Less than a year ago it was decided to unite the development of our various solutions under one brand name –Turbo Stars. Three of our stars - Turbo Games, Turbo Sportsbook and Turbo Platform combine over 5 years of experience in the gambling sphere. Our main goal is to completely close the need to open an iGaming platform with its own fast games and a sportsbook. This is what we do every day. We are strong at developing our own provably fair games, providing unique sportsbook solutions and developing gaming platforms.</p>
<p>Q: The provably fair concept is an interesting one, but as players in the casino world, there may be people who are confused by this specific phrasing – "provably fair." Aren’t all games supposed to be fair in online casinos, and why does Turbo Games use this specific term to describe your own games?</p>
<p>Since the first casino exists, it has been declared that winning or losing depends only on luck. But how to check it? Provably Fair technology gave the opportunity to know if each game round was random and fair. Now it is a standard for most fast (as well-known as instant) games. Both the user and the casino support can check any bet during the game session. The implementation of this technology was allowed due to blockchain industry development, coz for hashing this technology is used. Honesty and openness are becoming global requirements, we like to maintain this at the business level, so we declare it as our advantage.</p>
<p>Q: How are your product offers different from what other B2B suppliers on the market do for their clients right now?</p>
<p>The main thing that differentiates Turbo Stars from competitors is our interest in bringing your idea to success. As I said, we have a lot of experience in platform development, design, marketing, and gaming events so we are ready to share it with partners. Turbo Stars offer a full range of services to numerous online casinos and sportsbooks worldwide. Responsibility, reliability and flexibility have become our main values.</p>
<p>Q: What are the main challenges in demonstrating the TurboStars.io’s solutions and games and their advantages? Do you think there is bias in terms of adopting solutions by new companies in the iGaming sector?</p>
<p>The instant games market is growing and developing every day, so it is really important to offer the industry fast, high-quality and high-margin solutions. For example, we offer a brand customization option for Turbo Games. For the casino user, it looks like in-house development. It is also worth mentioning that we have developed customizable sportsbook software. We integrate widgets into the platform so bettors can see and use them in any corner of the product! This smart tool allows us to make better results.</p>
<p>If we talk about our product, the main difficulty is to increase the awareness of the new Turbo Stars brand. Gambling partners know our products under other names and now we are working hard to present all the advantages under one hood.</p>
<p>Q: What does TurboStars.io expect from 2023 to bring and are you happy with your progress so far?</p>
<p>We would like to enter new markets and present our product there. Also, as I said, it will be necessary to increase the visibility of Turbo Stars by attending conferences and events with partners. By the way, soon we will attend the iGB conference in Amsterdam, if you are planning to be there, I would be happy to talk and show you live how our products work.</p>
