<p>Wind Creek Bethlehem has strengthened its online footprint through another partnership with Scientific Games, this time focusing on the operator’s iGaming business.</p>
<p>SG Now Powers Wind Creek’s iGaming Portfolio in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Scientific Games has launched its portfolio of top-notch iGaming products on Wind Creek’s online gaming platform in Pennsylvania. The supplier is empowering Wind Creek with a distinct selection from its OpenGaming ecosystem, which pools together some of the best games in the industry and allows partner casinos to immediately access award-winning titles.</p>
<p>Thanks to this tie-up, Wind Creek Bethlehem is effectively launching a number of established games, including 88 Fortunes, Dancing Drums, and Raging Rum, and picking from 3,000 titles found on its OpenGaming portfolio to bring to its player base.</p>
<p>The platform lists titles by numerous brands considered some of the best developers in the industry. Scientific Games is already involved with Bethlehem’s retail operations in the Keystone State, and the company is now reinforcing the iGaming platform, rendering Wind Creek’s gaming portal more appealing to mobile and desktop users.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Wind Creek chief marketing officer Ken Rohman said that the company was excited to be building on its existing relationship with Scientific Games, adding:</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Scientific Games provides our players access to their favorite games on the casino floor or their desktop and mobile devices. This is an exciting venture for us, and we look forward to inviting Pennsylvanians to our expanded online offering.” -Wind Creek Chief Marketing Officer Ken Rohman</p>
<p>The opportunity was welcomed by SG SVP and general manager of digital for US Cathryn Lai, who said that Scientific was pleased to be part of Wind Creek’s online gaming evolution and journey in the country.</p>
<p>OpenGaming is committed to creating a 360-degree experience across all channels for Wind Creek and its players, Lai said. Wind Creek Bethlehem will now be able to offer consumers everything, from classic titles to the most innovative online slots.</p>
