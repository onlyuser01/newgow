    <h1>The Casino La Cabana Beach Resort Casino Atlantic City Casino Hotels Wildwood Casino Cripple Creek C</h1>

<p>This is the post Lily1414 is referring to:</p>
<p>"Hi, At the beginning of the year i deposited around a thousand pounds on this site. On my deposit they added bonuses, now i never add bonuses, as i know the criteria for withdrawing when you have bonuses. I played a little, then saw an option to remove bonuses, i chose this option, it not only removed the bonuses but all my play money too, which was around 700pounds.I complained but was fobbed off and given general waffle. I was appointed a personal assistant but she just referring me to the online chat, who just palmed me off or referred to irrelevent policies that i could not find. I didnt play the site for a few months but deposited again, 1000 pounds stupidly, a few months later. I chose this site as i previously have had serious gambling issues and i am with gamstop, this site is not registered with gamstop.</p>
<p>The second time i deposited, i had winnings of around 2500pounds.I tried to withdraw but after many days of putting various different forms of ID in they still wouldnt allow me to withdraw. I had checked their of ID previously and it said ID card or passport. It did not say only passport for various regions, it just said passport or ID card. I had an ID card but no passport and had told them this many times. The communication lasted weeks, bad communication that is and i was told ID card was ok. Eventually i was told it had to be passport for uk, nowhere does it state that, so at more cost i ordered a passport. They knew i was trying to withdraw, whilst waiting i played a little more and got my winnings to around 4500.</p>
<p>My passport came and my withdrawal was pending and i played a little more. They had also said i would have to open a certain online bank account to withdraw, more and more reasons to stop from withdrawing. This had gone on for months now. I played for around 2hours and the money went, no wins at all, totally unfair.</p>
<p>I complained to all outlets but was just palmed off, this site is totally unregulated.</p>
<p>I asked for my account to be closed forever asap. They closed it but unbeknown to me they opened it a week later. They also continued to bombard me with offers and bonuses. This is after explaining to them when telling them to close the account, that i was a vulnerable gambler, who had serious gambling issues, with gambling debts and that i had been put into more debt gambling on their site.</p>
<p>I did put money on again, thats what gamblers do when your bombarded by offers etc, i lost. I complained andvasked why had my account been re opened.</p>
<p>This site is corrupt and unfair and does everything to stop you winning and withdrawing. I asked for some sort of refund, compensation but was denied.</p>
<p>Is there anything you can do please?"</p>
