<p>Sporting Kansas City booked its place in the Western Conference Wild Card match after beating Minnesota United in the final round of the 2023 MLS regular season.

<p>Sporting KC Confident of Beating the Quakes Again</p>
<p>Sporting Kansas City has a fantastic record against the San Jose Earthquakes, especially in games played in KC. In fact, on home turf, they’ve only suffered one defeat to the Quakes. And the loss in question happened back in 2015.</p>
<p>Bookies think they’re going to do it again, and it’s not just because of their good history against San Jose. It’s also because Sporting Kansas City’s players have been in top shape lately. They won three of their last four MLS games, scoring nine goals along the way.</p>
<p>In the final round of the regular season of the 2023 MLS, they defeated Minnesota United 3-1. Before that, the two were on equal points, meaning that if they didn’t win, they’d finish the season below the playoff zone.</p>
<p>San Jose Earthquakes Can’t be Proud of Their Form</p>
<p>The Quakes drew each of their last four games, each of which finished with 1-1 on the scoreboard. It’s not too bad, but the fact is that they’ve won just one game in the last ten MLS rounds.</p>
<p>The reason why they made it to the postseason is that the Portland Timbers failed in the final round. They lost to Houston Dynamo over the weekend, the result of which is that they finished just behind the Quakes with one point fewer.</p>
<p>They’re not in great shape, especially when it comes to games on the road. The last time they defeated someone in an away game was on October 20.</p>
<p>Sporting Kansas City vs. San Jose Earthquakes Prediction</p>
<p>The last time these two met at Children’s Mercy Park, the hosts won 3-0. It happened two months ago, and since then, the Quakes’ form has dipped even more. Further, Sporting KC’s attackers have upped their game over the last two months, which is why nothing but another easy home win would be a surprise.</p>
<p>Pick: Sporting Kansas City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
