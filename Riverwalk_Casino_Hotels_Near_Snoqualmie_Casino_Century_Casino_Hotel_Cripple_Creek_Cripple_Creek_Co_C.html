<p>A manager of a famous Las Vegas Strip restaurant was accused of stealing more than $100,000, according to a recent report.</p>
<p>Police Arrests Restaurant Manager over Theft Allegations</p>
<p>An arrest report from the Metropolitan Police Department, released by the Las Vegas Review-Journal alleges that Michael Moore, who served as a manager of the Sugar Factory at Fashion Show mall in Las Vegas, Nevada, stole more than $100,000 from the venue.</p>
<p>The theft allegedly occurred between August 30, 2021, and December 1, 2021, while the male was a general manager of the venue. Last week on Tuesday, Moore was arrested after a warrant from the police. He disputed the allegations and said he wasn’t involved in any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The suspect was reportedly released under supervision since then. However, Moore was charged with one count of theft over $100,000. A preliminary hearing on the charges against the man is scheduled for May 17, 2022.</p>
<p>Money Missing from Change Safe, Deposits</p>
<p>Speaking to the police, one supervisor described Moore as “was very calm, poised, and collected.” Overall, the losses of the venue amount to $100,073. From that total, $33,000 was missing from a change safe, while another $66,000 was missing from money deposits, the recent report reveals.</p>
<p>Moore was allegedly the only manager working every Monday between September 6 and October 4 last year. During that time, an armored transport collected bags of money from the venue. However, upon making a cross-reference, the company found that approximately a dozen bags went missing during that period. That makes approximately $66,000.</p>
<p>Moreover, the venue uncovered that another $33,000 was missing from a change safe. While speaking to the police, company executives alleged that Moore was seen on video taking money out of the safe but not returning them.</p>
<p>The Suspect Is Waiting Trial for Similar Allegations</p>
<p>Besides the recent charge, Moore was also allegedly involved in a “very similar case,” according to police officers. In the other case, the suspect was charged with 23 counts of theft and is waiting for a trial. The trial for that case is expected to take place in June.</p>
<p>In a separate unrelated case, a Las Vegas off-duty cop was arrested late last month. The police officer, Caleb Roger, was allegedly involved in a robbery at the Rio Hotel and Casino sportsbook. Other reports alleged that the same police officer was involved in more incidents dating back to January and November 2021.</p>
