<p>Nashville SC and Los Angeles FC are flying real high in the Western Conference, currently sitting in the #3 and #2 positions in the standings respectively. If LAFC beat Nashville SC on Sunday, July 17, they’d climb up to the top of the table. However, betting odds suggest that such a thing isn’t very likely to happen. Instead, odds favor Nashville SC to triumph.</p>
<p>To learn why that is the case and whether oddsmakers are wrong to think of the Tennessee-based team as the favorite, make sure to read our Nashville SC vs Los Angeles FC preview until the very end.</p>

<p>Bookies Favor Nashville SC to Win on Sunday</p>
<p>Nashville SC have collected 30 points from 20 MLS matches. That’s nine points fewer than Los Angeles FC, who have also played one game fewer than them. Nevertheless, bookmakers still think Nashville has a better chance to triumph on Sunday than their LA-based rival.</p>
<p>As Nashville SC is a brand-new MLS franchise, this team still hasn’t played against LAFC ever. However, this team does have a decent record against teams from the upper half of the table.</p>
<p>What needs to worry them ahead of the clash with LAFC is that they haven’t been playing great at home. In fact, there’s only one team in the Western Conference that’s collected fewer points at home than Nashville SC.</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC to Debut Its New Players?</p>
<p>The guys from LA are among the best in the MLS when it comes to playing on the road. Actually, LAFC is one of the best (if not the very best team) in the league. This team has a fantastic roster in 2022, with the biggest star being, so far, legendary Carlos Vela.</p>
<p>We say ‘so far’ because LAFC has recently made two huge singings. One of those is World Cup-winning Italian center-back Giorgio Chiellini who’s expected to make his debut on Sunday. The other signing is even more important – LAFC signed ex-Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>It’s still unclear when Bale is going to start playing for LAFC, with some reports suggesting it could happen in the clash with Nashville SC.</p>
<p>Nashville SC vs Los Angeles FC Prediction</p>
<p>LAFC players are much, much better than those playing for Nashville SC, even though Nashville’s players are among the MLS elite. With players like Vela, Chiellini, and Bale, LAFC look capable of defeating literally any team in the United States. Actually, in 2022, LAFC might be the very best team in the whole of the Americas.</p>
<p>Picks: Los Angeles FC to win; Over 2.5 goals</p>
