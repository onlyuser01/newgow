<p>Pariplay, a NeoGames subsidiary, has expanded its aggregation capabilities through the addition of a new partner, Caleta Gaming. As a result, the iGaming studio and its products will be incorporated into the roster of Pariplay’s Ignite platform and program.</p>
<p>Pariplay Adds New Upcoming Supplier to Ignite</p>
<p>Pariplay has earned a name for itself through the addition of a number of top-tier suppliers which now shape its motley family of products with Ignite. In turn, the company is capable of delivering the product throughout a global distribution network.</p>
<p>This means that partners who opt for the Ignite platform will have the tools necessary to deploy a large selection of curated and trusted iGaming studios and set up a business quickly. The games come with a complete suite of engagement solutions as well.</p>
<p>Caleta Gaming is still an emerging studio but one that has been deemed to offer a solid technological stack and creativity to be featured as part of the growing Ignite network. Thanks to this tie-up, Caleta Gaming will be able to quickly secure further positions with iGaming audiences that operate in whitelisted jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Ignite itself is a unique aggregation platform that supports games coded in different languages and enables quick access to the products featured on the platform. This leads to reduced costs and makes it easier for developers to access new markets and reach fresh audiences. Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris added:</p>
<p>Expanding our Ignite program is an important goal for us, and we want to add partners that ally with our goals and plans, and Caleta Gaming fits that description perfectly. Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris</p>
<p>He confirmed that the team at Pariplay is looking forward to seeing what the partnership will bring to both companies.</p>
<p>Caleta Gaming Will Access New Audiences</p>
<p>Caleta Gaming CEO and co-founder Fabíola Jaeger also joined and said that the company was pleased to be joining efforts with Pariplay. Jaeger praised Pariplay’s reputation in the industry and said that the Ignite opportunity will indeed enable Caleta to expand its reach and grow its player bases.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait to get started and look forward to expanding our global reach,” Jaeger added. Pariplay has added a number of prominent partners in recent weeks, including TopSpin Games and Smartsoft Gaming.</p>
