<p>Canadian media company theScore teams up for Ubisoft for special esports series</p>
<p>The partnership is intended at popularizing R6’s competitive status</p>
<p>theScore is also cleared for an official sportsbook launch in New Jersey</p>
<p>Ubisoft and theScore team up to raise Rainbow Six Siege’s profile as a competitive video gaming title in special video content series.</p>
<p>theScore Teams Up with Ubisoft for Esports Video Content</p>
<p>Ubisoft, a developer of popular game franchises, has teamed up with Canadian media company theScore to create exclusive video series content focusing on esports and the flagship title of the company – Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>Garnering significant popularity, R6 as the game is known by its acronym, has often been featured in Newzoo’s API for most watched content in 2019. This is a direct result of the developer’s commitment to introduce more esports opportunities for R6 players.</p>
<p>Rainbow 6 Esports Prize Pool update</p>
<p>✔️ $1,069,000 to be distributed to R6 esports</p>
<p>✔️ Pro League increased to $626,000 (season + Finals)</p>
<p>✔️ Challenger League increased to $73,500</p>
<p>✔️ Each R6 Minor increased to $75,000</p>
<p>✔️ US Major increased to $500,000 — Parker Mackay (@InterroTalks) May 9, 2019</p>
<p>Ubisoft has decided to up the ante for Rainbow Six Siege, giving the game an opportunity to become a full-blown competitive title at a time this seems to be the best way to market a new title – from Apex Legends to Teamfight Tactics.</p>
<p>Back to theScore partnership, R6 personalities – including community gurus and professional players – will all be part of the video series.</p>
<p>Esports Video Series Become More Popular</p>
<p>In December, 2018, American broadcast network CBSN aired “The Price of the Grind,” a movie dedicated to burnout among esports players and the physical and psychological toil that gamers shouldered. In the case of Ubisoft, the company will try to raise the prominence and spread awareness about its Pro League and international events featuring R6.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the company will air content on theScore’s dedicated YouTube channel which currently boats the impressive 900,000 subscribers and counting. Ubisoft considers this to be a wise investment, as theScore’s platform has generated 64 million views between March and May, pointing to an impressive 188% increase.</p>
<p>Here’s what theScore’s Aubrey Levy, VP of Marketing and Partnerships, had to say about the partnership:</p>
<p>‘[theScore has] a powerful reputation for highly engaging and dynamic video storytelling, providing competitive gaming fans globally with unrivalled access and insight into the titles, leagues, players and personalities they love.’</p>
<p>theScore and Its New Jersey Odyssey</p>
<p>Earlier in August, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (NJDGE) cleared theScore allowing the company to enter the market in a select few verticals. Should initial results be satisfactory, the regulator expects to give the company a full go-ahead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, theScore continues to work out the kinks of its esports business, leveraging its immense video content potential to drive results for partners such as Ubisoft.</p>
