<p>Provider of technology for the gaming and entertainment industry Win Systems announced Monday a new collaborative agreement with Gaming Laboratories International (GLI) to make the prestigious international laboratory its exclusive certification partner.</p>
<p>‘Looking Forward to Many More Years of Collaboration’</p>
<p>The new agreement between Win Systems and GLI extends their partnership to the tech supplier’s Gaming Division. The Malta-based technology supplier hired the services of GLI for the certification of its WIGOS casino management system and its game control and monitoring system several years ago.</p>
<p>“We have been working with Win Systems for more than 10 years, and we are grateful for the trust they are putting in our services by expanding our agreement and choosing to exclusively work with us, as part of their Gaming Division’s expansion strategy.” James R. Maida, CEO, GLI</p>
<p>The exclusive strategic alliance with GLI comes at a time when Win Systems has already begun to certify its first games and GLI chief executive officer Maida was “thankful to be part of their path to continued success…looking forward to many more years of collaboration.”</p>
<p>Business Built on Confidence and Trust</p>
<p>Also commenting on the exclusive certification agreement, Win Systems’ chief executive officer Eric Benchimol emphasized the company’s “confidence and security” that oozes from its products and solutions and transmits to its customers as “one of the secrets of Win Systems’ success.”</p>
<p>“Thanks to the exclusive agreement with GLI we will be able to extend the quality guarantee of the most prestigious laboratory in our sector also to our Gaming products, as we have been doing with all our systems.” Eric Benchimol, CEO, Win Systems</p>
<p>With over 25 years of industry experience and operations in more than 60 countries conducted by a global team of over 380 people, Win Systems has always aspired to offer its customers the most innovative and successful lottery and gaming solutions, built on the company’s ethos of integrity, trust, teamwork, courage, innovation, and diversity.</p>
<p>Aligning in values with Win Systems, GLI is seeking to provide world-class testing, certification, and professional services to the global gaming, wagering and lotteries industries, delivered with the highest level of integrity and independence. GLI’s laboratory locations are available on six continents and the company is holding international and US accreditations in compliance.</p>
<p>Its portfolio of clients includes gaming regulators, suppliers, and operators in 480 jurisdictions worldwide, relying on the company to test and certify equipment and deliver a level of service and expertise unmatched by any other certification business.</p>
