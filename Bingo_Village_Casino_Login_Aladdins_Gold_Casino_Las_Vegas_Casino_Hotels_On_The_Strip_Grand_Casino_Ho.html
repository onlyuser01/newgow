    <h1>Bingo Village Casino Login Aladdins Gold Casino Las Vegas Casino Hotels On The Strip Grand Casino Ho</h1>

<p>Dear RANT Casino team,</p>
<p>None of the questions in my previous post have been answered sufficiently. Therefore, I would like to repeat them.</p>
<p>"Could you please provide us with an explanation of the player's situation in more detail? Do I understand correctly that the casino confiscated the player's winnings for play that is allowed by the casino's Terms and Conditions? Or, is there anything that the casino did not disclose to the player?</p>
<p>If there was a breach of other of the casino's Terms and Conditions, is the casino able to substantiate its decision with relevant evidence?</p>
<p>Feel free to send the necessary evidence to my email address (branislav.b@casino.guru)."</p>
<p>We could recommend the player turn to the ADR, but based on the information provided by him above, we would also be able to close the complaint on our side, however, not in favour of the casino. It would be closed as unresolved, likely as "against our Fair Gambling Codex", which would negatively affect the casino's rating. So, it would be highly appreciated if you could answer my questions and provide us with more details.</p>
<p>Currently, without any further clarification/details or supporting evidence from the casino, it seems like the player was playing within the casino's rules, which the casino's system allowed, below the maximum bet amount, but his winnings have been confiscated after such play anyway.</p>
<p>It would be great if we had a detailed explanation of all that happened there.</p>
<p>Can you confirm that the emails provided above in the complainant's previous posts were sent by the casino?</p>
<p>Please note that if the player had only one casino account at RANT Casino, in his own name, and he was able to fully verify himself and pass the KYC, while he played in a way that is allowed by the casino or within its Terms and Conditions (no other rules were breached), for now, we cannot see a justified reason to confiscate the user's winnings. If the casino allows playing games with different/high volatility, counts such bets to the wagering requirements, or does not enforce its rules sufficiently by the system, it is not very fair to confiscate players' winnings for doing it.</p>
<p>If you only would not like to share the details publicly, and so to disclose the manual for bonus abuse, feel free to send me an email. Therefore, my email address was shared in this thread several times. Alternatively, just ask me to mark your post(s) as "sensitive", so they would be hidden from the public completely, and visible only to the involved parties.</p>
<p>Thank you for understanding. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
