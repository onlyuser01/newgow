<p>Dragon Tiger review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Dragon Tiger has an East Asian theme, focusing on dragons and tigers in particular.</p>
<p>Players will be transported to a world infused with Chinese flavor and inhabited by mysterious creatures. These animals will guide players on a quest for alluring treasure.</p>
<p>This slot is a good fit for fans of Asian themes and fantasy animals.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The relaxing soundtrack is filled with flute notes that give it a subtle Eastern vibe. The reels spin with a click, and wins are celebrated with festive chiming.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will immediately notice the variety of golden and jewel encrusted animals. Lucky toads, leaping koi fish, lumbering turtles, and elegant rabbits all make an appearance.</p>
<p>The most striking symbols are the white tiger and the enigmatic golden dragon. Each of these majestic beasts seems ethereal and wise as they gaze out from their reels.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are framed in gold, with a fierce dragon crawling up each side. Beyond the reels, a soft red and golden glow adds further enchantment to the aesthetic.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Dragon Tiger create a magical Eastern atmosphere.</p>
