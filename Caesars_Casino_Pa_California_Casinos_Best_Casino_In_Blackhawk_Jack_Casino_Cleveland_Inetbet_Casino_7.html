    <h1>Caesars Casino Pa California Casinos Best Casino In Blackhawk Jack Casino Cleveland Inetbet Casino 7</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I need your assistance in having this casino block my account. I've asked them kindly, through chat and email, to do it, but they insist on not doing so. They want an endless amount of personal data to deactivate my account. This site lacks user protection systems, self-exclusion, or deposit limits. I need them to delete my account. I'm lost on what to do. This is what they responded with, it's almost a mockery.</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>To block a profile, we need to confirm that it is the account owner contacting us.</p>
<p>To do this, please answer the following questions in the free field provided or next to the questions themselves:</p>
<p>-Current email address assigned to the account:</p>
<p>-Reason for blocking the profile:</p>
<p>-Your phone number:</p>
<p>-Your date of birth:</p>
<p>-Your IP Address (you can check your IP address at https://whatismyipaddress.com/):</p>
<p>-Amount of recent deposits you can specify:</p>
<p>-Amounts of last withdrawals you can specify:</p>
<p>-Payment methods for deposits and their requirements*:</p>
<p>-Payment methods for withdrawals and their requirements*:</p>
<p>These may be a phone number, wallet or card mask.</p>
<p>A card mask is the first 6 and last 4 digits of your card.</p>
<p>Also, send in the following photos in JPG format:</p>
<p>Your photo with an open passport in your hand;</p>
<p>You may hide the series and number of the passport except for two characters on both ends.</p>
<p>Passport photo near your open profile, where you can see the profile mail and phone number;</p>
<p>A statement on the card/wallet, where you can see the information of payments made to our website for one month from the last deposit.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT!</p>
<p>Send all the information in response to this letter using the "Reply" button;</p>
<p>Take clear, high-quality photos;</p>
<p>For the procedure, we need all the answers. Without them, we cannot block the account.</p>
<p>Best regards, Diana</p>
<p>7slots Gaming Club Support Team.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions,</p>
<p>You can always write us an email</p>
