<p>Welcome to our Everygame Classic Casino Review. I am here to bring you the inside scoop of what you will find at what is one of the oldest online casino sites for real money in the world. Everygame Classic Casino is a brand that was established in 1996 and remains to be a trusted and reliable source of gaming fun 27 years after the fact.</p>
<p>The website is powered by a number of excellent studios, such as Realtime Gaming, Vegas Technology, and others, bringing you some of the best real money online casino experiences. More importantly, Everygame has over 300 games to offer and features trusted and tested banking methods.</p>
<p>I have found the website to offer a sufficient variety of bonuses and games and make the deposit and withdrawal processes very easy. Let me introduce you to the rest of what Everygame Casino Classic has to offer and why it may be a good fit for you in the review below.</p>
<p>Everygame Classic Casino Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>I am going to take it from the top. Everygame Classic Casino has an ample selection of bonuses, which I find to be just what players deserve. There are several things I always focus on when reviewing a new casino, and Everygame’s bonus and promotions section is no different.</p>
<p>As a fellow player, I always want to make sure that the bonuses have fair terms and conditions. These terms are what will determine how useful the promos can be. Now, the good news is that they are definitely fair at Everygame.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you have a ton of extra free spins, generous sign-up offers, and everything is designed to give players the best possible experience with the bonus system. Here, I provide you with a better breakdown of the bonus system at Everygame and what to expect.</p>
<p>Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Alright, so the welcome bonus at Everygame is definitely a great offer. The total amount you can claim here is $5,555 which is a lot, but it gets even better – you can claim the bonus in installments. The entire amount is available across five different deposits, which I find particularly useful as there is no additional pressure to roll over the entire amount right away.</p>
<p>To activate any of the deposits, though, you need to deposit at least $20 and enter the bonus code that corresponds to the bonus you are claiming. The match rate is anything between 125% to 150% depending on the bonus you claim. For your convenience, I have summed up the bonus amounts, codes, and match amounts:</p>
<p>1 st Deposit: 125% up to $1,000 – Bonus code: SIGNUP1000</p>
<p>Deposit: 125% up to $1,000 – Bonus code: SIGNUP1000 2 nd Deposit: 150% up to $1,500 – Bonus code: MATCHUP2</p>
<p>Deposit: 150% up to $1,500 – Bonus code: MATCHUP2 3 rd Deposit: 125% up to $1,000 – Bonus code: MATCHUP3</p>
<p>Deposit: 125% up to $1,000 – Bonus code: MATCHUP3 4 th Deposit: 150% up to $2,000 – Bonus code: MATCHUP4</p>
<p>Deposit: 150% up to $2,000 – Bonus code: MATCHUP4 5th Deposit: $55 Free Bonus – Bonus code: FREEBIE5</p>
<p>The five bonuses are nicely paced, meaning that you will have plenty of time to try each one, and perhaps even roll over the full amount. Now, I find $5,555 to be a bit on the heavy side, to be honest, as this means rolling over the entire amount worth thousands of dollars. Alternatively, I try to scoop a small amount on the match bonus based on how much time I have to play.</p>
<p>But if you are a high roller, for example, you’d definitely enjoy your time with Everygame Classic Casino’s welcome bonus. The wagering requirements apply to bingo, slot, keno, scratch cards, and slots.</p>
<p>Loyalty with Everygame Classic Casino</p>
<p>Another excellent feature I found relevant and fun at Everygame Classic Casino is the loyalty program. It’s a pretty standard comp points system, but it’s definitely good that it’s there. Every time you earn up to 100 comp points, you can redeem them for actual currency, or $1 at the current rate.</p>
<p>One comp point is granted for every $10 you wager, giving you a small way to passively build up your bankroll when you try. The one drawback I actually found with this comp point system is that live casino games do not count. Now, this is not a big deal, but it might be if you are really keen on playing live casino games at Everygame.</p>
<p>Mobile Award with Everygame</p>
<p>Everygame Classic Casino features another type of bonus, simply referred to as the Mobile Award. This promotion is designed to encourage players to play through a mobile device and try the Android or iOS casino.</p>
<p>Essentially, players get a chance to win up to $100 by simply playing from their mobile devices, and also depositing a minimum of $50 and rolling it over up to $500. A total of 20 weekly Mobile Award winners will be revealed every Wednesday via email.</p>
<p>Now, the chances of you actually being among these winners are not too great, but if you are playing and spending $500 a week, you may as well do it from a handheld device, for the added bonus that you stand to gain.</p>
<p>Special and Seasonal Challenges</p>
<p>I really love how Everygame Classic Casino finds a way to keep the bonus section dynamic, fair, and generally – have a piece to offer to everyone who may be interested. Players will discover tons of extra promos to scoop as they play along.</p>
<p>There are lots of those to go around. For the most part, Everygame will run a weekly series that awards prizes to players based on a leaderboard. The amounts will vary, but they may be anything between $50 and $500 in bonus payout to winners.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed is that every time a bonus offer ends, Everygame also awards a one-time lump sum to the best-performing player not just weekly, but over the course of the entire promotion. It’s a fun little token of appreciation.</p>
<p>Everygame Classic Casino Payment Methods</p>
<p>I have always thought that good banking is perhaps half of your casino experience. Everygame Classic Casino clearly shares this vision of what a good gambling experience is all about. As a result, you can find a ton of deposit and withdrawal options that will help you always focus on the gameplay rather than being caught up in transactions.</p>
<p>The process is made simple by using popular payment methods and offering all conditions clearly and succinctly. Here is what you can expect when you seek to deposit or withdraw from Everygame Casino.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>Method Limit Time Visa, Discover, Maestro, AmEx $1,000 Instant Lightning Bitcoin $5 – $50 Instant Bitcoin $20 – $2,500 10 Minutes BitcoinCash $20 – $2,500 10 Minutes Litecoin $10 – $2,500 10 Minutes Payz $10 – $2,500 Immediately Paysafe $5 – $300 Immediately EZeeWallet $10 – $2,500 Immediately</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>Method Limit Time Bitcoin $100 – 2,500 per week &lt;48 hours Altcoins $100 – 2,500 per week &lt;48 hours Check $150 – $3,000<em> &lt;5 business days Bank Wire Transfer $150 – $2,500 per week</em><em> &lt;10-15 business days User2User Transfer Minimum $20 Immediately </em>There is a $50 fee that applies on Check cashouts, ** There is a $50 fee that applies on Bank Wire Transfer + applicable bank fees.</p>
<p>Everygame Classic Casino Games</p>
<p>Now for the best part. Everygame Classic Casino offers a ton of games to try, all of them courtesy of developers such as Realtime Gaming and WMS Technology. There is a selection of 300-odd slots, table games, and even live casino games to try, making for a very fulfilling and rewarding stay with Everygame.</p>
<p>You are free to choose the games that you enjoy best, picking from genres such as blackjack, roulette, slots, specialty, video poker, keno, and so many others. I have spent hours playing through each category to bring you a decent breakdown of what you can expect here.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Slots is the big ticket item here, with the Everygame Classic Casino featuring more than 130 different slot games to try. They are all provided by Realtime Gaming and WMS Technology, which means that you get a lot of worthwhile games with flexible betting limits and plenty to offer.</p>
<p>These games are designed to offer you a variety of great themes, feature many innovative bonus mechanics, and make the experience highly rewarding. Some of the top-performing slot titles I would recommend you try here include Dolphin King, Doctor Love, Grail Maiden, Tailgate Blitz, Goblin’s Gold, and Turkey Shoot.</p>
<p>There are actually quite a few others, but I have found the aforementioned to offer a great balance between time spent and payout. All in all, the slot selection is tight and you will never be short of a great game to try. One issue I have with the casino is that it doesn’t have a separate section for jackpots.</p>
<p>Speaking of you may be interested to also check out Fortunate Buddha, Plentiful Treasure, and Giant Fortunes.</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>Another thing that is great about Everygame Classic is the casino’s selection of table games. Titles here are definitely tailored to meet demand from players, and I am happy with that. In terms of variety, there is no shortage of table titles to try.</p>
<p>For example, you will have the opportunity to play baccarat, craps, blackjack, poker, and all sorts of roulette. The portfolio features such gems as American and European Roulette, Progressive Blackjack, Vegas Strip Blackjack, Mulligan Poker, Pai Gow Poker, and more.</p>
<p>I have definitely had fun here, tinkering with the different titles and just going through every possible option. Now, I think Everygame Classic Casino has done a great job of keeping the table games portfolio on par with their slots.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Video poker is something I am actually crazy about so when I see a casino that has done a bad job, I am very keen to point that out. Well, Everygame Classic is a casino that did a great job of supplying dozens of worthwhile video poker games.</p>
<p>I love video poker because there is so much room for skill there. The games I’ve tried – which is all of them – were all by Realtime Gaming, which is already a stamp of quality. There are plenty of games to try as well, including Jacks or Better, Aces &amp; Faces, Bonus Video Poker, Double Joker, Tens or Better, Multihand Aces &amp; Faces, and so many more.</p>
<p>The payouts are great, I thought, and generally, these games are designed to really appeal to you visually, and also give you enough leeway to exercise your knowledge and skill of video poker.</p>
<p>Specialty</p>
<p>Not least, there are a few gems of games that are listed under Specialty and will definitely be worth your time. These odd games introduce you to slightly out-of-the-box titles such as Poker Slots (which I loved) and Dazzling Dice.</p>
<p>You will also find Bingo Bucks, Poker Dice, and Keno here, all of which are based on a Random Number Generator and offer a nice change from the traditional slot experience.</p>
<p>Live Everygame Classic Casino</p>
<p>The live casino selection at Everygame Classic is not bad at all. It’s a newly-introduced functionality to the website, and it definitely adds and helps the brand build up a bit of presence.</p>
<p>Whether you are a live casino player or not, there are some excellent things to take away here. The live section brings games such as blackjack, baccarat, roulette, and Super 6, all of which are played in the company of a professional live dealer.</p>
<p>I personally love the atmosphere every time I check out the live selection and find the betting limits to be pretty flexible and definitely accessible. The games will have minimum bet requirements that start from $1 all the way up to $10 with high rollers also finding an opportunity to check out Everygame Classic Casino and enjoy it.</p>
<p>Mobile Everygame Classic Casino</p>
<p>I think mobile deserves a big mention here. Now, Everygame Classic Casino is a top-performing brand and it’s understandable that its iOS and Android casino will be on-point. Then again, I just feel that Everygame goes a step further to incentivize you to play using this option as it offers some extra bonuses along the way.</p>
<p>The platform itself is robust. I have not had any issues accessing the full functionality of the website. I have withdrawn money several times, and I had no trouble running this website on iOS, which I use for the most part. My Android device had no hiccups either, and I generally think Everygame is really at a good place when it comes to its mobile platform and functionalities.</p>
