    <h1>Holiday Inn Resort Aruba Beach Resort Casino Desert Diamond Casino Entertainment Tucson Unscramble C</h1>

<p>Thank you for understanding. Looking forward to your Power Of Attorney.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.</p>
<p>Please note that until I am provided with all the requested, I will not ask the casino for further information or details. Moreover, if you fail to provide it by the given instructions, the complaint will be closed/rejected.</p>
<p>Everything should be clear and readable in the photos.</p>
<p>We are talking about an easy process, and it should not be a problem for a regular PC user with a printer. If you do not know how to do it, please, ask someone for help.</p>
<p>Let's do it like this - Now I will repeat all the instructions again, and I will require you to provide me with the Power Of Attorney document in exactly the required form.</p>
<p>Thank you for your email and the document provided. But - are you kidding?</p>
<p>Thank you, 1xBet Team, for your email and additional details. However, before I request further information, let's wait until the player provides what we require. It looks like he did not understand my requests correctly.</p>
<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>I am sorry for the delay.</p>

<p>Find my email with the Word document that I shared with you via email, with the pre-filled details about our company</p>
<p>Edit the document in a common text editor (I recommend the Word app on a PC) - update your personal information and the casino's details in the document at the highlighted places in question</p>
<p>Print and sign the document in a classic way</p>
<p>Take a detailed photo of the printed and signed document with all corners visible in the photo</p>
<p>Take a photo of you holding your ID card stated in the Power Of Attorney</p>
<p>Take photos of the Power Of Attorney with your ID (both sides ID, 2 photos)</p>
<p>Send everything to my email - if the photos are of a better quality, split it into several emails</p>
<p>Everything should be clear and readable in the photos.</p>
<p>Please note that until I am provided with all the requested, I will not ask the casino for further information or details. Moreover, if you fail to provide it by the given instructions, the complaint will be closed/rejected.</p>
