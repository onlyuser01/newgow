    <h1>Wendover Casino Hotels Casino Los Angeles Play Chumba Casino Avi Casino And Resort Table Mountain Ca</h1>

<p>Yes I had been successfully verified all my documents had been accepted. The bonus was a 100% deposit match so I deposited $30 and they gave me $30 bonus money. messaged them straight away because I didnt want the bonus due to wagering requirements they always seem to find a way to get ya. (I have successfully had bonuses taken off on other casinos they just took the bonus amount off and I carried on playing without my wager and only my cash balance) they refused to do so, I then asked them what my maximum bet was whilst I’m on the wager and he told me with my $30 my maximum bet was $6 so I made sure I never went any higher than this ampunt. Unfortunately because I never thought this was going to happen I never got screenshots of this particular conversation. But when i Started getting a bit iffy due to the length of time they were taking to do anything I started screen shotting the conversations and emails I have had with them.</p>
<p>WAGERING REQUIREMENT WAS WELL AND TRUELY MET BUY THIS STAGE.</p>
<p>I first withdrew $1800 from memory and the verification was taking aged so I played it down to about $5 and suddenly I staarted winning again and got it up to about $7800 but withdrew it at $5800. i recieved an email stating all my verification was approved I was just waiting for the withdrawal to be approved by the audit team.</p>
<p>KYC Approval.</p>
<p>I also asked them via chat who they were licensed through And the told me they were unable to disclose this information and that’s when I started really looking into it Gav’s use they can’t not tell me who they are licensed through. That’s when I found you guys and found out exactly what I hoped wasn’t true.</p>
<p>I can’t upload any more photos in this comment but I have my full history screen shotted and saved as a PDF file on my iPad.</p>
