<p>Winning any game brings a thrill, but winning a jackpot is something else. This is exactly what one lucky Videoslots player experienced recently.</p>
<p>Videoslots Player Wins £1,1M Jackpot</p>
<p>The award-winning online casino has announced that one of its players won a staggering £1,140,134.37 ($1,310,920.80) jackpot by playing IGT MegaJackpots. The lucky player will now have a million reasons to better their present after winning this life-changing jackpot. But that’s not the only recent jackpot dropped from IGT Mega Jackpots. Since the launch of MegaJackpots Cleopatra and MegaJackpots Siberian Storm in 2015, IGT MegaJackpots have brought many life-changing jackpots for lucky players.</p>
<p>Henrik Enesund, Videoslots’ Head of Casino, reveals that the latest jackpot comes on the heels of a Dream Drop Mega Jackpot win that dates back to June this year. Now, he added that the recent win with IGT marks a thrilling moment for Videoslots. In conclusion, Enesund pointed out that the company is delighted to see the player collect the hefty win and spend it with joy.</p>
<p>“After the Dream Drop Mega Jackpot win we had earlier in June with Relax Gaming, we are absolutely thrilled that we now have another winner with IGT. We can’t wait to see how this impacts the continued uptake of our games that feature these thrilling features.“ Henrik Enesund, head of casino at Videoslots</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow and Entertain Customers</p>
<p>Customers of Videoslots have enjoyed significant winnings with different jackpots. After only six weeks had passed since the release of Relax Gaming’s Snake Arena Dream Drop, a lucky player hit a staggering €997,779.17 ($987,791.40) prize.</p>
<p>Only recently, Videoslots announced a deal with Stakelogic. Earlier this week, the duo joined forces for the regulated gambling market in Italy. On that topic, Enesund said: “As our name suggests, we absolutely love slot games and in Stakelogic we have a developer that knows exactly how to create titles that put players on the edge of their seats with each spin.” Thanks to this deal, Videoslots customers in Italy can now enjoy Stakelogic’s video and classic slots for the first time. Besides expanding Videoslots’ offering, the deal also brought new engaging content for customers in the country.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Videoslots is currently a leading operator within the growing online gambling industry. Setting the bar high, the operator joined forces with more than 170 leading iGaming developers and by now it offers more than 6,000 games. Focused on growing, the company leverages its industry experience and seeks to deliver new engaging games that bring big prizes for its customers.</p>
