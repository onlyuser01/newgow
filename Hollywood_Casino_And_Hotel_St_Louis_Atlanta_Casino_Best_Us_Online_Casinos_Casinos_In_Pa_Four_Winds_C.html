    <h1>Hollywood Casino And Hotel St Louis Atlanta Casino Best Us Online Casinos Casinos In Pa Four Winds C</h1>

<p>Thank you for your reply, Anto1318. I understand your point of view, but as I said, casinos can accept players from restricted countries as long as they don't use it as an excuse to confiscate their winnings. Of course, the best way to avoid this is to block such players automatically. However, some casinos cannot enforce it on a software level, and in such cases, the correct approach would be to pay the player's winnings and close their account.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you created your account and lost your deposits by your own choice, we don't think you are entitled to a refund. You could lose your money/deposits the same way in any other casino. I am sure that if you won more money than you deposited, you would want your winnings to be paid out, and not deposit refunded, am I right? I am sorry but have to approach each similar case equally - if the player from a restricted country lost their deposit, they are not entitled to a refund, and if such player accumulated winnings, the casino should pay them out and close their account.</p>
<p>We share more information regarding this topic in our Fair Gambling Codex.</p>
<p>In this case, I can only recommend that you do more thorough research before creating an account and only play in casinos that accept players from your country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information we are rejecting this complaint as unjustified. Sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino and we will try our best to help.</p>
