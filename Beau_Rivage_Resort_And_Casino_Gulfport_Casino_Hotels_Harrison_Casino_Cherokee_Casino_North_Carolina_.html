    <h1>Beau Rivage Resort And Casino Gulfport Casino Hotels Harrison Casino Cherokee Casino North Carolina</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We hope this message finds you well!</p>
<p>Considering the timeline of events in this particular case we have decided to refund the initial deposit, which is also comparable to the requested withdrawal amount.</p>
<p>We would also like to clarify the issues in this case. To address the timeline, the withdrawal was requested after the 100% First Deposit Cashback was claimed. The initial request was declined because some additional verification was required. Until the second withdrawal review, the player claimed several free bonuses, thus triggering the enforcement of the Bonus Abuse rule, since they did not have any other deposit on the account outside of the first one, and exceeded the ratio stated in our Terms.</p>
<p>In regards to the limitation of bonuses, we do have technical solutions in place in order to avoid such situations, however there are always ways to circumvent those solutions, in which case the failsafe stands in the Terms and Conditions. We send out free bonuses via email, and there are alternative opportunities for other bonuses as well, but all of the bonuses are on-claim, meaning we do not proactively add bonuses to any account without consent. We are aware that most players are not able to log in daily to claim the rewards and are limited by their availability during certain periods of time, so we offer several opportunities for the players to claim different bonuses at different moments. However, this does not detract from the fact that they adhered to a certain set of Terms and Conditions, and while we do try to prevent most forms of abuse via technical means, the onus is on the player to ensure they remain within the bounds of the terms they agreed to when signing up.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the beginning of the reply, due to the circumstances of this particular case, we have already sent the funds to the player, however the account will remain closed.</p>
<p>Should you require any additional help or information, please do not hesitate to contact us, we are available 24/7.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Tangiers Casino</p>
