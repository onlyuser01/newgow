<p>Developer of online games, systems and technology Scientific Games (SG) announced today it launched its OpenGaming platform in Colombia via a partnership with Betsson Group.</p>
<p>‘Premium Experience to Players’</p>
<p>The debut for the OpenGaming ecosystem in the Latin American country was made possible after Betsson, an online gaming operator with significant undertakings in the region, acquired 70% of Colombian sports betting and online gaming brand Colbet in July 2020.</p>
<p>“It is important for us to offer a premium experience to players in Colombia and by launching with one of the industry’s pre-eminent content aggregation platforms, we are able to do exactly that.” Ciara Nic Liam, Director, Gaming, Betsson Group</p>
<p>Scientific Games and Betsson Group initially partnered a few months later, in September 2020, when the online sports betting and iGaming company gained access to the OpenTrade proprietary sports betting solution operated by SG’s Nevada-based subsidiary Don Best Sports Corporation.</p>
<p>“With the addition of Scientific Games’ in-house content and titles produced by leading studios in the initial roll-out phase, we can continue to present our customers with an ever-growing content catalogue with widespread appeal.” Ciara Nic Liam, Director, Gaming, Betsson Group</p>
<p>Latin American Journey Begins</p>
<p>Customers at one of the first licensed operators in Colombia, Colbet, will initially have the opportunity to enjoy the thrill of playing games developed in-house by SG’s studios, including recently acquired Sydney-based Lightning Box, as well as content supplied by third-party providers Big Time Gaming and Reel Play, while the full portfolio of the aggregation platform will be made available in the near future.</p>
<p>“Betsson Group has big plans across both Colombia and the LatAm region and we are sure that our offering will appeal to its players across a wide demographic.” Dylan Slaney, SVP Gaming, Digital, Scientific Games</p>
<p>Betsson’s brand will also receive access to some complementary features offered by the OpenGaming platform, as well as a host of responsible gaming tools, which will help the brand become more attractive to Colombian players.</p>
<p>“This partnership represents the first step for OpenGaming in a vibrant market. Our sights are firmly set on building sustainable success across LatAm, one of the most important growth areas in the world for the iGaming industry.” Dylan Slaney, SVP Gaming, Digital, Scientific Games</p>
<p>Regulated in 2016, Colombia is one of the countries of the Latin American region the gaming industry considers to hold huge growth potential, and the debut of the OpenGaming platform marks just the start of the journey for Scientific Games in the online casino space in this part of the world.</p>
