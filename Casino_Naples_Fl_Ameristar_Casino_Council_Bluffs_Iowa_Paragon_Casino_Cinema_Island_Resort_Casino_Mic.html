    <h1>Casino Naples Fl Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs Iowa Paragon Casino Cinema Island Resort Casino Mic</h1>

<p>The rebranding comes at a time when the company continues to grow within the business-to-business (B2B) vertical and anticipates further expansion of its brands</p>
<p>The leading online gambling company based in Gibraltar, BetVictor, released details regarding a new group corporate identity. On Wednesday, the company released details regarding its new identity, including a new company logo, name, as well as corporate website. As a result, BetVictor confirmed that it will now be known officially as BVGroup. Additionally, the company unveiled the domain of its new website, www.bv-group.com.</p>
<p>Andreas Meinrad, BVGroup’s CEO, spoke about the recent rebranding and explained that the company has a rich history spanning more than seven decades. He pointed out that BetVictor has grown exponentially over that time and by now it holds a leadership position within the global gambling vertical.</p>
<p>Meinrad pointed out that the company’s new corporate identity helps underline the success it has achieved so far. Finally, BVGroup’s CEO pointed out: “While we remain intensely proud of our heritage, our focus is always on the future and how we can continue to innovate and grow to best serve our customers and partners. BVGroup is an exciting development in the progress of the company.”</p>
<p>“During our 75+ years in business, we have established ourselves as one of the most reputable gambling companies in the world. Our new identity, BVGroup, helps us define ourselves more effectively, highlighting how far the company has come from its bookmaker beginnings.“ Andreas Meinrad, CEO of BVGroup</p>
<p>The Company Remains Focused On Growing Its Brands</p>
<p>As noted by Meinrad, BetVictor is a company that has a rich history within the gambling world. Its origin dates back 75 years ago as a trackside bookmaker but it is now recognized globally as the largest independent gambling and technology provider in the world.</p>
<p>In line with its plans for future growth, the company confirmed that it will continue to service and manage its flagship BetVictor brand, as well as its new Wiz Slots brand. What’s more, BVGroup will also continue to grow the brands talkSPORT BET, Heart Bingo, BildBet, as well as Parimatch UK.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Advertising and Standards Authority (ASA), the advertising regulator in the UK, announced it upheld an assessment against BetVictor. Announced back in mid-April, the Assessment against BV Gaming, trading as BetVictor in the UK, reiterated that gambling ads must not appeal to children.</p>
