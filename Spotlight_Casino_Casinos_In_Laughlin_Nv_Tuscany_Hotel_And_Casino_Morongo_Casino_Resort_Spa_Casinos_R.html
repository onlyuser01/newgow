<p>Stakelogic and Stakelogic Live, the iGaming and live dealer divisions of the same company, have teamed up for the early release of the first instance of the Super Wheel bonus feature as a Unibet exclusive ahead of the new product's global launch that is set for November 9.</p>
<p>The new solution is designed to combine the excitement of both slot and live dealer gameplay and it will be incorporated with existing slot games.</p>
<p>Essentially, Super Wheel is a live casino bonus feature that allows players to enjoy their regular slot gameplay but also gives them a chance to enter a "Wheel of Fortune" round that can be triggered at some of Stakelogic’s most popular slot games, including Candyways Bonanza 3 Megaways, Multiplayer4Player, and many other titles by the company.</p>
<p>This is an optional feature that is triggered completely at random and it can only serve to add to the fun and excitement that players get. The bonus feature is activated based on a Random Number Generator that is built into each of Stakelogic's titles.</p>
<p>Once you enter the live dealer bonus feature, you will be welcomed by a charismatic host or hostess who will lead you through the action. Larding even more excitement on top, the Super Wheel bonus feature will come with three additional bonus games on its own, namely Vegas Hold n Spin, Vegas Diamonds, Vegas Drops, and more. Each of these levels will make it so that players stand to benefit even more.</p>
<p>Stakelogic CEO Stephan van den Oetelaar welcomed the addition of Super Wheel to the company’s signature library and hailed the combination of both live casino and slot action to create a truly outstanding product.</p>
<p>He noted that live casino is a fast-expanding vertical in the iGaming industry, and that the slot catalogue developed by Stakelogic now had a chance to tap into that momentum and provide truly outstanding options to player bases.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live Product Manager Dimitrios Merkouris was similarly excited about the introduction of the new product, with Super Wheel described as a "game changer." The product introduces a level of freshness that is brand new to the online casino sector.</p>
<p>"Our team has poured boundless creativity and expertise into crafting a feature that encapsulates the essence of thrilling gameplay, offering players an immersive experience like never before," he concluded.</p>
<p>This new feature comes only a few days after Stakelogic and Unibet launched another exclusive game, the slot title Super8Wild.</p>
