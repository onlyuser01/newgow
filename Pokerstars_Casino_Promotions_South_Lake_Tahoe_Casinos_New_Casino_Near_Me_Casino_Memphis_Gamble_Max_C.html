<p>William Hill, a UK-based online gambling company, has expanded its footprint in Europe by launching new sports betting in Latvia.</p>
<p>William Hill Forays into Latvia</p>
<p>The operator will gain entry to the country thanks to its previous deal with the local operator 11.lv. William Hill acquired the Latvian company in 2019 and will now use it to launch its own content in the country. Additionally, the British operator will use media partnerships to jumpstart its new operations in Latvia. Its aim is to boost its brand awareness and appeal to Latvian punters.</p>
<p>William Hill’s launch in Latvia comes ahead of several elite sporting events. These include the 2022 International Ice Hockey Federation Ice Hockey World Championship and the Responsible Gaming Latvian Cup national club soccer competition – a tournament sponsored by William Hill.</p>
<p>The operator’s expansion comes as the company’s ownership group, Caesars, prepares to sell William Hill’s non-US assets to 888. The $2.4 billion deal is set to close in June this year and follows an agreement by Caesars and 888 made in September 2021.</p>
<p>The Company Is Excited to Conquer a New Market</p>
<p>Nir Hakarmeli, the International managing director of William Hill, spoke about the launch in Latvia. He praised 11.lv for influence in Latvia and lauded it as one of the best-positioned gambling brands in the country. Hakarmeli added that this will be of tremendous help to William Hill as it forays into the Latvian market.</p>
<p>This makes us well-positioned to take this strategic step, and we look forward to introducing one of the strongest brands in the industry and proving to our Latvian customers that William Hill is who you play with. Nir Hakarmeli, international managing director, William Hill</p>
<p>11.lv was licensed in Latvia in 2012 and has a decade of experience in the market. The company provides its customers with both sports betting and casino offerings.</p>
<p>William Hill Had Regulatory Hurdles</p>
<p>William Hill recently got under fire by Britain’s Gambling Commission. It accused the operator of being incompliant with the regulations and even threatened to revoke its license. Because of this, Caesars and 888 had to introduce changes to the agreement that will see William Hill change ownership. As a result, Caesars agreed to indemnify any damages that may come from the suspension of William Hill or any of its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>888, the company that will acquire William Hill, has also had compliance problems before. In March, the UKGC handed a $12.6 million fine to the operator for failing to prevent money laundering and not being socially responsible.</p>
