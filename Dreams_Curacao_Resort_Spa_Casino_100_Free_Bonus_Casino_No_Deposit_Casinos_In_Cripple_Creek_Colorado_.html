    <h1>Dreams Curacao Resort Spa Casino 100 Free Bonus Casino No Deposit Casinos In Cripple Creek Colorado</h1>

<p>I didn't even know that my 2FA codes are stored on my email address.</p>
<p>That would be new to me.</p>
<p>And again an excuse presented here by Stake to avoid liability.</p>
<p>My 2FA codes run on a stand alone phone with nothing else installed.</p>
<p>So back to the question. What does the mail have to do with the codes that change every 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Really nothing...</p>
<p>As already mentioned above, Stake is the only store where I was hacked, because if someone really had access to my data, everything would be gone and not just Stake's €8300.</p>
<p>So either Stake took the money itself when there wasn't a security breach, or Stake just covers up the security breach.</p>
<p>So Stake already told me the reason for the account closure?!</p>
<p>So I'm going to ask Stake to provide evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>It wasn't mentioned here in the forum. And in the chat I was dumped with the following answers:</p>
<p>... that it is permanently locked and it cannot be undone.</p>
<p>I was also informed that I had commissioned it myself.</p>
<p>When asked when I reported this, I got the same answer as above that it's permanently blocked and it can't be undone.</p>
<p>In addition, I ask myself why the account was reopened at all after the reported theft of around €8300? Because I sent the insults to your general manager back then, after he told me that I would never see the money again and that he was not aware of any guilt. But it was probably even more important to grab all my personal data, pocket another 1000€ from me and then make off with it.</p>
<p>And on the subject of gambling addiction:</p>
<p>Oh, so you wanted to protect me? Before what please? So I don't win even more? In case you forgot, I am currently about 4574.01€ plus (about 12874.01€ if you count the stolen money)</p>
<p>So where does the gambling addiction come from here?</p>
<p>I would be interested to know how many players are really automatically banned from Stake due to gambling addiction? Probably nobody, because those are losses that Stake would then make.</p>
<p>So please stop taking everyone for a fool.</p>
<p>As Casino-Guru will now surely find out, Stake's statements do not agree here.</p>
