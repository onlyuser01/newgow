    <h1>Spokane Tribe Casino Empirecity Casino Wildhorse Hotel And Casino Luckyland Casino Map Of Casinos In</h1>

<p>While playing dice on my computer, i set a condition to stop autobet if my balance is lower than or equal to $87.8 or 1ltc. However, the autoplayer kept playing even after my account balance dropped lower than the condition i had set. Before i got angry, I was curious as to why the game did that. I have attached photos of the situation.</p>
<p>I contacted stake live support chat and the woman who was supposed to help me was utterly useless and aggravating. She would disappear for long periods of time, constantly stating that the game is fine and that there is nothing wrong with it. Essentially, i felt she was calling me a liar. I have attached the conversation.</p>
<p>frustrated at her, i just decided to email the support team myself. I emailed them the situation and was met by a response from "SlobodanJ" who also told me that the game is functioning correctly and asked me to provide a video. I told him that i didnt record my session and rather than SlobodanJ, i was responded to by a "Marko" who asked me some questions that would help in the problem solving. I provided him the info to the best of my ability and he told me that after they investigate, that they would contact me.</p>
<p>I was fine with that.</p>
<p>The next day however, i deposited money into my account and decided to play dice on my cellphone with the same conditions as the day before, autobet to stop if account balance dropped below or equal to $478.26. I could not believe that the SAME situation happened AGAIN. I was so angry that I immediately contacted Marko telling him what had happened.</p>
<p>I have attached the email thread of both day 1 and day 2 as well as the conditions that i set.</p>
<p>I hadnt received any response all day. So i'm writing this complaint.</p>
<p>The fact that I was told that the game is working fine means that they should have been testing the situation in question, right? Not just the game itself. Also, Why do i need to record my games? Is it necessary in order to protect myself from possible unethical practices? They should be able to see everything on their end right (I have no idea, im just assuming that's how it is)?</p>
<p>There is no way that they are able to tell me that the game is working fine, and that they had tested it.</p>
