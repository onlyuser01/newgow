    <h1>Rising Sun Casino Z Casino Planet 7 Casino 100 Free Chip Casino In Tulsa Ok Delaware Casino Casino R</h1>

<p>Hi there, yesterday I got an email from them saying they have now verified my account with the new verification picture I sent them and opened my account again.</p>
<p>So I made another $700 withdrawal via Bitcoin 24 hours ago.</p>
<p>I just went into live chat to ask them how is my withdrawal going. They said it has been approved and sent on their end and it's waiting on my bank for approval.</p>
<p>His the funny thing it's Bitcoin so there is no bank involved which means if it was approved and sent from there and it would have reached my Bitcoin wallet already.</p>
<p>Say during a live chat I mention this, as I know they're obviously lying about having paid the money and are putting it off again for some reason, and as soon as I stated that I instantly got cut off of live chat same come back in 24hrs.</p>
<p>It's obviously a lie about having sent the payment because why would I come back in 24 hours if my Bitcoin would have reached my wallet within an hour, here's a copy of the chat:</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>22:24</p>
<p>Kindly be advised my mistake but it is awaiting approval and has been processed on our end please note it can take some time to be procesed contact us in 24 hourd sgsin</p>
