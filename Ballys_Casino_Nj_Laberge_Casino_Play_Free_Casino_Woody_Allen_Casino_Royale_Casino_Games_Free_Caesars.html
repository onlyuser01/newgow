<p>Caesars Entertainment has just announced that Caesars Sportsbook is now available in Ohio ahead of the launch of legalized sports betting set for January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook Goes Live Ahead of Official Sports Betting Launch in Ohio</p>
<p>The Caesars Sportsbook mobile application and desktop version are now available for download in Ohio. The official launch date of sports betting in the state is still more than two months away, but Caesars Sportsbook is already live, offering Ohio customers an attractive bonus for early registration.</p>
<p>If an Ohio resident opens an account with the Caesars Sportsbook and deposits funds before the market launch date of January 23, 2023, they are in for a betting bonus of $100.</p>
<p>In connection with the app going live, Eric Hession, President of Caesars Digital, has highlighted the rich sports tradition in Ohio, which Caesars Sportsbook hopes to become part of: “Ohio’s rich tradition of sports excellence speaks for itself. Caesars Sportsbook is ready to match the pedigree and passion of Ohio sports fans with a sports wagering experience that treats them like royalty.“</p>
<p>All Caesars Sportsbook clients can of course reap the benefits of Caesars Entertainment’s loyalty program called Caesars Rewards.</p>
<p>When placing bets on the mobile app or desktop version players can earn Tier Credits and Reward Credits. Bettors can use those for various experiences offered by Caesars Rewards.</p>
<p>The credits also provide discounts for special getaways at different Caesars Entertainment venues across the United States. Bettors can also use the Caesars Rewards points to get betting cash directly to their account to continue wagering on their favorite sports.</p>
<p>Other great perks that bettors can enjoy with Caesars Sportsbook stem from Caesars’ partnership with Cleveland Cavaliers. Caesars Sportsbook players will have exclusive access to tickets, Cleveland Cavalier’s merch, and in-person experiences such as meet-and-greet events with the athletes.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook a Natural Expansion of Caesars’ Legacy in the Buckeye State</p>
<p>Eldorado Gaming Scioto Downs in Columbus is one of Caesars Entertainment’s top locations in Ohio with a long-standing racino tradition.</p>
<p>In connection with the launch of sports betting in the state, the notorious racino is going to open its very own high-end retail sportsbook. The new addition to the racino will start offering in-person sports wagering on the official market launch day on January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>As a result of Caesars’ partnership with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Cleveland residents will be able to enjoy a retail sportsbook at the team’s home venue – the sports and entertainment facility Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. The new sportsbook will be located in the area at the Northwest Atrium.</p>
