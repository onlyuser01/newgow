    <h1>Delaware Park And Casino Casinos Kansas City Mo Wv Casinos Cimarron Casino Perkins Ok Indian Casino</h1>

<p>I deposited 39.65 via Skrill to Das Ist Casino.</p>
<p>Tried my luck with lightning roulette and won a nice 4400 euro. After that I initiated a withdrawal and went to bed. In the morning I got an email that the document showing the deposit from skrill to the casino didn't match. Which isn't true. They keep telling me that I send the wrong document. My Skrill email is different than the one I use for the casino.</p>
<p>On my Skrill account you see the exact date and time which matches that on the casino.</p>
<p>The first live agent was a guy named Victor who was a bit annoying and not trying to understand. Kept saying things like unfortunately we can't accept the document which is a literal screenshot of the deposit.</p>
<p>I became a bit angry and left the chat.</p>
<p>After this conversation I took a shower and came back and spoke with a Live agent named Daniel, I send him the exact same document and he verified my account.</p>
<p>After that I got an email stating:</p>
<p>"We are glad to inform that your account is fully verified now at DasistCasino.</p>
<p>Thank you for assisting us."</p>
<p>Good day, dear Diangelo!</p>
<p>"I congratulate you on your recent winnings!!üëçüëçüëç I'm happy to see such a player by DasIstCasino! Your game experience is a good example of how a good player should gamble. Wow, I admire you!</p>
<p>To be able to withdraw you just need to verify your account and provide some documents which our Support Team emailed you about. We are sorry for bothering you with the verification, but unfortunately, we have to do this according to Malta Gambling Authority requirements. Luckily, it should be done once only!</p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to receive a personal reward for your activity in the future, please just let me know.</p>
<p>I wish you a lovely day and good luck with your further playing of course!</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>David</p>
<p>Your VIP Manager @ DasIstCasino"</p>
<p>Daniel told me I could proceed for a withdrawal. I did exactly that, I was happy..the nightmare was over right?</p>
<p>Nothing is more true.</p>
<p>After a while I get an email saying I need to verify again because my document i send Daniel wasn't "valid"</p>
<p>This time I speak with a girl named Eva, Eva accuses me that I'm sending the wrong documents..where I ask her that I'm already verified.</p>
<p>She says her system tells her I did the deposit with a different account which again is not true! I tell her that this all is shady and she doesn't respond for a long time only reading it. After a while I threatened her with the gaming commission and complaints on websites.</p>
<p>After a while she nonchalantly says</p>
<p>" can I help you with anything else"</p>
<p>I ask her to talk to David the manager, she tells me no David isn't here. I tell her that's a bad lie. She abruptly ends the chat saying " we reached an end to our conversation "</p>
<p>Is this what a responsible and reputable casino is? I've played with many casinos winning big. Betsson,Boomcasino,Casinowinner etc and never had a problem verifying. Always quick payouts without stalling and lying to me. It's really sad as this is an German casino and thought the service would be great too. Until I saw this website..</p>
<p>I initially signed up through Askgamblers so how come a casino as this is rated so good on Askgamblers?</p>
