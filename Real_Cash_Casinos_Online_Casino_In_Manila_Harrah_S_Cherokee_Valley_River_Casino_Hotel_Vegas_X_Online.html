<p>Swintt’s Expansion Is ON as It Teams up with Ellmount Gaming</p>
<p>Swintt, a Malta-based innovative iGaming company, has teamed up with Ellmount Gaming, to offer its suite of popular entertaining games.</p>
<p>Ellmount Gaming to Offer Swintt’s Thrilling Titles</p>
<p>Swintt, an innovative fast-growing, iGaming developer, has partnered up with Ellmount Gaming, an online casino operator, to roll out its entertaining content. Under the agreement, Ellmount Gaming will offer Swintt proprietary games and hit land-based slots. The operator has successfully partnered up with other popular casino brands. Its players will soon have access to Swintt’s immersive content, including upcoming titles like Vikings of Valhalla and Five Princesses, and Lone Rider.</p>
<p>With its development and design of high-quality casino content and growth-oriented approach in localized markets, Swintt quickly gained popularity in the industry.</p>
<p>Swintt with a License in Sweden Soon</p>
<p>Swintt Chief Commercial Officer David Mann said that the provider’s portfolio is extensive and localized. Its games are designed to meet the specific needs of players for each market. The developer’s games combine state-of-the-art design with smart math to provide an engaging experience.</p>
<p>With licenses in Malta and Sweden, Ellmount Gaming complements Swintt’s market expansion goals. The iGaming developer expects to have a certification in Sweden later this year.</p>
<p>Mann stated that this is another milestone for Swintt. He said that offering the provider’s engaging titles to the Ellmount Gaming portfolio is ultimately seeing their players gaining access to Swintt’s games and at the same time aligning the company’s goals for growth with new operators on various markets.</p>
<p>Swintt Expands Across Multiple Markets</p>
<p>Recently, Swintt teamed up with LeoVegas Group, a Swedish iGaming company offering mobile gaming. Swintt rolled out its portfolio entertaining titles to the provider’s operated brands.</p>
<p>Last month the company partnered with White Hat Gaming, market-leading casino solutions distributor, to offer Swintt’s portfolio of games to various European markets. Under the deal, White Hat Gaming will help Swintt distribute its signature content to reach different audiences.</p>
<p>Ellmount Gaming’s chief product officer, Stefania Mincu said that the operator’s brands have a reputation of giving players quality online casino games. Created by the best developers in the industry, Swintt’s content is the best addition to their portfolio.</p>
<p>She said it is a natural move. Swintt’s land-based slots are a hit, and she believes that they will quickly become popular among their players. Mincu also stated that Ellmount looks forward to adding the provider’s proprietary games as they are exactly what their players are looking for.</p>
