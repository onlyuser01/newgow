    <h1>Lawton Casino Online Casino Free Play No Deposit Casinos In Wisconsin With Hotels San Manuel Casino</h1>

<p>All of a sudden, after I make a deposit, Pronto announces that my account is blocked and that documents must be submitted. Refuses to pay my balance. Not interested in submitting documents, do not want to spend time on this. Useless chat with some puck that only repeats itself and of course refers to conditions. The support is of course very sorry that they have to do this - not their choice but the licensor who requires this. Bullshit of course.</p>
<p>The next time I went to the live chat, they would have blocked me from it. My money was still confiscated.</p>
<p>That this site recommends Pronto as a good casino site means that you do not know what you are doing. How much does Pronto pay you for your false reviews?</p>
