<p>Dear Isaac,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.bcasino.com/en/promotions/welcome-package#tnc:</p>
<p>"The following wagering activities are not allowed until the wagering requirements of this bonus have been completed:</p>
<p>The use of bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages of games.</p>
<p>Equal, zero or low margin betting</p>
<p>Betting on a non-slots game, such as a table or card game</p>
<p>Betting more than € 4 per spin or 10% of the received bonus amount (the smaller of the two) on a slot game</p>
<p>Betting on non-allowed games (Please see "Non-Allowed Games" for list of non-allowed games).</p>
<p>Using a ‘feature buy’ or Buy Pass function within a game.</p>
<p>If, on review of your wagering activities, it is found that you have performed one of the above, your winnings will be removed."</p>
<p>If you are aware of placing bets on restricted games while wagering your bonus, sadly, there is not much I can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing bets on restricted games, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet. You were not stopped or blocked when you decided to switch games, and, as a result, you breached promotional terms.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else, I could do for you in this matter, otherwise I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
