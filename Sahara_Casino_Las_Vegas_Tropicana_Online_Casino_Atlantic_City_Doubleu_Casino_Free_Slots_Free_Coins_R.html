    <h1>Sahara Casino Las Vegas Tropicana Online Casino Atlantic City Doubleu Casino Free Slots Free Coins R</h1>

<p>This place is the absolute worst. They are the epitome of the word scumbags. I was given a "free chip" (nothing is free with these clowns) for $10.00, with a playthrough of 35Ã—. So I proceeded to play, and low and behold.....I actually exceeded the playthrough. So I then went to withdrawl my $100.00 limit of winnings. I was then told by one of their sub-par, joke of a customer service reps. "That I had to make a deposit to withdrawl and to verify my acct." Now mind you I've deposited with these clowns in the past. But since my last deposit, there had been too large of span without a deposit. So an additional 25.00 was required. (Funny how they don't need to verify when you are depositing, all is well then.) So I get an email saying my withdrawal was reversed. So I go login to this $hitshow and boom no $100.00 dollars. So I then speak to one of the "stellar" customer service reps named Nicole. She again informs me that my withdrawal has been canceled, and funds were voided. I ask where my money was that I had won (my requested $100.00 and the $200.00 plus that magically disappeared after requesting a withdrawal.) Nicole must be really busy today folks because I'm still waiting on her to get back to me!!ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ¤”. So in the end this place is a complete joke!! In the rest of the civilized world (and where people have morals) this is called robbery! I know I know....it was a free chip, as I said earlier "nothing is free" with these clowns. The ammount of $ i have spent there, i should get several "free" chips.If some1 doesn't say anything, they will continue to scam people. I'm only one person, imagine all the others who fell for it too! Let that sink in......oh and I couldn't email or copy my chat thread with Nicole!</p>
