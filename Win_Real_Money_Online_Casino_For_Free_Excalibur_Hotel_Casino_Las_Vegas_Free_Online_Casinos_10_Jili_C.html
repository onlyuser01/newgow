<p>US mobile-first online sportsbook ClutchBet announced it has launched a new product, ClutchClash, exclusively for its players in Iowa.</p>
<p>H2H Player Matchup Parlays</p>
<p>The launch of the world-first ClutchClash product in Iowa allows bettors to utilize player matchups across the NFL and NBA by making the ultimate head-to-head player parlays, using player prop markets in any eligible game of both professional leagues.</p>
<p>Commenting on the company’s new product, senior vice president of Marketing at ClutchBet Sean Phinney hailed the launch as “yet another example of ClutchBet’s commitment to product innovation and providing Iowans with a world-class wagering experience.”</p>
<p>The launch of the ClutchClash product enables NFL bettors to create a parlay around self-curated H2H player matchups even when the two chosen for the parlay players are not competing against each other in the same game that particular week.</p>
<p>As for the NBA, ClutchClash player matchup parlays are available in the same game only but H2H matchups between two players on the same team can be made and added to a same-game parlay.</p>
<p>“ClutchBet players in Iowa now have a world-exclusive sports betting product to enjoy, along with unique and locally-focused promotions and offers,” Phinney concluded.</p>
<p>Debuting in the US</p>
<p>Owned by ASX-listed BlueBet, ClutchBet launched its first operation in the US in Iowa in partnership with the Q Casino and the Dubuque Racing Association in August having received sports betting license from the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission (IRGC).</p>
<p>BlueBet and the Dubuque Racing Association signed a five-year market access deal in July last year and the agreement has provisions for BlueBet to extend it for another five years. Following the launch at Q Casino, the sports bar at the casino property rebranded to ClutchBet Lounge.</p>
<p>ClutchBet is now featuring ClutchBet Lounges at three other locations in Iowa besides at Q Casino: Gary Dolphin Iron Bars in Dubuque, The Leaderboard Sports Bar in North Liberty and Vine Tavern and Eatery in Iowa City.</p>
<p>To celebrate its first launch in the US, ClutchBet is enticing new players with several special offers, including a risk-free bet of up to $500, pay out of winning point spread bets on Iowa and Iowa State at odds of +150 all season, as well as access to a section of the site, ClutchPicks, that offers daily boosted game odds across different sports.</p>
<p>In September, the sports betting brand signed a multi-state deal with Paysafe to utilize the payments processor’s suite of digital payment solutions Paysafecash and its Skrill USA digital wallet and ensure seamless payments for Iowans, and later on to other US markets where the sportsbook becomes operational.</p>
