<p>International sports betting and gambling giant Entain has praised its new Advanced Responsibility &amp; Care (ARC) program as the most effective problem gambling monitoring system. According to statistics, the program has helped many of Entain’s customers get their problem gambling under control.</p>
<p>Entain Praises Its ARC Program</p>
<p>In its release, the operator said that as a leader in sports betting and gaming, Entain must remain committed to ensuring best-in-class customer safety and protection. Entain believes that the ARC program, which leverages robust tech solutions, is an undisputed leader when it comes to fighting problem gambling.</p>
<p>Entain’s program is based on three core principles: responsibility, technology and prevention. As a result, ARC is more than a solution that merely identifies problem gambling. The program is all about good interaction that prevents harm before it has occurred.</p>
<p>ARC, which has been launched in 22 markets, leverages a Protector Model that has already had over a million interactions with Entain’s customers. The company’s Customer Protection Contact Center is constantly working to increase touchpoints with customers at different risk levels and encourage them to use account tools and moderate their game time. The most serious cases in the UK are directly transferred to GamCare.</p>
<p>The Operator Posted Statistics about the Program’s Efficiency</p>
<p>Entain also posted statistics about the efficiency of the ARC program. According to the results, 90% of Entain’s high-risk customers are aware of the gaming controls and are actively using them. The same applies to almost half of the medium-risk users (48%).</p>
<p>Data also shows that an astonishing 41% of medium and high-risk gamblers have moved to low or no-risk levels following an intervention. 95% of contacted users remain active, which helps Entain remain sustainable.</p>
<p>Finally, Entain remarked that about 80% of its customers are setting the gambling control recommended by ARC.</p>
<p>Jette Nygaard-Andersen, Entain’s chief executive officer, said that she is very proud of the results. She noted that Entain is doing all of this because “it is the right thing to do” and shows the company’s care for its customers, communities and colleagues. Furthermore, Nygaard-Andersen noted that the ARC program is the best way for Entain to achieve the long-term sustainability and success it desires.</p>
<p>Being a socially responsible company is not just important for us, it is at the heart of our purpose. Jette Nygaard-Andersen</p>
<p>The CEO concluded that ARC continues to be “a game changer” in enhancing player safety, while Entain’s other programs continue to promote diversity and grassroots sports.</p>
