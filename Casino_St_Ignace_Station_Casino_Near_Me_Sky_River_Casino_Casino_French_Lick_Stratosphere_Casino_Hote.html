<p>Aspire Global’s iGaming and Sportsbook platform provider brand BtoBet has signed a new agreement with the gambling company FanDuel.</p>
<p>BtoBet to Provide FanDuel with Player Account Management</p>
<p>The deal will see BtoBet provide FanDuel with a new Player Account Management platform that will boost the operator’s daily fantasy sports offerings in Brazil.</p>
<p>FanDuel is delighted by the opportunity to extend its partnership with BtoBet. The former company’s new markets director, Aaron Champagne, spoke on the deal and revealed that he is excited to see the Player Account Management implemented to FanDuel’s Daily Fantasy Sports platform in Brazil.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working closely with BtoBet, and through our shared commitment to offer a unique DFS experience to local players,” Champagne said.</p>
<p>Amy Howe, the chief executive officer of FanDuel, recently shared that FanDuel is bullish on providing Brazilian players with the best possible quality of daily fantasy sports.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s intentions of establishing a strong foothold on the Brazilian market are further attested by the company’s actions. A few days ago, FanDuel teamed up with Grupo Globo to provide the latter’s Carola FC brand with daily fantasy sports. Additionally, the two parties are collectively working to develop a new platform for daily fantasy sports named Cartola Express.</p>
<p>BtoBet Continues to Be a Reliable Source of Tech Solutions</p>
<p>For Tsachi Maimon, the chief executive officer of Aspire Global, BtoBet’s ownership company, this new deal is a significant step towards the two parties’ common goal of establishing strong positions in the United States and Brazil.</p>
<p>For Aspire Global, in particular, the success in those markets is crucial for the realization of its dream of becoming one of the leading global business-to-business iGaming suppliers.</p>
<p>The BtoBet brand boasts more than 20 years of experience within the field of informational technologies, software development, telecommunications, banking and e-commerce. BtoBet is dedicated to ensuring cutting-edge tech solutions to its partners.</p>
<p>BtoBet is a longtime partner of Flutter, FanDuel’s ownership company, with the former playing a part of the latter’s expansion in Latin America. BtoBet’s prime moment came after the regulation of the Colombian betting market in 2016. Since then, BtoBet has become the leading sportsbook supplier around.</p>
<p>Thanks to the reputation of BtoBet, Flutter’s other brand Betfair, used the B2B company’s solutions when joining the Colombian market in October 2020.</p>
<p>In more recent news, in August, BtoBet appointed long-time industry specialist Guy Gani to be its new chief technology officer. Gani’s strategic acquisition aims to further strengthen the company’s strong portfolio of B2B offerings and various solutions.</p>
