    <h1>Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino Osceola Iowa Casino Atlantis Casino Resort Spa Reno Captain Jack Cas</h1>

<p>A while ago I opened an account in a casino and since I was just losing money I self-excluded myself from playing in the casino due to a gambling problem. After a week or two, I get a message from the VIP department that I have a bonus and that I should reconsider self-exclusion.</p>
<p>Then I wanted to play again and received a 50 euro bonus. I fell into addiction again and lost money, self-excluded. A week later, I wanted to try my luck again, and the account opening was refused. I accepted. A week later, I got a message again that the self-exclusion was lifted and that I could play. I deposited 192 euros and lost it. Then my account was closed again due to the ban. I requested my deposits back on 16. september 2023,which I was told they would do.</p>
<p>To this day, they use the excuse that the application is in progress and that I should wait a bit. I don't know what to do, the casino is very suspicious to me, I have the feeling that they just want to collect money and don't care about the players. Asking Askgamblers for advice. Even self-exclusion does not work here, they invite you to join</p>
<p>re-opening and reward with a bonus, plus they promise better chances of winning. I am attaching pictures as proof.</p>
