<p>The survey states that every second client of SOFTSWISS has worked with the company for more than 3 years</p>
<p>A deep industry survey reveals that transparent cooperation, simple and quick communication, top service level, and a variety of game providers are the most significant criteria for selecting an iGaming provider in 2022. The said business research was conducted by Kantar Ukraine, a leading marketing research company, on behalf of SOFTSWISS for the period between July and October 2022.</p>
<p>The software development company wanted to obtain detailed knowledge and information about the iGaming sector and to be aware of the most important criteria when selecting a casino platform provider. SOFTSWISS also aimed to gain information on how satisfied the clients are with the SOFTSWISS Casino Platform in comparison with other competitive platforms.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Winning iGaming Operator</p>
<p>Per the survey, in 2022 the most crucial characteristics of an iGaming provider partner include transparent cooperation, support in income generation activities, and services and products that satisfy the needs of your company.</p>
<p>In this study, 93% of the respondents answered that the “provider should be a financial partner,” which is an increase in the significance of this criterion compared to 63% in 2021. The other criteria, which include “Prompt resolution of tech issues and response” and “Flexibility when discussing the terms of cooperation” gathered the same percentage as in 2021.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS clients listed “Provides top service level” and “Simple and quick communication with managers” as the most important features when it comes to personal touch aspects, which influence the decision-making process.</p>
<p>“Attentive attitude to each client“ was another criterion, which gained higher priority compared to the last year’s results.</p>
<p>The survey states that every second client of SOFTSWISS has worked with the company for more than 3 years, which describes it as a long-term partner with experience in the gambling industry and profound knowledge about the market.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Top Casino Platform</p>
<p>The survey was also focused on the top-priority characteristics for selecting an online casino platform, which included a variety of game providers, player reporting, and flexibility of bonus settings, among others. The respondents listed “Payment systems management” and “Supported currencies” also as important features as they did in 2021. However, this year financial reporting and licensing criteria are pointed out as more important due to the higher number of regulated markets.</p>
<p>Satisfaction with the SOFTSWISS Casino Platform</p>
<p>According to the research, 86% of the respondents answered that they were satisfied with the SOFTSWISS Casino Platform giving it between 7 and 10 points, and only 14% of the clients gave below 7 points. The total score of the platform was 7.6 points out of 10, which is a bit higher than last year’s result.</p>
<p>Darya Avtukhovich, head of SOFTSWISS Casino Platform, commented that until now, the staff behind the SOFTSWISS Casino Platform has launched nearly 400 successful projects, making this product “the biggest and most meaningful” offer in SOFTSWISS portfolio.</p>
<p>Per the clients, SOFTSWISS has outperformed its rivals with regard to the service support level and communication with business account managers.</p>
