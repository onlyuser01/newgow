    <h1>Juegos De Casino Gratis Agua Caliente Resort Casino Las Vegas Casinos Map Hotel Casino Monte Carlo L</h1>

<p>On April 6 , 2022 i put in my request for withdrawal after hitting the jackpot on Cash Splash for $28, 513.53. But , on the one isolated time, I deposited via etransfer from my girlfriends bank after i sent her the deposit amount. I honestly didnt even think of it as i have done this before at other casinos and all they asked for was the 3rd parties ID and letter confirming i had their permission. Thats it.</p>
<p>SO after verification and every other hurdle was passed, i was then told my account was being reviewed because of this third party deposit. I have many deposits prior to this time and lots after.</p>
<p>Since April 6, ive heard from them twice. Once to tell me that email comuunication was no longer available to me, and another time they sent me an approval for a credit card that wasnt even listed in my account.</p>
<p>They did it to get me thinking i was approved for withdrawl, just to find out it was a notice meant for someone else.</p>
<p>They then allowed me to reverse over $6000 back into my account. After it sat in casino vault and was moved to the 2nd stage of the withdrawl process.</p>
<p>I submitted every document , ID , bank statements and even extra docs that werent ewven asked for, proving myself and my details and hers.</p>
<p>So for the past 3 weeks my $16,500 (but in my account it reads $21,000) my winnings have sat there and i havent heard back from managment in any regard. Then this past friday, after i just ifnished depositting close to a $100 more, my account was closed. For something i said out of context , whcih i explained to chat support, but as soon as we were done they threw me under the bus and closed my account while i still had my withdrawl pending.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how much i played over a 3 day period can be explained by this...At Lucky Nugget they have 'Loyalty Points' or status points a player can accumulate based on how much they bet and spend insoide the casino. When i began playing on sunday night, my account status was the lowest one. Green i believe. In less than 3 days I had climbed to the very top of the status ladder. Cashing in over 500,000 loyalty points, also reversing over $6000 back into my account.</p>
<p>Anyway i was pretty pumped as I could really use this right now and with everyday that passed since it has become a nightmare as i knew this group would everything they could to delay, withhold and ignore me to make this process so uncomfortable that it would end up not getting paid put at all. I can prove it as well. 3 years ago, less than 1 month afte I lost my son, this same group made me hand write them letters basically proclaiming them right and me wrong because i had accidenty created a duplicate account, both were funded, and just to get access back took me 5.5 months. The torrment and ridicule and antagonistical methods only this group loves to unleash. I am a student and faithfully played at his site only to be poked and prodded in an attempt to invoke me into saying something in chat that would disqualify me.</p>
<p>Ther are many policies of their own they broke. As a meet in the middle resolution, I suggested I would only withdraw $10,000. Losing more than half for my poor choice in depositing, ONCE, and their acknowledgement of the torment and unnnessesary delays and inadequate player support becuase they are NOTHING about support to me or any other player.</p>
<p>Anyway sorry its kinda long but i felt it was important to know all the facts.</p>
<p>(I also have video recoerdings of every single chat convo i had during this situation, as my requests for a transcript of each convo never happened&gt; I had to basically call PSC over the phone ans ask for the transcripts. When I did get them, only half of them were there)</p>
