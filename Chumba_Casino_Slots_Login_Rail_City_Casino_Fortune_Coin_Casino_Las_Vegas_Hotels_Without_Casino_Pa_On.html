<p>Riot Games is all for fan-driven initiatives except when they involve gambling. The topic of gambling has not been entirely a tabu for game developers, and League of Legends and Valorant, both Riot Games’ titles, are some of the most wagered-on games out there.</p>
<p>Staking out Players in TFT Turns out a Bad Idea</p>
<p>But a new type of high-roller buy-in for a Teamfight Tactics tournament was politely stopped in its tracks by the company, which decided that alluding to gambling-like mechanics was at the time inappropriate, although not necessarily condemning or criticizing the initiative as the company has placed a great value on self-starters within the community.</p>
<p>TFT content creator “YippeeMaokaiYay” decided to work with Stakekings.com and host a $10,000 prize pool tournament, bringing together eight well-established players. Each player was invited to place $1,250, which was accepted by participants who saw it as a form of poker.</p>
<p>Stakekings.com wanted to put a twist on the experience with the company offering players to actually back their players by helping pay the buy-in. This is not unlike how some poker players have a person who “stakes them” and they then share some of the winnings with said person.</p>
<p>This is precisely what the idea behind staking out TFT players was. However, Riot Games objected to this and argued that buy-in tournaments could indeed be a part of a future model, acknowledging the idea and its merit, but said that it would not come in any collaboration with a gambling website or fans and players being asked to stake out players.</p>
<p>The idea behind the staking model is interesting. It effectively gives viewers shares in a player’s performance. But then, they claim winnings based on that share. How this is calculated would depend on services such as Stakekings.com. Regardless, Riot Games has described the tournament pitch as a direct breach of its T&amp;C’s when it comes to third parties hosting tournaments.</p>
<p>Riot Clarifies on Objection and Confirms Commitment to Players</p>
<p>Michael Sherman from Riot Games decided to step in further, after explaining the company’s motivation in not allowing this tournament’s staking model to kick off.</p>
<p>Some top TFT players recently announced a high buy-in tournament where the community could stake their buy-in. We’re excited to see the passion, but we’ve asked them to remove the ability for the community to stake their buy-in as this is not something we allow at this time. Michael Sherman from Riot Games</p>
<p>He further added that Riot Games was already in touch with the organization and attempting to ensure that all consumers receive a refund as the tournament would not happen. Sherman explained that the stance is consistent with Legends of Runeterra as a whole. While this may look like a blip, it’s a clear sign that Riot Games would continue to support community-driven content and initiatives that do not invite hidden dangers.</p>
