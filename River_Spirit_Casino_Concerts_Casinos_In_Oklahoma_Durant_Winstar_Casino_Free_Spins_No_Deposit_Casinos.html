According to popular belief and lots of Irish folklore tales, after each rain, there is a mysterious rainbow popping in the sky. Fortunate rainbow lovers who manage to find the end of the rainbow have a good chance to come across a mouth-watering pot of gold belonging to a rich leprechaun.

<p>As expected, the slot features simple and engaging gameplay with colorful graphic elements on the 3 x 3 grid with five lines. The background is represented by a nicely-designed green forest backdrop with a gorgeous rainbow seen across it and what appears to be magical golden fairy dust and falling leaves from the trees.</p>
<p>The background is supported by a handful of representative symbols part of the Irish folklore mixed with the leprechaun theme, with leprechauns wearing their iconic green hats, four-leaf clovers, horseshoes, green leprechaun shoes, pots filled with gold coins, and rainbow symbols shown all across the grid.</p>
<p>When compared to other games that belong to the same popular genre, our experts have concluded that Leprechaun Frenzy looks spectacular. It instantly promotes a feel-good experience and gameplay specific to cheerful slots where characters primarily need to go looking for riches in a positive environment.</p>
<p>Leprechaun Frenzy: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>To win, players must match three identical symbols anywhere on the grid and look at the paytable to find out the win they are eligible for. For example, matching three pots of gold rewards players with 100x the stake. Coming across three lucky horseshoes symbols triggers a 50x payout, while three green Leprechaun hats filled with coins bring players a payout of 15x.</p>
<p>Three four-leaf clover symbols reward players with a 5x payout while three green leprechaun shoes get a 3x payout. Finally, coming across three rainbow symbols get players the smallest 1x payout. On the opposite end, the highest-paying symbol in the game is represented by the Leprechaun. Players who match a minimum of three such symbols are rewarded with a 500x payout. Players who manage to hit multiple three-of-a-kind symbols will have their winnings added together.</p>
<p>A maximum number of three identical symbols can be seen showing up on the card simultaneously. Players can also win on the same card with groups of one, two, or three different symbols. Winnings for groups of three symbols are added together, resulting in the total win. The winnings are determined by the value of the multiplier x the amount of the total bet. The game has a 95% expected payback in the long term.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The cheerful soundtrack that accompanies the gameplay nicely completes the overall aesthetics and graphics. However, players who would like to concentrate more on the gameplay and don’t make any distractions interrupting their focus are given the option to mute the game’s soundtrack or the sound effects heard when the reels start to spin and new symbols are revealed. The game’s animations are also excellent, with continuously falling leaves and fairy dust from the trees in the background.</p>
