    <h1>Treasure Island Casino Concerts Best Real Money Online Casinos Casinos Online Real Money Westgate Re</h1>

<p>I had requested a withdrawal of my account after it was closed. There was $2800 to be wire transfer to myself. I gave them all the information necessary to do the wire transfer. They did send a wire transfer on July 28th, but because information was missing the transfer was sent back on August 6th. I sent Monster Casino the email from the bank stating this and proof that the deposit wasn't made. August the 15th was the last time they communicated with me saying they will look into it. I've called several times (no answer) and sent several emails but no response in over a week. They got me thinking they are a fraudulent casino because of their unprofessional behaviour of not returning phone calls or emails. Also, what kind of casino can't do a simple wire transfer properly. It was a simple mistake that could easily could have been fixed. It's been about a month and I still don't have my money.</p>
