<p>The world-leading technology, media and content company, Spotlight Sports Group (SSG), announced it renewed its partnership with the leading bookmaker Paddy Power. On Monday, the company confirmed that besides renewing its deal with Paddy Power, it expanded the collaboration as well. As a result, the leading bookmaker will once again be the title sponsor of Racing Post's live and daily festival preview show called the "Good Morning Racing" series.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, Paddy Power will be the sponsor for 15 morning shows. Moreover, the bookmaker will sponsor every day of the much-anticipated racing events such as the Grand National festival, the Cheltenham Festival, as well as Royal Ascot.</p>
<p>In a statement released on March 13, 2023, a spokesperson for Paddy Power said: "We’d like to think we bring to Good Morning Racing what Piers Morgan brought to Good Morning Britain, informative insights with unexpected outbursts."</p>
<p>Last but not least, the spokesperson pointed out: "We’re looking forward to saddling up for another wild ride with the team this year. Our £150k Finders Keepers giveaway will cost less than the breakfast tab."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, Paddy Power confirmed a special giveaway of up to £150,000 ($180,300) in cash. The unique event is a part of the bookmaker's "Finders Keepers" campaign and sees a drop of £5,000 ($6,000) on a random basis into active players' accounts. Once this occurs, the online players will have up to 15 minutes to claim that prize. If they don't claim the prize within that time, they are still left with a partial sum which will be £500 ($600).</p>
<p>Sam Houlding, SSG's chief commercial officer, was excited about the recently announced collaboration. He said: "Our daily and live Good Morning Racing shows are an essential part of our digital coverage surrounding racing festivals and this partnership extension with Paddy Power will help take the shows to the next level."</p>
<p>Houlding added that the collaboration helps connect Paddy Power's growing audience with the experts from the Racing Post. Finally, he said: "Combining our Racing Post experts and following with that of Paddy Power will provide a wide-ranging audience with the insight they need to be well-informed bettors on every race day."</p>
<p>Recently, SSG announced a senior-level appointment by selecting Mark Renshaw as CEO. Announced late last year, the appointment sought to strengthen the company and help it continue to grow.</p>
