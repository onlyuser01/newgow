    <h1>Menominee Casino Caf Hollywood At Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Menu Ocean Casino In Atlantic City</h1>

<p>Official data, technology, and broadcast partner at the nexus of sports, betting and media Genius Sports announced today a partnership with the European Tour that will see the launch of the new official Fantasy game of the DP World Tour.</p>
<p>Enhance Fans Experience</p>
<p>The launch of the new free-to-play (F2P) Fantasy game in partnership with Genius Sports will provide the Tour with a valuable gamification tool to boost fan engagement throughout the entire season by enhancing the fan experience.</p>
<p>Guy Kinnings, deputy chief executive officer and chief commercial officer of the European Tour outlined that the popularity of previous Fantasy games among fans of the Tour was the main motivator for the organization to look “at new ways to further enhance the fan experience.”</p>
<p>“Genius Sports was a natural partner for the launch of a new DP World Tour edition, given their well-established reputation developing Fantasy games for some of the world’s biggest sports rights holders. We’re delighted to have the game live ahead of what is shaping up to be an exciting week of golf.” Guy Kinnings, Deputy CEO and CCO, the European Tour</p>
<p>Customized by Genius Sports, the new Fantasy game will involve a prediction of six leading players for each event week of the season and is looking to attract avid fans of golf and new audiences, while the new Selection Cap feature will require knowledge about every golf player in every tournament, testing the players’ knowledge and limiting the times they can select every individual golfer.</p>
<p>Bespoke Solution to Attract Golf Fans</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Judd Goldstein, Head of Sales, Fan Engagement at Genius Sports, stressed the importance of partnerships in building “completely customized tools” to engage with sports fans within an “increasingly competitive sports landscape.”</p>
<p>“This partnership combines our expertise in both free-to-play games and data-driven marketing, providing the European Tour group with a bespoke solution to engage and attract golf fans right around the world.” Judd Goldstein, Head of Sales, Fan Engagement, Genius Sports</p>
<p>Utilizing Genius Sports’ data-driven marketing technology which combines highly targeted programmatic marketing combined with customized and dynamic creativity, the Fantasy game will attract fans of golf, offering them to create their own leagues and pit their knowledge against close friends and family members while competing for unique prizes.</p>
<p>The agreement with the European Tour is the latest F2P game-oriented partnership for Genius Sports that affirms the company’s position as a preferred partner of sports organizations. It is following in the footsteps of the agreement with the National Lacrosse League for the launch of the NLL Pick ’Em Challenge in December last year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Genius Sports signed its first Latin American tracking and video augmentation deal with Liga MX outfit Club Necaxa to introduce its Second Spectrum technology to the region.</p>
