<p>Scientific Games will continue to tackle gambling addiction as one of its main business pivots, with the company taking aim at the increased levels of gambling around Christmas time. The company’s lottery division is joining the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) for the latter’s “Gift Responsibly” campaign that will take place during the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>Scientific Games will work in collaboration with the NCPG and North American lotteries as well as some counterparts in Europe and Australia to ensure that consumers are aware of the risks of excessive gambling. Holiday spending on gambling products has long been a pain point for many industry observers who have noted increased activity across operators, including lotteries.</p>
<p>Bringing Holiday Spending on Gambling in Check</p>
<p>NCPG executive director Keith Whyte has welcomed Scientific Games’ decision to participate in the program and commended the company for its leadership in the lottery industry. SG is also one of the companies to be certified by the World Lottery Association, recognizing it as a responsible gambling partner, and added:</p>
<p>“They are a valued NCPG member that is once again participating in the Gift Responsibly campaign. We thank Scientific Games for helping to spread the message that adults should avoid giving lottery tickets to children during the December holiday season.” NCPG executive director Keith Whyte</p>
<p>Scientific Games will help boost awareness for the NCPG initiative by integrating it with its own “Healthy Play” program, which is designed to help lottery operators promote safer gambling messages and avoid incentivizing vulnerable consumers, or at the very least, provide them with the means to stay safe.</p>
<p>Two Initiatives That Drive Home the Message</p>
<p>SG Lottery vice president of responsible gambling, Carla Schaefer, has said that the company’s creative and marketing teams have been working hard to create a campaign under the Healthy Play banner that promotes responsible gambling. Moving forward, those messages will also feature Gift Responsibly images and assets.</p>
<p>Both programs are perfectly aligned, Schaefer added. The two entities will collaborate to get their message across social media and other communication channels to help bolster awareness for the upcoming holiday season and the associated increase in gambling that usually takes place.</p>
