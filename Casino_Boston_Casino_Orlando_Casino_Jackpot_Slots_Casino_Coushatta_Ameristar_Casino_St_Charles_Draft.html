<p>DraftKings and Meadowlark Media signed a new partnership agreement on Tuesday this week. Under the partnership, both DraftKings and Meadowlark will distribute The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz and The Le Batard &amp; Friends Network across multiple media channels.</p>
<p>DraftKings Inks First-of-Its-Kind Deal with Meadowlark Media</p>
<p>The daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting operator, DraftKings, announced on Tuesday that it inked an agreement with Meadowlark Media. The first-of-its-kind deal involves content distribution, monetization, and sponsorship. Under the new agreement, Meadowlark Media and DraftKings will distribute The Le Batard &amp; Friends Network as well as The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz across a range of TV, audio, and social media channels. Furthermore, the network of shows is also going to feature DraftKings’ odds, as well as a general sportsbook and daily fantasy information, and betting trends.</p>
<p>The latest deal complements DraftKings’ continuous expansion, following the acquisition of Vegas Sports and Information Network (VSiN). Furthermore, the operator revealed that it plans to develop and launch new content projects together with Meadowlark. Brian Angiolet, who was recently appointed as chief media officer of DraftKings, will oversee and optimize the content creation and media strategy involving both VSiN and Meadowlark to maximize efficiency and reach.</p>
<p>Dan Le Batard Shares His Excitement about the Recent Deal</p>
<p>In a statement, Dan Le Batard thanked DraftKings for empowering the show and giving it a media boost combined with total freedom. Furthermore, he deemed DraftKings as a “fearless creative partner” that sees the future and wants to change it. Le Batard stressed that the company believed in the show and gave it more freedom than any other media company would. Furthermore, he assured the show’s fans that the partnership and funding will not change it or corrupt it in any way.</p>
<p>“Thank you, DraftKings, for empowering us with the exhilarating combination of rocket fuel and total freedom.” Dan Le Batard</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in January, the Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz left ESPN radio. Consequently, the show ranked within the top sports programs on Apple podcasts. Now, following the latest agreement, the show will continue to be available as a podcast, and there will be new formats of the show launching this year.</p>
<p>Meadowlark Is Thrilled to Collaborate With DraftKings</p>
<p>John Skipper, Meadowlark CEO, said that the company is thrilled to collaborate with DraftKings. Furthermore, he acknowledged that the two companies share a vision to grow the already widely popular network of shows with the help of non-conventional ways. Last but not least, Skipper said that with the freedom to distribute these programs, Meadowlark will undoubtedly reach a bigger audience, while at the same time providing incredible DraftKings content.</p>
<p>“John Skipper and Dan Le Batard have established a deep roster of content creators that will continue to expand quality and original programming.” Jason Robins, CEO, co-founder, and chairman, DraftKings</p>
