<p>Kyle Christensen, a former Facebook and Netflix executive, is set to help Australian sportsbook PointsBet increase its market share across US gaming jurisdictions as the firm’s US chief marketing officer.</p>
<p>‘Upping Our Game’</p>
<p>PointsBet announced the appointment of social media specialist Kyle Christensen as its US chief marketing officer today. He will support the sportsbook’s marketing efforts and further engage with sports fans and players across regulated gaming jurisdictions in the US in which the Australian-based sports betting firm has active operations.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new addition to the company’s ranks, PointsBet CEO Johnny Aitken noted that the operator continued to “hire the best talent in the world,” following a pre-determined growth trajectory. He added, “As our business evolves and in-game betting continues to be an ever more important aspect of the premium experience we offer, upping our game and reaching our customers where they are is critical. I couldn’t be more excited to welcome Kyle to our team and can’t wait to see what we build together.”</p>
<p>With nearly 20 years of marketing industry experience and serving as the head of brand and consumer marketing at Facebook in the US since February 2020, Christensen is bringing a lot of marketing expertise to the sports betting operator.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Christensen could not hide his content at the “amazing time to be joining the PointsBet team,” as the sports betting industry is experiencing exponential growth and constant innovation, reminding him of “the early days of the ‘streaming wars.'”</p>
<p>PointsBet’s unique offering, a premium experience delivered to discerning customers, is a story I’m looking forward to sharing. Thrilled to be on a team of professionals ready and willing to challenge conventional wisdom, shake up the status quo, and elevate the sports betting industry. It truly is a marketer’s dream.” Kyle Christensen, Chief Marketing Officer, PointsBet US</p>
<p>Prior to joining the social media giant, Christensen served at National Geographic TV as vice president of marketing, as well as global creative manager for Netflix. During his stint at Netflix, he was instrumental in the launch of the nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series, in 2016, for Narcos.</p>
<p>Other High-Profile Appointments</p>
<p>The addition of Christensen is the latest in a series of concerted marketing efforts at the company, which also saw the appointment of Jeff Gamble as vice president of Creative, as well as Dave Rivers, joining PointsBet’s Canadian subsidiary as vice president of marketing.</p>
<p>Looking to engage with sports fans, PointsBet appointed as brand ambassadors prominent athletes like NFL legend Drew Brees and the NBA’s Allen Iverson and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>
<p>In the social media space, PointsBet announced earlier this year Paige Spiranac, an influential media personality in the world of golf with over 3.7 million followers, as its brand’s global lead on-air. Later in the year, the firm appointed Notah Begay III as its golf ambassador to emphasize the importance of engaging with golf fans.</p>
