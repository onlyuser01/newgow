<p>The move comes as part of a planned transition, with John Levy departing in mid-February and Benjie, Aubrey, and Noah Levy leaving their positions in April 2024</p>
<p>In a strategic leadership transition, the founding family behind theScore will step down from their roles at PENN Interactive, a subsidiary of PENN Entertainment, Inc. The operator retains its focus on consolidating its offerings following the successful launches of ESPN Bet and theScore Bet and should be well-positioned to pursue further growth in 2024.</p>
<p>The Levys Were Instrumental in Penn’s Success</p>
<p>TheLevy family, consisting of John Levy, Benjie Levy, Aubrey Levy, and Noah Levy, played pivotal roles in integrating theScore with PENN Interactive after the gambling giant acquired Score Media and Gaming Inc. in October 2021. The integration involved bringing together theScore and PENN Interactive under the leadership of Benjie Levy as head of interactive and John Levy as executive chairman of theScore.</p>
<p>Parent company PENN Entertainment expressed gratitude for the Levy family’s contribution to its successful integrated media and betting strategy. CEO and president of PENN Entertainment Jay Snowden emphasized the Levys’ entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering role in the sports media and gaming industry, highlighting their shared passion for innovation.</p>
<p>I am very proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish with (the Levys), including the development of an extremely deep and talented bench at PENN Interactive. Jay Snowden, PENN Entertainment CEO and president</p>
<p>Penn Entertainment is now actively searching for a replacement for Benjie Levy, the company’s head of interactive. The new hire will have large shoes to fill, as Levy was instrumental in several significant milestones for Penn Interactive. His efforts contributed to the successful sale of Barstool Sports back to David Portnoy and the $1 billion ESPN deal.</p>
<p>Their Departure Heralds a New Era for the Operator</p>
<p>John Levy will depart Penn in mid-February, while the rest of the family will leave in April 2024. This approach ensures a smooth management shift and should help avoid significant disruptions. The Levys have not yet disclosed any plans post-departure, but it is safe to guess that they will remain involved with the industry that brought them such significant success.</p>
<p>Benjie Levy noted he was happy with the Penn partnership, thanking the team for their support. He highlighted the successful merger of the two organizations, allowing them to implement their integrated media and betting strategy. He added that the two companies had a shared vision, matched only by their efforts to foster a world-class working environment.</p>
<p>We could not be more proud of this team and what we have accomplished together, and we look forward to watching as they continue to build upon the successful foundation we established at theScore. Benjie Levy, head of PENN Interactive and president and chief operating officer of theScore</p>
<p>The departure of the Levy family from their roles at PENN Interactive marks a significant transition point for the company. With its robust and experienced team, PENN Entertainment aims for a seamless leadership transition and continued growth as a leader in online gaming and sports media. The company hopes to fully leverage its resources and maintain its impressive momentum going into 2024.</p>
