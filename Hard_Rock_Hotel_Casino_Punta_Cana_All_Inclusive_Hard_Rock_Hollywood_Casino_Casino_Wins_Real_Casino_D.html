<p>Altenar, one of the leaders in the development and deployment of solutions for the iGaming and sports betting verticals, has expanded its reach in the Latin American market further through a collaboration with MiCasino, a prominent local brand with strong roots in the region, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>As a result of this collaboration, Altenar will provide MiCasino with the former’s dedicated sportsbook product – a first for both companies working together in this particular vertical. MiCasino has operations in both Chile and Peru, and Altenar’s sportsbook platform will first be rolled out there.</p>
<p>However, the companies have plans to expand beyond these two markets and keep on adding more markets across the region. Brazil is a possible target for both as the country is expected to be one of the world’s largest sports gambling markets.</p>
<p>MiCasino’s strong local presence is definitely a plus for both partners, but this partnership is further strengthened by Altenar’s own experience with running platforms locally. Apart from its state-of-the-art betting software, the company has been actively developing products that are tailored to meet local player expectations across the board.</p>
<p>Altenar also brings a whole lot of variety with it, covering virtual sports, lottery and quinellas, which are a specific products popular with local sports fans. MiCasino will further leverage Altenar’s platform and product solutions to create personalized products that make lasting impressions and boost engagement through the use of loyalty incentives and more.</p>
<p>MiCasino’s representative was excited to see the partnership take shape. He praised Altenar as one of the best companies in what they do. "Our players will absolutely love what Altenar showcases in terms of its sports offering and we feel that this is the start of a long and prosperous partnership together," the representative assured.</p>
<p>Altenar Commercial Account Manager Stathis Souflas confirmed that his company was similarly excited to be teaming up with the local casino operator and help power its sports betting solution. He assured us that Altenar had a strong reputation as one of the most secure and trustworthy sportsbook solutions suppliers in the region.</p>
<p>"Further expanding across key LatAm markets with MiCasino will no doubt further cement our leading position in LatAm, and we look forward to announcing plenty more deals in the near future," Souflas added.</p>
<p>Altenar has in the meantime been expanding elsewhere, with the company launching with ChillyBets in Germany, and obtaining certification in the Netherlands. Last year, Altenar also rolled out in Ontario, Canada, having obtained a license by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).</p>
