    <h1>Mgm Casinos In Vegas Cash App Casino Free Casino Games No Download Modo Us Casino Online Casino Bonu</h1>

<p>Despite the vicissitudes of the Italian iGaming market, there seem to be no stopping operators that are determined to continue delivering on new releases and experiences for consumers. Complete radio silence on gambling advertising may have dissuaded many, but Italy’s potential as a gambling destination still prompts companies, Stakelogic included, to explore fresh opportunities in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The latest is a partnership between Stakelogic, a provider of leading iGaming content, and one of the leading gaming companies in the country, Betsson Group. Stakelogic is delivering its bespoke content of unique iGaming products to StarCasinò, owned by Betsson.</p>
<p>Access to Stakelogic’s Unique Games and Features</p>
<p>As a result, players will be able to access a number of outstanding titles, including Extreme Megaways, Hero Clash, Book of Adventure, Super Stake Edition, Black Gold 2 Megaways, and Mystery Drop, to name a few, making for a great variety of products readily available to consumers. Betsson Group gaming manager at StarCasinò Marco Strazzulla commented on this tie-up:</p>
<p>“Stakelogic’s classic and video slots are among the best in the business and are proven when it comes to delivering exciting and thrilling experiences to players.” StarCasinò Marco Strazzulla</p>
<p>Strazzulla added that by featuring more cutting-edge games, the brand was proving that it values its customers and seeks to expand the available gaming experience for them. StarCasinò, Strazzulla commented, remains a leader in the Italian market.</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s continuous efforts in developing ground-breaking iGaming content has resulted in the development of prominent products, such as Super Stake and Mega Super Stake, two exquisite mechanics pioneered and brought to market by the company.</p>
<p>Mutually Beneficial Agreement</p>
<p>Through these mechanics, players stand a chance to double their bets and have a chance to access even bigger winning combinations. As one of the leading brands in Italy, StarCasinò will benefit from the same mechanics and features. Commenting on this release, Stakelogic CCO Olga Bajela said:</p>
<p>“Italy is a significant market for us, and we are delighted to have increased our presence in the region through this deal with Betsson and its StarCasinò brand, which is one of the most popular in the country.” Stakelogic CCO Olga Bajela</p>
<p>Bajela was confident in the potential of Stakelogic games that are designed with the player in mind. She argued that the company is able to deliver on products like no others in the market, quickly making them a player-favorite choice. Bajela cited those games’ successful track records in other European markets, which should serve as the basis of their popularity in Italy as well. She added:</p>
<p>“Then you have our modern video slots that come packed with bonuses and features and keep players on the edge of their seat with every spin. We look forward to seeing Star Casino’s players enjoy the thrills and excitement each of our slots has to offer.”</p>
<p>Stakelogic has been in the news of late. The company’s newly launched live content arm is looking to hit a milestone of as many as 100 live game presenters before long.</p>
