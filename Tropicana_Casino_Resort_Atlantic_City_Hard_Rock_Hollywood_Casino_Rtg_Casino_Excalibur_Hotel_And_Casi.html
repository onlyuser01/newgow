<p>Finlandia Casino, the leading gaming operator in Finland, is going to make a play for other regulated markets besides its own stomping ground. The company is rebranding to Winlandia so that it may expand into more markets across Europe and strike home with bigger audiences across the continent, bringing more than a decade of experience running a business in one of the strictest online gambling environments.</p>
<p>Winlandia brings a hefty portfolio of slots, live dealer titles, table games, and numerous payment options, bonuses, and promotions among others. The operator is expanding in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and beyond that in the United Kingdom, bringing its products to a wider audience and more markets.</p>
<p>The brand is also tailoring its offer in such a way as to transcend national boundaries and create an experience that is going to appeal to a diverse range of players. There are more than 5,500 games available at Winlandia, with new games added at a rapid clip to bring even more variety and innovation to the platform.</p>
<p>Commenting on this move, Head of Acquisitions &amp; PR at Winlandia Christoffer Grönlund has welcomed the opportunity to grow the brand and introduce its fresh identity with player bases in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the United Kingdom as the first phase of expansion.</p>
<p>The second phase will involve growing in other markets, including Canada and New Zealand which have already been earmarked by the team.</p>
<p>"We believe the only way to truly stand out is to excel across all areas and let data lead the way, from brand to bonuses, games to payments and of course customer service. Localization, personalization, and conversion rate optimization are also a must for each market, Grönlund added optimistic about what is to come next."</p>
<p>He spoke highly of the extensive experience that the operator had and said that this would be put to good use in cultivating loyal player bases in new markets. Incredibly exciting plans are coming, the company’s representative said, with many interesting experiences locked in and ready to be delivered to players in due time.</p>
<p>The decision to move forward with global expansion comes at a time when Finland has decided to liberalize its market and dissolve its monopoly, giving local operators a strong incentive to export their expertise and experience in delivering outstanding games to other well-established and tightly regulated markets.</p>
