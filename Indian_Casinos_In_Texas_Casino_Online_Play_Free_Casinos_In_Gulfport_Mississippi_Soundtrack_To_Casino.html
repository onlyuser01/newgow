    <h1>Indian Casinos In Texas Casino Online Play Free Casinos In Gulfport Mississippi Soundtrack To Casino</h1>

<p>Hello Petronela,</p>
<p>Many thanks for the quick processing. Up to date at my complaint was simply rejected, I may myself but first contact the casino connected to what I, too would like to do if I have any contact possibilities ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't know what my current balance is. I think I registered in November after the German LiveCasino ban came into force in October for potential license applicants next summer.</p>
<p>Say Casinoin implemented the new regulations too late in principle because they accepted players from Germany until January, so it should actually be difficult for them to participate in the licensing process at all.</p>
<p>It currently looks in such a way that probably only German players can no longer access their accounts. Thus, no debiting of remaining credit is possible. Furthermore, I am not aware of the fact that the casino transfers remaining credit on its own. This procedure would also not be common in the industry.</p>
<p>I still have accounts at other live casinos that were also affected by the ban, but there I was still able to access and debit my account or at least continue to play slots.</p>
<p>A short statement from Casinoin would be important to me, because I will certainly not be the only German player there who is at a loss. I also want to know how much my balance is. If it's less than 10 â‚¬, it's free, if more, please put it back in my EcoPayz wallet.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Janosch</p>
