<p>Dear 4hghdrd54k,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"2.11. Bonus money offered in standard and reload , in whose terms it is not stated otherwise, is not cashable. After 35x deposit + bonus wagering is completed, you will be able to withdraw only the real winnings and the money from your real-money balance, while bonus amount will void.The maximum cashable cap with every bonus claimed is 5000 EUR (or the equivalent in any other currency) for deposit made over 50 EUR (or the equivalent in any other currency). Any deposit match bonus promotions triggered with deposits equal or below 50 EUR (or the equivalent in any other currency) will be subject to a max cap win of x 10 the amount of the original deposit "</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if your withdrawal of €500 has been received already?</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint as unjustified. I wish I could be of more help. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
