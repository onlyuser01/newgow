<p>Lazio vs. Napoli is arguably the most soccer game on the planet this coming weekend. This Serie A game is played at Rome’s Stadio Olimpico on Sunday, January 28, 2024, with a noon kickoff</p>
<p>Neither Lazio nor Napoli is satisfied with their position in the Italian Serie A standings right now, but there’s plenty of time left for them to improve. We’ve just passed the half point of the 2023-24 campaign, with another 18 games left for each team to play.</p>
<p>That’s plenty of time, but there’s no room for failure, which is why the Lazio vs. Napoli game on Sunday is likely to be a real banger.</p>

<p>Lazio Players Want to Keep Their Good Run Going</p>
<p>Lazio is sitting in the No. 6 position in the Serie A with a 10-3-7 record, which accounts for 33 points. This team’s goal is to finish in the Top 4 and book a ticket to the Champions League. The problem is that the same is the plan of a few other teams, including Napoli.</p>
<p>The good news for Lazio is that these guys have been playing great lately, winning their last four games in Serie A. However, all of those wins happened against teams from near the bottom of the table – Empoli (19th position), Frosinone (13th), Udinese (16th), and Lecce (14th).</p>
<p>The last time they played a league game against a team from the top half of the table, they lost. The game in question was against the table-leader Inter Milan. Lazio lost that game 2-0 at home.</p>
<p>Now, they play a home game against the defending champion, but the good news for the Romans is that they’ve got a good recent record against Napoli.</p>
<p>Napoli Ready to Challenge for a Spot in Europe</p>
<p>Napoli is 9-4-7 on the season with 31 points. That’s not too bad, but the competition is fierce, which is why these guys mustn’t lose focus.</p>
<p>They started the year with a humiliating 3-0 to Torino. They then went on to beat Salernitana 2-1 at home, with the winning goal scored in the 6th minute of stoppage time.</p>
<p>They did alright in the Italian Super Cup, beating Fiorentina 3-0 and giving a hard fight to Inter Milan in the Final. They ended up losing 1-0, with the only goal scored in stoppage time. What’s also interesting is that Napoli was playing with ten men on the pitch after Giovani Simeone received a red card.</p>
<p>Lazio vs. Napoli Prediction</p>
<p>If you compare these two player-for-player, these two are very similar. Both teams are also very motivated to win, as they have basically the same goals for the season. We expect a real battle at Stadio Olimpico, probably with goals on both ends. But who’s going to win? We think neither team.</p>
<p>Pick: Lazio vs. Napoli – Draw</p>
