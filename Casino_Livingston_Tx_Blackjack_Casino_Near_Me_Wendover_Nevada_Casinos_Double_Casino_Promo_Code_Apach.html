After conducting a thorough review of your gaming activity, we regret to inform you that we have identified violations of our casino rules (as outlined in sections 10.1, 10.2 of our Terms and Conditions, as well as Bonus Terms and Conditions, specifically about wagering requirements).</p>

<p>10.1 The Company has a strict anti-fraud policy and utilizes various anti-fraud tools and techniques. The Company considers the following actions as fraudulent including, but not limited to:</p>

<p>fraudulent actions against other online casinos or payment providers;</p>
<p>provision of counterfeit documents;</p>

<p>provision of incorrect registration data;</p>
<p>provision of counterfeit documents.</p>
<p>10.2 Other types of cheating and bonus abuse. While playing with an active bonus, it is forbidden to engage in activities that give the player a clearly unfair advantage. Such activities include, but are not limited to, these:</p>
<p>Delaying game rounds in any game, including free spins and bonus features, to a later time when you have no wagering requirements.</p>
<p>Leaving large bets on the table, for example in blackjack, and returning to the game after bonus wagering has been completed.</p>

<p>Using strategies that take advantage of any software bug or failure.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to void bonuses and any winnings from such bonuses in case of bonus abuse.</p>
<p>Casino Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions:</p>
<p>While wagering an active bonus on Instant Games, the player should cash out (whether manually or using the Auto-Cashout feature) at multiplier x1.5 or higher. Otherwise, it shall be considered fraudulent behavior. In such a case, BlueChip reserves the right to void (confiscate) any or all the player's bonus amounts.</p>
<p>In your case, your account was closed and funds were confiscated based on identified violations.</p>
<p>Dear Peter, we have already provided all the necessary documents to you via email. Please let us know if you require any additional documentation or if there are further inquiries on your part.</p>
