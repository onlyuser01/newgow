<p>Online gaming aggregator and provider of one-of-a-kind titles Relax Gaming has added another gem to its already successful series of Viking-themed slots with high volatility. Volatile Vikings 2 Dream Drop is the freshest jackpot game joining the prestigious line-up. The game is packed with exciting features ranging from Free Spins bonuses, a Multiplier Reveal, and the much-anticipated Dream Drop Jackpot with five potentially life-changing jackpot alternatives.</p>

<p>Take the Seas With the Mighty Vikings</p>
<p>Players are invited to grab their sharpest axes and conquer the seas in this slot with cool graphics and a Viking-style atmosphere. The game resembles the original Volatile Vikings slot in terms of “gripping features and mechanics”, as described by Relax Gaming’s chief executive officer Simon Hammon. Simmon expressed the company’s delight to be able to present the third game in the series to players eager to test out the much-anticipated progressive jackpot feature added for even more excitement.</p>
<p>Volatile Vikings 2 Dream Drop comes with a cascade mechanic part of a cluster scheme that lets players catch several winning combos at a time. To get coins, players need to gather between eight and 12 characters, where premium characters pay 50x the initial stake. The game also features multiplier symbols up to 100x. These are located on the third and fourth reels. There are also bonus symbols that could bring players free spins.</p>
<p>Multiplier Reveal, Free Spins &amp; Dream Drop Jackpot</p>
<p>When the Multiplier Reveal is triggered, every start of every spin has two Multiplier Reveal symbols on the third and the fourth reels. Each symbol has its own counter and multiplier marked on it. The counter decreases by one unit every time the player comes across a winning cascade. When the counter reaches zero, the multiplier is engaged. This means all the nearby symbols are smashed, making room for fresh symbols. Landing three bonus symbols triggers the Free Spins bonus. An extra symbol awards one extra free spin.</p>
<p>The game’s hottest attraction is also one of the highlights of the slot industry: the Dream Drop Jackpot. This jackpot is triggered at random moments and allows players to win any of the five available progressive jackpots: Rapid, Midi, Maxi, Major and Mega.</p>
<p>In June, Relax Gaming added Apparat Gaming to the Powered by Relax platform in order to offer it maximum exposure in Europe and beyond.</p>
