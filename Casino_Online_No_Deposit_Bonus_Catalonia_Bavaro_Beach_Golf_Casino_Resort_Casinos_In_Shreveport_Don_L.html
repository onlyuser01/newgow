<p>Asia Pioneer Entertainment (APE) and Jade Entertainment have entered a new partnership that will allow both companies to benefit and expand their product offerings in Macau.</p>
<p>Effectively, APE will deploy its advanced services and technical support with Jade Entertainment. Jade Entertainment founder and CEO Joseph Pisano welcome the opportunity to establish this fresh partnership between the companies:</p>
<p>Partnering with APE to deliver our cutting-edge bespoke gaming technology and solutions to top Macau casinos will allow us to strengthen our portfolio strategies. Jade Entertainment founder and CEO Joseph Pisano</p>
<p>APE Will Leverage Its Expertise to Help Jade’s Macau Expansion</p>
<p>Jade Entertainment is happy to have APE onboard and benefit from the firm’s distinct experience in the Macau market. Through this tie-up, APE will leverage its expertise and knowledge to help Jade Entertainment expand its product offering and reach audiences and operators.</p>
<p>Macau itself is in the midst of rapid overhaul with the Special Administrative Region is now going to re-regulate the way that casino concessionaires operate. In short, casinos that wish to continue operating in the SAR would need to meet tax revenue contributions, shift their focus on overseas customers and generally continue to boost the local economy.</p>
<p>Jade Entertainment is for the most part focused on the market in the Philippines where it distributes and supplies electronic gaming machines (EGMs) and various other systems to gaming venues and hotels in the country. This new collaboration with APE will enable the company to expand its reach.</p>
<p>Macau Is Undergoing Rapid Changes in Its Casino Industry</p>
<p>APE CEO and executive director Herman Ng was similarly pleased with the partnership and the opportunity it revealed:</p>
<p>I am delighted that we have established this partnership with Jade at this time. APE has been dedicating its business to introduce innovative and superior gaming products to casino operators. APE CEO and executive director Herman Ng</p>
<p>Ng confirmed that APE will seek to assist Jade Entertainment in securing its Macau footprint and continue to deliver excellent products. This comes at a time when Macau is experiencing a slight resurgence in the overall cases of COVID-19. Regardless, China has decided to reintroduce cross-border travel, although health authorities remain hawkish about the country’s zero-COVID policy.</p>
