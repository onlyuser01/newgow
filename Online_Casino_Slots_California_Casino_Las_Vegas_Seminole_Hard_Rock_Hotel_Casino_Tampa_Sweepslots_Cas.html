<p>The Ravens and 49ers are seen as leading Super Bowl candidates, with DraftKings listing Baltimore (+333) and San Francisco (+650) among its top four picks to win a championship this season.</p>
<p>Ravens, 49ers Among Championship Favorites</p>
<p>Both are also narrow second-choices to win their conferences, with the New England Patriots and New Orleans Saints favored to win the AFC and NFC titles, respectively.</p>
<p>Neither team is in any danger of missing the playoffs. But each is still playing for a shot at home-field advantage in the postseason, and this game gives each side a chance to prove its mettle against an elite opponent. That’s especially true for San Francisco: while the Ravens already have an impressive win over the Patriots, the Niners have yet to play a leading Super Bowl contender in the regular season. They’re now about to face two in a row between the Ravens and New Orleans.</p>
<p>But while the outside world may see this as a special matchup, 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo says that it’s business as usual for his team.</p>
<p>It’s pretty much been like that the whole year, so we embrace it,” Garoppolo told reporters, speaking of the doubts that San Francisco can hang with Baltimore. “I think we have a good mindset in the locker room. Guys aren’t looking at the game any differently than we have any other week. Just kind of how we go about our business.”</p>
<p>Two Week 13 Games Critical in AFC Wild Card Race</p>
<p>Two of the most important matchups in Week 13 feature AFC teams that are in the hunt for the conference’s final playoff position. While the Buffalo Bills (9-3) are in command of the first wild card spot, five teams are all within one game of the sixth seed.</p>
<p>That includes the Tennessee Titans (6-5) and the Indianapolis Colts (6-5), who will meet at Lucas Oil Stadium. The game also carries divisional implications, as both teams are just one game back of the Houston Texans for the AFC South lead. The Colts come in as a one-point favorite in a game that both teams likely need to win to realistically keep their playoff hopes alive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh Steelers (6-5) will host the Cleveland Browns (5-6) in a rematch of the Week 11 game that ended in a brawl between the two teams. The fight happened after Myles Garrett ripped off Steelers quarterback Mason Rupolph’s helmet and hit him with it, resulting in an indefinite suspension for Garrett.</p>
<p>The Browns won that game, and are a two-point road favorite for the rematch as well. Cleveland coach Freddie Kitchens sparked more controversy this week by wearing a “Pittsburgh started it” t-shirt on social media, though he has said that he wants he team to ignore all the talk around the altercation in the previous game.</p>
<p>I want them to go in with one thing and one thing only on their minds,” Kitchens told reporters during a conference call on Monday. “I want guys to show up ready to do their job. All of that other stuff is just fluff.”</p>
<p>Those interested in the AFC playoff picture will also want to watch the Sunday Night Football game, in which the New England Patriots (10-1) are a three-point road favorite while traveling to take on the Houston Texans (7-4), who currently lead the AFC South.</p>
