    <h1>Stage Door Casino Hard Rock Cafe Casino Casino Montgomery Alabama Tioga Downs Casino Flamingo Casino</h1>

<p>I know you already are having problems getting complaints resolved but figured what the heck. They need to be reported as any other scam company that's out there but not sure who that would be or where to turn besides here. I have $424 dollars in no deposit bonuses and haven't deposited with them yet(thankfully). I wasn't even trying to make the withdrawal request yet because wasn't sure how much playthrough was even left. I did click the withdrawal button though because was having a hard time finding how much was left to playthrough. The only option was to have a check mailed or money wired. I figured hell in case I am able to win any actual money, lets just make sure all of my info is correct and chat with someone to get the verification process moving. I already know about all the hoops you have to jump through to actually get them to approve anything. I wish I would've seen the reviews first but thankfully I found this site. When I clicked my info it said I was in Illinois instead of Indiana. I honestly don't think I clicked it but maybe I did I don't remember. Anyways I clicked Indiana and hit save and it tells me my username can only contain characters or numbers and resets my state back to Illinois. I've already registered over a week ago and my username is hurls80. Also there's no way to update your username in that area. I clicked chat for support and the told me that I had to deposit money for them to have full access to my account and they would make the changes. I told them that it's unlawful for any business to actually have complete access to your account to make changes like that and was in the process of telling him he was either trying to bribe me or threaten me I wasn't sure but the abruptly ended the conversation. Attached are screenshots of the conversation and also the error screen when I tried to update to correct information.</p>
