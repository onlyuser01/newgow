    <h1>Asbury Park Casino Hammond Indiana Casino Facebook Cashman Casino Ilani Casino Washington Yaamava Re</h1>

<p>Good evening to all,</p>
<p>This is my first post. Please understand,</p>
<p>My problem is as follows:</p>
<p>I deposit 1/9 hour 250 euros.</p>
<p>I win about 2600 euros in slots.</p>
<p>I make withdrawals of 2342 euros</p>
<p>I am correctly withheld tax of around 450 to 500 euros.</p>
<p>Then I deposit 350 euros.</p>
<p>I win about 150 euros in blackjack.</p>
<p>While these 500 euros are available, suddenly the system adds them to the tax, resulting in a total tax of -€1,029.78 being taken from my account</p>
<p>In other words, the PRINCIPAL of the deposit has been withheld for tax, plus the 150 euros I won.</p>
<p>I've been trying since yesterday to get rid of the customer service which just transfers requests.</p>
<p>The response I got to the official complaint is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Player,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the communication.</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that the tax was not deducted for each session but retroactively due to a technical error as a result of which your tax was deducted in total for all sessions won. For example if on the first day the tax from the profits was €15 and it was not withheld due to the technical issue we had and the next day the tax was €20, the total amount that will be deducted is €35. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused by the event.''</p>
<p>The deposit-withdrawal activity in the last 30 days, not like the last six months, even for the retroactive period they mention is the one I described above and between August 28 and 29 I deposited 600 euros and withdrew 600 euros.</p>
<p>There is no previous session</p>
<p>With simple math, the profits corresponding to 1029 euros are 5145€!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>I have also requested bwin to send me the recorded conversations with customer service as well as to present in detail what amount the tax of -€1,029.78 corresponds to.</p>
<p>I have sent the same email with the transactions attached to the gaming commission and again to bwin,</p>
<p>I would appreciate any input.</p>
