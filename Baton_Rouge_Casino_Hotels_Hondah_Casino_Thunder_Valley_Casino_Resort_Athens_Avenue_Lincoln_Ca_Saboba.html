<p>It remains unclear whether Tucker Carlson will run for the 2024 election but what's certain is that he parted ways with FOX News</p>
<p>The American conservative political commentator and TV personality, Tucker Carlson, is no longer a part of FOX News Media, the company confirmed Monday. The famous host is one of the most recognizable faces of the network since 2017. FOX News Media unveiled that Carlson’s last program aired on Friday, April 21, 2023. A statement released by the company explained: “Fox News Tonight will air live at 8 PM/ET starting this evening as an interim show helmed by rotating FOX News personalities until a new host is named.”</p>
<p>“FOX News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways. We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor,“ reads a statement released by FOX News Media</p>
<p>The media company said that it has “agreed to part ways” with Carlson. FOX thanked the famous political commentator for his service and acknowledged his positive contributions throughout his career as a televisionary. No specific details were released describing why FOX and Carlson decided to part ways. Still, the decision comes during a turbulent time for the media company, amid its lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems. Local media outlets revealed last week that FOX News agreed to settle the legal battle with Dominion for $787 million.</p>
<p>Will Tucker Carlson Join the 2024 Run?</p>
<p>Carlson’s sudden departure from FOX comes at a time when it was rumored, he may run for president in 2024. In the UK, famous bookmakers such as Ladbrokes, BetVictor and Coral offer odds on political outcomes and Carlson is one such option. Now, in light of the announcement by FOX that it decided to part ways with the famous political commentator, the 2024 odds by the bookmakers were cut. While such options are available in the UK, bookmakers in the US aren’t allowed to offer odds on political outcomes.</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether Carlson will join the 2024 run. However, Mike Madrid, a Republican strategic and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, was recently interviewed by Politico and noted that the former FOX host may be the only one that has a chance to beat Trump. “If he wanted the nomination, I think he’s really the only person who could beat Donald Trump. He’s truly the tip of the spear on defining what Republicans are going to be opposed to on literally any given night,” explained Madrid.</p>
<p>The strategist explained that Carlson already has the necessary influence as well as the audience. Madrid noted that if he would give Carlson advice it would be to “start the media chatter” and declare: “This is not the end, this is the beginning.”</p>
