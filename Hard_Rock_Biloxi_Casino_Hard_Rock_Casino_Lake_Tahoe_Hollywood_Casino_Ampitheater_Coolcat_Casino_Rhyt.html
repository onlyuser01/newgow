<p>Manufacturer of casino equipment and supplier of online gaming content International Game Technology (IGT) announced the first-ever omnichannel Wheel of Fortune linked progressive across land-based, mobile and online will be unveiled at the SBC Summit North America 2021.</p>
<p>Link Jackpots across Land-Based, Mobile and Online</p>
<p>The Wheel of Fortune linked progressive will be part of the company’s booth at the SBC Summit North America 2021, slated to take place from November 30 to December 2 at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Speaking about the soon-to-launch omnichannel Wheel of Fortune, IGT Digital &amp; Betting CEO Enrico Drago outlined the company was “once again breaking barriers in the digital gaming space.”</p>
<p>We are combining proven technology with the most successful slot brand of all time to create a powerful jackpot liquidity pool that engages players and delivers life-changing wins for New Jersey residents playing across channels. SBC Summit attendees will be among the first in the U.S. to see how the technology works.” Enrico Drago, CEO Digital &amp; Betting, IGT</p>
<p>The industry-first technology will link IGT’s digital Wheel of Fortune Gold Spin Triple Gold game with all land-based $1 Wheel of Fortune wide-area progressives to create a shared pool of progressive jackpot liquidity across brick-and-mortar casinos and online in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The link will provide players in the Garden State with choice as to when and where they want to play their favorite $1 Wheel of Fortune games, vying for the same large-scale jackpots that are usually features of land-based casinos across all three channels: land-based, mobile and online.</p>
<p>The launch of the Wheel of Fortune linked progressive was made possible through the Powerbucks link that has proved successful in Canada since its launch in 2016 to become the first omnichannel connected jackpot in the world.</p>
<p>Other IGT Offerings on Display</p>
<p>IGT is also planning to display at the summit a sequel of its top-performing Fortune Coin games in 2020, Fortune Coin Boost!, as well as PlayCasino games, including Great Bear and MegaJackpots Elephant King.</p>
<p>IGT’s CrystalFlex and PeakBarTop Flex cabinets and multigame software, including Game King X content, will also feature at the company’s booth, showcasing IGT’s capabilities to enable players to use the same machine and its funds to watch sports, place bets and try their luck on slot games, video poker and keno.</p>
<p>IGT PlaySport solution will display the scope of the company’s trading advisory services team, how cashless wagering is done on its PlaySports Kiosk and why the sports betting solution is the most widely used by sports betting operators in the US.</p>
<p>Recently, IGT announced that a public listing of the group’s newly-formed Digital &amp; Betting division is considered as part of a strategic review for future development.</p>
