<p>Instant Win Gaming (IWG) has hailed New Hampshire Lottery’s latest success which features the rollout of the lottery’s 100th eInstant game. The iLottery was launched four years ago in 2018 and it has been able to quickly build momentum, delivering a range of new experiences and games for consumers to enjoy.</p>
<p>Instant Win Gaming Hails Arrival of 100th eInstant Game</p>
<p>The 100th edition to the lottery’s portfolio is a game called Holiday Stacked Cash, a seasonal game developed by IWG. The gameplay comes with a free play feature where only the most valuable symbols will result in a win, but also boosting the overall potential for a win.</p>
<p>With today’s launch, the eInstant game is also supported by a one-day promotion which can be claimed today, December 7. Players who make a qualifying deposit at the New Hampshire Lottery will get 100 free spins to use on Holiday Stacked Cash as well. IWG CEO Rhydian Fisher hailed this timely launch and said:</p>
<p>Everyone at IWG congratulates the New Hampshire Lottery on such a tremendous milestone, as well as the creativity to offer a fun and exciting promotion to celebrate its 100th eInstant game release. It sums up why the New Hampshire Lottery has one of the most successful iLottery programs in the world. IWG CEO Rhydian Fisher</p>
<p>New Hampshire Lottery executive director Charlie McIntyre was similarly thrilled with the opportunity to see the launch of the 100th eInstant title at the lottery. It’s an example, McIntyre explained, of the lottery’s latest efforts to make sure that players have more ways to win.</p>
<p>He confirmed that the iLottery is committed to growing its list of eInstant games and to consistently deliver on new products that are tailored to engage with audiences and deliver on the level of fun expected from the lottery. Thanks to the addition of fresh games, McIntyre said, the New Hampshire iLottery can guarantee that it continues to contribute to the state’s schools.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IWG has been growing its global footprint. The company entered into a partnership with the Atlantic Lottery Corporation in October and obtained a license in Ontario, its 28th jurisdiction at the time.</p>
