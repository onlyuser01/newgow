<p>The Grand National weekend is now over but the memory of it will stay with bettors, sports fans, and companies that realized a tidy profit out of it. One of the companies to benefit fully from the most recent horse racing meetup was Entain which reported that its Coral and Ladbrokes have accepted a total of 12.75 million.</p>
<p>Grand National Stirs Excitement with Bettors</p>
<p>This constitutes the highest number on record and has been occasioned by a constellation of factors. For once, many sports fans were happy to return to watch the event live, whetting their appetite for a casual flutter. The Grand National has been on shutdown since 2019 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But the pent-up demand leading to this year’s edition has contributed to a bigger and sizable activity fueled by both retail operations but also online betting platforms, which are often the same brands. The Grand National has set a record and Entain reported that the second day of the event on Saturday was also its busiest to date. There was a total of 4.1 million bets placed across the various markets, up 72% from 2021.</p>
<p>Breaking down the numbers further, Entain confirmed that it had accepted 20,000 bets per minute in the lead-up. The event drew a huge online crowd, with Entain confirming that it saw 538,000 online users access the betting markets through the Coral and Ladbrokes brands. For all intents and purposes, the Grand National has been a raging success and no less.</p>
<p>The Event Returned and Entain Was Prepared</p>
<p>Speaking and commenting on this development, Entain deputy director for digital Dom Grounsell said that the company was pleased to welcome the event back after a long hiatus. He added:</p>
<p>“We pulled out all the stops to add to the moments of excitement for our customers across all our brands, apps and shops, and we were the only major operator to provide uninterrupted service from our platform and our customer support teams.” Entain deputy director for digital Dom Grounsell</p>
<p>Grounsell continued by adding that Entain remains committed to bringing fans some of the best experiences in sports and racing. Whether people need an in-person or interactive betting platform, Entain is prepared to bring a transformative experience to the fore.</p>
