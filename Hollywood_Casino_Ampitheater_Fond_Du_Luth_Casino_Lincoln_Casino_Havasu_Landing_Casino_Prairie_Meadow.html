<p>One of the most prominent iGaming suppliers and developers of content, Yggdrasil, is now making another stride in the Latin American market. The company has confirmed in a press release shared via email that it is preparing to enter the City of Buenos Aires in Argentina.</p>
<p>This is possible through approval by the local regulator, the Lotería de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, or LOTBA. Thanks to this regulatory approval, Yggdrasil will be able to bring itself to speed quickly and offer local operators a large selection of slot games and popular features.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil is the author of the original GATI technology which the company developed in-house and the YG Masters program that delivers fresh iGaming experiences and allows players to benefit from truly unique gameplay.</p>
<p>The company also brings a set of promotional tools and worthwhile options such as the BOOST toolset and Game Engagement Mechanics (GEMs) among many other worthwhile features. As to the new opportunity, Yggdrasil is entering a fairly fresh market. The Argentinian capitalofficially launched regulated iGaming back in 2021, and it has been gathering momentum ever since.</p>
<p>Suppliers have shown interest in providing local operators with the necessary products to elevate their overall offer, which is precisely what Yggdrasil will do now, bringing both the YG Masters program and its GEMs to the fore. Yggdrasil, in the meantime, will benefit from this new regulatory approval by expanding into yet another Latin American market.</p>
<p>Just recently, the company received approval to push forward with its content in Colombia, and the company is looking to expand further in the region, which has a lot of untapped iGaming potential. Yggdrasil CEO Björn Krantz was pleased with the development.</p>
<p>"We are starting the year with a great milestone in achieving the approval to supply our content in the City of Buenos Aires," Krantz noted. Yggdrasil has been sure to maintain strong commercial momentum across the board.</p>
<p>The supplier recently teamed up with Relax Gaming for its GEMs which the company made available to the latter’s retail operations. Yggdrasil similarly formed a partnership in Germany with a strong local brand, Jokerstar.</p>
