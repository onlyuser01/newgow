    <h1>New Casino Sites Longhorn Casino Hotel Free Spins Online Casino Hard Rock Casino Fort Lauderdale Pra</h1>

<p>The one from Larry long for $200 they did not cancel my payment I won $260. They only allow a $500 a day withdrawal so if I hit something around 2 or $300 I will withdraw some of it so I don't wind up losing it. For instance Sunday june 19, I deposited $30 and wound up hitting a little over $260 so I turned in a redeem ticket for $220. $200 for me and $20 for a tip that I leave them on every withdrawal except for 1 or maybe 2 times. I have withdrawn money from them at least 10 times since I have been playing in the past 2 months or so. Never had a problem getting my money. I even hit a little over $8000 with them but they only allow $1000 max payment. $500 then in 24hrs you get $500 more. They actually let me withdraw $1500 on that one and cleared the rest. It is what it is on that, I knew the rules. Anyway on this last withdrawal I received from them for the $220 that I got 200, I left $40 on the game so I could continue playing. If I can't cash out the 500 max I always leave some money on the game so I can continue and try to get the max for the day. That is no surprise to them. So around 2 am Monday June 20 I started playing with the $40 that I had left on the game and actually hit for close to 400 went to the fishing games and started to tear it up. I got up over $1000, played it back down t0 around 300 started playing keno and got it back up to 8 or 9 hundred went back to slots and got it up to around $2200 dollars. I can't remember what games because I was so excited and when it felt like time to get out of a game I would go to another. It was a blast I was up and down but never got below my $1000 max withdrawal. So yesterday morning I sent a request in for $400 because I had drawn 100 off another game. They have several platforms. Ultramonster vpower golden city high roller ect. The one I am referring to on the 1000 was golden city. I withdrew 100 from vpower yesterday morning so I only requested 400 because that would have been the max for the day. Well about 10:30 am yesterday, and I can screen shoot the text, I got a message from vipgames stating that I needed to take the money out of the bank so the could issue me a withdrawal. I had 400 on the playing amout for the withdrawal already and left 900 in the bank so I could cash out again today. Anyway I took it all out and them there was a little over 1100 on the playing amount and I played it down to 1000 and some change. I'll have to look at the times on the text but they message me back and was asking something like they deposited the money back on the game which is bs. O have the whole conversation I can send if you would like. The final message said winnings void because I played with that 220 that I withdrew. Anything else you need just let me know thanks</p>
