    <h1>Free Online Casinos Games Top 10 Casinos In Vegas Ruidoso Inn Of The Mountain Gods Casino Lucky Eagl</h1>

<p>I wanted to share my experience at LordLucky with you and maybe even lodge a complaint..</p>
<p>I wanted to try out LordLucky and combined my first deposit with the bonus offered .. which went without any problems up until then ..</p>
<p>I was also able to enjoy playing the selected games with small amounts for a long time .. until the contribution reached the last 10 euros.</p>
<p>I then only registered with LL again after about 2 days and wanted to use the rest of the credit .. but that was NOT just possible anymore without me having to verify myself there .. why is that a must at the casino should because it is nowhere pointed out that it is part of the process.</p>
<p>I still uploaded my address &amp; ID documents..</p>
<p>These were then rejected without any real reason and asked in the live chat only the statement came with the videoident to make the person verification</p>
<p>but there are 3 ways to verify yourself (-Video &amp; Bank ID or via documents that I used.)</p>
<p>= Bank ID was selectable but not available due to bank institute</p>
<p>Then have again</p>
<p>Scanned account card, bank statement and identity card. And added what was rejected again..</p>
<p>On further questions why it was rejected</p>
<p>There were only statements from the customer service that there were moments when the bankid was still in a general queue until it was used...&amp;the only option would be determined by their license and the other two options should be used in other cases when needed.</p>
<p>When I asked OB and where it is in the terms and conditions.. they answered with ;</p>
<p>Sheaelst thought it would be so clear and is also nowhere that it would be part of the recording in the terms and conditions s.</p>
<p>Well, since all this seemed too dubious to me, I didn't want to accept it and I couldn't get any clear answers,</p>
<p>... I didn't even want to make friends with their VideoID solution and would rather give them the remaining money instead of being mentioned in the casino rules without a reason or a given explanation.</p>
<p>I had the chat log sent to me..</p>
<p>I would be interested to know if this is legal at all if there are no explanations mentioned.</p>
<p>LG Kitty</p>
<p>!! Wouldn't recommend this LordLuckyCasino to anyone!!!</p>
