<p>Hello, Fried666! We have investigated the issue thoroughly and as the result you should have received 150 EUR to your casino account as of now. Of course, I owe you an explanation: disputed funds had derived from playing with the certain deposit bonus (Bonus Crab), which has maximum allowed cashout 5x the initial bonus amount. You can find terms about it here: https://wazamba.com/en/rules: "1. 21. Annex 4. Bonus Crab</p>
<p>Bonuses:</p>
<p>&lt;..&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum amount which can be released from the bonus will be equal to 5x the initial bonus amount. For example: the maximum amount to be credited in the real balance from a 10 EUR bonus will be 50 EUR. "</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial problem was that the casino had not capped your winnings upon the transfer from the bonus money account to the real money account, therefore, you had been allowed to play with funds that should had been capped. Given that the intricacy of the situation, we have decided that the fair solution would be granting you with the maximum allowed sum, you could receive from the bonus - 150 EUR (5 times 30 EUR - the initial bonus amount). Casino team has agreed with our verdict and has informed us that 150 EUR had been credited to your casino account.</p>
<p>Please, let us know if you will withdraw funds in question and I will hold the complaint open until you receive them. Otherwise, I will close your complaint as resolved. If you will have any more questions - do not hesitate to reach out here or to my e-mail: pavel.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>and Merry Christmas</p>
