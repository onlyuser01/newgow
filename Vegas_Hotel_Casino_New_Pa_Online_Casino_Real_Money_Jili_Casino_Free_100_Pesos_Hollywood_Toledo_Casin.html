<p>BetOnline, Wild Casino and Sportsbetting.ag are just a few of Commission Kings’ brand to suffer the most significant cyber-attack in their history. The attack is ongoing at press time, clocking nearly 72 hours now.</p>
<p>Commission Kings Brand Come Under Sever Cyber Attack</p>
<p>BetOnline has been among the websites to experience heavy cyber-attack pummeling by unidentified parties, which managed to disrupt the service for all consumers. The attack began on October 16, and Commission Kings are working on the issue as of October 18, at press time.</p>
<p>BetOnline is part of Commission Kings, a popular affiliate program that encompasses several trusted and established brands. These brands include SportsBetting.ag and Wild Casino, among others.</p>
<p>The original message published on the BetOnline website states that the developer’s team is working through the issues as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>With over 20 years in business, BetOnline is experiencing what is the biggest attack against it, presenting the network with an unprecedented challenge.</p>
<p>BetOnline, one of the main brands under attack, issued regular updates over the past 72 hours. Saturday remained fairly quiet with little in the way of progress to report. A Saturday update had this to add:</p>
<p>“To our valued customers: We are taking every measure to resolve the website issues as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience and will continue to provide updates as soon as they are available.”</p>
<p>The continuous pressure to restore servers up and running quickly has brought out BetOnline brand manager, Dave Mason, a trusted community guru. Mason assured the community that all necessary measures have been taken and the team was working to restore access.</p>
<p>BetOnline and Mason further reassured consumers that all complaints have been heard and taken into consideration. Mason added that they would pass along all new information as soon as it became available.</p>
<p>Around 16 hours ago, BetOnline issued an update about a “significant progress” in tackling the issue. A more concrete timeline is coming, the update says.</p>
<p>Shortly after, BetOnline confirmed that all sensitive information has been protected from the attack with consumers’ funds and balances intact. BetOnline further explained that all pending wagers are still active and valid.</p>
<p>The attack is ongoing but BetOnline and all Commission Kings’ brands seem to be closer to a resolution.</p>
