<p>iGaming Club, AffPapa’s largely successful networking event that will be taking place alongside iGaming NEXT Valletta, a prominent industry gathering. On the occasion of the latest edition of iGaming Club, AffPapa has revealed SlotsCalendar as the Photo Booth Sponsor for the event.</p>
<p>SlotsCalendar is itself an established name in the industry, providing players with a quick and reliable way to explore new slots, and upcoming releases, and catch themselves up on everything they need to know about existing games. SlotsCalendar is committed to industry innovation and the company is happy to be a part of the upcoming iGaming Club Malta 2023, which will be held on June 21-22.</p>
<p>This edition of iGaming Club Malta will span over two days and offer attendees all sorts of opportunities. The previous editions of the event were both sold out, and the one that is heading to Malta later this month is expected to bring even more people together. The networking event will be held at the Mediterranean Conference Center in Malta where the Valletta Summit takes place.</p>
<p>iGaming Club Malta will be preceded by the prestigious AffPapa iGaming Awards 2023 ceremony, before the networking opportunities can begin in earnest. AffPapa has developed many interesting formats that are specifically tailored to allow attendees to strengthen ties and get to know each other. That includes dedicated booth zones, speed-dating sections, lounge areas, and so much more.</p>
<p>As the Photo Booth Sponsor, SlotsCalendar will hold the location at N1. Commenting on this opportunity, SlotsCalendar CEO Viorel Stan had this to say:</p>
<p>"Whether you like it or not, competition is a part of our DNA. You can win, or you can lose. The important part is to enjoy a fair game, have a lot of fun, and do your best to improve each time!</p>
<p>That’s the mentality we all share at SlotsCalendar, which helped us achieve excellent results. With this recipe, AffPapa as an organizer, sunny Malta as the perfect host, and the iGaming elite as participants, a great show and fantastic networking session are guaranteed."</p>
<p>AffPapa Head of Commercials Yeva Avagyan was similarly excited about this opportunity and welcomed the opportunity to see SlotsCalendar become the event’s Photo Booth Sponsor. "Additionally, SlotsCalendar will showcase its presence with a dedicated booth at the iGC Malta event. We’ve had a long-standing partnership with the affiliate team, and this strengthens the ties even further," Avagyan concluded.</p>
<p>Attendees and interested parties may visit the iGaming Club Malta website and check attendance as well as sponsorship opportunities.</p>
