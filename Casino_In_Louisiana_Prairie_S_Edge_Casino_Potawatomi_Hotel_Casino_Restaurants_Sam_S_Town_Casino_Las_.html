<p>Blockchain-based games may finally have a reliable way to introduce randomness thanks to Chainlink VRF dedicated to solving current problems developers have experienced with making their products tamper-proof and provably fair.</p>
<p>Chainlink Debuts Verifiable Randomness to the Ethereum Network</p>
<p>Chainlink, a platform that fills the gap between smart contracts on the blockchain, has pioneered a new technology that allows the company to bring verifiable random functions (VRF) to boost fairness on the Ethereum network and create a tamper-proof solution similar to what iGaming uses as Random Number Generator (RNG).</p>
<p>The Chainlink VRF has been released in collaboration with developers and academics who have looked into how to create a smart contracts tech focused on making blockchain gaming safer, the company said in an official statement.</p>
<p>Why Does Blockchain Gaming Need Verifiable Randomness?</p>
<p>Chainlink believes that there are many parties who seek to deplete contracts of funds via clandestine practices. However, by introducing a VRF solution, this becomes much harder as the randomness would create products that are provably fair and offer “equal uncertainty” to all participants in the contract.</p>
<p>In other words, Chainlink makes it difficult for anyone to predict the next outcome bringing a new level of security to gaming. Chainlink focuses on both cryptographic proofs as well as confirming the randomness of outcomes.</p>
<p>1/ We’re excited to launch a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) capability. Smart contract developers can now access verifiable randomness through #Chainlink oracles, enabling a new set of blockchain applications in gaming, security &amp; layer-2 protocols. https://t.co/NBLPuzJyXE — Chainlink – Official Channel (@chainlink) May 12, 2020</p>
<p>The official update specifies that developers can “make games more trustworthy by using a source of randomness that is verifiable on-chain, allowing developers to provide additional proof to security-sensitive users.”</p>
<p>According to Chainlink, the introduction of randomness will also allow players to create more challenging and unpredictable scenarios and environments, randomizing rewards and drops.</p>
<p>Why Is Chainlink VRF Any Better Than Current Verification Technology?</p>
<p>According to Chainlink, the problem with existing solutions is that off-chain randomness is difficult to place on-chain. Another specific of the current method is the use of blockhash chain data.</p>
<p>Chainlink wants to avoid what it describes as over-dependence on blockhash randomness. In the update, the company explains that a coalition of miners, using the current randomness technology, might influence an outcome to create a 2/3 more likely outcome in the end, instead of the base line which is around 50% per outcome.</p>
<p>That specific blockhash shortcoming has prompted many to seek off-chain randomness solutions. However, this has led to its own set of problems, including inaccessibility or incompatibility between smart contracts.</p>
<p>Anyone who wishes to try the Chainlink VRF can do so. Developers are welcome to visit the documentation page available on the official website. Chainlink also runs a Discord channel where the community can exchange ideas.</p>
