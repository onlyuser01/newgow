    <h1>Blackjack Casino Near Me Casinos In Sparks Nevada Cachuma Casino Ginger Casino Casino At Dania Beach</h1>

<p>STAY AWAY FROM THEM THEY ARE THIEVING SCAMMERS!!</p>
<p>I normally play jokaroom they are great only take a couple of days to withdraw my money and don’t charge anything. I went to play and the site was shut for maintenance lol so I went elsewhere. Normally I check reviews and all that kind of thing but for some reason I STUPIDLY didn’t and went with house of pokies.</p>
<p>i never use the bonuses or free spins I just use my own money I put about $100 in and won $2600. I assumed there would be a process with the document verification and I would have to wait a couple or days so I was cool with that.</p>
<p>With jokaroom I only waited about a day and it was all done with great communication.</p>
<p>I upload all my documents to house of pokies on their site and I sent them an email and it says they will get back within 48 hours if the documents have been approved! Or they may require additional documentation which is weird because everything they ask for is all you need to show them. I can’t imagine what else they would need.....ANYWAYS! They approved one document out of 4 I uploaded almost instantly. The other 3 wernt approved until 6 days later!!!!</p>
<p>in that time I checked the reviews and then I was freaking out I wasn’t going to get my money.</p>
<p>I started an online chat with telling them I had read the reviews they are blacklisted and I found it weird why they would approve one document straight away but not the rest.... I screenshoted everything from every conversation with their ‘customer service agents’ (which by the way they have photos of them you can see when you chat with them and they look too professional like they have stolen real estate agents photos or something lol)</p>
<p>anyway....they continuesly assured me I would get my money I spoke to 7 different ‘customer service agents’ throughout the week who all had different answers to time frames of how long things took. One said it takes 4-6 business days for documents to be approved and then another 48 hours pending another approval after there already approved!!!</p>
<p>so 6 days later I get the email they get approved. I checked it they ALL said approved and not ‘uploaded’ anymore.</p>
<p>I go check it again about an hour later and they added another document of my bank statement and it said ‘uploaded’ I went to the chat and she said I had to wait for approval again to withdraw when it was all approved when I never added that last duplicate document that didn’t need to be added again as it was already there and had been approved....... weird...</p>
<p>I waited another week for my withdrawal. The whole time it just sat there saying ‘pending approval’ it’s supposed to take 48 hours to be approved as they say.... but NOTHING!!!</p>
<p>Just excuses after excuses with different customer service agents saying different things none of their knowledge is the same.</p>
<p>everytime I brought up the fact they were rated the worst casino who never pay out withdrawals they would just ignore what I said or not reply. the first guy I spoke to in the chat told me that I should’ve read the terms and conditions basically stating that whatever happens isn’t there problem and they aren't liable for ANYTHING. I didn’t read the terms and conditions after he said that lol I should’ve done it before signing up.</p>
<p>ALSO THEIR CASINO ISN’T LICENSED!!! So join at your own risk!</p>
<p>the site doesn’t have an option to close your account I had to ask another person in the chat how to close it. I asked them 9 times!!! And even told her to listen to what I’m saying I don’t care what she says I want to close it..she tried 2 more times after that to make me keep it open.</p>
<p>she made me verify my information in the chat and then she deleted the account (if it’s actually deleted though I can’t log in but I still believe it would be in their system because THEY CHARGE YOU A FEE IF YOU DON’T LOG INTO YOUR ACCOUNT AFTET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DAYS. No other casino ever does that????</p>
<p>I freaked out and CANCELLED my bank card as I’ve read terrible reviews saying once they asked to close the account money starting coming out from random places.</p>
<p>I told them no other casino takes this long they are unprofessional but they just ignored me.</p>
<p>excuses after excuses. Not professional at all. They don’t even have a FAQ on their site it’s very basic nothing like the other sites!</p>
<p>Time frames are a lie. It’s a scam for sure!!!</p>
<p>It is my own fault for not researching them first but LESSON LEARNT!!</p>
<p>STAY AWAY FROM HOUSE OF POKIES IF YOU KNOW WHATS GOOD.</p>
