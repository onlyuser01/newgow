    <h1>Choctaw Broken Bow Casino Harrahs Casino Hotel Mr Beast Casino Blackoak Casino Murphy Nc Casino Pari</h1>

<p>Pariplay, a NeoGames company, has introduced its dedicated Wizard Games content in the regulated iGaming market in Germany through an alliance with ZEAL, an online lottery operator with a firm foothold in the country and growing popularity among players of all stripes.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s introduction of Wizard Games content allows players to experience outstanding titles developed by the studio and deliver innovative and creative themes, gameplay features, and engagement opportunities.</p>
<p>The first title to be introduced is Dragons of the North, a fantasy-themed slot that offers a standard 5-reel, 3-row grid, and features ferocious dragons who have awoken to set the setting for exciting gameplay.</p>
<p>With ZEAL’s most recent launch into the Instant Games vertical, Wizard Games is in a great position to strengthen the operator’s offer and help it drive better engagement and retention across the board.</p>
<p>Wizard Games is injecting its portfolio into ZEAL’s library through Pariplay’s Fusion platform, which will potentially bring more titles to ZEAL and other partner operators in future.</p>
<p>Pariplay has welcomed the opportunity to expand further into a new jurisdiction, hailing the alliance with ZEAL as a significant step forward. Pariplay Chief Commercial Officer Enrico Bradamante has welcomed the opportunity, and said that the German iGaming market was indeed of strategic significance to the company and its Fusion platform.</p>
<p>"ZEAL is one of the country’s leading lights and we can’t wait to see how Wizard Games content performs with its players," Bradamante said.</p>
<p>A similar sentiment was expressed by ZEAL Instant Games Managing Director Julian Tietz, with whom Casino Guru News spoke recently in an interview, and who hailed the opportunity to see his company’s offer strengthened by the established supplier.</p>
<p>This partnership with Pariplay would allow the company to grow its business, Tietz said confidently, welcoming the opportunity to populate the operator’s library with leading content from established suppliers.</p>
<p>"Through our cooperation, we are proud to be the first operator to bring Wizard Games to the German Market," Tietz said.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been busy in the meantime, with the company driving a steady foray into the North American market, and specifically the United States. Titles by Wizard Games have been introduced with a number of operators in the country, including Hard Rock Digital in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The supplier also launched its products with Rush Street Interactive in another big iGaming state – Pennsylvania earlier this year. Pariplay continues to grow its presence in both the regulated European iGaming market as well as beyond, including North and South America, Africa, and beyond.</p>
