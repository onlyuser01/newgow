    <h1>Big Easy Casino Wingate By Wyndham Lake Charles Casino Area Sky Ute Casino Resort Avant Garde Casino</h1>

<p>Good evening, I made a deposit at this casino, then I made a withdrawal of 401â‚¬ via bank transfer. I requested account cancellation citing addiction reasons and was informed that my account did not exist in their records, then I spoke with customer service Jeff and was told that it did exist and the withdrawal was cancelled and had to be manually processed. In fact, I received an email stating that the withdrawal had been cancelled. After stating that the withdrawal had to be manually processed, this happened on 18/01, in the chat they say I have to send an email with the correct bank details because they were incorrect so they didn't make the transfer. I sent the document with the bank details in the chat and by email, I received an email with the ticket number and in the chat, they say it was forwarded to the financial department. I sent the receipt about 4 times and the chat always says it has been received and is being processed by the financial department. On January 31st, I received an email informing me that the withdrawal has to be made to a Skrill account, I made the deposit through mbway which allows me to make withdrawals by bank transfer. I created a Skrill account, sent the details and the response is that everything is fine and is being processed by the financial department.</p>
<p>Having said that, I returned to the chat today to check the status and they are asking me again for bank details for bank transfer.</p>
<p>I ask for help with this, as everyone says something different, each one asks for something different, I have sent everything they asked for and see no way of getting my money.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
