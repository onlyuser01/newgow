    <h1>Jerry S Nugget Casino Nugget Casino Resort Reno Casinos Cerca Caesars Casinos Las Vegas Indian Casin</h1>

<p>i have been with this casino for a Is it never made a withdrawal previously. I knew they were not going to be accepting Australian After 31 January 2023 so on 30 January I received 25 free spins in my email as you needless to say I regularly deposited funds onto my account with them. I had a big win of $1700 , and played through the wagering requirements well &amp; truly. So I went to ensure all my doc’s had been verified and if courseIs my proof of address missing that after substantial emailing back they finally excepted the bank statement and not government letters as they imply is sufficient( I had my rego renewal from dept if transport wa. So finally they accepted bank statement and all sorted. So I was down to an amount of $1100.00 after cancelling withdrawal a few times so I could keep on playing.</p>
<p>as previously paid on occasion I withdrew to crypto and payment cstatus showed pending .</p>
<p>After 24 hours I sent an email to the security at like the joker asking about my payout as I knew they would not be operational Australia members after the 31st got no reply. I emailed again late on 31 January again querying whether or not they would honour the payout. I did read the terms and conditions again after the fact and then realised as players on different levels , they only like allow about $100 . Anyway I received an email Reply today being 1 February stating my withdrawal was void due to the fact that I had not made a deposit in the last five days prior to having the win. Strangely enough I read through the terms and conditions the free spins or free chips and general terms conditions of the casino and I don’t recall seeing a rule thanks for your payment has to be made five days prior to a withdrawal. Yet of course Now Australia is out of the jurisdiction I am Unable to log back into the site to revisit the terms and conditions. The admin staff My issue is now solved, but I don’t believe this is fair. They have never ever minded taking my money instead we are making deposits so technically they should refund all the deposits I made to their casino they also have listed is that site claiming that they have some of the highest percentages yet I never received one payout in the years as a regular player.</p>
<p>They are scammers and that’s not cool, as said previously, they should refund all my deposits, as if I have your cash in my account as well as spirit I would not have needed posit five days to having a win as I would’ve had more money in my account so that just doesn’t make sense.</p>
