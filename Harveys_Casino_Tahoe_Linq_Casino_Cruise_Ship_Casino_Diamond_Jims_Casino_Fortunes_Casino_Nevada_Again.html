<p>Nevada Again Tops Nation in Unemployment</p>

<p>For the second straight month, tourism-dependent Nevada led the nation in unemployment, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

<p>Nevada’s jobless rate in August was 7.7 percent. The next highest rates were in California and New York, at 7.5 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Nevada’s August rate was identical to the jobless total in July, when the state also led the nation in unemployment.</p>
<p>David Schmidt, Nevada’s chief economist, said the August numbers provide a look at how the state’s “economy responded to the emergence of the delta variant.”</p>
<p>In the summer, 12 of 17 Nevada counties were determined to have high COVID-19 transmission rates. The emergence of the delta variant has added to concerns in Nevada about rising infections. Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) recently issued a directive stating that COVID-19 is a “statewide public health crisis.”</p>
<p>Given these issues, Nevada’s unemployment figure is likely to remain one of the highest in the nation, “reflecting the long road left to a complete recovery in the state’s labor market,” Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Nebraska had the lowest jobless rate in August, at 2.2 percent. A total of 22 states had a jobless rate lower than the national average of 5.5 percent, while 13 states and Washington, D.C., had higher rates.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Joblessness Leads Nation</p>
<p>During two months this summer, Las Vegas led the nation’s large metropolitan areas in unemployment. This category includes 51 metro areas with a population of one million or more.</p>
<p>In June, 9.6 percent of the eligible Las Vegas workforce was unemployed. The jobless rate in July reached 9.4 percent. Both figures were the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas metropolitan area includes the downtown casino district and resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. The largest hotel-casinos on the Strip are in Clark County, outside Las Vegas city limits. The Las Vegas metro area also includes Henderson, about 16 miles southeast of downtown Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Las Vegas continues to lead the US in unemployment. But its single-digit rate is much lower than the nation-leading 34.2 percent jobless rate recorded last year in Las Vegas during an earlier stage of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Tourism Totals Going Up</p>
<p>As Nevada attempts to manage infection rates, tourism officials are working to attract visitors.</p>
<p>In Southern Nevada, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority recently released a television ad touting the region as a destination for sports fans. The ad does not show casino gambling or any gambling devices.</p>
<p>The number of tourists visiting Las Vegas is inching higher. However, the visitor volume is tracking well-below the record high of 42.9 million people who visited the city in pre-pandemic 2016.</p>
<p>This year, fewer than three million visitors a month have arrived in Las Vegas during its busiest periods.</p>
