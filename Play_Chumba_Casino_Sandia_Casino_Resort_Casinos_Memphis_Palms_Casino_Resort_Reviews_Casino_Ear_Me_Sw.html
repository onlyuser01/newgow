<p>Swintt, a prominent supplier of iGaming products, is continuing to grow its footprint in regulated markets across Europe. The latest such move is in the Dutch iGaming market which will now see the company deploy the full range of its games with a locally licensed operator, 711.</p>
<p>The partnership was signed earlier this month, Swintt confirmed, with players soon able to benefit from the company’s SwinttGames and SwinttPremium collections and portfolios. Swintt will also deliver on an array of experiences that go beyond that with SwinttStudios, an initiative that aggregates and distributes third-party games.</p>
<p>The Dutch market has proven particularly important to both companies, with 711 and Swintt both holding a license from the local regulator, Kansspelautoriteit and determined to continue carrying out and scaling their operations in the market. Swintt will be able to make further in-roads through this new tie-up while 711.nl will enhance the player experience by offering innovative games.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Swintt Chief Executive Officer David Mann said that he welcomed this opportunity to see the company’s certified games arrive at a prominent gaming brand in the country.</p>
<p>"As a popular and trusted Netherlands-based brand, they’ll provide the perfect platform for us to share our games with a wide new audience," Mann concluded. The news was naturally welcomed by 7111 Chief Operating Officer Gilles de Backer who added that Swintt has repeatedly proved itself to be one of the most ambitious and exciting developers of games.</p>
<p>The studio brings both classic and state-of-the-art games that 711 simply must have in order to bring local players the best possible experience, de Backer said. Speaking of, Swintt has plenty to offer.</p>
<p>Players at 711 will be able to access games such as Master of BooksUnlimited, Extra Win X, and Duolitos Garden among many innovative and promising titles that are bound to be some of the most coveted titles at the operator.</p>
<p>Both companies have been committed to growing their local footprint. To this end, 711 has been adding more suppliers through a number of content alliances, including the recently signed-up partnership with Push Gaming and Stakelogic.</p>
<p>Swintt, for its part, has been expanding with a number of content partnerships of its own. Notably, the company signed up with Betsson Group and its brands, a true testament to the long way that the company has come as a supplier and distributor of iGaming content over the past years.</p>
