<p>Las Vegas-based sports betting operator SuperBook Sports is expanding in one more US state with its sports betting mobile app being available to people in Iowa in addition to Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Jersey, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>SuperBook Sports Brings its Sports Betting Expertise to Iowa Residents</p>
<p>SuperBook Sports is now available in Iowa in addition to another five US states. Iowa residents can now download the SuperBook Sports mobile app or place bets at SuperBook.com.</p>
<p>SuperBook Sports CEO Mark Lipparelli expressed his excitement about the new market expansion saying: “From the Cyclones and Hawkeyes to the Field of Dreams, Iowa has one of the best sports traditions in the country. Many sports fans from Iowa have undoubtedly visited our iconic Las Vegas sportsbook, and now they can access those same great betting options from home.”</p>
<p>SuperBook Sports is a sports betting operator, which started operations in 1986 in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is currently in charge of the world’s largest retail sportsbook. SuperBook Westgate Las Vegas sportsbook spans over 35,000 square feet and offers the biggest video wall in the world.</p>
<p>Famous oddsmaker Jay Kornegay is SuperBook Sports’ current Vice President of Race &amp; Sports Book Operations. Together with other renowned team members, such as John Murray among others, the company has over 100 years of odds-making experience behind its back.</p>
<p>Kornegay expressed his excitement about the launch in Iowa as he considers sports fans in the state to be extremely insightful and dedicated. Kornegay also elaborated on SuperBook Sports’ special odds boosts and other bonuses and promotions. He highlighted that the company’s main focus is on offering its customers the most attractive odds.</p>
<p>SuperBook Sports has also hinted that the mobile app will soon be available in other US states.</p>
<p>Various Betting Operators Entered the Iowa Market This Year</p>
<p>SuperBook is one of several sports betting companies that have started to offer their services to Iowa residents this year.</p>
<p>Despite a noticeable slowdown in sports betting in the state during the summer, sportsbooks keep expanding in Iowa despite tough competition from major players such as BetMGM and Caesars Sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Sports betting and online casino MaximBet was the first to announce its expansion in Iowa at the beginning of this year. It was later followed by Smarkets, which in May announced that it has partnered with Affinity Interactive for its sports betting platform launch in the state.</p>
<p>In September, ClutchBet was another sportsbook that entered the Iowa market getting ahead of SuperBook Sports’ mobile app launch in October.</p>
