<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>The way I see it, this wagering (playthrough) requirement is not mentioned in the rules, yet you are familiar with this rule, right? Well, the casino should implement the requirements properly in order to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>You asked the chat operator - good step indeed, so now you know there is really 1x wagering. I'm quite convinced that once you manage to fulfill it, the withdrawal should be okay, at least from this point of view.</p>
<p>As for the rest of your current balance, I would say your expectation sounds reasonable, but I'd like to say it also depends on whether you got some bonus, or played with bonus funds. If I may guess, I'd say the tournament wins are considered bonus money until the requirements are met, but what was your balance before? Are those tournament funds kept separately from your real funds as long as the withdrawal is successfully made?</p>
<p>Since I do not know where you play and am not familiar with the tournament rules, I'm asking these questions.</p>
<p>I'll wait for an update.</p>
