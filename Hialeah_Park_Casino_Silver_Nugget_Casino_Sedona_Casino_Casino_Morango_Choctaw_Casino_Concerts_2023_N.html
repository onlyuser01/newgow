<p>A long-anticipated restriction on betting and gaming advertising finally came into effect this month, with the bans rolling out in both Belgium and the Netherlands on July 1. Both countries have demonstrated a determination to ensure that consumers are protected by going after some of the biggest emanators of potential harm.</p>
<p>This is why Belgium has chosen to pass new and tighter laws that encompass virtually every aspect of gambling advertisement, and include a ban on sports gambling sponsorships, such as the ones that are popular in the Premier League in the United Kingdom right now.</p>
<p>The only entity not impacted by the ban is the Belgian National Lottery, which is forwarding its proceeds to good causes. Belgium Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne has welcomed the implementation of the Royal Decree first introduced in May 2022 and passed with a firm majority.</p>
<p>Belgium and Van Quickenborne have been adamant in their determination to ensure that consumers are protected, passing stringent rules that all but prohibit gambling advertisements. Then, there is the measure passed by the Kansspelautoriteit, or Dutch Gambling Authority, as it’s known to English speakers.</p>
<p>The Dutch measures seem to be similarly restrictive, and just as focused on upholding and maintaining a good standard of consumer protection. Under the new Dutch law, operators operate under restriction when it comes to ads in public spaces, TV, magazines, newspapers, social media and radio, for example, or are altogether prohibited in certain cases.</p>
<p>This has been done to ensure that advertisement does not have an adverse impact on consumers – including children and young adults – who may be susceptible to gambling influences and develop a problem with the activity later on. The Dutch Gambling Authority has already confirmed that it is looking to uphold the new measures and is actively looking into any offender.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the government has been proactive in calibrating the industry in a way that it believes protects consumers in the best possible way. Role models are also prohibited in the Netherlands, which means that personalities that are particularly popular with young people cannot become brand ambassadors for gambling companies.</p>
<p>The Netherlands will also use something that has been described as "invisible measures." This may suggest that offending parties may not be immediately sanctioned publicly but rather through a backchannel – if any penalties apply during the first months of the prohibition.</p>
<p>However, the Dutch Gambling Authority has a solid track record of acting against offenders and is not hesitant when it comes to upholding gambling laws.</p>
