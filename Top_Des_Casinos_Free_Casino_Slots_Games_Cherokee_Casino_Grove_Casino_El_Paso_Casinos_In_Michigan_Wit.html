    <h1>Top Des Casinos Free Casino Slots Games Cherokee Casino Grove Casino El Paso Casinos In Michigan Wit</h1>

<p>On the 29th of August at 1:27 AM, I requested a withdrawal of 500â‚¬ (no bonus, all real money). According to your terms and conditions, withdrawals are processed within 3 working days after the application. This has not happened.</p>
<p>Before and after making my request, I asked at least 10 times to be verified. I wanted to know what documents I should submit, the answer was always the same: You don't need to be verified at the moment, if we need anything from you, the responsible department will contact you.</p>
<p>Another support representative told me that not every withdrawal requires verification. Yet another said I could send proof of identity and proof of address to support@quickwin or kyc@quickwin if I wanted to. I did that and also attached my online banking deposits. This was also on the 29th of August!</p>
<p>Despite this, I still can't verify myself, they keep telling me it's not necessary and that my withdrawal is in the final processing stage and so on and so forth. Each support staff provides me with a different excuse. One even told me yesterday that I would receive the withdrawal on the same day, which of course was not true. I seriously question why this casino has such a high security rating. I have read loads of complaints, both here and on Trustpilot (https://www.trustpilot.com/review/quickwin.com), ALL experiencing the same problem. The delays in withdrawals seem to be systematic. It's always the same trick.</p>
