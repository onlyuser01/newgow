<p>The regulatory authority tasked with overseeing horse racing in Great Britain, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA), announced a senior management level appointment. On Monday, the Authority said it appointed John Ferguson as a part of its Board. In his new role, Ferguson will leverage decades of horse racing industry experience. He takes over the position from Luca Cumani. The appointment comes after Cumani's term as a member of BHA's Board has come to an end.</p>
<p>Joe Saumarez Smith, BHA's chair, commented in a statement released on October 3, 2022. He said that the Authority is excited to see Ferguson join its Board. Moreover, Smith acknowledged that Ferguson "brings with him extensive experience of the training and bloodstock industries, alongside his intimate knowledge of the industry's workings from his time as a senior leader in the sport."</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Ferguson added: "Having had a career in horseracing that has been beyond my wildest dreams, working for some incredible people, I feel honored and privileged to have been offered this role." He pointed out that he has significant experience within the horse industry as a member of stable staff, but also in breeding, selling and owning horses. In conclusion, Ferguson revealed: "It is now in our hands to shape horseracing into a sustainable and fabulous sport for future generations."</p>
<p>Only recently, back in 2021, Ferguson established a bloodstock investment company called Natalma Bloodstock. Currently, the company has broodmares located around the world in Australia, the United States, as well as Europe. Besides setting up the bloodstock investment company, Ferguson has an owner's license from the Japanese Racing Association. Additionally, he is currently a member of the US Jockey Club and the UK Jockey club.</p>
<p>But Ferguson's experience within the horse racing industry doesn't end there. In fact, for more than two decades between 1994 and 2017, he represented Darley and Godolphin, the famous global stallion operation. During his tenure with Godolphin, Ferguson has held the position of Chief Executive.</p>
<p>Ferguson's professional background includes positions as stable staff, racing manager, bloodstock agent, breeder, owner as well as an assistant trainer. He served as an assistant trainer to Sir Michael Stoute and helped train 287 National Hunt winners.</p>
<p>Late last month, the BHA announced it opened the nominations for the Thoroughbred Industry Employee Awards 2023. The event which was formerly known as the Godolphin Stud &amp; Stable Staff Awards is sponsored by Godolphin and run by the BHA. The unique event seeks to celebrate and award employees from different areas of the thoroughbred industry.</p>
