    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Las Vegas Nevada Treasure Bay Casino Buffet Monarch Casino Black Hawk</h1>

<p>Hello, first of all I am not a bot and neither do I make an bad review because I lost my money. Second, sherbet only lets good reviews online and tries to remove all that are not positive, like mine. But I will keep going for everyone to see.</p>
<p>First of all, I thought this website might be a really good one, it has a nice design and the games work fluently.</p>
<p>Now for the bad parts,</p>
<p>There is an registry bonus for 75 Freespins on Sweet Bonanza. I won a bit of money out of it and had to wager 600€ or 650€, which I successfully did. Then I tried to claim my 50$ wager free cash from wagering OVER 600€!</p>
<p>Nothing, I couldn’t claim it. First I had to deposit 20€ in order to claim it, I did, obviously lost it. Now the fun began. After I deposited 20€ to get my 50$ finally, I was told I had to verify my account first. Which was already pending for a WEEK by that time!? A week to verify? Never seen before, then after 3 weeks of waiting to verify, the whole verify options was removed, and now it says „coming soon".</p>
<p>The customer support is kind, but doesn’t help in any way, imagine a Casino website making a user trouble, that wagered over 650€ to get 50$!!</p>
<p>After writing the support multiple times, I always got the same answer over and over again and nobody was even willing to help a tiny BIT!</p>
<p>Then the bonus expired, without me being able to do even the slightest thing about it. I mean how much of a scam can a single website possibly be?!</p>
<p>My username is JeffreyAllstars66 and I am waiting the 4th week for still no hope in sight. Don’t play on here, really don’t if u think about even being able to verify/ even withdraw. If there will be a change and the website will stop making such a fuss over 50$, I will gladly delete my review.</p>
<p>Lookout people.</p>
<p>7 Woche ohne Hilfe jeglicher Personen, immer nur bots die mir gleiche Antworten geben, nicht helfen geschweigedessen mich beschuldigen mehrere Accounts benutzt zu haben. Ich habe nur einen Account benutzt, gespielt, eingezahlt und versucht zu verifizieren.</p>
<p>scam auf Scam</p>
