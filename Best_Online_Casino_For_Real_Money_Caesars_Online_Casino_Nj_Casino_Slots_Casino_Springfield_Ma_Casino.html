<p>The award-winning iGaming provider offering innovative video slots, branded, instant and table games, Evoplay, announced a new content deal with Novibet (novibet.com).</p>

<p>The latest deal was announced Wednesday and sees Novibet integrate leading content from Evoplay. This includes the company’s 62 thrilling titles that are MGA-certified. As a result of the new collaboration, Evoplay will provide 10 entertainment-first instant games and 52 immersive video slots for the leading operator.</p>
<p>Thanks to this deal, Evoplay will enhance Novibet’s offering by adding new highly popular titles such as Fruit Super Nova 100, Penalty Shoot-Out and Elven Princesses. As a result of the new deal, those leading games are now available for Novibet’s Maltese and Irish platforms.</p>
<p>“We are happy to have Evoplay’s content integrated onto our platforms, as the studio has built a reputation for providing captivating content.“ Fotini Matthaiou, casino manager at Novibet</p>
<p>Novibet’s casino manager, Fotini Matthaiou, said that the company is excited to integrate Evoplay’s leading content within its platforms. He outlined that the leading iGaming developer is famous for its immersive and quality content. What’s more, Matthaiou said that offering the best products available is a key goal for Novibet. Last but not least, he acknowledged that the company’s goal is boosted by Evoplay’s high-quality casino and sports-themed games.</p>
<p>It was back in 2010 when Novibet first launched its services. Operating for more than a decade now, the company is a leading casino and sports betting operator in Europe. Currently, Novibet has a rich portfolio of content offering a betting platform, as well as more than 5,000 casino titles from leading developers.</p>
<p>The Company Is Delighted to Team Up with Novibet</p>
<p>Vladimir Malakchi, Evoplay’s CCO, said that the company is glad to join forces with Novibet for this new content deal. He pointed out that the new deal further expands Evoplay’s growing portfolio of partners. At the same time, Malakchi said that the collaboration helps expand the reach of Evoplay’s portfolio in strategic markets such as the one in Malta and Ireland. He explained that the company identified Ireland as a market with a high potential that has seen unstoppable growth this year.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to have signed an agreement with Novibet, a great addition to our ever-growing network of popular operator partners.“ Vladimir Malakchi, CCO at Evoplay</p>
<p>The latest deal comes after only recently, Evoplay expanded further its European footprint. The company inked a deal with Sportbet, the leading Italian-facing operator. The terms of the new deal saw the company roll out 65 titles for customers of the leading operator.</p>
