    <h1>Dreams Casino Login Cosmo Casino Casinos In Detroit Turtle Lake Casino Mgm Casino Ohio Viggoslots Ca</h1>

<p>Is Viggoslots.com the world champion in avoiding payouts? (or are they perhaps even criminal?)</p>
<p>I won 30 euros on Viggoslots using free spins and wanted to cash them out.</p>
<p>But when the usual payout time on Sunday had passed, I decided to play a little more.</p>
<p>In the process, I won a bit more and then requested two payouts: one of 50 euros and one of 40 euros. I thought that 100 would be allowed and that in the worst-case scenario, the excess would simply be deducted.</p>
<p>In the evening, when still no payout had been made, I went into a slot game with 10 euros that I had left in the casino account for about 1.5 hours. During this time, while playing for a few minutes, my total reached around 55 euros.</p>
<p>Exactly at that moment, Viggoslots decides to process my payout requests and confiscates both payouts on the grounds that I still have 50 euros in my account.</p>
<p>I went into the slot with 10 euros and came out with 0 euros.</p>
<p>Since I was playing the slot, I did not know how diligently the finance department at Viggoslots was working on a Sunday evening.</p>
<p>I wasn't previously aware that the current amount in the slot can be viewed live by the casino and can be considered as a balance before leaving the game.</p>
<p>Why would it have made sense to continue playing with 55 euros, if only 50 euros can be paid out?</p>
<p>I've been playing online casinos for 7 years now.</p>
<p>But, I hadnâ€™t even come close to experiencing something like this.</p>
<p>Over the past 6 months, I've deposited 160 euros there and had no payout.</p>
<p>I know it's only 50 euros.</p>
<p>But I feel like Viggoslots.com has pulled a con trick on me...</p>
<p>That's why I'm motivated to make the effort here.</p>
<p>The whole situation seems morally wrong to me. But,</p>
<p>Based on the circumstances, I'm struggling to fully comprehend it.</p>
<p>Regardless, this was a red flag for me to stop playing with the Gammix Limited Casino Group.</p>
<p>Those who resort to such methods are........well, never mind</p>
<p>What do you think about all this?</p>
