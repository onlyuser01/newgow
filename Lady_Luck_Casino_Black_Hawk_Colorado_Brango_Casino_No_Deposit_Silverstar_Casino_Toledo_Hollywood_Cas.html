    <h1>Lady Luck Casino Black Hawk Colorado Brango Casino No Deposit Silverstar Casino Toledo Hollywood Cas</h1>

<p>Hi. I tried to get a clear response from them regarding the specific rule I broke, but they only offered a general bonus abuse / 'collection of rules' and I don't know specifically which one I broke. The only one I can think of is the "Customer bonus ratio (deposits : bonuses) is more than 50%." rule but that's seems like a very arbitrary rule since technically all players who claim the first deposit offer of 100% break that rule. Here is the chat discussion I had with the casino:</p>
<p>Support Ninja 12:53</p>
<p>Hello. :) How may I help you?</p>
<p>Alex 12:53</p>
<p>Hi there. My email is: <strong><em>@</em></strong>.fi</p>
<p>You guys decided to confiscate my winnings after I won €2500 on my deposit of €300</p>
<p>I was supposed to receive an email with your 'official explanation' and my €300 deposit back.</p>
<p>Support Ninja 12:54</p>
<p>Hello Alex</p>
<p>Alex 12:54</p>
<p>It's now been 2 months and no email and the €300 deposit hasn't been returned.</p>
<p>Like I said, I'm going to publizice this ordeal on Casinoguru.com</p>
<p>I will there also include your 'email' - if you send it to me shortly.</p>
<p>Support Ninja 12:55</p>
<p>kindly provide us with a payment method to where would you like to get the 298.68 EUR?</p>
<p>Alex 12:56</p>
<p>What payment method do you offer? Straight to my IBAN bank account?</p>
<p>Support Ninja 12:56</p>
<p>http://casinoguru.com/ - already warned about you</p>
<p>and you were blocked on all Dama and N1 casino operators</p>
<p>Alex 12:57</p>
<p>Sure you can be blocked if you win money</p>
<p>But it's a completely another matter to confiscate winnings.</p>
<p>I also have accounts in good standing at other groups... so there goes that.</p>
<p>If I lose money, I don't charge back on my credit card.</p>
<p>Support Ninja 12:58</p>
<p>before playing in any casino it is your responsibility to read the rules if you are not satisfied with the conditions, then you are not obliged to register and play</p>
<p>Alex 12:58</p>
<p>It's a very simple matter. As many people need to know about your practices as possible, so they can chose where they gamble.</p>
<p>Support Ninja 12:58</p>
<p>you can provide us with your bank details and we will pay you</p>
<p>Alex 12:58</p>
<p>Sure. I followed every single rule.</p>
<p>You arbitrarily decided to confiscate the winnings. It's generally seen as fraudelent behavior by the caisno.</p>
<p>My bank account number is:</p>
<p>Support Ninja 13:01</p>
<p>Abusing a promotion means:</p>
<p>While playing with an active bonus, it is forbidden to engage in activities that give the player a clearly unfair advantage. Such activities include, but are not limited to, these: delaying game rounds in any game, including free spins and bonus features, to a later time when you have no wagering requirements;</p>
<p>leaving large bets on the table, for example in blackjack, and returning to the game after bonus wagering has been completed;</p>
<p>playing games with bonus money to build up in-game value, lose the bonus funds, and then cash out on the built-up value during real-money play;</p>
<p>using strategies that take advantage of any software bug or failure. Customer bonus ratio (deposits : bonuses) is more than 50%.</p>
<p>Alex 13:01</p>
<p>Can you confirm you've received the IBAN account number? The Account holder is Alexander ****</p>
<p>I only played slot games. I only played Pragmatic Play slot games</p>
<p>Support Ninja 13:03</p>
<p>No i'm not confirm, details were provided in an incorrect form</p>
<p>Alex 13:03</p>
<p>Dear ¨"Support Ninja" please inform the email address where to send the bank account details and in which Form you wish to receive it.</p>
<p>Support Ninja 13:03</p>
<p>support@casitsu.com</p>
<p>Alex 13:04</p>
<p>Customer bonus ratio (deposits : bonuses) is more than 50% is a BS rule obviously because the customer is basically violating that rule from the first deposit, so it's completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>Alex 13:04</p>
<p>There are 1000 casinos to chose from, so why ever take a risk with one that stiffs the player.</p>
<p>Support Ninja 13:05</p>
<p>no one obliges you to take a bonus, this option is at your discretion to use it or not, but if you take it, then follow the rules</p>
<p>but I see you are very well versed in this, apparently this is not the first time you have encountered this situation</p>
<p>Alex 13:06</p>
<p>How come Ninja Support person, that from over 200 casinos I played at, yours is the only one that confiscated the winnings? :D</p>
<p>It means you belong to a group of 0,05%. Congrats.</p>
