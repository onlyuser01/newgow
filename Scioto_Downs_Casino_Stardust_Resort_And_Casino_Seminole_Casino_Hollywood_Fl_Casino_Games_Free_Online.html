<p>Steve Wynn Drops Anchor in Monte Carlo in $215 Million Super Yacht</p>

<p>Sexual-misconduct-denying casino mogul Steve Wynn sailed his $215 million mega-yacht into Monte Carlo this week, where the world’s fabulously wealthy had gathered for a spot of who’s-got-the-biggest-boat-type one-upmanship.</p>

<p>This was the Monaco Yacht Show –- an event attended this year by celeb super-couple Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom –- and hosted by the enclave’s Prince Albert.</p>
<p>Wynn’s 302-foot boat, “Aquarius,” blew the competition out of the water –- at least in the marina, where it was the biggest on show.</p>
<p>But another — anchored further out on account of its humungousness — was giving Wynn a run for his money, according to reports.</p>
<p>All at Sea</p>
<p>The 361-foot “Jubilee” was commissioned in 2012 by the late emir of Qatar, Khalifa bin Hamad al-Thani, who died before its completion.</p>
<p>Jubilee features its own helipad, a spa, a beach club, and a pool complete with giant fish tank. It was described as the most expensive yacht in the world when it was put up for sale last year for $323 million and its current owner remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Wynn’s vessel also boasts a helipad, along with a beauty salon, a gym, a massage and therapy room, and a large pool with a glass bottom so that drinkers in the bar below can gaze up at swimmers.</p>
<p>Fourteen guests can be accommodated on board in seven suites, including six VIP-suites on the main deck and an owner’s suite on the upper deck.</p>
<p>It is not immediately clear if Wynn is trying to sell the boat or is merely showing it off. The 76-year-old billionaire has found himself with more time on his hands recently after his resignation as CEO and chairman of Wynn Resorts in the wake of a slew of allegations of sexual misconduct toward female employees.</p>
<p>Faced with suitability investigations in several jurisdictions, Wynn sold his equity in the company he founded in 2002 as his continued involvement became a potential threat to its gaming licenses.</p>
<p>Art Dealer Comeback</p>
<p>Since withdrawing from the casino industry, the man credited with reinventing Las Vegas has reinvented himself as an art dealer. The longtime collector of fine art is selling multimillion dollar artworks, including Picassos, Matisses and Warhols, via his website, sierrafineartllc.com.</p>
<p>Things got off to a bad start for Wynn’s new career. In May, the sale of Picasso’s Le Marin was pulled because the work sustained damage after being hit by a rogue paint roller while awaiting auction at Christies.</p>
