    <h1>Ojos Locos Sports Cantina Y Casino North Las Vegas Photos Jacks Casino Cleveland J7Bet Casino Horsho</h1>

<p>I decided to play at this casino and made a deposit of €85 without a bonus. After a couple of hours of playing, I managed to win some money and decided to withdraw €520 from the casino.</p>
<p>Shortly after my withdrawal request, I noticed that I should verify my account, so I provided them with the necessary documents (passport and a selfie with passport, proof of address, and bank card details). After submitting these documents, I realized that my passport was not accepted as a document because it expired last summer. This was indeed my mistake as I forgot about its expiration and I currently do not have a new passport as a replacement. I then went to their live chat for advice and received a response from their customer service agent that identity can also be confirmed with a driving license, which is also mentioned in CatCasino's terms of use as an approved method.</p>
<p>After this, I sent them a picture of my valid driving license. I assumed that the issue was now resolved until I noticed a while later that my driver's license had also been rejected. I went again to the live chat to ask about this and surprisingly received a response that a driving license cannot be accepted as a verification method from the country where I live (Finland). This sounded to me like a suspicious fabricated reason not to verify my account as I have never had problems with account verification using the same driving license at many other casinos where this document has been perfectly accepted for identity verification.</p>
<p>Upon further study of CatCasino's terms, it clearly states that a valid driving license is an acceptable document to verify identity. However, at this point I'm only getting replies from the customer service on live chat saying that it's illegal to use a driving license for identity verification, among other fabricated reasons. I have also sent them an email requesting visible proof stating that a driver's license cannot be used for identity verification for people living in Finland, but unfortunately, I'm not getting any response to my question via email.</p>
<p>Would you possibly be able to assist me with this issue?</p>
<p>I honestly feel at this moment that CatCasino does not have any intention to pay me my due winnings and they are coming up with false justifications for not being able to verify my account even though I have provided them with all the required documents.</p>
<p>Attached are some screenshots of conversations with their customer service agent on live chat. Unfortunately, I cannot include email discussions in the attachments as I'm not getting any response to the emails I have sent them.</p>
