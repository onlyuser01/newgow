<p>EveryMatrix, a prominent B2B iGaming platform and software company that aggregates content from leading suppliers, has announced that it is expanding its list of trusted partner studios with the addition of 7777 gaming.</p>
<p>This partnership will essentially see 7777 gaming’s own library of games integrated directly with CasinoEngine, a powerful aggregation platform that features thousands of games by leading developers in the industry. Thanks to this collaboration, 7777 gaming is confident that it will further strengthen its presence in Latin America, Africa, and Europe, among other markets.</p>
<p>7777 gaming brings a selection of high-quality products which will be integrated and introduced to various new partners. Commenting on this opportunity, EveryMatrix COO of Casino Engine Amund Stensland said that the company was very happy to collaborate with 7777 gaming.</p>
<p>He added that the company’s casino content was going to add true value to partner operators and strike home with players. "Our mutual commitment to high-quality casino games content across all channels will provide players with a unique gaming experience," Stensland concluded.</p>
<p>7777 gaming CCO Elena Shaterova was similarly excited to see the company’s portfolio integrated and added to EveryMatrix’s aggregation engine. She noted that 7777 gaming had years of experience developing outstanding products that were now going to bring value to EveryMatrix, operators, and players around the world.</p>
<p>Presently, CasinoEngine hosts more than 12,500 games from 250 leading content providers. It’s one of the biggest libraries of games for the iGaming sector. EveryMatrix has been expanding its own footprint in global markets over the past several months.</p>
<p>The company obtained a conditional supplier license from the Michigan Gaming Control Board in December. EveryMatrix similarly expanded with a number of gaming studios in November, adding both Stakelogic Live and 3 Oaks Gaming to its CasinoEngine platform.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix emerged from its financial year with a record performance for both the fourth quarter and the full-year results, marking it the best in the company’s 15 years in business.</p>
