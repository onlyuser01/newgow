<p>A potential bid from a consortium led by former F1 team owner Eddie Jordan is threatening to derail Aristocrat’s acquisition of Playtech, Sky News reported.</p>
<p>New Contestant</p>
<p>JKO Group, a company established to seek opportunities in the international gaming arena by former F1 team owner Eddie Jordan and former Scientific Games executive Keith O’Loughlin, emerged as a candidate to acquire the supplier of online gaming and sports betting software.</p>
<p>The group is said to be mulling an offer for Playtech that includes cash and contingent value rights based on Playtech’s stake in another company, a joint venture with Mexico-oriented gambling business Caliente Group. In a separate process, Caliente and Playtech are discussing a potential merger for their joint venture with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) to go public.</p>
<p>According to the report, JKO Group is negotiating with Centerbridge Partners, a US-based investor, to secure financing for the bid, while Global Leisure Partners, a merchant banking boutique firm, is said to be the consortium’s adviser.</p>
<p>The consortium is believed to have made a preliminary approach to Playtech’s advisers, but given the complexity in the structure of the bid, there is no certainty a firm bid for the London-listed supplier of online gaming and sports betting software will materialize.</p>
<p>The potential of another bid will certainly be good news to Playtech shareholders who are hoping that a takeover battle will further raise the price of their holdings at the company that boasts a market capitalization value of £2.2 billion ($2.97 billion).</p>
<p>Bidding War?</p>
<p>JKO Group is the third company showing interest to acquire Playtech, following the AU$5 billion ($3.7 billion) offer tabled by Australian-based manufacturer of gaming equipment Aristocrat Leisure, valuing the company at £6.80 ($9.35) per share, and the subsequent approach by Playtech’s second-largest shareholder, Gopher Investments, which is still to make a firm bid believed to be in the region of $4.07 billion.</p>
<p>Gopher is believed to hold the upper hand to Aristocrat as the Hong Kong-based investment firm is still finalizing the $250 million deal for Playtech’s financial arm Finalto, the completion of which is one of the conditions in the bid tabled by Aristocrat.</p>
<p>Any new bid by Gopher or the consortium led by Eddie Jordan should go at least 10% above the price Playtech already accepted from Aristocrat according to the terms of the Australian company’s offer, suggesting a minimum of £7.48 ($10.28) if a bid is to gain the Board’s recommendation.</p>
<p>Responding to the news of JKO Group’s approach, Aristocrat released a statement claiming that it continued to work with Playtech towards closing the transaction, moving along with the regulatory approval process.</p>
