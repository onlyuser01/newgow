    <h1>Oxford Casino Choctaw Casino Resort Durant Durant Ok Zia Park Casino Casinos In Montana Oceans Casin</h1>

<p>Thank you for your quick response and offer of help.</p>
<p>The best place to start is with the deposit I made on 2/7/2023 at 9:09:04 p.m. I was offered a second welcome bonus of 100% which I accepted. Before that, of course, I looked on the promotion page for the specific conditions and clicked the "Terms and Conditions" link and read everything through. Since everything was fine, I assumed in good faith that I wouldn't be allowed to run into an open knife. With a lot of luck and for me relatively high bets of 1-2 € and a big single profit of about 700 € I earned a total of 950 € which I wanted to pay out. So I gave my bank details. The software immediately prompted me to undergo the verification process. I also received confirmation via email that I had successfully completed this and would receive an answer as soon as employees have viewed my documents. This then took 2 1/2 days and I was confirmed that I was verified and my withdrawal request would now be processed. The next day I was informed: "Sorry, we had to decline your withdrawal as you breached our terms and conditions by playing restricted games while wagering the bonus."</p>
<p>How brazen can you actually be that you exclude the most popular games on offer when you take a bonus, that information is neither found on the promotion page nor after clicking on the link for the naturally applicable terms and conditions, but only after you have searched the entire website for further links has.</p>
<p>You have to scroll down for a long time to get this information.</p>
<p>The bad thing is that I have previously deposited in various other casinos in this group completely clueless and actually never had a real chance of winning because I violated the terms and conditions without knowing it and nobody said anything to me and only now after I had asked a lot I've lost money, I'm told that I could never have won. And I maintain that this scam and nothing else is, in my eyes, depriving a large number of players of their entire chances of winning. Losses and winnings of players who have deposited in good faith and in reliance on fairness at casinos in the Mountberg BV group are pocketed here. The vast majority of players just don't know it because they don't request a withdrawal because it's hard enough to even walk away with a profit.</p>
<p>In all casinos that I know otherwise, and there are quite a few, the player is not even given the opportunity to play a "forbidden" game because the software simply prevents it. It is also known that the casino arbitrarily excludes games or entire providers for playing with bonus money, but that this crucial information is intentionally hidden and the software is neglected in such a way that players are not prevented or warned of losing their chances of winning, which is not the case take. The casino has my complete data and I feel deeply violated in my human dignity and integrity by this casino. Now I know how it feels after being conned.</p>
