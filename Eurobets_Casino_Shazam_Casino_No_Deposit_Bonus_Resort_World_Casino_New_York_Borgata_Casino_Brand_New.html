    <h1>Eurobets Casino Shazam Casino No Deposit Bonus Resort World Casino New York Borgata Casino Brand New</h1>

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I registered at this casino around 3 weeks ago and won well. Initially deposited 200 and won around 6000 euros. I was then able to pay out 4,000 euros. Of course they were only canceled because the verification was outstanding. Everything verified and received the go-ahead from support for the payout. 4000 euros were then paid out and everything was approved and paid after 3 days. Great, I thought, everything worked so I continued gaming. This time I deposited around 1000 euros and then shortly before I was actually lucky and made 7000 euros out of it.</p>
<p>A good 5000 euros were paid out on October 3rd and since then the money has been in the pendulum phase. 10 days now! Catastrophe! Well I constantly write to VIP Support and I'm always put off! I should wait, everything will be processed and it will take time because of legal verification etcâ€¦ But everything is ok and I just have to wait.</p>
<p>But how long is it okay to wait? Especially since there are still 2,000 euros in my player account that I would like to have paid out, but I can't because the 5,000 haven't been processed yet. There is a limit of 5,000 euros per day that you can have paid out. But as long as these 5,000 euros are still in the pendulum phase, no further payment may be made. I have the feeling that they are delaying the payout for so long so that I can gamble away the 2,000 that I still have in the account. But I remain steadfast. At least for now...</p>
<p>who has similar experiences with this Cadino?</p>
