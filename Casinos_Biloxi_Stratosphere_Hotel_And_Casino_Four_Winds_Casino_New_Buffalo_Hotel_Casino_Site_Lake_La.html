    <h1>Casinos Biloxi Stratosphere Hotel And Casino Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Hotel Casino Site Lake La</h1>

<p>I took the Friday Reload Bonus in the Kosmonautcasino on Friday, December 17th, 2021. The bonus consists of two parts, a 50% reload bonus and 30 free spins. These are credited to the account separately. According to the bonus terms and conditions, the reload bonus has no maximum payout limit. With the free spins, the payout limit is set at € 200.</p>
<p>First I fully wagered the 50% reload bonus and requested a withdrawal of € 100 and left a small remaining amount in the account, a few minutes later I was able to withdraw € 50 again with the remaining money and a bit of luck.</p>
<p>Then I took the 30 free spins and successfully wagered the amount won from the free spins and had around € 280. These were automatically set to € 200 by the wager at the end (as described in the bonus conditions). I then paid out the € 200.</p>
<p>The next day I found that my first two withdrawals (€ 100 and € 50) had been canceled. When asked in the live chat, I was informed that I had received the maximum amount of € 200 from the free spins and that the remainder was forfeited according to the bonus conditions. After several attempts to explain that the first two payouts are not related to the free spins, I ended the chat. I also had the chat history sent to me by email, but unfortunately I did not receive it. Unfortunately, I didn't take any screenshots of it.</p>
<p>Summarized:</p>
<p>1) The 50% Friday Reload Bonus was wagered at around 02:15 am</p>
<p>2) The first payment of € 100 was made at 02:19 am</p>
<p>3) The second payment of € 50 was made at 02:24 a.m.</p>
<p>4) Free spins were taken at 02:26</p>
<p>5) Third payment of € 200 was made 02:42</p>
<p>Since the free spins were only taken after two withdrawals had already been made, it must be a mistake by the casino. I will attach screenshots with the relevant transactions.</p>
