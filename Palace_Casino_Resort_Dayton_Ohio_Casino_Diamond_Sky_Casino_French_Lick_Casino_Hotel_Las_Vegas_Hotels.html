<p>Top-tier gaming software developer iSoftBet known for blockbuster slots like Rambo, Moriarty Megaways, Brides of Dracula: Hold &amp; Win, Bewitched, and Lucky Clover has recently announced the expansion of its award-winning lineup with a new Hold &amp; Win game. The provider that is also known as a powerful content aggregator in the industry has released Colossus: Hold &amp; Win, an interesting game centered around an eye-catching ancient Greece theme.</p>
<p>iSoftBet Has Kicked 2022 With Another Staple Game</p>
<p>The company’s head of games Mark Claxton explained that iSoftBet wanted to start 2022 the same way it ended it, with a fresh Hold &amp; Win game featuring a world history theme. Last December, the provider released Lanterns &amp; Lions: Hold &amp; Win, an ancient Chinese-themed game featuring a temple with dancing lions and plenty of cool features. Earlier in January, the company launched Crabbin’ Crazy, another cool video slot following the same recipe for success.</p>
<p>The Magic Orb is another interesting Hold &amp; Win slot due to release on March 17. The game will include a variety of features and symbols like cascades, modifiers, free drops, and a particularly rewarding Hold and Win gameplay element that could score players a huge win.</p>
<p>Last December, the company chose Slotegrator to distribute its Hold &amp; Win and Megaways games as a means of reaching greater exposure in regulated markets iSoftBet’s Hold &amp; Win games are a true staple of their offering, hence why the provider wanted to give its loyal players another taste of what quality entertainment means through its new slot.</p>
<p>Colossus: Hold and Win Information</p>
<p>Players are carried into a mesmerizing place, right next to the Colossus of Rhodes, a statue dedicated to Helios, the god of the sun in Ancient Greek mythology. The statue that was about the height of the Statue of Liberty was destroyed during a massive earthquake. The game lets players admire the gorgeous creation together with other eye-catching ancient world elements.</p>
<p>Colossus features five reels, three rows and 20 paylines, along with several respins rounds and multiplier wilds for some lucrative payouts. The new video slot game lets players take their pick between a minimum bet of 0.20 and a maximum bet of 20. The high volatility game’s RTP is set at 96.00%, while the hit frequency is set at 37.2%. players could score as much as 26305X their bet.</p>
<p>Game Features</p>
<p>The most important and at the same time the most valuable symbol within the game is the Colossus Wild. The symbol will expand once it lands on a winning line and trigger a multiplier of up to 10x.</p>
<p>The Hold &amp; Win Respins can be triggered with at least six gold coins. Initially, a player will receive three respins. Then, the spins will automatically reset every time a minimum of one coin will land on the reels. The visible values will be paid out once the respins are over.</p>
<p>The Colossus Rising Flame will pop at the beginning of each new Hold &amp; Win Respins round, or whenever a new coin lands. In turn, this will cause a flare-up that will multiply the value of every coin on the screen by as much as 10x. This means players can expect to scoop up a juicy payout in the end.</p>
<p>Players who manage to fill up the grid with golden coins during the Hold &amp; Win respins will win a Colossus Spin on the special wheel. This will either engage the Colossus Award, the Minor, or the Major Awards, worth 10,000x, 50x, and 500x their bets.</p>
<p>The game also features multiplier wilds that will assist players with creating more winning combos by substituting missing symbols, except for coins. Once a multiplier wild lands, it will expand and cover the entire surface of the reel, while triggering multipliers ranging from 2X to 10X. The bonus buy feature allows players to pay 100x and instantly activate the bonus game. Colossus: Hold &amp; Win can be played on the go, as it is compatible with all types of mobile devices, including notepads.</p>
