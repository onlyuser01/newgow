<p>Featuring higher wins and a selection of excellent features meant to keep players on their toes during their fights against Loki on their way to conquer Asgard, the sequel to Play’n GO’s original slot has a lot to offer to fans of the genre.</p>
<p>The 2005-founded studio that won Game Studio of the Year at the CasinoBeats Game Developer Awards in May has brought a few significant improvements in different areas of the game while preserving the large 7×7 grid. We have reviewed the sequel released at the start of June and these are our findings.</p>

<p>A Game as Unpredictable as Loki’s Mischief</p>
<p>Loki has once again switched his allegiance and he is determined to rule the home of the gods. This means the latter will require some help from players who will need to gradually reveal the special game features and mechanics, collect cool wins, and support the fight against the deceiving, shape-shifting god.</p>
<p>Players who are ready to pick up the arms and fight this adrenaline-pumping battle to protect the realm of the gods will be backed by other captivating Norse god characters. The list includes Heimdall, Freya, Thor, and Odin.</p>
<p>Heimdall is the protector of the Bifröst and his precious loyalty makes him an important ally in the quest to keep Asgard safe from Loki. To further navigate the battlefield and keep pushing forward, players will also get help from Freya, the goddess of love, fertility, beauty, and, of course, war. Freya will use her divine grace and strength to help players go over all the obstacles coming their way and work on a winning strategy.</p>
<p>God of thunder Thor is also Loki’s blood-brother. He will be seen wielding his massive power and iconic hammer in the important battle, helping players keep Asgard and its dwellers safe. Finally, Asgard’s Allfather Odin and supreme ruler will use his wisdom to guide players’ steps and help them restore peace over the realm.</p>
<p>The chaos of Ragnarök and the numerous twists in the multi-feature, cascading grid title make the game just as unpredictable as the effect of the mechanics in it. To score wins, players must create the right combinations across the grid, then wait for the winning combo to vanish and make room for additional symbols to cascade and fall back into place and potentially attract new wins.</p>
<p>Spirit Wild, Loki’s Mischief, Gift of the Gods, Power of the Aesir &amp; Ragnarök Free Spin</p>
<p>The base game incorporates a series of special features such as the Spirit Wild that charges with every new winning combination, with the exception of those combinations resulting from cascades. When a player manages to grab at least four winning combinations in a row, they can unlock one of the four available gifts from the generous gods. These consist of various combinations of Wilds, which will automatically boost the odds of landing winning combinations.</p>
<p>Loki’s Mischief is a feature that can be triggered when there are no wins in a cascade or during a round, with Loki’s Mischief generating a cluster of five to eight Mystery symbols revealing a random symbol, with the exception of Wilds.</p>
<p>Once the Spirit Wild collector has grabbed a minimum of four Spirit Wilds, players will engage the Gift of the Gods feature. The latter will select a series of bonuses.</p>
<p>The game also features a Runic Charge Meter to the side of the grid that is automatically filled following players’ progress during the base game, adding one extra charge per symbol that creates a winning combination. Players can trigger the Power of the Aesir feature when the charge meter is filled with 35 symbol wins. The feature will then randomly pick a bonus.</p>
<p>Players who manage to fill the meter with 65 symbol wins trigger the Ragnarök Free Spin feature, during which the meter changes into a multiplier meter, and Power of the Aesir features are applied on all non-win cascades. During the same feature, up to 20 Spirit Wilds are gathered and added back to the grid at the end of the feature.</p>
<p>The company’s head of game retention George Olekszy expressed their thrill about expanding on a game that “has already captivated audiences across the globe,” calling Viking Runecraft Apocalypse a game with a well-chosen narrative that perfectly stands for their goals.</p>
<p>In April, the studio released Ronin’s Honour, a premium slot with a samurai theme in place and dynamic payways.</p>
