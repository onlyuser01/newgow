    <h1>Bingo Station Casino Mgm Casinos Las Vegas Casinos Vegas Morongo Casino Concerts Casino S Pizza Elys</h1>

<p>Elys Game Technology, a global gaming technology company, has made its intentions about the B2C sports betting market in the United States clear with the introduction of its new online and mobile sportsbook brand, SportBet dot com.</p>
<p>Still subject to regulatory approvals, the company hopes to enter multiple US jurisdictions and obtain important market partnerships and access to core states that have embraced sports betting.</p>
<p>Conservatively, the company expects this to happen in the last quarter of 2023, and the company already holds licenses in Washington DC, and the state of New Jersey. The official press release explains that the company is using its Elys America platform to bring local customers some of the best sports betting features and overall experience, although the brand’s URL still redirects to the company’s home page, ElysGame dot com.</p>
<p>Elys Game Technology Executive Chairman Michele Ciavarella has welcomed the opportunity to see the company’s new betting brand launch and further shore up the company’s North American presence, as part of the new Elys America business unit.</p>
<p>"SportBet.com is a clearly identifiable sports betting URL emphasizes our direction in the US and our goal to be recognized as a top-tier challenger in this expanding market," Ciavarella added. All of this is done to match the company’s core mission which is to deliver an unrivaled sports betting experience and do so while inspiring loyalty in players and conveying a message of reliability and trust.</p>
<p>The company also has retail presence with sportsbooks in Ohio, and Washington DC and it maintains a B2B division which focuses on supplying technology to interesting parties. However, at a time when brands such as Unikrn and Luckbox are scaling down their B2C presence, Elys feels more confident that the time to increase its presence in the business-to-customer segment has come. Elys is also a well-known name in Europe.</p>
<p>Elys also introduced its virtual sports products in Italy earlier this year, marking the company’s ambition to be present in lucrative and promising markets well across the globe.</p>
