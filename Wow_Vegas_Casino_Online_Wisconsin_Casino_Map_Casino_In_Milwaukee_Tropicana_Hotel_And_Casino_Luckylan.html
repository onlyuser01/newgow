<p>Mega Mine review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Mega Mine has a frontier mining theme.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves in the fresh air of the untamed wilderness beside a clear river. In the rocky terrain, they’ll discover a range of precious stones in tantalising hues.</p>
<p>This slot is a good pick for players who enjoy gem-themed or even Western-themed slots. The atmosphere has a clean, breathless sense of adventure about it that will make players feel ready to strike it rich.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack has an Old Western feel, blended with the splashes of a rushing river. This adds to the natural ambiance and makes players feel they are standing beside chilly water.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are packed with vivid gems from green emeralds to red rubies. Each one seems to be expertly cut to catch the light.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see an idyllic wilderness scene filled with mountains, blue sky, pine trees, and a clear river and waterwheel. The graphics quality is decent and brings to mind a children’s animated feature film.</p>
<p>Through the gameplay, players are also transported deep into a mine where mystic fog drifts and lanterns gently glow. The glint of gems also illuminates the darkness of the deep underground world.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and graphics combine to create a pleasant frontier mining world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Mega Mine is a five reel, four row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in at least three adjacent rows starting from the leftmost reel and going to the rightmost.</p>
<p>Players may opt to buy directly into the Free Spins feature (see further details below).</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols.</p>
<p>The Mystery Stacks will nudge into full view whenever they appear, revealing matching symbols. Mystery Stacks will show a value between 2 and 5, increasing by +1 for every row they nudge. The value shown when covering the reel corresponds to the number of symbols that each stack reveals.</p>
<p>Mystery Stacks may appear on any reel.</p>
