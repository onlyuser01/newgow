<p>IGT and Boyd Gaming have signed up a multi-year partnership under which Boyd will utilize IGT’s sports betting platform and self-serving wagering kiosks across Boyd’s Vegas properties.</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming and IGT Extend Partnership</p>
<p>On Wednesday, casino operator Boyd Gaming inked a new partnership with International Game Technology (IGT). The deal allows Boyd to benefit from IGT’s dedicated state-of-the-art sports betting technology.</p>
<p>The partnership extends to both Boyd’s retail sportsbooks in Nevada as well as the operator’s sports betting app as well as online wagering options. It has also positively affected IGT’s stock movement. As per the agreement, Boyd will tap into IGT’s dedicated PlaySports self-serving kiosks which will be located throughout the brand’s Las Vegas properties.</p>
<p>IGT and Boyd have refrained from providing financial data about the partnership, but said they will clarify on the roll-out of subsequent features in the near future. So far, Boyd operates 29 casinos in 10 states.</p>
<p>The company is still keeping three of its Las Vegas casinos closed since mid-March responding to the economic downturn brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic which forced commercial casinos in the United States to close en masse.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Boyd Gaming placed a request with the city of Henderson to change the status of the Eldorado Casino property to non-operational until at least 2021. Furthermore, Boyd will keep its Main Street Station and Eastside Cannery properties closed down, as visitations to Las Vegas have fallen.</p>
<p>The FanDuel Link Between the Companies</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming has been successful in diversifying its offer and currently operates a FanDuel sportsbook at seven of its land-based casinos. This includes a mobile sports betting app for its operations in Pennsylvania and Indiana and the company is now looking to launch an app in East Peoria, Illinois.</p>
<p>Choosing IGT as a partner aligns nicely with Boyd Gaming’s ties with FanDuel, which is also a trusted partner for IGT. Earlier in August, IGT and FanDuel signed a sports betting and iGaming partnership focusing on the United States and extending through September 2024.</p>
<p>FanDuel will benefit from IGT’s dedicated sports betting solutions in eight states whereas IGT will be able to expand into two markets with casino-style games launched by FanDuel, in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IGT and Boyd Gaming have stuck together since 2018 and have worked hard to establish themselves on the US market. According to IGT SVP for PlayDigital, Enrico Drago, omnichannel sports betting will help brands such as Boyd to enhance its presence in states such as Nevada and drive high-volume sports betting engagement.</p>
<p>Thanks to IGT’s software, Boyd will be able to provide a dedicated sports betting product that would help the company stand apart from the competition.</p>
