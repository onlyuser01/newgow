<p>Leading international digital media company that provides content for highly engaged audiences while connecting them to relevant advertisers XLMedia has sealed a new partnership deal with Newsweek, the popular news brand read by more than 50 million people in the US on a daily basis. According to the terms of the agreement, Newsweek will work together with XLMedia’s Sports Betting Dime brand, generating sports betting content while managing agreements with sportsbook operators on regulated markets.</p>
<p>XLMedia’s director of partnership Cody Darwick commented on the new deal, describing it as a chance to tap into Newsweek’s “massive national footprint” in the context of the expanded legalization of sports betting in the country. Darwick called the expansion a “valuable” one for both parties while expressing eagerness to begin the collaboration and start adding their “insightful” sports betting content to Newsweek’s top digital property.</p>
<p>XLMedia’s brands currently operate across multiple fields including gaming, personal finance, and sports. They effectively “reach passionate audiences” while building close between their brands and the interested communities through innovative processes, expert crews, and creative storytelling. The company takes great pride in the way it manages to reach “the right consumers with the right content at the right time”.</p>
<p>In October, XLMedia and Sportradar signed a new agreement according to which Sportradar would power XLMedia with sports data and solutions including a series of visualization tools such as trackers for live matches and widgets used for fan engagement.</p>
<p>Newsweek Ready for a Fresh Revenue Stream</p>
<p>Newsweek’s vice president of strategy Nalin Kaul also spoke about the deal with the media company giant, expressing interest in harnessing the way sports betting is becoming more mainstream and picking up steam.</p>
<p>Kaul explained Newsweek was prepared to “capture a new revenue stream” using the news partnership agreement, given XLMedia’s “superior ability” of monetizing an audience that is highly engaged with the help of partnerships like the one that the two parties have recently agreed to ink. The premier news magazine and online platform have been providing international readers with top-quality news, detailed analysis, and ideas regarding global matters, business, technology, politics, and culture in the past eight decades.</p>
<p>Newsweek is co-owned by the chief executive officer and president Dev Pragad and Johnathan Davis, who does not currently fill any operational position within the company. At the beginning of November, Newsweek’s global chief commercial and growth officer Kevin Gentzel announced Jason Webby as the new chief revenue officer.</p>
