    <h1>Hallmark Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Vegas X Org Casino Casino Miami Beach 7Th Street Casino Mill</h1>

<p>For numerous months, I have endured Months and months I’ve experienced the dishonest and ethical practices your company commits yet I’m always told that your gaming is fair and what ever lies you guys think of to encourage me to make additional deposits. Your games fuction differently when using your free spins than when you just make a deposit and aren’t under any withdraw restrictions. I’ve made several complaints to you, trust pilot and yet this behavior still continues. I’ve always felt as if my account is set on an auto lose mode and I fact it is when I make deposits. Your systematic manipulation makes it so you all can limit the amount of money we are winnings or at least me. I have videos playing how the game functions on a bonus and off a bonus not even playing .20 cents produces wins. That’s all I feel like I won on which is not why I come to your site and play and the fact that your system is set up that way is disgusting. I’m asking you to do the right thing and give me all of my deposits back or this will turn into a lawsuit. I have months of proof and well as reviews stating everything I knew your company was committing. I’m sure your gonna say it’s not possible to refund yet your casino is rigged and I’ll proceed with litigation. I’ll expose you guys every single place I can as well because I’m sure you have hired actors to play as your winners. I even at one point closed my account entirely because of this but I thought I was mistaken but now that I have video evidence it’s something different. repeated encounters with your company's unethical and dishonest practices. Despite being assured of fair gaming and enticed with deceptive tactics to make further deposits, I have observed distinct variations in gameplay between using free spins and making regular deposits without any withdrawal restrictions. Despite registering multiple complaints with your company and Trustpilot, this behavior persists. I have consistently felt that my account is programmed to consistently lose whenever I make deposits. Your systematic manipulation appears to be designed to restrict the amount of money I can win, if at all. I possess videos that clearly demonstrate the disparity in game performance during bonus rounds and regular play, with even insignificant wagers failing to produce any wins. This is not the experience I seek when visiting your site, and I find it appalling that your system is structured in such a manner. I implore you to rectify this situation by refunding all of my deposits; otherwise, I will be left with no choice but to pursue legal action. I have months' worth of evidence and reviews that substantiate the allegations against your company. While you may claim that refunds are not possible, I firmly assert that your casino is rigged, and I am prepared to proceed with litigation. Moreover, I will expose your nefarious activities across every available platform, as I suspect you have employed actors to portray fictitious winners. At one point, I even closed my account in disbelief, but now that I possess video evidence, I know that my initial suspicions were indeed accurate. They also retaliated against me for exposing them on trust pilot. I just want money back or come to an agreement this is outrageous t</p>
