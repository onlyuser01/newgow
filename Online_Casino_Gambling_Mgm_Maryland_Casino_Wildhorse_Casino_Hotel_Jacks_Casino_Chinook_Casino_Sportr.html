    <h1>Online Casino Gambling Mgm Maryland Casino Wildhorse Casino Hotel Jacks Casino Chinook Casino Sportr</h1>

<p>Sportradar has announced a new multi-year partnership with the Turkish Basketball Federation as the company seeks to expand its reach and the league seeks to benefit from its own data and Sportradar’s extensive network of partners.</p>
<p>Sportradar Focuses on Turkish Basketball for the First Time</p>
<p>This is also Sportradar’s first full-scale partnership with any basketball entity in Turkey. Sportradar of sport content partnerships EMEA Jan Pommer said:</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with the TBF to deliver advanced data, analytics, and technology solutions to further grow the sport of basketball in Turkey and drive new commercial opportunities by introducing Turkish basketball to a broader and more international audience. Sportradar of sport content partnerships EMEA Jan Pommer</p>
<p>Sportradar will carry on with the full-scale deployment of its products, including data collection and integrity services as guaranteed by the company’s Universal Fraud Detection System. The company has dedicated a fair bit of its resources to ensure that it can protect sports integrity around the globe while also leveraging data for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The company is also carrying on with the installation of the Synergy Automated Camera System, a solution that uses advanced AI video capturing technology, which will now be available at the 27 venues in Turkey that are affiliated with the Turkish Basketball Federation. Understandably, the partnership will also have a commercial angle as the company will seek to leverage the league’s data.</p>
<p>Sportradar will distribute the data it collects domestically but also to global markets. Sportradar will also collect data from both the first and tier competitions, including the Turkish Basketball First League and the Presidential Cup. This partnership will be active in the upcoming 2022-23 campaign and stretch through the 2024-25 season for the domestic rights, the official press release noted.</p>
<p>Opportunity for Turkish Basketball to Benefit from Tech</p>
<p>Turkish Basketball Federation CEO Hidayet Türkoğlu welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with the global data and betting technology firm and said that this was an important and necessary milestone for the league. He added:</p>
<p>By signing this agreement with Sportradar, we will have the opportunity to follow the developmental process of our teams and players by using the features of cutting-edge technology. Turkish Basketball Federation CEO Hidayet Türkoğlu</p>
<p>Türkoğlu is further confident that the tie-up with Sportradar will have a positive impact on Turkish basketball in general. Turkish basketball is now better for the fact that Sportradar will be providing its advanced technological solutions to make it better. Sportradar recently introduced the ORAKO sports betting solution and has been rapidly expanding globally, signing up with sports leagues and making changes to its executive lineup.</p>
