<p>Demi Gods III review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Where the first two Demi Gods slots riffed on the Ancient Greek pantheon, Demi Gods III looks further north for its inspiration to the equally popular realm of the Norse gods.</p>
<p>In place of Zeus and his Olympian crew, Demi Gods III offers up renderings of Odin, Frigg, Thor, Loki and Tyr to fill out reels rich with references to Norse myth and decorated with the flare that Spinomenal excel at when they pull their thumbs out.</p>
<p>The Norse gods are a rich seam for the dwarven miners of the slot world to work, it is always nice to see a company give them a slot to really shine in.</p>
<p>Top symbols are expanded to cover 3 lines on all reels</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>As with many of Spinomenal’s top end slots, the visuals are stunning. From gorgeous portraits of each of the gods on the reels, to the delicate silver work around the spin button, huge care has been poured into making the slot look good.</p>
<p>The music is suitably cinematic and lends a dramatic air to proceedings as well as being tailored to the various game modes.</p>
<p>The animations and sounds effects are both excellent and co-ordinated to immerse players fully in the world of Demi Gods III.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Demi Gods III is played on five reels with three rows and fifty win lines.</p>
<p>The high value symbols are all made up of three symbol high portraits, effectively meaning these symbols are always stacked three high. The other symbols also tend to be stacked but can come in stacks taller than three symbols.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>During the base game, multipliers of x2 or x3 can be randomly triggered.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature, but Demi Gods III still provides excellent variety and pacing using its progressive series of bonuses (details below).</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol. Hitting five Wilds on a winline pays out three hundred times the player's bet per line.</p>
<p>Three or more Bonus symbols trigger the Bonus game.</p>
<p>Free spins bonus map</p>
<p>The player is first taken to a map displaying the nine worlds of Norse mythology, starting with the frigid Niflheim and ending with the home of the gods: Asgard.</p>
<p>Each world offers a different setup and feature. For example, the first world the player unlocks (Niflheim) uses a five reel by four row setup. When the player hits a winning combination in Niflheim free spins, the winning symbols freeze in place and a respin is triggered. This continues until no new winning symbols land; at this point the winnings are calculated.</p>
<p>Other worlds feature Wild respins, guaranteed wins in every free spin, sticky wilds and much more. This adds a feeling of progression and variety to the game that many slots lack.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.20%, a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€500.00 per spin. That spread should cover all but the very smallest of stakes players.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a weak match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility in the slots we chose.</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable in Demi Gods 3 slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Demi Gods III is a beautiful slot with excellent gameplay and worlds of variety in its selection of bonus games.</p>
<p>However, the RTP is just above average and the volatility is too low to make it a divine match for our slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>If the volatility doesn’t bother you, there is plenty of other stuff in this slot to appeal to players.</p>
