    <h1>Betmgm Online Casino Kansas Star Casino Cash Casino Aria Resort Casino Pool Casinos In Aruba Bragg G</h1>

<p>Bragg GamingGroup has continued to march on across the regulated European market, showing no sign or intention of slowing down. Regulated markets have been the prime focus of the acclaimed supplier, which is now doubling down on its presence in Switzerland through a content tie-up with Pasino.ch, the online gaming platform of Casino Du Lac Meyrin SA.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based casino is one of the most prominent land-based operators in the Swiss gambling market, and its online arm is one of the fastest-growing iGaming websites in the country. Now, Bragg will bring a high-performing and exclusive games portfolio and help Pasino.ch continue to compete against other established brands while ensuring players enjoy the best quality of iGaming fun possible.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming has hailed this milestone to secure a partnership with one of the most prominent online and land-based venues, as Casino Du Lac Meyrin SA is owned by the French Group Partouche, which owns casino properties in Belgium, France, Switzerland, and Tunisia.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity Bragg Gaming Group Chief Operating Officer and President Lara Falzon said that the iGaming market in Switzerland is already showing great signs of growth and that the partnership would allow the company to significantly improve its standing in the region.</p>
<p>"The relationship is an important part of our growth strategy for 2023 which will see us further expand our global geographical reach with established names such as Groupe Partouche," Falzon said.</p>
<p>Pasino.ch Managing Director Rupert Ecker was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that Bragg brings around a powerful and impressive collection of games that sits very well with local players and is a great addition to the online casino platform the operator owns in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Ecker noted that staying competitive is a part of what operators such as Pasino.ch want to prioritize by ensuring that they have a constant stream of innovative and worthwhile content â€“ Bragg Gaming Group is capable of bringing this around. Bragg has been expanding elsewhere in Europe as well, including in Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom among other geolocations and local markets.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Switzerland has been seeing an influx of casino suppliers arriving on the market. Pragmatic Play recently struck a partnership with Swiss Casinos, one of the biggest operators in the market and a competitor to Pasino.ch.</p>
