<p>7777 gaming has reported a new major milestone with the company having its portfolio certified to operate in the Georgian market</p>
<p>This will grant 7777 gaming an outstanding reach in the country and also continue to add to the company’s ambition of expanding Eastward.</p>
<p>7777 is a global supplier of advanced content and this is the first time that the company has had the chance to enter the regulated Georgian market, which the developer has hailed as progressive and a significant milestone in its own global journey.</p>
<p>Embarking on a New Journey in Georgia</p>
<p>The company, which provides content to Balkan operators, and has been expanding outside of its stomping ground, has found many similarities between its stomping ground in Bulgaria and Romania on the one side and Georgia on the other.</p>
<p>7777 gaming hopes that it will attract and convert players for partner operators in the new market in Georgia, and also help boost retention rates for partner operators through the deployment of innovative and immersive titles. The supplier has some 100 games to bring to bear, which is an excellent opportunity for the company to present its capabilities to local operators.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity 7777 gaming CCO Elena Shaterova had this to say:</p>
<p>Following our years of experience in the Balkan markets, we have developed a great sense of understanding what the players want and enjoy in an online casino game. 7777 gaming CCO Elena Shaterova</p>
<p>Shaterova was similarly pleased to be entering the Georgian market, which has been long in 7777’s sights. She confirmed that the company would seek to differentiate its offer in the market and ensure that it wins players’ hearts and mind through the deployment of creative, innovative, and worthwhile content.</p>
<p>7777 gaming has been a lot in the news recently. The company launched its content with Bitcasino and Sportsbet, two of the world’s most innovative iGaming and casino brands that have a very strong focus on crypto gaming.</p>
<p>The company also joined 1×2 Network to further expand its reach and ensure that it can introduce its products to a larger audience. The company also doubled down on its reach through a partnership with EveryMatrix, and the company’s CasinoEngine solution.</p>
<p>The company similarly strengthened its executive lineup with the appointment of Mitko Mitev as its new chief executive officer in April.</p>
