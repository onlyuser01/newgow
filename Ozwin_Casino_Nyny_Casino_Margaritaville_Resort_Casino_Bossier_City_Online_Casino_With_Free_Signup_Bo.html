<p>The Independent Betting Adjudicating Service (IBAS), an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) service within the UK gambling industry adjudicating disputes between licensed gambling operators and their customers since 1998, is seeking to become the new Gambling Ombudsman.</p>
<p>‘Experience, Expertise and Commitment’</p>
<p>The ambitious plan to take the role of the new Gambling Ombudsman was revealed by the gambling specialist in a statement on its website today. It is widely anticipated that as part of the review of the Gambling Act the UK government will call for the creation of a new role to ensure a better level of protection for the consumers and push the industry to raise its standards.</p>
<p>IBAS managing director Richard Hayler pointed to the gambling specialist’s credentials in terms of “experience, expertise, and commitment to independent decisions” as key to its ambitions to become the new Ombudsman.</p>
<p>He then went on to “welcome the creation of a new Ombudsman” role, outlining the importance that the service is “run by an organization that understands the sector and has a track record of helping and protecting consumers.” To date, IBAS has resolved over 85,000 gambling disputes, Hayler added.</p>
<p>“An Ombudsman with additional resources, built on the foundations of IBAS is best placed to hit the ground running, protecting consumers, and raising industry standards through fair, consistent decision making and constructive dispute avoidance feedback.” Richard Hayler, Managing Director, IBAS</p>
<p>With nearly 25 years of experience in resolving gambling disputes, IBAS established itself as the leading gambling ADR service provider in the UK, dealing with more than 80% of the gambling complaints in the country, as well as overseas disputes.</p>
<p>Roadmap for the New Ombudsman</p>
<p>Arguing that it is the best candidate for the new role, IBAS proposed its roadmap which outlines three main points: the aims and a governance framework setting for the new Ombudsman’s remit, the need for new and compulsory funding from the industry that should not impact the impartiality of the Ombudsman while making gambling dispute decisions, and the need for a Fair Play Code with criteria for deciding complaints and the fairness of terms and conditions of operators, as well as complaints related to harmful gambling.</p>
<p>IBAS chairman Andrew Fraser outlined the exciting industry times ahead pointing to the “real opportunity to enhance the service” gambling customers receive via a new Ombudsman.</p>
<p>“IBAS has been committed to providing an accessible, fair, and independent service to all gambling consumers,” Fraser continued, stating that the gambling dispute specialist’s plan for a Gambling Ombudsman would provide a higher level of protection for consumers and avoid complaint backlogs, but most importantly, will offer “a solution that works for the Government, the regulator, and the industry.”</p>
