    <h1>Kewadin Casinos Casino San Bernardino Casino Nashua Nh Casinos Near Denver Colorado El Dorado Casino</h1>

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>Over the years, I have played at several casinos and, for the most part, everything has been fine. Back in December 2022, I stumbled upon queenvegas and have been playing on their site ever since - during which time I've consistently lost my deposits. In fact, I've never won anything there.</p>
<p>That is until a week ago when I finally won 14,000kr, which after a very lengthy process, was approved for withdrawal.</p>
<p>The withdrawal was made via Trustly directly to my bank account.</p>
<p>With other casinos, it usually takes 1 to a maximum of 2 days with Trustly.</p>
<p>Now, after 5 days, I still haven't received anything and Queenvegas is more or less unresponsive. When they do respond, their answers are unclear and non-helpful - they seem to avoid giving a straight answer.</p>
<p>I have sent them several emails with account statements, showing that I HAVE NOT received the funds. I've also attached these for you at Casino Guru.</p>
<p>But they do not react at all.</p>
<p>Would you kindly help me with the matter - I have this nagging feeling that they are trying to cheat me and they've never actually sent the funds to my account.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Nader</p>
