<p>Tom Dwan Has “Biggest Loss Ever” in Macau High-Stakes Cash Game</p>

<p>It wasn’t Dwan’s best day when he Tweeted he’d just had his “biggest loss ever” last week</p>
<p>No matter how great a player, no matter how experienced or savvy, it is very hard to beat another poker player who just has more money than you will likely ever see in your lifetime. Very rich people typically didn’t get that way by taking no chances or by not having any moxie, and now it appears that Internet poker legend and uber high-stakes live cash player Tom Dwan has found that out the hard way.</p>
<p>High Rolling Downward Trend</p>
<p>Dwan reported he left a cash game with the unfortunate title of “Biggest Loser” last week, and when we say “cash” game we mean well into the millions of dollars were being parlayed in the pots. For an extremely aggressive and “take no prisoners” player like Dwan, swings are as inevitable as for someone who’s bipolar who left their meds at home. Dwan himself reported via Tweet that his financial crash this week represents his “biggest loss ever.”</p>
<p>“In taiwan for the 1st time ever… Not leaving the airport tho. Maybe next trip. Had my biggest loss ever yesterday” Dwan Tweeted from his verified account. Ouch.</p>
<p>Word from a credible online poker site put Dwan’s online (Full Tilt) wins at about $70K for the past week or so, so it’s assumed the loss occurred at cash games in Macau, as he just landed there a few days prior to the stomach-churning Tweet. Apparently such a huge loss that Dwan himself could not bare to actually write out the numbers, but it would have to be more than $2 million to make the Tweet an accurate assessment, as it’s known that Dwan lost close to $2 million to Viktor “Isildur1” Blom back in 2009 when Blom was still fairly new to the online poker scene.</p>
<p>There are also rumors of land game cash pots that are reaching close to $4 million at these not-for-the-faint-of-heart Macau high-roller games, so who knows what crazy amount Dwan may actually have endured there.</p>
<p>Poker Star But No First Place Finish Yet</p>
<p>Dwan – known to millions before his real name was revealed by his online handle “Durrrr” – is a 27-year-old American poker pro who continues to dazzle in the highest-level online and cash games, including No Limit Holdem and Pot Limit Omaha, usually on Full Tilt where he continues as one of their most notorious and recognized Internet pros. His acumen at tournaments, both online and on land, have garnered him close to $1,900,000 in winnings, with his biggest cash to date being his second place finish in the World Series of Poker No Limit Holdem event in 2010 for $381,885. Interestingly, despite his steady and impressive cash record in tournaments, he has yet to take first in any of them.</p>
<p>Dwan was raised in Edison, New Jersey and attended Boston University as an English major before dropping out to play poker for a living, so we can safely assume that the Justin Timberlake character in the new film Runner Runner – where Timberlake plays an online poker player trying to pay his way through Princeton who eventually loses everything in what he believes is a swindle – is not based on the Dwan/Durrrr story.</p>
