<p>The Bally’s Corporation has made a sizeable donation to the International Center for Responsible Gaming (ICRG) with the latest contribution amounting to $600,000. The ICRG, which is headquartered in Massachusetts, has been a national champion of treating, preventing, and addressing gambling harm at a time when both sports betting and interactive gambling are picking legislative steam.</p>
<p>Helping Tackle the Issue of Problem Gambling in the US</p>
<p>Commenting on this contribution, Bally’s Interactive Robeson Reeves said that the company has a mission and responsibility to help prevent problem gambling in the general public and players. “We take our responsibility to educate the public seriously,” said Reeves.</p>
<p>The executive praised the efforts put down so far by the ICRG which has been committed to developing cutting-edge evidence-based research to help prevent gambling addiction among young adults. The ICRG has been developing a variety of tools to help tackle problem gambling by specifically tailoring it to the needs of those in need.</p>
<p>The ICRG has welcomed the $600,000 donation and said that the non-for-profit organization will channel the money into additional research so that it better understands what triggers young gamblers and how to help tackle disorder and addiction by studying its formative stages and early symptoms.</p>
<p>IRCG seeks to help members of the public and their families who have been impacted by gambling addiction. This is achieved through running scientific research that is then leveraged by stakeholders to improve diagnostic, intervention, treatment, and prevention, and is hoping to achieve a better and safer gambling industry for everyone.</p>
<p>ICRG is not expecting to carry out this on its own. The organization seeks to recruit academics who are willing to work on relevant research topics and who can prove that their work can be eligible for funding. The ICRG’s established track record in the industry makes it one of the most prominent research-driven organizations committed to fighting problem gambling in the United States.</p>
<p>An Industry-Wide Response to Problem Gambling</p>
<p>Bally’s hardly the only company that supports the ICRG. Other stakeholders have sent an unequivocal message regarding their own commitment to fight problem gambling and improving the industry’s understanding of the issue. Las Vegas Sands contributed $300,000 for the development of guides and tutorials for parents who suspect their children are showing signs of problem gambling.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts allocated another $250,000 to support further education and research on gambling disorders and responsible gambling Another company to donate was Caesars Entertainment, which coughed up $200,000 in May. Caesars made the donations through its Foundation.</p>
<p>The IRCG continues to drive important forays into problem gambling research, prevention, and treatment with stakeholders showing mounting commitment to the cause. More funds will be needed in light of expanding gambling legalization in the United States as well.</p>
