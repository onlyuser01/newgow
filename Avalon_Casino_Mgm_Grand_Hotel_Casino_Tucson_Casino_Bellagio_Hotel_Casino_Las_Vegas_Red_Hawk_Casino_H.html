    <h1>Avalon Casino Mgm Grand Hotel Casino Tucson Casino Bellagio Hotel Casino Las Vegas Red Hawk Casino H</h1>

<p>Steve Wynn, CEO and founder of casino operator Wynn Resorts, won a major victory as his opponent, famous #MeToo attorney Lisa Bloom failed to have the case dropped by the court and had to seek a settlement.</p>
<p>The lawsuit started all the way back in 2018 when Bloom issued a press release containing accusations of sexual misconduct from a former female employee of Wynn’s. Angelina Mullins, the alleged victim, claimed that the casino mogul ordered female performers to present themselves in a more sexually appealing manner whenever he attended rehearsals. Female actors had to strip down to their undergarments, freshen their makeup, and wear high-heels whenever he was present. The press release claimed that the former performer was paid $7.5 million to remain silent.</p>
<p>The Casino Mogul Managed to Defend His Name</p>
<p>Wynn asserted that all of these accusations are entirely baseless and that his legal team could prove it beyond doubt. As a result, the embattled billionaire launched a defamation lawsuit against Bloom and her law firm, The Bloom Firm, asking for a minimum of $75,000 in damages. The famous attorney tried multiple times to have the case dismissed but to no avail. According to the judicial panel of the appellate court, “Wynn has demonstrated a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Bloom Defendants acted with actual malice in publishing the Press Release.”</p>
<p>The two parties have since agreed to settle their dispute out of court. Wynn’s representatives stated that “Ms. Bloom will be issuing a public statement within five days of the dismissal of the action, which will acknowledge a retraction of the defamatory statement.” The settlement also includes an undisclosed sum to be paid by Bloom.</p>
<p>Wynn’s Legal Troubles Are Far from Over</p>
<p>Although this is a clear victory for the billionaire, this case is just one amidst a string of similar accusations, which led to him resigning from his company and selling off his entire stake in Wynn Resorts. This decision, however, was not enough to save the company, along with its new CEO, from the subsequent hefty fines and increased scrutiny.</p>
<p>The latest scandal forming around the former tycoon is a lawsuit by the US Justice Department regarding his alleged lobbying to have a Chinese asylum seeker deported. The complaint states that Wynn tried to influence the Trump administration on behalf of senior Chinese government officials in an attempt to protect his interests in the People’s Republic. “Steve Wynn has never acted as an agent of the Chinese government and had no obligation to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” stated the Mogul’s lawyers and confirmed that they will contest the lawsuit.</p>
