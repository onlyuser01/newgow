<p>Under the terms of the new deal, Powerball was named the Official Lottery Game of NASCAR. Moreover, the collaboration designated the lottery as an Official Partner of NASCAR, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>The latest partnership comes on the heels of the start of the 2023 NASCAR regular season. The season launched Sunday, February 19 with the 65th Annual DAYTONA 500, also famous as The Great American Race.</p>
<p>Celebrating the new partnership, NASCAR and Powerball announced the launch of a season-long promotion. Thanks to the new collaboration between the duo, the season-long promotion will run and culminate with the drawing of a winner of a $1 million-dollar prize.</p>
<p>What's known so far is that the draw for the $1 million prize is planned to be broadcasted live from the Phoenix Raceway during the NASCAR Championship Weekend set for November 3 through November 5. The duo vowed to share additional details such as the rules of the promotion, ways to enter and more on a later date.</p>
<p>Drew Svitko, the Product Group Chair of Powerball and Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Lottery, shared his excitement saying: "Powerball and NASCAR both have the extraordinary ability to create memorable moments that bring everyone together, to dream and cheer for something big." Finally, he explained: "Thatâ€™s why Powerball is proud to partner with NASCAR to bring extra excitement throughout the season, which includes awarding a $1 million prize to a player in Phoenix!"</p>
<p>Daryl Wolfe, NASCAR's Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, added: "NASCAR and Powerball have shared in the goal of providing exhilarating excitement for decades while also giving back to the communities in which we are a part of."</p>
<p>He explained that Powerball creates many millionaires every year. Finally, Wolfe said that NASCAR is looking forward to the unique experiences and opportunities the new partnership will deliver for fans around the country.</p>
<p>The new deal with NASCAR comes after only recently, the California Lottery confirmed the name of the winner of the staggering $2.04 billion jackpot.
