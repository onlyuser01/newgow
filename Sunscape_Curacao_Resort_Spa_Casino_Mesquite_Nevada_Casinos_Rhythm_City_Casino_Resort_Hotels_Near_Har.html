<p>This is a great opportunity for Amelco to see where it stand in terms of casino offering, Brandon Walker said</p>
<p>Amelco, a provider of sports betting, casino and lottery products and solutions, has rolled out its complete iGaming suite in New Jersey. The move will grow the company’s presence in the United States, allowing it to supply more operators with its solutions.</p>
<p>Amelco offers an in-house casino aggregation suite that incorporates slot games, table titles, poker and instant games. The company’s product offering is reinforced by third-party content from leading industry suppliers such as Evolution Gaming Group, IGT, Light &amp; Wonder and Pariplay, among many others.</p>
<p>Thanks to the launch, operators in the Garden State will also be able to tap into Amelco’s aggregation offering.</p>
<p>Besides boasting content from many tier-one studios, Amelco’s solution also provides the operator’s partners with customization and delivery via Amelco’s proprietary app. In addition to that, partners can use the built-in Bonus Engine to engage their customers with special bonuses and tournaments.</p>
<p>A Great Opportunity for Amelco</p>
<p>The company expressed its excitement to make a foray into New Jersey through Brandon Walker, head of Amelco USA. Walker noted that North America is one of the biggest online casino markets in the world, which is why the new expansion is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>Walker explained that the new launch will further solidify Amelco as one of the most established platforms in the USA. He hopes that the move will also grow the company’s reputation across the iGaming and sports betting sectors.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity for us to see where we stand in terms of our casino offering. Our award-winning sportsbook is already live across 15 states, so we are excited to showcase our solution in such a competitive environment. Brandon Walker, head of Amelco USA</p>
<p>Last month, Amelco also secured a launch in Ontario after receiving the go-ahead from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario. This was another major launch for the company, considering the growing prominence of Ontario’s iGaming and online betting market.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, on the other hand, Amelco went live in Ohio, becoming one of the state’s first suppliers. Operating across several continents, the company remains bullish on expanding its global footprint by supplying content to tier-one operators in major regulated markets.</p>
