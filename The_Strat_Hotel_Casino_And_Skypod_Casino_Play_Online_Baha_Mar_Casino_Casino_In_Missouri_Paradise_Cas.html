    <h1>The Strat Hotel Casino And Skypod Casino Play Online Baha Mar Casino Casino In Missouri Paradise Cas</h1>

<p>Leading iGaming supplier CT Interactive has signed a new agreement with NetBet Italy, agreeing to provide the prominent online operator with a selection of exciting online games. As a result, CT Interactive will expand its extensive presence in Europe, allowing more players to enjoy its titles.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, CT Interactive will inject some of its most popular titles into the operator’s portfolio. Games such as 20 Star Party, 40 Mega Slot and 40 Treasures are just some of the outstanding games that NetBet’s players in Italy will be able to try out.</p>
<p>The new games boast high-quality graphics, engaging experiences and exciting mechanics that reflect CT Interactive’s devotion to innovation. Italian players will thus get to enjoy hours of iGaming content at their fingertips.</p>
<p>The integration of CT Interactive’s award-winning games will reinforce NetBet Italy’s portfolio, allowing it to maintain its leadership position in Italy. Games from CT Interactive are already available on NetBet Italy’s official platform, allowing players to see what the fuss is all about. The deal was lauded as a major milestone for both companies.</p>
<p>NetBet Italy continues to enhance its lineup of games with new integrations from industry-leading suppliers. A few days ago, the operator also secured a suite of games from Inspired Entertainment, another major provider of online casino content. This followed an earlier integration of content from Wazdan, a famous slots developer.</p>
<p>NetBet Italy Is Sure Players Will Love the New Games</p>
<p>The deal with CT Interactive is in line with NetBet Italy’s goal to remain a local powerhouse. The operator’s PR manager, Claudia Georgevici, spoke on behalf of the company, sharing her team’s excitement about the new partnership.</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with CT Interactive and bring their outstanding games to our players in Italy. Their expertise and commitment to delivering exceptional gaming experiences align perfectly with our own values. Claudia Georgevici, PR manager, NetBet</p>
<p>Georgevici added that she is certain Italian players will enjoy the latest addition of games to NetBet’s portfolio.</p>
<p>In the meantime, CT Interactive continues to go from strength to strength, demonstrating the qualities of its product. The company’s success is attested to by its multiple partnership agreements with notable iGaming companies all over Europe.</p>
<p>Some of the latest operators to tap into the operator’s portfolio of over 200 games include Jackpot.ch in Switzerland, BetFlag in Croatia and Allwyn International.</p>
