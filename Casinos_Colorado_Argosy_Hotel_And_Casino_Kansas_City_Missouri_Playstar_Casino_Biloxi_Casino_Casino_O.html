<p>Hi Kristina thank you so much for getting back to me! I really appreciate you taking the time to help my situation. I will answer your questions in order asked.</p>
<p>1). After tellong them i had won they asked me what platform? I said Panda master. Then they said "$2000 ? Send me screen shot." I sent screen shot. Their response was "we are getting warning from your account. Its showing in our system that you are used 3rd party system to hack our game." And then i was immediately blocked. 2) Yes i had sent $40. In at that particular time and had no bonus. I got it up to $173 and then won $2000 on a $5 bet. My credit was $2173 still in the machine at the time i was blocked. I have the pic of the screen before it closed out. I have never been on any 3rd party they are lying. They immediately blocked My husband too and everyone else i had referred. (The day prior i had won $720 on a $7.20 bet on a 10xs pay machine because i got 2 of the 10xs symbols and a cherrie but they convinced me that the 10xs symbols dont pay unless there is all 3 on the line whicn isnt true either. They paid me $72.00 instead of $720.00)</p>
<p>3) I accumulated the whole amount of $2173 from a deposit i made to them there was no bonus's involved.</p>
<p>I have a 2nd facebook account that i have sent messages to them begging them not to rip me off. Explaining that i have drained my accounts inorder to win back some of my losses because it was my bill money that i lost. And even offered them to keep $500 as a tip. But those messages remain unread. Please help me i am just sick about this whole situation.</p>
