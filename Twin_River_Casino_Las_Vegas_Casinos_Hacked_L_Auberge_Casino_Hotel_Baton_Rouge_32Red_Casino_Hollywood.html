    <h1>Twin River Casino Las Vegas Casinos Hacked L Auberge Casino Hotel Baton Rouge 32Red Casino Hollywood</h1>

<p>Esports betting platform GG.Bet will continue to cooperate with the PGL, a leading esports tournament host and organization. The new exclusive deal will see the two companies collaborate on new formats and expand their footprint in the world of competitive gaming.</p>
<p>GG.Bet is well-poised to do that as it’s a fully endemic esports platform that has a strong focus on electronic sports wagering. PGL is responsible for some of the most prominent Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive competitive events, featuring six and often seven-figure prize pools.</p>
<p>GG.Bet and PGL Continue to Work for Better Esports</p>
<p>The new partnership comes ahead of the PGL Regional Major Rankings events that will take place between April 11 and April 24 and will be followed by the PGL Royal Antwerp event next month. GG.Bet will assist PGL with the broadcasting and distribution of the events and ensure that the tournaments reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks to GG.Bet, people who are keen to get the inside scoop of the events will be able to do so. GG.Bet will focus on the delivery of in-play data feeds that will bolster the experience and offer audiences live odds in real-time. GG.Bet will also feature bonuses for each stage of the competition, looking for opportunities to get more people interested in the esports betting side of the tournament.</p>
<p>The company is running its 10% no deposit cashback bonus through April 10 to mark the continuing collaboration between the prominent event host and the esports sportsbook. Commenting on these developments, GG.Bet COO Dmitry Voshkarin said:</p>
<p>“We are glad to be kicking off the new 2022 season with our partners PGL by our side for this important CS: GO major.” GG.Bet COO Dmitry Voshkarin</p>
<p>Voshkarin spoke about the opportunity to be teaming up with the platform in this renewed format and bring back offline competitions to fans. Esports too had to take a prolonged break from in-person formats which impinged on profitability and generally saw interest wane a little.</p>
<p>Executives Happy to Be Working Together</p>
<p>“We are proud to be continuing to work with PGL as their exclusive betting partner and to be involved in the organization of yet another thrilling tournament,” the executive added.</p>
<p>PGL CEO Silviu Stroie was equally pleased with the opportunity to be working with GG.Bet, a trusted partner who took esports as seriously as PGL did. He further explained:</p>
<p>“With GG.BET by our side, we are once again bringing fans to venues in their droves to enjoy edge-of-your-seat clashes between the world’s greatest teams. We are delighted we can continue to create esports history together.” PGL CEO Silviu Stroie</p>
<p>Esports and esports betting is big. Esports Entertainment Group has just launched its full and dedicated Vie.gg platform in New Jersey. Wagering on electronic sports is slowly gathering momentum in the US as well.</p>
