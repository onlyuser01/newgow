<p>Anne Arundel County police said Ronald Dalisay, 44, of Ellicott City, cashed the fraudulent vouchers in separate incidents over the past several weeks. They were for anywhere from $2,500 to $3,000, the Baltimore Sun reported.</p>
<p>Dalisay was charged with five counts of theft and a single count of felony theft scheme, the report adds. His case will be heard in local courts.</p>
<p>Live! Casino &amp; Hotel has more than 200 table games and some 4,000 slot machines. It also features two high-limit rooms, and an outdoor gaming area.</p>
<p>GGR for Maryland Casinos</p>
<p>In August, Maryland’s six casinos collectively reported gross gaming revenue (GGR) of $154.3 million, a 5.4 percent year-over-year increase. MGM National Harbor led the way, with roughly 40 percent of the market with win at $62.4 million.</p>
<p>In September, National Harbor reported GGR of more than $57.7 million, a six percent year-over-year premium. The MGM integrated casino resort has reported only two year-over-year monthly GGR declines during 2019 (May and June).</p>
<p>Year to date, National Harbor has won $295.5 million on its 3,139 slot machines, and $235 million on its 204 table games. That’s a roughly $16.3 million surplus on the same nine months in 2018.</p>
<p>In contrast, Live! won a little more than $53 million in August, a 12.7 percent premium. But Live! saw GGR head in the wrong direction last month. September casino win came in at $47.7 million, a 5.1 percent drop.</p>
<p>Horseshoe Baltimore was a distant third at $18.2 million in August. That monthly total was the property’s lowest GGR number in its five-year history. Last month, GGR at Horseshoe totaled $18.56 million. That is a 10.1 percent decline when compared with September 2018.</p>
<p>Overall, in September, casino win for the six gaming venues totaled $142.2 million. That represents a 1.1 percent loss.</p>
<p>Gambling Law Changes</p>
<p>As of this month, under Senate Bill 842, Maryland also decriminalized wagering and gambling, and it is now a civil offense, according to the MarylandReporter.com. Earlier, those convicted on illegal betting faced sentences of up to one year in prison or up to a $1,000 fine.</p>
<p>Maryland continues to ban sports betting in the state. To allow wagering on athletic events, the state will need to amend its constitution.</p>
<p>Given the extensive process involved, the earliest the state could implement legal sports betting is 2021, according to The Washington Post. A public referendum will need to be held for the law to be changed.</p>
<p>Miami Casino Arrests</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Miccosukee Resort &amp; Gaming property in Miami was the site of a fake voucher operation that ran over several years. Arrests were made earlier this year.</p>
<p>Miami federal prosecutors say gaming terminals were tampered with by four employees and four co-conspirators to generate illicit credit vouchers that were then exchanged for cash either from casino ATMs, casino cashiers, or the casino treasury.</p>
<p>Prosecutors claim four of the defendants embezzled more than $5 million from the Miami casino. Their cases will be heard in Florida federal court.</p>
<p>A 63-count indictment against the eight was filed in July by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida. The case was unsealed in August.</p>
<p>Charges against the defendants include: computer fraud, embezzlement and money laundering. The illegal operation began in 2011 and continued until 2015, prosecutors claim.</p>
