    <h1>Atlantic City Nj Casinos Casinos In Omaha Nebraska Atlantic City Boardwalk Casinos Map Of Biloxi Cas</h1>

<p>My experience here is a very mixed one, mostly leaning on the negative.</p>
<p>I have made a large number of deposits on RoySpins. Unfortunately it is impossible to tell you how many, and how big my accumulated losses are, as the transaction calendar on the website is always empty and does not work. I find it quite shady that you are not able to view your total losses, wins, deposits, withdrawals et cetera.</p>
<p>When asked to relay this information to me, the customer support agent told me they are not able to give me this information. They further went on to tell me where to fetch this myself, but as I earlier mentioned, the calendar on the website does not work to the slightest. (They told me the basic 'clear your cache, try another device etc bullcrap, but that obviously does nothing, as the problem is on their side - this has been mentioned by other people on the forums as well) Also; the customer support won't relay you much information. They won't tell you the email address of the VIP department, they do not know how much cashback you are getting (as it is automatically calculated by the system - super suspicious), etc. Information is not conveyed here in the slightest.</p>
<p>The lack of a working transaction log is but one of the deficiencies of the interface; especially if I am winning (very rare, but happens), I get constantly kicked out. One moment in particular I found very shady was when I was constantly getting kicked out of games and the website and told I was using a wrong password (when I definitely was not).</p>
<p>The Finnish translation is really bad, and the site would probably be better off without it.</p>
<p>The RTP tends to be pretty poor; if you manage to win, the slots make sure to suck you dry faster than you could ever imagine. Their explanations of RNG seem like a futile effort to hide that something is very off here; I have never experienced quite such bad luck in any casino I have played at. I would like to highlight how much at a loss I am here but sadly can not, due to aforementioned reasons.</p>
<p>I have received a few loyalty bonuses but they went down to drain very, very quickly.</p>
<p>What they have here is a moderate selection of games - unfortunately they lack such classic providers as for example GAMOMAT. They do have your standard PlaynGo and Pragmatic games, with a fairly standard selection of live games. Nothing off here, except probably the RTP, which I feel very iffy about.</p>
<p>They are, after all, licensed in Curacao, and people know this is not the license to be trusted. Curacao licenses tend to be very unregulated, and I would in all cases opt for the better, more liked MGA, that enforces strict rules. Even an Estonian license is more trustworthy.</p>
<p>As someone mentioned in a review as well, the cashback is laughable. I had at least 900 euros in losses a certain week and received 25 euros as a cashback. How ridiculous is that? I can not wait how grandiose a cashback they are going to cook up for my weekly losses of almost 2000 euros. (The 25 euros went down the drain in a couple of minutes, with free spins features giving whopping winnings of 2x, as is the norm on RoySpins)</p>
<p>Regarding the cashback - there is no real transparency. They can give you whatever amount, as customer support tells you it is 'calculated automatically', and refuses to tell you how. As with this, there is no real transparency with anything else either. It is just quite shady.</p>
<p>To their credit, the KYC is very well done with a technique I would hope to become industry standard. They use an automated system that quick checks your documents almost instantly when you register. After the check up you are good to go. For this, I have high praise.</p>
<p>Their withdrawals are generally quick and free of hassle, however, with the lack of proper responsible gaming options (you can self exclude for a maximum of 7 days but that's it - no loss limits or anything of the like), the fact you can initiate only one withdrawal a day is very predatory.</p>
<p>I have often encountered problems with deposits; either having to wait or the website directing me to the wrong payment method.</p>
<p>I really can not recommend this one, despite the hassle-free withdrawals.</p>
<p>All of it seems quite predatory; the lack of responsible gaming options paired with the fact that only one withdrawal can be initiated per day make it one of the unsafest casinos I have witnessed.</p>
<p>I also can not wait how they are trying to damage control everything I have said in an answer below my review.</p>
<p>Probably safe to steer clear of this one.</p>
