<p>FSB has become the latest supplier that is entering Ontario, Canada as a fully-regulated provider of iGaming products. The company will be able to deliver its products to interested private operators who are also licensed to run business in the province as per its new license issued by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario.</p>
<p>FSB Joins the Ontario Gaming Market</p>
<p>The company is authorized to operate as a Gaming Related Supplier License entity which will mean that FSB is ready to go live with its products as soon as the market opens for business on April 4. Commenting on this success, FSB CEO Dave McDowell welcome the news and argued that it would help with the company’s building momentum in the North American region.</p>
<p>“The pre-market opening approval from the AGCO pays a huge tribute to the quality of our technology, services and people as we push forward in global regulated markets in 2022.” FSB CEO Dave McDowell</p>
<p>FSB is not the only company to break ground in the Ontario gaming market, with a slew of operators, suppliers, and developers making a move in what is expected to be the busiest and most lucrative iGaming province. Boyd Gaming agreed to acquire Pala Interactive for $170 million to enter Ontario.</p>
<p>The province has already taken measures to ensure that responsible gambling will be front and center in the iGaming market. Light &amp; Wonder, another iGaming and mobile gaming giant, announced that it received a license from the commission and will be launching as well.</p>
<p>The Supplier Is Happy to Make Entry into Ontario</p>
<p>FSB VP of operations North America Bob Akeret welcomed the opportunity to be joining the Ontario market through this certification. He added:</p>
<p>“Being licensed as a Gaming Related Supplier as the market opens puts us in a strong position to play a leading role in Ontario, and build further and faster on the major growth we have achieved in North America over the last 12 months. This is an opportunity we look forward to embracing.” FSB VP of operations North America Bob Akeret</p>
<p>More of the big iGaming and gambling names have already submitted their license applications and received approval. Among them are Kambi Group and 888 Holdings.</p>
