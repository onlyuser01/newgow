<p>Scientific Games continues to pursue an aggressive expansion strategy, bringing top-notch industry veterans on board to help the company spearhead its strategy. As a result, SG has appointed Jim Bombassei as SVP of investor relations and added Simon Johnson who will now take care of the company’s operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>Simon Johnson Steps in as SVP for EMEA</p>
<p>Scientific Games has chosen Johnson to spearhead the company’s strategy in EMEA as SVP and managing director for the region. Johnson, who is a four-year veteran in Scientific Games, will analyze potential growth opportunities and try to advance the company’s strategy.</p>
<p>Johnson previously served as UK commercial director where he was in charge of sales, product management, marketing and business intelligence. His stint was a success, leading to new revenue opportunities and outreach to numerous jurisdictions, benefiting the company across the board.</p>
<p>As a well-seasoned individual and part of the Scientific Games lineup, the company is confident that he can now bring those skills to assist SG’s growth in EMEA. Johnson will be expected to “define and execute complex change programs, build and develop high-performing teams and work with boards to deliver growth and operational enhancements.”</p>
<p>Jim Bombassei Takes Investor Relations Lead</p>
<p>Apart from Johnson’s appointment, Scientific Games is tapping Jim Bombassei who steps in as SVP of investor relations, a role he will hold in both SG as well as the company’s free-to-play gaming subsidiary, SciPlay Corporation.</p>
<p>Bombassei has been tapped for his investor relationships and corporate finance experience. In his new position, he will be in charge of managing relations and work closely with the company’s investors and interested parties. He will also act as an advisor to the executive team.</p>
<p>SG chief financial officer Mike Eklund said that he was excited to have Bombassei step in as part of the financial leadership team. Eklund sees Bombassei’s addition as beneficial to Scientific Games, SciPlay and the company’s investor community.</p>
<p>For his part, Bombassei was equally excited to be stepping in this new position, arguing that Scientific Games has been able to tailor its product offering in a way that fits customer preferences today.</p>
<p>“There’s a huge opportunity ahead for both Scientific Games and SciPlay to innovate for the future and continue to lead the industry across all platforms, including land-based and digital, sports betting and mobile gaming,” the executive added.</p>
