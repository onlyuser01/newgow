<p>The incident led to the arrest of Brandon L. Pearsall-McNealy, 28, of East Stroudsburg, Pa. on several charges, according to LehighValleyLive.com, a regional online news site based in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Originally, the victim and robber met on the casino floor at the Pennsylvania gaming property and planned a drug deal for the parking lot. When Pearsall-McNealy and the victim went to the casino’s parking lot, Pearsall-McNealy pointed a firearm at the victim, police said. He then stole the money and drugs.</p>
<p>During the robbery, he allegedly threatened the victim, saying that he would “blow” his “head off,” the report adds, citing court documents.</p>
<p>Suspect Arrested</p>
<p>The suspect then sped away in a Ford. But casino surveillance cameras were able to capture the car’s license plate. The owner later told police Pearsall-McNealy often drives the vehicle.</p>
<p>The car’s owner gave the cops a phone number for the suspect. It was the same number he had given the victim while on the casino floor, police said.</p>
<p>Pearsall-McNealy contacted Bethlehem police and confessed to much of the incident. The victim also recognized Pearsall-McNealy in a photographic lineup, the report adds.</p>
<p>Pearsall-McNealy was charged with robbery, possession of a firearm, possession of a weapon, simple assault, theft, receiving stolen property, terroristic threats, and driving on a suspended license, according to LehighValleyLive.com.</p>
<p>On Monday, Pearsall-McNealy was arraigned before Northampton County Magisterial District Judge Patricia Broscius. He is being held later in the week in the Northampton County Prison in lieu of $100,000 bail. He is scheduled to next appear in court on July 13.</p>
<p>State Cop Bit By Casino Suspect in April</p>
<p>In April, a 68-year-old casino-goer allegedly bit a state trooper’s hand at Wind Creek Bethlehem during her arrest.</p>
<p>The suspect, identified as Rui Y. Li, also allegedly spit throughout the trooper’s office in the gaming property.</p>
<p>Earlier, she allegedly hit a female casino security officer several times. It was then that the trooper intervened and attempted to place handcuffs on Li. But Li resisted.</p>
<p>Prison Sentence for Robbery of Elderly Woman</p>
<p>In January, a Bethlehem, Pa. man was sentenced to at least 12 years in state prison for the kidnapping and robbery of a slots-playing senior citizen. Hykeem Sessoms, 39, stole just $7 after terrorizing his victim, an 84-year-old woman.</p>
<p>In December 2019, Sessoms, 39, followed the woman out of the Wind Creek Casino in Bethlehem. Sessoms watched his victim win and cash out a sum of money before tailing her to the third floor of the parking garage.</p>
<p>As she approached her car, Sessoms allegedly attacked her from behind. He said he had a gun and would kill her unless she gave him money.</p>
