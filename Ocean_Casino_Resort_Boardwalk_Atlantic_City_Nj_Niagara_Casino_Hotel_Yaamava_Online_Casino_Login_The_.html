    <h1>Ocean Casino Resort Boardwalk Atlantic City Nj Niagara Casino Hotel Yaamava Online Casino Login The</h1>

<p>We don't understand the problem, here.</p>
<p>The player uploaded his documents on the 26th of April. The selfie + ID were unreadable. Literally. We are required to have a readable proof of ownership of the lawful ID document. This is a KYC requirement and cannot be handled lightly. We frankly don't care how lax other casinos handle this process.</p>
<p>On the 27th of April, less than 24 hours later at 09:00, the player uploaded new selfie + id documentation. Readable. It was approved and the player fully verified at 15:18 on that same day.</p>
<p>Payment was processed on the same day, one minute later.</p>
<p>The player was verified and paid out within 24 hours of his request!</p>
<p>In return the player opens up a complaint AND writes a bad review on our Casino Guru page, with complaints about things that did not happen to him. He writes that we take up to 2 weeks to verify an account. POTENTIALLY. The player was verified within 24 hours at 15:18 on April 27th. The player was paid out one minute later, at 15:19 on April 27th. (UTC Time)!</p>
<p>His interaction with our support team was less than fortunate. He complains about the potential 14 days verification time. He is told by support, that it won't take that long if his documents are in order. He proceeds to threaten with bad publicity on askgamblers and casino guru. We have the screenshots and transcripts available, if needed.</p>
<p>One particularly "nice" interaction with this player, was when he was not happy with the POTENTIAL wait time for verification. Instead of arguing with the player, our support simply refered back to our terms and conditions. Admittedly, this could have been done in a slightly more forthcoming manner. But at this point the player was accusing us of being scammers. His next text to our support was, I quote: "Do u prefer to make the complaint using askgamblers or casino guru?"</p>
<p>This is not appropriate conduct for a player who has been verified and paid out within 24 hours of his request.</p>
