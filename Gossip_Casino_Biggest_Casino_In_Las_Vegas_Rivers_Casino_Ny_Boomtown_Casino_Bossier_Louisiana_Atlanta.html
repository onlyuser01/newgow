<p>The leading provider of quality games for the online gambling sector, Yggdrasil, continues to expand its European footprint. Earlier this week, the company announced a new collaboration with Casino Lugano, bolstering its presence in Switzerland. The latest collaboration will see Casino Lugano and its online brand, Swiss4Win, gain access to engaging games provided by Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>As a result, players of the brand and the popular operator will gain access to recent hits like Fatzâ€™s Diner GigaBlox and Vampire Riches DoubleMax. Additionally, customers in Switzerland will benefit from high-performing and popular slot games, including Valey of the Gods and Vikings go Berzerk. Overall, Swiss4Win's clients will access more than 50 of Yggdrasil's popular and quality games.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration comes after Yggdrasil secured an ISO/IEC 27001 certification which is one of the requirements for iGaming content providers in Switzerland. Teaming up with Swiss4Win further propels the iGaming provider's presence in the European country. At the same time, the partnership strengthens Casino Lugano's offering.</p>
<p>Paolo Sanvido, Casino Lugano's Chief Executive Officer, was delighted about the freshly minted partnership with Yggdrasil. In a statement, he explained: "Yggdrasil is a leading supplier with a vast offering of games that have proven popular with players all over the world for a decade now, so we are thrilled to launch them on our Swiss4Win casino and significantly strengthen our offering."</p>
<p>James Curwen, Yggdrasil's Chief Executive Officer, was similarly thrilled about the new content deal. "Partnering with Casino Lugano is a fantastic achievement for us as we continue to expand in Switzerland," he added. Finally, Curwen pointed out: "Our games resonate well with players in the country and this deal with another leading operator is testament to the popularity of our diverse portfolio."</p>
<p>The new deal with Casino Lugano and its Swiss4Win brand further complements Yggdrasil's strategic expansion plan. The collaboration represents the iGaming provider's third partnership for the regulated Swiss gambling market and expands its footprint on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil confirmed that it anticipates further growth across Europe with expansions to more markets during the fourth quarter of this year. Moreover, the iGaming content provider hinted at additional deals in Switzerland that can be expected soon.</p>
<p>The deal with Casino Lugano in Switzerland comes after earlier this month, Yggdrasil confirmed it hired Alex Haywood. At the time of the announcement, the iGaming content provider revealed that Haywood will serve as the Managing Director of its Polish entity.</p>
