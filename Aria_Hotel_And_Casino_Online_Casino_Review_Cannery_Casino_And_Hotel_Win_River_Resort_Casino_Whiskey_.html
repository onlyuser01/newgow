    <h1>Aria Hotel And Casino Online Casino Review Cannery Casino And Hotel Win River Resort Casino Whiskey</h1>

<p>HitSqwad has received a Remote Gambling Software License from the UK Gambling Commission and has become the latest company to secure an entry into the country’s expanding iGaming sector.</p>
<p>Despite regulatory headwinds, interest in iGaming remains robust as HitSqwad is now able to create and deliver online games and supply them to operators in the UK market. This is part of a much bigger plan, which the company is in the process of detailing. The company will take a little before it goes live, though.</p>
<p>Going after Licenses in the Biggest Markets</p>
<p>HitSqwad is planning a launch early next year with Playzido. Other brands may soon follow. Commenting on this milestone, HitSqwad CEO Charl Geyser explained how important it was for the company to have a license from one of the strictest gambling regulators in the world.</p>
<p>The significance of the license comes in a broader context, as this is the first major regulatory go-ahead for the company, which will seek to expand in other large gambling markets.</p>
<p>“Our strategy going forward is to now secure additional licenses in other key regulated markets with the objective being to provide as many operators and their customers with access to our innovative and exciting jackpot games as possible.” HitSqwad CEO Charl Geyser</p>
<p>Geyser spoke about HitSqwad’s flexible and tailored platform that is able to deliver on a range of experiences and preferences. The company is confident that it can create unique and appropriate solutions for each market it targets.</p>
<p>HitSqwad Ready for Regulatory Headwinds in the UK</p>
<p>The UK will be one of the biggest challenges for HitSqwad because of the market’s regulatory makeup. However, the company feels confident in its abilities to deliver compliance-ready products, owing to its ability to create and adjust any product that comes out of its studio line. Geyser noted that meeting local regulatory standards should be easy enough.</p>
<p>Never mind this, HitSqwad is determined to steal a march on competitors and create a series of jackpot games that will be built together into a franchise model. These games will be distinct enough, even though they would belong to the same family, allowing each partner in the UK to choose a game that better reflects their identity and customer base.</p>
<p>HitSqwad has promised a mobile-first approach towards all of its games, as well as the jackpot series. In a conversation with GamblingNews in September, Geyser detailed the company’s aspirations in the jackpot segment, which remains one of the focal points of development efforts for the studio.</p>
