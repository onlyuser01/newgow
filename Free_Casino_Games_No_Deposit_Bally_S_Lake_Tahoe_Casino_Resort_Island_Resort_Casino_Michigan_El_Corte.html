<p>3 Oaks Gaming continues to grow and build up momentum in the European iGaming market. The company, which specializes in the distribution of iGaming content, has signed a new partnership with Cosmolot. This will allow the supplier to deploy popular games such as Aztec Fire, Eggs of Gold, Lotus Charm, and others.</p>
<p>Cosmolot Is Committed to Growing Its Content Offering</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming’s titles come along with a number of excellent features and mechanics that are designed to make the experience a great bit of fun. 3 Oaks Gaming has also been able to gather great momentum in the iGaming sector, after teaming up with several prominent operators across multiple European jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Company managing director Sebastian Damian welcomed the opportunity to be working with Cosmolot and said that it was a prominent and highly trusted brand that 3 Oaks wanted to definitely continue to work with. He highlighted some of the features and opportunities that are bound to appeal to players:</p>
<p>We have no doubt that players will come to love our slots, which feature a mix of themes and mechanics, including the ever-popular Hold &amp; Win format. Company managing director Sebastian Damian</p>
<p>The year has been a busy one for 3 Oaks Gaming, Damian noted. This was no doubt thanks to the company’s excellent portfolio of content worthy of tier one operators.</p>
<p>The partnership was also welcomed by Cosmolot founder and board member Sergey Potapov. Potapov said that the company was committed to evolving its online offering and featuring new casino games on regular basis. 3 Oaks Gaming is just another step in fulfilling this commitment and providing players with the best possible experience available to them. He added:</p>
<p>The 3 Oaks Gaming team has been a pleasure to work with, and we look forward to welcoming more of its impressive content over the coming months. Cosmolot founder and board member Sergey Potapov</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming Signs Multiple Partnerships in Recent Months</p>
<p>Recently, 3 Oaks Gaming also launched with Favbet as the company continued to expand its iGaming footprint in Europe. 3 Oaks Gaming’s portfolio got a significant boost earlier this year when Big Time Gaming agreed to license its signature Megaways mechanic that is now being featured with some of 3 Oaks Gaming’s most prominent games.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming is competing in a highly contested market where suppliers are trying to increase their footprint and strike home with more player bases. The fact that 3 Oaks Gaming is capable of leveraging its offer and increasing its jurisdictional reach is an important indicator that the company is actually navigating the iGaming seas well.</p>
