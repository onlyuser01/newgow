<p>Matthew Stafford is taking on his former team this Sunday. The Detroit Lions is the team where the quarterback had spent 11 seasons before moving to California earlier this year. With Stafford in the LA Rams jersey, this team has gone 5-1.</p>
<p>When Stafford went to LA, Jared Goff went the other way. Unfortunately for the two-time Pro Bowler, he hasn’t done much since coming to Detroit. Actually, Goff’s new team is by far the worst in the NFL, with nothing but losses in the 2021 season.</p>
<p>Is there another loss on the way for Detroit? It seems like that is the case. The moneyline odds on the rams are +900, suggesting that the oddsmakers expect to see an easy win for the Los Angeles-based franchise.</p>
<p>In fact, it appears that when it comes to the Lions vs Rams game, the real question isn’t who will win. Instead, it’s whether the Rams can cover the 15-point spread.</p>
<p>Let’s see if they can do it!</p>
<p>Lions vs Rams Odds (NFL Week 7, 2021)</p>
<p>All odds are per DraftKings as of October 19.</p>
<p>Moneyline</p>
<p>Detroit Lions +600 Los Angeles Rams -900</p>
<p>Spread</p>
<p>Detroit Lions +14.5 -110 Los Angeles Rams -14.5 -110</p>
<p>Over/Under</p>
<p>Over 50.5 -110 Under 50.5 -110</p>
<p>Where and When to Watch</p>

<p>Matt Stafford to Make an MVP Claim?</p>
<p>The Rams’ quarterback is currently the #4 in the list of top MVP favorites. At DraftKings, the odds of him winning the award are +1200.</p>
<p>They might get shorter after Week 7, when he’ll play against his former teammates. If there’s someone who knows their strengths and weaknesses, it’s Stafford.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn’t the case, everyone would still expect to see a lot from the QB. After all, he’s been in really great form in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Last weekend, for instance, we saw Stafford throwing for 251 yards against the New York Giants. The fact that that was the least number of yards per game he’s made this season shows just how phenomenal he’s been so far.</p>
<p>He didn’t cover as many yards as usual, but he did make plenty of crucial passes in that game. In fact, four of his throws resulted in a touchdown.</p>
<p>Jared Goff Coming Home</p>
<p>Goff’s return to Los Angeles probably isn’t going to be great. The quarterback is having one of the worst seasons of his career, with 1,505 passing yards in six games, seven touchdowns, and four interceptions.</p>
<p>Although he’s not a bad QB, his new teammates just aren’t good enough to provide him with decent support.</p>
<p>Evidence of this is that the Detroit Lions is the only NFL team with a 0-6 record in the 2021 season. What’s worse is that their schedule hasn’t been as bad as one might assume based on their stats.</p>
<p>In fact, their toughest challenge of the season comes this Sunday. The Rams are better than them in all aspects of the game, which is why it’s no surprise the bookies have set the spread to 15 points. Will the Rams cover it? Probably.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles Rams to win and cover the spread; under 50.5 should hit.</p>
