<p>The dazzling slot celebrating the birth of a nation has been described as another “game sensation” by the provider. This is thanks to its excellent stunning graphics and fully immersive gameplay that will instantly carry players to a place where patriotism and celebrations are in bloom.</p>
<p>The symbols have been carefully picked and designed to express the same festive atmosphere. The low-paying symbols are represented by the themed 9s, 10s, Js, Qs, Ks, and As. Uncle Sam’s hats, hot dogs, and baseball gloves bring more consistent wins on the grid while two of the nation’s most iconic symbols, the White House and the Statue of Liberty pay the most.</p>
<p>The game is also played with the American bald eagle as the wild symbol that generates winning combinations when it replaces the rest of the symbols with the exception of the jets scatter symbols.</p>
<p>Players who land a minimum of three sets of jet symbols on any location on the reels enter the juicy bonus round. The latter counts 15 free spins and it is plated similarly to the base game.</p>
<p>However, there is a catch. All wins are worth three times thanks to the 3x multiplier that Dragon Gaming has embedded in the fun gameplay. The multiplier does not apply to matches that consist of five wild symbols. The available paylines are fixed and they pay left to right.</p>
<p>In May, the studio released Battle Ops, a 5×3 military-themed slot with expanding wilds, extra spins, and free spins. Before that, Dragon Gaming announced a series of other exciting game launches including Play With Cleo Scratchcard and Rise of the Titans.</p>
