    <h1>Casino Live Online Sycuan Casino Hotel Catskill Casino Snoqualmie Casino Buffet Cryptoloko Casino De</h1>

<p>Design Works Gaming (DWG), a studio that creates top-performing casino games for the industry’s biggest names, has joined forces with Caesars Entertainment, one of the powerhouses in American gaming. Under the agreement with the casino juggernaut, the supplier will provide its Michigan casino with games.</p>
<p>DWG to Provide Caesars with Games</p>
<p>As agreed, DWG will power Caesars Michigan with its acclaimed suite of slots and LuckyTap titles. Major releases from the supplier will go live at the casino in the Great Lake State, with hits such as Break the Bounty LuckyTap and 10X Fortune already available thanks to Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming aggregation platform.</p>
<p>DWG and Caesars don’t plan to stop there. The companies have also negotiated the launch of more DWG products with other Caesars brands, including Harrah’s Casino and the World Series of Poker. This will see the two companies work together in other states than Michigan.</p>
<p>The current agreement will expand DWG’s footprint in the United States. The provider already has some presence in the American market and is powering gaming companies in Connecticut, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The gaming supplier’s first foray into Michigan was a week ago when the company joined forces with DraftKings, another major US gambling and sports betting company.</p>
<p>Caesars Is the Perfect Home for DWG Content</p>
<p>Matthew Sunderland, Caesars Entertainment’s senior vice president of iGaming, spoke about the agreement with DWG. He said that Caesars is always looking to provide its customers with an exceptional experience. Because of that, Sunderland was happy to welcome DWG to the list of Caesars partners. He noted that DWG shares the same vision as the casino operator and is committed to bringing innovative experiences to the market.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to offer Caesars players in Michigan access to DWG’s quality titles. Matthew Sunderland, SVP iGaming, Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Troy Zurawski, DWG’s chief executive officer, said that Caesars is “the perfect home for DWG content.” He praised Caesars for its iconic gaming brands and said that he is looking forward to working with the operator. Zurawski concluded that he is sure Caesars and its customers are going to love what DWG has to offer:</p>
<p>By launching initially with Caesars Casino Michigan, we’re bringing our top titles to a significant audience with high expectations for their gaming experience. We’re confident that Caesars Entertainment will love what DWG brings to the table. Troy Zurawski, CEO, DWG</p>
<p>Speaking of Zurawski, in July, GamblingNews interviewed the CEO about his company’s successful Europe and USA-oriented strategy.</p>
