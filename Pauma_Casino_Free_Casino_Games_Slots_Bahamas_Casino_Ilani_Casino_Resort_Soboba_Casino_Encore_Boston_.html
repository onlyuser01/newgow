<p>The agreement comes after an intense round of negotiations between UNITE HERE Local 26, Teamsters Local 25, and the casino management, finally bringing an end to months of uncertainty for over 1,400 workers</p>
<p>In a significant breakthrough, unionized workers at Encore Boston Harbor casino in Everett have reached a “tentative agreement” on a new contract with Wynn Resorts, effectively avoiding the scheduled strike set to begin on June 30.</p>
<p>Union Workers and Wynn Resorts Find Common Ground in Contract Negotiations</p>
<p>The breakthrough was announced on June 29 following an hours-long bargaining session that involved union leaders and representatives from Wynn Resorts. Both parties expressed their satisfaction with the terms of the agreement, which they believe fulfils the workers’ demands for better wages, benefits, and job security.</p>
<p>Boston media outlet WGBH reported that UNITE HERE Local 26 president, Carlos Aramayo, praised the casino’s management for demonstrating leadership by agreeing to a contract that ensures excellent wages and benefits for the resort’s workers. He further expressed relief that a strike would be avoided and emphasized the spirit of partnership that prevailed during the negotiations.</p>
<p>The specific details of the contract remain undisclosed, pending a ratification vote scheduled for June 30. However, the union is optimistic that the agreement achieves its objective of a “five-star contract” with competitive wages and top-notch benefits, surpassing industry standards.</p>
<p>The workers represented by UNITE HERE Local 26 and Teamsters Local 25 encompass a diverse range of roles, from room attendants and cocktail servers to delivery drivers and bar porters. The Encore Boston Harbor casino, owned by Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts, has been under pressure to reach a new contract since the previous one expired in April. Union leaders had threatened to initiate a 24/7 picket line if an agreement wasn’t reached in time.</p>
<p>Encore Boston Harbor Sets New Standard with Exceptional Compensation and Benefits</p>
<p>Encore Boston Harbor expressed its satisfaction with the outcome, stating that the agreement aligns with the company’s commitment to providing exceptional compensation and benefits, making it one of the most attractive workplaces in Massachusetts’ hospitality industry.</p>
<p>While the contract did not address every issue, it made significant strides in rectifying wage disparities and improving work conditions for employees. With the tentative agreement in place, both Encore Boston Harbor and its dedicated workforce are looking forward to a new chapter of cooperation and harmonious relations, ensuring a better future for all involved parties.</p>
<p>Back in February, Wynn Resorts received approval from the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) to construct a new building near its Encore Boston Harbor casino, allowing for expanded offerings including sports betting and poker. The decision came after a favorable interpretation of a 2013 casino referendum, allowing authorized gaming on both sides of Route 99. With the recent legalization of sports betting in Massachusetts, Wynn’s expansion plans are seen as a significant step in the growing gambling scene in the state.</p>
