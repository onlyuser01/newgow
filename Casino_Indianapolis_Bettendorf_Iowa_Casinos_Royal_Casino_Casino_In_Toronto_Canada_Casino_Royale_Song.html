<p>With its grand opening less than a week away, Resorts World Las Vegas on the Strip was the site of a fire this weekend.</p>

<p>The fire at about 6 pm on Saturday occurred in a storage area where building materials and mechanical equipment are kept, according to KLAS-TV. The fire was behind the parking garage.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses posted photographs and video on social media sites, showing flames and billowing smoke at the site of the 3,506-room resort on the northwest end of the Strip.</p>
<p>The red-tinted Resorts World Las Vegas is just south of Circus Circus and the smaller Slot-A-Fun. The $4.3 billion resort is set to open on Thursday.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the blaze, which did not spread to other structures, according to fire officials. The cause is under investigation.</p>
<p>The fire occurred as the temperature in the Las Vegas Valley soared to 114 degrees on Saturday, tying a record for that date set in 1940. Las Vegas has been in the midst of a heat wave, reaching 100-degree temperatures for the first time since Oct. 1, 2020.</p>
<p>Eyewitness Makayla Williams told the television station the fire created a traffic jam on the Strip.</p>
<p>We saw the fire at the building and there was smoke, and it took us around the Strip causing a 20-minute back up,” Williams said.</p>
<p>James Banks, a visitor from Phoenix, noted that the fire created a large amount of smoke.</p>
<p>“Looked like something had been burning for quite some time, and all we saw was plumes of smoke in the sky,” he told the television station.</p>
<p>Las Vegas resident Chris Walton said the fire was “scary” because the hotel-casino is new.</p>
<p>“They shouldn’t be having these problems,” he said.</p>
<p>‘Sexual Wellness’</p>
<p>Resorts World Las Vegas is the first new hotel-casino to open on the Strip since December 2010, when the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas began operating. In February, “multiple” people were hospitalized from smoke caused by a fire at the Cosmopolitan, officials said. Smoke in the hallway on the 51st floor came from a balcony at one of the rooms.</p>
<p>At its opening, Resorts World will feature more than 40 places for food and beverages. These include a vegan ice cream store and a bubble tea shop called Tiger Sugar.</p>
<p>The site also will include a Kardashian Kloset pop-up store. The store will sell items once belonging to reality television personalities in the blended Kardashian-Jenner family.</p>
<p>Also included is a Pepper sexual wellness shop with licensed sexologists on staff. Pepper also will have employees in a “key holder” role. In addition to other duties, this job requires employees to “engage guests in conversations about sexual wellness.”</p>
<p>Former Mafia Site</p>
<p>Resorts World was constructed on the Strip where the Stardust Casino once stood. At one time, the Stardust was overseen by Chicago oddsmaker Frank “Lefty” Rosenthal for Midwestern crime families.</p>
<p>This era was portrayed in former New York crime reporter Nicholas Pileggi’s nonfiction book, Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas. Pileggi and director Martin Scorsese cowrote the screenplay for the 1995 movie Casino, a fictionalized account of the book.</p>
