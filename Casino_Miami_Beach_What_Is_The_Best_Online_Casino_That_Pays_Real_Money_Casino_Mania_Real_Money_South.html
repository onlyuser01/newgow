    <h1>Casino Miami Beach What Is The Best Online Casino That Pays Real Money Casino Mania Real Money South</h1>

<p>Payment giant Paysafe Group will lend its technological acumen to boost BetWildwood Sportsbook’s offer in Colorado introducing numerous tools to improve payment acceptance, facilitate transactions for consumers, and boost engagement.</p>
<p>BetWildwood Gets Payment Streamlined with Paysafe’s Help</p>
<p>BetWildwood, a dedicated online sportsbook running out of Wildwood Casino in Colorado, has teamed up with a new worthwhile payment processor partner in the face of Paysafe. The deal will see Paysafe integrate its entire portfolio, including Income Access, the company’s dedicated marketing technology and service.</p>
<p>Thanks to this addition, BetWildwood will have a strong chance to make its affiliate partnership program work, attract and engage new customers in what is shaping to be a highly-competitive market in Colorado.</p>
<p>Just recently, Superbook went live in Colorado and 888 announced plans to roll out a betting operator of its own in the Centennial State. Commenting on this fresh alliance, Paysafe Director of Business Development for iGaming Gregory Kirstein said that the company was thrilled to team up with BetWildwood.</p>
<p>The partnership will allow Paysafe to improve the brand’s payment offering and streamline depositing and withdrawal options for consumers who join the desktop and mobile sportsbook to satiate their hunger for sports betting action.</p>
<p>Thanks to Income Access, the brand will be able to achieve better synergies with affiliates and attract more customers in the short and long-term, Kirstein explained, adding that “BetWildwood is well-positioned for long-term success through the combination of our payment and marketing solutions.”</p>
<p>Boosting Engagement in a Growing Market</p>
<p>This partnership comes at a particularly auspicious moment for the state with sportsbooks clocking in $231 million in November, the most recent update about sports betting results in the state.</p>
<p>For his part, ISI President Bill Stearns added that the partnership with Paysafe ensured customers a diverse and strong offer, as well as a secure and user-friendly payment solution. Thanks to Paysafe’s integrated and omnichannel experience, Stearns is confident that BetWildwood will be able to outpace the competition in terms of banking options.</p>
<p>Stearns is equally excited about the launch of the Income Access in conjunction with the company’s affiliate program for better growth and engagement with consumers in Colorado.</p>
<p>BetWildwood is competing in a highly-contested state where having great marketing and retention strategies are the leading way of securing a decent share of the business.</p>
<p>Paysafe will help BetWildwood optimize payment acceptance and boost the security of the sportsbook’s overall payment product as an additional upside of the partnership.</p>
