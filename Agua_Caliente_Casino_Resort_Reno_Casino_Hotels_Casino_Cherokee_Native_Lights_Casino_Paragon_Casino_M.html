    <h1>Agua Caliente Casino Resort Reno Casino Hotels Casino Cherokee Native Lights Casino Paragon Casino M</h1>

<p>Agree with other complaints that the withdrawal process is intentionally (and borderline maliciously) delayed &amp; convoluted. The casino has no issue taking deposits without verification, but suddenly initiates an intense &amp; arbitrary identity investigation when you withdrawal using the same method. In my case, I used PayPal. I deposited without issue, won a significant chunk, and requested a withdrawal. Then I was prompted to provide identity verification of the PayPal account, which I quickly did. I e-mailed customer service for a follow up— no response. Live chat provided no insight into the reason for delay or timeline for disbursement. I looked at the app reviews from the Apple Store, and they tell the actual truth that many casino review sites seem to omit— this is a CONSTANT ISSUE. The app has a 1.8 star rating with ~75% of the reviews referencing similar withdrawal issues lasting up to and over a year. To the extent Golden Nugget, or any casino, is concerned with identity verification, why do they not conduct this process BEFORE allowing you to deposit any sum of money? Even worse, they continue to allow you to deposit using the SAME METHOD while the "verification" is processing. This completely undermines the purpose of the process. In short, they have no issue with where the money is coming from, the concern only arises when it’s time to pay. This is unethical &amp; predatory, as they know the longer a withdrawal is pending, the more likely the player is to cancel the withdrawal.</p>
<p>I am disappointed to see none of these sites have mentioned this issue as it is plastered all over every actual player review. Golden casino has a great platform and good games— but that is pointless if there is no way to collect your winnings.</p>
