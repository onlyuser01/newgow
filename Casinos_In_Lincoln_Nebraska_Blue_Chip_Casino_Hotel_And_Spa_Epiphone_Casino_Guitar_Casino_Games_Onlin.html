<p>Smart Gaming B.V. has become the latest regulated operator in the Dutch gaming market. The operator is in fact the 21st entity to have been issued a license to run gambling products under the country’s law with the regulator, Dutch Gambling Authority, agreeing that the company has met all necessary criteria to join the market and satisfies industry standards.</p>
<p>The regulator did not go into too many details about the new license holder. Smart Gaming has so far not confirmed any domains that it intends to use in the Netherlands. Smart Gaming will probably be making the names of the websites it seeks to launch in the country known soon, however.</p>
<p>The country has proven a strong market in Europe, and even though the Netherlands has some very strict industrycontrols in place, it has still appealed to enough companies to make it highly competitive and thriving. More applicants are entering the market, which has proven an important one if somewhat too strictly regulated.</p>
<p>Then again, strict regulation has been the backbone of some of the safest igaming and sports wagering markets in Europe, including Sweden, Denmark, Italy, and now the Netherlands. Prior to Smart Gaming’s license approval, the Dutch regulator approved ComeOn Group for launch in the country, with the Group launching its namesake brand, ComeOn. This happened last week.</p>
<p>The licensing of both ComeOn Group and Smart Gaming comes at an interesting time. The Netherlands is taking a hard look at how it regulates gambling as of right now. After previously banning popular people from advertising or associating themselves with gambling products, the country is now questioning whether its operators are doing enough to safeguard consumers.</p>
<p>According to Dutch Gambling Authority Chair René Jansen, there is definitely more than local operators can be doing to catch up to the standards used in other European markets. The country too has been acting to help ensure that consumers remain safe and protected.</p>
<p>The Netherlands announced the roll-out of the ZonMw Prevention of Gambling Addiction program, which is set to launch officially soon and it will assist consumers to avoid destructive gambling patterns and help with problem gambling prevention.</p>
