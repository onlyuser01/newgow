    <h1>Sloto Casino Caf Casino Casino Real Money Pennsylvania Online Casinos Casino Meaning Elite24Bet Casi</h1>

<p>Thank you very much for your email, soufvdbuurt. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>„15.10 Third party deposits are not allowed; therefore, all payments into your account must be made from a payment source in which you are the named account holder. In case of any inconsistency, Elite reserves the right to request the necessary documentation in order to carry out the required checks. The investigation may also lead to the voiding of winnings."</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players:</p>
<p>"Payments</p>
<p>For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Technically it is very difficult to check who’s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked only during the account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested. Therefore, it is a player’s responsibility to use allowed payment methods only.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to prove that you are a legitimate owner of the payment method and you haven’t received approval from the casino allowing you to use a third-party payment method, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
