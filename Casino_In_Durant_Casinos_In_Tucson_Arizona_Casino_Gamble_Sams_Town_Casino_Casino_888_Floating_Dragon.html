<p>Floating Dragon Hold and Spin review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around East Asian kites.</p>
<p>Players hover in a sunset sky among a flock of whimsical kites including birds, fish, and of course a fierce dragon. The dragon most of all seems to be a living creature among paper kites.</p>
<p>The festival atmosphere is captivating, as players test their will to see who will fly the highest. The dreamy nature of this world is uplifting and easy to get lost in.</p>
<p>Big win in the Floating Dragon Hold and Spin slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a gentle series of flute-like melodies. This reinforces the sense that players are in a fantasy East Asian setting.</p>
<p>The animation of the sunset backdrop is breathtaking and calming. The gradient of blue, purple, and orange bring to mind a watercolour painting. A blur of white birds occasionally glides by, suggesting players are at least as high as a bird might fly.</p>
<p>The symbols suggest various types of kites from a rainbow butterfly, to a ship with sails full of wind, to brighty hued fish in traditional designs. It’s easy to imagine the colourful creatures soaring high above the ground, suspended by wind.</p>
<p>A beautiful girl peers out from one symbol, her hair combed into an intricate hair piece. She looks at the player with an alluring gaze.</p>
<p>The dragon symbol explodes from his reel with horns and whiskers extending beyond its limits. His expression is crazed and furious as if he is heading into battle.</p>
<p>Overall, the front end of this game has a delightful aesthetic that is both engrossing and calming.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Floating Dragon Hold and Spin is a five reel, three row slot, with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>The gameplay stays fast and engaging. Players will be familiar with the style.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol and the Money symbol. The Wild symbol appears on all the reels while players are in the Free Spins round.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol appears on all the reels.</p>
<p>When players land 3 or more Scatter symbols, the Free Spin feature is triggered. The greater the number of Scatters, the greater the number of free spins. For example:</p>
<p>3 Scatters: 10 free spins</p>
<p>4 Scatters: 15 free spins</p>
<p>5 Scatters: 20 free spins</p>
<p>While in the Free Spins feature, every Wild symbol gathers value from Fish Money symbols.</p>
<p>Whenever Wilds land during the Free Spins Feature, they are collected and saved to the end of the round. Every fourth Wild gathered retriggers the Free Spins feature and increases the Money symbol multiplier. The feature can be retriggered up to 3 times.</p>
<p>Wild symbol collects fish symbol prizes</p>
<p>The maximum win is limited to x5000 the player’s total bet, and, if player’s achieve this, the round will end immediately.</p>
<p>The Money symbol is assigned a random value during every spin from x1 to x20. It appears only on the middle reel.</p>
<p>When 3 Money symbols land, this prompts the Hold &amp; Spin Bonus feature. During this feature, the middle reel symbols are held in place and the other reels vanish.</p>
<p>Hold and Spin bonus feature</p>
<p>The player begins with 3 respins and any Money symbols that land will reset the respins back to 3. The value of all the middle reel’s Money symbols are added to the player's total win.</p>
<p>The Diamond Money symbol appears on reels 1, 2, 4, and 5 while players are in the Hold &amp; Spin feature. When this symbol lands, it is randomly assigned a value between x100 and x4993.</p>
<p>If player doesn't reach the guaranteed win in the Hold &amp; Spin bonus feature, respins again to 3. Guaranteed win of this feature is player’s total bet x20.</p>
