    <h1>888 Casino Login Black Bear Casino Hotel Mychoice Casino Home Bellagio Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Vi</h1>

<p>i would like to advise that I have in fact received my money back via Bitcoin this morning.</p>
<p>i appreciate the refund, but I would really appreciate some disclosure regarding the "negative activity" that was the reason for this issue in the first place-</p>
<p>I did nothing wrong. No fraud, no scam, all of my cards and ID matched my actual identity. I played the games as any normal person would. What negative activity are you referring to?</p>
<p>to be clear, this wasn’t an amicable solution for me. Maybe this is acceptable to you but facts on the case are- I deposited legitimately into your casino, I won money. You blocked my account after winning money, then decided that instead of pay me what I won, you were just going to refund my deposits which was about $500 usd less than my winnings were.</p>
<p>so to conclude it would appear that you don’t like to pay when people win, and instead of just stealing the money all together, you refund the initial amount deposited.</p>
<p>again, I appreciate the refund, but I didn’t play on your site to achieve a refund, I played to win, which I did.</p>
<p>You have given me absolutely zero information as to what negative activity I engaged in that warrants this block and to deny my winnings, that seems unfair to me.</p>
<p>a casino is where people go to play to win. Had I hit a jackpot for 50k would you have done the exact same thing? Deny my winnings and refund my deposit? It’s like either you have to lose to the house or just get your money back when you actually win, there’s nothing casino about that. Customers have no chance of winning and at best can only break back even after a week or more of headaches and arguments about money that’s rightfully mine! Thanks again for the refund but I still feel scammed.</p>
