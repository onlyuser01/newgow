<p>Welcome to my dedicated Las Vegas USA Casino review. Here I will talk about one of Mainstreet Vegas Group’s flagship casino properties operating online since 2002. The casino is one of the most recognizable brand names and a supplier of excellent gaming options for players in the United States and beyond. I have covered everything from the 400% match bonus up to $10,000 to the selection of awesome Real Time Gaming slots, table games, video poker, and miscellaneous games you can enjoy.</p>
<p>The website is based in Costa Rica and licensed in Panama. It feels and runs great on any mobile device, and you can expect awesome overall gameplay and promotional offer. All you need to do to get started is to set up your casino account with a few simple clicks. Let’s take a look at the casino one last time before we dive into each section.</p>
<p>Las Vegas USA Online Casino Overview</p>
<p>The Las Vegas USA online casino is an established name with plenty to offer. I have played at the casino before, but reviewing it today gave me additional insight. If in the past, I approached the casino as a casual player, my perception has shifted to a critical reviewer in the most present visit to the website.</p>
<p>I was pleased to find a website powered by Real Time Gaming (RGT) software, but not just the regular games. RTG has developed a special brand of online slot machines known as Real Series that are now available on Las Vegas USA Casino.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the casino is certified by the Central Dispute System (CDS), which means that the casino undergoes regular audits to guarantee the fairness and safety of its offer. These inspections are carried out by an independent third-party which checks everything from how your personal information is stored to the payout fairness of each individual game.</p>
<p>US players will have the ability to tap into over 200 dedicated casino games and also scoop up an awesome $10,000 bonus on their way in. Well, with this said, I am now excited to introduce you to the rest of the Las Vegas USA Casino. Let’s go through my review together.</p>
<p>What Las Vegas USA Casino Payment Methods Exist?</p>
<p>To provide you with the best overall banking experience, the casino has tapped into various payment methods that are known to most players. In fact, you may have used the listed banking options already for e-shopping or paying the bills. Now, you can also use them to top up your casino account. Here is an overview of all available payment options. You are free to choose the one that suits you best.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>When it comes to online casino deposits, it’s always smart to have a choice. Las Vegas USA Casino has capitalized on that offering you not one but four dedicated payment solutions. Upon reviewing each method individually, I established that they are all safe, intuitive, and a quick way to deposit. Players can pick from the following payment methods:</p>
<p>Deposit Method Minimum Maximum Fee Visa $20 $5,000 None MasterCard $20 $5,000 None American Express $20 $5,000 None Bitcoin $5 $500 None</p>
<p>All Las Vegas USA online casino deposit methods are available worldwide. I found the payment options to be flexible enough. For starters, you can deposit with your regular Visa or MasterCard, but then again prepaid &amp; gift cards are also accepted.</p>
<p>Some players prefer to use those as they leave less of a trace about who you are and your financial details. The minimum deposit amount per transaction is $20 for all bank cards and $5 for Bitcoin, which gives you some flexibility.</p>
<p>To deposit over $500, though, you will need to use one of the accepted payment methods. All deposits are instant and they charge no additional fees. In some jurisdictions, Neteller may be available. If so, players can deposit instantly between $25 and $2,500.</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>As to withdrawals, the minimum and maximum amounts are quite generous and flexible. You will have four recognized payment methods to use and withdraw your money. Each payment method may have slightly different payout speed, so keep this in mind. Overall, though, the experience is quite tailored to the needs of the average consumers and you won’t have to wait too long to withdraw your money.</p>
<p>Withdrawal Method Minimum Maximum Fee Check via Mail $150 $399 None Check via Courier $400 $2,500 None ACH Direct Deposit $150 $1,250 None Bitcoin $150 $5,000 None</p>
<p>To withdraw money from Las Vegas USA casino you will be able to pick from any payment method you like. Now, I agree that the minimum withdrawal amount is a bit steep. However, you won’t have to cover any fees, which is definitely a big relief.</p>
<p>In terms of limits per individual transaction, I am actually quite happy with the amounts. A Check via Mail is usually $399, but then again you can request a withdrawal worth $5,000 via Bitcoin and that seems perfectly reasonable to me.</p>
<p>Now, as to processing times, those would vary a little. For Checks, the delivery period may range from 3 business days to 10 business days. Bitcoin transactions are usually processed within 48 hours and ACH Direct might take up to 7 business days. Another thing to note is that there is a weekly withdrawal limit, that will change based on your Player Class, as follows:</p>
<p>Regular – $2,000</p>
<p>Silver – $3,000</p>
<p>Gold – $4,000</p>
<p>Platinum – $5,000</p>
<p>Diamond – $5,000</p>
<p>Another available payment method is Neteller although availability will range from country to country. Where Neteller is available to withdraw with, you can expect $150 – $5,000 and an instant withdrawal with $0 fees.</p>
<p>Play Las Vegas USA Casino on Mobile</p>
<p>The best way to experience a great casino is to try it on mobile. The casino uses dedicated software that allows you to enjoy mobile and remote gaming sessions without having to worry about a thing. So long as you have a device that connects to the Internet, you will be able to play remotely.</p>
<p>Whether you play from an iOS or Android device or from a Windows or Mac laptop, I recommend avoiding public Wi-Fi networks as they are rampant with malware that might seriously damage your device or even gain access to your casino information.</p>
<p>Download the Las Vegas USA Online Casino Software Today</p>
<p>A bit of a tribute to the past, Las Vegas USA lets you download and install a gaming platform that runs the entire casino. If you would much rather have the casino installed on your personal computer rather than load it up in a browser, that’s perfectly fine. All you need to do is follow several easy steps:</p>
<p>Go to the Free Download page and download the setup Start the setup and follow the installation process instructions You are free to pick the installation directory of the setup Once the installation is complete, you can launch the casino</p>
<p>The process is seamless and you should have no issue starting up Las Vegas USA online casino right from your desktop computer. The download platform offers a bit more comfort in my opinion and it’s nice to know you always have the casino on your desktop.</p>
<p>Install the Las Vegas USA Android App</p>
<p>If you insist on installing a dedicated app for your Android device, you may now do so. The Android app will give you a slightly more comfortable overall experience if you are playing on the go.</p>
<p>The installation size is just a few megabytes so no matter what the make of your device is, you will have no trouble running the Las Vegas USA Android app. All you need to do is click on the casino’s link to download the app from your smartphone.</p>
<p>Once you do, you will have to authorize your device to allow Unknown Devices. The installation wizard will execute automatically and you will be able to play on the go with a dedicated mobile app. Of course, you could just as easily set up a shortcut and just play the instant version of the casino.</p>
<p>Las Vegas USA Casino Bonuses: So Many to Choose From!</p>
<p>The casino’s main strength most certainly lies in the overwhelming selection of bonuses. Las Vegas USA Casino has gone the extra mile to provide you with numerous bonuses and promotions tailored to every taste and preference.</p>
<p>I have found reviewing these bonuses to be an excellent way to amass a little more money and have a more enjoyable experience. The casino has a truly amazing selection of bonuses I will cover right now. Keep in mind that some terms and conditions may change over time, so it’s always best to check with the casino’s T&amp;C first.</p>
<p>Get Started with $10,000 Bonus</p>
<p>What I would describe as one of the best bonuses, the $10,000 starter’s pack at Las Vegas USA is quite the generous promo. The bonus has a matched rate of 400% and the promotion is one of the biggest sign up offers players from the USA can enjoy.</p>
<p>To trigger the bonus, all you need to do is deposit any amount between $20 and $2,500 and use the Las Vegas USA Casino bonus code 400BONUS. Thanks to the generous rate, you don’t have to deposit too much as the 400% match rate kicks in and gives you some great head start.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have noticed that you would need to roll over the deposit and bonus amount 40 times to release your funds.</p>
<p>Play Table Games the $3,000 Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>To make the experience better-rounded, Las Vegas USA Casino has come up with another excellent promotion for your comfort. The $3,000 welcome bonus will hook you up with a neat 150% match bonus for your favorite table games and video poker options.</p>
<p>While this is definitely an awesome amount to play with, especially when it comes to table games, the bonus will come with 90x rollover requirements. Now, that is definitely very hard to pull off, so if you are claiming the full $3,000, you are looking at a $270,000 before you can withdraw your funds.</p>
<p>The upside is that table games have very high betting limits, so that should go relatively fast, but still. Accept this bonus after having considered it carefully. To activate the bonus just use the IDBLASVEGAS bonus code.</p>
<p>A Dedicated Slot Bonus with Double Match $7,000</p>
<p>Another promotional offer you may want to try is the 200% Double Match Bonus which will offer you up to $7,000 in free cash to use on your favorite slots, scratchcards, and keno. To activate the bonus you need to deposit at least $20 and punch in the SLOTS200 bonus code.</p>
<p>More Daily Promotions with Las Vegas USA Casino</p>
<p>Las Vegas Casino has packed a whole lot of additional promotions to try. They each come at a different time of the week, which adds a bit of exclusivity to the overall offer and definitely makes your stay at the casino worth it. Players will have all sorts of promos to pick from, too throughout the week.</p>
<p>There is the Double Match Up Monday with a 200% bonus. You will certainly enjoy the Cashback Monday $500 Bonus that comes with no playthrough requirements as much as I did. Tuesdays and Thursdays are reserved for the T-Blend where you get to try new games, win some free spins, and get extra chips.</p>
<p>Wild Wednesday will fetch you a 300% bonus for you to enjoy along with the triple weekend winner bonus worth 250% in play funds. Meanwhile, there are tons of other promos that you can access readily and enjoy as an existing player.</p>
<p>These promos include excellent treats such as special holiday bonuses, season bonuses, birthday bonuses, weekly cash backs, a refer-a-friend promo, slot tournaments, and even some free trials.</p>
<p>There is a lot that Las Vegas USA online casino actually offers players and whether that is some one-off special bonus treat or a weekly bonus, you can rest assured there are promos for all players!</p>
<p>Daily Promos</p>
<p>Here is a quick list I have put together for your comfort to help you navigate the awesome promotions currently available promos at Las Vegas USA Casino.</p>
<p>Daily Promotion Details Double Match Up Monday A $200 deposit bonus. Cashback Monday Claim up to $500 on Monday. Tuesday &amp; Thursdays: T-Blend A free spins and free chips bonus. Wild Wednesday A $300 deposit bonus. Triple Weekend Winner A 250% matched bonus over the weekend.</p>
<p>All of these bonuses have Terms and Conditions that apply to each offer. Make sure to have a look at the terms once you set up your Las Vegas USA account.</p>
<p>Other Promos</p>
<p>The “other promos” at Las Vegas USA cover anything from birthdays to anniversary bonuses. They won’t be available to all, but you can get a good feel at how generous the casino is.</p>
<p>Special Bonuses Details Special Holiday Bonuses Get a special bonus treat for Christmas, Halloween, St Patrick’s Day, or some other special occasion. Season Bonus Each season will have a special set of exclusive bonuses to enjoy. Birthday Bonus It’s your birthday? Las Vegas USA Casino cares and you will get some treatment. Anniversary Bonus The anniversary of your registration means another bonus to enjoy. Weekly Cash Back Weekly cashbacks are Las Vegas USA’s way to incentivize players to have fun. Quick Verification Program Pass the verification process to establish your identity and get a special treat. Refer-a-Friend Don’t hesitate to bring your friends over and enjoy more money to play with. Monthly Loyalty Program A multi-tier loyalty program with a host of rewards to players, including special bonus prizes, comp points, and more. Slots Tournaments Every once in awhile Las Vegas USA will offer you to join the special slot tournaments and play your favorite games while amassing more points. Free Money Various free money bonuses are available at the casino on occasion. Don’t miss it out.</p>
<p>Now, I have noticed that Mainstreet Vegas Group tends to mostly change all bonuses across its entire fleet of casinos. It’s possible to be some differences when you check the bonuses if I have not had time to update them just yet.</p>
<p>Either way, there are plenty of awesome bonuses that will surely be there when you go to check them out.</p>
<p>Become a Las Vegas USA Loyal Program Member</p>
<p>Being part of the loyalty program will pay off almost immediately. There are multiple perks to becoming a member, such as comp points, additional bonuses, and far more beneficial wagering requirements.</p>
<p>Every player will start at Regular and progress gradually through Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond ranks in the casino. As you scale up, the wagering requirements for most bonuses will start decreasing as well as per the following table:</p>
<p>Games Regular Silver Gold Platinum Diamond Slots 40x 40x 35x 30x 30x Video Poker 90x 80x 70x 50x 50x</p>
<p>Leveling up in the loyalty program isn’t difficult at all. You will accumulate loyalty points every month that will determine your rank the next month. All players start at Regular and there is no extra cost to joining the program. In fact, you are rolled into it automatically.</p>
<p>To unlock each level, you will need to redeem a specific amount of comp points. It goes according to the following redemption rate:</p>
<p>Silver – $200-$499</p>
<p>Gold – $500-$999</p>
<p>Platinum – $1,000 &amp; more</p>
<p>Diamond seems to be an invitation-only tier and it naturally offers the biggest list of perks that you can enjoy while at Las Vegas USA. I have even discovered some VIP games that are geared towards VIP gamers as well.</p>
<p>Las Vegas USA Online Casino Games</p>
<p>If you have a soft spot for great games, you will enjoy Las Vegas USA Online Casino. With over 200 dedicated titles, you can have fun playing slots, table games, and video poker titles. Besides, the casino also offers a dedicated live dealer casino we will explore in good time.</p>
<p>There are some awesome progressive jackpot games to try as well and the payout could reach over $1 million. I was very happy with exploring the casino’s full selection of titles, and I have every reason to believe that so would you!</p>
<p>Slot Games</p>
<p>Slot games are a big draw for anyone who wants to play at Las Vegas USA Casino. There are over 180 slot games to choose from and they range from awesome classics to the so-called Real Series which are RTG’s newest specialty.</p>
<p>Some of the top titles here include Aztec’s Millions, Jackpot Piñatas, Aladdin’s Wishes, Loch Ness Loot, Megasaur Slot, Triton’s Treasure, the Spirit of the Inca, and others. You will get an opportunity to try all sorts of progressive jackpots that are connected to the rest of the Real Time Gaming network.</p>
<p>The good news is RTG is constantly adding to their library of games and that is reflecting positively on the selection of games you would be able to find on Las Vegas USA, including:</p>
<p>Trigger Happy</p>
<p>Cash Bandits 2</p>
<p>Secret Symbol</p>
<p>Storm Lords</p>
<p>Mermaids Pearls</p>
<p>The Mariachi 5</p>
<p>Halloween Treasures</p>
<p>Fu Chi &amp; more</p>
<p>Some of these games will come with trend-breaking 243 and 1024 pay lines. Meanwhile, you can rest assured that all games feature awesome graphics and various features of the gameplay to make the experience more worthwhile.</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>Now, in terms of table games, Las Vegas USA has a bunch of good titles to choose from. The entire selection numbers over 20 dedicated games for you to try. Here are some you wouldn’t want to miss out on:</p>
<p>Baccarat European Roulette Pontoon Caribbean Stud Poker Face Up 21 Red Dog Casino War Let’em Ride Roulette Classic Blackjack Match Play 21 Super 21 Blackjack Craps Pai Gow Poker Texas Hold’em Bonus Poker European Blackjack Perfect Pairs Blackjack Tri-Card Poker</p>
<p>Video Poker Games</p>
<p>Video poker is definitely one of the best games you will find at any casino. It has a great house edge and relies on a blend of skill and luck. Real Time Gaming has allocated quite a bit of effort to create unique video poker games that are available to Las Vegas USA Casino fans today.</p>
<p>They are some of the best versions of the game and you can even use a strategy to try and beat the house. I definitely had fun playing video poker at Las Vegas USA, although I couldn’t really rely on a bonus because of the steep playthrough requirement. That’s no biggie, though, because you get to pick from:</p>
<p>7 Stud Poker Deuces Wild European Slot Poker Aces &amp; Eights Video Poker Double Double Bonus Jacks or Better Video Poker All American Video Poker Double Double Jackpot Joker Poker Bonus Deuces Wild Double Jackpot Loose Deuces Bonus Poker Double Jackpot Video Poker Mystery Bonus</p>
<p>Other worthwhile versions include Pick’em Poker and Sevens Wilds. Besides, there are other table games you can try as soon as you join the casino, so don’t miss out.</p>
<p>Las Vegas USA Live Dealer Casino</p>
<p>The Las Vegas USA Live Dealer Casino is awesome in every sense of the world. You will get to choose from different live titles, such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and Super 6. Besides, you will enjoy flexible table limits ranging from anything from $1 to $2,500 per single hand. Players can enjoy a bunch of games and some pretty decent table limits, as follows:</p>
<p>Blackjack HD, Blackjack Backbet ($10 – $2,500)</p>
<p>European, American Roulette ($1 – $1,000)</p>
<p>Baccarat ($5 – $1,000)</p>
<p>Live Super 6 ($5 – $1,000)</p>
<p>Real Time Gaming has a dedicated live dealer studio to make the experience even more entertaining for players. I definitely enjoyed my stay at the live casino, although it definitely takes a slightly bigger bankroll to experience.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>To get in touch with customer support, you will be free to pick from email and live chat. You can get in touch with the casino at [email protected] or just open a dedicated live chatbox. The instant chat is available 24/7 for your convenience and the customer support language is English.</p>
<p>My Final Thoughts on Las Vegas USA Casino</p>
<p>That was a long read, I know. Yet, I felt that Las Vegas USA online casino deserved a more thorough approach. The casino definitely has a lot to offer when you think about it. The 400% match bonus up to $10,000 is definitely a great way to get a foothold.</p>
<p>Another great aspect of the casino is its affinity with Real Time Gaming. The developers from RTG have been dropping some pretty amazing titles of late. Given the intuitive Loyalty Program, various bonuses, a constant stream of new slot games, and a brilliant live dealer studio, I feel Las Vegas USA has what it takes to be your new gaming home. Feel free to give it a shot and leave your feedback here.</p>
