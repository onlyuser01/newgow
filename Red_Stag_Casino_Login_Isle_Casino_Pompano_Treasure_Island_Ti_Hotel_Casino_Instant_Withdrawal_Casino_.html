<p>New Rio Las Vegas Owner Says Demolition Rumors False, No Plans for MLB Ballpark</p>

<p>Chatting with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Eric Birnbaum, who is heading Rio’s new ownership entity, known as Dreamscape Companies, says the gossip surrounding the future of the Brazil-themed property has no merit.</p>
<p>Instead, he says Rio’s nearly 90-acre lot along Flamingo Road just west of I-15 is prime to flourish in its new incarnation, whatever that may be.</p>
<p>We’re not doing this blindly, so we obviously have a strategy and an idea as to who our customer is and how we’re going to position the asset,” Birnbaum explained. “It’s a little premature for me to reveal exactly how we’re going to do that and what we’re going to do because we don’t want to spill the beans just yet.”</p>
<p>He concluded, “Suffice it to say that we believe this asset has unbelievable potential.”</p>
<p>MLB Strikeout</p>
<p>Eldorado Resorts, which is in the process of acquiring Caesars Entertainment for $17.3 billion, completed the sale of Rio Las Vegas to Dreamscape this week for $516.3 million. Under the terms, Caesars/Eldorado will continue operating the casino property through a two-year leaseback in exchange for $45 million in annual rent.</p>
<p>That provides Birnbaum plenty of time to decide what to do come late 2021 with the venue.</p>
<p>It was October 2018 when rumblings regarding the Rio potentially being leveled to make way for a Major League Baseball stadium began circulating. The rumor mill gave some sort of reasoning for Station Casinos’ decision to pump more than $1 billion into buying and renovating the Palms Casino Resort, which is just west of Rio.</p>
<p>Could the billionaire Fertitta brothers have known something the rest of Southern Nevada didn’t regarding the Rio becoming the home of a Las Vegas MLB team in the years ahead? No, says Birnbaum.</p>
<p>Caesars Loss</p>
<p>In 1998, Caesars – then known as Harrah’s Entertainment – purchased the Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino from developer Marnell Corrao Associates for $518 million in stock and assumed debt of $303 million, for a total transaction of $821 million.</p>
<p>Eldorado/Caesars’ decision to unload the Rio for $516.3 million represents a 37 percent discount on what Harrah’s paid more than two decades ago.</p>
<p>However, gaming industry analysts have endorsed the decision. “We view the transaction as a distinct positive for Eldorado/Caesars, as it provides for healthy deleverage, while the net transaction multiple, in our view, is very strong,” Deutsche Bank’s Carlo Santarelli said in a note.</p>
<p>Observers have also dished their opinions on what the Rio might morph into under the new ownership.</p>
<p>“We would expect a focus on non-gaming amenities, a potential residential component, and perhaps partnerships with hotel and hospitality brands. We don’t expect a full tear-down, but could see meaningful capital expenditures,” SunTrust Bank’s Barry Jones speculated.</p>
