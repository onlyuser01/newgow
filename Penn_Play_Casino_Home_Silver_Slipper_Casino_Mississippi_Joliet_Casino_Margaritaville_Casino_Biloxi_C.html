<p>Sean Pattwell, executive director of the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, is rumored to be preparing to resign from his position. Sources told ROI-NJ, a news outlet covering events in New Jersey, that the director may depart from the authority very soon.</p>
<p>ROI-NJ was contacted by three separate people on the matter, all of whom preferred to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of the information.</p>
<p>According to the reports, Pattwell may leave by the end of the year, although none of the individuals who contacted ROI-NJ was able to provide an exact date. The people familiar with the matter couldn’t confirm what Pattwell would do next but noted that he would pursue other opportunities.</p>
<p>Pattwell joined the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment Development Authority on April 1 last year, replacing Matt Doherty, the authority’s previous executive director. Before joining the body, he served the insurance industry and spent some time as the co-CEO of Herbert L. Jamison. He is also the founding chair of Grosvenor Brokers.</p>
<p>According to the news outlet’s report, the people familiar with the matter have suggested that Pattwell may now return to the private sector. They also told ROI-NJ that the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment Development Authority is on the lookout for Pattwell’s successor.</p>
<p>At the moment, the authority is still discussing the matter and considering its options. ROI-NJ’s concluded that Pattwell’s successor will ultimately be appointed by Governor Phil Murphy.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s Casino Industry Remains Strong</p>
<p>Speaking of New Jersey, a recent report from the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) highlighted the growth of the local casino industry. According to the regulator, the gambling revenue for October increased to $487.1 million, which represents a 9.3% year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>Year-to-date revenue was also strong, demonstrating the resilience and momentum of the local gambling sector. Casino gaming continued to be the main revenue stream and was responsible for almost half of the total revenue.</p>
<p>A week ago, the Garden State’s gambling regulator forced operators to return $77,000 to underage customers and self-excluded players.</p>
<p>In the meantime, New Jersey continues to discuss the future of smoking at Atlantic City’s casinos. Seeking to revisit old laws that exempt casinos from the indoor smoking prohibition, proponents of the ban claim that the smoke jeopardizes casino workers’ health. However, casino companies are wary of such a measure as they believe that it would undermine their profits.</p>
