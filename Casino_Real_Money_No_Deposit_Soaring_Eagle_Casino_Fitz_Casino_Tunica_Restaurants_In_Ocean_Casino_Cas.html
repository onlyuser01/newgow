    <h1>Casino Real Money No Deposit Soaring Eagle Casino Fitz Casino Tunica Restaurants In Ocean Casino Cas</h1>

<p>Petronela,</p>
<p>I understand that the tickets were a timely issue, this is why I contacted your team multiple times before the raffle. I contacted you via chat, via email and even by phone. My tickets changed twice. You company removed 4 tickets that I already had instead of adding 100 at the time of purchase. Then, after I initially contacted your company my 4 missing tickets reappeared. To me, I understand the computer adjusted the amount incorrectly. Then, someone manually adjusted the amount incorrectly. I understand computers mess up I understand people mess up. What I do not understand is that I was told multiple times it would be fixed. I don't understand why your phone presentative would tell me on the morning of the raffle, the raffle wouldn't take place today and for me to not worry. I don't understand why I would receive an email from your management prior to the draw saying sorry I felt badly about it then not have it fixed. I will attach the email. I was livid. And while I abhor doing this, I find i detest feeling cheated by a casino even more so. It's not right to be in a business of selling chances and not give a patron the chances they paid for or even attempt to correct the issue. Likely your representatives are set on a response system predicated by your policy. Since there was a complaint written and escalated my guess would be that no one bothered to follow through validating the resolution. To me, this is bad management and or lack of care. Either way, I was robbed. I am open to allowing for correction. I know the car draw is over. However, the guy who won took the cash and your giving away 3 more cars in the next 3 months. Your disregard to mention the result of the car draw or your new promotions of raffling the other cars is indicative of the false, unjust and uncaring narrative which I have heard these last couple weeks. I would have hoped on such a public forum your tune would have adjusted to minimally feign the slightest care. However, your response is. Oh sorry it's to late now. Sounds like we messed up but what do you want the casino to do about it? Or did I misinterpret that message? Did you even bother to check my account or the escalated issue and resolution on my account? Did you verify the emails sent or received? Did you bother to see how many times I reached out to online chat? Or do your computers not track all that information? I would reckon they do. I also reckon the sweet lady on the phone who said the draw would not take place on the day it took place was prompted to do so by the account notes from a chat representative who tied to tell me the same thing... You had to gather all the information together from many different places for the draw to occur and it would not be on the day your website posted did you have to go door to door or hand count the tickets? Seriously? Absurd! Who's running this casino? What is your employment process? Are there regulations or standards? Testing? Do you need help in these areas? You know its ok to ask for help when you need it.. Your casino is ok otherwise. Pretty standard. I mean how hard is it to set one up? I would think for anyone in design and tech not to complex to cut and paste. I would guess your upper management is paid handsomely leaving disparagement in your care department personnel. Do you think they appreciate having to field these types of complaints on a script or your hoping thier lack of education or training will leave them unaware of why they are fielding your complaints to begin with? Be creative. Offer a fitting resolution.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Candice.</p>
