    <h1>Silver Edge Casino Casinos Online Usa Casino Murphy North Carolina Santa Fe Casino Las Vegas Indigo</h1>

<p>I created an account on Ice Casino in 2022, if i remember correctly. I have deposited once in a while but never got any good winnings to withdraw. Last week i won a good amount and wanted to withdraw. Then the problems started. First i could not withdraw with mastercard. Then i tried bank account. Screenshots that they asked for got declined and deleted. Lastly i tried a different bank account and got approved. So everything seemed to be ok. Did not try to withdraw again yet. Tried playing some more and increased my winnings a little bit. And all of a sudden my account got blocked mid-game. Balance was 1100+ euros. They are telling me that there is another account with my name and a deposit made from my card. But i have never registered on any casino sites more than once. And always with same email. I only have one email account. I tried asking for details about this other account and they provided me some and promised to deliver other evidence to my email. They also told me that i can get my account back but they will take away all the money on my account.</p>
<p>After that i started to look into that email they provided that was used to create another account with my name. It was mostly dotted out but the beginning seemed familiar. I searched for it a little and found out that this email belongs to my ex-wifes son. We have been divorced for almost 2 years and i havent had any contact with her son since then. I contacted him today and at first he denied everything. But finally admitted that he indeed created that account when i told him that i knew that this is his email. He admitted that he created some accounts with my name and details, but used his own email. And has used my card details to make deposits on some sites. He told me that he took a picture of my card before divorce to use my card details. And used it only for some casinos. Because he knew i played and might not notice these payments. Since i play on casinos regularly for years now i have not noticed any misplaced payments. Many casinos use same payment providers. And it was a long time ago. All of this happened sometime last year and i had no knowledge of any of the accounts that he had created until my account got blocked and i was noticed about multiple accounts. Also the boy says that he has not been on that account since last year. I have never known about or used that account in any way personally.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get my verified account (that i created) and winnings back since i had no knowledge of the other account and i have never seen or been on that other account?</p>
<p>I hope that someone can help me on this matter. If i would have known about him creating accounts. I would have notified them and let them close that account immediately.</p>
