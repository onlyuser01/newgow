<p>Tottenham vs. Manchester United is arguably the most interesting duel of the second round of the 2023-24 Premier League</p>
<p>Tottenham started the season with a 2-2 draw against Brentford on the road in the Spurs’ first game in the post-Harry Kane era. Their second game is on the program this coming Saturday when they welcome Manchester United at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>

<p>How Good is Tottenham’s Offense Without Kane?</p>
<p>Harry Kane, who was Tottenham’s talisman for ages has moved to Bayern Munich. In their first game without their former captain, the Spurs played 2-2 with Brentford on the road, with both of their goals scored by defenders – Emerson Royal and Cristian Romero. Romero was the one to score the game opener, but he picked up an injury just three minutes after scoring.</p>
<p>Richarlison, Heung-Min Son, and Dejan Kulusevski were in the front three, with ex-Leicester playmaker James Maddison just behind them. Maddison had a brilliant debut, making two assists and controlling everything throughout the 90 minutes.</p>
<p>However, the question is whether he’ll be able to repeat that in the game against Manchester United, which is a team with a much better midfield than Brentford.</p>
<p>The Red Devils Need to Up Their Game ASAP</p>
<p>In the opening round of the 2023-24 Premier League, Manchester United beat Wolves 1-0 at Old Trafford, but the Red Devils weren’t the better team. Instead, Wolves created way more goal chances and were even robbed of a penalty when Man United’s goalie Andre Onana clattered one of their players in the penalty box. However, the ref didn’t award the penalty and VAR remained silent.</p>
<p>Speaking of Onana, he was his team’s arguably best player in the first round. Man United’s defenders Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Raphael Varane (who scored Man United’s only goal) also did a fine job last weekend, but the rest of the team did not impress.</p>
<p>Tottenham vs. Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>In the first round, neither Tottenham nor Manchester United did well offensively. Their goals were scored by defenders, who also executed their defensive duties very well. That said, we expect these two EPL heavyweights to perform well defensively once again, meaning that we probably aren’t going to see too many goals on Saturday.</p>
<p>However, we do believe at least one of these teams will find the net. After all, there hasn’t been a goalless draw in Tottenham vs. Man United duels since 2014. So which team is more likely to score? We think it’s Manchester United.</p>
<p>The midfielders and attackers of the Red Devils were unimpressive in their first game of the season, but they definitely have the quality to do much better.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester United to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
