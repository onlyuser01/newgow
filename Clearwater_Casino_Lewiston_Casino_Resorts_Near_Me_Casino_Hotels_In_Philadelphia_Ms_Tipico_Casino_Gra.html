    <h1>Clearwater Casino Lewiston Casino Resorts Near Me Casino Hotels In Philadelphia Ms Tipico Casino Gra</h1>

<p>Hello, I've been waiting for the following payout since October 11, 2022:</p>
<p>DATE: 11-10-2022 07:59:14 AM</p>
<p>TNX ID: 207908</p>
<p>TYPE: Payout</p>
<p>STATUS: Requested</p>
<p>PAYMENT: Generic</p>
<p>AMOUNT: 90</p>
<p>CURRENCY: €</p>
<p>TRACE ID: --</p>
<p>The payout amount consists of a free spins bonus without deposit with a max. payout amount of €65 and a Bitcoin deposit of the equivalent of €25. The deposit of 25 euros was my first deposit and requirement to cash out the winnings of the free spins bonus. I have fulfilled the turnover requirements of the bonus and my deposit was made deliberately without using a deposit bonus and was only used to verify the means of payment so that I can initiate the payout and no additional turnover conditions are added.</p>
<p>I have already made several attempts to ask why the withdrawal request is not being processed via live chat. On the first and second try, I was promised that every single cent would be paid out and the support agent wanted to take care of the matter personally, but this is standard wording because it is now promised to me again in every communication . Then at the beginning of November, on my third attempt in the chat, where I wasn't so easily shaken off, I was told that my KYC documents were not complete and if that was the case, my request would be processed immediately. I submitted this immediately afterwards, but I did not receive any confirmation of the status of the KYC process and the withdrawal has still not been processed. There was no response at all to my last two requests in the chat. Since this casino doesn't send logs of chat conversations, I can't upload any other attachments either.</p>
<p>Thank you for your efforts. Regards Daniel M***</p>
