    <h1>Saganing Casino Who Owns Hard Rock Casino St Croix Casino Danbury Rush Casino Free Spins No Deposit</h1>

<p>Hello, some kind of devilry happened, I played on this site, took advantage of the second deposit bonus and made a deposit in the amount of 8,000 UAH. + I was credited with a bonus of 12,000 UAH and the total amount was 20,000 UAH. The most interesting thing is that if you use the bonus, then it is impossible to withdraw funds until it is wagered. I had to wager 540,000 UAH, my personal 8,000 UAH were blocked by the bonus. And now I will successfully play it back and there were 57,000 UAH on the balance sheet. From this amount, 37,000 UAH was deducted from me and left on the balance sheet the same amount that was originally from the replenishment. I contacted the chat, and they answered me that according to the rule clause 17.3, the maximum withdrawal from the bonus is 2.5. And now look at the first paragraph of the rules 17.3 on the site there is no such information at all in the bonus conditions. And thirdly, well, even if the cash out is 2.5 of the bonus amount, 50,000 UAH should remain on the account. But they wrote to me in the chat the amount of my amount which I bet 8000 UAH and now from it 2.5 = 20,000 UAH. Well, a clear deception, and the amount of the bonus is up to the amount of the deposit. And there is no this item in the rules, earlier at the first withdrawal and wagering there were no such problems, but it was such that the site blocked the account accusing me of duplicating the account, and after I proved that I had not previously registered it was unblocked and the money was withdrawn. Well, now the situation is again unclear. They lie insolently poking a rule clause which does not exist at all, I have a screenshot of what they wrote, you check where there is a given rule clause to which they supposedly refer to it does not exist at all. It turns out that the site, without any reason, violating the rules of their own rules, wrote off 37,000 UAH of my honest winnings. Please take immediate action! I had the right to withdraw all 57,000 UAH. And not 20,000 UAH. Especially if you even take my deposit and the bonus amount is 20,000. ×2.5=50,000 UAH why they calculated 2.5 from the deposit amount, I don’t understand at all if it was not possible to withdraw them; They do what they want.</p>
