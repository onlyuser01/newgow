    <h1>Casino Jack Las Vegas Casinos On The Strip Rincon Casino In San Diego Hi5 Casino Virginia Beach Casi</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this casino is using their Free spins policy unfairly, I will try to explain the situation as short as possible, even though it is complex to keep up with the continuation of events. I will try to put events in the numerical order.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I deposited 100 EUR to my account on 2023-10-17. I played Temple Tumble game and was very lucky, so at the end of the session I won 1154,13 EUR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I requested two separate withdrawals: 1000 EUR and 154 EUR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I decided to use the Loyalty Free Spins promotion, 100 spins on The Golden Owl of Athena (Note, these are not no-deposit free spins, because you actually have to deposit funds and play a lot in order to gather points and get the spins ). At the end of that session I had 21,73 EUR (I won 21,60 EUR+0,13 EUR my own balance).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I kept on playing with the funds in game Temple Tumble. I was once again lucky and at the end of the session I had 313,08 EUR in my balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the important one: I cancelled my withdrawal request of 154 EUR (which I won from 100 EUR deposit from my own funds) and requested for 467 EUR withdrawal .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 2023-10-18, way after the 24 hour timeframe of withdrawals in this casino I contacted them regarding my withdrawal, live chat said that I should receive my winnings soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I decided to try my luck and cancelled the 467 EUR withdrawal and started playing again in Temple Tumble. Note, I never went over to the so called ‘bonus’ part of the balance (lowest balance was 354,04 EUR while playing, so my own funds did not go away at any point).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the very end of the session my total balance was 2962 EUR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I requested three separate withdrawals of 1000 EUR, 1000 EUR and 962 EUR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I only received withdrawal of 1000 EUR requested on 2023-10-17.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All three withdrawals (in the amount of 2962 EUR were forfeited). Making the total balance from 2962 EUR to 50 EUR (so called maximum withdrawal amount from non-deposit free spins).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The correct way should have been to forfeit 262,95 EUR (312,95 EUR (winnings from the Loyalty free spins) – 50 EUR (maximum withdrawal limit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, closing balance should have been 2699,05 EUR.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, to sum up: I had positive balance before the Loyalty Spins , I also used my funds to win and never went past the line of my own funds, so bonus amount was never actually used to make the winnings.</p>
<p>Besides of all the mentioned things, withdrawal was late according to Terms and Conditions, there is no mention of Loyalty Spins having maximum withdrawal amount of 50 EUR (these are not no-deposit Free spins as I have mentioned above).</p>
<p>You can clearly see from all the information provided that my own funds were used to win this amount and not the bonus money, therefore funds should not have been forfeited.</p>
<p>If any additional information or snips are needed, please contact me, I have all the information. I also contacted the casino regarding this issue and they are sticking with the 50 EUR maximum withdrawal rule, so I did not manage to settle this with them.</p>
