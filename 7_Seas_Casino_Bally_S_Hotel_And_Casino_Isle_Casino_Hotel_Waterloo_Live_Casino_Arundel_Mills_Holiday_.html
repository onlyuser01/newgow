<p>UPDATE: Savannah Henderson claims authorities dropped charges against her for a shooting at Nevada’s Moonlite Bunny Ranch. But the Lyon County Sheriff’s Department told the New York Post this week that the charges have not been dropped.</p>
<p>EARLIER: The reputed sex worker who was arrested early Tuesday after a shooting spree and multihour standoff with cops at Nevada’s Moonlite Bunny Ranch is now claiming she is innocent of the violent charges.</p>

<p>Savannah Henderson, 28, of Dayton, Nev., proclaimed on her Twitter account at about 10 p.m. PT Tuesday that charges against her were dropped and that she was “falsely accused.”</p>
<p>Henderson revealed her status in a tweet to her many followers: “I’m free to walk and roam!” Her claims that charges against her were dropped couldn’t be immediately confirmed by Casino.org.</p>
<p>Henderson allegedly repeatedly fired a gun in the Mound House, Nev. legal brothel at about 9:30 p.m. on Monday. She then hid inside a nearby room. She voluntarily surrendered to cops at about 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday. Officers had tried to negotiate with her for about three hours as she stayed inside the reportedly locked room.</p>

<p>Henderson was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of a controlled substance, discharging a firearm where others may be endangered, and obstructing/resisting a peace officer, according to news reports. She said in a tweet she uses “weed” — an apparent reference to marijuana.</p>
<p>A short time after her surrender, she was booked at Nevada’s Lyon County Jail.</p>
<p>She was released later on Tuesday after posting an $86,140 bond, the New York Post reported. She said in a tweet she paid the bond “immediately.”</p>
<p>After she got out of jail, Henderson tweeted, “y’all thought you got me lol.”</p>
<p>Lyon County Sheriff’s Office deputies and officers from multiple departments — as well as Nevada state troopers and a SWAT team — responded to the crime scene. So, too, did EMTs.</p>
<p>The initial incident may have been linked to a dispute between two workers at the brothel, according to information provided to the sheriff’s office by brothel management.</p>
<p>No one was injured by the gunfire, and it’s unclear if the brothel was damaged by bullets. The commotion forced the brothel’s evacuation for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The Moonlite Bunny Ranch is located some six miles east of Carson City, Nev. It opened in 1955 and was formerly owned by Dennis Hof, who died in 2018.</p>

<p>Henderson is repeatedly described as a sex worker in media reports. She also reportedly appeared on the March 2019 cover of Hustler magazine. Professionally, she is known as “Tiara Tae,” “The Mean Girl,” and “Bully Barbie.”</p>
<p>On her personal website, Henderson describes herself “As a tall, blonde buxom woman that literally exudes sensuality.”</p>
<p>Former Colleague Calls Her a Bully</p>
<p>One self-described former Moonlite Bunny Ranch worker, Alexa Haze, said on Twitter that Henderson is a “Crazy bully barbie bitch arrested for shooting at another co-worker. The total f****ng nutcase.”</p>
<p>Bullied other ladies for years. Attacked other,” Haze said. “I witnessed when i worked there. Crazy bitch was never dealt with by management.”</p>
<p>Henderson’s professional profile on the ranch’s website was removed on Tuesday, the UK’s DailyMail.com reported. Since her arrest, Henderson has received extensive attention in the media and online.</p>
