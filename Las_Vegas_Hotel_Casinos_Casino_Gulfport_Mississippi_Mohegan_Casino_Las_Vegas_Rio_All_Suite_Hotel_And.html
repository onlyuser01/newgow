<p>The changes further elevate the premium live casino content supplier’s commitment to the vertical and introduce a significantly modernized and enhanced experience to players. The new lobby is focused on personalization and tailored experiences.</p>
<p>Making Things Intuitive on the Go</p>
<p>The new lobby allows players to quickly get a scoop on all the games that are there and read up on all relevant information intuitively and quickly. By hovering over a tile, an overlay will open and start streaming a video from the game to players, so that they are immediately immersed in the gaming environment and can get a better understanding of what awaits.</p>
<p>The user interface has also enjoyed a number of upgrades to make it more intuitive and functional. Players can see the seat occupancy along with other information again by simply hovering over a title. There is also a bet-behind option for select games that are at capacity.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live Game Lobby also features a few other quality-of-life improvements such as the My Favorite section to list all the games you want to play now or save for later. All of this contributes to smoother navigation across the entire lobby and makes it much easier for players to discover what they want to play whether they game on their desktop devices or smartphones.</p>
<p>Players can switch between different tabs and windows in the lobby and use shortcuts such as “Back to Game” when they leave a game to plunge back into the action at a moment’s notice. The balance is now made easier to follow and is placed in the top corner of the screen and set out from the rest.</p>
<p>Letting Operators Customize as Much as They Like</p>
<p>Apart from making sure that players are having a better time, the new lobby has been also designed to be more flexible for operators. Operators can now use the interactive lobby banner to display up to three games and add various images and video files to make their own offering more worthwhile and entertaining.</p>
<p>With a great customization value for both the player and operators, Stakelogic Live’s new Live Game Lobby is a great continuation of the company’s commitment to delivering the best live casino experience possible. Stakelogic Live has been working with several companies to power their live offerings, including Aspire Global Partner and Circus.</p>
