    <h1>Casinos In Montana Usa Online Casino Real Money Paypal Atlantis Bahamas Casino Casino Tucson Sandia</h1>

<p>Have previously had an account with this casino. In several emails in July, I informed the casino that I am a resident of Sweden. The casino then informed me that my account would be permanently closed after what I had informed them about because as a "Swedish citizen" you are not allowed to play at this casino by law. I was still able to open my account some time later without any problems, but for some reason I got a discount on deposits, which probably was because I just should not be allowed to play at this casino. I then choose to play at another casino but return later (about a week ago) to play and then it is easy to deposit money and play. I obviously lose my money and then contact the chat support to close my account (I have gambling problems and then choose to close my accounts every time I lose to simply not waste all my money) and then the same process as last time which makes me think about when I recognize this late. After going through my email account to find previous communication with the casino, I find that my account would already have been permanently closed because I wanted this + that I am a resident and hold a Swedish citizenship. I then contact the casino to ask them how it was possible for me to log in and deposit money and play them when my account was closed and I receive in response that I registered that I live in Norway and therefore have it was possible. What is important is that I clearly stated on July 8 that I am a resident and hold a Swedish citizenship, which means that my account would then switch status to a Swedish account and thus automatically close permanently but the casino itself makes the mistake only to close the account without permanent status, and it is never stated in the closing that I have thus stated that I am a resident of Sweden and hold a Swedish citizenship. I have tried to get the casino to take responsibility for them handling this incorrectly as it would not have been possible for me to log in, deposit money and play for them because my account would have been inaccessible to me when it would have been permanently closed. I have requested that someone look at the matter as there are obviously deficiencies in the routines of the casino that have now made this matter handled incorrectly on their part and I want this to be noticed and that the casino takes responsibility for how they incorrectly handled the case!</p>
