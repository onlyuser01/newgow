<p>Altenar, a B2B provider of sports betting and iGaming solutions, continues on a path to further expansion, as the company has now confirmed that it will be working with Palms Bet in Bulgaria, part of the company’s efforts to further scale its global footprint and consolidate its presence in lucrative markets, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release. This partnership is building on a similar collaboration between the companies in Kenya.</p>
<p>Bulgaria’s iGaming and betting landscapes have been fast-evolving with numerous operators and suppliers entering the country over the past months, marking the increased interest in gambling products locally. Now, Altenar has the opportunity to expand its offer in the country as well, partnering with a trusted regional operator.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, Palms Bet will get access to Altenar’s state-of-the-art and multi-channel sports betting tech and platform, offering a range of verticals and markets, including traditional sports, competitive video gaming, and virtual sports.</p>
<p>Palms Bet presently offers more than 20,000 sporting events, making it one of the most significant players on the market as it stands. The deal has been welcomed by both representatives of Palms Bet and Altenar who saw value in this move.</p>
<p>Altenar Account Manager George Mavridis added that Bulgaria is now a significant part of his company’s further growth strategy, and he said that after achieving successes in countries such as Peru and Kenya, the Balkan nation was next on Altenar’s list of priorities.</p>
<p>"We look forward to helping our partners maximize their customer engagement, as well as continued expansion alongside Palms Bet," Mavridis said.</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Palms Bet Chief Sports Betting Officer Alexander Sjarov who saw in this collaboration yet another opportunity for his company to strengthen its presence locally and provide players with elevated experiences.</p>
<p>Over the last months, Altenar has formed a number of alliances in Bulgaria, including with companies such as BetMarket, Alphawin, and 8888. Besides its growth in Bulgaria, however, the B2B company has been focused on strengthening its foothold in other jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p>This has led to a partnership with MiCasino in Latin America and another important market entry in Germany with ChillyBets. On balance, Altenar has been able to become a true globe-trotter, providing its products and content where it is needed globally.</p>
