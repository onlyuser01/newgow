<p>International Game Technology PLC (IGT) has announced that IGT PlayDigital expanded its partnership with SKS365 Group. The multi-year agreement will result in extra content for the Italian market via SKS365 Group’s Planetwin365 casino.</p>
<p>Planetwin365 Will Use the IGT PlayDigital RGS</p>
<p>As a way to provide Italian players with more PlayCasino titles, Planetwin365 will use the remote game server (RGS) of IGT PlayDigital. Troy Cox, the CCO of SKS365 Group, shared a few words on the new partnership.</p>
<p>He said that registered players at Planetwin365 will gain access to “world-class content” thanks to IGT PlayDigital’s entertaining games and the company’s broad knowledge of the Italian market. Cox noted that as a way to grow Planetwin365’s brand, new PlayCasino games and promotions will be released each month.</p>
<p>Gil Rotem, the president of iGaming at IGT, also shared a few words on the partnership. He stated that the multi-year agreement will combine “two powerhouse gaming companies” and thanks to the fact that these companies are deep-rooted in Italy, players at Planetwin365 will be provided with a unique gaming experience.</p>
<p>Apart from the already-existing player-favorite games such as Cash Eruption, Cleopatra and The Big Easy, Planetwin365 plans to incorporate 30 additional titles by IGT in the next 2 months. Apart from IGT’s well-known slots, Planetwin365’s portfolio will be boosted with video poker games.</p>
<p>IGT Continues to Expand Its Presence Across the US</p>
<p>IGT’s mission to expand across the US proved to be quite successful in the recent period. At the end of August, the company announced that it expanded its partnership with the New York Lottery and noted that the two parties will work together until 2026.</p>
<p>A month before IGT expanded its partnership with the NY Lottery, it announced that its partner portfolio will also feature the Michigan Lottery. With this partnership, IGT will help the Michigan Lottery grow by providing it with its eInstant products.</p>
<p>Although the second quarter showed some decline for the company, IGT’s players did not suffer any blowback. Recently, IGT released a report which stated that in July, players won around $10 million in jackpots.</p>
<p>The Powerbucks, Wheel of Fortune and Megabucks slots handed 7 jackpots massive jackpots in July. The first jackpot was won on July 4, when a lucky player at Graton Resort &amp; Casino in Rohnert Park, California won $3,603,575 by playing Megabucks.</p>
<p>Four days later, a $1,431,303 jackpot was won at Grand Sierra Resort and Casino in Reno, Nevada by a player who enjoyed Wheel of Fortune Triple Red Hot 7’s.</p>
<p>Since the inception of IGT’s Megabucks slots in 1986s, the total jackpots that were rewarded to players exceeded $1 billion. Wheel of Fortune slots alone created more than a thousand millionaires, according to IGT’s report.</p>
