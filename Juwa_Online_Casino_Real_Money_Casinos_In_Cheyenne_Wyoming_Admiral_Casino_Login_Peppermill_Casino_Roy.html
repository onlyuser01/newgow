<p>This coming Saturday, St. Louis City will try to win their fourth game in their maiden MLS season. It won’t be easy for their plan to come true as they’re taking on the always-tricky San Jose Earthquakes in round 4</p>
<p>St. Louis City is the only team in the 2023 MLS that has a 100% record after three rounds. The new franchise has been brilliant in the offense, scoring 8 goals in three games. The big question is whether they can continue their scoring spree this Saturday when they’re taking on a team that’s conceded just three goals thus far in 2023.</p>

<p>Confidence is Sky-High in St. Louis</p>
<p>They started their first MLS season in top gear, defeating Austin FC 3-2 in an away game in the first round. Then, in their first-ever home game in the top US soccer league, they defeated Charlotte 3-1. Finally, in their most recent game, St. Louis City beat the Portland Timers 2-1 on the road.</p>
<p>Their strongest weapon has been their team spirit, which is kind of surprising considering that most of their key men have only arrived in St. Louis a few months ago.</p>
<p>There isn’t a big star on this roster, but several of St. Louis’ men are playing on an MVP level. In fact, there are three St. Louis players who have scored two goals so far, with another two scoring one each.</p>
<p>San Jose Earthquakes are Doing (Surprisingly) Well in 2023</p>
<p>The San Jose Earthquakes are 2-0-1 in 2023, which is actually a great achievement for the team that finished bottom of the Western Conference last season. They did start the 2023 campaign with a loss, but it happened against one of the richest clubs in the league, Atlanta United. The boys from Georgia beat them 2-1 in Atlanta.</p>
<p>The Quakes then went to San Jose, where they won against the Vancouver Whitecaps 2-1 and the Colorado Rapids 1-0. After two home games, they hit the road again, which is something that needs to concern them. It’s because they’re famously bad in away matches, winning just one league game on the road in 2022.</p>
<p>St. Louis City vs San Jose Earthquakes Prediction</p>
<p>Everything is going in St. Louis City’s favor ahead of the game with the San Jose Earthquakes. They’re in top form, playing in front of their fans against a team that’s horrible on the road. That said, anything but a convincing home win would be a major surprise.</p>
<p>Pick: St. Louis City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
