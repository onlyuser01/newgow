<p>The leading award-winning innovative fantasy sports software provider for the iGaming and sports betting industry, Fantasy Sports Interactive (FSI), announced it launched a fantasy sports solution in collaboration with Fantazzie Gaming Technologies (Fantazzie Oyun Teknolojileri A.Ş) for customers in Turkey.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration announced Monday, the duo joins forces to offer a Fantasy Sports platform. The innovative platform will feature weekly fantasy contests and free-to-play options. What's more, the platform will support in-app purchases as well.</p>
<p>In a statement released on October 3, 2022, FSI's CEO, Dennis Tsalikis, said: "We are thrilled to bring Fantazzie’s platform and vision to life, and we are proud to provide this engaging fantasy solution to the passionate football fans of Turkey!" He explained that FSI enjoys collaborating with the dedicated team of professionals at Fantazzie A.Ş. In conclusion, Tsalikis said that the company is looking forward to continuing its successful collaboration with Fantazzie.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fantazzie soft-launched its mobile app and website just in time for the start of the 2022-2023 Turkish Süper Lig Season. The company offered Fantasy Süper Lig Contests and its app proved to be well received by bettors in Turkey. In fact, in less than two months after the launch, the Fantazzie App hit fourth place on the Google Play store and first place on the iOS App store for mobile apps in the country.</p>
<p>Focused on Süper Lig Clubs, Fantazzie's mobile app offers an immersive experience by featuring photos of the players as well as official team logos. What's more, sports fans that use the app can customize their interface and enjoy unique gameplay functionalities. One such functionality is called entry boosters. This functionality allows the users to receive an in-app currency called "FanGold." According to Fantazzie, by using FanGold, sports fans can "boost their entries, team, or even specific athletes, and win extra Fantasy Points to beat the opponent Managers on the Leaderboard."</p>
<p>After the successful launch of the new platform, Fantazzie A.Ş revealed a new marketing campaign engaging with the sports fans in Turkey. Promoted via different digital channels of the clubs from the Süper Lig, the exciting campaign promises to award a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4.</p>
<p>But it's not only the Süper Lig that FSI and Fantazzie will collaborate for. Using the positive momentum, the duo will join forces for one of the most anticipated and prestigious upcoming soccer competitions in the world, the World Cup.</p>
