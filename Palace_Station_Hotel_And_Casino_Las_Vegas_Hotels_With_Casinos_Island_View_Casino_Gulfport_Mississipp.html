<p>With the year almost out, Octoplay definitely has another last-minute reason to celebrate, as the company has cleared the licensure process to enter Ontario’s iGaming market and deploy its innovative and out-of-the-box casino titles on the local market.</p>
<p>The company confirmed the news on LinkedIn and said that it has cleared the regulatory process as outlined by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). Moving forward, Octoplay may collaborate with local operators and seek to introduce its games to any established local entity.</p>
<p>The AGCO license is a significant step forward in Octoplay’s establishment as a leading supplier, and a huge boost to its geographical reach at a time of fast internal production pace. Octoplay will be able to debut some of its most notable titles to date on the local market, among which are Pearly Shores, Bullet Bonanza, and Lolicat.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable step forward for the company as it has expanded beyond its stomping grounds in Europe where it’s licensed by the UK Gambling Commission, the Malta Gaming Authority, and Spelinspektionen.</p>
<p>Commenting on the success, Octoplay Commercial Director Nick Vuchev said that the supplier’s games are of the highest quality and that they were ready to take on international markets.</p>
<p>"It’s no surprise that operators want to stock our titles, and that’s why we are working hard to secure licenses and approvals in all regulated markets," Vuchev added beaming confidence. He said that the Ontario license is a major step forward in realizing the company’s ambitions of establishing itself firmly in markets beyond Europe.</p>
<p>Octoplay Legal Director Martina Borg Stevens also chimed in and hailed the watershed moment for the company saying that it bore incredible significance and was a clear testament to the quality and hard work Octoplay had been putting in.</p>
<p>"To be awarded a license from such a prestigious regulator makes us feel incredibly proud and establishes a strong foothold in the North American market, which we look forward to building upon," Stevens added assured of the future success of her company in the fast-developing iGaming market in Ontario.</p>
<p>Octoplay has similarly moved to other markets in Europe, as the company obtained an iGaming license from the Romanian Gaming Authority as well in December.</p>
