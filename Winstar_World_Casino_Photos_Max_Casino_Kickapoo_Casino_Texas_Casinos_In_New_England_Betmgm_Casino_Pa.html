<p>Following the success of the 2021 Britannia Stakes fundraising that helped raise £1.25 million ($1.52 million) for a number of charities, the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) decided to celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee in a similar manner. BGC members have chosen to pledge all profits from the heritage handicap at Royal Ascot to some of the most important charities in the UK. Provided the race will not generate any profits, the operators have all agreed to make a donation.</p>
<p>Who Are the Beneficiaries?</p>
<p>Established in 2019, the Betting and Gaming Council in the UK encompasses more than 90% of all land betting shops, online gaming and sports betting, bingo and casino operators. The body is responsible for driving regulatory standards that promote a safe and fair experience for all players. The list of BGC members is long and includes a number of prestigious operators in the industry. This year, the following members have agreed to pledge a donation in celebration of the Queen’s jubilee: Entain, William Hill, bet365, Flutter, bet365, Betway Rank Group, Kindred, BetVictor, Bet With Ascot, Tote, Virgin Bet, and Fitzdares.</p>
<p>The race will be held on June 16, on the third day of the Royal Ascot event that will begin on June 14, right after the Gold Cup. Ascot Racecourse Supports Community Fund, ABF The Soldiers’ Charity, The Ivors Academy, Cotswold Riding for the Disabled, and Sue Ryder will all benefit from the generous donation. The funds will come from the win and each-way single bets placed with the operators after all duties and levy will be deducted. Last year, the victory of 18/1 shot Peretto brought a share of the £1.25 million ($1.52 million) profits to Marie Curie, Prostate Cancer UK, Care radio, and three charities belonging to the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>BGC “Absolutely Delighted” About the New Fundraiser</p>
<p>Using the voice of chief executive Michael Dugher, BGC expressed its delight about its most important members being involved in another fundraiser that will support the most prestigious charities in the UK. He also emphasized the importance of this year’s race in the context of the Queen’s Jubilee, given Her Majesty’s passion for horseracing.</p>
<p>Ascot Racecourse’s managing director Alastair Warwick called the fundraiser a “fantastic initiative,“ adding his belief that the money will reach some “extremely worthwhile causes.“ ABF The Soldiers’ Charity for Berkshire also thanked members of the BGC for their support in 2021 and for their decision to repeat their donation during this year’s Royal Ascot. ABF The Soldiers’ Charity is the army’s national charity. In 2021, it supported more than 60,000 people located in 60+ countries.</p>
<p>The Ivors Academy Trust used the voice of Cliff Fluet to express its thrill about being selected to benefit from a donation via the Britannia Stakes race for the first time in history.</p>
<p>Sue Ryder’s director of fundraising, Caroline Graham, added that Her Majesty the Queen has been the foundation’s patron for almost three decades. Graham also stated that the donation will be used to offer neurological, palliative, and bereavement assistance to a larger number of individuals.</p>
