<p>Arizona and California have proven seductive markets for Kindred Group which has signed activation deals with the Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation to gain an early entry into the states.</p>
<p>Unibet Parent Company Seeks out Arizona and California as Gambling Markets</p>
<p>Kindred Group is expanding its clout in the United States and particularly in California and Arizona through an activation deal with the Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation.</p>
<p>Looking to empower operators across the entire US market, Kindred is capable of deploying advanced online gambling solutions that power numerous partners across the country and in states such as Pennsylvania, Indiana and New Jersey, generally considered some of the biggest in terms of net iGaming and sports betting potential.</p>
<p>Now, Kindred is looking to secure access for Unibet, the company’s flagship sportsbook, in two new markets that are not quite there in terms of legalization, but just as the rest of the US, are pushing towards more acclimated regulatory statures.</p>
<p>The deal signed between Kindred and the Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation will run for a period of ten years with the option to expand the partnership if both parties are happy with the direction of the partnership.</p>
<p>The agreement covers both mobile as well as retail sports betting, subject to regulatory approval. Kindred Group SVP of US Manuel Stan has welcomed the partnership and confirmed that the deal enables the company to pursue further business developments in two states that offer untapped potential.</p>
<p>Arizona and California Hold Tremendous Potential Says Kindred</p>
<p>According to Stan, California is tipped to be one of the largest markets worldwide, with the projected revenue on yearly basis reaching $2 billion. Arizona, on the other hand, is estimated to generate $200 million, should all go according to plan and regulation is rolled out for both retail and mobile sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Gaining an early access is important, says Stan, and particularly so when it’s been established with a “great partner.” With legalization in neither state not making much of a progress right now, Kindred will have to wait for at least another year in both places.</p>
<p>Yet, Quechan Tribe president Jordan Joaquin is convinced that the partnership with Kindred is the right move forward and lead to exciting opportunities as well as public revenue in future.</p>
