    <h1>Ladbrokes Casino Live Casino Social Casino In Denver Casino In Ca Tennessee Casinos Diamond Reels Ca</h1>

<p>Played their no deposit promo, made it through the rollover, but before trying to with draw I messages customer service to ask them to check my account for anything that would hinder me from receiving my withdraw, because in order to withdraw you must first deposit $35 and play through it 1 time, and didn't want to make the deposit if they had any discrepancies. Customer service was extremely rude, refused to answer my questions,and just kept repeating, "first make the $35 deposit, then we'll look for discrepancies". Which that sounds suspect already... I requested the transcripts from our conversation but they were never sent. But here's the real crazy part... if you read their t&amp;c, it states they have the right to keep your money and ban you if you have a felony, and that you're giving them permission to permanently take any and all of your money in your account, whether it be deposit or bonus money, for ANY reason they see fit, without giving you a reason why. I've read the t&amp;c for over 50 online casinos and I've never seen one that said that before.</p>
<p>Anyhow, apparently they ran a background check on me without my permission, found out I have a felony DUI, and used that as theire excuse to keep my winnings and ban me from their site. This is probably the most suspect, sketchiest casino I've run in to so far. Definitely would never invest my hard earned money there,especially after reading their t&amp;c...Be safe, folks.</p>
