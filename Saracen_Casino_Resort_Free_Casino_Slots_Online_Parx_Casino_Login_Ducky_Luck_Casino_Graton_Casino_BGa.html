<p>A New Deal Brings BGaming Social Content for SpinArena Customers</p>
<p>Thanks to the collaboration, BGaming expanded further its presence within the social casino space. Ousley Games is a cross-platform gaming service that caters to millions of players globally. An innovative solution dubbed “seriOUSLY1.0” serving as the company’s backend sets new technological standards and really makes a difference within the industry. Ousley’s flagship brand is called SpinArena and it is currently one of the biggest European social casinos.</p>
<p>Under the deal, popular slots such as Elvis Frog in Vegas, Bonanza Billion, Aloha King Elvis and others are available for free for SpinArena players. Moreover, the new collaboration complements BGaming’s strategic growth efforts in the social casino market. The company announced that this strategy will continue next year as it will connect to more social casinos.</p>
<p>The Company Is Delighted to Join Forces with Ousley Games</p>
<p>BGaming’s head of the BizDev department, Alexandr Shavel acknowledged that the company is delighted to join forces with a reputable company such as Ousley Games. Additionally, he said that BGaming is proud to integrate with both social casinos and classic online projects.</p>
<p>“We are very proud that we integrate not only classic online projects but also social casinos.” Alexandr Shavel, head of BizDev department at BGaming</p>
<p>According to Shavel, integrating with more partners is a key part of the company’s business development strategy.

<p>Commenting on the recent deal, Ousley Games’ CMO, Jochen Martinez, added that BGaming’s content fits well with Ousley’s high-quality portfolio of slots available for customers of SpinArena.</p>
