<p>Las Vegas Keeps Getting More Expensive, Fees Now Applied to Drinks</p>

<p>Las Vegas casinos keep becoming more expensive to visit, as service fees on drinks are now being incurred by guests at Strip resort properties.</p>

<p>First reported by Vital Vegas, a recent guest at Park MGM questioned why his two drinks at the Mama Rabbit Mezcal and Tequila Bar came with a service charge. The bill – totaling $38.00 – increased to $43.04 after $3.14 sales tax and an ambiguous $1.90 service charge.</p>
<p>Another guest – under the Twitter handle “NotFromConcentrate” – noticed he, too, incurred such random charges at Park MGM. He reached out to MGM Resorts for an explanation.</p>
<p>This charge you’re seeing is a venue fee,” the casino operator explained. “It is not only applied for table service, but for bar service as well, and is being applied to every check in the venue.”</p>
<p>“This fee is applied to all things that keep the venue operationally running, like the gaming maintenance for all bar top games, Wi-Fi, lounge maintenance,” MGM added.</p>
<p>Fees Galore</p>
<p>Las Vegas is becoming the fee capital of the world. Casinos began eliminating free parking in recent years – a perk that had been afforded to visitors of all tier levels for decades. Resort fees continue to climb, Park MGM currently at $37 a day.</p>
<p>According to the Park MGM website, the resort fee covers “property-wide high speed internet access (public spaces and in-room), unlimited local and toll free calls, airline boarding pass printing, and fitness center access for guests 18+.”</p>
<p>It’s not just MGM that’s in on the fee game.</p>
<p>Sahara Las Vegas, which returned to the Strip last week after a disastrous run as SLS Las Vegas, is also charging a service fee at its bars. A receipt from The Foundry shared to Twitter shows a $14.00 cocktail ballooning to $16.80 after a mandatory 15 percent gratuity and five percent service charge.</p>
<p>Daily resort fees are now as high as $45 a day – the going rate at luxury properties, including the Bellagio, Aria, Vdara, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, and Encore.</p>
<p>The charges are the subject of two lawsuits filed by the attorney general for the District of Columbia and Nebraska. The complaints allege resort fees are a form of “drip pricing” where online retailers advertise one price, and then incrementally increase the cost through mandatory surcharges.</p>
<p>Visitor Backlash</p>
<p>Following the October 2017 mass shooting, Las Vegas pleaded with visitors to continue supporting the gaming mecca. MGM CEO Jim Murren said, “Without you, they [casino and hotel staff] don’t have a job. You are coming here supporting this destination and helping those families take care of themselves.”</p>
<p>But then many Las Vegas Strip casinos eliminated free parking and jacked up resort fees.</p>
<p>On Twitter, users are outraged at the newest fees to invade Sin City.</p>
<p>This whole fee thing has gotten ridiculous. They are making people angry and killing the golden goose. Very greedy and stupid,” one user said.</p>
<p>Another explained, “I was joking when I suggested a toilet flush fee, an air conditioning fee, a housekeeping fee, a towel fee, quadruple zero roulette fee, pool lounge chair fee, casino admission fee, an hourly slot machine fee.”</p>
