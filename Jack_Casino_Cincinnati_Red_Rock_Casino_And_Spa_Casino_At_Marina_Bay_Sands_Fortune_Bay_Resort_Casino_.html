<p>Big Time Gaming’s Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Megapays has lived up to its name making one lucky player a winner. Integrated with the Relax Gaming gaming aggregator, BTG’s title was able to pay out the eye-watering €1,036,049.65 (around $1.2 million) off a €0.70 bet (around $0.80).</p>
<p>Commenting on this accomplishment, BTG CEO Nick Robinson praised how Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Megapays has been able to forge real millionaires out of iGaming and fulfill the franchise’s mission:</p>
<p>“It was only a matter of time before Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Megapays created a real millionaire and it was a nice touch that it came bang on the anniversary of the game’s release. This game has got so many plaudits and won so many fans over the past 12 months, and we’re delighted that the life of one of those fans has been changed forever.” BTG CEO Nick Robinson</p>
<p>The player was having a regular session at the Betfair Casino, which secures a chunk of its games through the Powered by Relax platform when the jackpot fell. That marked the first time since September 2020 that Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Megapays had paid out a seven-figure jackpot.</p>

<p>The current amount won constitutes a 1,480,000% increase relative to the base bet and makes for one of the biggest success stories in jackpot slots. The win was possible through the Megapays mechanic which is exclusive to Relax Gaming and its partners.</p>
<p>Megapays has been touted as a solution that allows jackpot hunters to benefit from more frequent payouts. The Megapays mechanic introduces four different jackpot pools, name Mini, Midi, Major, and Mega.</p>
<p>These jackpots are not fixed but are subject to constantly increasing over time as with each bet, players are contributing to the total pool. As to the game itself, there are free spins as well as other spot-on game mechanics to bring you closer to the WWTBAM action.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CPO Simon Hammon welcomed this opportunity for the company to stay at the forefront of iGaming and provide meaningful solutions that benefit the player base and market.</p>
<p>“We hope the recent Who Wants to be a Millionaire Megapays winner enjoys this life-changing sum of money to the fullest and that others continue to appreciate the added excitement this jackpot brings,” Hammon concluded.</p>
