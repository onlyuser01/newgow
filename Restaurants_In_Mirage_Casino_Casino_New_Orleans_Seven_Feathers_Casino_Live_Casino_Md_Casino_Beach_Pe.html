<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>We have looked into this players' account and found the following:</p>
<p>On 3/09/2023, this player has made his initial withdrawal request.</p>
<p>Subsequently, our verification team has requested documents via email, as per our KYC policy, on the same day.</p>
<p>From the player was requested a valid ID, a valid proof of address and a bank statement.</p>
<p>On 05/09/2023, the player has sent us an email with documents.</p>
<p>On 06/09/2023, our verification team has checked said email and found the following:</p>
<p>The ID the player has sent only showed the front, without the back.</p>
<p>The Bank Statement had no details on it, therefore was irrelevant.</p>
<p>There was no proof of address attached.</p>
<p>On 06/09/2023, our verification team emailed again, requesting the missing documents.</p>
<p>On 07/09/2023, the player sent us the back of the ID.</p>
<p>On 07/09/2023, our verification team emailed again, requesting the proof of address and bank statement.</p>
<p>Following that, on 07/09/2023, the player made concerning statements on our Live Chat, claiming that he has no funds and his daughter is ill.</p>
<p>We have blocked his account in accordance to our Responsible Gambling Policy.</p>
<p>In addition, the chat agent advised of the missing documents.</p>
<p>Following that, the player has emailed our Support and requested a chat to inquire about his withdrawal, where each time he was advised of the missing documents.</p>
<p>On 12/09/2023, the player has sent in the missing documents and they were verified by our verification team on 14/09/2023.</p>
<p>We feel we have done everything we could on our side to inform the player of what we need in order to process his withdrawal request.</p>
<p>In addition, blocking his account was done in accordance to our Responsible Gambling Policy and in order to protect the player.</p>
