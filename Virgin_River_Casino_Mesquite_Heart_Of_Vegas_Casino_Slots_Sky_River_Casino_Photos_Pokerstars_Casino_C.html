<p>Looking to tap into bettors’ growing affinity for prop wagers, Rush Street Interactive introduced “Prop Central” in time for the start of the 2023 season.</p>

<p>Chicago-based Rush Street Interactive, which operates online and retail sportsbooks under the BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse brands, noted Prop Central presents bettors with a more expansive, functional avenue for pre-game and live proper wagers across multiple sports.</p>
<p>Prop Central reimagines the way player props are consumed within the sportsbook interface. Historically, popular props betting content was decentralized throughout the app and primarily found under the relevant sports event,” according to a statement issued by the operator. “Now customers have a central hub for all player props across the major sports, presented in an easy-to-use, uncluttered format.”</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive is currently available with mobile or retail businesses in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>RSI Tapping Into Prop Bet Popularity</p>
<p>Prop bets are conducive to a variety of sports, of which football is one, indicating the arrival of Rush Street’s Prop Central could prove well-timed.</p>
<p>These wagers are increasingly popular with bettors and sportsbook operators alike. Prop bets expand the wagering menu for bettors while offering clients avenues beyond traditional pre-game bets, such as sides and totals. Additionally, prop bets can be more team or player-focused than traditional sports wagers.</p>
<p>Operators like prop bets because the expanded menu, much of it including longer odds fare, is attractive to bettors and presents an avenue for boosting revenue. Props bets also lend themselves to being efficient in the burgeoning in-game or live betting market.</p>
<p>Currently, about half of all sports bets are placed live or in-game. That wagering style is popular in markets outside the US, namely Europe, where slower-paced sports are popular with bettors. In the US, sports such as basketball, hockey, and, to a lesser extent, football aren’t conducive to in-game betting. However, baseball and golf, among others, are suited for it.</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive Improves Squares Game</p>
<p>In addition to the debut of Prop Central, Rush Street Interactive also said it improved its popular Squares football game, which applies to both college and NFL contests.</p>
<p>“In addition to the existing prizes, including a $10,000 Bonus Money grand prize jackpot, customers can now earn Profit Boosts for a ‘near miss,’ added the operator. “If a customer correctly matches only one out of two numbers, RSI will reward the ‘near miss’ with a 25% Profit Boost, giving customers more chances to win at no additional cost.”</p>
<p>The operator also noted its sportsbooks will feature first touchdown insurance, odds boost and parlay insurance this year.</p>
