    <h1>Best Crypto Casinos Casinos In Bossier City Casino Cake Real Cash Casino Games Yaamava Resort Casino</h1>

<p>Afternoon Nick and thank you for your mail and response. During the sign up and registration I submitted a stamped and signed proof of bank account as well as a photo of my proof of ID. I also did the email verification as requested while I was doing their KYC or whatever they call. Hours later I received notification that my account had been approved and opened so naturally I logged in and attempted to claim the bonus and attempted to open the Candy game for which the bonus was meant for and that’s when it all fell apart. I made use of the online live chat as well as submitting pics as per below. The lady on the chat went through the normal process of asking me all the questions as well as asking if my account was approved, she then said she was escalating the issue and would revert back shortly. When she got back to me her advice was that I make use of a VPN. After that I resigned myself to the fact that after going through the sign up process the verification stage and the frustration of trying to redeem the bonus as well as numerous attempts to open the said game as well as others that it was not going to improve and the online chat as well as the support were not to concerned even with the submitted pic’s.</p>
