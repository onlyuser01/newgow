    <h1>Red Dragon Casino Hard Rock Casino Tampa Florida Casino In Tulsa Ok Borgata Online Casino New Jersey</h1>

<p>A casino winner from Mahtomedi, Minnesota has been assaulted and robbed of over $38,000 after returning home from Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino</p>
<p>According to charging documents, Deangelo Romaine Jacox (32), identified as the truck’s driver, and passengers Shawn Eric Lewis Jr. (35), and Tristin Tyler Jacox Mann (33) are the three men who assaulted and stole around $38,100 from the 67-year-old victim who was returning to his residence in the 700 block of Griffin Court at around 2:15 a.m. on Sunday.</p>
<p>A Lucky Night at the Casino Gone Wrong</p>
<p>Located just 40 minutes outside of the Twin Cities, Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino is an appealing spot for gamblers with its 1800 slots, 40 table games, bingo, and a dedicated poker room.</p>
<p>After spending a few hours there and scooping up an impressive win of thousands of dollars, the victim returned home only to be robbed and assaulted outside his home.</p>
<p>The nightmare started when he noticed a red pickup truck pulling up to his property and two men getting out of the motor vehicle and starting to physically assault him. Next, they took his casino earnings in cash from him and left in the same pickup truck.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint that was filed in Washington County District Court states that as the victim was subject to punching and kicking, two of his female relatives exited his house, at which point the robbers threatened they “were going to kill the girls”.</p>
<p>One of the assaulters pointed a gun at one of the two women, asking her to get back into the house or be shot.</p>
<p>The three men then fled the scene. The victim used his vehicle to follow them until the suspects were stopped by Oakdale police officers next to the intersection of Minnesota 36 and White Bear Avenue in Maplewood.</p>
<p>The Three Men Are Now Facing Charges</p>
<p>The three suspects are now each facing a series of charges, including aiding and abetting first- and second-degree aggravated robbery as well as aiding and abetting threats of violence – reckless disregard risk.</p>
<p>Jacox is also facing an additional charge of fleeing police, according to the same court documents.</p>
<p>It is not known whether the three men followed their victim to his home from the casino located in the Red Wing area.</p>
<p>Lewis Jr. and Jacox Mann showed up in Washington County District Court earlier in the week, on Tuesday morning. The court established Lewis’ bond to be set at $250,000 while Jacox Mann’s bond was set at $150,000, both without conditions.</p>
<p>Jacox failed to appear in court. Since his criminal complaint had not been signed by a judge before the hold expiring at 3:13 a.m., he was released from custody.</p>
<p>According to Washington County Sheriff’s Office’s spokeswoman, Laura Perkins, Jacox was arrested on a warrant on Tuesday night and he is expected to appear in court on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>In 2021, a 74-year-old Win-River Casino winner in Redding was robbed at gunpoint while returning home from the casino.</p>
<p>It is not only casino winners who are at risk of falling victim to robbers. At the end of November, a Sacramento Capital Casino attacker was convicted of robbery and murder after he attempted to rob the venue and fatally wounded a security guard in the process.</p>
