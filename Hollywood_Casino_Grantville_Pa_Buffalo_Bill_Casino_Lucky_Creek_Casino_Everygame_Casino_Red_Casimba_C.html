    <h1>Hollywood Casino Grantville Pa Buffalo Bill Casino Lucky Creek Casino Everygame Casino Red Casimba C</h1>

<p>iGaming Group partner casinos licensed under the Malta Gaming Authority will be among the first to get Invading Vegas, Play’n GO’s latest slot game</p>
<p>The game is made available through iGG’s White Label Solutions and will give partner operators an immediate content boost. The new sci-fi-themed slot is a one-of-a-kind game that sets the Las Vegas Strip as the place of an outworldly battle with extra-terrestrials invading Sin City to bring around destruction, but also a chance for you to get a solid payday.</p>
<p>Players stand to win through a number of excellent features, to wit Lock on Re-Spins, Walking Wilds, and Free Spins. All of these features are designed to elevate the overall experience and bring you the best possible satisfaction. Stacked Wilds and Walking Wilds will all be part of the gameplay and the different stages of spinning.</p>
<p>Invading Las Vegas and Taking Elvis Presly for a Probe</p>
<p>The game, tempting as it is, will be only available for iGG White Label Solutions casinos over the next three weeks with Play’n GO then scaling the overall product offer beyond that.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, iGG White Labels COO &amp; head of sales Phil Pearson said that partnering with Play’n Go was in itself a huge success. He added:</p>
<p>Like any good relationship, coming back for seconds is always a good sign. But unlike my teenage years, we are going to put even more effort in and make it the best exclusive release we’ve have ever had. iGG White Labels COO &amp; head of sales Phil Pearson</p>
<p>Pearson was also happy with the very concept of the slot. As he put it, a game where aliens can end up abducting Elvis and probing him, for a lack of a better word, was something that tickled player fancy. Pearson also called this a great opportunity for the two companies to carry on with their partnership well into 2023.</p>
<p>iGG recently launched two more casinos, to name Simsino and WunderWins. Overall, the company has been looking to expand its presence in iGaming by providing the technology necessary to run outstanding brands but also looking to bring around a variety of excellent content options for newly-launched and existing operations.</p>
