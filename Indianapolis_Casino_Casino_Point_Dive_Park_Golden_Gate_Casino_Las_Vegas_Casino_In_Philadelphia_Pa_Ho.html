    <h1>Indianapolis Casino Casino Point Dive Park Golden Gate Casino Las Vegas Casino In Philadelphia Pa Ho</h1>

<p>Casinos and racinos in Ohio produced another record in terms of revenue in October since their re-opening from the coronavirus shutdowns. The Ohio Casino Control Commission released its revenue report Monday, posting $169.1 million in gambling revenue generated for the month by the 11 land-based gambling establishments in the state.</p>
<p>The gross gaming revenue (GGR) generated by the gambling facilities in Ohio was up 6.7% compared to the $158.4 million generated in October 2019, an astounding result for an industry subjected to shutdowns from mid-March through mid-June, and currently operating under capacity restrictions.</p>
<p>On a Steady Upward Trend</p>
<p>Since their re-opening after nearly 3 months of being closed, casinos and racinos in Ohio posted higher revenues for each subsequent month of operations, with the October figure being a record in the history of the gambling in the state.</p>
<p>Ohio casinos accounted for $74.8 million of the total GGR, an increase of 9.84% compared to October 2019, while racinos won $94.3 million, up 4.4% year-on-year. Around one-third of the total GGR is forwarded to the state in the form of taxes and fees.</p>
<p>The state’s 4 casinos, unlike the 7 racinos which are not allowed to offer anything else besides video lottery terminals similar to slot machines, are permitted to offer players table games and poker rooms. Hollywood Casino Columbus, operated by Penn National Gaming, was the top earner casino, reporting $20.3 million in revenues. The casino was the focus of a deal between Penn and Kindred Group in September, which provided access for Kindred’s brand, Unibet, to pursue licensing in Ohio.</p>
<p>Top Racino Matched Top Casino</p>
<p>Despite being allowed to offer only video lottery terminals, MGM Northfield Park, which topped the list of racino earners for the month, also generated $20.3 million.</p>
<p>Cleveland market gambling revenue in October increased to $52.9 million, up 5.8% from the same period the prior year. The biggest jump in GGR posted Jack Thisledown Racinos, which was up 16.4% year-over-year, to $13.8 million, followed by Jack Cleveland Casino which generated $18.7 million, an increase of 11.9% compared to October 2019, while MGM Northfield Park racino generated 5% less year-over-year.</p>
