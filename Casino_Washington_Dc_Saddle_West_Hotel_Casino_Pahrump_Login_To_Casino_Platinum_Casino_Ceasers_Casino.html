<p>Playtech and the Responsible Gambling Council entered into a key collaboration. Under the partnership, the two entities will aim at safer gambling, mental health, and digital well-being.</p>
<p>New Collaboration between the RGC and Playtech</p>
<p>The world’s leading gambling technology company Playtech revealed today that it initiated a new collaboration with the international leader in problem gambling prevention, the Responsible Gambling Council (RGC). Under the new collaboration, Playtech and RGC will aim at strengthening the “industry insights to inform and advance safer gambling, mental health, and digital well-being”. According to Playtech’s statement, this collaboration represents one of the first examinations of safer gambling together with digital well-being.</p>
<p>The new relationship is a part of Playtech’s responsible business strategy known as “Sustainable Success”. Together with RGC, Playtech aims to help people having healthier online lives but also looks to improve the way the company supports digital and mental well-being and safer gambling. Furthermore, Playtech will support the RGC with its expertise and experience in order for the council to examine the links between mental health, digital well-being, and gambling. To achieve this, Playtech plans to combine research, leadership, and evaluation initiatives.</p>
<p>The RGC has experience over 35 years in problem gambling and prevention in Canada and internationally. The council will greatly contribute towards the search and evaluation. The extensive experience of the RGC with regulators, operators, and treatment providers will undoubtedly contribute towards the ultimate goal of the collaboration with Playtech.</p>
<p>A Meaningful Partnership</p>
<p>In a statement, Playtech’s Interim Chairman, Claire Milne shared her excitement about the collaboration with the RGC. She said: “The Responsible Gambling Council is a leader in research and best practice standards that drive the gambling sector to build a more sustainable and safe industry for the benefit of all stakeholders.“</p>
<p>According to her, the company’s “Sustainable Success” strategy, which ultimately is looking to develop safer gambling, is achievable with the help of “meaningful partnerships”. In conclusion, Milne said that the new collaboration with RGC will undoubtedly help Playtech achieve its goal for a safe environment that supports the digital and mental well-being.</p>
<p>The Director of RGC’s Center for the Advancement of Best Practices, Janine Robinson also commented on the subject by saying: “Playtech is an industry leader and we look forward to working together to influence positive change and advance responsible gambling standards.” According to her, the impact of the digital world on mental health is a topic that is raising a growing concern and it is yet to be understood. “We believe adopting digital resilience and safer gambling behaviors will be an important part of protecting mental health,” concluded Robinson.</p>
