<p>Internet streamer-turned-fighter Logan Paul will be facing off undefeated 50-0 boxing legend Floyd Mayweather in an exhibition fight on February 20, 2021.</p>
<p>Mayweather to Take on Logan Paul in Exhibition Fight in 2021</p>
<p>Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather versus Logan Paul is on. The boxer has chosen to return in quite the fashion, agreeing to an exhibition fight against Paul, a YouTube influencer and streamer who has amassed quite the popularity fighting various personalities, including NBA star Nate Robinson whom he took out in Round 2 most recently a week ago.</p>
<p>The fight is scheduled for February 20, 2021 and it will be the first time Mayweather has returned to the ring after defeating Japanese MMA fighter Tenshin Nasukawa in 2018. Paul is taking on a fighter who could as well define his career as a serious fighter, something that most people have been calling him out on, as they see him as an Internet sensation.</p>
<p>Yet, Logan is slowly beginning to build up a name for himself, and taking on Mayweather could be interesting. Mayweather, though, is considered the best pound-for-pound boxer in his generation, and the history of the sport. He has gone 50-0 and has fought and defeated such division gatekeepers as Manny Pacquiao and Canelo Alvarez, including Conor McGregor.</p>
<p>Spicing Things up Online</p>
<p>In true Logan Paul fashion, the fighter is already taking to Twitter to badmouth his opponent and whip up anticipation. While fans are not too sure of Paul’s actual chances of success, the exhibition fight is expected to excite record interest. Presently, Logan Paul is posted at (+900) against Floyd Mayweather’s (-3500), clearly giving the legend an iron-clad chance of success.</p>
<p>Mayweather is not very likely to go hard on Paul in the fight, given his expertise and experience, but there is no telling how far Paul could push him in the coming months. Mayweather is no stranger to Internet feuds, though.</p>
<p>He spent a fair share of his time responding to McGregor in the period leading to the pair’s fight in 2017 in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Paul is already starting his rhetoric machine, targeting Mayweather online, but he must factor in the simple fact that he will be at the mercy of his opponent.</p>
<p>Many community buffs seem to think that Mayweather can take Paul in a single round, but the event is likely to stretch on a little longer, as anticipation and interest will be big. Paul must approach the fight fully aware that Mayweather is a fighter who was never knocked down, or defeated under any circumstances.</p>
<p>He better hit the gym and dial down the Twitter vitriol.</p>
