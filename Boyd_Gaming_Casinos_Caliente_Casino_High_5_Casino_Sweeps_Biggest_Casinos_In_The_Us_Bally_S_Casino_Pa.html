Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why? Have you mentioned gambling problem?</p>
<p>I have checked Responsible Gambling section on the website, and this is what I found https://vespercasino.com/about-us#responsible_gambling:</p>
