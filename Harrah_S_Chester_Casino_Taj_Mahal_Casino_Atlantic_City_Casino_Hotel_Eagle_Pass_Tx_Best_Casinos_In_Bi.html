<p>The supplier will help the turnkey platform to offer a greater diversity of content and products to its network of operators</p>
<p>As a result, Quantum Gaming will feature numerous games by Endorphina and make it so that iGaming businesses enrich their library with leading titles from across numerous categories.</p>
<p>Quantum Gaming Gets Endorphina Content Boost</p>
<p>Endorphina has a strong focus on slot games, with the company having crafted a number of excellent player favorites over the past months, including Joker Ra, Lucky Cloverland Dice, Fruletta Dice, Riches of Caliph, Blue Slot, Rabbits, Rabbits, Rabbits!, and many more.</p>
<p>The white-label platform will have the opportunity to offer all of these titles to its partners moving forward. Commenting on the tie-up Quantum Gaming CEO Oliver de Bono had this to add, praising Endorphina’s exceptional content:</p>
<p>I’m delighted about striking a partnership with Endorphina. Their software is tried and true, and it will bring a new dimension to the Quantum Gaming offering and help us offer an even more diverse portfolio. Quantum Gaming CEO Oliver de Bono</p>
<p>Endorphina sales manager Khadija El Abi was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that the supplier was very happy to work with Quantum Gaming Platform indeed. This would provide the company with the opportunity to deliver its games to new customers and boost the studio’s global expansion ambitions.</p>
<p>“Global expansion is a high priority for Endorphina, and we’re sure our portfolio of games will be a success and loved by the players! We are looking forward to a successful collaboration,” Abi concluded. Endorphina has been making strides of its own as well.</p>
<p>The company recently had its games introduced to Livespins, a platform that makes it easier for brand ambassadors and streamers to connect with players. Endorphina has also strengthened its presence in various jurisdictions across Europe with the company expanding with Staryes in Italy and Casino777 in the Netherlands.</p>
