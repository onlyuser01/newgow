<p>Meanwhile, chair Grant, who just replaced Roger Lewis in the position, used the opportunity to thank the outgoing chair for his service</p>
<p>Racecourse Media Group (RMG), an organization encompassing a number of British racecourses, has appointed the experienced Scott Smith as a non-executive director. According to the company, the new hire will step into the office on October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Smith currently serves as the chief financial officer of the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB). He boasts an impressive track record in the finance sector, having served in finance-related positions at various sports, property, construction and consultancy companies.</p>
<p>Before being named as CFO of the ECB, Smith served as the CFO of the America’s Cup. Earlier still, RMG’s new appointee worked as a finance director of the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport.</p>
<p>In addition to his experience with finance, Smith is an avid hiker, having climbed some of the world’s most notorious mountains. In addition to that, he has further tested his endurance in the 4 Deserts series.</p>
<p>Having proven his financial expertise and personal resilience, Smith will be a valuable addition to RMG’s team.</p>
<p>Smith Is Honored to Join RMG’s Board</p>
<p>Smith commented on his new appointment, expressing his desire to help RMG innovate and develop growth opportunities.</p>
<p>In such a dynamic and fast-moving industry, I look forward to helping drive innovation and developing growth opportunities for the sport of horse racing. Scott Smith, NED, RMG</p>
<p>RMG’s char, Conor Grant, welcomed the new hire on board, praising his extensive experience in multiple sectors, especially sports. He said that the appointment will help shape RMG’s business and maximize the company’s exposure and returns to its shareholders. This, in turn, will benefit racing as a whole.</p>
<p>Lewis Departs from RMG</p>
<p>Grant, who just replaced Roger Lewis as chairman, used the opportunity to thank the outgoing chair for his service.</p>
<p>Roger has been on the Board for well over a decade, first as a Board member and then Chairman, and has been instrumental in the development and success of RMG and its businesses over the last decade or so. We wish him all the very best for the future. Conor Grant, chair, RMG</p>
<p>Lewis also released a statement on the matter, saying that he feels privileged to have had the opportunity to serve RMG’s board for over a decade. He wished the team all the best, hoping that the company would continue to deliver great results.</p>
<p>Lewis concluded: “Under Conor’s chairmanship I am confident that RMG will continue to deliver the best possible results for our racecourses for years to come.”</p>
