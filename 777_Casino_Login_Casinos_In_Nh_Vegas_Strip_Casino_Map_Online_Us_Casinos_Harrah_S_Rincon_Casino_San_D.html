    <h1>777 Casino Login Casinos In Nh Vegas Strip Casino Map Online Us Casinos Harrah S Rincon Casino San D</h1>

<p>Hello I’ve handed this over to the gambling commission aswell but just thought your team could help</p>
<p>i was able to access my friends 32 red account and gamble 7k within 2 weeks without being asked about proof of funds ? And why I was always playing for long periods during the night or why I kept swapping deposits between 2 different debits cards ? I was never messaged regarding failed withdrawals either</p>
<p>my friends account has a total of £7500 deposits from the day it was opened until closed ? So from march to end of July he himself only deposited £500 but within 2 weeks 7k was deposited with 2 different bank cards belonging to myself and 32 red didn’t bat an eyelid even tho the better patterns and spending patterns had massively changed</p>
<p>my friend has emailed them back and fourth and they take zero fault and feel they done enough regarding this issue</p>
<p>they have now told me they will not speak on the matter again and basically they have turned there back on it</p>
<p>I just want people to know what this company are like as there is no safer gambling on this website as I showed ever sign of a problem gambler from betting for long periods at night ? Depositing big money over short periods .. countless failed withdrawals</p>
<p>they claimed they tried to phone my friend but he didn’t answer so rather than blocking the account after the safe gambling phone call was missed they just allowed more deposits at crazy times</p>
<p>this needs to be known to the world</p>
<p>I done wrong but I have serious gambling issues and I’m trying to sort it via gamstop and gamblers anonymous but when a customer struggles this is we’re big companies should be catching these crazy spending sprees and strange betting behaviour and gambling patterns</p>
