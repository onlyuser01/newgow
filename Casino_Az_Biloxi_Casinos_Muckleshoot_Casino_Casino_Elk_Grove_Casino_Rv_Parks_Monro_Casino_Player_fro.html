    <h1>Casino Az Biloxi Casinos Muckleshoot Casino Casino Elk Grove Casino Rv Parks Monro Casino Player fro</h1>

<p>Good day.</p>
<p>I registered with this casino on Sun, Oct 22, 23:27.</p>
<p>I went through the registration process from my home country, Belarus, without using any VPN services. The login was also performed from Belarus. All the required information was filled in my profile, the selected country was Belarus, and a Belarusian phone number was provided. There were no blocks or warnings about registration being impossible. I made a deposit using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Today when I tried to access my account, I couldn't. The casino's system indicates that authorization from my country territory is not possible. When I contacted Customer Service about this situation, they referred to a rule stipulating the cancellation of deposits made by players from Belarus. However, at the time of my registration, I did not violate this rule p. 4.4 " and will provide false information", I provided my truthful data. As of today, it's impossible to register on the site from my country because the casinoâ€™s system shows authorization from my territory is impossible. However, at the time of my registration, this was not the case.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the casino accepted a player it shouldn't have and took his deposit. I request a refund of the deposit to the wallet it came from. I am attaching the screenshots below.</p>
<p>It turns out that the casino breached their own rules by accepting players and their deposits from restricted countries and subsequently blocking their accounts under the same rules while keeping the deposits for themselves. This is outright fraud.</p>
