<p>888sport, the sports betting arm of global online gaming group 888 Holdings, announced an extension of its deal with the NFL would allow the brand to continue as the league’s official sports betting partner in Ireland and the UK until 2025.</p>
<p>Building on the Successful Partnership</p>
<p>The new sponsorship arrangement between the NFL and the highly popular sports betting brand in this part of Europe is looking to build on the successful partnership over the last two seasons, following their initial deal in September 2020.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Kieran Spellman, vice president and Head of Sport at 888sport, outlined the delight to continue to be the official sports betting partner of the professional football league and be part of its “continuing growth and success” in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>“Our partnership will bring 888sport closer to the heart of live sport and continue to inspire us to create great content-rich and entertaining experiences for our customers. We are really looking forward to continuing our work with the NFL and cannot wait for the start of the new season.” Kieran Spellman, VP and Head of Sport, 888sport</p>
<p>Under the extended agreement, fans of the NFL visiting the 2022 NFL London Games at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium will be able to see the 888sport logo on the exterior of the stadia and throughout the fan zones, and on the LED advertising boards during the games.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to be continuing and expanding our partnership with 888sport. We look forward to working with them on innovative ways to create touchpoints that will resonate with our fans and help us to reach a broadening audience.” Michelle Webb, UK Senior Director, Commercial, NFL</p>
<p>The series of international matches was approved by the NFL as part of its decision to expand the regular season to 17 games to allow for up to four of the teams from the conference whose teams were eligible for a ninth regular-season home game to instead play a neutral-site international game.</p>
<p>‘Another Great Step Forward’</p>
<p>Also commenting on the sponsorship, director of International Marketing and Head of Sponsorships at 888sports Pedro Barreda hailed the partnership as the brand’s “another great step forward,” helping it to strengthen its presence at two of its core markets while also looking to establish a long-lasting partnership with the league.</p>
<p>The extended sponsorship will make 888sport the NFL’s exclusive presenter brand across the league’s apps and Fantasy products such as Pick’em, the Super Bowl Challenge, and Draft Predictor, on top of the strong presence in TV matches and highlight shows.</p>
<p>Across digital, 888sport will film unique and engaging video content in collaboration with the NFL and will offer some exclusive prizes like official merchandise and Super Bowl event tickets to sports fans.</p>
