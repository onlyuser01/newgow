<p>BetCity, a Dutch sports betting operator, has expanded its footprint in sports. The company has inked a partnership deal with the International Hockey Federation (FIH).</p>
<p>BetCity to Support Pro Hockey</p>
<p>The agreement will see BetCity as the FIH’s official betting partner for the next three years. Notably, this is the first time the hockey federation has worked together with a gambling operator.</p>
<p>As per the deal, BetCity will sponsor some of the biggest professional hockey events. Until 2025, the sports betting company will support annual events such as the FIH Hockey Pro League in the Netherlands and the FIH Hockey Women’s World Cup.</p>
<p>The FIH will promote BetCity’s branding across the playfield during pro games. The operator’s logo will be visible the FIH Hockey Pro League matches in Nijmegen at the end of May.</p>
<p>The partnership between the two parties was made possible by Sportradar – the FIH’s official betting and gaming data right partner.</p>
<p>FIH Believes in BetCity’s Trustworthiness</p>
<p>Melvin Bostelaar, the chief executive officer of BetCity, commented on the partnership with the FIH. He noted that the Netherlands currently fields one of the best teams in the world, which is why he feels proud to work with the FIH.</p>
<p>As a 100% Dutch company, we are proud to be affiliated with the FIH and therefore being visible at matches in the Pro League and the Women’s Hockey World Cup of our national team! Melvin Bostelaar, CEO, BetCity</p>
<p>The FIH is also excited to work alongside BetCity. A statement by the Federation lauds BetCity as an “established, experienced and 100% Dutch supplier” that will improve engagement with the fans thanks to its supreme products. The Federation believes that BetCity’s players are just as passionate about hockey and sports as they are for casino games.</p>
<p>Thierry Weil, the chief executive officer of the International Hockey Federation, also shared his point of view. He revealed that the FIH has sought a gambling partner for a while and wanted to find a reliable company. BetCity is exactly that, Weil added.</p>
<p>Thanks to our collaboration with Sportradar, we’ve found in BetCity.nl the ideal partner to open the doors of the betting market to hockey. This first-of-a-kind move for us will hopefully generate further similar opportunities in this area in the future. Thierry Weil, CEO, FIH</p>
<p>Speaking about being reliable and trustworthy, BetCity recently joined the International Betting Integrity Association and reiterated its commitment to safe, legal and responsible gambling. In December 2021, the company strengthened its responsible gaming team with the addition of two experienced employees.</p>
