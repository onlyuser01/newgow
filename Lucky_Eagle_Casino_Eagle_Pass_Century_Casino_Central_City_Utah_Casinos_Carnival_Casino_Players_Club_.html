<p>Genius Named David Levy as Its New Chairman</p>
<p>Leading sports data technology company, Genius Sports Group, announced on Tuesday that it hired the services of David Levy. In his new position as chairman, he is going to lead the company’s board for operations and strategy.</p>
<p>As a veteran in the global sports betting industry, Levy has held a range of leadership positions. Before joining Genius, he was president at Turner Broadcasting Inc. Furthermore, he has also held the roles of senior advisor at Raine Group, and Arctos Sports Group.</p>

Furthermore, he stressed that Genius is positioned at the center of this unique ecosystem, and it is consistently leading the industry’s development. In conclusion, Levy said that he is thrilled to join the company at such a historic time.</p>
<p>Levy Brings Significant Experience of More Than 30 Years in the Industry</p>
<p>Levy was employed at Turner for three decades. During that time, he played significant roles in expanding the company’s media rights and helped secure agreements with MLB, NBA, PGA, and NCAA. Furthermore, Levy has also helped Turner increase original premium content. With his help, Turner has inked multiple agreements, which represented a significant change beyond traditional TV rights.</p>
<p>One of the deals which were led by Levy was the 2010 deal with the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball. Back then, he helped Turner partner with CBS for multi-media rights, as well as exclusive TV rights for 2014 Final Four, and the 2016 National Championship Game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Levy also played a key role in 2017, when Turner expanded its portfolio and acquired rights to UEFA. As a part of that deal, Turner also acquired rights for the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, and Europa League.</p>
