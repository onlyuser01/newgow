<p>Rocket Reels review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Rocket Reels is a slot designed to take the player to other worlds. This space-themed game uses rocket-themed bonuses, planetary symbols, and an alien backdrop to put the player in the jumpseat of an interplanetary ride.</p>
<p>As well as strange planets, the reels are covered in asteroids, moons, and other celestial bodies. The player will have to navigate their way through them if they want to make it to the rewards promised by the stars.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The theme of interplanetary adventure is given a fifties-pulp twist by the bright primary color scheme and rounded design of the spaceships. These graphics evoke a time when space travel was still in the near future and offered limitless potential.</p>
<p>The tone of the slot is backed up by a soundtrack that is rich in alien sounds. Both the music and the sound effects contribute to transporting the player to another world (or, indeed, other worlds!).</p>
<p>All of this is supported by simple but varied animations that serve to make the game visually stimulating and easy to understand.</p>
<p>The multiplier win in the Rocket Reels slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Rocket Reels eschews the traditional reel and row setup in favor of a seven-by-seven grid. Instead of using winlines, players win by forming batches of five or more matching symbols connected vertically or horizontally.</p>
<p>When the player lands a winning combo, the cascade feature is triggered. The winning combination is destroyed and a new set of symbols fall from the top of the grid to replace the destroyed symbols.</p>
<p>If a new winning combination is formed, the cascade is retriggered until no more winning combos land.</p>
<p>All this is pretty standard stuff for a Hacksaw Gaming grid-slot. What gives it a bit of its own flavor are the Multiplier Rockets, which are described in full below.</p>
<p>The special twist of the game - the Multiplier Rockets</p>
<p>All in all, it makes for solid and entertaining gameplay.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Wild symbols can substitute for any other symbol with the exception of the Free Spin symbol and the Multiplier Rocket symbols.</p>
<p>A randomly triggered UFO event can occur on any spin when Multiplier Rockets are active. When triggered, the UFO event beams up to 20 symbols off the reels allowing new symbols to cascade in and giving the player a chance at new winning combos.</p>
<p>UFO can randomly visit on a spin with Multiplier Rockets</p>
<p>Multiplier Rocket symbols are Rocket Reels’s special twist. When three or more Multiplier Rockets land on one spin, all Rockets are shot up their columns, destroying every symbol in their way and leaving behind a multiplier on every square.</p>
<p>A cascade then occurs to replace the destroyed symbol. Any winning combinations that use a multiplier square have that multiplier applied to the win. If multiplier multipliers are used, they are added together (i.e. two x3 multipliers make a x6 multiplier, rather than a x9 multiplier). Multipliers can be between x1 and x75.</p>
<p>If three or more Free Spin symbols fall on one spin, the player receives eight free spins. During the Free Spin bonus, every rocket launches regardless of how many land on a given spin.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Rocket Reels is 96.20%, a little higher than our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Rocket Reels slot machine</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The high volatility of Rocket Reels is in keeping with many of Hacksaw Gaming’s slots. We like high volatility slots in general as they work well with our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The combination of average RTP and high volatility is acceptable (though of course we always like a higher RTP where possible).</p>
<p>The gameplay is solid and varied. The bonus is fairly standard, but the Rocket symbol gimmick works well to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>However, Rocket Reels' main attraction is its visual design and accompanying audio. The front end of this slot is a delight for any space nerd or fan of sci-fi movies.</p>
