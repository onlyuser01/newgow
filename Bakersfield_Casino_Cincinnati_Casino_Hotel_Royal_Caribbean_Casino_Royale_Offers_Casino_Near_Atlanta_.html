<p>The leading provider of software products for the global iGaming industry, Bede Gaming, announced a senior-level appointment. The company confirmed Tuesday it has appointed Kirsty Stewart to the role of Chief Legal and Client Services Officer.</p>
<p>In her new role, Stewart will oversee strategic legal processes. This is in fact not the first position for the legal expert with the company considering that she first joined Bede Gaming back in March 2018. Before that, Stewart has accumulated more than 20 years of experience within the Oil and Gas industry.</p>
<p>As a part of Bede Gaming, she held the role of General Counsel. During her tenure in that position, she oversaw different projects, agreements and negotiations with new and existing clients. Additionally, Stewart has held the role of Data Protection Officer. At the time, she collaborated with the company's Risk and Compliance Department and helped address privacy and governance issues.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the company's Secretary of the Boards, Stewart played a strategic role in helping shape Bede's "leadership governance structures." Now, her appointment to the new role combined with the fact that she is a lawyer "demonstrates Bede's maturity and commitment to governance at this level," a statement released by the company reveals.</p>
<p>Bede's Chief Executive Officer, Colin Cole-Johnson, commented on the topic saying: "Kirsty is an expert on Bede's existing commercial relationships, playing a pivotal role in ongoing customer contracts as well as new business activity." Finally, he pointed out: "It makes perfect sense for her skillset to sit within our Executive Team, helping shape our ongoing commercial and customer strategies."</p>
<p>It was back in March 2020 when Bede became a part of the Gauselmann Group. After that, in March 2022, Colin Cole-Johnson was named CEO. Now, the leading software supplier supports the works of five operators that are globally recognized. Bede's team consists of approximately 300 members from 3 continents.</p>
<p>Stewart was also excited about her new role with Bede. "Bringing the client services and legal teams together under one leadership within the c-suite shows the importance Bede has placed in delivering for our customers, as well as the prominence that commercial growth and excellent customer relations hold in the business strategy," she said.</p>
<p>According to Stewart, her appointment will ultimately bring benefits to Bede's customers. She pointed out that a key goal for the company is to be recognized for its expertise and knowledge by the clients. "We want our clients to have complete confidence in us to help them deliver their strategic goals," explained Stewart in conclusion.</p>
