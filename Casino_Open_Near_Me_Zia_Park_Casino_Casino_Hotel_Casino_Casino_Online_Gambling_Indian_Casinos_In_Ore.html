    <h1>Casino Open Near Me Zia Park Casino Casino Hotel Casino Casino Online Gambling Indian Casinos In Ore</h1>

<p>Ok, I'm ready to pass a verdict on Casinonic.</p>
<p>My conclusion is: If you know what is good for you, play somewhere else!</p>
<p>The problem arose when it came to the verification of my payment method. I use Revolut and deposit with their virtual Mastercard. Since this is a virtual card, obviously there is no physical copy, it is only available in the app. I took a photo of it and sendt it in along with my Revolut account statement from May which clearly indicates both my personal details as well as transaction info showing the card used for the deposit to Casinonic.</p>
<p>They declined it. They insisted I needed to produce a photo of the physical card. Then, I spoke with them explaining how it works. They refused it again, once more insisting to see the physical copy... Remember, no physical copy of this exists.</p>
<p>What I had sendt in was more than enough documentation, and these exact same documents have in fact gotten me fully verified with the likes of bitStarz, King Billy, betheat, Rocketplay, you name it..!</p>
<p>Speaking to support wasn't a very pleasant experience either. They weren't directly rude but there was certainly an abscense of politeness. Also, they disabled the chat for me. All I did was rate it with a thumbs down, because it asked for a rating. I was not offensive at all.</p>
<p>So, better to just move on from these guys as well. There are so many good casinos out there, I'm not wasting any more energy on someone like this.</p>
