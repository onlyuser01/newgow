    <h1>Chumba Casino Log In Louisville Casino Ac Casinos Palm Desert Casino Renaissance Jaragua Hotel Casin</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>the casino has been blocking payouts for almost 4 weeks. They are saying they are "updating" their "payment system" which is obviously a lie as they said the same thing to another customer who submitted a complaint on this platform and who has not been paid according to the thread. In the meantime they went over to kick me out of the live chat and block my IP for entering the live chat whenever I ask a question about payouts.</p>
<p>Also, there is an error message in the withdrawal section which is permanently displayed and says: "You CANNOT PROCESS WHILE you have a PENDING WITHDRAWAL REQUEST." The truth is, I don't have a pending withdrawal request. My last withdrawal request from Jan 6 had been successfully processed and I received the money a few minutes later (1,500 EUR via Ecopayz). Yet, this withdrawal has still the status "Accept &amp; Wait" in the transaction history.</p>
<p>A few days ago I tried to withdraw my funds by using another payment method called Jeton. Both withdrawal requests via Jeton have been rejected, and now the above-mentioned error message is displayed for Jeton as well.</p>
<p>Some additional details:</p>
<p>My account is successfully verified.</p>
<p>I already received two withdrawals (2,000 EUR &amp; 1.500 EUR). Both withdrawals have been processed within minutes.</p>
<p>The payment method I used for deposits so far: Ecopayz &amp; Jeton</p>
<p>The payment method I used for withdrawals so far: Ecopayz</p>
<p>I hope you can help me to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Bastian</p>
