<p>Rivers Casino Portsmouth Is Virginiaâ€™s Permanent First Casino</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Portsmouth opened on January 23 this year and is the first permanent casino in Virginia. Back then, the property held a grand opening ceremony to commemorate its opening, welcoming many public guests, as well as the Mayor of Portsmouth, Shannon Glover, the director of Portsmouth Economic Development, Brian Donahue, and the executive director of the Virginia Lottery, Kelly T. Gee.</p>
<p>The property offers over 1,400 slot machines and dozens of gaming, making it an attractive destination for gambling aficionados. In addition, sports fans can place wagers at the BetRivers Sportsbook at the venue.</p>
<p>However, not everything has been frictionless for the casino. In May, just a few months after opening, the property was slammed with its first fine. The penalty came as a result of licensing issues.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Portsmouth did not disclose the exact nature of its violation. However, it is known that the Virginia Lottery Board fined the venue $275,000 for the breach. As reported by the Lottery, Rivers Casino Portsmouth was cooperative and ready to implement remediation measures. After taking care of the issue, the Lottery confirmed that the casino is once again fully compliant.</p>
