<p>Evolution Gaming continues to expand with a new deal that will see its products introduced across Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment’s Parx casino iGaming sites in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming Products Rolling Out in Parx Casino</p>
<p>World leader of live dealer games Evolution Gaming will be entering Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment’s Parx Casino websites across New Jersey and Pennsylvania, bringing the states up to speed insofar as the live segment goes.</p>
<p>As a result, players will be able to experience a variety of classic titles, such as blackjack, roulette, and casino poker without actually having to leave their homes. All live games will be broadcast from a studio in New Jersey, followed by another one in Pennsylvania soon after.</p>
<p>The games will be available to both desktop and mobile users, as the company has made sure that compatibility wouldn’t be an issue. Players may choose from smartphones, tablets and desktop computers to play from.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest round of developments, Parx Casino SVP for iGaming and Sports, Matthew Cullen, has commended the efforts of the brand put into bringing cutting-edge products to gamers across the United States.</p>
<p>“Parx was the first Pennsylvania casino to offer RNG Blackjack games online,” Mr. Cullen reminded in an official statement. The addition of Evolution Gaming products, he explained, was a “natural step” forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it should be noted that pooling player bases from different states across the iGaming segment could lead to clashes with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and specifically the latest Opinion on the Wire Act of 1991.</p>
<p>A Continuous Growth in North America</p>
<p>Parx will roll out Infinite Blackjack as one of the premium titles available across its iGaming websites. Evolution Gaming has primarily focused on the European market so far, but the company is now looking into the United States, as laxer regulation has made it possible to launch online casinos. The studio already has an existing partnership with Penn National.</p>
<p>While Parx Casino is a Pennsylvania based property, the online footprint of the casino will span both New Jersey and New Jersey. Evolution Gaming’s Chief Commercial Officer, Sebastian Johannisson, shared his confidence and excitement to work with Parx Casino and expand the company’s footprint in North America.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming received an official go-ahead to seek expansion in Pennsylvania in September, 2019, after the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) issued an official license for the company.</p>
<p>In light of Evolution Gaming’s success in the U.S., the company also decided to double the size of its existing studio in New Jersey in November, 2019. The company received a formal approval by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) in mid-November to proceed with expansion of its facilities.</p>
<p>The studio is looking at a total square footage of 5,386, which will allow the company to add 24 new blackjack tables. Furthermore, Evolution will be adding a single Money Wheel table along with a Side Bet City table.</p>
