    <h1>Twin Arrows Casino Casino Eagle Pass Rolling Hills Casino Corning Ca Hollywood Casino Grantville Lig</h1>

<p>Good Evening. I had a problem with this particular casino from the beginning, I have only written 2 complaints. From the deposit but also some problems that happened during the game. The first complaint is here on the site, delete the other one because it was about betting. From the deposit, as I write in detail in the first complaint where I made it through neteller, they did not put it on the site for me immediately but they told me that they cannot and the money will be returned to my neteller account and after frequent pressures they did not return it but put it on my site themselves writes to my account manual method. my deposit via neteller is still pending. the withdrawal should have been made in the same way. I would have applied via live chat or email and they would have taken them from my account at site and they would put them in my bank account. I sent them statements from 2 banks. I made the application on April 15th, they took the money from the site, the balance was zero and they sent me an email on April 17th that they made the withdrawal and it takes 3-5 working days days to get into my bank account. I asked them for proof of the withdrawal because it was done off-site but they never sent it to me and they told me that the proof is the emails they send. On April 25, in the communications we had via email, they told me that the withdrawal was completed by them and I should check if they have the money entered my account. until May 2, which I expected, they had not entered (it was a weekend). On May 2, they told me that they would try again at the other bank that I wrote to them. but this time we will also send a confirmation of the withdrawal. today they said they did it on Wednesday, it takes another 3-5 working days for the money to come in, but they still didn't send a receipt. because I have almost daily communication via email, I tell them to send it to me and we will send everything soon. And here it will be the same as the first withdrawal and then they will suggest me another way (we have talked about alternatives like master/visa ecopayz astropay) they will buy time until I get bored and give up. don't forget to say that in order to make the first withdrawal they asked me via email to delete the negative a review I made here against eightstorm.com got 2 likes in the short time before I deleted it they checked it because I had a warning from the 2nd complaint I made here. I have all their emails. please do something because I'm so tired of the bullshit their.</p>
