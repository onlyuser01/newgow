<p>Gaming Innovation Group’s CCO said that the company is ”excited about the possibilities these new states provide”</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) has announced that it has successfully secured licenses in the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. According to the company, it was handed an Online Sports Wagering Operator License in the former state and a full Interactive Gaming Manufacturer License in the latter.</p>
<p>GiG explained that the first of the two licenses, issued by the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency, will see the company launch its Crab Sports brand in May. The group explained that Crab Sports will leverage its parent company’s extensive experience in launching new brands in complex regulated markets to establish itself as a player-favorite sportsbook in the Old Line State.</p>
<p>Maryland’s online gambling market is still young, having been launched less than a year ago. The early entry poises Crab Sports for success, making GiG’s new license an important development.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pennsylvania’s Gaming Control Board provided GiG with a full license that will allow the company to eventually launch its brand via a partnership with one of its existing North American partners.</p>
<p>The new licenses will help the company expand its continuously growing US presence. The company entered the local market five years ago and has existing licenses in New Jersey and Iowa. GiG noted that its expanding US footprint and its steady operations in Ontario cement its position as a tier 1 platform and sportsbook provider in North America.</p>
<p>GiG’s Leadership Is Thrilled</p>
<p>GiG executives commented on the major development.</p>
<p>Claudio Caruana, general counsel for Gaming Innovation Group, said that the company remains focused on expanding in regulated markets. As a result, his team is “understandably pleased” with the confirmation of two licenses in two new states, Caruana said.</p>
<p>Regulation will continue to drive the industry in North America, as markets mature, allowing us to support and protect operators and their customers, establishing suitable, robust frameworks for sustainable growth. Claudio Caruana, general counsel, GiG</p>
<p>Marcel Elfersy, Gaming Innovation Group’s chief commercial officer, also commented on the matter. He noted that the new licenses in markets that he called “very attractive” create many new opportunities for the company. Elfersy added that his team is thrilled to foray into Maryland and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>We’re excited about the possibilities these new states provide, starting with the launch of Crab Sports in Maryland in May on our PAM and sportsbook. Marcel Elfersy, CCO, GiG</p>
<p>2022 was a record-breaking year for GiG, which is now available in more than 30 markets. The company’s tech is built around easy configuration and event-driven architecture and fueled by agile solutions that are tailored to operators’ needs.</p>
