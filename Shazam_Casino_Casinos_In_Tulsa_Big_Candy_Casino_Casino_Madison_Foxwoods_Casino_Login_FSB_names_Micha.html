<p>FSB Tech, the leading iGaming and sports betting solutions provider for the gambling industry, announced a senior leadership appointment Thursday. The company revealed it appointed Michaela Bonomini, the former GVC Group Head of HR, to the position of Chief People Officer.</p>
<p>Becoming a part of FSB, Bonomini will oversee strategic HR functions within multiple regions. Moreover, she will spearhead the development of strategies and efforts that seek to ensure continued "high employee retention rates."</p>
<p>In a statement released on October 20, 2022, Bonomini said: "FSB's growth into a Tier 1 global supplier over the last 18 months has been hugely impressive and I'm passionate about playing a key role in this continuing growth journey."</p>
<p>The company's new Chief People Officer explained she will collaborate with the senior management team and the employees within different regions. In conclusion, Bonomini pointed out that she will continue FSB's mission by attracting, developing and retaining talented employees.</p>
<p>After three years with GVC Group, Bonomini gained significant experience. During her tenure at the company, she was in charge of different transformative changes. "Bonomini becomes the third former GVC leader to join the EGR Multi-Channel Supplier of the Year after earlier appointments of Global Delivery Director Ken Paterson and former CTO Keith Laidlaw as a key board member," FSB explained in its recent statement.</p>
<p>Dave McDowell, FSB's Chief Executive Officer, added that Bonomini makes an outstanding addition to the executive team of professionals that is being built by the company. He added: "Building a structure around our internal culture and employee benefit program has been a key priority of ours and as our employee numbers continue to grow globally, it was clear we needed to recruit a major industry figure to enable us to execute this across our regions with skill, experience and understanding."</p>
<p>McDowell acknowledged that Bonomini has solid experience within the industry after being a part of GVC. Last but not least, he said that it is thrilling to see Bonomini join FSB's growing team.</p>
<p>This is not the only senior-level appointment announced by FSB. Only recently, the company strengthened its North American team by hiring Keenan Lassor, a leading expert with a solid sports betting background.</p>
<p>Joining FSB, Lassor was appointed Business Development Manager. According to FSB, in his new role, he will collaborate with the company's Business Development team and boost its expansion in the region. Additionally, Lassor's responsibilities include overseeing the sales for commercial and tribal casinos within the region.</p>
