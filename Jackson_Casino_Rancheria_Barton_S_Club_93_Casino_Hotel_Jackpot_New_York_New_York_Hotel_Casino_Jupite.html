<p>Hello I have complaint for silverplay casino .. I open my account here and start playing and won 31832$ and request for withdrawal and also i ask them to put loss limit on my account but after 2 days they ask me that my rollover is not completed so I have to ask them to remove my limit so they told me I have to wait 24 hrs before they remove my limit so I wait 24 hrs and they remove my limit and I complete my rollover.. I request for withdrawal again and ask them to put the loss limit again the yesterday on 18th Aug.. I ask them to remove my limit the guy said the same thing I have to wait 24 hs but right away I change my mind and ask him not to remove my limit and leave it as it is .. so he said okkk but today wen I went to live chat again I ask him to remove my limit .. I thought he will say me same thing to wait 24 hrs so I will think for 24 hrs before finally remove my limit but he Rome the limit right away as they know I won a lot of money and they delaying my process of withdrawal.. so he didn't wait today and he Remove my limit and that end up losing all my winnings as I have the screen shot of all there chat history wen I ask them for first time Live agent told me to wait 24 hrs that is mandatory but wen I ask him on 18th again and I change my mind right away to not to remove my loss limit today he has to give me another 24hrs to rethink but he remove my limit right away because they don't wanna pay and want me to loose they use the responsible gambling tool according to there own benefits and they delay the process of withdrawal so play come and play and loose all the winnings</p>
<p>So I ask the live agent how come he remove the limit he said I ask him tomorrow but I told him I change my mind right away and told u do not remove the limit and he said okk and then I ask him to send me chat history..he denied to send me chat history .. I told him if u saying I didn't change my mind and ask u to leave it don't remove it .. then send me chat history he said no we don't send chat history that's shows he is wrong on his part and after so much arguments he ask me to send email to support team that I already did but then again I went to chat again and ask his colleague to send me chat history and it's my right to ask and have it and then he also started defending his colleague but I told him I don't need to talk about this just send me the history .. so finally he send chat history and I show him were I completely deny after asking him to remove my limit I right away said don't remove my limit buy today he remove my limit so I end up loosing the money today he didn't wait today for 24 hrs as his colleague told me before wen I remove my limit on 16th August for first time it is mandatory to wait 24 hrs before they can remove the limit .. and now this guy didn't wait and make me loose</p>
