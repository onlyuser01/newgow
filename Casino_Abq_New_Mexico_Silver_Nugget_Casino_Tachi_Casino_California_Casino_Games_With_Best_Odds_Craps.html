<p>LeoVegas, a global iGaming operator and a prominent name in the European mobile casino scene, is set to become the Official Training Kit Partner for Wolverhampton, showcasing their brand prominently on the first team's training kit</p>
<p>LeoVegas Group has announced a partnership with the Premier League football club Wolverhampton Wanderers FC for the upcoming 2023/24 season.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Group Teams Up with Wolves to Elevate its International Sports Betting Presence</p>
<p>This strategic collaboration aligns perfectly with LeoVegas Group’s global sports betting ambitions, as the company continues to intensify its focus on sports betting at an international level. The LeoVegas logo will not only adorn the training kit but also grace the club’s double-tier LED perimeter advertising, ensuring maximum visibility during matches.</p>
<p>Sam Behar, director of UK/Ireland and global sponsorship at LeoVegas Group, said: “LeoVegas is proud to partner with Wolves, one of the most established clubs in the Premier League, and we look forward to seeing the partnership kick off with the LeoVegas brand on the front of the training kit as they take on Liverpool at Molineux this weekend.”</p>
<p>This announcement comes on the heels of LeoVegas Group’s recent successes in elevating its global brand presence through key partnerships with football giants such as the 2022/2023 Champions League winners, Manchester City FC, and Champions League finalists FC Internazionale Milano.</p>
<p>Additionally, LeoVegas Group’s Nordic sports betting brand, Expekt, has secured the coveted role of Official Betting Partner for the Danish top football league, 3F Superliga.</p>
<p>LeoVegas’ Commitment to Responsible Gambling Wins Over Wolves</p>
<p>Russell Jones, general manager for marketing and commercial growth at Wolves, expressed his delight in securing this partnership with LeoVegas: “As a well-established and trusted brand with a long history of collaborating with sports teams, we are thrilled that LeoVegas have chosen to add Wolves to their portfolio of successful sports partnerships. Throughout our discussions we have been thoroughly impressed with LeoVegas’ commitment to responsible gambling and the range of tools they have available to help their customers play safe – something which is of paramount importance to the club.”</p>
<p>LeoVegas Group’s journey towards enhanced international recognition has been nothing short of remarkable, especially since being acquired by MGM Resorts International. The company’s influence extends to powering BetMGM’s UK brand, a testament to its growing success in the industry.</p>
<p>In a separate development earlier this month, LeoVegas acquired the majority of game developer Push Gaming Holding Limited, a move aimed at strengthening its content production capabilities and supporting its international growth plans. Push Gaming, known for its digital games for betting and gaming companies, will continue to operate under its existing management team as part of LeoVegas, with the transaction expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2023.</p>
