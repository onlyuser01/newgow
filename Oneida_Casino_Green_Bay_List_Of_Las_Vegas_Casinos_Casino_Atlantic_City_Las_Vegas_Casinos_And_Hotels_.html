    <h1>Oneida Casino Green Bay List Of Las Vegas Casinos Casino Atlantic City Las Vegas Casinos And Hotels</h1>

<p>NetBet has continued to strengthen its presence in various markets, with the company now adding more games from a new supplier to continue its expansion</p>
<p>The prominent operator has teamed up with Platipus, an established studio and developer of online slot content, which will boost the operator’s more than 5,000-game-strong library. Platipus was established in 2014 and it has been one of the most prolific studios in the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>NetBet Brings Platipus Games to Its Library</p>
<p>The company has developed well over 150 titles, among which are such hits as Chilli Fiesta, Royal Lotus, Wild Spin, and others. NetBet is happy to carry forth with this partnership as it allows it to add variety once again to its constantly improving and growing library of titles.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, NetBet PR Claudia Georgevici has said that her company provides an array of experiences that will resonate with players who are part of the operator’s growing community.</p>
<p>NetBet has been in the game for 20 years now with the operator growing rapidly on the content front. Over the past several weeks, NetBet has been able to bring home a string of similar partnerships designed to significantly increase its presence in iGaming.</p>
<p>The operator teamed up with CT Interactive and Inspired Entertainment in the space of just a few weeks this month, making its latest partnership with Platipus part of the company’s busiest months in terms of content alliances.</p>
<p>NetBet has a strong focus on the European market, and Italy in particular, but it has also been growing elsewhere. Romania, a fast-evolving iGaming landscape, has piqued the company’s interest with 7777 launching more than 50 of its games with NetBet in the country</p>
