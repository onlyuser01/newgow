<p>The provider of games, powering the global iGaming industry, Booming Games, announced a new European-facing deal, allowing it to expand the reach of its thrilling games. The company confirmed this week it joined forces with RoyalCasino, a leading online gaming operator for the regulated market in Denmark.</p>
<p>Lauded as a strategic collaboration, the new agreement sees Booming Games agree to provide its games, powering the premier licensed operator. The new strategic alliance significantly expands RoyalCasino's offering to Danish customers. It complements the operator's growth and reaffirms its leadership position considering its more than three decades of experience in the sector.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new partnership, Royalcasino.dk customers are going to be able to access thrilling titles from Booming Games. Besides expanding the operator's offering, the new partnership helps Booming Games propel the reach of its quality content, reaching new customers in Denmark. Moreover, the partnership marks the iGaming provider's entry into the market, promising to deliver unrivaled experiences for Danish customers.</p>
<p>Per Petersen, RoyalCasino's CEO, commented on the topic in a statement by explaining that the company is excited to expand its offering with the addition of titles from a leading provider such as Booming Games. "We’re confident that their games will perfectly cater to our players’ preferences," he added. Finally, Petersen said: "We’re eagerly looking forward to the growth and success of this partnership, which we’re convinced will be advantageous for both sides."</p>
<p>Frederik Niehusen, Booming Games' Chief Commercial Officer, shared the excitement of RoyalCasino's boss. "Our partnership with RoyalCasino, a pioneering name in the gambling sector, signifies a remarkable milestone for our organization," he added.</p>
<p>Niehusen acknowledged RoyalCasino's leadership position within the market in Denmark and its services that stand out with reliability, fairness and safety. Finally, Booming Games' Chief Commercial Officer said: "This collaboration serves to significantly enhance our foothold in the Danish market."</p>
<p>The deal with RoyalCasino in Denmark comes after Booming Games joined forces with JOI Gaming for the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands. Announced earlier this month, the collaboration saw the iGaming provider agree to deliver its content to the company that operates Jacks.nl.</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the most recent deal, RoyalCasino's customers are going to access award-winning and player-favorite games from Booming Games exclusively for an entire week.
