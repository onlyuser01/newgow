<p>Sports betting operators in Nevada can now offer baseball fans wagers on Major League Baseball’s World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) following the decision by the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) last week.</p>
<p>Notification of Terms, Adherence to Audit Procedures</p>
<p>Pursuant to the provisions of Regulation 22.1201, Nevada licensed sportsbooks can post and accept wagers for the winner of the award, provided that they met a set of conditions listed by the state regulator in the announcement.</p>
<p>All licensed sports betting operators in the state willing to offer these wagers would have to inform via email the Enforcement Division within the NGCB with notification of terms. The NGCB did not elaborate on whether terms would need formal approval.</p>
<p>Prior to the first pitch of the World Series, all sportsbooks would have to cease acceptance of wagers on the MVP award winner, while all audit procedures detailed by the regulator in Industry Letter 2011-48 should be adhered to at all times.</p>
<p>Odds Discretion and Availability of Rules</p>
<p>The NGCB noted that the setting of odds would be at the discretion of the individual sports betting operator, which would have to make publicly available all rules governing wagers on the winner of the MLB’s World Series MVP award, while any additional wager which deviates from the winner would require an additional application and approval by the regulator.</p>
<p>The Willie Mays World Series MVP Award, named on the professional baseball center fielder Willie Howard Mays Jr., also known as “The Say Hey Kid”, who had 22 seasons in the MLB with the New York/San Francisco Giants and the New York Mets, is given to the player who had the most impact on his team’s performance in the World Series.</p>
<p>On a side note, a recent decision by the NGCB made it clear that the small Virginia City in Nevada would remain without a land-based gaming facility for the time being, as a past transgression of the person behind the casino application proved to be enough for the regulator to strike down his application.</p>
<p>Vincent Malfitano, a California resident with a shady past featuring obstruction of justice, tax liens, and several lawsuits, attempted to hide his past from the NGCB and get approval for a casino in the town of 780 residents, but the Board denied his application.</p>
