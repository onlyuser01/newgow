    <h1>777 Casino Motor City Hotel And Casino Firelake Casino Sheraton Puerto Rico Hotel And Casino Rivers</h1>

<p>The 2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race is run on Sunday, November 6 at Phoenix Raceway in Arizona. Thirty-six drivers need to pass 312 one-mile laps before finishing the race.</p>
<p>Whoever completes this challenge first is the winner of the race. It can be any of the 36 drivers, but only four of them are still in the race for the 2022 NASCAR title – Joey Logano, Christopher Bell, Ross Chastain, and Chase Elliott.</p>
<p>Rather unsurprisingly, these four drivers are the only ones with betting odds shorter than +1000. The main favorite is Chase Elliott, who’s currently priced at +240. The other three have +400 odds each.</p>

<p>Chase Elliott Going for His Second NASCAR Drivers’ Championship</p>
<p>When Chase Elliott won his first NASCAR Drivers’ Championship in 2020, it happened at Phoenix Raceway. Two years later, he has a chance to do the same.</p>
<p>The good news for his fans is that Elliott seems to love this racetrack. The evidence is that apart from winning the Championship Race two years ago, he also has some good memories from the regular-season races held in Arizona.</p>
<p>Now known as the Ruoff Mortgage 500, this race is pretty much the same as the one that decides the champ. Elliott has competed in this event every season since 2016, finishing in the Top 10 in six of the seven races.</p>
<p>Christopher Bell’s Superb Form Mustn’t be Overlooked</p>
<p>In his third season in the NASCAR Cup Series, Christopher Bell finished the regular season with just enough points to qualify for the Playoffs. He won one race in the regular season and finished on the podium on another two occasions.</p>
<p>However, when the Playoffs started, Bell switched into top gear. He won two races, as well as finished in Top 5 in another three events.</p>
<p>The only reason why Bell isn’t getting even shorter odds by the bookies is that the 27-year-old simply doesn’t have much experience with nerve-wrecking races such as this one.</p>
<p>2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race Prediction</p>
<p>In 2022, Chase Elliott is probably the best NASCAR Cup Series driver. The guy also has plenty of experience and knows how to triumph in big events. On top of everything, he just loves racing at Phoenix Raceway.</p>
<p>We think Elliott is going to finish first on Sunday, but we also think Bell will do well in this race. He might not win, but we can definitely see him get on the podium.</p>
<p>Picks: Chase Elliot to win; Christopher Bell Top 3 finish.</p>
