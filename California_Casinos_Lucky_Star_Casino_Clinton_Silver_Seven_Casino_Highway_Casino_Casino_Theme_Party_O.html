<p>Cazino Cosmos review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Cazino Cosmos is a strange steampunk, space opera world of clockwork animals dressed like Victorian Industrialists and humanoid cats in space helmets. Even more so than most of Yggdrasil Gaming’s output, this one leans heavily into a somewhat obscure world that clearly has its own internal rules but is not quite letting on what they are.</p>
<p>The setting within this world appears to be a space casino floating above a vast purple planet which fills much of the background, while in the foreground, on the reels, the oddball selection of gamblers play cards, sip brandy and flaunt magnificent Teutonic moustaches.</p>
<p>It is a cool place to play your slot games.</p>
<p>Free spins bonus game offers a nice chance to bump up your balance</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The level of graphics is a little plainer than some Yggdrasil Gaming slots, which are notable for being visually extravagant. The backgrounds are impressive, but on the whole, the reel and symbol animations are fairly simple.</p>
<p>Not that simple is bad. In fact, Cazino Cosmos manages to ring some of the most luxurious feeling out of a relatively standard set of tools. The soundtrack is high quality, the animations clean, and the general atmosphere created is decidedly Mississippi steam boat – but in space.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring 10 free spins</p>
<p>The gameplay is somewhat lacklustre. For all the imagination put into its design the gameplay is pretty much what you would expect for a five reel, three row, twenty win line slot machine.</p>
<p>Although it uses the Yggdrasil "Collection Bonus" system, the collection process is particularly slow in this game (compared to games like Vikings Go Berzerk). The range of bonuses is kind of disapponting (see below for details).</p>
<p>Wild symbols lock in place in free spins bonus game</p>
<p>The result is much less varied than you might initially expect given the visuals and the pedigree of this game.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Free Spin symbols award 40 coins for hitting two or more. In addition, they will award free spins for hitting three Free Spin symbols or more. At a rate of ten, fifteen and twenty free spins for three, four and five symbols respectively.</p>
<p>Free spin symbol bonuses and payouts</p>
<p>The Wild symbol plays as any symbol except the Free Spin symbol.</p>
<p>During Free Spins all Wilds are sticky, including any Wilds that were on the reels in spin which triggered the Free Spins.</p>
<p>You can trigger an additional five free spins by landing at least one Wild on every reel.</p>
<p>Additional free spins in the free spins bonus game</p>
<p>There are further bonuses if you fill up the counter at the top of the reel by hitting five of the collectable Wilds on a given row.</p>
<p>Reel 1’s collectable Wilds trigger ten free spins with two sticky Wilds added at random on the first spin.</p>
<p>added at random on the first spin. Reel 2’s collectable bonus is an extra five free spins on top of the Free Spin bonus of ten.</p>
<p>on top of the Free Spin bonus of ten. Reel 3 triggers Zero Gravity Free spins in which the reels are nudged one position up or down wherever this will add a Wild.</p>
<p>wherever this will add a Wild. Reel 4 triggers a chance that all high value symbols might turn into a sticky Wild .</p>
<p>. Reel 5’s collectable is that all the Wild’s that land during the free spins will be stacked two on top of each other.</p>
<p>Wild symbol collections</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>One of the most attractive things about Cazino Cosmos is its high variance which pairs beautifully with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>It may have an industry standard return to player of 96.00%, but this is pretty good for a high variance slot which tend to skew low on the RTP.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested should fit well with any bankroll size ranging as they do from £/$/€0.10 per spin up to a maximum of £/$/€200.00.</p>
<p>Paytable of Cazino Cosmos slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>A world unto itself, this sequel to Cazino Zeppelin takes the next logical step and transports its weird aesthetic into space. The fact that this aesthetic works, coupled with the attractive volatility and reasonable RTP, makes this game a strong recommendation from us.</p>
<p>The only major let down is the rather uninspired gameplay in the main game, which is nicely countered by the range of bonuses.</p>
