<p>Sports betting data specialist IMG ARENA has announced its plans to purchase Leap Gaming, a virtual sports and casino provider. The agreement will help the former company expand its content portfolio and engage fans with thrilling wagering experiences.</p>
<p>Leap Gaming to Become a Part of IMG ARENA</p>
<p>As announced by IMG ARENA, the acquisition of Leap Gaming is expected to close in the first half of 2023. It will see the former company and its team of around 58 people become a part of IMG Arena. Leap Gaming currently supplies solutions to a whopping 120 sportsbooks all over the world and will greatly expand IMG’s reach. However, the agreement is still subject to regulatory approval, IMG ARENA added.</p>
<p>The sports specialist will pair Leap’s state-of-the-art products and technologies with its Event Centre portfolio, allowing it to provide sports betting companies and federations with an improved content portfolio. By acquiring Leap, IMG ARENA will also get access to 3D and motion capture technologies and other high-quality products.</p>
<p>The M&amp;A deal expands IMG ARENA and Leap Gaming’s existing partnership. It will help the two companies usher in a new age of virtual sports by adding official logos, team names, venues and a plethora of branded assets. The parties have already launched official virtual sports betting products with NASCAR and EuroLeague.</p>
<p>A Natural Union Born Out of Synergies</p>
<p>Per the agreement, Yariv Lissauer, chief executive of Leap, will be named as senior director and general manager of iGaming at IMG Arena. He spoke about the new agreement, calling the merger a “natural union born out of synergies in product, customer base, culture and vision.” He noted that the deal will allow the two companies to combine their expertise, capabilities and resources to deliver superior virtual sports products.</p>
<p>Freddie Longe, IMG ARENA’s president, also spoke on the deal. He pointed out that his company has long believed in Leap Gaming’s vision and has been working with the company for the past four years. Longe said that he is happy to evolve this partnership into something more. He concluded:</p>
<p>The acquisition will enable us to build on the work we have already done with Leap to take the virtual sports experience to new levels and continue to enhance our sports betting content portfolio. Freddie Longe, president, IMG ARENA</p>
<p>IMG ARENA is a company that provides operators and federations with broadcasts and data feeds from 45,000 sports events a year. It also delivers content for virtual sports products and offers a variety of front-end solutions to its partners.</p>
<p>A few days ago, IMG ARENA expanded its relationship with PointsBet, agreeing to provide the company with its Golf Event Center.</p>
