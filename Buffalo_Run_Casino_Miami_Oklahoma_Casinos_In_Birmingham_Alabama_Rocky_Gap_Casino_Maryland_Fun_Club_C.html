    <h1>Buffalo Run Casino Miami Oklahoma Casinos In Birmingham Alabama Rocky Gap Casino Maryland Fun Club C</h1>

<p>Spelinspektionen, the Swedish Gambling Authority, has banned Ease Gaming N.V. from any gambling activities on the Swedish market. Following a check of the website branded Casineia and operated by Ease Gaming it turned out it was offering online gambling games directed to Swedish customers without a license.</p>
<p>Ease Gaming Operated Without the Compulsory Gaming License</p>
<p>The Swedish Gambling Authority Spelinspektionen has issued a ban against Ease Gaming N.V. and the message is clear. The Curacao-based company does not have a Swedish gambling license and is, therefore, not allowed to conduct gambling operations in Sweden. Spelinspektionen’s decision has immediate effect.</p>
<p>During an inspection of the Casineia brand, the Swedish Gambling Authority noticed that Ease Gaming N.V. conducts gambling operations in Sweden without a valid license. This is obvious as the casino has information in Swedish, it is possible to register an account in Sweden, there is Swedish-speaking customer support and the casino markets itself to Swedish players with banners in Swedish. All of this goes against Swedish gambling regulations.</p>
<p>As a result, the Swedish Gambling Authority chose to officially ban the company from operating in Sweden.</p>
<p>What Does the Decision of the Swedish Gambling Authority Entail?</p>
<p>Ease Gaming N.V. is registered in Curacao and is the owner of four online casinos: Casineia, SlotHive, Gamblii, and JinxCasino.</p>
<p>The fact that the Swedish Gambling Authority has prohibited the company from conducting gambling operations in Sweden, however, does not mean that the websites will automatically be shut down. It is up to the company to respect the regulator’s decision.</p>
<p>As Ease Gaming is not based within the European Union, it is not possible to demand any sanctions or pursue the matter legally. The Swedish Gambling Authority simply hopes that the ban will lead to Swedish players not choosing to play at these online casinos.</p>
<p>All Gambling Operators Offering Services in Sweden are Subject to the Swedish Gaming Act</p>
<p>The Swedish Gaming Act is based on the principle that companies operating on the Swedish market must have a license. This is to ensure that the gambling operators that are active in Sweden are responsible, controllable, and reliable.</p>
<p>The law is applied to all forms of gambling that are provided within Sweden – regardless of whether the operator is based in another country. If an online casino offers Swedish currency, Swedish-speaking customer service, or if it is possible to select Sweden as the country of residence in the registration form, the company in question operates in Sweden. Thus, it is subject to the provisions of the Swedish Gaming Act.</p>
