<p>AC Milan vs. PSG is arguably the most interesting Champions League duel scheduled for Tuesday, November 7, 2023. The game is played at San Siro in Milan where the hosts are undefeated against the boys from Paris</p>
<p>AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain are two teams from the “group of death” of the 2023 UEFA Champions League. In addition to these two, Group F also features Dortmund and Newcastle, two teams that are higher in the standings than AC Milan. Paris SG is the leader of the group table, which explains why the French are seen as the favorites in the November 7 game.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, the two meet again, but this time, AC Milan is the host. The game is played at Italy’s largest stadium, which could mean a lot for the hosts. With the help of their fans, their players are likely to be fired up, especially offensively.</p>
<p>They’re going to charge toward the PSG goal trying to find the net for the first time in the Champions League this season. Stefano Pioli’s men aren’t great offensively in this competition, but they have been doing alright in the Serie A.</p>
<p>It’s because they have some really good attackers on the roaster in 2023 – Olivier Giroud, Rafael Leao, Christian Pulisic, and so on.</p>
<p>PSG Hoping for Another Great Performance</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, PSG defeated AC Milan 3-0, with goals scored by Kylian Mbappe, Randal Kolo Muani, and Kang-In Lee. Warren Zaire-Emery recorded two assists that day, while the third was the work of Ousmane Dembele.</p>
<p>The Parisians did well defensively that day as well, with Gianluigi Donnarumma keeping a clean sheet for the second time this season in the UCL. The first time it happened was when they defeated Dortmund 2-0 at home.</p>
<p>The only time they played on the road in the Champions League this season, they lost 4-1 to Newcastle. Is this something that should worry them ahead of their trip to Italy? Well, they do have a relatively bad record against AC Milan in away matches. However, the two have met only twice at San Siro so far, the most recent of which happened in 2001.</p>
<p>AC Milan vs. PSG Prediction</p>
<p>AC Milan needs to win this game to stay in the race for a spot in the next stage of the Champions League. They’ve got a good squad, which can do great on the big stage, especially when playing at home. With the support of their fans at San Siro, they definitely stand a chance to beat PSG.</p>
<p>Pick: AC Milan to win</p>
