<p>Germany Coming Off a Win Over Team US</p>
<p>The United States men’s national basketball team was the No. 1 favorite to win the 2023 FIBA World Cup before the start of the tournament. Until Friday, it seemed as if the bookies were right to favor the Americans. But then, Team US lost to Germany 113-111.</p>
<p>It was a close win for the Germans especially after Team US players switched to the top gear in the final couple of minutes of the game. But Germany was able to survive, mostly thanks to its players’ brilliant offensive output.</p>

<p>Truth be told, the Americans didn’t seem too interested in the defense, which allowed Germany to score so many points. In fact, 113 points is the most these guys have scored in a game since 2014 when they beat Luxemburg 118-66.</p>
<p>Should you expect the Germans to continue their offensive brilliance and score as many points in the 2023 FIBA World Cup? Not really. After all, they’re playing against a team with arguably the most disciplined defense in the world.</p>
<p>Svetislav Pesic Preparing Another Basketball Masterclass</p>
<p>When you think of Serbian basketball, your mind probably goes straight to Nikola Jokic. But “Joker” isn’t with the Serbia national team in the Philippines. Instead, this team’s biggest star is Bogdan Bogdanovic, who’s been getting limited time on the court in the NBA as an Atlanta Hawks shooting guard.</p>
<p>Bogdan Bogdanovic continued his hot streak on offense to push Serbia to the Final and earn TCL Player of the Game honors 🔥</p>

<p>This team might not be packed with superstars, but Serbia works great as a collective. This isn’t surprising given that the team is coached by Svetislav Pesic, a 74-year-old coach who won a World Cup in 2002 while at the helm of former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>After winning the 2002 World Cup in Indianapolis, Pesic coached a number of elite European clubs, including Bayern Munich, where he stayed for nearly four years. Further, at one point in his career, he was even the head coach of the Germany national basketball team.</p>
<p>2023 FIBA World Cup Final Prediction</p>
<p>With Pesic as their coach, the Serbs have every right to hope for a good result on Sunday. If there’s a man who can prepare a strategy needed to beat the Germans in the final, it’s him. Plus, you can be 100% certain that his boys are going to give everything on the court of the Mall of Asia Arena. It’s not just about becoming the champions of the world, it’s also about making their struggling friend happy.</p>
<p>What we’re talking about is that the Serbs want to win the FIBA World Cup for their teammate Borisa Simanic who suffered such a horrible injury in Serbia’s game against South Sudan that doctors had to remove his kidney.</p>
<p>Pick: Serbia to win</p>
