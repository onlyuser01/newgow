<p>Games Global has announced a Betway player hit a €13.5 million ($14.7 million) progressive jackpot on Book of Mega Moolah on December 25, 2023</p>
<p>The leading provider of innovative iGaming content boasting over 1000 exclusive games, a record-breaking progressive jackpot network, and 36 exclusive studios, Games Global, has announced Christmas Eve has been particularly merry for a Betway player.</p>
<p>The supplier that hosts a premium distribution channel that services more than 900 global gaming brands reported the lucky gambler landed a €13.5 million ($14.7 million) progressive jackpot on Book of Mega Moolah.</p>
<p>The news comes just days after the provider announced its progressive jackpot WowPot! has also been hit on Wheel of Wishes on December 20, 2023.</p>
<p>The €38,461,200.95 jackpot surpassed the previous online jackpot record win of €19.4 million ($21.1 million) hit on Games Global’s progressive jackpot Mega Moolah, becoming the largest ever amount to be awarded on an online slot.</p>
<p>In July, Games Global launched King Millions, a network jackpot with prizes going over the $33 million mark.</p>
<p>A Lucky €20 ($21.8) Bet</p>
<p>The winner only needed a €20 ($21.6) bet on the game to scoop up the big progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>Book of Mega Moolah is one of Games Global’s freshest releases encompassing their iconic Mega Moolah progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>The slot’s popularity and traction have been on a constant rise trend since it went live with operators just three months ago, with most players appreciating the mesmerizing mix between the timeless Mega Moolah experience and the standard “book of” formula.</p>
<p>Now, the fresh win counting eight figures is expected to further help the game stand out in Games Global’s versatile portfolio of jackpot slots.</p>
<p>The win is the eighth-biggest online slots prize in history, with numerous other important multimillion-euro wins awarded to players across Games Global’s progressive jackpot network.</p>
<p>Betway, “Thrilled” to See a New Customer Grab a Multimillion-Euro Jackpot</p>
<p>Betway’s dedication to offering state-of-the-art entertainment to its customers has been well supported by Mega Moolah’s ability to provide substantial wins and engaging gameplay over the years.</p>
<p>In October 2015, another Betway player in the UK won a €17.8 million ($19.4 million) prize on the Mega Moolah.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news of the latest win, Betway Group’s chief executive officer, Anthony Werkman, expressed their thrill for being able to once again witness one of their players “take home a staggering multimillion-euro jackpot prize, again won on Mega Moolah, one of our most popular titles.”</p>
<p>Werkman also mentioned their previous Guinness World Record for the “Largest payout in an online slot machine game” while strengthening their commitment to offering new, engaging, and versatile offerings in conjunction with Games Global.</p>
<p>Games Global’s chief product officer, Andy Booth, took the opportunity to express their absolute thrill at the news of the latest winning experience that took place on Christmas Eve while also congratulating the winner and expressing their eagerness to make more winners in the future.</p>
<p>In 2023, Games Global’s reputable network of progressive jackpots boasted a new win every 10 seconds on average.</p>
<p>In December, the company signed an agreement with Nailed It! Games for the global release of Cosmic Coins, a new slot featuring the Epic Strike mechanic honoring retro AWP machines.</p>
<p>During the same month, Games Global announced an expansion of an existing strategic agreement with Betsson Group.</p>
