<p>Online gaming and sports betting brand Tebwin scored another UK sports partnership deal after teaming up with Gallagher Premiership rugby club Worcester Warriors to become the team’s official betting partner.</p>
<p>Second Sports Partnership in the UK</p>
<p>The sports deal Tebwin signed with the Warriors comes only months after the brand operated by King J. Entertainment partnered with English Football League (EFL) soccer club Queens Park Rangers FC for the 2021-22 season in the Championship.</p>
<p>“Delighted to join the Tebwin sports portfolio and work hand-in-glove” with the sports betting brand, Warriors commercial director Adam Palfrey outlined the opportunities “to develop additional excitement around the Warriors brand.”</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Tebwin.com will help Worcester Warriors to engage fans in responsible and innovative ways this season as the sports betting landscape continues to offer amusement and fun as well as enhancing the fans experience.” Adam Palfrey, Commercial Director, Worchester Warriors</p>
<p>Under the terms of the partnership that will see Tebwin’s support of UK sports increase, the brand’s logo will feature at Sixways Stadium, home of the Warriors, as well as with other promotional material. Tebwin will also become hosts for key home matches of the Warriors.</p>
<p>‘Highly-Charged Atmosphere’</p>
<p>Pearl Dougall, business manager at Tebwin’s parent King J. Entertainment, explained the brand had chosen “one of England’s most famous rugby teams” as its partner due to the belief that Tebwin’s “brand equity will add to the highly-charged atmosphere” around the team and will additionally increase “interest in results week-in and week-out.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to working closely with Worcester Warriors and seeing the team flourish in all competitions.” Pearl Dougall, Business Manager, King J. Entertainment</p>
<p>Tebwin, a sportsbook and online casino brand that was launched this year ahead of the Euro 2020, is part of the gaming portfolio of King J. Entertainment, alongside King J. Casino and BetDuel brands, operating under licenses from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>Central to Tebwin’s sports betting operations are player protection and the sportsbook is actively promoting the services provided by BeGambleAware and GamStop. Accordingly, the betting brand will ensure its communication is tailored to put responsible gambling to the top of all of its advertising and content.</p>
<p>Despite its younger age, Tebwin was short-listed for the 2021 SBC Awards to join a group of prominent operators like Betsson Group, LeoVegas, Sportradar, BetConstruct, BtoBet, Pragmatic Play, and others.</p>
