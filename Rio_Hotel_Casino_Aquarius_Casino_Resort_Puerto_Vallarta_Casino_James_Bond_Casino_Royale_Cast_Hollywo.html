    <h1>Rio Hotel Casino Aquarius Casino Resort Puerto Vallarta Casino James Bond Casino Royale Cast Hollywo</h1>

<p>Checkd Group, an expanding iGaming and sports betting business, has made an important technological leap by incorporating AI-powered voice recognition software into its signature Betting Hub app. The process was handled by Checkd Group’s dedicated in-house tech division Checkd Dev, Casino Guru News learnt via press release shared on email.</p>
<p>Checkd Group will significantly strengthen its customer journey by offering bettors the opportunity to simply speak into the Betting Hub app and look up and place a selection on a contest they want to. Voxbet is a powerful solution that enables players to navigate the overwhelming variety of online betting markets and home in on those that they are interested in.</p>
<p>This makes for a quick and simplified betting process that is spearheaded by Voxbet’s unique technology that enables a new type of wagering. This also comes at a particularly important time for the company in the United Kingdom and the United States, with more details coming out about the expected FlashPicks sports betting app – a new product by the company.</p>
<p>Checkd Group is keen to continue progressing by leveraging both this new technology and expanding its product base. Checkd Dev Managing Director Adam Patton has welcomed the opportunity to strengthen the Betting Hubb with cutting-edge technology such as the product provided by Voxbet.</p>
<p>With the addition of voice search, bets are made even simpler, argued Patton, who hailed the opportunity to further streamline the process for bettors. There has been a lot of positive feedback, the Managing Director added, suggesting that Checkd Group is on the right track with this new best-in-class solution.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Patton is confident that the technology is an outstanding product both for customers and partner operators. Meanwhile, Voxbet CEO Jonathan Power argued that Betting Hub is by itself an impressive tool that provides relevant information.</p>
<p>"Given its strong partnerships with tier-one operators, it is fantastic to be able to integrate our Voxbet tool to further streamline the betting journey. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with Checkd Group," Powers argued, touting the strength of voice search and the new leaf that this technology is turning into the sports betting ecosystem.</p>
<p>Power has been similarly pleased with the entire process. He has previously given various interviews in which he detailed how Voxbet works and how it adds true value to companies. On one of those occasions, Power said that sportsbooks can be overwhelming and hard to navigate, something that Voxbet set out to tackle.</p>
