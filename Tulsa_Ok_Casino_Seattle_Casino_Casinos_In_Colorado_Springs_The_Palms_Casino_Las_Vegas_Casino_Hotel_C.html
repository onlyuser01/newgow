    <h1>Tulsa Ok Casino Seattle Casino Casinos In Colorado Springs The Palms Casino Las Vegas Casino Hotel C</h1>

<p>Good evening. I opened an account with nomini on the 10th of the 22nd. I collected some money. I make the first withdrawal request, everything is accepted. After two days, I make the second one and they ask me for information to do identification. They want identification back and forth. account in my name. I'm telling them I don't have an account in my name because I live with my parents. In the categories they accepted it also said mobile account. That's what I did, I sent the mobile account that is in my name. The communication with this betting company it took several weeks during which they never accepted my supporting documents for no reason. after many attempts to ask them to tell me exactly what they want and they don't accept what I send, they kept telling me the same things over and over with the result that I was never able to I took the 1000 euros that I had in my account and they took it from me. I gave what was needed as far as the documents are concerned. I don't know what to do really. It's a shame because it's not 20 euros. You can say it doesn't matter, it's 1000. I'm a student, I've worked and the I've won, it's unfair, and after all, it's money that's in great need</p>
<p>.I would be grateful if you could help me</p>
