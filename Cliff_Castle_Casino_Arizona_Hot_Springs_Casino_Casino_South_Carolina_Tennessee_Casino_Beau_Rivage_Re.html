<p>The leading developers will build on their mutual expertise to deliver a world-class product that will unify the WynnBet experience under a single solution</p>
<p>White Hat and mkodo already maintain an existing and fruitful partnership, significantly bolstering their ability to coordinate on the new project. As part of White Hat’s PAM agreement with WynnBet, the supplier appointed mkodo as the app’s official front-end developer. The two companies’ leadership teams lauded the new partnership opportunity, hoping to extend their cooperation into future projects.</p>
<p>More than the Sum of Their Parts</p>
<p>As a leading gaming and betting solutions provider, White Hat was the natural choice to develop WynnBet’s next-generation app. The developer has a strong track record of partnering with leading brands and operators to launch new products and services. Its rising popularity allowed the company to rapidly expand across several North American jurisdictions and become WynnBet’s exclusive US PAM provider.</p>
<p>White Hat is also unafraid to leverage its partnerships, relying on mkodo for several vital features of the new app. The UK-based iGaming will refine the new solution’s quality, reliability, and useability, leveraging its geolocation and biometric login technology. White Hat appointed mkodo as the project’s primary front-end developer, displaying significant trust in their ongoing partnership.</p>
<p>WynnBet Will Receive a Cutting-Edge Solution</p>
<p>The two companies’ development teams were eager to cooperate on such a milestone project. mkodo managing director Stuart Godfree was excited to help deliver a new and exciting sports betting app showcasing the company’s leading solutions. He thanked White Hat for the opportunity, promising a smooth player experience across retail and digital.</p>
<p>White Hat delivers a market-leading iGaming platform, and working alongside its team… has allowed us to leverage our insight and powerful products. Stuart Godfree, mkodo managing director</p>
<p>WynnBet’s new app will be the pinnacle of both developers’ technologies, allowing players to move freely across states and seamlessly bet in legalized jurisdictions. CEO Phil Gelvan lauded mkodo for their significant contribution to the project. He was keen to extend their cooperation to future projects, helping both companies reach new heights.</p>
<p>By choosing mkodo’s services alongside our superior PAM offering, we are confident that we can offer WynnBet and its players a seamless and user-friendly sportsbook experience. Phil Gelvan, White Hat Gaming CEO</p>
<p>The updated WynnBet app will launch in Massachusetts in Q2 2023, eventually spreading to all jurisdictions where the operator is active. It comes at a time of rapid growth in the US sportsbook market, with more and more states legalizing and regulating online sports betting. The developers’ consistent history of success bodes well for the new solution, which will likely be instrumental in preserving WynnBet’s leading market position.</p>
