    <h1>Twin Pine Casino Hotel Best Free Casino Games Red Wind Casino Turtle Lake Casino Hotel Topeka Casino</h1>

<p>PointsBet Canada has signed a multi-year deal with sports and real estate company Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (MLSE). According to the agreement, PointsBet will become one of MLSE’s official sports betting partners.</p>
<p>The New Partnership Is Historic</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada’s chief executive officer Scott Vanderwel called the new agreement a “historic deal”, adding that partnering with an organization that covers all four professional leagues is a rare occasion. He also referred to PointsBet’s rich plethora of sports market entertainment options available throughout the year that makes the new agreement innovative and exciting.</p>
<p>MLSE’s senior vice president of global partnerships, Jordan Vader, was equally excited to welcome the Canadian branch of PointsBet as a partner for the Maple Leafs, Toronto Football Club, Toronto Raptors, and Toronto Argos as they are making their way into Ontario’s sports betting market and bringing in their flawless reputation into the industry.</p>
<p>Vader also added that the company is looking forward to offering sports aficionados fresh and unique options to interact and engage with their favorite sports and teams via a reputable operator that puts responsible gaming first.</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada currently spans the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Football Club, Toronto Raptors, and the Toronto Argonauts. MLSE has an equally impressive portfolio consisting of the Toronto Maple Leafs, a National Hockey League team, the Toronto Raptors, a National Basketball Association franchise, Toronto Football Club, a Major League Soccer team, the Toronto Argonauts, a Canadian Football League team, and the Toronto Marlies, an American Hockey League team. MLSE also has a series of important assets in Ontario.</p>
<p>PointsBet Took the First Bet 50 Seconds After the Ontario Market Launched</p>
<p>Ontario opened it online gambling and sports betting market on April 4, and PointsBet Canada was one of the first operators to go live after receiving the green light from Ontario’s Alcohol and Gaming Commission subsidiary on March 24. The operator marked the launch by taking its first bet in less than a minute.</p>
<p>The Australian Stock Exchange-listed sportsbook runs operations in the US, Australia, Ireland, and Canada and works with a scalable betting platform based on cloud technology. Customers can enjoy highly innovative sports betting products, along with excellent iGaming options and advanced deposit solutions for wagering on races.</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada’s chief commercial officer Nic Sulsky called MLSE’s franchises some of the most iconic Canadian teams, expressing his excitement to be joining the organization where delivering championships belongs to their DNA. At the end of last week, MLSE signed a similar deal with FanDuel and PokerStars, making FanDuel Sportsbook its official sports betting partner and PokerStars its official gaming partner. PokerStars also announced its collaboration with regulatory bodies in Ontario for the launch of an online poker offering on the newly regulated market.</p>
