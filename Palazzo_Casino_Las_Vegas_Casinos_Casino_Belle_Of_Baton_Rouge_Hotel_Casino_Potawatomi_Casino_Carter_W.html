    <h1>Palazzo Casino Las Vegas Casinos Casino Belle Of Baton Rouge Hotel Casino Potawatomi Casino Carter W</h1>

<p>Hello, I played at the casino HotLine and I wanted to get verified. On October 7, I received a letter saying my account was blocked. My $422 money has also been blocked.</p>
<p>In the letter, the casino employee refers to the rule:</p>
<p>Paragraph 2.2 of the Terms and Conditions: 2.2 You may only have one Account. Only one Account is allowed at one address, IP, from one computer. If you try to create more than one Account, all accounts you open will be blocked or closed, and rates will be canceled.</p>
<p>I have carefully reviewed the terms and conditions of Hot Line Casino. I understand that they can block accounts for various violations. Hot Line Casino indicated that I violated clause 2.2. I didn't break that rule. I don't have a second account, no one used my IP. Also casino have to provide evidence of violation of the rules. Charges without grounds are illegal in any country. I do not want to create a big conflict, I ask the casino to return my $422 and leave my account close. I still don't want to play in this casino anymore, because I'm disappointed with their actions.</p>
