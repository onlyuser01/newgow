    <h1>Thunder Valley Casino Resort Athens Avenue Lincoln Ca Casino Murphy North Carolina Boyd Gaming Casin</h1>

<p>Just to clarify, I don't live in Puerto Rico. I made a deposit via credit card on September 12, which was denied. However, my card account showed it as pending, and the funds disappeared the following day. This credit card is not from my house bank but a bank in Luxembourg, so the money doesn't get deducted from my regular bank account but from the credit card account of the other bank. Almost an hour was spent chatting with them because they insisted on a bank statement from my bank. But this scenario doesn't even involve my bank, and my account reflects a deduction of 90 Euros. I don't receive statements from the bank in Luxembourg with my IBAN on them since I don't have an account there, except the aforementioned credit card account. I sent them a screenshot showing the service provider 'Embily Services' where the 90 Euros were withdrawn. They told me they needed a reference number and that was two weeks ago. I called the bank in Luxembourg today and asked them to send me an email confirming that the mentioned provider received 90 Euros. Still, the casino won't accept it as proof that the provider received the money. They now tell me they don't need the reference number but a bank statement with my name and IBAN on it. I explained my situation again, but it seems they are not interested in understanding it. I did provide an older account statement from my card account since I will not be getting a new one for another two weeks. However, they said they cannot proceed with it and are awaiting an account statement with the IBAN. Now, I don't know what I should do since I don't have an account there. Screenshot 483 contains two deposits made on September 20 and three on September 19 from the provider 'Virtualus.' I've made many deposits there but only noticed Embily Services once when the 90 Euros were debited. It's also interesting that each provider is marked with a symbol accompanied by 'Entertainment.' However, Embily Services is marked with a question mark accompanied by 'Miscellaneous.' I couldn't attach the file from Embily Services.</p>
