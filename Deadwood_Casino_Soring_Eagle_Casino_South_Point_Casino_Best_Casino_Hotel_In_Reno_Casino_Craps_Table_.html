    <h1>Deadwood Casino Soring Eagle Casino South Point Casino Best Casino Hotel In Reno Casino Craps Table</h1>

<p>Publisher of horseracing content and provider of wagering tips for the UK and global events Seven Star Digital has acquired Moneta Communications, a pure-play performance marketing business that publishes sports betting content in North America, the UK, and Ireland. The fresh deal will help Seven Star Digital strengthen its foothold in the UK. The acquisition comes in the context of the company planning to make its growth in “mature gambling markets” a top priority.</p>
<p>Seven Star Digital, a Reputable Name in the English Market</p>
<p>As explained by Seven Star Digital’s chief executive officer Jack Lodge, Seven Star has been successfully putting the UK market at the foundation of its growth and success for the past five years. The addition of Moneta Communications to its portfolio is therefore expected to “solidify” its positioning in this market even more, with special emphasis on its much-anticipated expansion in the sports betting market.</p>
<p>Lodge added that the fresh “synergies” that will be triggered by sharing the company’s “operational expertise” will also stimulate the growth of Moneta Communications in the highly competitive market that is the UK.</p>
<p>Big Plans for the North American Market</p>
<p>OneTwenty-owned Seven Star Digital also has big expansion plans for the North American market, with particular attention given to the US, a place where bettingodds.com and horseracing.net have already managed to make a name for themselves. These plans will be put into practice by the same talented team that has helped the business grow in the past decade and a half. Bettingodds.com is a known publisher of content revolving around odds. The platform offers the best odds for all types of sports throughout all markets, including North America, the UK, and Africa. On the other hand, horseracing.net manages to gather more than four million visits on a yearly basis, thanks to its online content that assists consumers with finding and wagering on the best international as well as UK-based horse racing events.</p>
<p>OneTwenty’s chief executive officer Chris Russell expressed his excitement in regards to adding the Manchester-based team to their UK and global brand. He added that the company’s focus is now to leverage “great engagement business” with the help of their “pure-play performance marketing DNA.”</p>
<p>The much-anticipated White Paper that was supposed to review the Gambling Act 2005 at the end of 2021 but which suffered numerous delays and pushbacks may never turn into a palpable reality. According to rumors related to UK’s newly-elected Prime Minister Liz Truss and her new chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, the duo seems to be determined to first promote growth and securitize anything related to additional regulation. The review of the gambling Act 2005 review is expected to add a new burden on businesses while stifling growth instead of promoting it. This is something that the new Prime Minister wants to avoid, which means the White Paper may continue to remain a simple dream for many.</p>
