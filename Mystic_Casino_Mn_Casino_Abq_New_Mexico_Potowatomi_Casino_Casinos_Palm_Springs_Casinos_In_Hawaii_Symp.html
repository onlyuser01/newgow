<p>Symplify, a company that specializes in the delivery of innovative AI cloud and CRM solutions, has signed a new and important partnership with AdmiralBet in Serbia, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release. AdmiralBet is one of the leading iGaming and betting platforms in the country and will benefit from the dynamic solutions brought around by Symplify.</p>
<p>AdmiralBet will further receive a boost in the way that the company engages and interacts with its core audience, as Symplify is bringing innovative tech solutions such as email, SMS, dynamic web, and browser push, all of which are designed to improve an operator’s ability to engage with their audiences and drive meaningful experiences across the board.</p>
<p>Apart from these options, Symplify will also utilize its Campaign and Journey builder options which will be introduced to AdmiralBet and further enhance the company’s ability to drive meaningful and worthwhile results across the board.</p>
<p>The opportunity was of course welcomed on both sides, with Robert Kimber, Symplify’s Chief Executive Officer, remarking that AdmiralBet was a gaming and betting platform that is well known for its intuitive iGaming solutions and has thus established itself as a leader in Serbia. Kimber also hailed what Symplify brings to the table as well.</p>
<p>"Our cloud-based CRM and AI ecosystem will help AdmiralBet to enhance business growth by fostering deeper player engagement," he noted.</p>
<p>As to AdmiralBet, the company’s Head of Online Operations, Milan Djurmez, said that thanks to Symplify’s CRM options, AdmiralBet is expected to enjoy a much stronger growth across the board. "We expect to immediately reap the benefits of being able to better engage with our community by showcasing the strength of our product," Djurmez added.</p>
<p>AdmiralBet has definitely made headlines with the company securing various partnerships with content aggregators and platform solutions over the past months. AdmiralBet previously teamed up with Swintt in a bid to increase its iGaming library. PartnerMatrix, another provider of excellent solutions for gaming operators, also teamed up with AdmiralBet last year.</p>
<p>Overall, Symplify has been building a reputation for itself, sending a clear message to potential partners – "get hold of your own data." The company has made a point of how leveraging data can help individual operators and clients build a stronger proposition with Symplify’s own products. Symplify also meets some of the highest responsible gambling criteria, making it a reliable and trusted overall partner to AdmiralBet and beyond.</p>
