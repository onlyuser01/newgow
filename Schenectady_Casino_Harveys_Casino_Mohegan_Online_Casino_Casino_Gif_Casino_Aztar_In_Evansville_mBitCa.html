<p>Hi Kevin! We understand your concerns and would love to help you sort this out.</p>
<p>As part of the account creation process, you were asked if you agreed to our Terms and Conditions. By clicking on the checkbox, you confirmed that you have read the Terms and Conditions, accepted them, and are fully bound by them. The Terms and Conditions are public and can be accessed here: https://www.mbitcasino.io/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>According to point 2.2, users are solely responsible for determining whether accessing and/or using our website is compliant with applicable laws in their jurisdiction. Therefore, any claim against us brought for any reason in regard to this will be considered void.</p>
<p>Point 2.3 of the Terms and Conditions also includes the list of Restricted Countries, including the United States of America and its territories. We cannot guarantee the successful processing of withdrawals or refunds if a player breaches this Restricted Countries policy.</p>
<p>According to our logs, the user was never informed that they should not fill out their profile information.</p>
<p>The user asked if verification was required and he was informed that it was not mandatory, unless requested. The verification was not requested as, being a cryptocurrency casino, users can play anonymously.</p>
<p>Finally, before we can move forward with the case, we would like to verify the user's identity in order to verify the claims. Kevin, you will be notified of the next steps at the email address submitted on CasinoGuru.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
