<p>James Packer Focus of Israeli Netanyahu Probe, Ex-Fiancee Mariah Carey Not Feeling Any Pain</p>

<p>Australian billionaire casino mogul James Packer probably hasn’t had his best week ever. First, 19 employees of his company, Crown Resorts, were sent to prison in China for committing “gambling crimes” on behalf of the company, a fact that has severely embarrassed Crown and could trigger licensing reviews back home in Australia.</p>

<p>Next, it emerges that Israeli police want to interview Packer as part of a corruption investigation into gifts he allegedly lavished upon his friend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>And then his ex-fiancee, the internationally acclaimed pop-soul diva Mariah Carey, goes and calls him a “motherf***er!” on live TV. Like we said: it’s been a tough week.</p>
<p>Gifted Exchanges</p>
<p>But more of Mimi later. First Bibi, and the news that Packer will be helping Israeli police with their inquiries into the prime minister, who has been accused of accepting too many gifts from wealthy businessmen recently, something which, as a head of state, could have serious implications.</p>
<p>While Packer himself is not accused of any wrongdoing, he has certainly been cozying up to Netanyahu, allegedly treating him to free flights on his private jet. He also reportedly showered Netanhayu’s wife, Sara, with Mariah Carey tickets (pre-break-up) and even gave some to Yossi Cohen, the top gun at Mossad. Yair Netanhayu, the prime minister’s son, also received gifts and a stay in a swank New York hotel, all paid for by Packer.</p>
<p>This was around the time that Packer began looking to establish residency in Israel, and police want to know whether Netanyahu helped grease the skids on his application. Packer bought a home next to Netanyahu in the coastal city of Caesarea and is reportedly seeking residency status for tax purposes, according to the Times of Israel.</p>
<p>Mariah’s Two Cents</p>
<p>So what does Mariah Carey have to say about all this? As luck would have it, she happened to be in Israel this week to promote her new partnership with a local skin care line, so the country’s Channel 2 News decided to find out.</p>
<p>“I don’t know where the motherf**er is,” she snapped. “How am I supposed to know? I really have no idea about the political stuff that goes on. I don’t. I don’t pay attention to it.”</p>
<p>On being informed that free tickets to her shows had become a crucial part of the controversy, she replied. “Oh, now they want to blame me? Someone wants to blame me for something now? What did I do? I didn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>Coincidentally, that’s exactly what Netanhayu is saying about the whole rigmarole.</p>
