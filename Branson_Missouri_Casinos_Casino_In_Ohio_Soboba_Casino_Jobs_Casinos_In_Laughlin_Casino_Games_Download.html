<p>A former lead of the investigative unit of the Missouri State Highway Patrol’s Gaming Division, Aylward has robust experience in the supervision of gaming operations</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the United Arab Emirates founded the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), a newly formed regulatory body that would oversee the gaming sector. Headed by chairman Jim Murren and CEO Kevin Mullally, the authority continues to build up its team and has now onboarded a new important member.</p>
<p>The person in question is Edward Aylward, a former US lieutenant. As reported by Aylward himself on LinkedIn, he will now join the GCGRA as its head of investigations.</p>
<p>I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Head of Investigations at General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority! Edward Aylward, head of investigations, GCGRA</p>
<p>A former lead of the investigative unit of the Missouri State Highway Patrol’s Gaming Division, Aylward has robust experience in the supervision of gaming operations. During his time as a lieutenant, he supervised over 70 officers who enforced criminal statutes and regulatory authority at 7 casinos.</p>
<p>In addition, Aylward acted as property control, or evidence administrator for the division. His skill set includes experience in administrative management, writing, administrative investigations, law enforcement and background checks.</p>
<p>As a member of the GCGRA, Aylward will leverage three decades of investigative experience to supervise gaming in the United Arab Emirates. The UAE is on the way to welcoming a Wynn property on Al Marjan Island, allowing the country to capitalize on the opportunities offered by the gaming sector.</p>
<p>Dubai Yet to Greenlight Casino Resorts</p>
<p>While the UAE is yet to refer to gaming properties as casinos, the latest developments clearly show that the Emirates are warming up to the gaming industry. Earlier this year, MGM Resorts, which is also eyeing the country, expressed its optimism about the future of gambling in the UAE. Back then, the company said that it was hopeful that the Emirates would legalize gambling very soon.</p>
<p>This contradicted earlier statements by Dubai officials who claimed that it will not legalize gambling anytime soon.</p>
<p>In more recent news, Dubai delayed the approval of casino resorts in a potential setback for MGM Resorts and its regional ambitions. MGM Resorts is collaborating with Wasl Asset Management Group in hopes of creating a high-profile 150,000-square-foot venue. The former company has already invested quite a lot in the region and is bullish on being one of the casino pioneers in the UAE.</p>
