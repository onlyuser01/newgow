<p>Las Vegas-based gambling and sports betting technology provider Scientific Games has partnered with SidePlay Entertainment to become the exclusive e-instant lottery content distributor across North America. The company that has recently expanded into the fantasy sports content via a partnership with Fantasy Sports Interactive, is now expanding into the digital lottery space.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the signed deal, SG’s OpenGaming technology will be used to launch SidePlay’s engaging games, and the Pennsylvania Lottery will be the first to offer the online lottery products of the new partner of SG.</p>
<p>“In partnership with Scientific Games, our team has worked closely with the team at the Pennsylvania Lottery to refine game content for their players. We’re delighted to be helping the lottery broaden the variety of ilottery content available in the state and in turn, providing a significant contribution to programmes for older Pennsylvanians. We’re looking forward to a continued and successful partnership with both the Pennsylvania Lottery and Scientific Games.” Steve Hickson, Director, SidePlay Entertainment</p>
<p>SidePlay Entertainment is a developer of engaging instant lottery content, built on years of real player feedback, to guarantee memorable experience. The company has more than 190 instant win games launched for both lottery and gambling operators worldwide. SidePlay is also the primary gaming content provider to UK’s National Lottery.</p>
<p>New Additions to SG’s Instant Games</p>
<p>The deal with SidePlay will significantly improve Scientific Games’ e-instant games offered through the Open Gaming System (OGS) which is a core function of the OpenGaming ecosystem and has unique features that act as digital content aggregator, with all SG’s and third party’s games gathered in a market basket through a single interface.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to bring exciting new e-instant game entertainment to Pennsylvania Lottery players first through our newly-formed partnership with SidePlay Entertainment. These new games will be a great addition to our offering of ilottery content that can be enjoyed conveniently from players’ desktop or laptop computers, tablets and mobile devices.” Amy Bergette, VP lottery digital content studio, Scientific Games</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Lottery that currently offers more than 70 instant games delivered through SG’s OpenGaming, has its online and mobile gaming product entirely developed and powered by Scientific Games, and will be the first to launch the new games from SidePlay. The lottery in the Keystone State that had its sales exceed $1 billion in less than two years, is considered to be the most successful digital lottery program in North America.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania residents will first gain access to SidePlay’s new gaming title, Piggy Bank Payout, with many other games to follow as new and existing titles will be gradually added to the platform.</p>
