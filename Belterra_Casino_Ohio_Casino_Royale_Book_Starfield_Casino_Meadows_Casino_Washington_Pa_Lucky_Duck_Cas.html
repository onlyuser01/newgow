<p>Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium Nearly Doubled 2022 Tourism Forecast</p>
<p>Posted on: March 18, 2023, 11:59h.</p>

<p>Nearly half of the 1.7M fans who packed sporting and music events at Allegiant Stadium in 2022 were tourists, according to a new report in the Las Vegas Review-Journal. That is nearly double the number that was originally forecast.</p>
<p>The top-attended Allegiant Stadium event in 2022 was the Las Vegas Raiders vs. Los Angeles Chargers NFL game on January 1. It drew 58,871 fans. (Image: Facebook)</p>
<p>Stadium Authority chair Steve Hill — who also serves as president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority — told the newspaper that his organization had predicted that tourism would account for only 27% of an average Allegiant crowd. Instead, that number turned out to be between 40% and 49%.</p>
<p>About 65% of the approximately 500K fans who attended the last five Raider home games of last season (or 325K) came from out of town, according to the stadium authority, with a high of 69% (or 39.9K) coming for the December 18, 2022 matchup against the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>But the highest percentage of tourists was the whopping 87% (or 48,716 fans) in the stands for the October 8, 2022, one-off Shamrock Series football game between Notre Dame and BYU. According to the stadium authority, 81% of those fans traveled to Las Vegas specifically to attend that game.</p>
<p>In Your Face, Doubters!</p>
<p>This is great news for Las Vegas tourism, the kind that’s winning converts from those who opposed the original plan to build Allegiant.</p>
<p>Constructed between 2017 and 2020 to bring the NFL’s Raiders over from Oakland, the stadium cost $1.9B. That makes it the second-most expensive stadium ever built — after the Rams’ $5.5B SoFi Stadium in LA. The difference is that SoFi was 100% privately funded, while $750M of Allegiant’s price tag was footed by municipal bonds issued by Clark County.</p>
<p>Those bonds were backed by the proceeds of a 1.4% special tax on Las Vegas hotel rooms — a tax that also partially funded an expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>
<p>In 2016, two grassroots lobbying organizations fiercely opposed the public funding, noting that it came at a time when state budgets had been slashed by $300M to cover shortfalls.</p>
<p>In a statement made at the time, Nevadans for the Common Good said the stadium deal “involves substantial risk to the public without providing commensurate community benefits.” A statement from the Nevada Taxpayers Association noted “significant data indicating that subsidized stadiums can be a detriment to a community.”</p>
<p>Naysayer Changes Opinion</p>
<p>News of Allegiant’s unexpectedly high 2022 contribution to Las Vegas tourism was enough to get at least one former naysayer singing a new tune.</p>
<p>In 2016, Tick Segerblom, now a Clark County Commissioner, was one of only five state senators who voted against Allegiant’s public funding.</p>
<p>“The truth is, I think it’s beat everybody’s wildest expectations,” Segerblom told the R-J. “It filled a void, and now we can hold any event in the world. It really has been incredibly beneficial.”</p>
