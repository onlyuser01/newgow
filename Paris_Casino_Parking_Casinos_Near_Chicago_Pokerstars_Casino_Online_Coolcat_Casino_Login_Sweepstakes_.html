    <h1>Paris Casino Parking Casinos Near Chicago Pokerstars Casino Online Coolcat Casino Login Sweepstakes</h1>

<p>Greetings casinoguru.</p>
<p>Since the complaints team of Captain Spins has done nothing for my situation, i am writing to you.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago i made my first deposit of 150â‚¬ in this casino via Skrill and after selecting my payment method, i found out i can get a bonus.</p>
<p>I accepted that bonus and proceeded into playing.</p>
<p>After only a few spins i won around 500 euros. At this point i made contact with the live chat support to cancel that bonus but i got informed that despite the money getting added to my cash account i cannot cancel the bonus.</p>
<p>After playing for a while more i bumped into the bottom of the welcome page which stated that deposits via skrill are not available for first time bonus which got me suprised since i got offered the bonus after selecting skrill, so my guess was that the first page bonus was different than the one i got offered.</p>
<p>The live chat told me that she understands my concern but i was able to make a deposit via Skrill, that means the deposit method was made available to my region.</p>
<p>I kept playing then, finished my wager at around 1.5k and then played on higher stakes and ended up with a 4k withdrawal.</p>
<p>After waiting for a few days i got informed that my account has breached the term no10. (Skrill deposits not allowed for first bonus) and the no12. (Greek players not allowed to get bonuses)</p>
<p>I submitted a complaint stating that i am playing in white hat casinos for a long time and never again have i experienced this. I asked them to send me the 3850 which is the amount without the 150 bonus money, since it's not my fault that they offer bonuses to people from countries that are not allowed to get bonuses and I DIDN'T USE THE BONUS MONEY AT ANY POINT.</p>
<p>They offered me 200 cash which i find unacceptable.</p>
<p>In my opinion, considering the level of knowledge a designer and programmer needs to get into the online casino industry, this is just an attempt from them to create a lose lose situation for the player, therefore it's a scam on a casino regulated by the MGA and UK gambling commision.</p>
<p>I see that you have solved issues with greek players getting their withdrawals voided and i seek your help.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
