    <h1>Casino In Cancun Casino Promotions Boomtown Casino Nevada 7Bit Casino Review Hardrock Casino SYNOT G</h1>

<p>The new collaboration is meant to help both partners pursue their strategic goals</p>
<p>Developer of casino slots and table games SYNOT Games announced its online casino content would soon become available to players in Lithuania via a new partnership with CBet.</p>
<p>‘The Best Gaming Experiences Possible’</p>
<p>The new casino content deal with CBet will allow SYNOT Games to deliver some of its most popular titles, enhance the regulated product offering at the online casino operator and help it affirm its presence in the Lithuanian gaming market.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new arrangement, Karolis Gogaitis, general manager at CBet, outlined that the new partnership was part of the operator’s efforts “to bring the best gaming experiences possible” to its players in Lithuania, and looking forward ” to working with SYNOT Games” to achieve that.</p>
<p>“Cbet has a lot of content that ramps up the excitement and eliminates any chance of boredom for players,” Gogaitis added.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, SYNOT Games will deliver some of its most exciting games such as Respin Joker, 81 Fruit Awards, Firebird Double 27, and others from its expansive portfolio of more than 100 slot titles to further expand game availability for CBet online casino players.</p>
<p>‘Another Crucial Step’</p>
<p>On behalf of SYNOT Games, Martina Hrabinska, chief commercial officer at the games developer company, commented on the new partnership, outlining CBet’s credentials as an operator and a partner.</p>
<p>“CBet is a feature-full gaming platform that covers a lot of ground,” Hrabinska said, convinced that the collaboration agreed with the casino operator represented “another crucial step” for SYNOT Games and its efforts to increase its presence in the Lithuanian market.</p>
<p>“We are convinced that this partnership will prove to be beneficial for both parties,” she boldly stated.</p>
<p>As an established provider of casino content, SYNOT Games delivers its gaming titles under licenses issued by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and the UK Gambling Commission, while its content is already certified across several major European gaming markets, including Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Sweden.</p>
<p>Expanding European Presence</p>
<p>The content deal agreed with CBet is the latest for the content developer with an online casino operator with a presence in a major European gaming jurisdiction, following just months after two major partnerships with operators in the Netherlands and Italy.</p>
<p>In October, SYNOT Games teamed with Italian operator Planetwin365 to provide the subsidiary of SKS365 Group with a suite of online casino games among which popular titles Book of Secrets 6, Skull Bonanza and 27 Joker Fruits.</p>
<p>Later in the same month, SYNOT Games joined forces with Play North to launch gaming content in three European markets: the Netherlands, via the Kansino brand; Malta, via the Piikakasino brand, and Estonia, via the Kiirkasiino brand.</p>
