<p>The new partnership will provide customers with the ability to enjoy and bet on MLB games through the FanDuel+ OTT platform, as well as through the sportsbook app. As part of the deal, FanDuel will get national broadcast integrations.</p>
<p>FanDuel Preparing for National Broadcast</p>
<p>As an exclusive sports betting partner to the MLB, FanDuel will also be receiving expanded marketing rights, enabling it to use the official MLB branding. Furthermore, FanDuel will be able to use highlights in its FanDuel TV programming, as well as in various products. A big focus of the partnership will be enhancing the matchday betting experience for the fans.</p>
<p>FanDuel will utilize both the FanDuel+ OTT platform as well as the sportsbook app to stream MLB.TV’s Free Game of the Day, signaling the company’s commitment to innovate in the space. Christian Genetski, president of FanDuel Group expressed the company’s excitement to work with MLB and praised the fans of the sport.</p>
<p>“The baseball fan is one of the most engaged in all of the sports, which is why we’re delighted to be the new sports betting partner of Major League Baseball,” he said. Genetski added that FanDuel is eager for its nationwide exposure through the MLB partnership, and promised product innovations and an enhanced customer experience on every pitch.</p>
<p>MLB, on its part, highly praised FanDuel. “As one of the top sportsbooks in America, FanDuel has been an industry leader in innovative fan engagement opportunities while also reminding them of the importance of doing it responsibly.” said Kenny Gersh – executive vice president, Media and Business Development at MLB.</p>
<p>Responsible Gambling Increasingly Important</p>
<p>MLB has been very openly supportive of responsible gambling. Its growing commitment also showed last year, when MLB partnered with the American Gaming Association (AGA) in the latter’s responsible gambling campaign back in September 2022. This ties in with the League’s Platinum Member status in the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG)’s Leadership Circle.</p>
<p>MLB’s commitment to responsible gambling, coupled with its extensive reach, adds layers to choosing FanDuel as an official sports betting partner, and can only improve the company’s perception. FanDuel itself has also shown its own commitment to a more sustainable industry over the years. FanDuel and Gaming Society partnered last October to empower women in betting.</p>
<p>Responsible gambling has been a topic of growing importance in the industry, especially amid recent growth and sweeping changes. AmericanGambling launched a new platform recently, aimed at providing players of all experience levels with accurate and up-to-date information about gambling in the US – from gambling laws and payment systems to reviews of licensed platforms.</p>
