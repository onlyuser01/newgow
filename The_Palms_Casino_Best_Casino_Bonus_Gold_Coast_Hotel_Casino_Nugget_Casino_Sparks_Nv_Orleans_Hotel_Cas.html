<p>FunFair Games has cultivated an impressive portfolio of titles, including Astroboomers to the Moon!, The Wheel of Steal, Dig It, Hugo: Up and Away, and Five Ball Fiesta, among many others. The company has been working to actively push the envelope of the iGaming industry and the way games are developed.</p>
<p>Jumpman is also confident that the addition of these titles is an important step forward for the network and each individual brand the company works on. The games will give audiences a brand-new way to experience iGaming and benefit from the enticing gameplay as well as the added variation and even winning potential.</p>
<p>As to FunFair Games, the company is dedicated to developing products that it sees as the future of iGaming and the coming generations of gamblers.

<p>Commenting on this partnership, FunFair Games commercial director Carlo Cooke welcomed the opportunity to be working with Jumpman Gaming and praised the company’s network that allows FunFair to get its games in front of as many eyes as possible:</p>
