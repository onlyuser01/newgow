<p>Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak has announced possible measures against the spread of Covid-19, as the number of positive cases increases in the state.</p>
<p>Mitigation Options Considered By Nevada Authorities</p>
<p>Nevada currently faces a surge in Covid-19 cases, which prompted Governor Steve Sisolak to announce his administation is considering “all mitigation options” against the spread of the virus. However, he did not comment on a potential second lockdown for businesses.</p>
<p>The State authorities are “walking a tightrope to balance public health and economic impacts,” he added and will wait for next week’s infection rates before taking any decision.</p>
<p>Governor Sisolak also promised he will inform Nevadans on the potential next measures against the virus in a future announcement.</p>
<p>Nevadans should expect to hear from me on our status and next steps in the near future. I am aware of how consequential these decisions are &amp; I continue to work with state health officials, emergency management &amp; economic leaders to determine the best approach. — Governor Sisolak (@GovSisolak) November 18, 2020</p>
<p>March Shutdown Led To $1 Billion Loss in Business Revenue</p>
<p>Nonessential businesses, which include gaming venues, were ordered by the Governor to close down temporarily in March, in order to minimize the impact of the pandemic. The state reported a $1 billion loss in its budget, which resulted in multiple layoffs statewide.</p>
<p>On November 10, Governor Sisolak asked citizens to stay at home, for two weeks if possible, in an attempt to mitigate the number of coronavirus cases and to avoid stricter restrictions.</p>
<p>Those efforts failed to improve the situation, as Nevada recorded a daily average of 1,288 cases in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>“To be blunt, our state is surging and continues to surge”, Governor Steve Sisolak said.</p>
<p>Nearly 15.6% of people tested were positive. The state said there were about 125,000 cases and 1,947 deaths linked to Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Governor Sisolak tested positive for the virus on Friday and is at the moment in self-isolation in Carson City. He said he did not need oxygen or medication.</p>
<p>Casinos Ordered To Shut Down in Multiple States</p>
<p>Multiple states recently announced tightened measures against the spread of Covid-19, which includes the shutdown of all indoor entertainment venues in Michigan, and Illinois, while New York reduced the operating hours of casinos and other businesses, and Indiana implemented social distancing and face-covering protocols.</p>
<p>“It is hard to imagine a world in which we don’t see more restrictive operating environments for US retail casinos across the next two quarters. The only questions are how restrictive measures will be, and what specific form those measures will take.” Chris Grove, a financial analyst with Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming</p>
