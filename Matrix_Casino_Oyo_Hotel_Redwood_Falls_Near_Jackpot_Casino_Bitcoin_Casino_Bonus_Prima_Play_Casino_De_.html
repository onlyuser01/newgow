<p>The global gaming and entertainment company, MGM Resorts International, announced Monday it will be the presenting sponsor of the annual Las Vegas Pride Parade. Returning as the presenting sponsor, the collaboration marks the company's support for the 17th consecutive year. As a result, MGM Resorts will be the presenting sponsor for the event planned to take place in downtown Las Vegas on Friday, October 6, 2023, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Currently, the company is renowned as one of the long-time sponsors of the annual Pride Parade. MGM Resorts first supported the event back in 2003 and continues to show support for the LGBTQ+ community every year. Similar to previous years when MGM Resorts was a presenting sponsor of the event, its employees will also join in the celebration and marching.</p>
<p>Additionally, MGM Resorts was among the first supporters of the LGBTQ+ community within the hospitality and gaming sector. As one of the first organizations that showed support, in 2004, the company offered same-sex health benefits to its employees.</p>
<p>What's more, MGM Resorts offers same-sex ceremonies at its chapels, further underlining its commitment to equality. LGBTQ+ employees of the company can benefit from accessing free resources to help find quality healthcare. Moreover, MGM Resorts has been a vocal advocate for the human rights of LGBTQ+ communities.</p>
<p>The efforts by the company are recognized by the Human Rights Campaign. Consequently, MGM Resorts was recognized as one of the "Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality" and has secured a perfect score for more than a decade within the Corporate Equality Index, a survey that evaluates corporate practices and policies related to LGBTQ+ equality in the workplace.</p>
<p>Jyoti Chopra, MGM Resorts' Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer, commented on the topic: "We are proud to reaffirm our support for the LGBTQ+ community and celebrate love in all its forms." Finally, Chopra pointed out: "Our participation is an extension of our ongoing efforts to foster a more inclusive and equitable world."</p>
<p>The sponsorship for the Las Vegas Pride Parade was announced after recently, MGM Resorts and BetMGM announced the launch of a new responsible gaming campaign. The campaign involved nine different NFL stadiums and sought to promote the popular responsible gaming program, GameSense. The aforementioned program debunks different misconceptions and will provide vital information throughout the football season. BetMGM and MGM Resorts became the first gaming operators to engage in the promotion of responsible gaming via NFL stadiums.</p>
