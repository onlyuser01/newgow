    <h1>Yakama Legends Casino Davenport Iowa Casino Harrah S Pennsylvania Casinos Ohio Casino Control Commis</h1>

<p>I have used this casino a number of times, making deposits and withdrawals roughly 10 times.</p>
<p>Currently, I have two pending withdrawal requests which aren't being processed:</p>
<p>① Approximately $45 (I am unable to login to confirm the exact amount)</p>
<p>② Approximately $27 (This is the amount left after deducting a fee since I was unable to wager due to a block, as per the instructions in the email below)</p>
<p>Despite my attempts to contact customer service, my account has been blocked and I am unable to login.</p>
<p>Currently, I have withdrawal requests pending for ① and ②.</p>
<p>08d8269b-fb67-42a0-a331-cbf301c81335</p>
<p>4ef8929b-8ea6-4a01-a2e5-e772be9fa833</p>
<p>Moreover, I have been sending emails since September 9th and have not received any response.</p>
<p>The latest email I received from the casino is pasted below:</p>
<p>Email: "In accordance with Sections 13.5 and 13.5.1 of the General Terms of Use, we regret to inform you that once you have withdrawn the remaining funds from your account, it will be blocked. Unfortunately, you cannot use the current balance. Please note that you can only withdraw the funds."</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>After taking out withdrawal ①,</p>
<p>My ability to place bets was blocked about a week ago.</p>
<p>At that point, I had already deposited an amount for ②, and following the instructions in the above email, I was left with no choice but to request withdrawal for ② as well.</p>
<p>It's been a few days since the money didn't come in, so I attempted to login to make an inquiry. However, my login has been denied. (Blocked from Sept 9)</p>
<p>To add to this, even though I have been sending emails daily since the 9th, I have received no response.</p>
<p>I would like to get the withdrawals from ① and ② processed.</p>
<p>Please note that I can't log into the site at the moment, so the values may slightly vary.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
