For reference, the total number of retail slots in the states decreased from 25,823 in June 2022 to 25,348 in June 2023.</p>
<p>Retail table games in Pennsylvania had mostly stable revenue at $76.2 million, marking a slight 0.11% increase. Online table games, meanwhile, rose in popularity, earning $34.8 million, 24% up on June 2022.</p>
<p>Sports betting exploded in popularity, raking in revenue of $23 million. This translates into an increase of 80.6%.</p>
