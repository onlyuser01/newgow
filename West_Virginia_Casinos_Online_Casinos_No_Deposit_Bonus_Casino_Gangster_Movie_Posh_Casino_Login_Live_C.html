    <h1>West Virginia Casinos Online Casinos No Deposit Bonus Casino Gangster Movie Posh Casino Login Live C</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>The case is a bit older, but I still haven't received my money in my casino account.</p>
<p>At that time I paid in via Neosurf voucher (2x 25 euros) and the amount was never credited to my account. Even after passing on the voucher code, they want to tell me I deposited the money at another casino.</p>
<p>That is even partly true. If you buy a 50 euro credit card, you can deposit 25 euros at one casino and 25 euros at another casino.</p>
<p>When depositing the 2nd amount, I immediately took a screenshot of the code and the deposit and still they wanted to tell me I deposited at another casino.</p>
<p>The money has definitely arrived at the casino because when I deposit via Neosurf it is an instant transaction and the credit is gone from the card. My account still says pending.</p>
<p>I just find it tacky that someone tries to consciously deceive me in order to solve this.</p>
