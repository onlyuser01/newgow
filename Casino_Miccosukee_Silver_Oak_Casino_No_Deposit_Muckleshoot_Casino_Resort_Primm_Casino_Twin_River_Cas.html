<p>A mayor of a municipality in the state of Victoria, Australia, has implemented a ban on gambling ads at local sports events and now faces opposition</p>
<p>The Guardian reported that the mayor of the City of Monash, Tina Samardzija, is also advocating for other councils to take similar actions and implement a ban on all forms of gambling advertisements at community sports events, instead of waiting for government legislation to be passed.</p>
<p>Children Should Be Protected from the Normalization of Gambling</p>
<p>As per the policy, sports clubs that continue to display logos of sponsors that operate gambling machines will eventually be prohibited from using council grounds and clubhouses. Currently, these logos are displayed on some jerseys, websites, newsletters, and billboards around council grounds.</p>
<p>Mayor Samardzija holds the belief that local governments should play a bigger role in preventing problem gambling and gambling addiction and dismissed claims that councils should not be involved in such policies.</p>
<p>She highlighted that the local community is very concerned about how youngsters that play sports or are sports fans are facing exposure to gambling. According to the Monash mayor, the primary worry of the local government should be the well-being of children, and involvement in social policies is imperative to ensure that. Samardzija further added that kids playing sports should not be bombarded with messages normalizing gambling.</p>
<p>According to Samardzija, gaming establishments should continue to invest in community sports but not anticipate any recognition for it. She believes that this is their responsibility due to the negative impact they have on the people in the area, and not something that should be rewarded with sponsorship.</p>
<p>Local Sports Clubs and Gambling Companies Resist Mayor Samardzija’s Policy</p>
<p>The policy, which is thought to be a pioneering initiative in Australia, has met with resistance from sports clubs and gaming establishments in the area. Local sports clubs have expressed concern that the policy could lead to their closure, while gaming venues feel that they are being unjustly targeted.</p>
<p>For example, Mulgrave Country Club, a notable gambling establishment in the region, which generated AUD 7.1 million ($4.9 million) in gaming revenue during the last fiscal year, supports a large number of local sports teams and leagues.</p>
<p>The club’s president, Peter Delaney, highlighted that they are a non-profit organization and donate their funds solely to community groups and sports clubs. In connection with the new policy, Delaney mentioned that there have been inquiries from various sports teams and leagues worried about the potential loss of funding from the club.</p>
<p>Andrew Lloyd, head of Community Clubs Victoria, expressed skepticism about the council’s involvement in shaping social policy. The organization, which represents gaming venues, is in the process of acquiring legal counsel to contest the policy, as they are concerned that other councils may follow suit.</p>
