<p>SoftSwiss, a leading iGaming supplier, has established a new partnership with Barbara Bang, a provider and developer of online casino solutions. Thanks to this collaboration, SoftSwiss has been able to significantly expand its presence in the Latin American market. Barbara Bang is a fairly new developer, too, established only in 2021.</p>
<p>Barbara Bang Becomes Latest Developer in SoftSwiss Family</p>
<p>The company focuses on operations in Latin America, but also Europe, and elsewhere. This new partnership will see the company’s product added to the SoftSwiss Game Aggregator’s portfolio. A total of 30 games will be injected into the aggregation tool and distributed throughout SoftSwiss’ own network of trusted and reliable operators.</p>
<p>SoftSwiss supports more than 100 currencies and is tailored to serve various jurisdictions around the world, owing to its multi-lingual proposition. The platform itself will provide the developer with a number of excellent benefits that can be tailored and adjusted directly to impact Barbara Bang’s games.</p>
<p>The developer will benefit from buy-in bonuses, jackpots, a flexible back office and detailed stats of how its games perform, along with engagement and retention tools such as free spins and tournaments. Commenting on this opportunity, SoftSwiss Partner Managers Team Lead Nikita Keino said:</p>
<p>We are delighted that Barbara Bang is becoming a SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator partner. This cooperation will expand the game content options available to our clients. SoftSwiss Partner Managers Team Lead Nikita Keino</p>
<p>Keino added that SoftSwiss is doing its best to make sure that it continues to offer top-notch solutions for its partners, whether they are the providers of games or the operators who are interested in exploring those new business opportunities in the first place. Breaking ground is challenging, Keino admitted, but SoftSwiss is definitely pivoting well towards new markets and opportunities.</p>
<p>SoftSwiss Performs Well Across the Board</p>
<p>Previously, SoftSwiss reported that its Afflika solution has seen a 20% increase in player acquisitions on a monthly basis, pointing to the strength of the solution, but also the appeal of the company’s platform. SoftSwiss has been laser-focused to generate further results for its partner companies and make sure that players from all backgrounds have access to some of the most accomplished titles in iGaming.</p>
<p>The aggregator company is also well-versed in cryptocurrencies, offering support to companies that are interested in significantly increasing their presence in this segment and seeking to achieve new opportunities.</p>
