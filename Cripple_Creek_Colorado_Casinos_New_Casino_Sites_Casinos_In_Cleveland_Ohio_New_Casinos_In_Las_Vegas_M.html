    <h1>Cripple Creek Colorado Casinos New Casino Sites Casinos In Cleveland Ohio New Casinos In Las Vegas M</h1>

<p>The casino sent me an email offering a promotion "Nick200" which offers the user 200 additional free spins at the time of registration on top of the standard bonus.</p>
<p>I entered the promo code, and deposited, and noticed that I just received the standard sign up package. Luckily, i took a screenshot of the offer so I planned to quickly have the issue resolved by customer service.</p>
<p>I have now contacted support two seperate times. They have looked at the screenshot of my deposit. It shows the promo code entered, it shows the promo code being valid, and it shows the promo code being applied and what the deposit will receive. Both of these support staff people have looked at this, and then told me that I didnt enter the code, therefore, they are unwilling to add the spins to my account.</p>
<p>Its a total joke. They looking at a blue sky and telling me the sky isnt blue. They are looking at a screenshot showing I entered the promo code, and telling me I didnt enter a promo code.</p>
<p>And the fact that they are willing to lose the business over something like this is ridiculous. I contacted them before placing any wagers, and they were still unwilling to make any attempts to help me. Instead they told me that nothing could be done, followed by a condescending high five emoji.</p>
<p>I feel i am obiously entitled to the offer as it was described originally.</p>
