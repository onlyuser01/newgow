<p>Massachusetts is the latest state to confirm and set the date for the launch of its sports betting industry, the Boston Globe has confirmed, citing the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC).</p>
<p>The state will go live on January 31 at 10 am local time and introduce residents and visitors of the Bay State to a number of retail sports betting options, hosted by Encore Boston Harbor, Plainridge Park Casino, and MGM Springfield, all of which have cleared the commission’s requirements to obtain a license and introduce a legal betting market.</p>
<p>This is happening ahead of Super Bowl LVII which is taking place on Sunday, February 12, which is one of the biggest-scoring betting events in the United States, according to the American Gaming Association.</p>
<p>Previously, commissioners proposed January 30 as a potential launch date, but the final details were hammered on Friday, with MGC Director Karen Wells happy to see sports betting introduced at 10 am specifically. The state’s casinos have already teamed up with third-party operators, who will bring their betting expertise on-site.</p>
<p>Boston Harbor is partnering with both Caesars Sportsbook and WynnBet, Plainridge Park Casino is maintaining a partnership with Penn Sports Interactive and its Barstool Sportsbook, and BetFanatics, and not least, there is MGM Springfield that will forge ahead with its proprietary BetMGM Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks will bring an entire variety of betting options, including moneylines, spreads, and totals, but also player props and parlays, which will allow locals and visitors to enjoy a fulsome betting experience. The betting calendar is also packed with many worthwhile events.</p>
<p>Bay State bettors will first have the opportunity to wager on the upcoming Super Bowl on February 12, but also follow that up with March Madness in March. While the sports betting calendar will be in a bit of a lull after that, there will be sufficient sports events to wager on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Massachusetts is also planning to push ahead with the launch of mobile and online betting in the state. This launch is still a moving target, and it may happen at some point in February or early March. Hope is that the mobile rollout will precede the arrival of the big collegiate basketball tournament in March.</p>
<p>In terms of who will be able to go live for mobile betting, there are more than ten operators already approved, including Betway, Barstool, BetFanatics, Betr, Bally Bet, PointsBet, Caesars, BetMGM, DraftKings, FanDuel, WynnBet.</p>
