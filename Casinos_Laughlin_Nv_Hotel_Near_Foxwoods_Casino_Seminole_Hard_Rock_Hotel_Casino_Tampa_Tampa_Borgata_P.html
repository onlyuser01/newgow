<p>As colleagues who interact most with our clientele, dealers are the face of the establishment. They must possess qualities such as adaptability, dexterity, perfectionism, and knowledge. Dealing is an artform, and we want to ensure Melco’s dealers master the art through a paid three-month training program – learning from the best in the industry. Melco Cyprus</p>
<p>The course is going to start on December 5 and will help candidates get themselves acquainted and then well-versed in the highest industry standards as table games professionals. Another session is already scheduled for January 9, 2023, with Melco planning to train as many professionals as it can, as the company is in high demand for live dealers.</p>
<p>Melco Is Committed to Bringing Fresh Employment Opportunities</p>
<p>There are several games that dealers will have to learn, as well as table etiquette that goes hand-in-hand with that. Those who enrol will find out more about poker, baccarat, blackjack, Texas Hold’em, roulette, and others. Commenting on this new opportunity, Melco said that the school was in line with its global ambition to bring economic benefits as well as employment opportunities to every market the company touches.</p>
