<p>Dear Maureen,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.888true.com/terms/:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Comp points are accrued while playing certain games at the Casino.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may not accrue Comp Points while using a no deposit bonus or playing games using previously redeemed Comp Points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100 Comp Points have a value of $1.00</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum number of comp points that you may redeem is 1000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be eligible to redeem your comp points, your account balance must be $0, and you must have no pending withdrawals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for listed restricted games, the wagering requirement on all Comp Points is as follows: 30 times playthrough requirement for Slots, Keno, Bonus Bingo and Scratch Cards; and 60 times playthrough requirement for Table Games and Video Poker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comp Points cannot be used in Roulette, Craps, Baccarat, Pai Gow Poker, Pontoon 21, War, Sic Bo, and/or 'Shooting games' -e.g. Fish Catch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comp Points come with 1-time maximum withdrawal limit."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, there is not much I can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else, I could do for you in this matter. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
