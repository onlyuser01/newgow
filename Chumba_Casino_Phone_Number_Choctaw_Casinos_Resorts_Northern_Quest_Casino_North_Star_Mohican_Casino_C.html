    <h1>Chumba Casino Phone Number Choctaw Casinos Resorts Northern Quest Casino North Star Mohican Casino C</h1>

<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter. You pose the question as to whether or not anybody from my household Has an account at the casino. I live alone and have no regular boyfriend.I do however have friends and I know my neighbors so I mean there's people that come over but Surely you can't be suggesting that I screen every single person I meet to get the details of their accounts and subscriptions in their phones. That's just ludicrous . I mean I don't really know what to say. I was pretty confused myself when they told me that. I'm not going to waste anybody's time by trying to advocate for myself. This whole thing is actually upsetting me because I just feel swindled. But yes I passed the KYC verification Even though they made me send my documents and I believe 4 times Claiming that myself eholding the ID was blurry or something like that but that's whatever that's fine with me I sent it in it's all verified address IDI even had to make a deposit and I mean before I deposited I had a guy on customer service for literally about half an hour drilling him with question after question because I have heard of scam casino sites before But but I became satisfied After we went over pretty much every single aspect of my account as well as the bonus Terms &amp; Conditions and I screenshot it every single bit of it. Whoever their customer service person was that I chatted with that day had all the devices and tools he needed to check everything out and he did and he assured me that there was no reason whatsoever they could deny me . Met all the wager requirements as well as stayed within the be limit. 8 and went over other areas of it and advise me that I only have one account and I've only claimed 1 bonus and I mean yeah I don't know what else to say except I've only got 1 account and they know it. I asked for any sort of Proof</p>
<p>whatsoever because I knew they were Bsing me And that's basically when they finished Up the chat Obviously .Now as mad as they make me I have to be honest And say that the small deposit of 10 or $15 in Bitcoin was Returnedto me so I can't say that they robbed me of anything tangible but they sure Rob me of several hours of my life. You know probably the two or three hours it took to satisfy the wage of requirements and then the countless numbers of documents I had to send in over maybe a 10-day period so I guess yeah they did Rob me because at the end of the day time is our most valued commodity. At some point and everybody's life they're going to go all in and lose and their chips are just going to stay on the table and somebody else is going to play with them so those chips don't really matter the only thing that matters is the way you choose to spend the precious time it's given to you and they are definitely not empathetic or sensitive to anybody's time</p>
