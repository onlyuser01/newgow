<p>Bayes Esports is making a major move in the United States with the company registering to be recognized as a licensed sports betting supplier in New Jersey and Colorado. The license will enable Bayes Esports, to provide live esports data directly from the game publisher, the press release, shared with Casino Guru News ahead of publication, explained.</p>
<p>This will enable the company to support a next generation of online betting experiences by providing the necessary data to partners who are actively seeking to break ground into this vertical. Bayes Esports is fully committed to ensuring the integrity of sports betting and introducing a new standard for integrity.</p>
<p>The company wants to do what it describes as, "open the door for esports betting in the United States." Esports betting first became popular in the United States during the pandemic in 2020 when individual states decided to authorize wagering on competitive video gaming events.</p>
<p>Both New Jersey and Nevada did but insisted that they are petitioned for each event before an operator could offer markets on a given event. Since the return of sports, the focus has shifted back to mainstream sports wagering, but not entirely, as esports is continuing to gather momentum. Bayes Esports is determined to ensure that live online betting and esports betting can be offered legally and responsibly. Bayes Esports Managing Director and COO Amir Mirzaee:</p>
<p>The betting market in the US is changing and while it is still lagging behind its European counterpart, it without a doubt will be one of the biggest and most relevant markets in the near future. Out of all the states, New Jersey and Colorado happened to be the most progressive and open to innovation, but we expect others to follow suit very shortly.</p>
<p>Bayes Esports appreciates bet365, a long-standing partner operator that has already embraced the esports betting segment in places like Europe. North America is slowly warming up to the idea of esports betting.</p>
<p>Entain is rumored to be working on a new project with Unikrn and Pinnacle, one of the first operators to fully embrace esports betting, is launching in Ontario, Canada before long. To top it all off, Rivalry, an innovative esports betting platform in Canada is scaling its clout in the regulated gambling markets across sports, esports, and casino.</p>
<p>Bayes Esports is very confident that it can help expand the reach of esports betting in 9 states and live online betting in 31 states, and is helping shape the legislation by working actively with the relevant governing bodies and legislative powers that will allow the vertical to launch in more places.</p>
