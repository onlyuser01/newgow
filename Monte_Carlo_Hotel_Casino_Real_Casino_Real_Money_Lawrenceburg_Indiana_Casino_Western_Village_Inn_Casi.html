    <h1>Monte Carlo Hotel Casino Real Casino Real Money Lawrenceburg Indiana Casino Western Village Inn Casi</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>We would love to respond to the following quote of yours:</p>
<p>"If the player has opened a second account to claim, for example, a welcome bonus for a second time, then this is an intentional circumvention of the rules. However, there are many situations where players may have opened a second account accidentally"</p>
<p>We're attaching a screenshot of the alternative account history that showcases the fact that it was intentionally created to claim a certain welcome bonus for the chance of hitting the big win. Depending on the amount, the OP would decide which account, he would make the withdrawal request from. However, as soon as she realized that the bonus required a deposit to claim the reward, there was only one way left for her to continue, which was the free bonuses. On top of it, the second account was created purposely not incidentally, as it had been fully verified with the email and mobile phone. No entity or person can persuade us to believe that the following actions can be executed without the user's intent.</p>
<p>As for the KYC procedure failure, let's recap some of the facts according to the proofs we provided. Hopefully, it helps Casino Guru's team see the truth rather than supporting the OP that has used just the words to support her evidence rather than utilizing the data/proofs for it.</p>
<p>As per the screenshots we provided:</p>
<p>rityraj = Man (Main)</p>
<p>rimaraj = Woman (Alternative)</p>
<p>On the first try, OP sent the male's ID to complete the KYC procedure, while the selfie the user sent, in the end, was female's. The correlation between the user being female in real life and an alternative account linked to the same device ID as the main which was registered as Man is another pattern of us dealing with one person trying to bypass the 'Know your Customer' procedure.</p>
<p>To sum it up, the OP violated two terms of FortuneJack's privacy policy. The first is the multi-account and the second is one failure of the KYC procedure. Due to the violations, we terminated accounts and confiscated the wins. Note to say no deposits have been confiscated, but the wins coming from the bonus abusive actions (creating multiple accounts to increase the chance of winning a higher amount).</p>
<p>The decision on our end is final and will not be changed no matter what as multiple official entities already denied the OP request.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate to see the third-party website, Casino Guru supporting the user who committed the fraud and on the other end asking us, a licensed company to provide the user's personal information for the sake of closing the complaint. We will never accept it anyway as all the user's data are protected and will not be shared with a third party.</p>
<p>We're planning to overview this complaint on the market's leading crypto forum and invite all the reputable members of this niche to state their opinion rather than discussing it over here where the decisions are made without considering all the proof and blindly trusting the user which has not provided anything to the complaint. We think it is the right way for us to continue and most probably will never make an official announcement about the current or the upcoming complaints if the current method of approach does not change. It as well might lead us to terminate any connection to the entity and request the removal of the FortuneJack company listing as false information is spread around the company which negatively influences the company's presence.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention.</p>
<p>If there's anything you would love to discuss with us, kindly ask you to send it via email at t.kipiani@fortunejack.com</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
