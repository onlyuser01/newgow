    <h1>777 Casino Drive Cherokee Nc 28719 Playcroco Casino Wow Vegas Casino Login Best Real Money Casinos O</h1>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>Allow me to present the facts in a more professional manner to elucidate the grave discrepancy in this case. Bitstarz claims that they closed my account due to statements I made, asserting that I was financially distressed and that my family urgently needed funds. However, this portrayal does not paint an accurate picture of the situation.</p>
<p>The genesis of this issue traces back to April 15, 2023, a day when I was experiencing frustration with the drawn-out withdrawal process. Please understand that in my line of work as a journeyman lineman, I face challenges that require the utmost focus, and my profession entails unparalleled levels of difficulty and danger. My patience is a virtue I have cultivated over the years. Hence, when faced with the inexplicable delay in a withdrawal process, I opted not to vent my frustration but to expedite it with an admittedly white lie.</p>
<p>This white lie was in no way related to my actual financial state but was an effort to encourage Bitstarz to act promptly. However, I want to underscore that the critical point here is the date of this statement, which is April 15, 2023. It is essential to note that my account was not closed at this time. My account was actively utilized, specifically under the username ‘DarkMe88,’ until the end of July.</p>
<p>It was only in July that I contacted Bitstarz support to report the loss of my phone and the potential security threat it posed to my account. Consequently, I requested the deletion of my account for the sake of both the casino’s security and my gaming account. This was not an action taken due to irresponsible gaming but rather a responsible precaution.</p>
<p>Bitstarz, however, has mistakenly insisted that my account was permanently closed because of the comments made in April, and they claimed this happened on the very day the account was activated, which is patently untrue.</p>
<p>The accusation of multiple accounts is equally erroneous. When I transitioned from ‘ClintGaige@gmail.com’ to ‘DarkMe88,’ I did so with the full knowledge and assistance of Bitstarz support. This transition was initiated to maintain the security of my account. At no point did I attempt to deceive the casino or gain any undue advantage.</p>
<p>I have meticulously preserved evidence of these interactions and support’s role in guiding me in accordance with the terms and conditions. They never cautioned me or informed me that this transition would be viewed as a violation.</p>
<p>In July, as with ‘ClintGaige@gmail.com,’ I approached support with my concerns regarding the lost phone and email access under ‘DarkMe88.’ Once again, my objective was to protect the casino and my account. I did not gain from this action; in fact, I suffered a loss in status levels.</p>
<p>The allegation of multiple accounts is unfounded, and I can conclusively demonstrate that I had support assistance with each account deletion, all to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. I reiterate that I did not profit from this process; I have indeed suffered losses.</p>
<p>In light of these irrefutable facts and the substantial evidence I have provided, I firmly maintain that Bitstarz should honor its commitment to pay the winnings I am rightfully owed. I have undergone a lengthy and challenging ordeal to uphold my integrity, and it is time for Bitstarz to do the same and fulfill their obligation.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
