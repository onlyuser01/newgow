    <h1>Green Valley Casino In Henderson Yabby Casino Log In Lemoore Casino Rivers Casino Philly Casino Roya</h1>

<p>The minute I made a deposit my account closed. Because I made a mistake with my email I was not able to change emails so I could respond from the email that I used.</p>
<p>I was told to send a picture of my ID to them then they would unlock my account. So I did. Now they are making me jump through 10 more hoops when I've already wasted my whole day trying to get back onto my account. I asked for ny other accounts to be closed and simply change my email to the right one.</p>
<p>I have been playing on Canplay for 2 years. The very first time I made a deposit of $50, my money was seized and I was lied to. DO NOT GIVE THIS CASINO ANY MONEY. THEY ARE LIED AND STOLE MY MONEY. BIG SCAM.</p>
<p>They won't send me back my money and they are not unlocking my account like they promised. I have never been treated like this when I play on Royal Vegas or Grand Mondial Casino. Casino Rewards are the best online casino and their bonus is awesome. Deposit $10 after you sign up and you get 150 free spins. I have won thousands if dollars playing on these casino, cashing out at $60000 a month ago! I had no problem getting my money, and they did not lock my account because I made more than one account. They simply closed all my accounts and kept the one account I was playing on open. My choice.</p>
<p>They paid me every single dime that I won. CANPLAY FROZE MY ACCOUNT AFTER I MADE A DEPOSIT. DO NOT PLAY ON THIS CASINO, THEY RIPPED ME OFF. THEY LIE AND STEAL FROM LITTLE GIRLS. MY LAWYER IS FILING MY DISPUTE AND I AM CHARGING THEM FOR FRAUD. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, TRUST ME. I ASKED FOR MY MONEY BACK BECAUSE I NEVER PLAYED MY FUNDS AND THEY ARE KEEPING MY MONEY AND THEY WONT UNLOCK MY ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>THIS WAS THE WORST DECISION IVE EVER MADE IN MY LIFE. THIS CASINO IS OUT TO STEAL YOUR MONEY AND NEVER PAY IUT THE PLAYERS.</p>
<p>MISS PRESLEY</p>
