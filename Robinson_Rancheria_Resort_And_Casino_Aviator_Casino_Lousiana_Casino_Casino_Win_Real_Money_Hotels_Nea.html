    <h1>Robinson Rancheria Resort And Casino Aviator Casino Lousiana Casino Casino Win Real Money Hotels Nea</h1>

<p>Please help me deal with this awful casino I have been too patient with them.</p>
<p>For over 5 weeks now they have been delaying my payment.</p>
<p>Every time I ask support why they give some nonsense reason that I will provide some of below, then they wait 3-4 days and then reject it again.</p>
<p>I have been very patient but I am sure that at this point they are just trying to get me to lose the money in frustration.</p>
<p>One of the excuses was "You need to withdraw €500" before you can withdraw the rest - they actually processed this withdrawal - but then they went back to saying there was technical issues or unknown errors, but then why did you process the €500 OK?</p>
<p>I am fully verified, although they kept asking for more and more information on that to stall as well- but I have now sent them ID, selfies, bank balances, pay slips, everything has been approved after delay some time ago.</p>
<p>Here are some of the excuses:</p>
<p>I apologize for the inconvenience caused by your withdrawal request for €3,604.00 being denied. I reviewed the account and apologized, but I am unable to determine why it was refused.</p>
<p>I have, however, escalated this problem to the Payments team for additional review; I will provide an update if we hear any information from them.</p>
<hr />
<p>We recently learned that our Payment team approved the withdrawal request for all of our customers, but the payment provider rejected it for unknown reasons, leaving us in confusion.</p>
<p>But don't worry, we're working on it and simply waiting for them to give us an update.</p>
<hr />
<p>I apologize for the inconvenience caused by your withdrawal request on 11/27 for € 4,104.00 being rejected. I reviewed the account and apologized, but I am unable to determine why it was refused.</p>
<hr />
<p>The issue was happening because you are using EUR and it was unexpected due the location, but we have fixed here.</p>
<p>So you should see your balance back in your wallet, and request the withdrawal again through the crypto 1.</p>
