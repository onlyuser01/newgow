    <h1>Mount Airy Casino Pa Ballys Quad Cities Casino Southpoint Casino Las Vegas Casino Royal Club Walker</h1>

<p>Gaming Realms, one of the most promising and innovative developers of casino content and games, has announced that it has signed a content alliance with Admiral Casino in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Admiral Casino is an established and trusted brand name in the gambling market in the United Kingdom. The casino is powered by Greentube, a prominent developer of content and solutions for the iGaming industry itself.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Admiral Casino will have the opportunity to access a range of Gaming Realms’ original Slingo titles, many of which are reimaginations of classic and blockbuster slot games. Amongst those are Slingo Sweet Bonanza, Slingo Starburst, Slingo Da Vinci Diamonds, and Slingo Reel King all of which are available in the casino and will strengthen the operator’s offer and standing in the industry.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has long been treating the United Kingdom as one of its key markets and has been ambitiously expanding there. Gaming Realms CCO Gareth Scott has welcomed the opportunity to work closely with Admiral Casino once again, arguing that the brand was indeed a respected and proven operator.</p>
<p>"Our games are continuing to grow in popularity in the UK and we are thrilled to take further market share and reach new audiences with this deal," Scott added. Greentube UK Director of B2C Operation Richard Poole was similarly happy with the chance to see Gaming Realms’ content portfolio added to the operator’s library. He argued that the brand is constantly looking forward to adding more innovative titles that appeal to a wider demographic.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has also been recalibrating its executive lineup, adding Suki Sandhu as its newest Chief Product Officer earlier this month. As a supplier, Gaming Realms has been appreciated across numerous jurisdictions, including the United States.</p>
<p>The company also signed a major partnership with bet365, a leading gaming and betting company with an established footprint across international markets.</p>
<p>Much of Gaming Realms’ success story is owing to its long-standing dedication to creating a brand-new vertical that combines the best of both bingo and slots to produce an apt product. The Slingo vertical has gathered momentum and established itself as a preferred option among players.</p>
