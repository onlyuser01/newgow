    <h1>Casino Payson Az Motorcity Casino Hotel Wynn Casino Casinos Hiring In Las Vegas Nevada Beau Rivage R</h1>

<p>Official data, technology and commercial partner that powers sports, betting and media Genius Sports announced today a joint partnership with the Icelandic Club Association (ÍTF) and the Icelandic Football Association (KSI) to help accelerate soccer growth in Iceland and worldwide.</p>
<p>Data and Video Capturing and Distribution Rights</p>
<p>The long-term agreement between Genius Sports and the ITF and KSI granted the sports betting data and content supplier the exclusive rights to capture official data and live video streams of both soccer associations in Iceland and utilize its global network of betting partners to commercialize data and live streams-driven content.</p>
<p>“This partnership with the ÍTF and KSI is an excellent example of the Genius Sports partnership model and the value we provide,” commented the head of commercial partnerships for the EMEA region at Genius Sports Jonny Katanchian.</p>
<p>“Icelandic football will benefit from our global reach, unique free-to-play and official data capabilities to help expand their sport. Sportsbooks will also be provided with the fastest, highest quality data and video content across thousands of events per year during off-peak windows.” Jonny Katanchian, Head of Commercial Partnerships, EMEA, Genius Sports</p>
<p>Genius’ sportsbook partners will have access to the new weekly and season-long content during off-peak windows outside of the global soccer calendar under the joint agreement, to deliver more engaging digital experiences for the sports fans.</p>
<p>‘There Are Enormous Opportunities Ahead’</p>
<p>Customized fantasy games, including weekly and salary cap modes, pick’em, trivia and predictor tools will be at ITF’s disposal to choose from to test the knowledge of its fans and establish an understanding of their content preferences, much to the satisfaction of ITF chief executive officer Birgir Jóhannsson, who outlined the “untiring effort during last year to market these rights” was now “bearing fruit.”</p>
<p>“These agreements, and those that will follow, will make sure that Icelandic football reaches its next step, for everyone’s benefit, including the clubs, the players and the domestic football community as a whole. There are enormous opportunities ahead,” Jóhannsson concluded.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the partnership, the director of commercial and marketing at KSI Stefán Gunnarsson expressed his contentment “to have concluded the contracts” with Genius Sports, one of the leading companies in the sports betting data field, eager to begin the partnership for the upcoming cycle.</p>
<p>Following the landmark collective deal the ITF and KSI struck in October last year with the European Leagues to broadcast live matches and highlights on ELEVEN and OneFootball, the partnership with Genius Sports will help propel Icelandic soccer to the next level, supported by the launch of a new Media Hub that will collate all matches data and video content.</p>
<p>Both soccer associations will take advantage of Genius Sports’ Integrity Services, including the firm’s 24/7 bet monitoring technology and educational capabilities such as workshops to players, coaches and other participants, to support their efforts to protect the sport from the threats of match-fixing and corruption related to sports betting.</p>
<p>The agreement with the ITF and KSI followed in the footsteps of a similar agreement Genius Sports signed with the Canadian Football League (CFL) in December to help growth acceleration and new audience engagement of the league.</p>
