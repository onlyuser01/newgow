<p>Lottery players around the world can now have access to instant lottery results after the launch of the LottoHub app announced today by Kings Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>Instant Lottery Results from Popular Global Operators</p>
<p>The launch by Kings Entertainment Group, the parent company of global online gaming brands LottoKings and WinTrillion, will allow avid lottery players worldwide to use the Android-based LottoHub app that has been approved by Google Play Store and is already available for download.</p>
<p>“We’ve created a product that will target enthusiastic lottery customers globally, and particularly those in Latin American countries, a key market for our lottery offerings. Android is the predominant platform for mobile devices across the region and our goal was to create a must-have app for lottery aficionados in this market.” Steve Budin, CEO, Kings Entertainment</p>
<p>Established in 2005, the parent of international online service providers for a lottery, casino, and sportsbook LottoKings and WinTrillion, will significantly expand its audience of targeted end-users via the launch of the LottoHub app, leveraging cross-promotion of its brands in a global market that is expected to grow by 4% annually and reach $434 billion by the end of 2026. For comparison, the market was valued at $336 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>“This app will identify players with strong potential for our other lottery products, and will contribute to our growth strategy. We’re essentially ‘bringing the haystack to the needle’ – and creating a huge advantage in qualifying potential customers.” Steve Budin, CEO, Kings Entertainment</p>
<p>Instant Viewing and Alarm Setting Options</p>
<p>The LottoHub app presents lottery players with ease of use while checking the results from a number of popular lotteries globally, as well as personalization options, including selecting up to 10 favorite lotteries for instant viewing. The app also allows for alerts based on personal preferences to be created.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Kings Entertainment Group listed its shares for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), seeking to gain access to a broader capital base and fuel its international expansion. With an already strong presence in Latin America, the lottery group intends to use that solid foundation as a springboard for growth in the burgeoning US and European gaming markets.</p>
