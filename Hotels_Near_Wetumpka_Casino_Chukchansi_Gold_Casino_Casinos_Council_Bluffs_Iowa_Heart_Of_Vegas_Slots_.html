    <h1>Hotels Near Wetumpka Casino Chukchansi Gold Casino Casinos Council Bluffs Iowa Heart Of Vegas Slots</h1>

<p>an example from CasinoStremer88 from Austria</p>
<p>Hello dear Heybets team!</p>
<p>I have a question, I live in Austria and was able to register with you &amp; deposit money and not just once.</p>
<p>Why do you even give players the opportunity to register with you even though it's a restricted country?</p>
<p>And why do you accept deposits?</p>
<p>By then you have to notice that people are playing from countries that are restricted.</p>
<p>I'm addressing this because of Armin's complaint.</p>
<p>You allowed him to register &amp; pay money.</p>
<p>You also confirmed and transferred a payout of â‚¬1000 to him twice.</p>
<p>In all this time you have NOT noticed that the player is from Germany?</p>
<p>You also had a conversation in which a German obviously wrote to your customer Armin.</p>
<p>All these factors and many more clearly show that you knew exactly where the player came from.</p>
<p>You didn't find it necessary to block the player &amp; also to advertise on your home page with Germany.</p>
<p>For example, I can register with you right now and deposit money.</p>
<p>I think all of these are mistakes on your part and the player Armin can't help it that you make mistakes &amp; certainly not at all he can know that you will be banned from playing if he has successfully received 2 payments and you have congratulated him on it.</p>
<p>The way you ignored the player afterwards is also a disgusting act on your part.</p>
<p>I think you should pay the player and make sure in the future that players from restricted countries can't even register.</p>
<p>The other casinos can do it too!</p>
<p>With the others, you can't get to the page at all because it is automatically blocked.</p>
<p>I think it's cheeky and a scam to present the player as guilty so that you don't have to pay.</p>
<p>The only correct answer to this complaint would be to pay the player in full!</p>
<p>And then to say that the deposits are not refundable because he had 2 withdrawals is even more ridiculous.</p>
<p>You're certainly not doing yourself any favors with this campaign, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
