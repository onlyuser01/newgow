<p>The license enables the gambling operator to offer legally online games of chance to customers in the Netherlands</p>
<p>The Netherlands opened its online gambling market in October 2021. This enabled licensed operators in the country to offer their services legally to Dutch customers while adhering to the established regulations. Now, the gambling regulator in the Netherlands, the Dutch Gaming Authority, Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), revealed that a new operator secured a license to offer its services.</p>
<p>On Monday, the regulator revealed that it awarded Hommerson Amusement BV with a Dutch gambling license. This in other words means that the operator can now legally offer games of chance via the internet to customers in the country.</p>
<p>Although Hommerson Amusement secured a license, it is yet to be confirmed which domain name would be used by the new operator. The KSA revealed that once the operator confirms its domain name, it will be added to its Gambling Guide, an online register that lists all providers that are allowed to offer legal games of chance in the Netherlands. For the convenience of the users, the gambling regulator has listed all licenses, including their trading name and domain or domains.</p>
<p>The latest license complements the growth of the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands. Securing the approval designated Hommerson Amusement as the 27th legal Dutch online gambling services provider.</p>
<p>“The Gaming Authority (Ksa) has granted a license to Hommerson Amusement BV to offer games of chance via the internet. This is the 27th permit for an online provider that the KSA has granted,“ reads a statement released by Kansspelautoriteit</p>
<p>The Gambling Regulator Continues to Monitor the Market</p>
<p>Besides licensing, the Dutch gambling regulator oversees compliance. It also actively monitors the market, proposing best practices that can reduce gambling harm and excessive gambling from customers in the country.</p>
<p>Last month, the KSA urged gambling operators in the Netherlands to do more to protect their clients. The call came from the regulator’s chairman, René Jansen, who unveiled details regarding a new probe into the gambling sector. At the time, he encouraged licensed gambling operators to implement more measures to protect their customers from excessive gambling and harm.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jansen warned about the dangers of the illegal gambling markets. He reiterated that illegal gambling operators do not adhere to any player protection rules and have no duty of care to protect the consumers.</p>
<p>Late last month, Prof. Dr. Arnt F.A. Schellekens, the National Rapporteur on Addictions, pitched 22 points to reform gambling. The recommendations included mandatory playing limits and ramped-up player protection, among other important changes.</p>
