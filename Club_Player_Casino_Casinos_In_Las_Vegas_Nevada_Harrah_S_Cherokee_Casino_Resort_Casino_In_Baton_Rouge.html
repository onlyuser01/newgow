    <h1>Club Player Casino Casinos In Las Vegas Nevada Harrah S Cherokee Casino Resort Casino In Baton Rouge</h1>

<p>It takes a certain kind of person to want to try to commit a crime at a casino. It’s not like there aren’t cameras and other types of surveillance equipment everywhere. Getting away with the crime isn’t very likely, but perhaps those individuals just like the gamble. One recent criminal mastermind is now behind bars after shooting a security guard at the Santa Fe Station Casino in Las Vegas earlier this month. With his history, he isn’t likely to see freedom for a very long time.</p>
<p>Santa Fe Shooting Has a Happy Ending</p>
<p>A Henderson man was suspected of shooting a Santa Fe Casino security guard on December 16. He was trying to cash a false City of Las Vegas payroll check at a casino cage at the time. According to the arrest report, Michael Kasper, walked into the property and went directly to a cashier’s cage. There, he attempted to cash a $1,981 check.</p>
<p>Anomalies in the check led to the casino calling the city’s payroll department. They confirmed that no check had been sent to Kasper. Kasper’s check had blurry prints and had a forged signature.</p>
<p>The employee at the casino called her manager, who then notified security. Kasper tried to flee, but was stopped by the security guard. A fight ensued and a group of security guards, including Winston Bouman, then took Kasper to the floor and tried to pin him down. According to the arrest report, Kasper reached into his pocket and pulled out a gun. Kasper shot Bouman in his left thigh twice while he was on the ground.</p>
<p>According to the arrest report, security took Kasper to a secure area. He stayed there until he was taken into custody by police. In the meantime, the guard was taken to UMC Trauma, where he was in stable condition following the extraction of both bullets.</p>
<p>Violent Past Catches Up With Him</p>
<p>Police arrested the 33-year-old following the shooting. He is currently being held at Clark County Detention Center, where he faces charges of attempted murder, possessing forgeries or bills and attempted theft. Those are just a few of the charges pending, and others could be tacked on. The final list depends on how far prosecutors want to go.</p>
<p>In 2009, Kasper was convicted of armed robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery and armed burglary. According to police, it was a single occurrence that did not pose a danger to the public. While the investigation was ongoing, police closed down one section of the casino, but the rest of the operations continued.</p>
<p>According to court records, Kasper has already made his first court appearance. A criminal complaint will be filed on March 17 of next year.</p>
