<p>St. Louis City Wants Another Win</p>
<p>The Western Conference leader beat Austin FC the first time they met. It was 3-2 for the Texans, who played in front of their own crowd. Now, six months after that win, St. Louis City players are planning to do the same.</p>
<p>What needs to worry them is that their recent form hasn’t been great. In fact, they lost both of their Leagues Cup games, scoring just one goal along the way, while conceding five. However, just before the MLS went on a break, they defeated Inter Miami 3-0 at home. Still, one must remember that it was the pre-Messi Inter Miami, which was nothing short of horrible.</p>
<p>One thing that should make St. Louis City’s fans optimistic about Sunday’s game is that most of their key players are 100% fit and ready to play. We say “most” because their arguably best striker Joao Klauss remains sidelined.</p>
<p>Austin FC Has Been Horrible on the Road</p>
<p>Austin FC is 9-5-9 in the 2023 MLS, which accounts for 32 points. However, only 11 of those these guys won in away matches. What’s worse is that their form on the road has been horrible over the last couple of months. In fact, the Texans are 1-1-3 in their last five away games in the MLS.</p>
<p>Another fact that should worry them ahead of their trip to Missouri is that they’ve conceded at least one goal in each of their away games since July 2022. It’s been more than 13 months since they kept a clean sheet on the road the last time.</p>
<p>St. Louis City vs. Austin FC Prediction</p>
<p>St, Louis City didn’t end up on the top of the MLS Western Conference table by accident. This is a force that should be reckoned with. They were able to beat Austin FC 3-2 on the road, and we have no doubt they can do the same at home.</p>
