<p>Fruit Shop Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fruit Shop Megaways has a summery fruit machine theme.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves out on a sunny day, enjoying the blue sky and greenery. At a bustling fruit stand, they’ll eye up tasty treats from plums to watermelons to lemons.</p>
<p>This game will appeal to players who enjoy fruit machine slots and those in the mood for an uplifting atmosphere.</p>
<p>Win in the Fruit Shop Megaways slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The low-key soundtrack is filled with cheerful notes that set the tone for a day in the sun. Occasional bird song helps establish the outdoorsy setting.</p>
<p>The animation quality is simple but colourful and appealing. The produce symbols are illustrated in a cartoon style featuring classic fruit machine items like cherries and lemons.</p>
<p>The reels are crafted to look like a fruit stand with an orange striped awning. Sturdy wooden walls stand on either side of the reels, contributing to a small town farmers’ market vibe.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, players will see minimalistic graphics of park greenery, reinforcing the summer day setting.</p>
<p>Overall, the music and animations are simple, but the vibrant colours are welcoming and optimistic.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fruit Shop Megaways uses the Megaways system, meaning that the number of symbols in each reel varies for each spin.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going right.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols. The Wild symbols can land on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the base game as well as the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is activated by landing a win with any of the medium-value symbols.</p>
<p>Selection of symbols that can award the Free Spins feature</p>
<p>While in the Free Spins feature, players can be awarded additional free spins when they are awarded a win for medium or low-paying symbols. The number of free spins they win varies depending on the type of symbol and the length of the winning combination.</p>
<p>Players begin the Free Spins feature with a x1 multiplier. They are awarded an increase of +1 to this multiplier for every win during the feature with a maximum multiplier of x10.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 93.01%, very much below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>Top paying symbols paytable for the Fruit Shop Megaways slot</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>With high volatility, Fruit Shop Megaways would normally be a good fit for our recommended strategies. However, due to its low RTP, this slot falls short of strategy-friendly status.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility fruit machine slot.</p>
<p>Despite a cheery classic theme and high volatility, Fruit Shop Megaway’s RTP of 93.01% is simply too low to merit a recommendation.</p>
<p>Players would do well to take their fruit machine cravings to a game that can offer a better RTP.</p>
