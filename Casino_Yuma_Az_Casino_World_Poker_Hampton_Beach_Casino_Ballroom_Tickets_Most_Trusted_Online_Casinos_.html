<p>Gaming Corps, the fast-growing Swedish games developer, powering the online gambling industry, announced a new deal with Skywind Group, the leading Romanian gaming company. Under the terms of the new freshly-minted content deal, Gaming Crops agreed to supply its complete suite of games for the operator.</p>
<p>As a result, Skywind Group's brands in Romania will benefit from thrilling titles from the Swedish games developer. The company's flagship websites, including Luck.com, cashpot.ro, Magnumbet and Princess Casino will deliver thrilling and engaging games from Gaming Corps.</p>
<p>Such games include the recent hits, Aztec Bonus Pot, as well as Raging Zeus, granting a chance for significant payouts. Additionally, Skywind Group's brands will be able to access Gaming Corps' portfolio of premium Mine, Crash, Table and Slot games, including fan-favorite titles like 777 Jackpot Diamond Hold and Win, Plinko, Penalty Champion and Coin Miner, among other leading games.</p>
<p>Daniela Asaftei, Skywind Group's Head of CRM, shared her excitement in a statement. "We are delighted to be able to offer Gaming Corpsâ€™ exciting and modern games to our players," she said. Finally, Asaftei pointed out: "This will allow us to expand our offering and present players with even more premium casino and video games as we further strengthen our brands."</p>
<p>Currently, Gaming Corps' games stand out with thrilling features and quality animations. Additionally, the company's iGaming content delivers engaging and innovative mechanics that create exciting experiences for online players.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Gaming Corps expanded once again the reach of its content by teaming up with St8, a leading casino games aggregation platform.

Similarly, the latest deal with Skywind Group enables Gaming Corps to continue expanding its global footprint and reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Danielle Calafato, Gaming Corps' Chief Commercial Officer, was delighted about the new collaboration with Skywind Group.
