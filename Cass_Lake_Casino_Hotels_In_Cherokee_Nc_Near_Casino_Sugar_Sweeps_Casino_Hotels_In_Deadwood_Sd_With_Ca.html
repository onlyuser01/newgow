<p>Playtech has struck a new partnership with Entain’s Ladbrokes in the United Kingdom. The company has introduced its proprietary Well Well Well Live product to the casino platform. The game was developed by Playtech’s dedicated software and live studio in Riga and will be streamed from there.</p>
<p>Playtech Adds More Features, Games to Ladbrokes UK Portfolio</p>
<p>Playtech can enjoy a high production value as one of the leading European technology and software suppliers in the industry. The new edition comes with a unique product that will significantly improve the experience for the player through optimized UX that translates into better gameplay.</p>
<p>This collaboration for the Ladbrokes brand is not the beginning but rather the continuation of a highly-successful relationship between Entain and Playtech. As part of the partnership, Playtech is adding Rainbow Rewards which will now feature three new bonus rounds designed to improve the gameplay further.</p>
<p>They include the Buckets of Gold, Magic Reels and Rainbow Pays features. Commenting on this extended partnership, Entain live casino commercial and product manager Adam James Lahouiri said:</p>
<p>“We are delighted to bring the best of our in-house slots branding to a game show exclusively for the Ladbrokes brand; this cements our position as the home of game shows, thanks to the joint effort and collaboration between Playtech, Ladbrokes &amp; CR games.” Entain live casino commercial and product manager Adam James Lahouiri</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed on a similar note by Playtech Live head of live casino innovation Kevin Kilminster who said that the company was honored to be expanding its innovative products with another Entain brand.</p>
<p>Playtech Continues to Provide Ladbrokes UK</p>
<p>He confirmed that the arrival of the new product and features was reflective of how Playtech was constantly attempting to introduce bespoke titles for partner brands and their customers to enjoy.</p>
<p>When you combine gameplay and the presentation perspective with the talented Playtech Live studio production team, you are looking at the best studio experience in the business.</p>
<p>Playtech is actively delivering games for the Entain Group and to brands such as Coral and Ladbrokes. The company has worked on some tailored options for Entain’s brands to consolidate both companies’ presence in the igaming sector as purveyors of unique experiences.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Playtech continues to report strong results and the company has been actively looking into expanding its team in the United States.</p>
