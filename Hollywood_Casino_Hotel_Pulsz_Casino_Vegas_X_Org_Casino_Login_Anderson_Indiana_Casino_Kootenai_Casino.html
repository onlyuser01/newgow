<p>Parions Sport, the sports betting brand of Française des Jeux (FDJ), continued to expand its presence across French sport after an agreement with Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain made the brand the soccer club’s principal betting partner.</p>
<p>€5M-A-Year Three-Year Deal</p>
<p>The new agreement between Parions Sport and PSG is scheduled to commence from the 2022-23 Ligue 1 season and according to media reports in l’Equipe, will see the sports betting brand fork out €5 million ($5.5 million) per season in a three-year partnership.</p>
<p>Parions Sport is set to replace PSG’s current betting partner, Kindred Group’s Unibet, which has been a sponsor of the soccer club from the French capital since the 2018-19 Ligue 1 season. Parions Sport’s parent FDJ is yet to confirm the new partnership, the biggest ever for its flagship sports betting brand.</p>
<p>Kindred’s Unibet will stay as a principal betting partner of the French soccer giant until the 2022-23 season, having triggered the two-year extension clause in its sponsorship agreement which was set to expire in 2020.</p>
<p>The agreement with PSG is the second high-profile French sports deal Parions Sport had entered into over the past two months, following the agreement with France’s rugby federation in January.</p>
<p>Gain Domestic Ground on International Competition</p>
<p>The two-year sponsorship made FDJ’s sportsbook brand the official team sponsor of Fédération Française de Rugby’s (FFR) Men’s and Women’s XV teams. Parions Sport will receive brand visibility across FFR’s official media, as well as at the stadium during home games of the French teams.</p>
<p>FFR will also receive exposure via digital content across Parions Sport’s networks and social media, utilizing FDJ’s partnership with 27,000 unique merchant brands to distribute and promote the sport. In addition, FFR will receive support from the sports betting brand in relation to the upcoming 2023 RFU Rugby World Cup.</p>
<p>The agreements with FFR and PSG materialized after a significant boost to Parions Sport’s marketing budget from its parent company, seeking to enhance the market appeal of its flagship sports betting brand amid international competition.</p>
<p>As part of those efforts to gain the edge over international players in the sports betting space was Parions Sport’s nationwide TV advertising campaign named “We Are the Bettors” which launched earlier in March.</p>
