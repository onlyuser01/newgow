<p>M88 Mansion is joining the hype and build-up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup by signing Steven Gerrard, a retired soccer player and present soccer manager, who will serve as the brand’s new ambassador. M88 Mansion has been actively building up its presence in Asia, which it largely considers as its own stomping ground and Gerrard’s figure is prominent in the markets targeted by the company presently.</p>
<p>Gerrard to Give M88 Mansion a Boost with Soccer Fans</p>
<p>The ambassador and the operator will focus on bolstering the company’s positions in the Southeast Asian market and engage with local sports and soccer fans through digital channels and various promotional activities tailored to regional preferences. Gerrard himself was excited to be joining a respected regional sportsbook and said:</p>
<p>“I am delighted to join M88 Mansion as their brand ambassador for the World Cup. I couldn’t be more excited to share my experiences from my time on the field, especially my views and opinion to the Asian sports fans regarding the upcoming World Cup.” Steven Gerrard</p>
<p>M88 Mansion head of commercial Alan Wafer was similarly pleased to see Gerrard join as part of the company’s 2022 World Cup promotional efforts. He said that having the Liverpool legend and soccer ace join M88 was an honor.</p>
<p>Gerrard scored 186 goals in 710 appearances between 1998 and 2015. He has been a Liverpool loyalist for most of his career before moving to Major League Soccer and supporting LA Galaxy’s grassroots efforts in helping the United States become better at soccer.</p>
<p>Ambassadorships Help Establish Brand Success</p>
<p>Gerrard is also M88’s first official ambassador for the upcoming World Cup in Qatar this month. Previously, the company signed other prominent athletes, such as Manny Pacquiao and Michael Owen. Ambassadorship has been a powerful way to attract new audiences and use the image and likeness of existing athletes to help build up the name and recognition of certain brands.</p>
<p>BRBET teamed up with Mike Tyson ahead of the World Cup as well and is promoting its brand with the legendary boxer’s help. FUN88 also signed Ilker Casillas as the World Cup 2022 ambassador itself. Both FUN88 and M88 Mansion compete in Asian markets.</p>
