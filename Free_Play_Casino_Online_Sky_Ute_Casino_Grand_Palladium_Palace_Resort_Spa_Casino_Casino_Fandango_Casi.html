    <h1>Free Play Casino Online Sky Ute Casino Grand Palladium Palace Resort Spa Casino Casino Fandango Casi</h1>

<p>On 3rd of March, 2023, I tried to log-in to my ComeOn account. Without any warning, I got a message "Your account has been closed, please contact the customer service." This same thing happened to each of my account at the ComeOn group: The one at ComeOn, one at Suomikasino, one at Mobilebet, one at Nopeampi and one at Galaksino. I contacted the customer service asking what is going on and few days later got an answer:</p>
<p>We would kindly like to reach out to you since you have breached our T&amp;Cs that you accepted when you created an account on our website, our relevant department has decided to close your account permanently. As written in our Terms &amp; Conditions, 9.3 If, at the Company's sole determination, you are found to have cheated or attempted to defraud the service or the Company in any way including but not limited to game manipulation, chip dumping, transfers, or payment fraud, or if you make untrue and/or malicious comments with regard to the Company's operation in any media or forum, the Company reserves the right to publicize your actions as well as to circulate this information to other online gaming sites, banks, credit card companies, and appropriate agencies. Furthermore, the Company may close any accounts, and forfeit account balances, that you have at the Company or at any other Company-related webSite and/or business.</p>
<p>This is of course a completely silly justification. I have done none of the things listed above. I asked ComeOn to clarify what is going on, but they haven't replied to any of my questions since then.</p>
<p>Over the last year, I have mainly been participating in Wespin-sessions ComeOn has been offering. They are a group play sessions hosted by ComeOn (https://www.comeon.com/fi/we-spin), where players like me can participate in a gambling session by a streamer. At the end of the session, the remaining balance is distributed back to the participants proportionally to the participation amount. For example, if initial starting balance is 2000€, and you put in 400€, you will get 400€/2000€ = 20% back of the ending balance once the session ends. Sometimes this ending balance is 0€, sometimes it is 2000€, sometimes it is 3333€. The streamers are playing slot games with the money, after all.</p>
<p>In many of the sessions, ComeOn included add-on balances to encourage people to join. For example, if initial starting balance is 2000€ and ComeOn added 200€ to the balance, and you put in 400€, you will get 400/1800= 22.2% back of the he ending balance once the session ends. I usually participated big in these Wespin-sessions, risking few hundreds € to up to about 1000€ per sesssion.</p>
<p>On 26 of February, 2023, a streamer got really lucky in a Wespin session I had participated in with a big entry: he hit a max win on a game, which lead him to cashout about 50,000€. I think I won about 4500€ from that session. Afterwards, on the same day, that same streamer hit another huge win in another Wespin-session, leading to another ~50,000€ cashout. I think my share was about 5000€ from that. After I continued participating in Wespin-session as before, winning in some and losing in some, until 4th of March came and suddenly I could no longer log-in to my account. At that same time, ComeOn group also closed my other accounts, which I have occasionally used for Wepsins, but mainly for Sportsbetting. That disputed amount includes my balance in all 5 casinos combined, although majority of it on Comeon.com.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, none of the money is bonus money. It is all money I've deposited, risked and won from sports betting and Wespin group sessions. If ComeOn doesn't want me as customer, so be it, but they have zero justification confiscate my money just because I happened to win.</p>
