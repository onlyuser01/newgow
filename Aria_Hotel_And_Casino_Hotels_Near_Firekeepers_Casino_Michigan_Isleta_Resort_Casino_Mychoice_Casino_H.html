    <h1>Aria Hotel And Casino Hotels Near Firekeepers Casino Michigan Isleta Resort Casino Mychoice Casino H</h1>

<p>In December 2022, I was using my Interwetten account regularly without problems. At some point in the middle of December, I was asked to verify my account in order to continue using Interwetten sportsbook.</p>
<p>At that point, I have uploaded both sides of my driver's licence, and also my bank statement as a proof of my address. For some reason, my bank statement was rejected as a proof of address, so I have sent a regular utility bill instead.</p>
<p>After that point, every time I login onto my Interwetten account, it says that my account has been locked and that I should contact their service team.</p>
<p>I have sent e-mails to servic­e.e­n@i­nte­rwe­tte­n.com which went unanswered.</p>
<p>I have tried to use their chat on website multiple times, where the last time I have received an answer was on January 21st, when I was told that the request was forwarded to the relevant department.</p>
<p>I have even tried several times to contact them by phone, where I was told by their agents that the verification department was still reviewing my case, and that there is not another way of contacting that team other than mail to which they do not reply.</p>
<p>I understand that verification process cannot be completed instantly, but at this point I feel it is getting ridiculous with the timeframe of 3 months, and worst of all is I do not get feedback at all from them.</p>
<p>If there is something additional that they require from me, I would be happy to assist them in any way I can, but from my point of view they are not doing anything, and have frozen my funds without any basis.</p>
<p>If there is anyway you can help me with this problem, I would be much obliged.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
