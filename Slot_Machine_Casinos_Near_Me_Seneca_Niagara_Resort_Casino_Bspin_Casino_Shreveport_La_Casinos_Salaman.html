<p>The innovative provider of iGaming content, HungryBear Gaming, has struck a milestone partnership with Light &amp; Wonder, which will allow the company to have its products distributed through the latter’s powerful aggregation platform.</p>
<p>The partnership kicks off with the delivery of the Slot Masters title which will be distributed globally. Slot Masters is an innovative gameplay concept developed by HungryBear and focusing on a multiplayer slot experience with a clear strategic element, and which is presently only available as a free-to-play game.</p>
<p>Thanks to OPENGAMING, Light &amp; Wonder will be able to directly inject the promising game into the library of games of hundreds of suppliers who may be interested in it and in markets where HungryBear Gaming has a license to provide such content. As to the title itself, it’s a free-to-play head-to-head game. The title breaks away from traditional form and pits players in a versus-type battle.</p>
<p>Players in turn have the opportunity to make attacks and defenses through the use of specific weapons, which enrich the gameplay with strategic depth and a brand-new way to approach what is a traditional segment. Slot Masters has already launched with a number of tier-one operators and has been welcomed by players and businesses as a ground-breaking solution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the game is also being prepared to launch with even more operators in Europe and beyond. Most of these operators will feature Slot Masters as a separate category of games to make it standout and introduce it to more players. HungryBear Gaming though is not only going to stick to a F2P version, as the company is already working hard to release the real money version of Slot Masters. Presently, the company is looking at an end of 2022 delivery date.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder VP Game Development Robert Procter welcomed this new game and what it means for the industry as a whole. "The product is a true definition of innovation and the ability for players to go head-to-head on slots is ground-breaking for this industry," Procter said praising the genuine innovative value of Slot Masters.</p>
<p>He was joined by HungryBear Gaming CEO and Founder Justin Chamberlin who was equally confident in the game’s prospects, and who said that joining Light &amp; Wonder’s OPENGAMING’s platform was a complete game changer that is opening the door to an array of global brands that will be able to quickly integrate the title and bring it to even more audiences.</p>
