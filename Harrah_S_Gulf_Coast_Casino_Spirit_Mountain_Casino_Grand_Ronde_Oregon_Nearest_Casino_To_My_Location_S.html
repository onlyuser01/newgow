<p>Dear Nathalie,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem, but please understand that casinos don’t accept deposits from 3rd parties. By registering an account, your husband agreed to terms and conditions of the casino. In this specific case there is written https://www.greenplay.com/info/terms/ :</p>
<p>"You hereby confirm and acknowledge that:</p>
<p>The credit/debit card details, or those of any other means of payment used to deposit funds in Your Player Account, given by You when you register to use The Company Services, are those of the registered Player Account holder and such cards are not stolen or reported lost. Without derogating from the aforementioned, should You use a credit/debit card or any other form of payment which is not in Your private and personal name, We will presume that You have received complete and sufficient consent from the rightful owner and/or the person whom name is used on such payment instrument to make use of such payment instrument for the purposes herein, prior to Your engagement with Us."</p>
<p>"All payments into Your Player Account must be from a single payment source, such as a credit card, debit card or charge card, on which You are the named account holder. Deposit limits may apply depending on a number of parameters."</p>
<p>Please understand, that by depositing from 3rd party bank card your husband breached one of the main rules. Casino voided the winnings for this reason and I’m afraid it is an irreversible process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since the casino is not responsible for the lost funds deposited from 3rd party accounts, I’m afraid you won’t be entitled for any refunds. Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
