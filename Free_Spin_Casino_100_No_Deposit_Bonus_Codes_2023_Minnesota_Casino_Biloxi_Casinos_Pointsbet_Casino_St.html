    <h1>Free Spin Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Minnesota Casino Biloxi Casinos Pointsbet Casino St</h1>

<p>ALLSPINSWIN</p>
<p>I have been playing at this casino for years and have never had an issue with withdrawls , bonuses etc..until now!</p>
<p>I am a VIP player with the casino.</p>
<p>I deposited $50 and took free spins and won $112 from those free spins.</p>
<p>I played and completed all the wagering requirements before I started to increase my bet amounts.</p>
<p>I always play safe and usually will not exceed $5 bets unless im into the thousands .</p>
<p>Once I had reached over $1000 I increased my bets.</p>
<p>I got up to over $8K and played it down to $5k for withdrawl.</p>
<p>Once I had submitted my withdrawl I was told to verify all my documents , which was fine . It had been a while since my last withdrawl.</p>
<p>They returned my winnings because my documents failed. That was fine I sorted that out</p>
<p>I withdraw again.</p>
<p>I then receive an email stating I have breached their terms and conditions and withdrawl denied and only $50 returned to my account.</p>
<p>They said I placed a bet over €8 while still playing bonus. The bet amount was €10.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I dont believe this to be true</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I AM A VIP MEMBER AND THE TERMS SAY I AM ALLOWED BETS OF UP TO 30% NOT 20%</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>THEREFORE I DID NOT BREACH ANY TERMS .</p>
<p>Stay away from these theives!!!</p>
