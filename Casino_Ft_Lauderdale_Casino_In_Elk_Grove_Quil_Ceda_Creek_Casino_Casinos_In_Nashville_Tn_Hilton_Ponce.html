<p>The leading provider of games for the online gambling industry, Pragmatic Play, signed another important deal in Latin America. The company confirmed Tuesday it signed an agreement with Betcris, a leading operator for the region. Under the terms of the latest partnership, Pragmatic Play agreed to supply the operator with some of its most popular games.</p>
<p>Per the new agreement, Betcris gained access to games from the iGaming supplier's three different verticals, including Virtual Sports, Slots and Live Casino titles. The deal represents the debut of Pragmatic Play's thrilling games on Betcris.</p>
<p>As a result, more clients across Latin America will be able to access action-packed football, motorsport, as well as horse and greyhound racing games from Pragmatic Play's Virtual Sports portfolio.</p>
<p>Further games that will reach new customers include recent hits from the iGaming supplier, such as Spaceman and Zeus vs Hades - Gods of War. Not unexpectedly, customers of the operator will also be able to access award-winning classics from Pragmatic Play like Sugar Rush and Gates of Olympus, among others.</p>
<p>When it comes to Live Casino, Betcris will bring a range of new games from Pragmatic Play's portfolio, including hit titles like PowerUP Roulette and Sweet Bonanza Candyland, among others.</p>
<p>Mauricio Delgado, Betcris' Casino Manager, revealed in a statement that the company is thrilled to expand its offering with games from Pragmatic Play. "We’re anticipating a positive reaction from our players and positive impact upon our customer experience," he pointed out.</p>
<p>Victor Arias, Vice President of Latin American Operations at ARRISE powering Pragmatic Play, added: "It isn’t the number of signed deals as much as the quality of operators. Betcris provides us with another tremendous brand to showcase Pragmatic Play content." Finally, Arias outlined: "We couldn’t be happier to see Pragmatic Play products there."</p>
<p>The latest collaboration complements the growing presence of Pragmatic Play in the region. Many of the company's games have already proven their popularity in markets across Latin America and thanks to the deal with Betcris, the iGaming supplier will be able to reach even more customers than before.</p>
<p>Back in November, Pragmatic Play signed a European-facing deal. At the time, the company confirmed it joined forces with Niké, a leading gaming operator for the market in Slovakia. Thanks to that agreement, customers of the brand tapped into a wide range of hit games.</p>
