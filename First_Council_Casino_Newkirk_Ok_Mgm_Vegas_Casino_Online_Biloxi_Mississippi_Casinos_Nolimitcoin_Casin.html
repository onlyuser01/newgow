<p>Jelly Entertainment, a promising up and coming iGaming studio founded by industry veterans, is going to leverage a popular new mechanic from Big Time Gaming</p>
<p>The company is happy to tap into the Megaways feature which will be introduced and incorporated into its own game development processes and allow Jelly to further enhance its slot offer.</p>
<p>Revelling in the Megaways Experience with Jelly Entertainment</p>
<p>Megaways games are patented by Big Time Gaming which has been patenting it to third parties in the industry, generating further awareness for the segment and revenue from its unique creation. Now, Jelly Entertainment is the latest company to leverage this feature and implement it into its products which will focus on the UK market at first.</p>
<p>Jelly already has a game in production, Fury of Hyde Megaways, which is part of the broader signature series, Curious Cases. Players are promised “heart-pounding excitement” and a high volatility slot that will come with excellent bonus features and free spins.</p>
<p>Multipliers and boosts are also implemented in the core gameplay, adding to the variety and excitement that builds up as players anticipate realizing a solid win on the reels. The maximum multiplier is set at 10,000x as is the case with most Megaways games, too.</p>
<p>Victoria Newbolt, the marketing lead at Jelly Entertainment, has hailed the arrival of the Megaways feature as part of the developer’s strong portfolio of games. Newbolt said that any game studio would be happy to have the Big Time Gaming feature and benefit from it.</p>
<p>So far as production is concerned, Newbolt is confident that consumers will be happy with what is to follow. “We have some incredible Megaways slots in the works that’ll leverage the hugely popular mechanic but with our unique twist to ensure Jelly’s Megaways titles stand out in any operator game lobby,” she explained.</p>
<p>Jelly Entertainment Continues to Strengthen Its Position in iGaming</p>
<p>Jelly Entertainment recently joined Pariplay’s Ignite platform, giving the studio the opportunity to access a wide network of partners, but also a robust platform that helps with delivery and development, and further slashes costs for studios.</p>
<p>Jelly’s position as a disruptor is yet to be consolidated as the company continues to add to its list of games, and is expected to grow its product offering in the coming months. The Studios secured investment from EveryMatrix back in 2022 and is continuing to be a promising developer in the iGaming sector.</p>
