<p>Online gambling brand Betway continued to expand its presence in sports after a sponsorship deal with French Ligue 2 side Toulouse FC ensured brand visibility in the second echelon of French soccer.</p>
<p>Breaking Ground in French Soccer</p>
<p>The multi-year sponsorship agreement signed between Super Group-owned Betway and Ligue 2 Toulouse FC marked the first sponsorship deal for the betting and gaming brand with a soccer club in France to expand its presence across all top 5 European soccer destinations.</p>
<p>“Having built one of the most exciting and enviable global sport sponsorship portfolios of any industry, we’re very proud to be announcing our first partnership in France, as we’ve signed a multi-year agreement with Toulouse FC.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Betway will have its branding featured on the LED boards and panels at Stadium de Toulouse, home of the Ligue 2 soccer team. In addition, Betway logo will be present on the player’s kit at least until the end of the 2024 season.</p>
<p>“The club has great history and ambitions to get back into Ligue 1 and we look forward to supporting them on their journey,” concluded Werkman.</p>
<p>Betway head of marketing Brice Maurin outlined it took Betway 12 months of efforts to establish its brand in the country before having the “privilege” to announce its first sponsorship and add an ambitious club that is seeking to win back its place in the top soccer league in France like Toulouse to the brand’s “global portfolio of sponsorships.”</p>
<p>Betway and Toulouse will also collaborate in the digital space to create and deliver exclusive content across social media and other channels throughout their partnership.</p>
<p>Toulouse FC General Manager Olivier Jaubert could not hide his excitement that the soccer club became the first club chosen by the brand in France, looking forward to “working closely… to offer the best activation and implementation.”</p>
<p>“We are very pleased and proud to have such an important player of the global betting industry being associated as a Major sponsor to Toulouse Football Club. This is a key milestone that Betway joins us on a multi-year agreement to support the growth of the club and be part of our ambitious journey.” Olivier Jaubert, General Manager, Toulouse FC</p>
<p>Expanding Presence in European Soccer</p>
<p>The sponsorship deal with Toulouse FC further expanded Betway’s presence across all top five European soccer nations by adding the remaining top soccer destination on the continent, France.</p>
<p>In England, the brand is featuring via different partnerships with 13 clubs, including West Ham United and Leicester City of the EPL, while an official sports betting partnership with Atletico de Madrid ensured Betway exposure into Spain and LaLiga.</p>
<p>In Germany, Betway has brand visibility after betting partnership deals with VfB Stuttgart, Eintracht Frankfurt, and Hertha Berlin from the Bundesliga, as well as Werder Bremen and Schalke 04 from the second tier, while in Italy, the brand gained exposure across 45 Serie A fixtures during a season after the league implemented digital billboard replacement technology.</p>
