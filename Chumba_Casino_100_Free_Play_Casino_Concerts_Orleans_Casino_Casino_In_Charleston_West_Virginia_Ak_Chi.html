<p>After it was named a main sponsor of the Chile Open 2023 Tennis Championship last week, the leading global sports and casino online platform has announced Cayetano Rocafort as its new brand ambassador for Sweden. The news of the one-year contract comes after Betsson was crowned the top winner of the evening during the EGR Nordics Awards 2023 held in Malta on February 24, 2022.</p>
<p>There, the holding company that invests in fast-growing iGaming companies scooped up six awards including Sports Betting Operator of the Year, Operator of the Year, Employer of the Year, and Customer Service Operator.</p>
<p>Cayetano Rocafort, Ranked the Number One Padel Player in Sweden</p>
<p>The company took the news to their social media where it welcomed the player as its new brand ambassador in Sweden. Betsson also published a short clip accompanying the news, where Rocafort is seen doing what he knows how to do best while announcing that he is now “a proud member of the team Betsson” while wearing a Betsson-branded t-shirt.</p>
<p>Since 2021, the WPT player for the 2022 season has been ranked the number one padel player in Sweden. He is also known for designing and developing a professional padel series called the RS Cayetano Rocafort Edition “Sandy.” The series was developed together with RS Padel, a company that specializes in a wide plethora of products destined for padel and tennis players.</p>
<p>In 2021, the 1994-born player who is already enjoying a prosperous athletic life in Sweden announced his plans to stay in Sweden and become an official citizen of the country. Rocafort also expressed his desire to one day be a part of Sweden’s national padel team.</p>
<p>Betsson’s decision regarding its newly appointed brand ambassador came naturally, as the company was already a Padel Tour sponsor.</p>
<p>Discussing their move, sponsorship manager Linus Endahl spoke about the large number of padel aficionados at their company, suggesting that has been one of the reasons why Rocafort has made it on their prestigious roster of brand ambassadors. Ultimately, Endahl welcomed the player to their team and expressed hope for “even greater success for him going forward.”</p>
<p>Betsson will also be sponsoring the ATP Tour 250 event in Chile between February 27 and March 5. The event will be held at Santiago’s Club Deportivo Universidad Católica. The sponsorship is another reflection of the company’s “unwavering commitment to supporting sports and fostering growth” in the sports market in Chile while continuing to strengthen its foothold in the area.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Betsson announced it would go live on the Ontario market with the Betsafe brand.</p>
<p>At the start of the week, Betsson announced it would incorporate Neccton’s Mentor analytical application solution into Betsafe, providing it with anti-money laundering and responsible gambling tools.</p>
