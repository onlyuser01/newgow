<p>True Grit Redemption review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>True Grit Redemption has a moody Western theme.</p>
<p>Players will trudge through a snowy landscape to a rickety settlement. There, they’ll meet hardened cowboys, ruthless bandits, and savvy barmaids.</p>
<p>In this darker version of the Wild West, players will need to keep their pistols close to get through the night. Fans of the film True Grit as well the original novel of the same name may be especially drawn to this slot.</p>
<p>All it takes is one very lucky spin, combined with a x19 multiplier.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Wolf howls, horse whinnies, and tension inducing notes fill the soundtrack. The appropriately gritty music sets an ominous night-time atmosphere.</p>
<p>The reels seem to be crafted from rustic boards, and rough characters appear among the symbols. A woman with make-up running down her face blows the smoke from a gun, making it clear she can handle a duel.</p>
<p>A host of cowboys and villains also appear, each with iconic looks from eye-patches to sheriff-starred hats. It’s easy to imagine these rugged characters in a showdown together.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a spooky snow-scape. The darkness and the cold are palpable, and a crooked sign reads "point of no return."</p>
<p>Overall, the music and graphics combine to create a world of gloom and western drama.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The main reel consists of a 6x4 grid with a selection of locked positions that open in a diagonal pattern. Players open the first 4 positions with one Scatter symbol, then the next 3 positions with a second Scatter, the next 2 with a third Scatter, and the final position with a fourth Scatter.</p>
<p>Above the main reel, there are three additional positions. Here, players exclusively find Character symbols and Wild symbols.</p>
<p>Each scatter symbol hit unlocks new positions on the reels</p>
<p>Below the main reel are 4 additional locked positions. These places may be occupied by Character symbols and Special symbols.</p>
<p>A sticky Wild with a multiplier can be found locked in the rightmost position of the bottom set. This position is unlocked during Dead Spins (see further details below).</p>
<p>Wins are awarded in True Grit Redemption for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going to the right.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter and Grit Girl symbols.</p>
<p>When players land matching symbols in the topmost reel and the reel underneath, both symbols will turn into Wild symbols.</p>
<p>In the bottom reel, a stacked Wild waits with the potential to nudge to become fully visible, gaining an increase to a multiplier for each nudge.</p>
<p>Players can land the xWays symbol on any reel, except in the topmost position. Meanwhile, the Infectious xWays symbol only lands on the bottom reel.</p>
<p>The xWays symbol will change into 2-3 matching symbols, increasing the chance for wins.</p>
<p>xWays symbol splits into 2 or 3 pieces everytime it hits</p>
<p>When the Infectious xWays symbol is triggered, it will change into 2 matching symbols. However, it will also influence all other matching symbols to grow in size.</p>
<p>The Reel Split feature doubles all symbols on the main reel and is triggered by the Reel Split symbol.</p>
<p>The Transform ‘em symbol changes an entire symbol type to match each other. For example, all Character symbols will become the same character.</p>
<p>The Grit Girl symbol pays out as soon as it appears on 3+ reels, for example paying x25 of total bet when she lands or at least 3 reels. This payout increases to x500, should she land on 4 reels.</p>
<p>The Torture Spins feature is triggered when players land 3 Scatter symbols, starting with 8 free spins. During this feature, the game area is increased and some locked positions are opened.</p>
<p>The Dead Spins feature is triggered when players land 4 Scatter symbols, starting with 10 free spins. As with the previous feature, the game area increases, unlocking previously locked positions, including the bottom right Wild symbol.</p>
<p>The maximum payout of True Grit Redemption is x20,220 the player’s base bet. If this amount is exceeded, the round will conclude, awarding the maximum amount.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.11%, just about our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>With high volatility, True Grit Redemption is a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We recommend the strategy of targeting the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, high volatility western-themed slot.</p>
<p>With a great soundtrack and a moody aesthetic, this slot is engrossing. The high volatility and solid RTP make it an appealing find for mathematically inclined players.</p>
<p>The numerous bonus features ensure that True Grit Redemption stays novel and interesting.</p>
