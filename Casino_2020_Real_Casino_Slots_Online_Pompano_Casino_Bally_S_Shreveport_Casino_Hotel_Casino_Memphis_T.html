<p>Dear Tatiana2695,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your withdrawal issue.</p>
<p>Please understand, that the variety and accessibility of payment methods are not managed by the casino exclusively. Several factors as the Licensing Authority, geolocation, contracts with the payment providers, and bank restrictions, all have a major influence. If a payment method was available for deposits, it doesn’t mean necessarily, that it will be offered for withdrawals too, also it can be discontinued at any time. Unfortunately, casinos are sometimes powerless and limited in offering payment methods to their customers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if I understood correctly, and your funds are being held by MyFinity, I'm afraid we won't be able to help you. My only recommendation would be to contact the payment provider directly.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
