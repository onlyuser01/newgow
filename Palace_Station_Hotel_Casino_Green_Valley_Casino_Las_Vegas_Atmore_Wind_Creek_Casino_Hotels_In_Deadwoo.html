<p>Companies around the world offer different incentives for their employees. Bonuses, pay indexation, health benefits, dedicated play areas, gyms or free snacks are only a few of the perks that competitive companies implement while striving to get the most talented employees. While most companies offer fixed days for paid leave per month or annually, others throw in additional days or enable employees to purchase extra days of paid leave on an annual basis.</p>
<p>All of this sounds well, but it still cannot be compared to the unlimited paid leave policy implemented by Tom Horn Gaming, a leading iGaming software provider for the online gambling industry. On Thursday, the company revealed it has adopted a new policy for paid leave, allowing its employees to take paid leave when they need. The change, as announced by Tom Horn Gaming came into effect immediately.</p>
<p>Under the company's new holiday scheme, all of its employees will be able to take time off work without the need for a "fixed vacation day entitlement," a statement released on January 26, 2023, reveals. This means that Tom Horn Gaming shows significant trust in its employees and gives them the freedom to decide when and how to benefit from their time off.</p>
<p>Ondrej Lapides, Tom Horn Gaming's CEO, explained that the company can grow thanks to creativity and productivity. "This change focuses more on what our people do and not on how many hours or days they work," he explained.</p>
<p>Lapides outlined that to meet the challenges of the constantly changing environment, an agile approach is needed. This approach, according to him, can drive innovation in product development and also change the way employees take time off and work.</p>
<p>Viktoria Mykhailenko, Tom Horn Gaming's Head of HR, added: "The policy is meant to give our people flexibility to juggle their professional and personal lives more effectively, leading to an uptick in well-being and employee satisfaction."</p>
<p>She added that while the company is focused on transparency and trust, it still remains committed to delivering strong results and quality products. "We strongly believe this new approach to taking a break from work will increase productivity, encourage employee autonomy and establish a sense of empowerment of our colleagues," said Mykhailenko.</p>
<p>Founded more than a decade ago, Tom Horn Gaming is currently a leading supplier of real money gambling solutions for the growing iGaming industry. The company offers a strong portfolio of content that includes video slots, as well as different promotional tools. Its content stands out with engaging mathematical models, quality graphics and unique features. Currently, the company holds licenses in Malta, as well as the UK.</p>
