<p>Xpoint has launched its dedicated Xpoint Verify solution, a new addition to the company’s geolocation product portfolio which has now gone live with markets in the United States and specifically through Sporttrade. Xpoint focuses on bringing leading geolocation and compliance solutions to iGaming and sports wagering companies in the North American market.</p>
<p>Xpoint Verify Now Part of Sporttrade’s Offer</p>
<p>Sporttrade, on the other hand, is a company that creates opportunities for sports fans to participate in the wagering ecosystem by trading sports bets like stocks, and as part of what has been an increasingly popular form of gambling in recent years. Sporttrade, which operates in the New Jersey betting market, among others, is not the only company to offer a stock market-like experience for players in the sports betting sector. Earlier this week, Chris Rock and Thrive Capital-back platform Mojo launched in the Garden State as well.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Xpoint Verify will help Sporttrade to stay competitive in the market and comply with mandatory geolocation regulatory conditions. Xpoint brings “game-changing” geolocation and real money sports betting and iGaming solutions, the company said, commenting on the launch of this new collaboration.</p>
<p>Xpoint CEO and co-founder Marvin Sanderson welcomed the opportunity and said that it was a great opportunity for the company to be teaming up with the betting platform. He argued that Sporttrade is a revolutionary brand that is focused on innovating the entire sports betting sector in the United States. Sanderson added:</p>
<p>This announcement marks another milestone for Xpoint and will serve as a further accelerant for new customer acquisition, supporting our growth targets and helping us continue to transform our marketplace. Xpoint CEO and co-founder Marvin Sanderson</p>
<p>As pressure on companies to remain compliant grows so does the need for trusted technology partner grows. Xpoint Verify has proven itself as a go-to solution for operators that want to remain compliant with geolocation standards in the United States and the region as a whole.</p>
<p>The Companies to Continue Collaboration in Other States</p>
<p>Sporttrade CEO and founder Alex Kane commented on the deal and said that the company had felt strongly about working with Xpoint because of the innovative and rich industry experience it had. “Our companies share many attributes, and we are both focused on transforming our markets. We are delighted to have Xpoint as a core partner of ours,” Kane said.</p>
<p>He added that Xpoint goes deeper than simply verifying a customer’s location, and seeks to offer relevant input. Sporttrade and Xpoint will seek to collaborate in other states following New Jersey, as the former’s offer becomes available across the United States.</p>
