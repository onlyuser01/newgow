    <h1>Aliante Casino Las Vegas Oyo Hotel And Casino Stratosphere Casino Hotel Tower Las Vegas Hard Rock Ca</h1>

<p>Daily fantasy sports (DFS) operator PrizePicks announced three strategic hires, Chris Hackney as Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chip Singh as Executive Creative Director, and Amy Perrault as Senior Vice President of Human Operations ahead of a busy fall.</p>
<p>Support Growth Expectations</p>
<p>As PrizePicks registered real money entry from over 200,000 unique members during the first two weeks of the new season in the NFL, the company appointed the trio to facilitate its expectations of record-breaking user activity and revenue in the fall.</p>
<p>PrizePick chief executive officer Adam Wexler hailed the new appointments as a reflection of the company’s direction alongside its continuous efforts to diversify the platform, expand its brand equity and increase talent on board.</p>
<p>“The fact that they’re joining us at one of the most exciting times of our year just enhances the momentum,” Wexler added.</p>
<p>New Chief Operating Officer</p>
<p>Industry veteran Hackney brings to the recently named the fastest-growing sports company in the US as part of the Inc. 5000 list of the “Most Successful Private Companies” more than 25 years of experience across SaaS, B2B, B2C, social networks, digital media, and brand marketing.</p>
<p>His most recent role was as COO, Product &amp; Customer Success at WebMD, where he spent 4 months leading combined product, customer success and customer service organizations at WebMD Provider Services. This was his second spell with WebMD following five-and-a-half years from 2006 to 2011 as Director, Senior Director and Executive Director, Strategic Development.</p>
<p>Before joining WebMD, Hackney spent 10 months serving as Chief Product Officer at Mercury Healthcare. His career which started as Assistant Vice President at Bank of America in 1997 also includes roles at Cision, TrendKite, Oracle, Vitrue, The Coca-Cola Company, and others.</p>
<p>Commenting on his new appointment, Hackney outlined it would be a “thrilling challenge” to leverage his SaaS scaling experience to a “vibrant sports entertainment platform,” thankful to Wexler for his efforts to “build a world-class team” and eager to become part of the company’s future.</p>
<p>Two Strategic Appointments</p>
<p>New Executive Creative Director Singh will be charged with expanding the company’s brand equity and differentiation in the highly saturated US fantasy sports market. His most recent role was at American Express where he spearheaded creative for the company’s experiential segment across the sports and entertainment sectors.</p>
<p>A former executive with General Electric, Perrault brings more than 20 years of leadership experience in human resources across multiple sectors. Her last role was as an independent consultant with a focus on change management and project management.</p>
