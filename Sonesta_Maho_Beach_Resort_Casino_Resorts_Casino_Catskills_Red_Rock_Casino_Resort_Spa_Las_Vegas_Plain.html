<p>Oddsmakers taking action on the title game aren’t giving the underdog Badgers much of a realistic chance. William Hill and DraftKings have Ohio State spotting Wisconsin 16.5 points. Buckeyes bettors can get a bit better of a deal at Bet365 NJ (16 points), and PointsBet and FanDuel at 15.5 points.</p>
<p>OSU coach Ryan Day isn’t allowing his team to get ahead of themselves.</p>
<p>We absolutely respect these guys,” Day stated. “They’re one of the best-coached teams in America, toughest teams in America.”</p>
<p>The first-year coach continued, “They run the football, they’re very, very well-coached on both sides of the ball, and we were in a dogfight in that game.” Day was referencing his team’s 38-7 win over the Badgers in October.</p>
<p>William Hill has the moneyline with the Buckeyes -900, Badgers +600. A $100 bet on those odds respectively nets a measly $11.11, and $600.</p>
<p>ESPN’s Football Power Index computer simulator gives OSU an 81.6 percent chance at winning, and Wisconsin 18.4 percent. Kickoff for the Big Ten Championship is scheduled for 8:00 pm ET tonight on FOX.</p>
<p>Playoff Berths at Stake</p>
<p>Ohio State has been the considered the first or second top team in the country throughout much of the 2019-20 NCAA football season. The College Football Playoff (CFP) National Championship Selection Committee has put the Buckeyes No. 1 in each of the last two weekly rankings.</p>
<p>Pending an absolute blowout at the hands of the Badgers, the odds are strong the Buckeyes will be afforded a playoff spot regardless of whether they grab the Big Ten Championship.</p>
<p>The FPI gives OSU a 96 percent chance of playing in either the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl or Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on December 28. The computer projects Ohio State will win the National Championship 38 percent of the time.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the computer has Wisconsin’s chances of securing one of the playoff spots at just five percent. Its championship odds are less than one percent.</p>
<p>Bettors Back Buckeyes</p>
<p>Despite the long point spread on OSU-Wisconsin – second longest this weekend only to No. 3 Clemson (12-0) spotting No. 23 Virginia (9-3) 28.5 points – bettors are still going with the favorites.</p>
<p>The percentage of public spread bets on the game are lopsided in Ohio State’s favor. Oddsmakers have additionally printed more tickets on OSU for the point total and moneyline.</p>
<p>Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst is ready for the opportunity to play upset and potentially reach the CFP.</p>
<p>“I certainly think there’s a sense of eagerness or excitement that you’ve done all that you can, and you get a right to play in this game,” Chryst explained.</p>
