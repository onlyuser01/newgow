    <h1>Table Mountain Casino Robinson Rancheria Resort And Casino Online American Casinos Planet Hollywood</h1>

<p>Everi Payments, a wholly owned subsidiary of the manufacturer of gaming equipment Everi Holdings, teamed with Prove Identity for identity verification services, the parent company announced.</p>
<p>Spearheading the Transformation of Gaming</p>
<p>The selection of Prove Identity to become one of the identity service providers for Everi Payments will help the company deliver on all aspects of the mobile gaming ecosystem for its casino operator partners, including funding for gaming devices on-site, payment for point-of-sale machines and a variety of funding access options at casino floors.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement with Prove Identity, Victor Newsom, senior vice president, Product Management, Payment Solutions at Everi, expressed the excitement of the company “to be spearheading the rapid transformation of gaming” in times when the online and on-premise industry channels “continue to merge and complement one another.”</p>
<p>“Consumers are embracing and requesting digital services and virtual wallets within the context of their physical experience,” Newson continued, proud to partner with Prove and convinced that the partnership will “provide an even more seamless experience” across both channels within an environment that enhances safety for users.</p>
<p>Prove’s real-time phone number reputation measurement tool, Trust Score, will facilitate Everi CashClub Wallet users, providing secure customer experiences for digital onboarding, account servicing and ongoing authentication by passively analyzing signals from authoritative sources at the time of transactions to mitigate fraud and account takeover schemes.</p>
<p>Shared Vision of Seamless Payments</p>
<p>Emphasizing the shared vision of “more seamless player transactions that occur both digitally and on-premise,” director of Digital Identity and head of Sports Betting and iGaming at Prove Identity Tom Hill hailed the credentials of Everi as a leading cash access gaming industry provider.</p>
<p>“Everi has been at the forefront of the evolution in payments and digital enablement for gaming,” he continued, thrilled at the opportunity to collaborate with Everi and further strengthen Prove’s position in the sports betting and iGaming verticals.</p>
<p>Utilizing Prove’s solution, Everi will be able to further reduce fraudulent accounts and improve the quality of service throughout the customer lifecycle, as well as gain additional insight into risk via proprietary reason codes.</p>
<p>Everi joins a portfolio of Prove Identity’s customers featuring more than 1,000 global businesses across a wide range of industries, including banks, retailers, cryptocurrency exchanges, healthcare companies, insurance companies, and others, serving their needs for identity verification services as the world moves more and more to a mobile-first economy.</p>
<p>The partnership with Prove Identity comes right after Everi Holdings announced an expansion beyond gaming with the acquisition of Venuetize.</p>
