<p>AffPapa’s upcoming iGaming Club London is still a few weeks away, but interest in the event has remained steady with registrations now surpassing 500.</p>
<p>The gathering, which will bring together operators, B2B companies from the gambling industry worldwide, and affiliate and marketing specialists, is designed to create networking opportunities and encourage collaboration between the top-tier iGaming companies in attendance.</p>
<p>AffPapa, which is proud to connect affiliates with operators, and help them come to mutually-beneficial arrangements, is now even happier to take this same expertise and bring it to real life. Following the success of iGaming Club Amsterdam, AffPapa is confident that the next edition of the event will be even better.</p>
<p>The fact that more than 500 entities have registered to attend the event’s networking dinner is already proof that the company is on the right track with its initiative. iGaming Club London will certainly attract many known faces from the sector, including Campeón Affiliates, AskGamblers, Catena Media, N1 Partners, Betsson Group, and more. All these companies are established entities in the sector, and they will bring their knowledge to the gathering.</p>
<p>Commenting on the registration achievement, AffPapa CEO Levon Nikoghosyan hailed the opportunity to see such a significant number of people in attendance and interested in the event. This, Nikoghosyan said, served as a great testament to the company’s commitment to continue connecting industry members, adding:</p>
<p>"The participation of some of the biggest names in iGaming speaks volumes about how incredible the night will be. iGaming Club promises an exclusive networking dinner, and we are excited to welcome everyone in London to do business."</p>
<p>AffPapa is also hosting the "speed dating" segment of the event, which will essentially seek to acquaint people with one another and help them quickly establish a rapport or explore further business opportunities together. Tickets are already almost sold out, AffPapa informed. Anyone interested in attending iGaming Club London held on February 8 at the De Vere Grand Connaught Rooms in London is welcome to visit the official website and register.</p>
