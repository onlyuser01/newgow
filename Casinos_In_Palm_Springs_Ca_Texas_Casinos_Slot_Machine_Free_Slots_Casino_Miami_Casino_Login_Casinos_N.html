<p>The award-winning iGaming platform and sportsbook solution provider that powers online gambling operators, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), confirmed plans for changes to its senior-level team. On Monday, the company revealed that its Board of Directors agreed for its Group CEO, Richard Brown, to step down.</p>
<p>A statement released by the company reveals that Brown will remain in his current role until December 31, 2023. At the same time, GiG reminded that back in February, its Board started a strategic review that seeks to split the company into two separate corporate groups, namely GiG Media and Platform &amp; Sportsbook.</p>
<p>According to GiG, its GiG Media group will remain with its existing senior leadership. On the other hand, its Platform &amp; Sportsbook corporate group has already started a search for a new CEO, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>Brown commented on the topic by saying that he was excited to be a part of the development of GiG for the last 8 years. Additionally, he acknowledged he was delighted to spearhead the company's efforts as its CEO for the last 4 years. The CEO explained that he helped lead a unique team of seasoned experts which ultimately helped the company grow within the business-to-business vertical.</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that the teams throughout the organization and the management groups of the respective business units have the skills and passion to continue the growth of the business towards its financial and operational targets," said Brown in conclusion.</p>
<p>Petter Nylander, GiG's Chairman of the Board of Directors, acknowledged the success Brown brought to the company. "Richard has done a tremendous job with GiG over the years and the Company is in a very good position driving shareholder value going forward," he said. Finally, Nylander noted: "We are pleased that Richard has agreed to stay until the end of the year to secure a smooth transition."</p>
<p>The confirmation of the planned senior-level change comes after recently, GiG expanded its deal with bet365 for GiG Comply, its leading automated affiliate marketing compliance tool. The two companies had an existing partnership which was expanded and now the operator will benefit further from the leading solution that already powers the operations of global companies around the world.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Jonas Warrer, GiG Media's Chief Marketing Officer, said: "Extending our partnership with bet365, one of the leading names in the industry, is a worthwhile indication of the confidence it provides our partners in the affiliate market and the strength of the team we have in GiG Media."</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in May, GiG confirmed it secured a license from the gambling regulator in Sweden, the Swedish Gaming Authority. This marked an important step for the company as it enabled it to continue to supply its leading services and content to operators in the European country.</p>
