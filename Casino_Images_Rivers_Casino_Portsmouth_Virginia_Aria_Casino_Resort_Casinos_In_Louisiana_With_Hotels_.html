    <h1>Casino Images Rivers Casino Portsmouth Virginia Aria Casino Resort Casinos In Louisiana With Hotels</h1>

<p>I have never seen a casino send a message that the money has been transferred to me and then the money doesn't arrive.</p>
<p>I gave my bank details to the casino a few days ago because they claimed that the money will be with me much faster then. That's the only reason I gave out my bank details.</p>
<p>The chat doesn't give me any helpful answers and the finance department wrote me a meaningless email that is very dubious:</p>
<p>"Hi client!</p>
<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>We apologize for such a long wait, thank you for providing the information for the refund. We are now waiting for a response from the payment provider to provide you with a final response.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>GamaCasino team."</p>
<p>What does that mean please? Gama Casino transfers the money to their active players within 24 hours. In my case, why are they pretending to need supernatural abilities to get my money transferred?</p>
<p>Once again Gama has not kept the promise and now the weekend is coming when once again nothing will happen.</p>
<p>What's so difficult about making a transfer? Gama is using stalling tactics here and I feel so screwed.</p>
<p>You casino guru know how it feels to be stalled over and over again with completely dubious excuses and empty promises?</p>
<p>Please Casino Guru, surely you are in contact with a manager or an affiliate manager through your cooperation with Gama. Can you please find a conversation there and make sure that my money is finally transferred.</p>
<p>I really need the money urgently and I was already counting on the money when Gama emailed me that the money had been transferred to me. Something is wrong here and therefore I ask you to get in touch with your contacts at Gama.</p>
<p>All I want is for the money to finally arrive in my account. I don't want to read any more excuses. All other players also get their money paid out immediately at Gama.</p>
<p>I mean, it's incredibly cheeky to claim that the money went to my Neteller and then no money ever gets to me. And it wasn't until I showed the email from Neteller that the casino was lying that Gama claimed there might be some problem. what problem? How is that possible?</p>
<p>The chat then promised me that I would get my money IMMEDIATELY if I gave the bank details. And now the game starts all over again and I wait for the money day after day, but nothing happens. Yes, it hasn't even been transferred yet and only hear excuses that it's being worked on.</p>
<p>What should be worked on here, please, it is just a simple transfer and it takes 1 minute to make it.</p>
<p>Please Casino Guru, get in touch with your contact at Gama directly. Please.</p>
