<p>Ongoing challenges and past setbacks mean fans in the Tarheel State will miss the opportunity to wager online on the year’s premiere sporting event</p>
<p>Prospective bettors in North Carolina eagerly awaiting the launch of legal mobile sports betting will have to wait beyond the Super Bowl, confirmed Ripley Rand, Chair of the North Carolina State Lottery Commission (NCSLC). Several pending tasks are still in progress before the state can allow mobile wagers, delaying the anticipated launch.</p>
<p>Expectations Are at an All-Time High</p>
<p>North Carolina’s sports betting law initially set 8 January 2024 as the launch date for online sports betting. The NCSLC has been actively working on regulatory preparations since then, marking steady progress despite setbacks. While regulatory proposals were published on 7 November and approved on 16 November, raising hopes for a launch around the Super Bowl, recent updates indicate such a timeline will be unfeasible.</p>
<p>Ripley Rand recently posted an update clarifying that the NCSLC could not guarantee a launch ahead of the Super Bowl. This statement was disappointing, as industry experts pointed out the state would lose significant revenues by not capitalizing on the year’s premiere sporting event. However, a problematic launch could be even more damaging, explaining the North Carolina authorities’ cautious approach.</p>
<p>It’s clear, however, with all the work remaining and the timetable set out in state law, (a Super Bowl launch) unfortunately won’t be the case. Ripley Rand, NCSLC Chair</p>
<p>Fan anticipation has not subsided despite the NCSLC’s efforts to reign in fan and stakeholder expectations. November saw state authorities confirm that sports betting would not be available until mid-2024, but the apparent rapid progress once again raised hopes of an earlier launch. However, legalizing online wagering remains challenging, and the NCSLC prefers to take its time and get everything right.</p>
<p>The NCSLC Remains on Track with Its Progress</p>
<p>North Carolina remains highly attractive for operators as many high-profile companies like DraftKings, Caesars, bet365, BetMGM, and FanDuel prepare to enter the Tarheel State. Currently, physical sports wagering is accessible at three sportsbooks situated on tribal land. However, the sports betting law passed in June 2023 paved the way for 12 online operators.</p>
<p>The NCSLC has recorded substantial progress and is now accepting sports wagering applications. Sportsbooks eyeing operations in North Carolina must apply for one of the 12 state-allocated licenses by 27 December. The Commission will review the candidates within 60 days, signaling that a launch won’t happen earlier than March. Successful applicants must pay a $1 million licensing fee and an 18% tax on generated revenues.</p>
<p>Despite rising pressures, the NCSLC Sports Betting Committee will press on with its meetings and consultations, remaining committed to ensuring a successful and appropriate launch as soon as feasible within the regulatory guidelines set forth by the law. While missing out on the Super Bowl is disappointing, North Carolina is still on track to become a prosperous and sustainable online wagering jurisdiction.</p>
