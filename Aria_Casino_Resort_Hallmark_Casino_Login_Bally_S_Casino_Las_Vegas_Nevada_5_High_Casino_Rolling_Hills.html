<p>Joan of Arc review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc</p>
<p>As she came riding through the dark;</p>
<p>No moon to keep her armour bright,</p>
<p>No man to get her through this very smoky night.</p>
<p>She said, ‘I'm tired of the war,</p>
<p>I want the kind of work I had before.’ – Joan of Arc, by Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p>She may not have the kind of work she had before, or indeed the kind of work she had after her death when she was canonised as a Saint of the Catholic Church. Where she once served as a military advisor and leader to the French during the Hundred Years War now, in GameArt’s Joan of Arc slot machine, she is representing the treasury.</p>
<p>You’ll need to land her symbol if you want the biggest rewards the game has to offer.</p>
<p>Winning combination with Wild symbol</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The medieval setting is rendered pleasantly with a field of battle in the background and chainmail backgrounds on some of the symbols. The artwork is well rendered and coupled with solid reel and win animations to make the whole thing visually appealing.</p>
<p>The music too is pitched just right, setting the mood and in keeping with the theme, but not so invasive as to become annoying as it loops around and around.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Despite being a five reel slot with 243 winlines the gameplay is relatively slow, with wins coming in fairly rarely. The real excitement comes along during the bonus rounds which are described in greater detail below.</p>
<p>There is a gamble feature if you want to raise your volatility and add in a little variation to your game as well.</p>
<p>Hitting 3 Scatter symbols awards 10 free spins</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are two main bonus features. The first is triggered by the Scatter symbol when you hit three or more in a go. As well as receiving a payout for hitting the Scatter symbol you also receive ten free spins.</p>
<p>The second bonus feature involves the ‘Arrow Border’ symbols. These are like the regular symbols but have a changed background and border. When these Arrow Symbols are part of a winning combination they then expand to fill the reel they are in. The expansion splits each symbol so that for the purpose of counting winning combos the original symbol remains in play with the expanded symbol next to it (see image below).</p>
<p>Arrow border symbols can expand in order to raise your winnings</p>
<p>During the free spins, any Arrow Border symbol expands regardless of whether it is part of a winning combo.</p>
<p>The game also has a Wild symbol which plays as any symbol except for the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>With its RTP unpublished, it is hard to decide if this game is worth your time or not on the basis of the vig. Caution would dictate avoiding any slot that is unwilling to publish its basic statistics like this.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc slot offers a gamble function (if you turn it on)</p>
<p>The game has medium volatility, which doesn’t lend itself very well to our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>On the site, we tested the minimum bet was €/£/$0.30 per spin and the maximum was €/£/$150.00 per spin. This should cover all but the smallest of bankrolls.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc - full paytable</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Although visually pleasant and well made, Joan of Arc suffers from two major setbacks.</p>
<p>The first main problem is that it has poor or absent statistics: the RTP is unpublished and the variance is very middle of the road.</p>
<p>The second is that the gameplay is somewhat uninspired, with only the most basic features to back the visuals up.</p>
<p>We do not recommend this game.</p>
