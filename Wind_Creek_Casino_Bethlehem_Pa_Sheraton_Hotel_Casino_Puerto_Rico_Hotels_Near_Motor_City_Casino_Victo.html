<p>The UK's leading pool betting operator with a lengthy history, UK Tote Group, announced a senior-level appointment, strengthening its team in an effort to continue growing its domestic and international presence. The company confirmed Wednesday that the changes to its C-suite seek to contribute toward the execution of its growth strategy, applicable to its international business-to-business (B2B) operations, as well as its UK business operations.</p>
<p>As a result, UK Tote Group confirmed it hired the services of Dave Hammond, a proven leader within the industry with decades of experience. Joining the company, he was selected as Chief Commercial Officer (UK). Currently, Hammond has ties with different racing syndicates and at the same time, he owns five national hunt horses in Ireland.</p>
<p>Besides Hammond's appointment, UK Tote Group confirmed that Jon Knapman was appointed to the role of Chief Commercial Officer (International). In his new role with the company, Knapman will be in charge of the company's commercial performance and help it grow its B2B International business. This move comes as no surprise, considering the UK Tote Group's expansion in the US, Hong Kong and South Africa over the last few years.</p>
<p>In a statement released on April 26, 2023, UK Tote Group's Chief Executive, Alex Frost, welcomed Hammond to the company's growing team of experts. He explained: "As we continue to execute our growth strategy for the business and following three years of significant expansion within international markets with many more opportunities on the horizon, we now have two extremely strong leaders focused on driving the commercial performance of our International and UK businesses."</p>
<p>Hammond was similarly excited to join the UK Tote Group. "I am excited to be joining the Tote and working alongside Alex, Jon and the wider team as we continue to grow the Tote within the UK market," he said. Finally, Hammond explained: "I have watched with interest as the team has revitalized the Tote over the last few years and hope my experience from a number of different roles across the industry will positively support the next phase of the Toteâ€™s growth cycle."</p>
<p>To his new role, Hammond brings significant leadership-level experience. Overall, he was a part of the gaming sector for more than 25 years. Throughout his professional career, he was a part of leading globally recognized brands.</p>
<p>Hammond held senior operational roles with gaming industry giants Betfair, Inspired Gaming, as well as Paddy Power. His professional background includes a COO role with SBTech. Before joining the UK Tote Group, Hammond served as SVP for DraftKings, the famous American daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting company.</p>
