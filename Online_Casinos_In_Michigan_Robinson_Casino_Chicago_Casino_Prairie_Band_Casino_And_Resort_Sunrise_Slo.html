<p>The Las Vegas Strip doesn’t stop for much, including sleep. Its casinos, shops, bars, restaurants, and (most of its) attractions don’t even close for Christmas. But the Strip does celebrate the holidays in spectacular style, with many resorts going further than just decking their gambling halls with giant trees and blinking lights. Here’s our guide to the most wonderful ways to celebrate the season, Vegas style, going in order from south to north on the Strip.</p>
