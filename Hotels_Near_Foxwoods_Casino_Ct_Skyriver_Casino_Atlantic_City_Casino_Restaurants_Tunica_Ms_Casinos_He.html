<p>After suffering their fifth loss of the season last weekend, the Las Vegas Raiders now only have a 14% chance to make the playoffs. The chance of their next opponent, the Jacksonville Jaguars, is even worse – it’s only 5%.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean that these two have given up on their dreams before the half point of the 2022 NFL season. On the contrary, both are expected to switch up a gear and pray that their competitors will fail.</p>

<p>The Raiders are Much Better Than What Their 2022 Record Suggests</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Raiders are 2-5 in the 2022 NFL season, which sounds terrible, but the truth is that they haven’t been that bad. It’s just that their schedule has been horrible so far. Excluding the 24-0 blowout loss to the New Orleans Saints last weekend, all of their defeats were more or less expected.</p>
<p>They lost to the Kansas City Chiefs on the road by just one point, as well as to the Tennessee Titans by two points. The Raiders also suffered an away loss to the Los Angeles Chargers who beat them by five points. Their only home loss of 2022 happened against the Arizona Cardinals, who won by a touchdown.</p>
<p>When it comes to their 2022 wins, the Raiders triumphed against the Denver Broncos and the Houston Texans. Both of those wins happened in Nevada, while they’re still without a single win on the road in the 2022 season.</p>
<p>The Jaguars are 0-5 Since September</p>
<p>The Jags started the season in top gear, winning two of their first three games of 2022. But then, they entered a losing streak, with five straight defeats.</p>
<p>The worst thing is that in those games, they played against teams that aren’t much better (if all) than their next opponent. For example, they lost to the Texans in Week 5, and the Colts in Week 6.</p>
<p>They also failed to beat the struggling Broncos last weekend, in a game played in London’s biggest stadium, Wembley. The Brits didn’t get to enjoy a spectacle that evening, with Denver winning 21-17.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Raiders vs Jacksonville Jaguars Week 9 Prediction</p>
<p>The Raiders have so much talent in the offense – Derek Carr (QB), Davante Adams (WR), Darren Waller (TE), and others – that they should have no problems outplaying the Jaguars defense. But what about the other way around?</p>
<p>Led by second-year QB Trevor Lawrence, the Jaguars have shown glimpses of pure class in a couple of games this season. The trouble is that it happened weeks ago. In recent times, they just don’t look very sharp.</p>
<p>Picks: Las Vegas Raiders to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
