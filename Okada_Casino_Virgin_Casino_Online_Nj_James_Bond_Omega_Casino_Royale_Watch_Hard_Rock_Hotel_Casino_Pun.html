<p>The Cabinet of President Donald Trump is starting to become more of a Lazy Susan, as members of the executive branch advisory board continue to rotate.</p>

<p>This week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson became the latest high ranking official to be shown the door. Fourth in line for the presidency, Trump announced the news via Twitter where he explained that Mike Pompeo, current director for the CIA, will assume the position.</p>
<p>“He will do a fantastic job!” the president said of Pompeo as secretary of state. “Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!”</p>
<p>Trump confirmed that Gina Haspel will become the next CIA director, the first female to lead the country’s foreign intelligence agency.</p>
<p>Online bettors at the political prediction site PredictIt.org saw Tillerson’s ousting coming. In the market asking, “Which of these members of Trump’s Cabinet will leave next?” the state secretary was the favorite.</p>
<p>Shares of Tillerson were trading for as high as 65 cents in December. But after rumors began circulating that Attorney General Jeff Sessions might be on his way out, the secretary of state’s price dropped.</p>
<p>However, Tillerson was still the favorite earlier this week at 15 cents. Sessions was next at 12 cents, followed by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson (nine cents) and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao (three cents).</p>
<p>After Trump’s tweet, Tillerson shares are now trading at 99 cents. Once he’s formally relieved of his duties, which as of today isn’t precisely clear, each PredictIt Tillerson share will be paid $1.</p>
<p>Confirmation Timeline</p>
<p>Before Mike Pompeo can begin traveling the world serving as secretary of state, the CIA chief will be scrutinized by the Senate for confirmation. It will be no quick process, according to PredictIt bettors.</p>
<p>The market “Who will be Senate-confirmed Secretary of State on March 31, 2018?” has Pompeo at just three cents. T</p>
<p>With the president readying to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, having a State Department at full strength might be wise. “Will Trump meet with Kim Jong Un in 2018?” is currently on PredictIt at Yes, 56 cents.</p>
<p>Cabinet Hailing Cabs</p>
<p>Rex Tillerson joins an ever-growing list of people who are no longer serving Donald Trump’s administration.</p>
<p>Secretary of Labor: Andrew Puzder was appointed by Trump to the position, but never confirmed. Alex Acosta was later nominated and confirmed by the Senate. Secretary of Homeland Security: After John Kelly resigned to become Trump’s chief of staff, Kirstjen Nielsen became Homeland Security secretary in December. Secretary of HHS: After accusations arose last fall over his use of private charters and military aircraft, Tom Price resigned in September. Alex Azar became Health and Human Services secretary in January.</p>
<p>In addition to the Cabinet members, there’s a massive list of individuals who have advised the president who are no longer employed with the White House.</p>
<p>Gary Cohn recently left as the National Economic Council director, former Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was fired in August, Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci was terminated in July, and FBI Director James Comey was let go in May.</p>
<p>Trump is also on his second White House press secretary, with Sarah Huckabee Sanders replacing Sean Spicer last July. Kelly took over as chief of staff that same month, after former RNC Chairman Reince Priebus resigned after serving the shortest tenure ever in the role.</p>
