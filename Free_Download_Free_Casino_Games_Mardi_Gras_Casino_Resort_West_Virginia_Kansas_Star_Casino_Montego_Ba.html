<p>OlyBet and GGPoker are partners as of last Thursday. OlyBet users can now access the WSOP Super Circuit Online Series.</p>
<p>OlyBet and GGPoker</p>
<p>OlyBet successfully partnered up with GGPoker last Thursday, April 30. While OlyBet’s previous network, the Microgaming Poker Network (MPN), is due to close later this month, OlyBet has already launched all of GGPoker’s markets as a part of the transition. Under the agreement, The Olympic Entertainment Group (OlyBet) will receive an average daily flow of some 30,000 players. By making this move, OlyBet has joined one of the world’s major online poker network.</p>
<p>But what led to this, one might ask? The Estonian OlyBet offers casino games, virtual sports and live casino, although the company is mainly a sports betting brand. OlyBet’ first poker product was released on MPN in 2013. After a few good years, last September MPN said that the network will be shut down in May 2020. In their announcement Microgaming said: “we had to adopt a very different strategy and business model. Ultimately, the poker network is not part of that vision“.</p>
<p>OlyBet Users to Enjoy More Benefits</p>
<p>Now that OlyBet has partnered up with GGPoker, users will be able to access the WSOP Super Circuit Online Series. This is essentially a poker tournament, organized by the World Series of Poker (WSOP) and the GGPoker network. The tournament started on Sunday, May 3 and it run through May 31. All of OlyBet’s users will be able to participate in the tournament.</p>
<p>The WSOP Super Circuit Online Series is actually the world’s highest paying online poker tournament with more than $100 million guaranteed prize money. It features 18 gold ring tournaments and a staggering number of 595 events. Depending on the events that players choose to participate in, the buy-in can be as little as $50 or even up to $25,000 for the High Roller Championship which features a prize purse of $10 million.</p>
<p>Insight on the GGPoker Network</p>
<p>GGPoker also known as GGNetwork (Good Game Network) was started in 2014. Back in the day, the provider’s goal was to “make poker fun again”. The main focus for the company back then was the South East Asian and Chinese market. Later on, in 2016-2017 operators from Canada and Europe joined the GGNetwork.</p>
<p>In 2019, the GGNetwork is touted as the biggest poker network in the world. One of the network’s iconic tournaments is last year’s GGSeries 3 online poker tournament, where a guaranteed total prize of $50 million was for the taking. While no specific details were released by OlyBet or GGPoker as to what led to the current partnership, this will prove to be beneficial for the two gaming giants.</p>
<p>Today, the platform has a team of ambassadors, including Bryn Kenney, BertrandGrospellier and Daniel Negreanu himself. In fact, just today, GGPoker secured a new ambassador, Fedor Holz as part of a new deal with Pokercode.</p>
