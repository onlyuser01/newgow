    <h1>Free Casino Slot Machines Colorado Casino Resorts Virgin Casino Online Nj Directions To Pechanga Cas</h1>

<p>Things are heating up in the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series with just six events left on the calendar before the playoffs kick off. The next race on the schedule is the 2023 Highpoint.com 400 at Pocono Raceway, which is on the program on Sunday, July 23</p>
<p>It’s been an interesting summer in NASCAR with some really strange results over the last couple of weeks. Martin Truex Jr. is the one who won the rain-delayed race on Monday, thus putting an end to a sort of disappointing run with finishes in 29th and 32nd place in the two races prior.</p>
<p>The No 1 in the NASCAR Drivers’ Championship won the race, but those from the No. 2 to the No. 7 place all had a horrible day. Excluding Denny Hamlin, they all finished outside the top 10. Will they do better this time?</p>
<p>The NASCAR odds sure suggest so, with all of the drivers from the top portion of the table seen as decent contenders to win the 2023 Highpoint.com 400 at Pocono.</p>

<p>Martin Truex Jr. Needs to be Taken Seriously (Again)</p>
<p>After two disappointing finishes, Martin Truex Jr. got himself on the podium again. He won Crayon 301 on Monday, which was his third win in the last three months. The result is that he remains top of the NASCAR Drivers’ championship standings.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers are confident he’s going to continue to drive well, the evidence being that he’s seen as one of the co-shared for the Pocono race.</p>
<p>Sure, he’s never won the HighPoint.com 400 race, but he’s won in other events held at the Pocono. Pocono Organics CBD 325 in 2015 and 2018.</p>
<p>Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch Just Love “The Tricky Triangle”</p>
<p>Martin Truex Jr. is one of the three drivers with the shortest Pokomo odds. The other two are Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch, who absolutely love this racecourse. Last year, it was Chase Elliott who won the race, but it happened after Hamlin and Busch – who finished in first and second place, respectively – got disqualified for illegal modifications to their cars.</p>
<p>A year before, Kyle Busch won the race, which was the third time he won this event. On top of that, he also has one win on the other event that used to take place on this course, the Pocono Organics CBD 325.</p>
<p>Still, the man who loves “The Tricky Triangle” the most is Denny Hamlin. With four wins in the 2023 Highpoint.com 400, and two Pocono Organics CBD 325 victories, it’s no surprise that he’s seen as one of the top three favorites.</p>
<p>2023 Highpoint.com 400 Pocono Prediction</p>
<p>Denny Hamlin has won just one race this season, which happened back in May in Kansas. However, he’s been working hard lately, and his performances have improved significantly. We think the time’s come for the 42-year-old to record another triumph.</p>
<p>Pick: Denny Hamlin to win</p>
