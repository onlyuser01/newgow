<p>Manchester City’s No. 1 Goal is the Champions League</p>
<p>The Cityzens are sitting top of the table in the Premier League, and with just a few more rounds left to be played, it’s very likely they’re going to retain the domestic title. They also got a very chance to win the FA Cup, where they’ve reached the final and will play their city rivals, United, in early July at Wembley.</p>
<p>Still, neither of those competitions is as important to them as the UEFA Champions League. Not only is this the holy grail of club soccer, but this is also a trophy they still haven’t won. It’s actually very strange that Pep Guardiola’s men are without a single UCL trophy in their collection because they were the No. 1 favorite to win it each of the last couple of seasons.</p>
<p>The same is the case this year, but they need to be extra careful as their opponent in the semifinal is Real Madrid. This team knocked them out in the semis last season even though Man City had a decent lead coming into Game 2.</p>
<p>Can Real Madrid Stage Another Upset?</p>
<p>The reigning UCL champions travel to Manchester to try and do the impossible. They need to beat Manchester City on Wednesday. It doesn’t matter how they do it – in regulation, extra time, or penalties – the only thing that matters is that they win.</p>
<p>The trouble is that Los Blancos just do not look capable of pulling it off. In Game 1, they were the worse side and if it weren’t for Vini Junior’s brilliant performance, they would have lost the game. The visiting team was the dominant force that evening, but they just failed to get on target more than once.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that is that Los Blancos did a fine job taming Erling Haaland. There’s a big question mark, however, over whether they can do the same again.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Real Madrid Prediction</p>
<p>It’s now or never for Manchester City. The Cityzens haven’t looked this strong ever, and they’ve won all sorts of things in England. Now is the time to take that big leap forward and the first thing they need to do is beat Real Madrid on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
