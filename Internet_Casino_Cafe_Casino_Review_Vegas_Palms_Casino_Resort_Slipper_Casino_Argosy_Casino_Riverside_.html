<p>One of the hottest gambling industry events is returning to sunny Barcelona this September, with the gathering reuniting thousands of delegates across five dedicated zones which will allow attendees and industry stakeholders to navigate the floor and event with ease.</p>
<p>Hosted out of the Fira Barcelona Montju√Øc on September 19-21, SBC Summit Barcelona 2023 offers visitors the opportunity to catch themselves up on the latest trends in the iGaming and sports betting industries. The dedicated floors will focus on five main areas of the industry, and specifically</p>
<p>Sports Betting</p>
<p>Casino &amp; iGaming</p>
<p>Payments &amp; Compliance</p>
<p>Affiliate, Marketing &amp; Media</p>
<p>Emerging Tech, Blockchain and Metaverse</p>
<p>These five zones will make getting the most out of the event much easier and allow delegates to visit those particular panels that they are the most interested in or relevant to their own businesses. The event will have 450 industry professionals lined up as speakers and 300 exhibitors on 38,000 square meters of space, making for a dynamic and action-packed event indeed.</p>
<p>SBC Events is excited about the upcoming conference as it is expected to welcome 10,000 delegates, 3,000 operators, and 1,200 affiliates. By and large, this is the biggest opportunity to network, catch yourself up on the latest developments in the gambling industry and collaborate.</p>
<p>The speakers who will be attending feature many prominent figures from the industry, and the people who have virtually helped shape it over the years. Some of the confirmed speakers who will be attending include Flutter Entertainment CEO International Daniel Taylor, Betsson Group CEO Operations Jesper Svensson, Danske Spil CEO Karsten Fogh Holanng, LeoVegas Group CEO &amp; Co-Founder Gustaf Hagman and many others.</p>
<p>Other heavyweight speakers include Snaitech S.p.A. CEO Fabio Schiavolin, Svenska Spel Sports &amp; Casino CEO Fredrik Wastenson, and LiveScore Group CEO Sam Sadi. These speakers, along with hundreds of others, represent the global elite in the industry. They come from all walks of it, too, including the private sector, government agencies, responsible gambling advocates, legal experts, and tech innovators.</p>
<p>The full agenda of the event is also already out for both Wednesday, September 20 and Thursday, September 21. Tuesday, September 19 will be a customary welcome day during which people get to break into the event and get all set up.</p>
