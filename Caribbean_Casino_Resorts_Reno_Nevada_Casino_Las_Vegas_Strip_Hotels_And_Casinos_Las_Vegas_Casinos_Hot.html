    <h1>Caribbean Casino Resorts Reno Nevada Casino Las Vegas Strip Hotels And Casinos Las Vegas Casinos Hot</h1>

<p>N1 Casino has closed my account for the following reasons:</p>
<p>"λυπούμαστε, αλλά έχετε παραβιάσει τους Όρους &amp; Προϋποθέσεις μας, καθώς έχετε δημιουργήσει διπλότυπο λογαριασμό."</p>
<p>Translated into English this means that I opened a duplicate account thus violating the terms of N1 policy. I am not contesting the account closure, as my accounts were previously closed due to self-exclusion, I am protesting the fact that N1 casino allowed me to desposit funds and register again.</p>
<p>This is not the case as I should not have had any N1 accounts. I self-excluded myself for life in 2023.</p>
<p>On January 3rd, 2024 I registered for a new account with N1 and mentioned my Government ID number, which remains unchanged. During the registration process, I provided N1 with an accurate date of birth, which remains unchanged, and registered with the same name that I registered with before. I do this to ensure that institutions maintain my ban.</p>
<p>The question remains. How did N1 casino allow me to register and why did it accept two deposits from me, one for 550 euros and the other for 250 euros, despite supposedly being banned? The reason I banned myself is so that N1 doesn't accept any deposits from me. I am a problem gambler, and I need help controlling my addiction. N1 failed miserably in this regard.</p>
<p>On January 4th, 2024 I withdrew the 630 euro that remained in my account. This represents a 170 euro loss, not a gain, as I had deposited 800 euros in funds N1 should not have accepted.</p>
<p>On January 4th, 2024 N1 Casino sent me an e-mail concerning this withdrawal and account closure claiming the following:</p>
<p>"Σύμφωνα με την απόφαση της Διοίκησης, ο διπλότυπος λογαριασμός σας έκλεισε και όλα τα κέρδη κατασχέθηκαν."</p>
<p>Translated into English, this means that my "winnings" were being confiscated, even though I had no winnings as I lost 170 euros.</p>
<p>In the same e-mail thread on January 4th, N1 stated:</p>
<p>"Προκειμένου να επεξεργαστούμε την επιστροφή της τελευταίας σας κατάθεσης"</p>
<p>Translated into English this means that N1 casino is only re-reimbursing my last deposit of 250 euro, despite allowing me to deposit 800 euro while being banned. My current account balance in N1 casino is 630 euros.</p>
<p>Because of the severity of the situation I chose to respond to N1 in English, despite being educated and fluent in 3 languages, English, Greek, and French. However, my English is at 100% and my Greek is at 90% so I always choose to respond to such complex issues in English as my Greek writing skills are limited to my mobile, as my laptop has no Greek keyboard and no Greek spell-checker that can be easily used. I am responding now on my laptop proving as well that my quotes are being copied and pasted directly from N1 e-mails.</p>
<p>During my support chat call, the agent proclaimed that I must not understand Greek and that N1 did not tell me that the reason for the account closure is "λυπούμαστε, αλλά έχετε παραβιάσει τους Όρους &amp; Προϋποθέσεις μας, καθώς έχετε δημιουργήσει διπλότυπο λογαριασμό." (I.e I opened a duplicate account despite having no N1 accounts open due to a self-exclusion). That's a typical racist trope in Greece that immigrants who are Greek citizens like myself hear all the time when native Greeks do something wrong to cover up for themselves as if I don't speak Greek, I merely have difficulty writing in the language. It's a very difficult language to write, but I understand it perfectly having gone to school for 6 years in my Youth to learn it.</p>
<p>As a result of this support chat, N1 sent me several English responses to my account closure claiming that:</p>
<p>"Your account has been closed due to a violation of the Terms and Conditions." Notice that they omitted their original reason that my account was closed because I registered a duplicate account. They also reaffirmed that they are only returning my last deposit, which is 250 euros, despite having deposited 800 euros in total which N1 should have not accepted due to being banned.</p>
<p>I want my deposit of 800 euros returned to me plus 1400 euros for the trouble N1 gave me. N1 should never have accepted these deposits. This is a total of 2200 euros that I would like deposited within 24 hours to a bank account of my choosing. I already gave N1 Casino the information on this account. This amount is far less than any court will give me for N1's violation of their commitment to problem gamblers. I also want N1 to commit to making the necessary changes to enforce self-exclusion within 90 days, to maintain confidentiality in our communication, and not distribute the communication to anyone.</p>
<p>I purposely register and try to deposit money to each casino in Greece that I have banned myself from to ensure that they comply. N1 failed miserably and accepted my deposit immediately. Most other casinos pass my test and enforce the ban. There are only a dozen or so legal online casinos in Greece and I have excluded myself from all of them.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
