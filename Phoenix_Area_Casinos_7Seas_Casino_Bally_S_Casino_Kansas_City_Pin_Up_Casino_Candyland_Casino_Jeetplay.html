<p>Dear Tenzin,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem, but please understand that casino don’t accept deposits from 3rd parties. By registering an account, you agree to terms and conditions of the casino. In this specific case there is written:</p>

You will not use the Services for any outlaw, 3rd party or fraudulent activity, or for any unlawful or fraudulent transaction (including money laundering), in accordance with the laws of all the jurisdictions of the country having authority over you. To clarify, you attest that you may not use funds from 3rd parties, other than from your own financial accounts.

<p>Please understand, that by depositing from your sister’s credit card you have breached one of the main rules. Casino voided your winnings for this reason and I’m afraid it is an irreversible process. If there is anything else, I could help you with, please do not hesitate to contact me, otherwise, I will be forced to reject this complaint as unjustified. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
