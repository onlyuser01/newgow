    <h1>Morongo Casino Resort Spa Seminole Drive Cabazon Ca Slotocash Casino Login Twinspires Casino Casinos</h1>

<p>Good Morning Petronela, hope your doing well.</p>
<p>I feel like i need to point out the elephant in the room and make it clear that i understand i wont be getting my money i won from superslots, nor will i be compensated in any way. Superslots has been dishonest from the get go and hipocrites who have failed to show any proof that my findings are untrue. Its been 10 days, plenty of time to make up a story to back whatever fairytale they want to impose on me and reality.</p>
<p>With that said im going to release a truth i was holding back as i didnt wanna show all my cards, however this doesnt effecf the case one bit, other then making superslots loom even worse. The money i had won was quickly lost at other slots.</p>
<p>How this effects me is simple. Superslots advertises a weekly 10% rebate for anyons who loses $1,000 plus in a given 4 day period, Monday - Thursday. %10 of $5,600 = $560 however its a cap of $250.</p>
<p>I wont recieve nor will i ever recieve that $250. Ive laid out all evidense to superslots none.</p>
<p>I do apologize for hding information back, my reasoning was honest, i wanted to see if they responded, if they would have brought up that i had lost it according thier account history which would backfire and catch themselves in a lie. Unfortuantly i dont see this going anywhere, but there rating derserves a steep drop, im talking steep. No legitimate site would not consider pictures and screenshots with exact date and time matching when the player says they won a certain amount of money. Superslots dossnt even consider it evidence. Yet i cant loom at my own account history, let alone have them send me my accouny history in 24 hours, btw thier own Admission which fell through.</p>
<p>In a couple more months, maybe 6 months, online reputable casinos here in the states will start popping up and things like this ans sites like superslots will be a thing of the past. That day coyldnt come any sooner.</p>
