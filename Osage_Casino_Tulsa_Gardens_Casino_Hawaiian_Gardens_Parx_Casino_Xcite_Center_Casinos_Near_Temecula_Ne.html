    <h1>Osage Casino Tulsa Gardens Casino Hawaiian Gardens Parx Casino Xcite Center Casinos Near Temecula Ne</h1>

<p>Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I urgently need your help again. I've been registered at N1 Casino since the beginning of this year and my player account is also fully verified. So ID card data, Skrill account, Paysafecard account and bank statement from my bank, these documents are fully uploaded and accepted by them. I've deposited and withdrawn many times. 2 days ago I deposited 80 euros with Skrill and wanted to withdraw 130 euros. The withdrawal was declined saying I should send documents proving where the funds I deposit to the casino come from.</p>
<p>Here is the exact text: In order to additionally verify your account, we ask you to upload the following documents to your profile (Documents tab):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a document (or set of documents) showing where the funds used to make deposits to our casino come from, e.g. E.g. a payslip, proof of ownership of a business, sale of a property, inheritance payment or divorce settlement, etc. (for the last 6 months)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A detailed bank statement in PDF format showing that this income (the origin of the funds) has been credited to your bank account in the last 6 months or more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and your patience!</p>
<p>So if I understand that correctly, they want to see my income or bank statements for a whole six months?</p>
<p>I'm totally unsure now, especially since this is sensitive data that they want. So can you help me before I upload miles of my bank statements to them? Is what is being asked of me permissible at all? I think I'll send a current bank statement first and not 6 in the hope that the payout will be processed?</p>
<p>Please urgently for help. It's only about 130 euros, so I don't understand the casino's approach.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reply.</p>
<p>Annette</p>
