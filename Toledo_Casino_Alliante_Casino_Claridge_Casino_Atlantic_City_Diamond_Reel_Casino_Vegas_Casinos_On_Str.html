    <h1>Toledo Casino Alliante Casino Claridge Casino Atlantic City Diamond Reel Casino Vegas Casinos On Str</h1>

<p>Dear Claudia,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gaming section on the website, and this is what I found https://www.boocasino.com/en/responsible-gaming-policy:</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>You may choose to exclude yourself from our site for a longer period of time, including an unlimited exclusion.</p>
<p>Once the Self-Exclusion period ends, your account will automatically be reactivated and you will then be able to access your account. You may request for a Self-Exclusion to be removed prior to it’s expiry, however the 7 day cooling-off period will apply. The account will be re-activated on the original expiry date or after the 7 day cooling off period, whichever is the earliest.</p>
<p>If you do exclude yourself from our site, you will be removed from all marketing communications for the period that you are excluded. (Please note that it may take up to 48 hours for all our marketing databases to be updated.)"</p>
<p>I would strongly recommend sending an email including all the relevant information to support@boocasino.com. In this way, you’ll have proof of such an action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
