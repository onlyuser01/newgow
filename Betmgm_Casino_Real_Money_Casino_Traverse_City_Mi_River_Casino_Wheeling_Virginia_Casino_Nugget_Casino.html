<p>The talented jockey said that he recognizes the huge importance of pool betting to the success of racing in mature markets</p>
<p>UK Tote Group has welcomed the leading flat jockey Tom Marquand as an ambassador. In this position, the racing star will talk about his life and what being at the forefront of racing is like.</p>
<p>In addition to talking about his past victories, Marquand will also share his thoughts on the races he will participate in this summer. These will notably include races in the UK and Irelands’ 18 World Pool days.</p>
<p>Marquand is a 25-year-old jockey who has ridden nearly 1,000 winners in the United Kingdom and beyond. He has had multiple successful races in Australia and Hong Kong, with his winners including 10 Group 1s in four different countries.</p>
<p>Some of Marquand’s most notable victories include wins at the St Leger at Doncaster on Galileo Chrome and three Queen Elizabeth Stakes victories in Australia on Addeybb (twice) and Dubai Honour. The talented jockey also finished joint second during the 2022 British Flat Jockeys Championship with his wife Hollie Doyle.</p>
<p>As an ambassador, Marquand will join Danny Mullins who has been working with the company since 2021. Mullins has already participated in various activations, including two in-depth short films titled The Journey to Cheltenham.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Tote will continue working with the Hong Kong Jockey Club and racecourse partners to highlight important betting opportunities created by World Pool. The company will showcase huge pools that ensure excellent value to bettors.</p>
<p>Marquand Recognizes the Importance of Pool Betting</p>
<p>Addressing his new ambassadorial role, Marquand said:</p>
<p>I am thrilled to be teaming up with the Tote team as an ambassador to provide an exclusive insight into life as a flat jockey. I loved watching the content that the Tote filmed with Danny Mullins and I am excited to get going with the team as the flat season starts to take shape with the Derby and Royal Ascot just around the corner. Tom Marquand, ambassador, UK Tote Group</p>
<p>As someone who was participated in races all over the world, Marquand realizes the importance of pool betting to racing’s financial ecosystem. Because of that, he is looking forward to supporting the Tote team and helping it solidify itself as a pool betting leader in the UK.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alex Frost, the Tote’s chief executive officer, said that the company is excited to welcome the young jockey as an ambassador. According to Frost, Marquand will be able to engage racing fans by sharing his earnest thoughts on the races he participates in.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, growing the Tote and working with the Hong Kong Jockey Club and our partners to showcase the best of British and Irish racing via World Pool, it is fantastic to have someone as talented and engaging as Tom join our team. Alex Frost, CEO, UK Tote Group</p>
