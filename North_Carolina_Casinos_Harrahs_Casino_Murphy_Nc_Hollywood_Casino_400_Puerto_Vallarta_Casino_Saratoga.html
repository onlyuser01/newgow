    <h1>North Carolina Casinos Harrahs Casino Murphy Nc Hollywood Casino 400 Puerto Vallarta Casino Saratoga</h1>

<p>The above amount was for submitting purposes, not actual disputed amount.</p>
<p>First off, I’m a Super Platinum player, correction, I’ve been demoted to a Platinum player to restrict amount I can withdraw. These VIP levels are based on depositing into the casino as an incentive to do so. I deposit weekly if not daily, and have so for over a year. I always follow terms and conditions, and until recently, thought of Extreme as the very best online casino.</p>
<p>The next issue is customer service decline drastically, and Bitcoin deposits with full confirmations not being credited for hours. I could understand this issue if there wasn’t 16 confirmations on blockchain of deposit, but not with.</p>
<p>The third issue is violation of terms and conditions in tournaments. I placed in the weekly spinner tournament, as I usually do since I deposit and play large amounts. Per terms and conditions, the winners will have their rewards processed to their account on Wednesdays. Twice now I have had to inquire numerous times to support 2-3 weeks past due redemption of where my rewards are. They publish on their site the weekly winners. This last incident, I was told by department that handles tournaments, that they had forgot to process all rewards from previous tournament upon checking. A week later, still no reward.</p>
<p>My last complaint also involves terms and conditions. I don’t agree with limiting players ability to claim bonuses based on them winnings, due to the fact that casinos publish that their slots are fair and tested for their random play. If slots is a game of chance and is spinning fairly due to being random, you can’t claim a player has skill at a random chance. Furthermore with that said, I understand, or at least accept it as industry practice. My issue is when I deposit bonus free money, and get told that I cannot claim my cashback from multiple deposits because that "promo" isn’t enabled right now?!? WTF? It’s in your terms and conditions for non bonus deposit cashback. It’s the weekend and cashback is higher than weekday. That is one reason I cannot claim. I’m certainly within the 7 days per conditions to claim. There is no "promo" code for cashback bc you have to submit to customer service via chat to claim per terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this last slap in the face is due to winning a 14,000 jackpot win on a sister casino over the weekend. I’ve been demoted and denied terms on Extreme since my win on another site.</p>
