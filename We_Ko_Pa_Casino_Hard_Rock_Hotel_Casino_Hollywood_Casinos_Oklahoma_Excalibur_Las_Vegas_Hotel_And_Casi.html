<p>RSI Becomes Exclusive Official Sports Betting Partner for Magic City Jai-Alai</p>
<p>Chicago-based gaming and betting company Rush Street Interactive announced that it inked an exclusive deal with Magic City Jai-Alai on Monday this week. Under the agreement, RSI became an exclusive Official Sports Betting Partner for Magic City Jai-Alai.</p>
<p>RSI currently operates BetRivers, PlaySugarhouse and RushBet sportsbook brands and under the agreement, BetRivers will be able to use Magic City Jai-Alai’s official league data. Additionally, the brand will be able to stream feeds for bettors who are interested in wagering on live games in real-time. RSI is the first online sportsbook that will offer betting on the new and electrifying head-to-head (H2H) format of Jai-Alai, which is the fastest sport in the world.</p>
<p>Jai-Alai’s Integrity Is Paramount for Magic City</p>
<p>Since its debut in 2018, Magic City Jai-Alai has run more than 4,000 matches. Ensuring the integrity of the sport is in the hands of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) in Florida. The DBPR has taken a specific approach that has significantly improved the reputation of the sport.</p>
<p>Besides conducting background checks for the league’s officials, athletes and staff, the DBPR established collaboration with a third-party integrity firm. The purpose of that contract is yet another step within increasing the integrity field as the firm monitors and analyses all wagering and event activity independently from the DBPR.</p>
<p>“Working closely with the RSI team, we are excited to pioneer a new twist on an old favorite and offer fans exciting and different ways to engage with Jai-Alai while modernizing the sport to a whole new digital betting audience.” Scott Savin, COO at Magic City</p>
<p>Magic City’s COO, Scott Savin revealed that it is exciting to collaborate with the RSI for a new version of a long-term favorite sport. He acknowledged that Magic City has been focused on game and athlete integrity, as well as the innovative and modern-looking league since day one.</p>
<p>RSI Is Excited to Team Up with Magic City’s League</p>
<p>RSI’s CEO, Richard Schwartz, outlined that the company is excited to partner with Magic City, which is a pioneer of the fast-paced Jai-Alai format. He did not miss saying that the sport has a long history in Florida, dating back to the 1930s.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, RSI wants to offer our players engaging and high integrity betting content and we’re thrilled that Magic City’s league is able to achieve both of these goals.” Richard Schwartz, CEO at RSI</p>
<p>Schwartz stressed that the new H2H format of Jai-Alai distances itself from the traditional pari-mutuel betting style, which enables customers to bet “on the head-to-head matchups, set-by-set or even point-by-point just like in the popular betting sports of tennis and table tennis.” Moreover, he added that Jai-Alai is the fastest sport in the world and sometimes the ball speed exceeds 150 mph. In conclusion, Schwartz acknowledged that the new format brings excitement for RSI, as well as the sports bettors who will now have a way to watch games in real-time and bet in-play.</p>
