    <h1>Treasure Chest Casino Wanaaha Casino Southpoint Casino Tiverton Casino Hotel Casinos With No Deposit</h1>

<p>My account has been closed and I am accused of cheating with access to round results after winning 3.6 million USD(played with in BTC) on roobet.com's house game 'Crash'.</p>
<p>I was told I am being investigated for cheating and needed to give level 4 verification to get withdrawal as well. 4 days went by and I arrive to find my account can no longer be logged into, and an email from Roobet stating:</p>
<p>"it's our final conclusion that you have taken advantage of a vulnerability which exposed access to round results. We are aware of the connection, and are required to inform you that we are in the process of pursuing remedy for damages incurred."</p>
<p>It is bad enough they won't pay me, but they are also stating they will pursue me for damages? For simply playing and winning at a game???</p>
<p>I cannot believe it. I actually thought I must be in a nightmare, but this is real - they accuse me of cheating on a SHA256 secured, cryptographically coded game. I thought for sure there would be no problem, and it was just semantics of verifying/AML/KYC but they are actually not paying and accusing of cheating! On Crash!! It makes my head spin.</p>
<p>If you go to https://roobet.com/fair and look at 'Crash', they explain how it works and why it is 'fair'. I say 'fair' because as it turns out if you win lots of money then suddenly they claim 'unfair'. Fair when you lose money though apparently.</p>
<p>To quote from that Crash section:</p>
<p>"This game uses two ingredients:</p>
<p>Server Seed - provided by us</p>
<p>Client Seed - the hash from a crypto block (like Bitcoin or Ethereum)</p>
<p>We take a Server Seed and hash it (SHA256), creating a new Server Seed. Then we take that Server Seed and hash that too. We repeat this process until we have 2 million hashes -- 2 million server seeds. The very first game uses the 2 millionth server seed (in the codesandbox below), and each game after that works backwards down the list of server seeds. Second game uses the 1,999,999th hash and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The Client Seed is a public key that we agree to using before we know what it is. We commit to the hash of a crypto block before that block is mined, and we create all the server seed hashes before committing to this block. This ensures that we could not control the outcome of each game. The current Client Seed is in the codes and box below.</p>
<p>To verify this, you can input the Server Seed to your game in the code below, and you should see the server seeds and game results for the previous 100 games."</p>
<p>They are claiming I cheated on this here game. They stand strong by their code until you win a lot then suddenly their 'fair code' isn't fair. As far as I'm aware and anyone here correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not a genius, but to know the results of this game would either require me to be able to crack SHA256 or crack Bitcoin itself. Neither of those are possible.</p>
<p>Its one thing to claim cheating or exploits on live tables and other stuff that can have casino employees involved or something but denying my win on such a transparent game is theft plain and simple.</p>
<p>I have been a registered user and gambled on the site occasionally for at least a couple years. This is life changing money and words cannot describe how disappointed and angry it makes me to be denied my legit winnings.</p>
