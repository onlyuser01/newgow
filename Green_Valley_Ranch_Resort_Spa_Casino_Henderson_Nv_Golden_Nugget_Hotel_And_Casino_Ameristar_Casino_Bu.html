<p>The content-driven iGaming technology provider, offering services, technology and content for the growing land-based and online gambling industry, Bragg Gaming Group, continues its European expansion. Earlier this week, the company revealed it agreed to supply exclusive games, powering the operations of Play North's leading Dutch online casino brand, Kansino.nl.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted partnership, Bragg agreed to deliver thrilling and engaging games from its proprietary Bragg Studios. Moreover, Kansino.nl customers would benefit from content via the Bragg Remote Games Server (RGS), as well as titles from its Powered by Bragg program. Such games are already live with the leading online gambling brand in the Netherlands, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Games from Bragg Studios' Atomic Slot Lab such as Cai Fu Emperor Ways, Dreamy Genie and Fairy Dust are a part of the portfolio that initially powers the Dutch iGaming brand. Those games have already proven their popularity in the country but under the new deal, they will reach new audiences. Moreover, Bragg said that the collaboration includes the delivery of more exclusive games from different studios for Kansino.nl.</p>
<p>Daphne Xerri, Play North's Director of Product, commented on the topic. "We are pleased to partner with Bragg to bring their proven online casino games to our Dutch players for the first time," she explained. Finally, Xerri pointed out: "Since launching in October 2021, Kansino.nl has gone from strength to strength, building a highly loyal player base, and we are committed to bringing them the very best in online casino entertainment."</p>
<p>Lara Falzon, Bragg's President and Chief Operating Officer, added: "We know that players in the Netherlands have a strong affinity to the exclusive games we offer through our Bragg Studios and Powered by Bragg portfolios." She said that Bragg is excited to expand the reach of its games to new players via the collaboration with Play North. Finally, Falzon revealed: "We have a very strong games roadmap ahead of us, so we are confident we can keep players at Kansino.nl very well entertained today as well as long into the future."</p>
<p>The latest deal complements the growth of Bragg in the Netherlands. Back in October 2021, the company was among the first iGaming providers to secure a certification in the country, allowing it to deliver its content to online gambling operators in the region.</p>
<p>The deal with Play North comes at a time when the Dutch gambling market continues to grow. According to data from H2 Gambling Capital, the iGaming sector in the country is expected to hit $2 billion in gross win for this year.</p>
