<p>Olivier Aubin-Mercier Might be The Very Best Lightweight in PFL</p>
<p>Olivier Aubin-Mercier is 18-5 in his professional career, which started back in 2011. He’s got 8 wins by submission, 8 by decision, and 2 by KO/TKO, while all of his five losses happened by decision. Speaking of his losses, all of them happened in the UFC, which is where he fought for over five years.</p>
<p>His UFC career ended in 2019 after three straight losses. It sounds bad, but the opponents he lost to are now killing it in the UFC – Alexander Hernandez, Gilbert Burns, and Arman Tsarukyan.</p>
<p>Almost two years after he fought in the UFC the last time, Aubin-Mercier made his PFL debut, beating Marcin Held by unanimous decision. From there, he went on to win another six PFL fights, winning the $1 million prize last year after beating Stevie Ray by KO in the final of the 2022 tournament. In 2023, he’s fought just one fight, defeating Shane Burgos by unanimous decision last April.</p>
<p>Anthony Romero’s Got a Bright Future Ahead of Him</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Canadian is 12-1 in his professional career, with most of his fights happening in local promotions around the United States and Canada – KOTC, Ohio Combat League, and so on. This year, he made his PFL debut. It was a part of the PGL Challenger Series 2023, in which we saw him beat Tony Caruso by a unanimous decision.</p>
<p>His proper PFL debut is happening this weekend, and oddsmakers think it’s not gonna go great for him. He just hasn’t shown enough so far to be considered a decent opponent to such an MMA legend as Olivier Aubin-Mercier.</p>
<p>His rival in the PFL 6 event is way better in all areas, but especially wrestling. Romero is primarily a kickboxer, while Aubin-Mercier excels in a variety of martial arts disciplines.</p>
<p>Olivier Aubin-Mercier vs. Anthony Romero PFL 6 Prediction</p>
<p>Nine of Olivier Aubin-Mercier’s last 10 fights lasted for a full number of rounds. The only one that didn’t was the PFL Final last year, in which we saw him beat his opponent by KO. This time, he doesn’t need to do that. Instead of risking aiming for another finish, he can force a slugfest and win by points.</p>
<p>Actually, that’s exactly what we expect to see on June 23. Aubin-Mercier will take down his opponent and keep him pinned to the ground for a long time. And then he just needs to do it long enough to win over the judges’ affection. This way, he’ll minimize the risk of getting hurt, which, at this point, is crucial for him if he wants to challenge for the $1 million prize once again.</p>
<p>Pick: Olivier Aubin-Mercier to win by decision</p>
