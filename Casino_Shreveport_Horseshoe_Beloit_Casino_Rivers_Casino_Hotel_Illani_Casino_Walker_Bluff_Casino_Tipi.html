    <h1>Casino Shreveport Horseshoe Beloit Casino Rivers Casino Hotel Illani Casino Walker Bluff Casino Tipi</h1>

<p>NetEnt has become one of the first partners for Tipico’s pending launch in the United States and the New Jersey market in particular.</p>
<p>Tipico Teams up with NetEnt for a New Jersey Launch</p>
<p>Expanding on its recently-announced marketing efforts in the United States and New Jersey, Tipico has secured a content deal with NetEnt. Tipico is bringing 15 years of expertise from Europe and making bold forays into the U.S. markets.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Tipico will launch a range of NetEnt slot and table games for its operations in New Jersey once the company has finalized setting up in the state. Tipico will also get access to NetEnt’s dedicated suite of marketing tools designed to help bolster the company’s marketing efforts in the state.</p>
<p>Tipico is still trying to finalize the process of obtaining a license from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (NJDGE). The company is working with Atlantic City’s Ocean Casino Resort to run the digital store as that’s part of the licensing agreement for any gaming operator in the country.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, Tipico U.S. managing director Adrian Vella had this to say:</p>
<p>“We are excited to begin our partnership with NetEnt as we kick-off our expansion into the US. With a proven track record in the New Jersey market and their well-known catalogue of branded games, we’re confident that our customers will love NetEnt’s offering.”</p>
<p>NetEnt Welcomes the Partnership, Tipico Establishes Itself</p>
<p>NetEnt Americas vice president of commercial, Brian Kraft, shared the sentiment, arguing that the company was happy to team up with Tipico and be one of the first content providers for the company in its upcoming debut on the U.S. market. “I’m looking forward to having our games in front of players and working with Tipico to grow their business in the US,” Kraft concluded.</p>
<p>Tipico is quickly adding to a growing list of partnerships. Last week, the company teamed up with Scientific Games to use the company’s OpenGaming product suite for the New Jersey market once again. Thanks to the Open Gaming System, Tipico will have access to 2,000 quality iGaming products that it can launch on its own NJ-facing website once it is given final approval by the regulator.</p>
<p>New Jersey is one of the first markets in the United States to offer online gaming and sports betting and one of the most developed when it comes to gaming products in general.</p>
