    <h1>Casinos On The Las Vegas Strip Casino Yaamava Jacks Casino Jumba Bet Casino Saratoga Hotel Casino K9</h1>

<p>Hi, i’m a regular player in this website and i have played for several months. Today 29/08/2020 at the time of 3.53pm(Sg time) I deposited $100 into my account, i am a gambler so i believe many players seldom read the terms and condition and just gamble. I have deposited $100 and i have won $500 amounting to my total credit of $600. I did not click any bonus and i withdraw my winnings. My withdrawal request got rejected and i asked the live chat. They were not cooperative to answer me why i got rejected but simply just tell me got rejected because i didn’t met Number 3 of the terms and condition which is i can’t go all in if the amount is less than $1500. I did an all in of $100 because i only deposited $100 and i have did this more than 2-3 times via the same account and did not have this problem i have today which is i can’t withdraw because it’s less than a $1500 all in. But the minimum is already $100 in the blackjack. I have did this several times and i manage to withdraw. If i was rejected the first few times when i withdraw previously, i would definitely not have did it today. But the live chat just blatantly answer me that it’s rejected and tell me to re bet. I feel it is very unfair, i admit its my mistake because it’s written in the terms and condition, but if this is so previously they should have rejected my withdrawal but they accepted. So it is really very unfair for me because i played it properly and i am a regular customer. I hope i can get a valid reason on this and i want back my winnings. Hope you can help me please thank you. My username in K9win is Chorbeng9</p>
