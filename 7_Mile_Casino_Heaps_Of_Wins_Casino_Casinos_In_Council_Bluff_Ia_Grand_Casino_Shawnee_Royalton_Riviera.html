<p>Abios needs the data offered by GRID in order to build new cutting-edge products</p>
<p>Abios, a Kambi Group-owned esports data and betting solutions provider, has teamed up with GRID. Under the new agreement, the latter company will provide its new subsidiary with data from its proprietary GRID Data Platform.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, GRID will provide data for some of the biggest esports betting titles on the market, including games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, VALORANT and Dota 2.</p>
<p>Thanks to its agreement with Abios, GRID’s official gaming data will reach some of the most influential brands within the Kambi partner network. The delivery will be quick and accurate while providing granularity that is essential for esports betting.</p>
<p>Abios will leverage the new data to enhance its cutting-edge esports odds feeds and widgets. Abios will fuel its odds products with this data, providing live markets with higher uptime and a higher degree of automation in odds models. This will make Abios’ offerings more beneficial to Kambi’s existing partners and new customers.</p>
<p>Having secured real-time data, Abios will be able to up its coverage for certain offerings, such as same-game parlays, player propositions and flash markets. In addition, Kambi network partners will get access to real-time widgets and streams that will truly set them apart from other sports betting operators.</p>
<p>GRID boasts a rich data library thanks to its multiple agreements with influential gaming companies and esports event organizers. The provider has existing agreements with juggernauts such as Riot Games, KRAFTON, WePlay Studios and PGL, among others. In addition to data, GRID also provides in-house integrity services and proprietary modeling capabilities which are now available to Abios.</p>
<p>Abios and Kambi Are Excited to Build on Top of the GRID Portfolio</p>
<p>Kambi Group’s founder and chief executive officer, Oskar Fröberg, commented on the newly-minted agreement with GRID. He noted that partnerships with official esports data industry leaders are crucial to Abios as they allow it to “unlock the full potential of the esports betting market.</p>
<p>The real-time data provided by GRID is crucial to be able to build and offer cutting-edge products. The best end-user experiences and most competitive products will be built on official data and as such we at Abios and Kambi look forward to building on top of the GRID portfolio. Oskar Fröberg, founder &amp; CEO, Kambi Group</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GRID’s chief sales officer, Mikael Westerling, said that his team cannot wait to inject official data into the Kambi ecosystem. He praised Kambi for the value it brings to its partners.</p>
<p>The unique value coming from the scale of Kambi’s network, visionary approach, and the Abios’ products capabilities have been continuously impressing us at GRID, and we are committed to ensure their products can thrive powered by GRID data. Mikael Westerling, chief sales officer, GRID</p>
<p>A month ago, Abios secured a B2B license in Sweden, allowing it to provide esports data to local companies.</p>
