<p>The leading technology company focusing on projects related to gaming and esports in strategic markets across the globe, GGTech Entertainment, announced a new appointment. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it strengthened its senior-level team with the appointment of the gaming, e-commerce and entertainment industry veteran, Cristina Carranza, to the role of Head of Global Sales.</p>
<p>Becoming a part of the company's C-suite, the seasoned executive brings extensive experience from the digital, gaming and entertainment sectors. Overall, Carranza brings more than 10 years of experience which enabled her to accumulate unique skills and achieve a track record while being a part of international companies.</p>
<p>Sharing her excitement GGTech's new Head of Global Sales commented in a statement, saying: "I have been working with GGTech for more than four years and I have fallen in love with their company culture, the great human quality of their team and their vision of what they want GGTech to become, making it the world leading company for entertainment, gaming, and esports." Moreover, Carranza said that she is proud to join the company at such an important moment and spearhead the growth of its global business and sales strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, Carranza explained: "The digital entertainment industry, the streaming world and the ‘gaming boom’ are some of the drivers that generate this great business opportunity for which GGTech is ideally positioned, the challenge now lies in transferring this vision to other regions and sharing the brand’s products and services to the most passionate fans of the video gaming world."</p>
<p>Before joining GGTech, she held important roles with globally recognized companies. While a part of Twitch, Carranza played an important role in the launch of Twitch Ads in Spain. Her professional background includes experience with global gaming programs, including Amazon UNIVERSITY Esports and Amazon GAMERGY. As a Head of Global Sales, Carranza is expected to help propel GGTech's growth and contribute toward the establishment of new business relationships.</p>
<p>The latest senior-level appointment comes during a busy period for the company. Recently, GGTech expanded to new territories and forged new collaborations within the esports and gaming verticals. Most notably, earlier this year, the company agreed to promote Riot Games' university esports competitions across the United States. This helped the company realize the need for stronger management that would complement its future expansion.</p>
