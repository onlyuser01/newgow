    <h1>Santa Claran Hotel And Casino Future Coins Casino Monticello Casino Lucky Eagle Casino Eagle Pass Ca</h1>

<p>Dear babsbh,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://winown.com/en/terms_and_conditions/:</p>
<p>"RESPONSIBLE GAMING/GAMBLING</p>
<p>For those customers who wish to restrict their gambling, we provide a voluntary self-exclusion policy, which enables You to close Your Account or restrict Your ability to place bets or game on the Website for a minimum period of six months. You can ask that the restriction lasts for a period of up to five years. Once Your Account has been self-excluded You will be unable to reactivate the Account under any circumstances until the expiry of the period chosen under this paragraph. At the expiry of the self-exclusion period You will be entitled to re-commence use of the Services by contacting Customer Services or by opening a new account.</p>
<p>If You require any information relating to this facility please speak to Customer Services through the Help tab or view our Responsible Gaming section.</p>
<p>We will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure compliance with self-exclusion. However, self-exclusion requires the joint commitment of both You and Winown. During the self-exclusion period You must not attempt to try to open new accounts and You accept that we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if You continue gambling and/or seek to use the Website and we fail to recognise or determine that You have requested self-exclusion in circumstances which are beyond our reasonable control including, but not limited to, You opening a new account, gambling in an LBO or over the telephone rather than over the internet or using a different name or address.</p>
<p>Winown is committed to supporting Responsible Gambling initiatives.</p>
<p>Any self-exclusion implemented in terms of Clause 33.1 above are offered:</p>
<p>(a) For all the games offered by us; and</p>
<p>(b) Across all the means by which we provide the Services.</p>
<p>Since we require separate player registration, where we operate multiple brands (websites operated by us and/or our Group), we will ensure self-exclusion to be implemented to Your activity on the brand on which You have requested self-exclusion, and Your requested self-exclusion shall be applicable to that individual brand.</p>
<p>You are not entitled to open a new Account if You have had already an Account closed by us at any of the websites operated by us and/or our Group or at Your request under Paragraph 33 (Responsible Gaming/Gambling), though we do not take responsibility if You have attempted and succeeded to open a new Account due to circumstances mentioned in Clause 33.3.</p>
<p>We will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure compliance with self-exclusion. However, self-exclusion requires the joint commitment of both You and us. During the self-exclusion period You must not attempt to try to open new accounts and You accept that we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if You continue gambling and/or seek to use the Website and/or any of the websites operated by us and/or our Group, and we fail to recognise or determine that You have requested self-exclusion in circumstances which are beyond our reasonable control including, but not limited to, You opening a new account, using a different name or address, etc."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s not written that all your accounts in other casinos of the same owner will be blocked or self-excluded automatically. Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have requested a self-exclusion from WinOwn Casino directly?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
