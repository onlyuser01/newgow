<p>Online and Mobile Sports Betting by William Hill Now Available in WV</p>
<p>The U.S. sportsbook market leader William Hill announced the launch of online and mobile sports betting in West Virginia. Announced yesterday, the operator said that its mobile app and website will be available to use from anywhere in the Mountain State.</p>
<p>The mobile app, which is built on William Hill’s proprietary platform, offers a seamless betting experience. Furthermore, the sports betting app is easy to use but also fast and features a vast array of markets and bet types for sports fans. The Mountain State sports fans now also can wager on live games of both college and professional teams.</p>
<p>William Hill’s Sports Book App is available for download on any Apple or Android device in West Virginia. Sports fans in the state that use William Hill’s mobile app can choose from multiple deposit and withdrawal options. The live scoring game casts are also available as well as an easy and secure registration process. The operator revealed that new customers who create an account and make a digital deposit will receive a 100% match up to $150 as well as an extra $10 as a registration bonus.</p>

<p>Let’s make it interesting.https://t.co/9yEeZg57wt — William Hill West Virginia (@WilliamHillWV) September 4, 2020</p>
<p>Sports Betting Offering of William Hill Continues to Grow</p>
<p>William Hill US is part of FTSE-listed William Hill PLC. Established in 2012, William Hill US now operates more than 150 locations in 12 U.S. states. Currently, mobile sports betting apps by William Hill are available in four states: Iowa, Nevada, New Jersey, and West Virginia. Furthermore, the operator powers the trading services of the mobile app for the Rhode Island Lottery.</p>
<p>Last week, the Nevada Gaming Commission gave the green light for the acquisition of GC Technologies by William Hill US. The operator did not wait long and earlier this week, acquired GC. Under the acquisition, William Hill effectively took over six established Las Vegas properties including:</p>
<p>Venetian Las Vegas</p>
<p>Tropicana Las Vegas</p>
<p>Cosmopolitan Las Vegas</p>
<p>Palazzo</p>
<p>Palms</p>
<p>Silverton</p>
<p>The deal undoubtedly expanded the presence of William Hill in Nevada and on the Las Vegas Strip. But here is what Joe Asher, William Hill US CEO said about the recent acquisition: “This acquisition further expands our footprint, giving us a bigger presence on the Las Vegas Strip at several world-renowned resorts. It’s a very exciting time for our company as we continue to grow and introduce our offerings to new customers.“</p>
<p>With that in mind, the operator does not plan to stop expanding. Asher confirmed that William Hill is discussing possible options for combining its sports betting and online gaming with Caesars. Caesars estimates that a combined business can generate up to $700 million in revenue in 2021. But according to gaming industry analysts, combined U.S. online operations of William Hill and Caesars could be worth some $7 billion and may result in a publicly-traded joint venture.</p>
