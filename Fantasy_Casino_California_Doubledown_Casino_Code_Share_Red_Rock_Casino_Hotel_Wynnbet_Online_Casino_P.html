<p>Fans of the bantamweight division have a lot to look forward to as Vegas 37 approaches. With the event scheduled for Saturday, September 18, the bout between Nathan Maness and Tony Gravely promises to be one of the most spectacular ones to see. Maness is a UFC prospect that is taking on a formidable and well-seasoned fighter in the face of Gravely.</p>
<p>Both fighters are fairly new to the UFC, with hardly four finishes each. One is a heavy underdog, with Nate Maness posted at (+180), whereas the other, Tony Gravely, is looking at (-210). With the fight locked in for the UFC Apex this weekend, we are definitely happy to tune in and watch the event at ESPN+.</p>

<p>Tale of the Tape: Maness vs Gravely</p>
<p>Nate Maness Stats Tony Gravely 5’10” Height 5′ 5″ 135 lbs Weight 135 lbs 72″ Reach 69″ Orthodox Stance Orthodox 13-1-0 Record 21-6-0</p>
<p>Gravely in the Lead, Both Fighters New to UFC</p>
<p>The overall track record puts the veteran Tony Gravely as the favorite with his (-210) but the truth is that both fighters are fairly inexperienced in the UFC. Gravely has won three out of his four finishes and he appears in the octagon on Saturday on the back of two successful fights.</p>
<p>He posts slightly inferior attributes such as height and reach but he is good at submitting the opponent as well as KO/TKO. He took on Anthony Birchak and Geraldo de Freitas and won. His overall career record is no less impressive, with 21 wins and 6 losses which is great by MMA standards.</p>
<p>However, he will face a fighter who is keen on making a name for himself. Maness is the underdog in this bout at (+180). He has only two appearances in the UFC and has won both. Furthermore, his career track record is 13-1-0, which means a single loss so far.</p>
<p>While the sportsbooks seem to underestimate Maness, we believe the moneyline value he offers is great. He defeated Luke Sanders (13-5-0) and Johnnny Munoz (11-1-0). Granted, both of those fighters are nothing too impressive when it comes to the Ultimate Fighting Championship.</p>
<p>Still, we believe Nate has a fair shot, and undervaluing him here may be a mistake on the part of bookmakers.</p>
