<p>125/1 Golfer Wins PGA Tour 3M Open, 20-Year-Old Matthew Wolff Fends Off Bryson DeChambeau</p>

<p>The PGA Tour has a new winner, and his name is Matthew Wolff, a 20-year-old who fended off a Sunday charge from Bryson DeChambeau in stylish fashion at the 3M Open.</p>

<p>Just moments after DeChambeau made an eagle on the 18th to go up by one, Wolff rolled in a 26-footer for his own three on the par-5 to claim his first PGA Tour victory.</p>
<p>I had a blast out there, and to make that putt was everything,” he said after the win. “You know, for me it was just kind of staying calm, doing what I do. And not a lot of putts were dropping today. I kind of told myself, ‘This wouldn’t be a bad time for one to go my way.'”</p>
<p>With the victory, Wolff receives a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour, and is eligible for the postseason FedExCup Playoffs. He also won $1.15 million on Sunday.</p>
<p>Longshot Golfer</p>
<p>Wolff entered the 3M Open at TPC Twin Cities at a long 125/1 in Las Vegas (implied odds of just 0.79 percent). Bettors who risked just $5 on those odds won $625.</p>
<p>After a sizzling round of 62 that followed rounds of 69 and 67, the Westgate SuperBook slashed his title chances to 6/1. The sportsbook had DeChambeau the favorite at 5/2, as they were tied heading into the final round along with Collin Morikawa.</p>
<p>Wolff and Morikawa are both in the field this week again. They’re respectively at 25/1 and 20/1 to win the John Deere Classic. The SuperBook has Viktor Hovland with slightly trimmer odds at 18/1. Other notables include Lucas Glover and Zach Johnson (25/1), and Ryan Moore (30/1).</p>
<p>Open Field</p>
<p>The John Deere is the final PGA Tour event before the world’s best golfers meet in Northern Ireland for The Open Championship at Royal Portrush Golf Club. It’s also the final shot for players seeking entry into the final major of 2019.</p>
<p>Brooks Koepka, the four-time major winner, is the favorite to become champion golfer of the year and hoist the Claret Jug. The SuperBook has him at 8/1 to win. He’s the co-favorite with Rory McIlroy, who won The Open in 2014.</p>
<p>Dustin Johnson is next at 12/1, and then it’s Tiger Woods (16/1), and Justin Rose and Francesco Molinari at 20/1. Wolff’s line has been drastically cut to 60/1.</p>
<p>The longshots in the field include former champions whose games have long exited their prime. Champions under the age of 60 are exempt to compete in The Open.</p>
<p>They include 2001 winner David Duval at 3000/1 odds. If the former world No. 1 can do the seemingly unthinkable and return to form and win at Royal Portrush, every $10 risked would net $30,000. However, don’t get your hopes up, as Duval has played the weekend just once in the last 10 Opens. His best finish was a T49 in 2015 when the tournament was held at St. Andrew’s.</p>
