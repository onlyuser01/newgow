<p>The global gaming leader, International Game Technology (IGT), announced that its subsidiary, IGT Global Solutions Corporation, together with Scientific Games (SG), and their local partner, SAGA Consultoria e Representações Comerciais e Empresariais, established a new consortium. This collaboration granted them the concession of the instant and passive lottery for Brazil’s State of Minas Gerais, the Minas Gerais State Lottery (LEMG).</p>
<p>The new collaboration has a term of 20 years and grants the consortium an exclusive license for the lottery operations in Minas Gerais. Thanks to the collaboration, which has an option for a 20-year renewal, the consortium will operate instant games, as well as instant ticket systems and passive lottery games.</p>
<p>Michael Conforti, SG’s president of international, shared that the company is excited to deliver its extensive experience within the lottery vertical for the new deal with SAGA and IGT in Brazil. “The sole purpose of our consortium is to build a lottery operation focused on maximizing revenues for LEMG’s beneficiary programs,” he explained. Finally, Conforti predicted that players in the state will be able to benefit from world-class instant scratch games complemented by a secure gaming system that is convenient for the retail sector.</p>
<p>“We are excited to bring our 50 years of expertise in lottery instant games, analytics, systems and management services to Brazil through our partnership with IGT and SAGA.“ Michael Conforti, president of international at Scientific Games</p>
<p>IGT Is Excited to Begin This Partnership</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, IGT’s chief operating officer, global lottery, was similarly excited about the new collaboration. He said that the company is thrilled to enter the market in Brazil via the tie-up with SAGA and SG. Gendron noted that IGT will deliver its extensive experience within the lottery vertical which will help deliver new forms of entertainment for the players and help raise money for good causes.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to enter the Brazilian lottery market through this partnership with Scientific Games and SAGA, leveraging IGT’s decades-long experience operating some of the world’s largest lotteries, along with best-in-class instant ticket and passive lottery solutions for player entertainment and good causes.“ Jay Gendron, chief operating officer, global lottery at IGT</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new 20-year agreement, the companies will have different priorities related to the operation of instant tickets. Not unexpectedly, SG and IGT will spearhead the printed instant games operations and will be actively engaged in the production and planning. On the other hand, SG will also deliver the necessary management software and system required for the lottery’s operations in Minas Gerais.</p>
