    <h1>Rio All Suite Hotel And Casino Muckleshoot Casino Auburn Wa Casinos Colorado Casino In Baltimore Riv</h1>

<p>I play a lot on different sites and have wondered how casino guru rates sites. When I see offers for tournaments and they have predatory terms and conditions I ask myself has casino guru done it's homework or do they recommend sites for some other reason.</p>
<p>For instance wild casino has a $50,000 grand prize tournament which has a 50x rollover and a 2x max cash out. That mean if you were a winner you would then have to wager $2.5 million before you could withdraw a max cash out of only $100,000. Now I believe in luck I wouldn't gamble if I didn't but terms like these are impossible to meet and greedy as can be. Not saying it cannot be done but I can say that I bet nobody has ever done that and if they have I bet they work for the casino. So how does a very good reputation get given to a site that obviously has teams that are not in the best interests of their players? Also it might be helpful when discussing sites that an important factor such as not being able to make a withdrawal for 7 days if you use a credit card for deposit. No gambler I know is going to have money on the casino floor for seven days without using any of it and losing it all back in that time. Things like this make one question if casino guru is a marketing partner with the sites they approve or just not thorough in their reviews. Any thoughts would be interesting to hear</p>
