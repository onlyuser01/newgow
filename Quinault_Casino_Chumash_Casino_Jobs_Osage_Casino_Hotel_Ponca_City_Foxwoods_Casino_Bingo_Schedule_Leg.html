<p>Grupo Pefaco has announced plans to digitalize its operations in Africa, hoping to branch out into a new gaming segment and push forward with its long-term ambition to establish itself as the dominating gaming and entertainment giant on the continent.</p>
<p>To get there, the company is securing the services of Moobifun, a company that suppliers turnkey iGaming solutions to businesses interested in launching their gaming operations online. Both companies are interested in using this partnership as a springboard for their future expansion and success in Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>Moobifun will make it easier for Grupo Pefaco to achieve better engagement with customers. Each market covered by the companies will come with a tailored solution deployed by Moobifun in a bid to ensure that the operator is making real forays into the continent.</p>
<p>Some of the targeted countries include Benin, Togo, Niger, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, and Burundi. Moobifun is bringing its own Mobile Money payment gateway to help along with seamless integration and depositing options.</p>
<p>Commenting on this business opportunity, Moobifun Head of Business Development &amp; Sales Louis Mecklembourg welcomed this opportunity and said that it would make for a very successful business. Mecklembourg praised the established track-record of the land-based operations of Grupo Pefaco.</p>
<p>Building upon that experience, Moobifun will now help Grupo Pefaco break ground in the digital sector. Mecklembourg cited the company’s localized experience with digital audiences as the reason why he believes in the future success of the collaboration.</p>
<p>Africa has been hitting the newswires a lot recently. TVBet introduced its products with Bitville and Pigg’s Peak Casino, but the company is hardly the only one that has been actively expanding the market. Meanwhile, industry bodies have also been looking to strengthen their presence in Africa, with IBIA teaming up with BetKing to help ensure a safer and level playing field for everyone.</p>
<p>More partnerships have been established across Africa with Betfred buying a stake out of LottoStar. Africa is going to be an increasingly important market for iGaming stakeholders who are making strategic investments as they anticipate further growth.</p>
<p>888 Holdings launched a joint-venture by the name of 888Africa to focus exclusively on this market and its particularities.</p>
