    <h1>Bitcoin Casino Cloudbet Casino Grand Lake Casino In Oklahoma Gold Coast Casino Hotel Horseshoe Balti</h1>

<p>Uberlucky Casino:</p>
<p>Hello, I had a payment of 1000 euros paid out to my bank account via "INPAY" on May 2nd, 2023.</p>
<p>my withdrawal was verified about 2 hours later and marked as complete.</p>
<p>I already had daily contact with the customer live support via chat and ask every day why my money is not transferred to my account.</p>
<p>my account has been fully verified for over 6 months and has already been able to pay out successfully in the past. The payout in the past was directly in my account after a few hours.</p>
<p>in the live chat I am always put off that they have technical problems and that there are delays.</p>
<p>Then I am informed that the money has long since been released and should have been in my account long ago and that the payment provider INPAY would be contacted and I would then receive a response via email.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for a response from the payment provider for 2 days.</p>
<p>I don't think that an answer from INPAY will take that long, because I contacted the payment provider INPAY myself about my problem. However, they cannot give me any information because I have no direct business relationship with them.</p>
<p>I received this answer from INPAY within 2 hours of my request.</p>
<p>I've written emails to Annen Support from Uberlucky myself and I'm always put off.</p>
<p>Now I've read at UBERlucky that they will stop operating by the end of May and of course I'm afraid that they don't want to pay out my winnings and want to hold them back until their casino is closed.</p>
<p>I have already emailed the complaints office and nothing happened.</p>
<p>So I have already turned to the following places:</p>
<p>Customer live chat</p>
<p>support@uberlucky.com</p>
<p>info@gaminglicences.com</p>
<p>I took all screenshots of my "successful payment" and all chat histories.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that I can be helped here.</p>
<p>Thanks so much</p>
