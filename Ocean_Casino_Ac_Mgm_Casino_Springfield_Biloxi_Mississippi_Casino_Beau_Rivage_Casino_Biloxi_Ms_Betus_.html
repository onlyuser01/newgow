<p>This strategic move aligns with FairPlay’s mission to transform BetTech for the benefit of global consumers, publishers, and betting operators</p>
<p>FairPlay Sports Media, the owner of Oddschecker, has completed its first acquisition under the newly established brand by acquiring Toronto-based deep-learning firm Quarter4. FairPlay gains cutting-edge sporting outcome prediction solutions, bolstering its current offerings and making its products more attractive globally. Both companies were excited about this development, highlighting their shared values.</p>
<p>Quarter4 Offers Unique Technological Advantages</p>
<p>FairPlay’s recent rebrand from Oddschecker Global Media reflects its broader focus beyond the betting sector. The company is well-known for its unorthodox betting offerings, allowing users to wager on outcomes like the US presidential race or Kim Kardashian’s next boyfriend. The rebrand reflects a desire to expand beyond the betting sector by utilizing emerging technologies.</p>
<p>The company intends to explore investments or acquisitions at the intersection of data, media, and betting, particularly emphasizing AI technologies, motivating its recent purchase. FairPlay Sports Media CEO Stuart Simms noted that this move was a significant milestone, propelling the company’s market-leading data and tech platform to new heights through enhanced behavioral analytic capabilities.</p>
<p>Bringing Quarter4 into the group can act as the catalyst for many new and improved product developments in the coming months and beyond. Stuart Simms, FairPlay Sports Media CEO</p>
<p>The acquisition of Quarter4 allows FairPlay’s brands, including Oddschecker and WhoScored.com, to leverage the sports prediction service offered by Quarter4, combining it with FairPlay’s historical price movement data across millions of global sporting events. This integration should immediately improve FairPlay’s existing offerings and influence its future tech-led activities.</p>
<p>Past Collaborations Should Significantly Ease This Transition</p>
<p>FairPlay intends to use Quarter4’s products to provide additional value to its media and publication partners, including Reach plc, Gazzetta, DAZN, and Forbes. These media publishers can create more engaging content for their readers beyond traditional ‘tipster’ and ‘capper’ content. Betting operators should also gain pricing efficiencies, particularly in complex markets like player props and micro betting.</p>
<p>Quarter4’s prediction models have already been introduced to Oddschecker’s registered users in previous partnerships, covering various US sports like American football, basketball, and ice hockey. Quarter4 co-founder and CEO Kelly Brooks was excited to embark on this new chapter for the company, joining forces with FairPlay to provide industry-leading user experiences.</p>
<p>The technical synergies between the FairPlay group and Quarter4 are clear, and we’re ready to deliver more value to our various partners worldwide. Kelly Brooks, Quarter4 co-founder and CEO</p>
<p>FairPlay will immediately leverage this new acquisition as it prepares to launch Quarter4’s March Madness 2024 product. This offering will give audiences a state-of-the-art AI-powered predictor tool, bolstering engagement and retention. The event will be the perfect testing ground for the two companies’ combined technologies, exploring the most efficient way to utilize their synergies.</p>
