    <h1>Havasu Landing Resort Casino Whisky Pete S Hotel And Casino Nevada Golden Nugget Casino Michigan Sho</h1>

<p>The acclaimed supplier of array of casino and gaming products has further expanded its reach in Ghana and the African market</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has struck a multi-year deal with PrideBet, a prominent local operator in the market and will deploy its content with the brand. This includes slot games such as the Big Bass series, The Knight King most recent game release, and established titles, such as Gates of Olympus and Sugar Rush.</p>
<p>GhanaBet Secures More Quality Content for Local Players</p>
<p>The titles provided by Pragmatic Play come with excellent graphics and 24/7 support by the company which delivers high-quality rendering and graphics, immersive gameplay, and industry-leading mechanics. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides welcome the opportunity to expand the company’s footprint into the market and said:</p>
<p>We’re delighted to welcome PrideBet to our ever-expanding client base. Ghana is one of the biggest and most highly regulated markets in Africa. With player protection and sustainability being top priorities for Pragmatic Play, this partnership represents an excellent opportunity for us to expand our presence on the continent. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>PrideBet Ghana country manager Kwadwo Amaning-Kwarteng was similarly pleased with the partnership and opportunity therein, arguing that Pragmatic Play is a strong strategic partner that would help the brand continue to deliver on its targets and objectives.</p>
<p>PrideBet will be able to now provide local audiences with even more worthwhile and established quality slots and virtual sports content from Pragmatic’s library, which also features Live Casino and Bingo games. The collaboration is established so that PrideBet can live up to the full potential of its brand, PrideBet – Together We Play.</p>
<p>“Bringing in elite-level content will allow us to attract even more fans of both verticals,” Amaning-Kwarteng said. Pragmatic Play has been on a tear over the past weeks, launching a number of excellent slots, including Mask of Montezuma, 3 Dancing Monkeys and other games. Pragmatic Play is also working on supporting its Drops &amp; Wins format with more eight-figure jackpots.</p>
