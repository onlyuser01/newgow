<p>Allwyn Group continues its preparations to assume management of the UK National Lottery by bringing in seasoned industry veteran Robert Chvátal as UK CEO</p>
<p>The multi-national lottery operator has been extremely busy in the past several months, balancing its latest high-profile acquisition with its upcoming UK responsibilities. Chvátal will focus the company’s efforts on the island nation, hopefully allowing Allwyn UK to complete its 2023 goals on time and without any significant setbacks.</p>
<p>The UK Remains Allwyn’s Current Priority</p>
<p>Allwyn has been frantically preparing to assume one of the most demanding positions in the company’s history by becoming the next UK National Lottery operator. Acquiring incumbent operator Camelot allowed the Czech company to immediately take the reins, but ensuring a smooth transition remains a daunting challenge.</p>
<p>The lottery operator already took steps towards bolstering its objectives by hiring Kerry Parkin as global communications director. While she pledged to help the group’s international objectives, Allwyn’s senior management was apparently unsatisfied with its UK progress, opting for another high-profile hire and concentrating the brunt of its efforts in the island nation.</p>
<p>The New CEO Boasts Substantial Experience</p>
<p>Robert Chvátal replaces David Craven as Allwyn UK CEO as Allwyn Group believes that successfully integrating Camelot and completing the company’s objectives regarding the national lottery appointment requires a different skill set and leadership style. Chvátal expressed readiness to ensure the success of Allwyn’s UK-facing efforts by delivering a smooth and seamless transition.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with our UK team and partners… to deliver on our commitment for a bigger, better, and safer National Lottery. Robert Chvátal, Allwyn UK CEO</p>
<p>Chvátal is a tried and true industry veteran, occupying leadership positions with several high-profile companies. He spent ten years as CEO of T-Mobile’s Slovak and Austrian branches before moving on to head Czech lottery company SAZKA. He successfully steered the company for over seven years, turning it into one of the most dynamically growing lottery groups in Europe, and now stands ready to tackle an even harsher challenge.</p>
<p>Allwyn Builds on Its Previous Successes</p>
<p>Allwyn retains its commitment to deliver the transition to the fourth UK national lottery license on schedule. The company had to navigate many legal challenges to reach this point, so Chvátal will need to utilize his substantial experience in the lottery business to tackle the upcoming challenges.</p>
<p>Chvátal’s appointment should free up some of Allwyn Group’s attention to focus on the situation overseas. The Camelot acquisition was instrumental in another way, as it granted Allwyn its coveted entry into the US market. The company now manages the Illinois Lottery, paving the way for future expansion in the US. Allwyn also maintains a presence in Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, and Italy, providing a solid foundation for future success.</p>
