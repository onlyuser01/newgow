    <h1>Casino Oregon Coast Casino Soundtrack Casino Public Relations Potawatomi Carter Casino Hotel Mandala</h1>

<p>A fast-expanding supplier of skill-based games, Galaxsys has signed a new and pivotal partnership that will allow it to reach wider audiences</p>
<p>Thanks to its tie-up with Pariplay, which is part of NeoGames Group, Galaxsys will have the opportunity to expand the reach of its skill games vertical and team up with new companies. Pariplay provides aggregation solutions that make it easier for suppliers to access new operators, brands, and their audiences. Galaxsys has previously struck similar deals with Markor Technology and Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>Galaxsys Brings Non-Linear and Innovative Content</p>
<p>Galaxsys brings its Fast Games portfolio, which focuses on a brand new type of gaming content that is designed to be quick, dependable, and lead to high levels of engagement between operators and their customers. As a result, the games available to Pariplay’s audiences right now include instant, crash, and mine titles, along with excellent non-traditional slots and Plinko experiences for everyone to try.</p>
<p>Galaxsys SVP of sales and business development Gil Soffer welcomed the opportunity to see his company work with Pariplay and the company’s Pariplay Fusion aggregation platform. Soffer hailed Pariplay as a tier-one operator and a company that has demonstrated its clear commitment to matching suppliers and operators.</p>
<p>Our portfolio comprises over eighteen fast and skill games, several crash games, fast table games, keno, and Asian games, and focuses on innovation and player engagement. We aim to provide thirty new fast games by the end of 2023. Galaxsys SVP of sales and business development Gil Soffer</p>
<p>Soffer further added that the tie-up with Pariplay will significantly help Galaxsys enhance the player game experience, back-office conversion and retention.</p>
<p>Galaxsys is Happy to Work with Pariplay on Expanding Reach</p>
<p>The two companies’ combined resources would now mean much better results across the board for everyone involved, with Galaxsys aiming to roll out its products with international partners and operators that are part of Pariplay’s sprawling aggregation ecosystem.</p>
<p>Galaxsys head of sales department Teni Grigoryan was similarly pleased with the opportunity. He welcomed the opportunity to be working with Pariplay and said that the company would make it possible for the supplier to integrate its large portfolio of games in a seamless and efficient manner. “We look forward to supporting Pariplay over the months ahead as our products increase,” Grigoryan said.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been making sure to help partners globally. The company recently teamed up with Urgent Games, adding it to the Fusion platform for expanded reach. The company similarly helped with the integration of Wizard Games for the iGaming market in Ontario with Caesars Entertainment.</p>
