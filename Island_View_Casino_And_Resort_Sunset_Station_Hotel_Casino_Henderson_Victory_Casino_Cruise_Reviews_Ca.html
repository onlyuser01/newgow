<p>Manufacturer of casino equipment and supplier of gambling technology International Game Technology (IGT) announced its lottery received recertification by the World Lottery Association (WLA) for meeting its responsibility standards.</p>
<p>Standards to ‘Minimize the Impact of Problem Gambling’</p>
<p>NYSE-listed IGT received WLA’s Corporate Social Responsibility Standards and Responsible Gaming Framework for Suppliers accreditation for its lottery operations after passing a robust assessment on the eight sections of standards WLA designed to “minimize the impact of problem gambling” via its worldwide program aimed at the gaming industry operators and suppliers.</p>
<p>Wendy Montgomery, SVP of Marketing, Communications, and Sustainability at IGT, highlighted the importance of responsible gaming that is “engrained into the fabric” of the company, in its products and people, and always “at the forefront” in decision-making.</p>
<p>“This recertification from WLA reinforces our leadership and commitment as a responsible vendor, as well as demonstrates the effectiveness of our responsible gaming technologies that we provide to our lottery customers worldwide.” Wendy Montgomery, SVP, Marketing, Communications and Sustainability, IGT</p>
<p>The recertification followed a thorough assessment of IGT’s lottery operations conducted by a WLA-approved assessor to determine whether the operator is in alignment with WLA standards related to research, programs for employees, development of products and services, remote gaming environment, advertising and marketing communications, customer awareness, engagement via stakeholders and reporting.</p>
<p>Leader in Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>Senior Corporate Social Responsibility Manager at WLA Melissa Azam outlined the leadership role IGT holds in the responsible gaming space, influencing industry standards and practices.</p>
<p>“Its decades-long responsible gaming commitment spans the Company’s products and solutions and is a key component of its corporate culture. The WLA fully supports this recertification for IGT’s lottery operations and congratulates IGT on its continuing dedication to responsible gaming and corporate social responsibility.” Mélissa Azam, Senior Corporate Social Responsibility Manager, WLA</p>
<p>The WLA accreditation is the latest recognition of IGT’s continuous efforts and commitment to responsible gaming by following eight globally adopted guidelines, including collaboration with its Responsible Gaming Advisory Group, the introduction of e-learning courses for employees, corporate-wide responsible gaming policy made public, updating on a continuous basis its global Code of Principles related to advertising and marketing communications, and others.</p>
<p>Representing more than 150 state-authorized lotteries spanning across 6 continents and 80 countries, the WLA is always there for a good cause as funding for such initiatives is one of the basic criteria for WLA membership.</p>
<p>WLA member lotteries, including platinum contributor IGT, raise billions of dollars to fund projects and programs every year and have raised an estimated total of $1.3 trillion since 1999.</p>
