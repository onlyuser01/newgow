<p>MGM Resorts International has fulfilled a mission it first announced last month. It has launched MGM Rewards, its new loyalty rewards program. This will be the first time that non-gaming and gaming members can earn MGM Rewards points on a single platform. The points can be used to redeem for free dining, entertainment and hotel stay. They can also be connected to BetMGM’s online sports betting platform.</p>
<p>MGM Expands Loyalty Program</p>
<p>The new program will provide “unprecedented” access for gaming and non-gaming guests to more than 20 locations across the US. These resorts include ARIA, MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas; Borgata in Atlantic City; Beau Rivage in Mississippi; and MGM National Harbor in Maryland.</p>
<p>In a Tuesday press release, Anil Mansukhani, VP of Loyalty Marketing at MGM Resorts, stated that the unique rewards provide “significant incentives” for guests who achieve at all levels.</p>
<p>MGM Rewards’ launch also includes a simplified app that allows members to view their Tier status and benefit information and see how they can move up to the next level.</p>
<p>MGM Rewards Points can be redeemed for MGM Resorts’ complimentary entertainment, dining and hotel stays. Slot players have more opportunities to earn, as well, as they can receive MGM Rewards points and Slot Dollars. MGM Rewards points can now be earned by table games players at all MGM Reward destinations.</p>
<p>MGM Rewards MasterCard cardmembers earn more, as they now earn three points and three Tier credits for every dollar spent, two Tier credits and two points for each dollar spent on fuel or supermarket purchases and one Tier credit and one point for every dollar spent anywhere else.</p>
<p>Members can redeem MGM Rewards points or Slot Dollars. Pearl+ members have no currency expiration due to account inactivity. MGM Resorts now offers MGM Rewards points redemption and earning at over 400 food and beverage locations across its portfolio of properties.</p>
<p>BetMGM Customers Receive More Benefits</p>
<p>Sports betting fans can also convert their wagers into real-world experiences by earning Tier credits or BetMGM Rewards points for each wager placed on BetMGM’s sports betting app. With access to over 20 states in the US, BetMGM has quickly become one of the leading online sportsbooks in the country.</p>
<p>MGM Rewards MasterCard cardmembers will earn Tier credits or MGM MasterCard points if they use BetMGM to make deposits. These can then be used to redeem for an array of experiences at the operator’s land-based destinations.</p>
<p>Platinum+ members receive a Tier Achievement Travel Credit to Las Vegas-based on their 2022 spending. Additionally, all Pearl+ members are entitled to complimentary MGM Rewards concerts in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>MGM Rewards also offers partnership opportunities with top brands that offer tier-match benefits with Hyatt Hotels &amp; Resorts, as well as cruises with onboard loyalty benefits for Platinum+ members cruising on Celebrity Cruises and Royal Caribbean. World of Hyatt members can earn World of Hyatt rewards points for staying at any Las Vegas MGM Rewards destination. They can also continue to choose MGM Rewards Tier credits, or World of Hyatt Points for eligible spending at Hyatt properties.</p>
<p>To increase the number of customers enrolled in the MGM Rewards program, members are being given a 2x multiplier for Tier credits earned at MGM’s Las Vegas resorts between February 1 and April 30 at the new rates.</p>
