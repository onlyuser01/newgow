<p>Some of Playson’s Hold and Win Games will be available on TEP’s aggregation platform</p>
<p>Playson, a fast-growing supplier of online casino content, has announced a new partnership agreement with The Ear Platform (TEP), a rapidly growing certified aggregator that operates internationally.</p>
<p>Under the deal, many of Playson’s cutting-edge games will be integrated into TEP’s platform. As a result, TEP’s partnering operators will be able to add the developer’s newest titles into their offerings, allowing the supplier to reach more players than ever.</p>
<p>As agreed, Playson will supply famous Hold and Win Games to TEP, including hits such as 3 Pots Riches: Hold and Win, Coin Strike: Hold and Win and Energy Coins: Hold and Win.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Hold and Win series, a month ago Playson rolled out Wolf Land: Hold and Win, further expanding its industry-leading portfolio.</p>
<p>In addition, Playson will supply promotional tools to the aggregator, giving its clients and players a “chance to explore the provider’s best mechanics.”</p>
<p>TEP Is Glad to Expand Its Deal with Playson</p>
<p>TEP was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Milan, Italy. The company distributes best-in-class games from 130+ industry-leading developers. Playson’s robust mathematical models and captivating graphics made its games a perfect fit for TEP’s new branch, The Ear Casino.</p>
<p>The Ear Platform’s commercial director, Andrei Siomlea, commented on the new partnership. He praised Playson as a leading iGaming company and said that the supplier’s games are “the best choice” for any licensed online casino operator.</p>
<p>Siomlea added that his team is happy to onboard Playson’s outstanding games.</p>
<p>Playson’s games are loved by millions of users all over the world which is why there is no iGaming project that does not include Playson in its offer of providers and The Ear Platform is proud to market its important titles. Andrei Siomlea, commercial director, The Ear Platform</p>
<p>Playson’s chief operating officer, Vsevolod Lapin, also commented on the partnership. He said:</p>
<p>The Ear Platform’s API Aggregator is high-performing and rapidly expanding, and we are happy to collaborate with such a flexible company with increasingly broad growth prospects. Vsevolod Lapin, COO, Playson</p>
<p>Lapin concluded that the agreement would allow Playson to reach even more operators and players.</p>
<p>In other news, Playson recently grew its footprint in Switzerland by agreeing to supply content to Pasino, a leading local operator.</p>
