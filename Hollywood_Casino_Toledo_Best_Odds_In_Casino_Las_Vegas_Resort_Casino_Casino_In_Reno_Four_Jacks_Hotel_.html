    <h1>Hollywood Casino Toledo Best Odds In Casino Las Vegas Resort Casino Casino In Reno Four Jacks Hotel</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I made a deposit today, on 31.01.24, at Palmslot, amounting to $100!</p>
<p>I deposited using ONLINE BANKING INSTANT PAYMENT and the deposit process went smoothly.</p>
<p>For hours, the deposited money has not been credited to my account at Palmslot.</p>
<p>In my transaction list, the status still reads: PENDING!</p>
<p>Proof of deposit at the casino: #7378428533401684751</p>
<p>I have already asked twice in chat, and each time I'm told to wait, as some deposit methods always take a bit longer.</p>
<p>It's clear that the Chat Support can't offer any further help, apart from telling me to wait.</p>
<p>In the chat, I uploaded a screenshot as proof of my $100 deposit on 31.01.24.</p>
<p>Proof of my deposit is there at Palmslot, but a credit has not been made on my casino account.</p>
<p>The money was debited from my bank account within a few seconds.</p>
<p>Evidence is available (e.g., a screenshot).</p>
<p>However, the credit at Palmslot takes hours...or even longer (possibly days).</p>
<p>An email confirmation of a deposit from Palmslot has not been received even after hours.</p>
<p>If Palmslot does not book the deposit as credit, I want my money immediately returned to my bank account.</p>
<p>I can't afford to give away money.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>The deposit of $100 was from my bank account.</p>
<p>This deposit was WITHOUT a casino bonus.</p>
<p>So either I get $100 credited or refunded to my bank account.</p>
<p>Note for Casino Guru:</p>
<p>I can't upload attachments here, not as a single file nor as a PDF file!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>MrW</p>
