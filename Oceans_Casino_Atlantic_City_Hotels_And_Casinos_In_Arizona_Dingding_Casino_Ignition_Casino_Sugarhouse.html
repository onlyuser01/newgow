    <h1>Oceans Casino Atlantic City Hotels And Casinos In Arizona Dingding Casino Ignition Casino Sugarhouse</h1>

<p>Setup an account and made a $25 litecoin deposit and took a $50 bonus. Read that I had a 30x's play through and went in my history and made sure I had that covered I tried to cash out it wouldn't let me. Contacted support and was told I had not bet enough. After asking about 6 times finally got a number I was short, which doing the math came to 35 X's through which I was above that, went back not once but twice and still wasn't enough. Got told something about slots and I said I only played blackjack and was told then those bets only count a third. I finally got past that. When I signed up there was about 10 ways to deposit. When I tried to withdraw there was 1. When I tried to withdraw there was a $50 charge to withdraw. I was over and was ready to be done with them. Then option I was given would not work in my area. I contacted support again and was td Skrill is what I had to use and there was nothing stopping me from using that. I go back and Skrill doesn't come up as an option. This had been 5 hours trying to withdraw and I was done. Tried again the next day and still got the run around and more lies. I was then told that to withdraw with Skrill I had to make another deposit using Skrill. There was no way in hell I was making another deposit. I ask about getting paid in Litecoin like I deposited with. Their rules state you have to withdrawal the same way you deposit. I was told that wasn't an option in my area. It sure the hell was when I made my deposit. Then I was told I had to submit my documents and after they were verified I could withdraw. I submitted my documents. This was 3 more hours I spent and still had gotten no where. I checked the next day and my account was closed. I sent several emails asking what the deal was with no response. I called and got told basically they closed my account and were not paying me. Since I was unable to get back in with my account I created another to find out who their ADR is. From my understanding they are suppose to have this information made available. I could not find it. I have emailed them asking for it with no response back. 8 hours over 2 days I got the run around and just lied to. Numerous options to make a deposit but only 1 that wasn't available in my area to withdraw. I want what I won a if they are able to receive crypto there should be no reason they can't send crypto. I have screenshots that prove what I am saying.</p>
