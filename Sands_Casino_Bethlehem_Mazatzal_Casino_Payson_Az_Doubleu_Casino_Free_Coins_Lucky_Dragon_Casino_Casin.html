    <h1>Sands Casino Bethlehem Mazatzal Casino Payson Az Doubleu Casino Free Coins Lucky Dragon Casino Casin</h1>

<p>The Super Group-owned betting and gaming operator has expanded its portfolio of ambassadors with the addition of Peter Stringer</p>
<p>Stringer is an ex-scrum half who is well-versed in the rugby ecosystem and makes a great addition to Betway’s team, which has been focusing on rugby more and more, especially now with the Rugby World Cup in France due to get underway on Friday, September 8.</p>
<p>Welcoming One of Rugby’s Finest Experts</p>
<p>Stringer will promote knowledge and insights from the world of rugby, and he will also be penning blog posts to help fans keep their hand on the beating pulse of the game and understand the sport through the eyes of a former professional athlete.</p>
<p>All materials will be published in the Betway Insider section. Stringer himself has made 98 appearances in Rugby, competing for his country, and has participated in two world cups. He won a Six Nations Grand Slam in 2009 and holds three Triple Crowns along with two Heineken Cups.</p>
<p>He is also the latest of a string of other prominent athletes to join the Betway ambassador team, which now includes ex-soccer pro-Robbie Keane and cricket player Kevin Pietersen. Arsenal similarly secured an ambassador partnership with former tennis pro-Andy Roddick just recently.</p>
<p>Naturally, Stringer was excited to be joining and be a part of one of the biggest and best-established sports betting and gaming brands. “I look forward to helping rugby fans garner valuable insights with my thoughts on the game’s biggest tournaments, starting with the biggest of all, the World Cup,” he noted.</p>
<p>Stringer noted that he will provide actionable and valuable insights to audiences, drawing on his decade-long experience in the sport, and his lifelong passion for rugby.</p>
<p>Betway Keeps Adding Momentum in Sports</p>
<p>Betway was similarly pleased to see the prominent athlete join the team with Betway CEO Anthony Werkman giving Stringer a warm welcome and arguing that his opinion and valuable insights would be truly appreciated by the Betway sports fandom.</p>
<p>Betway remains a force to reckon with in sports betting as the company partnered up with Arsenal, a Premier League club, to become the team’s Official Global Betting Partner. Betway has been focusing more and more on other sports, looking closely into rugby, tennis, cricket, and other worthwhile athletic competitions that are now also getting more interest from sports fans and bettors.</p>
<p>Betway and Stringer will continue to follow the principles of responsible gambling in everything they do and promote safe gambling messages across the brand’s network.</p>
