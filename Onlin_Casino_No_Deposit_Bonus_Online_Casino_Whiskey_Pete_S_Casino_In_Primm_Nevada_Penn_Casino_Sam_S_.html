<p>Oddin.gg, an esports data and odds provider, has appointed Juana Bischoff on its board of directors. She will be stepping in as senior business development manager. The new executive will be instrumental for the company’s further success in developing what Oddin has described as its end-to-end esports betting system.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg Strengthens Team with Juana Bischoff</p>
<p>Bischoff has 12 years of experience working in related positions and sectors. She spent three years working with Bayes Esports, one of the most prominent esports data companies which is partner with Riot Games and delivers data-driven esports insights.</p>
<p>She held various positions as part of Bayes Esports, including director of global accounts and director of sales and head of sales. Commenting on her appointment, Bischoff said:</p>
<p>Collaborating closely with customers is always a key part of a successful relationship and my main approach. Understanding and providing the best solutions to support them in their strategic growth ambitions drives me every day. Oddin.gg senior business development manager Juana Bischoff</p>
<p>She confirmed that joining Oddin.gg was an important opportunity for her as she seeks to contribute and help the company build best-in-class solutions. Bischoff will help operators better understand the esports sector and its overall importance.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg co-founder and MD of partnerships Marek Suchar welcomed her appointment. He said that more operators are exploring the esports betting space these days, but they still need to be guided. “Juana will be a valuable member of the team to help further educate the market on esports topics,” Suchar assured.</p>
<p>Help Operators Understand Esports Better</p>
<p>Suchar is confident that Bischoff will help Oddin.gg establish strong grassroots and mutually beneficial relationships with the industry for years to come. Oddin.gg is not the only mover into the esports betting space.</p>
<p>Just recently, Abios and BETER teamed up to provide even more eBasketball and eSoccer content. Earlier this week, William Hill appointed PandaScore, an established provider of esports data and feeds, as its official Esports Betting Supplier.</p>
