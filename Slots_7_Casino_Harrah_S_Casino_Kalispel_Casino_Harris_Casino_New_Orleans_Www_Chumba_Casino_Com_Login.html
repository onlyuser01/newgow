<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>Now I remember, my sister in law who has an account on BC, introduced my disabled father in law to BC. He's disable because he had a stroke, everytime he goes to login he can't remember how to login and would create or login using Google or telegram or whatever he does to be able to login. Joe, that's the main guy there at BC.GAME, he's the one that gives it a go or not, he should remember my sister in law, "Pa- The chosen one". Joe is aware of my father in law's condition. Now that I recalled that's the cause for the multiple accounts. And about the balance on those accounts, yes all the balance on those accounts are at zero dollars. Honest truth and a man of my words, I only have one account, only one. I'm not sure what BC.GAME is scaming here but I'm positive I'm not the first and won't be the last. I know that I haven't done nothing wrong to put my account at risk except for making deposits. I would admit that I was wrong in not reading the terms and conditions but I hope BC.GAME know that scaming US players by restricting their account after winnings just cause they're from US but allowing them to create accounts and make thousands of dollars worth of deposits then not wanting to pay them out for their winnings are alot worst then my disable father in law trying to play on BC. If this issue is not resolve in our next conversation, I'm going to have to seek further actions. There's players on BC.GAME that would vouch for me, for themselves and for others they know shit like this has happened to before. Jeo, the shot caller, his own buddies and workers will vouch as well, 2k pocket change for them.</p>
<p>Again Thank you Adam for understanding me and the frustrations BC has caused,</p>
<p>Banee</p>
