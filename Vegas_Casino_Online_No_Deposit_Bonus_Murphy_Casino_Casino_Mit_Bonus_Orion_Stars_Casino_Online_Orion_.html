<p>A new investigation led by Professor Richard McLaren discovered that boxing bouts during the 2016 Rio Olympics were impacted by match-fixing. The investigation was initiated by the International Boxing Association and found malpractices conducted by judges and referees.</p>
<p>Boxing Integrity Impacted during 2016 Olympics According to an Investigation</p>
<p>Results of a new investigation were released this past Thursday. They revealed that some boxing fights during the 2016 Rio Olympics were fixed. AIBA, the International Boxing Association, appointed Professor Richard McLaren to conduct an independent investigation into boxing. McLaren, who was recently interviewed by the Associated Press, said that referees, as well as judges, participated in the match-fixing.</p>
<p>Although the investigation did not reveal how many fights had been impacted by the fraud, McLaren said that there may be around 11 or fewer. Here, it’s important to mention that the investigation found fights that have been manipulated or are suspected of being fixed. Some of those fights even included fights for medals, according to the investigator.</p>
<p>Key personnel decided that the rules did not apply to them.” Investigator Richard McLaren</p>
<p>The match-fixing was conducted via a “culture of fear, intimidation and obedience in the ranks of the referees and judges,” outlined McLaren. With the help of this “informal structure,” select referees and judges were assigned to specific fights to ensure that the outcome was manipulated. Here, McLaren said that either those judges were participating in the structure or were incompetent and unwilling to report the improprieties.</p>
<p>During the probe into the 2016 Olympics, the investigator concluded that judges and referees who held key positions considered that the rules do not apply for them. Besides the 2016 Olympics, McLaren revealed that the 2012 London Olympics may have also been affected by the match-fixing scheme.</p>
