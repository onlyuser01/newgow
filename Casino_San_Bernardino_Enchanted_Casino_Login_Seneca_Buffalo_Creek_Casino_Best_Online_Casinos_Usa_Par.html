<p>Raketech will continue streamlining and optimizing its business as it plans to focus on key products in 2023</p>
<p>Raketech published its financial results for the final quarter of 2022, highlighting its performance. The company experienced good organic growth and recorded record-breaking revenues.</p>
<p>Revenues for the period sat at $16.7 million (converted to USD) thanks to the performance of Raketech’s core portfolio of affiliation marketing. Revenues from the United States increased to $2.45 million, while overall sports revenues totaled $4.5 million, or 26.7% of the company’s total revenues for the period.</p>
<p>Organic growth amounted to 23.1%, driven by an increase in affiliation and sub-affiliation revenues. Adjusted EBITDA, meanwhile, amounted to $6.7 million with the adjusted EBITDA margin being somewhat lower than last year at 40.3%.</p>
<p>Raketech’s board proposed a dividend of EUR 0.094 per share to be distributed to shareholders.</p>
<p>Following the publication of its Q4 results, Raketech also released details about its performance in January 2023. During the first month of the year, the company recorded revenues of $5.3 million. The company also highlighted the addendum it recently entered for the acquisition of Casumba Media. The payment is payable in installments of up to $16 million throughout 2024. Any remaining amount can be deferred up until September 16, 2026, Raketech informed readers.</p>
<p>Raketech Hopes to Maintain Its Momentum</p>
<p>Following the publishing of its 2022 results, Raketech also posted its 2023 guidance. The company’s board has decided to replace the targets with near-term guidance for revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow.</p>
<p>The company expects revenues of around $64-69 million in 2023, driven by strategic growth initiatives. Raketech also expects an EBITDA of around $21-$25.5, as well as operational costs of $2.1 million.</p>
<p>The company also noted that it expects free cash flow to increase substantially to around $12-14 million by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Mühlbach Happy with the Results</p>
<p>Oskar Mühlbach, Raketech’s chief executive officer, commented on the results, saying that he is very satisfied with the company’s performance in Q4 2022.</p>
<p>Our core affiliation assets are performing according to plan or better, including those handed over to us after earn-out periods. With our diversified portfolio within Affiliation marketing, Sub-affiliation and Betting Tips &amp; Subscriptions, we believe we are well-positioned to capture the many opportunities presented by the rapidly growing global digital gambling market. Oskar Mühlbach, CEO, Raketech</p>
<p>Mühlbach added that he was very pleased to see the company’s US revenues more than double year-on-year.</p>
<p>In 2023, Raketech will focus on its flagship products, Mühlbach said. He noted that fewer but better consumer products will provide his company with the advantage it needs.</p>
