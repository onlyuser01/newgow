<p>Gaming technology provider EveryMatrix announced today it opened a new commercial hub in Miami, Florida, to facilitate its expansion into the US and Latin American markets.</p>
<p>“Entering the US market is one of our major objectives this year and having feet on the ground there is essential.” Ebbe Groes, Group CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Expansion Continues</p>
<p>The B2B technology supplier for the iGaming industry which was established in 2008, currently has presence in 9 countries, Malta, Romania, Spain, Ukraine, Armenia, China, Norway, Thailand and now the USA, as well as more than 530 people on payroll.</p>
<p>“Opening up EveryMatrix’s Miami office marks a new era of the company’s success story. We have the industry’s most complete offering from microservices to full turnkey platform, sports, casino, and everything in between.” Eric Nyman, President, Americas, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Located in Downtown Miami in the Brickell area, the new hub led by industry veteran Eric Nyman will be coordinating EveryMatrix’s efforts in LATAM and US jurisdictions to establish the technology company as a trusted regional supplier.</p>
<p>“The product strength and future roadmap make me confident that we will break new ground in the Americas. We are building our team in Miami and are excited to further engage with customers and will announce several market entries in the coming months.” Eric Nyman, President, Americas, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Nyman who boasts more than 10 years of experience in the iGaming industry and joined the technology company in August 2020, will be tasked with oversight of the team’s commercial activity, recruitment of new talent and initiation of US customer acquisition.</p>
<p>“I’m confident that Erik will give shape to EveryMatrix’s US ambitions and drive forward this expansion process with a lot of dedication. I’m looking forward to bringing on-board brilliant people in our Miami office and I wish Erik and his team good luck.” Ebbe Groes, Group CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>New Jersey License Application</p>
<p>In November 2020, EveryMatrix chose New Jersey as its entry point for the fast developing online gaming market in the US and filed for a license with the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE), looking to license its CasinoEngine iGaming aggregator platform.</p>
<p>Earlier in February, EveryMatrix expanded an agreement with esports-first operator Luckbox, dating back to 2019, when Luckbox launched esports betting via EveryMatrix’s competitive sportsbook platform OddsMatrix. Having achieved success and increased popularity among bettors on esports markets, Luckbox decided to enhance its offering by a selected range of live sports provided by EveryMatrix.</p>
