<p>Players who are already familiar with the original game’s graphic designs will automatically be reminded of it while also spotting the fresh aesthetics added to the sequel.</p>
<p>As the Mega Don makes an appearance, you will also get to witness a few of his companions, including the Leopard Shark and Hammerhead while spinning the reels on the 5×4 grid and slot trying to create winning combos using the available symbols.</p>
<p>While you are at it, look for valuable deep-sea features born from the chaos including the Snack Time bonus that can be triggered anytime while engaged in the base game.</p>
<p>One to three standard symbols will be selected to turn into one of the higher-paying shark symbols, eventually expanding while filling up on the tasty treat.</p>
<p>Players who land at least three Scatters can get ready to serve the main course during the Free Spins Shark Feast round. Select one of the three available sharks to take the lead.</p>
<p>Each shark features a certain number of Free Spins that will pop up on the reels during the round.</p>
<p>Sink Your Teeth Into the Free Spins</p>
<p>Players who opt for the Leopard Shark receive the highest number of Free Spins at 10, followed by eight Free Spins for the Hammerhead and six Free Spins via the Mega Don.</p>
<p>The same selected shark will turn into stacked symbols across the reels, further boosting your chances of scoring more big wins. The same feature can be retriggered with additional Scatter symbols up to a maximum of 20 Free Spins.</p>
<p>Mega Don Feeding Frenzy joins Play’n GO’s wide selection of sea slots and animal slots. Titles such as Sea Hunter, Octopus Treasure, and the first Mega Don title have become incredibly popular among fans of sea slots.</p>
<p>Talking about the fresh release, Play’n GO’s games ambassador, Magnus Wallentin, explained that they are constantly interested in “breathing new life” into their beloved titles so they can provide fans with something that is both familiar and brand new.</p>
<p>Last week, the studio announced the release of Gargantoonz, another exciting expansion of its iconic Reactoonz IP series. At the beginning of October, Play’n GO inked a strategic agreement with BeyondPlay.</p>
