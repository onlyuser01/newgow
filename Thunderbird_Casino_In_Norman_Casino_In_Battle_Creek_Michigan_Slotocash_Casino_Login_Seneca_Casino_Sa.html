<p>Following a successful trial during the NFL season, Kambi is launching cash out for pre-game BetBuilder bets for Super Bowl LVII</p>
<p>Supplier of sports betting technology Kambi announced that pre-match BetBuilder bets will be available for live cash out for the first time during Super Bowl LVII.</p>
<p>Raise Excitement during Super Bowl Sunday</p>
<p>The launch of the new feature that will allow players to cash out a large majority of pre-game BetBuilder bets live was introduced alongside new in-game functionality as Kambi is looking to raise the level of excitement for bettors for the event that is expected to rank among the biggest of all time betting-wise.</p>
<p>“The Super Bowl is always one of the highlights of the sporting calendar and with the immense popularity of Bet Builder, it was important for Kambi to continue to improve its market-leading product in time for Super Bowl LVII,” commented Simon Noy, senior vice president of Trading at Kambi.</p>
<p>BetBuilder accounted for approximately 30% of all pre-game bets on the Kambi network during the regular season in the NFL, making same- and multi-game parlays a must-have for sportsbook operators, and the addition of the cash-out and in-game functionalities is expected to enhance further the BetBuilder product and its lure to players.</p>
<p>“Kambi has been consistently ahead of the market with its premium Bet Builder product and the launch of cash out and live functionality was the next logical step in the product’s evolution,” added Noy, looking forward to the moment when these new features will be rolled out “across other sports and leagues in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Encouraging Player Response during Trial</p>
<p>The new cash-out and in-play functionalities went through a successful trial during the NFL Playoffs during which the cashing out of BetBuilder in-game bets reached two-thirds of the level of single bets, convincing Kambi that bettors liked the feature.</p>
<p>Kambi, which recently won the EGR B2B Award for “Innovation in Sports Betting Software,” will allow bettors this weekend to place BetBuilder bets live and cash out their pre-game or in-game BetBuilder bets during any stage of the game. The new BetBuilder features will be available for combinations made up of main bet offers.</p>
<p>Kambi is planning to extend the cash-out functionality to additional markets in time for the next NFL season, as well as to various other sports and leagues, including the MLB, NBA, March Madness and others, over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Available as a core feature of Kambi’s sportsbook or as a standalone solution, BetBuilder is aimed at enhancing the user experience and is currently live for baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and soccer.</p>
