<p>JPMorgan Forecasts US Micro-Betting Boom</p>

<p>A team of JPMorgan analysts led by Daniel Politzer say micro-betting is shaping up to be the next big thing in sports betting.</p>

<p>Micro bets are derivatives of in-game counterparts. With an in-game or live wager, a bettor places a traditional wager — money line, over/under or spread — with odds adjusted for the fact that the game already started. Conversely, a micro wager is a bet on a specific in-game event, say whether or not a field goal attempt in a football game will be successful, or whether the next pitch in a baseball tilt will be a ball or strike.</p>
<p>While live wagering is popular in Europe, the pace of many popular domestic sports is conducive to micro-betting. Live wagering accounts for 75 percent of all sports bets in the UK.</p>
<p>Given the accommodating cadence of US sports with numerous play stoppages in football, baseball, and basketball, versus the continually running clock in soccer, the in-game/micro-betting opportunity could be substantial,” said Politzer in a note to clients.</p>
<p>The analyst sees various forms of live betting driving upside to his forecast of a US sports wagering market valued at $9.25 billion by 2025. That’s a reserved estimate relative to other projections. For example, DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) recently said domestic online sports betting could eventually be worth $22 billion, assuming 100 percent legalization.</p>
<p>Micro-Betting Big Implications</p>
<p>Live wagering is already catching an eye within the industry. For example, Australia’s PointsBet (OTC:PBTHF), which also operates in the US, said earlier this week it’s paying $43 million to acquire Banach Technology in a move aimed at bolstering its in-game footprint.</p>
<p>While the JPMorgan analysts don’t go into detail regarding specific stocks poised to benefit from the proliferation of micro-betting, it’s reasonable to surmise the list features the usual suspects with an already sizable share of the US online sports betting market. Those names include DraftKings, Flutter Entertainment’s (OTC:PDYPY) FanDuel business, and Penn National Gaming’s (NASDAQ:PENN) Barstool Sportsbook, among others.</p>
<p>DraftKings CEO Jason Robbins has spoken publicly about the opportunity-rich field of live wagering and some operators are already teasing the micro concept. For example, FanDuel partnered with Simplebet on a free-to-play game during the 2020 NFL season where users attempted to predict the outcomes of teams’ drives. Simplebet is a business-to-business product-development company.</p>
<p>Future fuboTV Predictions</p>
<p>Should the micro-wagering market blossom on par with the bull thesis laid out by JPMorgan, there are other possible winners.</p>
<p>Notably, fuboTV (NYSE:FUBO) could eventually become a force in the in-game, event-driven market. In fact, some of the company’s biggest investors say that’s part of the thesis that underpins this stock.</p>
<p>With a regional sports networks (RSNs) deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group and extensive sports wagering operational experience of its own, Bally’s Corp. (NYSE:BALY) is another company that could benefit as micro-betting takes off.</p>
