    <h1>Casino Hotels In Phoenix Az Hard Rock Hotel Casino Tulsa San Diego Casinos Casino In Green Bay Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Stamatina,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am afraid my question has not been answered completely.</p>
<p>Please note if the casino offers only non-redeemable bonuses, it means that considering the rule stated above, the bonus funds would have been deducted from your winnings upon processing a withdrawal, which could not have been done. So, it seems that at the time you played restricted games, the bonus funds were still part of your balance, so the bonus rules still applied to your winnings, which complicates the situation significantly.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to review your game history and all the details. So, let's ask the casino for clarification and relevant data.</p>
<p>Dear PrimaPlay Casino team,</p>
<p>Could you please provide us with an explanation of the player's situation in more detail? Why have the disputed winnings been confiscated?</p>
<p>What were the values of the deposit and the deposit bonus in question? Is there a chance that you could also provide me with the specific bonus terms and conditions for the deposit bonus used? Do I understand correctly that the casino allows players to play restricted games after meeting the wagering requirements and converting the winnings to withdrawable balance? If yes, are players informed about continuing bonus rules applying to these funds until a withdrawal is fully processed? Do players know that they have to request a withdrawal of such funds or that they have to withdraw and deposit them back to continue playing?</p>
<p>If we are talking about a breach of the casino's Terms and Conditions, is the casino able to substantiate its decision with relevant evidence? It would be highly appreciated if we could look at the player's game logs.</p>
<p>Feel free to use my email address for a response (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for providing the information.</p>
