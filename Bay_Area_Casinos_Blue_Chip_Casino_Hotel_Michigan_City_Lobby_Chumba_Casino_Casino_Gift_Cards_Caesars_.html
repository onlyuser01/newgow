<p>Columbus Crew Ready for War</p>
<p>After finishing the regular season in the No. 3 position in the East, Columbus went on to knock out Atlanta United out of the playoffs after three games.</p>
<p>Then, in the conference semifinal, they beat Orlando City 2-0 after extra time. It was 0-0 in the regular 90 minutes, with the team from Florida playing with 10 men after one of their players got sent off.</p>
<p>You gotta be in the right spot to score goals.</p>

<p>The Eastern Conference Final too saw two extra times. Columbus drew 2-2 with FC Cincinnati in regulation and then went on to score the winner in the 115th minute.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s interesting about that game is that the Crew were 2-0 down until the 75th minute when one of Cincyâ€™s players scored an own goal. Then, just four minutes before the end of the 90 minutes of regular play, Diego Rossi scored the equalizer.</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC to Show Why Theyâ€™re Champions</p>
<p>LAFC won last seasonâ€™s MLS Cup thanks to a vintage goal scored by legendary Gareth Bale. The Welshman, however, is no longer playing soccer professionally. However, thereâ€™s a new star in town.</p>
<p>Denis Bouanga is LAFCâ€™s superstar in 2023. The Gabonese striker is the winner of the MLS Golden Boot for being the top scorer in the regular season. Heâ€™s been equally productive since the start of the playoffs, scoring in three of LAFCâ€™s four playoff games.</p>
<p>He didnâ€™t score in the Western Conference Final, but his team was still able to beat Houston Dynamo 2-0. Whatâ€™s interesting is that it was LAFCâ€™s third straight game in which they kept a clean sheet. Can they make it a fourth?</p>
<p>Columbus Crew vs. LAFC Prediction</p>
<p>Columbus Crew is a team thatâ€™s fun to watch. These guys attack with all theyâ€™ve got and theyâ€™re not afraid of conceding goals. So far, itâ€™s worked for them, but we suspect this strategy might not go well on Saturday. The thing is that theyâ€™re playing against a team thatâ€™s simply better than them.</p>
<p>With Bouanga in top shape, LAFC are guaranteed to score some goals in the 2023 MLS Cup. And with their defense playing at an elite level, they should be able to repel Columbusâ€™ charges at their goal.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles FC</p>
