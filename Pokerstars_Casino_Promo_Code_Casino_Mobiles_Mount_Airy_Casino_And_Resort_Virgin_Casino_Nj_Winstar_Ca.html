    <h1>Pokerstars Casino Promo Code Casino Mobiles Mount Airy Casino And Resort Virgin Casino Nj Winstar Ca</h1>

<p>Update: after Day 17</p>
<p>-so far not one answer to my e-mails (to all possible destinations)....</p>
<p>-in chat is some activity. Marina, Tyler, Jackson.</p>
<p>two, three times they've stalled me. We are in the process of checking it out etc.... blah blah...nothing happened.</p>
<p>I think they ignore me from now on. When i am logged in, they dont talkt to me. I try it 3 times today. No reaction. When i go to chat incognito and ask for Deposit Help, they help immediately in one second.</p>
<p>Attached a screenshot. As I said before, everything is designed for deposit. Withdrawal is blocked.</p>
<p>-Juan has the function "Do not disturb" on. So, he gets no message on instagram</p>
<p>@Radka</p>
<p>I respect your opinion on the subject of fraud or not. Please also respect my view. You seem to see it only in black or white. Payout no, or payout yes. It's not that simple.</p>
<p>what they are doing is a Ponzi scheme. If free money comes in, maybe some will go out....with good luck. If it's not a scam, then anyone here in the forum can give me 100€ and you Radka will be the last. Your 100€ will only be returned if a new idiot pays in after you. That way, I'm always on the winning track. Of which, very few win and only 0.001% last 3 months.</p>
<p>i want to protect people! If it was just about my ass, I wouldn't have to do anything and hope that more people would pay in! Perfidious system!</p>
