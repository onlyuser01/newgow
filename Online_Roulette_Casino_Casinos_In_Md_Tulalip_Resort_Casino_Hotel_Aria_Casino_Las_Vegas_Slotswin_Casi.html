<p>Epoxy a company that specializes in ML and AI personalization will now work with betPARX through its SmartPicks solutions that will help the company significantly strengthen its ability to appeal to players</p>
<p>Personalization has become an important part of the overall experience at sportsbooks that are vying for market share in a highly-competitive and very costly market all across the United States.</p>
<p>Bringing AI and MI to Build a Sounder Betting Experience</p>
<p>To get ahead and secure a noticeable advantage, companies need to turn to solutions such as the ones offered by Epoxy.ai, with the company now strengthening betPARX’s own ability to strike home with its audiences and create tailored propositions and products that appeal to sports bettors and fans based on their preferences.</p>
<p>Players get recommendations in real-time and have an enjoyable and worthwhile experience that will be based on their preferences. Epoxy.ai co-founder and CEO Chris Reynolds has welcomed the launch of the service and said:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to extend our relationship with betPARX and take our SmartPicks offering live for the first time. Epoxy.ai co-founder and CEO Chris Reynolds</p>
<p>Part of the solutions that Epoxy.ai offers is a more “simplified and personalized experience” which is precisely what sports fans and bettors are after. Reynolds is confident that AI and ML solutions can deliver the transformative betting experience that customers are after.</p>
<p>Taking the product live with betPARX is an opportunity to demonstrate this and help Epoxy expand in the United States but also redefine the success formula for sportsbooks in the country.</p>
<p>betPARX SVP of iGaming and sports Matthew Cullen was similarly pleased with the partnership. “We’re thrilled to extend our relationship with betPARX and take our SmartPicks offering live for the first time,” Cullen added.</p>
<p>betPARX Committed to Stay Innovative</p>
<p>He confirmed that betPARX considers itself a forward-thinking operator and as such the company is happy to be adding AI and ML solutions to strengthen the experiences for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Epoxy.ai has been rapidly scaling up its offer, launching in the United States, Europe, and Canada with more rollouts in those targeted markets to follow. This follows up on a similar partnership between the two companies back in 2022 when betPARX launched the Sparx content tab.</p>
