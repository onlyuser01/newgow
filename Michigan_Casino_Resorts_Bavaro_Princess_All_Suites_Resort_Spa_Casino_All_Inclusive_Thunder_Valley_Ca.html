<p>BETBY, a Malta-based sportsbook software and platform provider, has grown its LatAm presence, rolling out its complete solution through a partnership with JuegaEnLinea.</p>
<p>BETBY Extends Reach in Latin America</p>
<p>With the new partnership, JuegaEnLinea customers from Latin America will gain access to BETBY’s complete solution. The provider offers over 600,000 live sports events annually. JuegaEnLinea will use the provider’s latest layout, which offers a high-quality user experience, with customization widgets and pins for players.</p>
<p>BETBY CEO Leonid Pertsovskiy said that the company is delighted to take its complete collection to JuegaEnLinea and extend its reach to countries like Venezuela, Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. He said that the company looks for new exciting markets and finds and sees this opportunity to boost its presence in LatAm. The deal marks one of the first times BETBY’s new sportsbook layout going live with a customer.</p>
<p>BETBY’s Latest Expansion in 2021</p>
<p>BETBY will provide its AI-led esports collection, Betby.Games. Its titles cover a wide range of sports from soccer to tennis, basketball, and some more unique offers, such as Rocket League, and more. The agreement is the latest BETBY expansion in 2021. The company is keeping its moment, as it recently integrated with Starfish Media, Betmaster, and others. The provider is looking forward to expanding its presence worldwide.</p>
<p>JuegaEnLinea’s General Manager Jhorvis Perez said that BETBY offers everything the operator could desire. Besides its cutting-edge product collection, Betby.Games’ range will provide JuegaEnLinea a unique offering to attract more customers. Perez said that the company anticipates the results from the new partnership.</p>
<p>UX-focused Functionality Upgrades</p>
<p>Recently, BETBY announced its series of UX-focused functionality upgrades. Designed to boost the quality of the site’s interface, the new features provide a better user experience and engagement. The provider said that it has “reimagined all engagement components of the standard layouts.”</p>
<p>The new improvements include a sidebar menu for instant options on popular markets, which reduces the player navigation to 1-to-2 clicks.</p>
<p>The provider’s goal is to provide innovative customization to players. Now it delivers a fully responsive interface, easy betslip placements, and simplified on-site navigation. All of these new features enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>For BETBY, these upgrades are fundamental for its product enhancement and technological innovation along with its 24/7 AI-powered esports inventory.</p>
<p>According to the customer feedback, the betslip pin allows punters to pin their preferable bets.</p>
