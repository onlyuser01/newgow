    <h1>Hardrock Casino Tampa Casino In St Louis Missouri Coeur Dalene Casino Sevenwinds Casino River Casino</h1>

<p>GambleAware, a charity based in the United Kingdom seeking to address the problems brought on by excessive gambling, has been determined to lead by example. Since 2022, the charity has used its Lived Experience Council (LEC) in a bid to connect with vulnerable communities, show them empathy, understanding, and a way out of reckless gambling.</p>
<p>The LEC is deemed as "pivotal" in the charity’s strategy to help reach out to people who are struggling with gambling-related harm and addiction, or who have been impacted by the problem gambling behavior of someone they know.</p>
<p>As such, the Council focuses on bringing in young people who can speak from experience and use their personal stories – both of sliding into gambling and redeeming – as examples of how others can tackle their own problem gambling.</p>
<p>The Council presently consists of 12 members, which includes the Chair, but is currently missing two people. For this to change, GambleAware is hoping to find two new members who meet a set of criteria that is aligned with the project’s broader ambitions and targets.</p>
<p>The two individuals should come from groups that have been known to be disproportionately impacted by problem gambling. GambleAware listed some of the criteria, asking that it wants to add individuals of the age group 18-25. GambleAware is also looking for Welsh residents and members of a minority group – whether this is based on language, an ethnic or religious minority.</p>
<p>Individuals with a disability or members of socially excluded groups are welcomed. The reason why GambleAware is so specific about the pick of LEC members is that the charity has solid data that shows such groups are more likely to struggle with gambling, but also – to get less support.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent attempt to bring more members to the Lived Experience Council, Chair Ben Howard said that he personally was excited to drive change through the project and thanked GambleAware for the support.</p>
<p>"We have made great strides since forming and are excited to engage and welcome two new members to assist us in this vital work going forward and we hope to see a representation of all communities on the Council," Howard explained. He also said that GambleAware is fully committed to having the voices of people struggling with gambling harm heard.
