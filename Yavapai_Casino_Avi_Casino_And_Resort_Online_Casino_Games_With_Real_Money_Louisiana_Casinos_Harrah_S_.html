<p>Madrid officials have decided to expand the La Contrapartida program to make sure that it covers more districts and prevents young people from developing a gambling addiction. La Contrapartida, which translates to “Counterpart” was created two years ago and it was available in four districts.</p>
<p>The Main Objective Is to Raise Awareness Connected to the Risk of Gambling</p>
<p>Inmaculada Sanz, a Security, and Emergencies of the City Council delegate announced on Thursday (April 7) a two-year contract that will keep Counterpart going, has been authorized. Hence, Counterpart will expand in Villaverde, Centro, San Blas-Canillejas, Ciudad Lineal, Puente de Vallecas, Moratalaz and Vicálvaro.</p>
<p>This program is a segment of Madrid’s Strategy for Attention and Prevention of Gambling Addiction (SAPGA) and the local government will fund it with $1.3 million.</p>
<p>SAPGA, on the other hand, is part of the Municipal Strategy for the Care and Prevention of Gambling Addiction program, which establishes connections between different municipal areas and helps prevent the risk of developing a gambling addiction. It also offers gambling addiction care and has resources to protect youth from gambling harm.</p>
<p>Counterpart Has Shown Great Success since Its Creation</p>
<p>While speaking about what Counterpart brings to the table, Sanz stated that the program has been the best proposal for preventing gambling disorder as it focuses on intervention for people that are in need of help.</p>
<p>Apart from the local Madrid government, the state government remains active in making sure that the gambling ecosystem is balanced. In January, it announced a review of the rules concerning responsible gambling and wanted the public to have a more active role in the process of creating guidelines that can be used in Spain’s autonomous regions.</p>
<p>Currently, Spain is ranked as one of Europe’s top countries when it comes to being effective in solving gambling harm. The gambling rate in this country is below 1%, but it wasn’t always like that. In 2019, a shared report from Madrid’s Association of Psychologists and the Federation of Rehabilitated Gamblers of Spain stated that one in every 5 teens between 14 and 21 in the country are dealing with gambling addiction problems.</p>
<p>An additional national survey that year concluded that 6.7% of the population between 15 and 64 was experiencing gambling harm. However, a Carlos III University survey in 2020 revealed that the rate dropped to 0.25% and the authorities claim that by constantly updating the programs on gambling addiction and responsible gambling, the rate will stay low.</p>
<p>Authorities are also making sure that the industry as a whole is safe. Back in February this year, Spanish police shut down a massive criminal organization that offered illegal gambling services among other things.</p>
