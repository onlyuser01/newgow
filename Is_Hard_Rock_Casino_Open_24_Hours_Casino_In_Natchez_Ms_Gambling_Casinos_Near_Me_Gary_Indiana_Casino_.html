    <h1>Is Hard Rock Casino Open 24 Hours Casino In Natchez Ms Gambling Casinos Near Me Gary Indiana Casino</h1>

<p>I am familiar with the terms and conditions and I did everything right.</p>
<p>I don't take deposit bonuses. I deposit cash and play with cash because i like to play the tournaments and some cost money. I deposited $30.00 on 6/8/23 and while playing, I hit a jackpot for over $2000.00. Funny cause I always thought they were a myth, but I really hit one. With those funds I played various games including some tournaments. I decided to cash some out before I lose it. I requested a withdrawal on 6/13/23 of $1000.00. None of that was winnings from tournaments it was all legit. They requested documents from me and I provided. License and payment cards and utility bill. I waited and</p>
<p>waited. I received an email from Calvin who requested my utility bill on 6/27/23. I provided and he said everything looks good. I contacted live chat on 6/29/23 and was told my withdrawal was denied. I was on chat for about an hour while they tried to come up with some excuse not to pay me. Finally they said I mixed funds. I don't know what that means but how can you help it and I didn't read that in the terms. Anyway, I requested my $1000.00 back and they said no I lost that money for mixing funds</p>
