<p>To protect his identity, the winner of the $1.35 billion Mega Millions jackpot filed a lawsuit against the mother of his child seeking injunction and $100,000 in damages</p>
<p>In most states across the US, lottery winners cannot remain anonymous. Even if the winnings are in the millions, most states require the winners to be identified, which can sometimes cause trouble for the lucky few. Maine is one of the states that requires winners to be identified. However, the winner of one of the largest Mega Millions jackpots in the state was able to collect their winnings through a limited liability company called LaKoma Island Investments earlier this year. This effectively enabled the person to remain anonymous and collect the grand prize.</p>
<p>Now, a new report released by the Portland Press Herald suggests that the lucky winner is willing to go to great lengths to protect his identity. Reportedly, the person who won the $1.35 billion Mega Millions jackpot filed a lawsuit against the mother of his child with the US District Court in Portland. With scarce details on the topic, the lawsuit identifies the man only by a pseudonym and confirms that he currently resides in Maine. Similarly, the mother of his child was also identified with a pseudonym, but it was confirmed that she lives in Dracut, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit alleges that the woman breached a non-disclosure agreement that was signed with the winner of the jackpot. This agreement reportedly dates to February this year and was signed between the duo before the man claimed the Mega Millions jackpot. The winner of the jackpot alleges in his lawsuit that the mother of his child shared “protected subject matter” with two persons she was not allowed to under the non-disclosure agreement. The defendant is given time until December 6, 2023, to submit a response.</p>
<p>The Lottery Winner Seeks Injunction, $100K in Damages</p>
<p>The lucky winner of the $1.35 billion jackpot beat incredible odds of 1 in more than 300 million to win the grand prize. As with other big sums, the winner can select a lump cash payment or annual installment payments for the full sum. The winner from Maine selected a lump cash sum payment, taking a staggering $723.6 million. It’s important to note that lottery winnings across the US are taxable so this sum is before the applicable taxes.</p>
<p>In his case against the mother of his child, the lottery winner seeks injunctive relief from a judge. Moreover, the winner is after some $100,000 in damages from the defendant.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the lawsuit reaffirms the lottery winner’s dedication to concealing his identity. The legal claim explains that the non-disclosure agreement signed between the winner and the defendant was to address “the unique safety, security, and privacy concerns associated with winning the lottery.” The legal document confirmed that the winner wanted to protect his identity so he could avoid irreparable harm to himself and his assets.</p>
