<p>Parimatch and Team Spirit will continue to work together through at least 2022 after the partnership between the two organizations began in 2019 and culminated with the Russian Dota 2 squad winning The International 10.</p>
<p>The event resulted in a massive $18 million payout going to Team Spirit and Parimatch will continue to be part of the team’s professional development in the years to come. The contract may be extended for additional two years through 2024 during which Parimatch will remain Team Spirit’s title sponsor.</p>
<p>Parimatch Helps Team Spirit’s Promotional Efforts</p>
<p>Parimatch’s logo and signage will be visible on Team Spirit’s jerseys’ front and sleeves for both the Dota 2 and CS:GO squads. The pair will work on a number of content activations similar to its previous collaboration between 2019 and 2021.</p>
<p>Parimatch and Team Spirit are also talking about the launch of a merch line that will be available to fans worldwide. Parimatch has proven to be a particularly lucrative platform with the betting agency collecting over four million bets over the last year on Team Spirit alone. Parimatch head of esports Stepan Shulga had this to say commenting on the deal:</p>
<p>“It is a genuine partnership. We started working even before the legendary roster appeared, even when Dota 2 as a whole was not a priority for “dragons.” The victory at the most prestigious esports tournament in the world opens a new page in the organization’s history for Team Spirit. Glad we are part of this story” Parimatch head of esports Stepan Shulga</p>
<p>Team Spirit Happy to Find a Strong Partner</p>
<p>The news was welcomed with equal enthusiasm by Team Spirit CEO Nikita Chukalin who praised the opportunity to be building on what has proved to be a successful partnership over the years. Chukalin commented:</p>
<p>“We are glad to announce the continuation of cooperation with the Parimatch brand. We carefully select companies and brands for potential collaboration. Parimatch has established itself as a reliable betting brand that focuses on esports and its development over so many years on the market.” Team Spirit CEO Nikita Chukalin</p>
<p>He also acknowledged Parimatch’s pull in the world of sports, citing some of the biggest partnerships the betting agency has been able to negotiate outside of esports. Chukalin thanked Parimatch for supporting and promoting Team Spirit both regionally and internationally.</p>
<p>Parimatch Determined to Boost Esports</p>
<p>Parimatch Tech Holding has vowed to promote esports globally and provide the necessary marketing and tech solutions to raise the vertical’s profile in the betting industry. Parimatch continues to support grassroots and professional esports players, hosting various events and backing esports as community-driven initiatives on social media and other advertisement channels.</p>
