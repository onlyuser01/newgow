    <h1>Sweeptastic Casino Hollywood Casino Wv Casinos By State Casino Game Online Casino Games Free WSOP s</h1>

<p>The World Series of Poker’s (WSOP) “Gladiators of Poker” No-limit Hold’em tournament has made history with its staggering participation, drawing the second-largest field ever seen in a live tournament. The event, which featured a $300 buy-in, saw an astonishing 23,102 players signing up when registration closed on June 10.</p>
<p>WSOP’s ‘Gladiators of Poker’ Stuns with Massive Turnout, Second Only to ‘Big 50’</p>
<p>Surpassing its predecessors, the “Gladiators of Poker” tournament now stands as the second-largest live event, trailing only behind the monumental “Big 50” No-limit Hold’em tournament of 2019, which boasted a staggering 28,371 participants. The sheer magnitude of the current turnout is a testament to the enduring appeal and growing popularity of the WSOP, reported The Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Sunday will mark the resumption of play for the surviving players from all four flights, as they gather at the prestigious Horseshoe Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas venues. The intense competition will culminate in a highly anticipated final table showdown scheduled for Monday.</p>
<p>Notable poker legend Daniel Negreanu emerged as one of the chip leaders during Day 1A, further solidifying his status as a force to be reckoned with in the poker world. As a six-time WSOP bracelet winner, Negreanu‘s presence adds excitement and anticipation to the already electric atmosphere of the tournament. In 2022, the poker legend won an impressive amount of $4,875,609 by participating in 107 events.</p>
<p>Additionally, another record was broken during the series, as the $1,500 buy-in Razz tournament witnessed the largest field in WSOP history, with an impressive 556 entries. WSOP continues to captivate and inspire poker enthusiasts worldwide with its unparalleled scale and competitive spirit.</p>
<p>WSOP Executive Director Determined to Replicate 2006 Success with Record Main Event Attendance</p>
<p>In May, WSOP geared up for what could be one of its largest player turnouts in history, according to WSOP executive director Ty Stewart. The goal was set to surpass the record from 2006 when 8,773 players participated, thanks in part to the legendary Chris Moneymaker. While replicating the 2006 feat is uncertain, Stewart remained confident and determined to make it happen.</p>
<p>Stewart guaranteed that the upcoming WSOP Main Event on July 3 will set a new milestone worth aspiring to despite aiming for a modest 1% growth this year. The 2006 event was a watershed moment for poker, as Moneymaker’s Cinderella story of qualifying through an $86 online tournament inspired a generation of players, resulting in the highest Main Event attendance in WSOP history. Moneymaker has become such a legend in the poker world that PBKC’s Poker Room hosted the inaugural stop of the Moneymaker Tour in May, featuring 20 tournaments with over $1 million in guaranteed prize money.</p>
