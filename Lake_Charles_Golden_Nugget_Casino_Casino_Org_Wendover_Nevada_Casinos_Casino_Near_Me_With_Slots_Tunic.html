    <h1>Lake Charles Golden Nugget Casino Casino Org Wendover Nevada Casinos Casino Near Me With Slots Tunic</h1>

<p>I signed up on January 15 2023. On Feb 2 I busted my account and made this last deposit or 0.011 BTC at which time I was logged out and sent a message that my account is at risk and I should contact support.</p>
<p>Coincidentally that was the exact time I reached VIP level 38</p>
<p>https://help.bc.game/en/article/perks-of-being-vip-38-on-bcgame-ykxqbl/ which provides extra perks, weekly-monthly and extra bonuses. So the disputed amount I entered is just an arbitrary number, it should probably be much higher combining my last deposit and the missed bonuses.</p>
<p>I chat with them and they instruct me to send an email to support@bc.game with the following information.</p>
<p>BCGame Username</p>
<p>Registered Email Address</p>
<p>One Deposit Transaction (TXID)</p>
<p>Commonly used IP Address</p>
<p>Commonly used device</p>
<p>I send it. Their reply is :</p>

<p>I completed the enhanced verification and there has been zero communication on their side since then. Even their live chat which used to work (talking to a human) is shut down. It's now a bot that basically ghosts you.</p>
<p>I feel robbed and violated. They stole my deposit, my earned bonuses and I sent them some very personal information which I now regret.</p>
<p>It feels to me like BC.game is undergoing an exit scam.</p>
