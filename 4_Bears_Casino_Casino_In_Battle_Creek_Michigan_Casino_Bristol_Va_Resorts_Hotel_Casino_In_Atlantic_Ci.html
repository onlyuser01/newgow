<p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation reported income from gaming operations totaled PHP18.27 billion ($353.5 million) for January through March. That’s a 15.6 percent gain on the same three-month period in 2018.</p>
<p>Federal law requires PAGCOR to share 50 percent of its gaming income with the government. After the five percent franchise tax and a PHP15 million ($289,177) donation to the Philippines Dangerous Drugs Board, President Rodrigo Duterte’s Bureau of the Treasury collected $170 million.</p>
<p>Net income after taxes came in at roughly $160 million, a 9.5 percent increase.</p>
<p>Along with issuing licenses and regulating commercial casinos – resorts primarily found in Manila – PAGCOR owns and operates its own casinos under the Casino Filipino brand.</p>
<p>Show Him the Money</p>
<p>Duterte has endured a contentious relationship with the gaming industry since taking office in June 2016. He initially viewed gambling as sinister as the illegal narcotics trade.</p>
<p>In 2016, the president directed law enforcement to crack down on underground gambling syndicates, and forced billionaire Roberto Ongpin to remove himself from PhilWeb – then the country’s largest e-gaming café operator – because Duterte considered him an “oligarch” who “must be destroyed.”</p>
<p>Duterte later eased his position on internet gambling, saying “pay the correct taxes, gamble until you die. I do not really care.”</p>
<p>The president also directed PAGCOR to sell off its casinos and transition into a regulator-only capacity. He later changed that view after learning the eight Casino Filipino venues and nearly three dozen satellite facilities were simply too profitable to dissolve.</p>
<p>Philippines casinos won $3.6 billion last year, and the four integrated land-based casino resorts in Manila generated the lion’s share of the gross gaming revenue (GGR). City of Dreams, Solaire, Resorts World, and Okada won $2.71 billion. E-gaming parlors reported GGR of more than $500 million.</p>
<p>Licenses Halted</p>
<p>The president later directed PAGCOR to make the Philippines “the top gaming and entertainment destination” in Southeast Asia by 2020.</p>
<p>The federal agency began adhering to that task by issuing gaming licenses to various operators for multibillion-dollar resorts in Manila’s Entertainment City and other tourism-focused locales. And then yet again, Duterte changed his position on gaming.</p>
<p>PAGCOR had issued permits for Landing International to construct a $1.5 billion integrated resort, but last August Duterte ordered construction to be stopped just hours after the company held a ceremonial groundbreaking. The president said the developer obtained a land-lease deal that was “unconscionable” and “disadvantageous to the government.”</p>
<p>Duterte additionally ordered Galaxy Entertainment stop its plans to build a $500 million casino resort on the vacation island of Boracay. He then issued a verbal decree that bans gaming from ever coming to the island.</p>
<p>The president subsequently issued a moratorium on PAGCOR granting new gaming licenses. Waterfront Philippines Inc, a company that has been trying to obtain licensure since 2015 for a casino in Manila, said this week it expects its legal case to reach the Supreme Court.</p>
