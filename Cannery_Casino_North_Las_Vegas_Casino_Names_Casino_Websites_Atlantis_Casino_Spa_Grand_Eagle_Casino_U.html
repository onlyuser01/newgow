    <h1>Cannery Casino North Las Vegas Casino Names Casino Websites Atlantis Casino Spa Grand Eagle Casino U</h1>

<p>Regulatory compliance software specialist US Integrity has unveiled a new agreement with Conference USA, an American intercollegiate conference. As agreed, the former party will provide its reliable solutions to the league.</p>
<p>An expert in compliance, US Integrity analyzes data sets to crack down on fraud in sports betting. Thanks to its robust solutions, the company is able to monitor events and identify suspicious patterns. The data is then presented via a fully customized, easy-to-use dashboard that companies and leagues can use to access information in real-time.</p>
<p>In addition to that, US Integrity will also supply Conference USA with a variety of educational materials for student-athletes, coaches, league staff and officials. The league will gain access to the Prohibet system, which is US Integrity’s fully encrypted decentralized cross-monitoring and notification platform. Conference USA, for example, will use Prohibet to make sure that its athletes, coaches and officials do not engage in sports betting.</p>
<p>Prohibet allows leagues to maintain their integrity by ensuring adherence to local regulations. The product is developed in collaboration between US Integrity and Odds On Compliance, a major tech consultancy serving the sports betting and gambling sectors.</p>
<p>As a partner of US Integrity, Conference USA joins an extensive league portfolio, which includes the Southeastern Conference, the Big 12, the Pac-12, the West Coast Conference, The Big West, the Big Sky, MLB, the NBA, UFC and the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>US Integrity Is Excited to Support Conference USA as It Grows</p>
<p>Conference USA’s commissioner Judy MacLeod expressed her thoughts on the partnership with US Integrity, emphasizing its importance to her team. She admitted that navigating the betting ecosystem can be a daunting task, which is why the compliance specialist’s help would be welcome.</p>
<p>With all of the uncertainty in the gambling space in college athletics, USI provides peace of mind that we are doing our part to manage any illegal activity that may compromise the games being played while providing an essential role in educating and protecting our campus administrators, coaches, student-athletes and officials. Judy MacLeod, commissioner, Conference USA</p>
<p>Matthew Holt, US Integrity’s co-founder and chief executive, also commented on the new alliance, saying that his team is “thrilled to be working with Conference USA.” He said that his company would gladly support the league as it continues to experience rapid growth.</p>
<p>Holt concluded: “The core values of our partnership will provide their student-athletes with educational training services and ProhiBet’s state-of-the-art encrypted data transfer system.”</p>
<p>US Integrity just teamed up with RealResponse to deliver a revolutionary service exclusively designed for intercollegiate athletics.</p>
