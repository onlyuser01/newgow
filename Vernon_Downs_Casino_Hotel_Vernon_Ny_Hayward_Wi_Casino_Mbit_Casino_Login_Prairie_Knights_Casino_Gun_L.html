For 10 years, he was a part of the Oregon Department of Justice‘s organized crime division and he was also a member of the Cyber Crime Task Force with the FBI, providing strategic advice and guidance for different investigations. Wells’ professional background includes police officer roles with different law enforcement agencies such as the Oregon State Police, among others.</p>
