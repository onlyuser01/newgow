    <h1>Harrah S Philadelphia Casino Emerald Queen Casino Hotel Rivers Casino Jobs Muckleshoot Casino Desert</h1>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru .</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we were waiting for the regulator's final decision, which is clear, and you were informed of what you committed. Therefore, we accept the casino's decision.</p>
<p>If a private exchanger (3rd party service) should have been a reason that your payment method matched with the payment method used in other accounts, as you claimed, it would be rather an "aggravating circumstance". Despite it basically does not make sense in connection with your other claims regarding your deposits and withdrawals, the casino has to verify all the payment methods used in your account. In case you used any 3rd party service for such purposes or made it impossible for a casino to verify yourself as the owner of the deposited funds or used payment methods (or it matched with payment method in another account), unfortunately, you also should have counted on the option that your verification will not be possible, and you risked all the deposited funds.</p>
<p>As for your claims that your account has been blocked after it "went to +", this is not correct at all. Your account was closed because you breached the casino's Terms and Conditions , which you accepted upon registration. However, the casino detected it after requesting a withdrawal - it is not obliged to perform additional checks earlier. It is an industry standard that players have to use only payment methods belonging to them, in their own names, and their own funds for deposits - it automatically means that it is forbidden to use the same payment method(s) in more than one account, logically. Accepting crypto e-wallets may indicate that players could avoid the verification of their payment methods or their funds' origin, but there are also other conditions that have to be met. I recommend you read the casino's rules in detail, available on the link above, especially parts 5, 7, and 8. Partially, also the section "Anti-Money Laundering" is devoted to the topic.</p>
<p>It really does not matter if your referral link was used by anyone, or if it was done from another device or IP address, and it does not matter if you were the only one who used your email address in the casino - in most online casinos, it is enforced by their systems, and it is not possible to register with the same email address more than once. In addition, you mentioned the 2nd level verification - also irrelevant since there are usually more levels of verification.</p>
<p>There are also several inconsistencies in your version of the story, and there is also completely irrelevant and useless information for the case - shared by you above.</p>
<p>After gathering and reviewing all the necessary information and having an internal discussion with the team, we decided to close this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - there are reasonable grounds to believe that we are talking about multiple account use or collusion, as well as the impossibility to pass the KYC, which is a must to be able to withdraw any funds from your casino account.</p>
