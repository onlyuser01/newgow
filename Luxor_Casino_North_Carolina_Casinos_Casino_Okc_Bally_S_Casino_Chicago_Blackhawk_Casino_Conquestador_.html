    <h1>Luxor Casino North Carolina Casinos Casino Okc Bally S Casino Chicago Blackhawk Casino Conquestador</h1>

<p>Please.</p>
<p>I am in trouble because my withdrawal is refused.</p>
<p>Even if you send the various specified documents more than 20 times, you will be asked for another request.</p>
<p>The current issue is the submission of proof of funding.</p>
<p>Regarding this document, we received an explanation in this exchange that "a screenshot showing the balance of the bank account is fine". So I have submitted screenshots of the three bank accounts.</p>
<p>After that, I was asked for a separate document that could prove my income.</p>
<p>I have submitted a screenshot of the public pension (2022.06) being transferred to my bank account, which is clearly marked as "welfare pension" in my name, account number and even the transfer item.</p>
<p>Up to this point, even if we issue it, we will continue to make other requests as follows.</p>
<p>// + Misunderstanding I'm very sorry.</p>
<p>Sorry to trouble you, but please submit the following documents as a source of funding:</p>
<p>・ Salary statement</p>
<p>・ Documents certifying the source of income</p>
<p>・ Statement of card or bank account usage</p>
<p>・ Taxation certificate or income certificate (can be issued at the municipal office or convenience store) + //</p>
<p>・ Salary statement: No retirement age 3 years ago.</p>
<p>-Documents certifying the source of income: Screenshots of the balances of the three bank accounts have been submitted. The deposit amount is over 10 million.</p>
<p>-Card or bank account statement: Screenshots of the account have been submitted many times.</p>
<p>・ Taxation certificate or income certificate: No certificate will be issued because the pension payment will start from this year. (Japan only issues the certificate of the previous year)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I am in great trouble.</p>
<p>Hope will never be used again, so I want to withdraw the full balance.</p>
<p>After that, the account disappeared.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
