<p>OceanBet is strengthening its global reach with a new partner to help bolster the sportsbook and casino operator’s affiliate reach</p>
<p>The company has teamed up with Intelitics to strengthen its affiliate program and paid-media channels. This comes at a time when OceanBet is looking to significantly strengthen its player acquisition push.</p>
<p>Intelitics Strengthens Affiliate Marketing Efforts at OceanBet</p>
<p>OceanBet is also looking to grow and advance its presence in several markets, among which Latin America and Canada. This includes Brazil, which is one of the hottest opportunities in the region and is already valued at more than a billion US dollars.</p>
<p>Intelitics will provide OceanBet with granular data and AI-driven insights to help champion better player acquisition. A lot of the red tape will be cut through the introduction of automated reporting and personalized dashboards to strengthen OceanBet’s grasp of its operations and affiliate traction.</p>
<p>OceanBet will also leverage Intelitics solutions and share them with partner affiliates, which will allow them to further calibrate the way they advertise the brand to help it bring more players on board with the brand. Meanwhile, OceanBet is powered by Delasports, a platform provider that already offers strong and tailored solutions for each market where the company operates.</p>
<p>Intelitics VP of sales and growth Allan Petrilli was excited to see this new partnership form and to also have the opportunity to work on bolstering OceanBet’s affiliate program. Petrilli spoke highly of the available tools that Intelitics has to ensure that the operator is able to monitor its affiliate programs and gauge their efficacy. He concluded:</p>
<p>This will allow OceanBet to be aggressive with their spend, knowing that it is being deployed in the right areas and with the best partners. This in turn allows them to drive new player sign-ups at pace and at scale in each of the markets they target. Intelitics VP of sales and growth Allan Petrilli</p>
<p>The Obvious Choice of a Partner</p>
<p>OceanBet Al Turner was similarly pleased with this new business opportunity and what it meant for his company. He called Intelitics “the obvious choice” and said that the company brings a platform, tools, and capabilities that are definitely welcome at OceanBet.</p>
<p>He further praised Intelitics’ ability to provide in-depth and worthwhile data. “We are excited to be using Intelitics to deploy our hugely ambitious plans for our affiliate program and the OceanBet brand,” Turner concluded.</p>
<p>Intelitics has been signing a number of partnerships over the past months. The company has offered to strengthen the affiliate efforts of prominent brands such as Mohegan Digital in Canada and Aspers Group.</p>
