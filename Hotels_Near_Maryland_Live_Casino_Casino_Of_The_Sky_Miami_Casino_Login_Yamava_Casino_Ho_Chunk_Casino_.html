    <h1>Hotels Near Maryland Live Casino Casino Of The Sky Miami Casino Login Yamava Casino Ho Chunk Casino</h1>

<p>The international casino-entertainment company that has access to 18 OSB licenses and owns 15 casinos has chosen the experienced chief financial officer and strategic advisor for her “deep finance, operations, and strategy expertise”, as stated by Bally’s chairman of the board Soo Kim.</p>
<p>On Board in Numerous Sectors</p>
<p>With an accumulated experience of over two decades and counting, Bally’s new member has proven her worth and shown her skills on many boards in a number of different sectors, with top corporations, government organizations, and non-profit companies on her resume. Harris has shown her leadership and financial executive potential in fields like private equity, venture capital, real estate, insurance, health and wellness, retail, and financial services.</p>
<p>Until recently, Harris has taken the position of inaugural global vice president of diversity and inclusion for International Game Technology. The latter is a multinational gambling company that creates slot machines and additional technology used in the gambling field with headquarters in London and major offices in Rhode Island, Las Vegas, Rome, and Providence.</p>
<p>Before that, Harris was also MIB Group Holdings’ executive vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer. MIB Group is a long-standing and highly trusted company that delivers one-of-a-kind data solutions that advance the life insurance industry.</p>
<p>Harris Is Delighted to Join Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>In her new position, Harris and her team will be responsible for looking into the receipt of regulatory approvals. Commenting upon the news, Harris expressed her honor to be joining “such an outstanding group of individuals” as part of Bally’s board. She also said that she was looking forward to using her own expertise and perspective to support the ongoing growth and expansion of the company.</p>
<p>At the moment, Harris is a board member in publicly traded 1847 Holdings LLC, a company that offers consulting and advice and acquires small to medium size businesses in different industries. What’s more, she is a member of CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield’s board and is a trustee of the District of Columbia Retirement Board.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Bally’s managed to obtain a positive vote from Chicago’s City Council on an amendment to Planned Development No. 1426. The respective amendment helped the company get one step closer to seeing its dream to build a new flagship casino in the city turn into reality. The $1.7 billion project would see a casino spreading over one million square feet, together with a 500-room hotel, a rooftop bar, an event space, and an open space.</p>
