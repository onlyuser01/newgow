<p>This marks the first time Evoplay's games are available for the streaming platform. Thanks to the collaboration, online players can tune into streams online and even engage in betting behind the action. Online players have the ability to benefit from a shared player experience by selecting the size of their bet and the number of spins, creating a group bet.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular and fan-favorite games from Evoplay are now available for Livespins' lobby. Such include unique titles like October Pub, Indiana's Quest and Fruit Super Nova, among others.</p>
