<p>Related Companies, a real estate giant, has announced that it will be pursuing a casino license in a joint venture with Wynn Resorts. The casino license that both parties want to gain will be for a casino on the western half of the Hudson Yards.</p>
<p>Developing the Western Point of the Yards Is a Priority for the Governor as Well</p>
<p>The western point of the Hudson Yards complex is currently a sunken train yard and Related is not the only one who’s looking to transform the region. Governor Kathy Hochul, Andrew Cuomo’s successor, is also focused on transforming the exposed yard.</p>
<p>If the massive casino complex is greenlit, it will be situated in the vicinity of the Jacob Javits Convention Center. The state’s gambling commission has until October to form a board that will be in charge of managing the licensing process. Licensing is set to commence 90 days after the commission is formed.</p>
<p>Hudson Yards is the biggest mixed-use private real estate development in the history of the US and the interest from Related Companies in this region is not something new.</p>
<p>In fact, company officials have been trying to come up with a plan for the western end of the Hudson Yard for years.</p>
<p>According to the original agreement, Related was supposed to build six residential buildings, a school and parks by 2025. The residential buildings were supposed to feature 265 units, all of which had rates below market standards.</p>
<p>Related Is the First Suitor to Form a Partnership With a Casino Operator</p>
<p>Several competitors of Related tried to pursue partnerships with Sands and Hard Rock, but Related is the first one to strike a deal with a major operator. According to the NY Post, the other developers that are interested in building casinos are Thor Equities, Vornado Realty Trust and SL Green.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the state of New York authorized 3 casino licenses in the downstate region. Mayor Eric Adams requested two of them to be in New York City.</p>
<p>Jeff Blau, the CEO of Related, stated that the Western Yards is the perfect spot for a resort that will “reinvigorate” the tourist economy and bring billions of dollars in tax for both the state and the city.</p>
<p>Even though Manhattan is considered by many as one of the last untouched gambling markets, all bidders will have a lot of difficulties to overcome.iGaming is also a subject that is often talked about. A recent report done by VIXIO Gambling Compliance and commissioned by Light &amp; Wonder revealed that New York can rake in more than $400 million in annual tax from online gambling.</p>
