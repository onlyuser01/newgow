<p>Delasport, a UK-based sports betting and iGaming B2B software solutions provider, announced that it is expanding its product portfolio with bingo offerings. The company will provide END 2 END’s live bingo solutions, giving UK partners access to an advanced interface available on all devices.</p>
<p>Delasport Invested Heavily in Its UK Ventures</p>
<p>The B2B provider recently redoubled its focus on UK expansion. In July, Delasport earned its B2B Remote Gambling Software License and Remote Betting Host Real Events License, allowing the company to operate freely within the country. It can now offer UK operators its entire portfolio of interactive wagering services.</p>
<p>According to Delasport CEO Oren Cohen Shwartz, the UK was Europe’s most desired iGaming market and an integral part of the company’s expansion plans. He added that Delasport’s tailored and personalized experiences would allow operators to generate better financial results, increase player retention and provide an unparalleled betting experience.</p>
<p>The Partnership Will Benefit Both Companies</p>
<p>Delasport’s partnership with END 2 END shows a steady commitment to the company’s partners. The B2B provider aims to become an all-in-one solution encompassing online casino, sports betting, and player account management services.</p>
<p>Shwartz hoped that adopting END 2 END’s bingo offerings would be fruitful for both parties.</p>
<p>We are delighted with the new global partnership with END 2 END, a complete omnichannel bingo solution that complements Delasport’s innovative sportsbook, casino, and PAM. Oren Cohen Shwartz, CEO of Delasport</p>
<p>Alejandro Revich, END 2 END CEO and founder, also exclaimed his satisfaction with the partnership. He noted that being able to provide their product to a high-profile and market-leading provider like Delasport would boost the brand’s image. Revich then affirmed his company’s commitment to cooperate with Delasport in all markets.</p>
<p>This deal adds momentum to END 2 END’s expansion strategy, which is ensuring our proprietary content and technology is embraced worldwide. Alejandro Revich, CEO and founder of END 2 END</p>
<p>The UK Is Part of a Larger Expansion Strategy</p>
<p>The UK is not the only market where Delasport recently expanded. The B2B provider received certification from Gaming Laboratories International, allowing it to offer its products in the Netherlands. The dutch market is highly competitive and has the potential to become one of the most lucrative in Europe despite tight regulations.</p>
<p>With its aggressive expansion strategy, Delasport has cemented itself as one of the fastest-growing iGaming suppliers in Europe. The company is licensed to operate in Malta, Romania, Sweden, the United States, and Denmark. A deal with operator Winpot also marked further expansion into North America. Marketing-wise, the brand secured a sponsorship deal with snooker legend Ronnie O’Sullivan, who will become Delasport’s latest brand ambassador and represent the company in various online and offline campaigns.</p>
