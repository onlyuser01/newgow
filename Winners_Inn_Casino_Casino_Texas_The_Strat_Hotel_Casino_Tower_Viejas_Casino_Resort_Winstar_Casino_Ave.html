<p>Scout Gaming Group, a full-range provider of fantasy sports, has inked a deal with Apple iSports, an Australian operator of free-to-play fantasy games and sports betting. The former company will provide its new partner with sportsbook and fantasy sports solutions.</p>
<p>Scout to Power Apple iSports with Solutions</p>
<p>In accordance with the agreement, Scout Gaming will power Apple iSports with its cutting-edge sports betting and fantasy sports solutions. The deal is set to kick in during the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Apple iSports is a company that primarily operates in Australia. However, the firm also holds a license to operate in North Dakota’s sports betting market. The new agreement with Scout Gaming Group will reinforce Apple iSports’ offerings and will help it engage more people with exciting fantasy games.</p>
<p>Apple iSports is fully mobile-friendly, allowing players to access its content no matter where they are. The company is firmly expanding its presence within the sports betting sector by offering attractive pricing/betting types on high-profile events.</p>
<p>The Australian operator says that its mission is to “make life more exciting” by creating engaging real-money sports betting and fantasy sports experiences. Apple iSports aims to create a thriving environment for fans of sports, esports, racing and fantasy sports.</p>
<p>A Great Opportunity for the Provider</p>
<p>Niklas Jönsson, Scout Gaming’s current chief executive officer, commented on the new agreement with Apple iSports. He called this a great opportunity to tap into a new betting market that Scout has yet to explore. Because of this, Jönsson is certain that the agreement with Apple iGaming will be “very valuable” for the company’s first steps in Australia.</p>
<p>To get the opportunity to deliver our whole product offering to a partner on a market which have not delivered to before feel very positive. And to make a first delivery of a sportsbook according to the partner’s requests will be very valuable in customer discussion going forward. Niklas Jönsson, CEO, Scout Gaming Group</p>
<p>Scout Gaming Group is a publically-traded licensed and regulated business-to-business provider of fantasy sports and betting solutions. The company has a significant presence in the European market where it offers the only liquidity network for fantasy sports. The company holds licenses to operate in Malta and the United Kingdom and is steadily growing its reach.</p>
<p>Two months ago, Scout Gaming posted its interim report for the first half of the year. Unfortunately, the company’s gaming revenue dropped amid an intensive period for its business.</p>
