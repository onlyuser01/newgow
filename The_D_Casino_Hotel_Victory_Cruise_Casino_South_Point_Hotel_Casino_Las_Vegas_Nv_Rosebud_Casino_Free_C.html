<p>The renowned provider of games for the online gambling industry, Pragmatic Play, announced the launch of a new spooky Halloween-themed slot game. The company confirmed earlier this week the launch of Infective Wild, its newest slot game offering wilds, free spins and a chance for significant prizes.</p>
<p>The latest slot game comes ahead of Halloween, and it features a spooky theme with vibrant colors and thrilling sound and visual effects. The new slot game from Pragmatic Play uses standard card symbols between 10 and Ace but also incorporates high-paying symbols such as a cat, raven and potion, among other symbols that match the distinct Halloween theme.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play's recent slot game offers 40 paylines and an RTP of 96.09%. Quality animations and engaging options such as auto-play elevate the excitement further, making Infective Wild a perfect addition to the iGaming provider's growing portfolio of thrilling and unique games.</p>
<p>In a statement released Thursday, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, Irina Cornides, shared her excitement about the latest slot game. "We set out to create a game that embodies the spooky spirit of Halloween while also offering an unexpected mechanic – Infective Wild with its infectious feature spreading Wilds across the reels does just that and more," she explained.</p>
<p>Cornides added that the base game offers big win potential which is further propelled by Wild wins. "We’re excited to see the reception this Halloween-themed slot has from players and operators alike," she explained in conclusion.</p>
<p>While the base game offers an entertaining experience, players can benefit from Wilds that have the ability to substitute any base game symbols. This unique feature grants a chance for mouth-watering payouts. However, Wilds that land adjacent to standard high-paying symbols help transform them into additional Wilds. This process continues to spread, effectively infecting the reels for staggering payouts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, landing at least three scatters grants the players free spins. Just before the start of the free spins round, the slot game presents eight mini-reels that can award up to three free spins during the bonus round. Wilds that land during free spins stay in their place, granting a chance for the transformation of symbols and more subsequent wins.</p>
<p>The recently released slot comes after Pragmatic Play announced a partnership with Rank Group earlier this month. Representing a content extension, the collaboration saw the iGaming provider agree to deliver its Live Casino portfolio, powering the gambling operator's offering.</p>
