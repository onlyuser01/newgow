<p>New COVID-19 Restrictions to Come in Effect on November 30</p>
<p>Due to recent spikes in positive COVID-19 cases in Rhode Island, Governor Gina M. Raimondo announced new COVID-19 restrictions on Thursday this week. The new restrictions are planned for a two-week period and will be effective from November 30. The new restrictions are going to affect multiple businesses including bars, gyms, indoor sports facilities and other entertainment venues which will close for the two week period. Under the restrictions, the two Bally’s Rhode Island casinos will also close for visitors.</p>
<p>Starting today, we’re lowering the social gathering limit to a single household. This means you should not be spending time socially with anyone you don’t live with — this includes on Thanksgiving. — Gina Raimondo (@GovRaimondo) November 19, 2020</p>
<p>While those restrictions will be in effect 10 days from now, Governor Raimondo revealed that social gatherings are limited to one household and this restriction was applied immediately. Furthermore, the maximum capacity of churches, temples and other places of worship is reduced to 25% with a maximum 125 people attending.</p>
<p>Currently, indoor dining venues close at 10 P.M on weekdays and 10:30 P.M. on Fridays and Saturdays. Those restrictions will remain unchanged, with the only exception that the capacity limit will be reduced to 33% and guests sitting at the same table must be from one household. However, the capacity restrictions do not affect the outdoor dining venues.</p>
<p>Beginning next Monday, Nov. 30, we’re entering a 2-week pause. This is the key to our winter strategy. During this time, we’ll be able to prevent overwhelming our hospital system without the need for a total lockdown. Here’s what the pause will look like: pic.twitter.com/EcXz9UBZSN — Gina Raimondo (@GovRaimondo) November 19, 2020</p>
<p>Residents Must Follow the Health and Safety Guidelines</p>
<p>Commenting on the subject, Governor Raimondo outlined that she hoped that no additional restrictions would be needed. However the recent increase in positive COVID-19 cases prompted enhanced restrictions. In an interview for Providence Business News, the Governor said that she had done everything she could “to avoid the severe restrictions”.</p>
<p>“I’m in a world of all bad choices. And I am trying to pick the least bad options.” Rhode Island Governor Gina M. Raimondo</p>
<p>Furthermore, Governor Raimondo added that Government officials wanted to make sure that the people have enough time to prepare. She also stressed that the positive result depends on whether the people follow the health and safety guidelines.</p>
<p>Responding to the announcement about the new restrictions, the president of Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel and executive vice president of Bally’s Corp., Marc Crisafulli said in a statement that the operator respects the Governor’s decision to close the two properties. Acknowledging that the pandemic is still ongoing, he added that the health and safety of the Rhode Island residents must remain a top priority.</p>
