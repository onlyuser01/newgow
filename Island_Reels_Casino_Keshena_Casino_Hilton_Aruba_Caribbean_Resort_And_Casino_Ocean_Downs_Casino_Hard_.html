<p>Pariplay Games Are Now Available in Colombia</p>
<p>The leading aggregator and service provider Aspire Global’s Pariplay Ltd has launched games in Colombia with leading operator Codere.</p>
<p>Pariplay Continues to Grow in Latin America</p>
<p>As part of a deal that will help it cement its place in the rising Spanish-speaking industry, the Malta-based supplier has made its debut on the Codere games tab.</p>
<p>The deal fits in with Aspire Global’s overall Latin American expansion plan. BtoBet, a sister company of Pariplay and an Aspire Global subsidiary, has signed high-profile deals in Colombia to provide its sports and player account management (PAM) platform Neuron 3 to Betfair and William Hill.</p>
<p>Chief commercial officer at Pariplay, Christine Lewis, said: “We see LatAm as a market with great growth potential and our teaming up with Codere Colombia is very significant in increasing the audience for our games in the region.”</p>
<p>Lewis continued by saying that Pariplay is optimistic that the success of their portfolio of games will continue to improve when they go live with such a strong presence in the industry.</p>
<p>Casino product manager at Codere, Sarit Adania, made a comment saying that Pariplay’s slots will help Codere broaden its slot portfolio in Colombia, and the company knows how famous these games are there.</p>
<p>This is a partnership that Codere claims would benefit all parties in an area where online gaming is rapidly expanding.</p>
<p>This Year’s Pariplay Is off to a Great Start</p>
<p>The deal is the latest in a series of agreements signed by Pariplay in Colombia’s controlled market, and it gives Codere access to Pariplay’s vast portfolio of over 120 creative and entertaining slots.</p>
<p>In April, Greentube, a major retailer and manufacturer of gaming solutions for the Internet and mobile devices, signed a multi-jurisdictional distribution deal with Pariplay.</p>
<p>Greentube, the NOVOMATIC Interactive subsidiary, made its content available on Pariplay’s Fusion site under the terms of the arrangement.</p>
<p>Pariplay signed another studio to its Fusion site in March with Gamshy joining the ranks of devoted iGaming service providers. Pariplay now provides an even more valuable portfolio of games to potential partners while still attracting new ones thanks to Gamshy’s diverse selection of games.</p>
<p>Under license from Colombia’s national regulator, Coljuegos, Codere operates online under the Codere Apuestas name.</p>
<p>On its FusionTM platform, which is also fitted with a variety of conversion, retention, and tool mechanics, Pariplay aggregates thousands of others from some of the industry’s most well-known studios, in addition to its own titles.</p>
<p>More than 16 controlled markets now have licenses for the site.</p>
