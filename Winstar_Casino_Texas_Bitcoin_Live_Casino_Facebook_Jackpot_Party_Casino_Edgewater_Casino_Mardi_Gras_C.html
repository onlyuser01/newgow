    <h1>Winstar Casino Texas Bitcoin Live Casino Facebook Jackpot Party Casino Edgewater Casino Mardi Gras C</h1>

<p>I deposited $20 with the "200% no rules first deposit bonus" and was credited $60. They claim there were no rules but all they have are rules. I played through the 1x requirements and ended up with around $60. They said I could not withdraw the bonus funds. I've never had that happen before and it is a little scammy but fine.</p>
<p>I figured since I rolled over the requirement, I can take the money and play elsewhere. I played blackjack and decided to make a withdrawal of $120. They denied it and told me that I had broken the rules... but I had already gone through the requirements! The support rep said it was fine too! They removed my winnings from my account and have ghosted me. I have sent followup emails to them and they have not responded.</p>
