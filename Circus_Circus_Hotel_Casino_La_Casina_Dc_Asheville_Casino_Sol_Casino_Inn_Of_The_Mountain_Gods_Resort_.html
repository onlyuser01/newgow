<p>New Jersey Just $13M Shy of Hitting $500M in Sports Betting Revenue for October 2019</p>
<p>New Jersey just $13M shy of hitting $500M in sports betting revenue for October. New Jersey collected a total of $487,924,504. Online betting leads the way.</p>
<p>New Jersey Close to Hitting $500M per Month in Revenues</p>
<p>An extra $13 million and New Jersey would have hit the $500M mark in revenues for a single month in sports betting. According to PlayNJ.com analysts, this figure is still within reach for NJ considering that the basketball season is already ongoing.</p>
<p>New Jersey collected a record $487,924,504 in October and this was a 10% rise from the previous month. In September, the state collected another record of $445.56M in handle.</p>
<p>With the start of the NBA and college basketball, it’s only a matter of time until NJ smashes the existing record for the highest revenue collected in a month. Nevada holds this record for $600M in a month, a record they set earlier in the year.</p>
<p>According to PlayNJ.com lead analyst, Dustin Gouker, “New Jersey has a real shot at surpassing Nevada again, if not in October, some time before the end of the NFL season. The state’s handle is growing at a pace near 100%, year-over-year. And the overlapping of football and basketball should propel New Jersey into new territory.”</p>
<p>A Complete Breakdown of October’s Revenues</p>
<p>Data from the NJDGE revealed more figures for October. Sports betting revenue rose from $38M in September to rake in a whopping $46.4M. This translates to a 9.5% hold for October. Compared to the same month last year, NJ raked in a paltry $11.7M – showing a 297% increase.</p>
<p>To blow your mind further, the current YTD revenue stands at $237.1M up from $51.96M in October last year. In total, sports betting contributed $26.82M in taxes for October from the previous $26.56M recorded in September.</p>
<p>On the other hand, online sports betting continues to show a gradual increase. Various online platforms including tablets, mobile, desktops among others contributed 85.5% of all betting in the state, a clear indication that New Jersey residents prefer online gaming.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a 1% rise from the previous month with every $1 spent on physical locations, $6 is spent online. The percentage translates to $416,964,519 in monthly handle.</p>
<p>Leaders in the Industry</p>
<p>PointsBet (Meadowlands) and FanDuel Sportsbook continue to blaze the trail in terms of revenue. In total, both establishments raked in $24.8M in October, representing over half the state’s revenue for October. Further, this showed a year-on-year increase from $96M in September to $120.54M in October.</p>
<p>Close on their heels are FoxBet (Resorts Digital) and DraftKings Sportsbook with a combined $10.56M in revenue. Other notable mentions include Hard Rock, who raked in $1.96M, Monmouth/William Hill/Sugarhouse/TheScore at $1.7M, Ocean Casino/William Hill at 1.6M, and BetMGM/Borgata at $1.4M.</p>
