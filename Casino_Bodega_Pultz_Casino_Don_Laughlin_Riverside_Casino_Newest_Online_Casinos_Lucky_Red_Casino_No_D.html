<p>Booming Games has become the latest authorized iGaming supplier to get the go-ahead from the national regulator in Denmark and be licensed to roll out its products on the market. The supplier has hailed the recent acquisition of a license that will allow it to deploy its games in one of Europe’s most lucrative and important regulated markets.</p>
<p>Booming Games has welcomed this opportunity as a considerable milestone in its company history, as Denmark is known for its high level of channelization, robust standards towards customer protection, and overall convergence of the world and region’s best operators and suppliers.</p>
<p>The move further strengthens the studio’s own footprint in Europe and allows it to continue to grow locally. Among the games that will be available to players in Denmark are such player-favorite picks as Buffalo Hold and Win, The Wild Wings of Phoenix, Gold Gold Gold, and not least – TNT Bonanza.</p>
<p>Booming Games is also set to bring dozens of other titles that complement and establish its portfolio as a leading and preferred choice for many players. Commenting on this opportunity, Booming Games CCO Frederik Niehusen has hailed the significance of the move and said that the company was excited.</p>
<p>"This accomplishment empowers us to leverage our current capabilities and enhance our product lineup to cater to the changing demands of our customers," Niehusen added. Bingoal has been fast-expanding in some of Europe’s most important and biggest markets, including the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the company has been able to sign a partnership with Bingoal, another prominent local brand that has an established track record locally and is a trusted and reliable partner to suppliers and players. Among the games introduced to the operator at the time were King Cobra, Cash Ping, and more.</p>
<p>Booming Games has been very keen to scale its presence well beyond the European market as well. The supplier signed a partnership with Rivalo in May this year to set foot in Colombia for the very first time and break ground with local audiences.</p>
<p>Not least, Booming Games was successful in another market closer to home, Spain, where the company launched its product portfolio with TonyBet in June. Overall, Booming Games has been maintaining a very good pace of growth which has been further strengthened with its move into Denmark now.</p>
