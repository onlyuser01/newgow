<p>The victim was an alleged car and credit card thief who was reportedly trying to escape the police</p>
<p>The Osage Casino &amp; Hotel in Bartlesville, Oklahoma has become the site of a deadly shooting after an alleged car thief was shot trying to escape. In his escape attempt, the thief began dragging a tribal police officer who was holding onto the vehicle, prompting a deadly shot from a bystander.</p>
<p>According to reports, at 5 am on Tuesday, a tribal police officer had tried to get the suspect out of the vehicle. Instead of turning in, the alleged thief tried to escape by driving away and dragging the officer along in the process.</p>
<p>At that point, another person shot the driver, wounding him mortally. Luckily, the police officer did not sustain injuries, according to reports.</p>
<p>Early reports denied that the shooter was a tribal officer. In fact, local news outlets claim that neither the alleged thief nor the suspect are tribal members.</p>
<p>The Police Did Not Reveal the Identity of the Deceased Person</p>
<p>Later reports claim that the victim of the shooting was a vehicle thief who was also guilty of stealing credit cards. His identity is yet to be disclosed by the local police.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) is currently investigating the matter, although the authority did not confirm whether the shooting suspect is in custody and whether they would be charged for their actions.</p>
<p>The Osage Nation Police Department and representatives of the Osage Casino &amp; Hotel are also assisting with the investigation.</p>
<p>The Osage Casino &amp; Hotel Bartlesville is a brand-new casino that opened its doors a few days ago. Offering 521 slot machines and multiple gaming tables, as well as a 102-room hotel, a restaurant and event facilities, the venue offers exciting experiences to its visitors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the recent car theft and shooting are not the only incidents to happen at the casino. Local news outlets previously reported that a person had been stabbed at the casino complex during the weekend. However, the condition of the victim was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Speaking of casino-related crime, Ð° recent casino bar fight in Nevada led to the arrest and imprisonment of a man who caused jaw injuries to a female victim.</p>
