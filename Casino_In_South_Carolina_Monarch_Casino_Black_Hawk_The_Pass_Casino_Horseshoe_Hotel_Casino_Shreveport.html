    <h1>Casino In South Carolina Monarch Casino Black Hawk The Pass Casino Horseshoe Hotel Casino Shreveport</h1>

<p>I made a deposit of R$ 400.00 for a 150% bonus, I entered the bonus money and had to fulfill the rollover requirements, which I managed to complete and requested the withdrawal. Yesterday I received a negative reply to my withdrawal request, stating that I violated the bonus rules.</p>
<p>During the call, the representative said that I had made a bet above the maximum allowed value, which would be R$ 9.00. I am 100% certain that I didn't even approach this limit, as my highest bet was R$ 2.50. After questioning, he backtracked and said that I had violated the multi-screen rules, stating that I should not have been playing on multiple screens at the same time (which I actually did). I was playing on two screens on my computer and another on my phone, however even with three screens total, I did not exceed the maximum bet limit of R$ 9.</p>
<p>I was using three screens because the rollover is quite large, and it would have taken a considerable amount of time to meet the goal.</p>
<p>I was playing in the same environment with the same IP, but using multiple devices.</p>
<p>It doesn't make any sense to invalidate my withdrawal. People who play bonus hunts/rollovers sometimes use four screens or more at the same time.</p>
<p>I have several questions:</p>
<p>1- If I was committing an infraction, why was I allowed to play to completion and only block my withdrawal after completing the rollover? If I had been informed earlier, I would have increased my bet and finished sooner. It feels as though they were just toying with me.</p>
<p>2- Why was I initially told that I was denied withdrawal due to a bet above R$ 9.00 and not for the multi-screen issue? And if multi-screening was indeed an issue, why was I allowed to play in the first place? None of this makes sense.</p>
<p>3- This is the second time my withdrawal has been blocked. The first time, I mistakenly made a bet of R$ 12.00 (just one out of more than 18,000 spins in various slots) on a slot called Chaos Crew, which ended up being a winning bet (144,00). They refunded my deposit of R$ 200.00 but withheld my winnings of R$ 1,380.00. Yet again, they let me fulfill the entire rollover only to block my withdrawal.</p>
<p>4- I understand the casino's rules, but in these two cases, there seems to be a lack of leniency. Looking at the entire history of my betting, I have done everything that they requested. I am not asking for millions, which for the casino would be nothing. This has led to my dissatisfaction as a customer.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your thoughts on this matter and any assistance you might provide. If you need more information, I am more than happy to provide it.</p>
<p>P.S. My deposit amount is available for withdrawal, but the total amount that I won has already disappeared from my account.</p>
