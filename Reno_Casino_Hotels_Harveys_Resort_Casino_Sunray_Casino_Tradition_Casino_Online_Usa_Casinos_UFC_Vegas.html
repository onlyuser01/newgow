<p>The fight between Paulo Costa vs Marvin Vettori will be featured in the UFC Vegas 41 event and will take place on Saturday, October 23, at 4 pm EST and broadcast on ESPN+.</p>
<p>Fight Overview: Vettori vs Costa</p>
<p>These two fighters are perfectly matched to guarantee a great fight early on Saturday evening. Costa has taken on some serious opponents so far, including Israel Adesanya who understandably TKO’d Costa in the title fight between the two.</p>
<p>Yet, Costa has been able to take out Yoel Romero (by decision) and then strike two TKO’s against Uriah Hall and Johny Hendricks respectively. The Eraser has had a good overall showing in MMA and he is looking at 13-2-0 as his overall score, which has earned him the peculiar moniker.</p>
<p>While Adesanya has proven too much to handle, Costa has been able to deliver time and again in other bouts. Then you have Vettori. Vettori did lose a fight against Israel Adesanya by a decision that understandably gives him an edge here.</p>
<p>After all, Vettori has been able to go the distance against Adesanya whereas Costa was taken out. Vettori’s fighting style makes him a dangerous opponent when looking for opponents who cannot last in the octagon. He fought and defeated Jack Hermansson and Kevin Holland by decision both, and he submitted Karl Roberson.</p>
<p>The Italian Dream is 17-4-1 and looking good but there are no guarantees that he will be able to take out Costa. However, his stamina is his true strength and that is precisely what we are looking at today. While Vettori has the upper hand in terms of endurance, he has also suffered a few more defeats.</p>
<p>Tale of the Tape: Costa vs Vettori</p>
<p>Costa Vs. Vettori 30 Age 28 6’1″ Height 6’0″ 72″ Reach 74″ 13-2-0 Record 17-4-1</p>
<p>Costa and Vettori are very evenly matched in terms of physical attributes and that is evident. The two fighters are bound to have a very close fight that will thread the needle and have fans on their toes. We predict that Vettori will be the most likely winner hereby decision.</p>
<p>What Other Fights Are Worth Betting On?</p>
<p>For the rest of the UFC Vegas 41, you have plenty of options. Nick Negumereanu should definitely overtake Villanueva in the endurance game and outlast him by decision. Dwight Grant is also likely to win by a decision as Francisco Trinaldo doesn’t immediately strike as a fighter who can take you out via TKO. In fact, we think a (+110) bet on Grant here adds a bit of value to your betting against Trinaldo’s (-130).</p>
