    <h1>Harrah S Casino Nc Extreme Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Little River Casino 123 Vegas Casino 300 No</h1>

<p>On the 19th of November, 2023, I made a deposit of €20 with a 200% bonus. I fully read and complied with the terms and conditions of the bonus. I was able to implement the bonus through a win and had a real-money balance of €1,100 in my account. I requested a withdrawal of €800 and used the remaining money for betting. For the first five days, nothing happened with regard to the withdrawal. After contacting the support twice asking why the withdrawal was still pending and whether any documents were needed for verification, I was asked to provide the appropriate documents for verification. This included proof of identity via an ID document and a selfie, which was accepted. I also provided proof of address through an official document that was likewise accepted. Furthermore, I provided evidence of the means of payment using a photo of my credit card, which was also accepted. Now we arrive at the issue at hand. I was asked to provide a transaction list of my credit card. I uploaded this document twice, and it was declined both times. The reason given was that only outgoing payments could be seen on the transaction list and no incoming payments were visible. I wrote to the support several times and explained that this is a prepaid credit card linked directly to my bank account. Therefore, the payments made with this credit card are directly debited from my bank account. I also suggested that I can submit a document confirming the connection between the credit card and my bank account, and a bank transaction list showing that the payments made from the credit card were directly debited. I got no response other my request would be reviewed, so I should please be patient. During the first call today morning (24.11.23), I was assured the relevant information would be forwarded to the authorization department dealing with verification documents, who would then get back to me. This has not been done. The submitted list was again rejected with the exact same justification that no incoming payments were visible. They requested I should upload another list that shows incoming payments (which don't exist as the amount is debited directly from my bank account). As a result, I twice tried to contact the support again to explain my problem, accompanied by supports still images. However, I was merely removed from the chat and logged out of my account, despite my polite approach and meticulous problem description. To be honest, I'm not sure what to do other than write to the support. However, if they just want to "fob me off" by kicking me out of the chat, I find it utterly user-unfriendly. I sincerely hope that the Casinoguru team can help me, as many others have had very good experiences receiving support from Casinoguru as one can read on their forum. All aspects touched upon here – from the deposit, bonus turnover, withdrawal request, verification progress, and contact with the support – are naturally verifiable through screenshots.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
