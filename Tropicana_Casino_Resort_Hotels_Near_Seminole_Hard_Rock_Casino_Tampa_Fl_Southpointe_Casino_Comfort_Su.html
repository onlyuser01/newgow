    <h1>Tropicana Casino Resort Hotels Near Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Fl Southpointe Casino Comfort Su</h1>

<p>Not too long ago, Passport Technology descended on Washington State when it entered an agreement with the Angel of the Winds Casino Resort. That was last September, and now the multi-service payment solutions provider is expanding its presence in the state. It has secured a new partnership with the Lucky Eagle Casino &amp; Hotel.</p>
<p>Passport Adds New Ground in Washington</p>
<p>This deal will give the Washington casino access to Passport’s casino payment technology, marketing, cage automation, and other solutions. It was designed to increase employee efficiency, decrease variance, and improve guest experiences.</p>
<p>Passport’s advanced payment and cage automation systems will ensure that our guests have easy access to cash throughout the property.” Angel Of The Winds CFO Tyrone Huff</p>
<p>Passport is a casino payment industry provider. It offers transaction processing, digital payments, loyalty programs, and rewards. The company added in a press release that this new installation will offer several cutting-edge payment options that improve the guest experience by allowing faster, more reliable and more accurate transactions at both the cage and at the kiosk.</p>
<p>Lucky Eagle’s guests can experience Passport’s multi-functional CashStream kiosks on the gaming floor. CashStream provides users with multiple cash access options and responsible gaming checks. It combines Passport’s customizable software with advanced hardware and security to give them fast and easy access to cash.</p>
<p>Passport’s LiveCage platform will make it easier for Lucky Eagle guests to move through the cage lines, according to the press release. LiveCage’s intuitive operating system “automates cash dispensing at the cage and minimizes cash variances.”</p>
<p>Passport’s Jackpot Pro simplifies the payout process in the event a jackpot hits on a slot machine. Both LiveCage and Jackpot Pro use web-based management tools and reporting tools that allow managers and cashiers to audit and configure the system more easily and efficiently.</p>
<p>Passport has continued to gain access to more of the US gaming market over the past couple of years. Prior to its latest announcement, it extended its ongoing relationship with Golden Nugget last month. The company’s technology solutions are found at all Golden Nugget properties across the country.</p>
<p>That followed several new agreements for the company last year. It is partnered with Resorts World Las Vegas, Victoryland Casino and the Delaware Racing Association, among others.</p>
<p>Jason King, CRO of Passport, added about the new partnership with Lucky Eagle, “We are delighted the Chehalis Tribe chose Passport to assist with streamlining operations and delivering world-class service to Lucky Eagle’s guests. Passport strives to provide innovative customer-facing payment and back-office solutions that impact both casino guests and team members alike, and we look forward to this new partnership.”</p>
