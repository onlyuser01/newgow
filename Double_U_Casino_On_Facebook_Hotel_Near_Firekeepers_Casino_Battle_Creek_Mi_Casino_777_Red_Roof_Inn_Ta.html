    <h1>Double U Casino On Facebook Hotel Near Firekeepers Casino Battle Creek Mi Casino 777 Red Roof Inn Ta</h1>

<p>Sapphire Las Vegas, the world’s largest gentlemen’s club, wants to bring more entertainment to its visitors. The venue plans to capitalize on the growing popularity of gambling and add poker machines to its offer. However, doing so is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Sapphire Has to Acquire a License</p>
<p>To proceed with its plans, Sapphire Las Vegas will first have to secure a country approval and a state gaming license. However, doing so might not be as easy as Sapphire had hoped. Las Vegas Review-Journal, a local news outlet, reported that the Clark County Commissioners are somewhat reluctant to supply the club with a license.</p>
<p>The reason for the commissioners’ reluctance is that an old regulation requires slots venues and adult entertainment businesses to be at least 250 feet apart. However, this rule is already 43 years old, which is why the commissioners may decide to grant an exception.</p>
<p>For the time being, Sapphire Las Vegas will have to wait for the Clark County Commissioners to make up their mind. The latter announced that they want to wait until October or later before announcing their decision. In that time, the commissioners will review whether Sapphire Las Vegas deserves to be granted an exception. This will mainly depend on the commissioners’ review of Sapphire’s business and whether they are able to conclude a gaming license would not harm the club’s employees or customers.</p>
<p>The Club Wants to Mitigate the Post-COVID Damages</p>
<p>Sapphire’s decision to diversify its offerings stems from its sub-performing business. The venue has been negatively impacted by COVID-19, leading to a sharp decline in visitors. As a result, the company lost around a quarter of its customer base.</p>
<p>In addition, the club remained closed for a long time during 2020 and was one of the last venues to reopen. In June, the club applied for a restricted gaming license, asking Nevada’s regulator to allow it to run up to 15 gambling machines.</p>
<p>Nevada’s Resort Association, however, is worried that if the commissioners grant Sapphire an exception, this can become a precedent for other strip clubs asking for the same treatment. On the other hand, Sapphire Las Vegas will not be the first Las Vegas strip club to be granted a restricted license as two other venues, namely Club Platinum and Play It Again Sam, already offer gambling.</p>
<p>The commissioners will decide whether Sapphire is suitable to hold a license and will announce their decision in October or later.</p>
