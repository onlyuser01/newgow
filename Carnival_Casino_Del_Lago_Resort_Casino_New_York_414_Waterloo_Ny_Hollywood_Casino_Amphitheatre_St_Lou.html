<p>Internet Vikings reinforced its presence in Pennsylvania thanks to another deal with a local iGaming supplier</p>
<p>Internet Vikings, a global iGaming hosting provider, has inked a Pennsylvania-facing agreement with the US-based games provider ODDSworks. As announced on LinkedIn, Internet Vikings is ready to support any company seeking to capitalize on the opportunities in the iGaming and sports betting markets.</p>
<p>Internet Vikings and ODDSworks Ink a New Agreement</p>
<p>The current agreement expands Internet Vikings’ presence in Pennsylvania, providing the company with yet another client in the state. ODDSworks is a fairly young iGaming provider, having been founded in 2020, but is also a company that fields an experienced and knowledgeable team.</p>
<p>Collectively, ODDSworks’ members have more than 100 years of experience in retail and online gambling, helping the company roll out content of superior quality. The company also boasts a robust Remote Gaming Server, which helps it provide games to many regulated gambling jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In just two years since its creation, ODDSworks has expanded its presence drastically. The current agreement will allow the company to further expand its footprint in the country thanks to Internet Vikings’ reliable turnkey solutions.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Internet Vikings will provide ODDSworks with its specialized cloud hosting services.</p>
<p>Internet Vikings Is Happy to Support ODDSworks’ Growth Journey</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the two companies addressed the new partnerships, sharing more about their delight to be working with one another. Rickard Vikström, Internet Vikings’ founder and chief executive officer, said that he is happy that ODDSworks continues to trust his company. He noted that it is “extremely rewarding” to be able to be a part of the provider’s growth story.</p>
<p>Kristoffer Ottosson, the company’s chief operating officer added that Pennsylvania is a very special state when it comes to online gambling and sports betting. Furthermore, Internet Vikings already has agreements with many companies in the Keystone State and has the expertise needed to help ODDSworks grow.</p>
<p>Lastly, Steven DeMar, ODDSworks’ executive vice president, voiced his thoughts. DeMar emphasized his delight in the opportunity to work with Internet Vikings and hopes to mint agreements with the hosting provider in other states as well.</p>
<p>It is of great value to us that Internet Vikings offers a reliable total turnkey solution for each new market we enter. Steven DeMar, EVP, ODDSworks</p>
<p>Internet Vikings is one of the most distinguished companies when it comes to iGaming hosting. The company was founded in 2008 and works with some of the best iGaming companies in the world. Last month, the provider expanded its deal with GAN to cover a whopping 15 extra states. A few months earlier, the company penned a West Virginia-oriented hosting deal with EveryMatrix.</p>
