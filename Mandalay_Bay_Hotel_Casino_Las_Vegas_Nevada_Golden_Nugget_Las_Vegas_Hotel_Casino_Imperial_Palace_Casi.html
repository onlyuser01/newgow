    <h1>Mandalay Bay Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nevada Golden Nugget Las Vegas Hotel Casino Imperial Palace Casi</h1>

<p>Hi sorry I'm late but I was away for work.</p>
<p>Here is the link for the video https://wetransfer.com/downloads/cc374409772938729af12709b26b593520200917212704/348ea54d12f96dd54cf690f256c8d0a820200917212808/3617a4</p>
<p>I entered with a budget of 30 euros to show that everyone can win with this software, in 40 minutes playing very low compared to what I play I made 70 euros in profit.</p>
<p>Look at the video, at the beginning we have a very low count so I play bet 1 waiting for the deck to "load" later, when the count is high; I start betting from 10-20 euros and that's it.</p>
<p>Another piece of advice, on the net there is a table with instructions on whether or not to call a card according to our score and the dealer's card; forget that stuff.</p>
<p>Most people still haven't figured out that the goal in blackjack is not to get 21 but to bust the dealer. You can also win with a two in hand if the dealer busts but you don't necessarily win with a 21 you could tie.</p>
<p>If you notice how I play I don't always call cards even if I have 14-15-16, with this software, in addition to counting, you must also look at the amount of cards remaining in the deck so as to understand whether to call or not.</p>
<p>If you buy the software then let me know how much you have won ðŸ™‚</p>
