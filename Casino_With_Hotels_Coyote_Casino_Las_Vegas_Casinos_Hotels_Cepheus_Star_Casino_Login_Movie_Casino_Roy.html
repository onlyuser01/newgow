    <h1>Casino With Hotels Coyote Casino Las Vegas Casinos Hotels Cepheus Star Casino Login Movie Casino Roy</h1>

<p>Good afternoon, dear administration!</p>
<p>Faced a problem at playdom casino (pokerdom mirror site).</p>
<p>The point is, I am a compulsive gambler and have been fighting my demons for a long time. The last time I found a solution for myself, which is as follows: daily monitoring of resources in order to look for the opening of new casinos and their immediate blocking after registration. The last such decision allowed me to give up playing for a year ... until yesterday. Once again, I looked at the resource for the purpose of monitoring and discovered the placement of a new playdom casino. After a quick look at the profile, I realized that this is NOT a new casino from playdom, but its mirror.</p>
<p>PREVIOUSLY, I ALREADY WAS LOCKED IN POKERDOM CASINO FOR A PERIOD ALWAYS FOR GAME DEPENDENCE.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order not to risk it, I registered with playdom to block my account. Actually, I turned to the chat with this question. The operator told me that since you are blocked on pokerdom forever, then here you will be blocked as well forever. I thanked and ended the conversation. After some time, I knocked on the chat again and found out why the account was still active, to which I was told that the request had already been sent to the technical department. The fact that I tried to play it safe played a cruel joke on me.</p>
<p>After some time, I receive a letter in the mail from a representative of playdom that I had an account that was blocked forever, but they allow using this account for the game as an exception. (Screen 1). Moreover, they offer me to take advantage of all available bonuses. And this is 150% under wager 25. This whole situation brought me back to the beginning of the path in the fight against my disease. I ask for help to understand the situation.</p>
<p>Investigate and punish casinos for violations of casino rules, licenses, and responsible gambling rules. The casino was driven by the desire to cash in on me and my problem, and it was the reason that all my efforts were in vain. The casino unreasonably accepted deposits from me, which is also the subject of a dispute over the cancellation of the transaction.</p>
<p>I have filed a complaint with the casino and the licensee. The casino did not give any answer, but only silently blocked the account. To the answer of the licensee, who also sent them a letter-question: why did they allow the player to create a second account, they also did not answer. (Screen 2)</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
