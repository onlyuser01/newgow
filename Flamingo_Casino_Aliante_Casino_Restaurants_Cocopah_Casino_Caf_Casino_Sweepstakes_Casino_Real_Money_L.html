    <h1>Flamingo Casino Aliante Casino Restaurants Cocopah Casino Caf Casino Sweepstakes Casino Real Money L</h1>

<p>It’s been almost six months since the Super Bowl, meaning that you have every right to feel hungry for some NFL action. Luckily for you, the wait is over as the 2022 NFL preseason starts on Thursday, August 4. As always, the preseason kicks off with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game.</p>
<p>Held during the weekend of the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, the exhibition game takes place at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio. This year is going to be 60 years since the inaugural game was played.</p>
<p>The two teams that will lock horns in the 2022 Hall of Fame Game are the Las Vegas Raiders and the Jacksonville Jaguars. Neither team has won it in the past, with the Raiders losing one game and tying one. Meanwhile, the Jaguars have played only one Hall of Fame Game thus far, losing to the Carolina Panthers in 1995.</p>

<p>Betting Odds Favor the Las Vegas Raiders</p>
<p>The Raiders were pretty decent in the 2021 NFL season, finishing second in the AFC West and fifth in the conference. They had a 10-7 record in the regular season and lost to the eventual AFC winners Cincinnati Bengals in the first round of the Playoffs.</p>
<p>This is a great success, considering that all sorts of problems hit them early on in the season. As a reminder, their former coach Jon Gruden resigned in October after The New York Times leaked emails in which he used racist, homophobic, and misogynistic language. Then, only a few days later, wide receiver Henry Ruggs caused a car crash that claimed a life of a 23-year-old girl, for which his contract with the Raiders was terminated.</p>
<p>Despite all the problems, the Raiders still managed to do reasonably well. And in 2022, their ambitions are even higher! Truth be told, they have every reason to feel optimistic as their management did a great job in the off-season, signing arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL in 2022 – Davante Adams.</p>
<p>The former favorite passing target of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Johnson is still adjusting to the new environment. However, it’s almost certain he and his new QB Derek Carr are going to work great together.</p>
<p>We could see the new partnership in action in the 2022 Hall of Fame Game, although probably not too much. The thing is that coach Josh McDaniels will probably want to keep his key men away far from any possible risk.</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars Preparing for a Better Season</p>
<p>The Jaguars have made it to the postseason only seven times since the establishment of the franchise back in 1995. The last time they made the playoffs was in 2017, but since then, they’ve been pretty disappointing, finishing at the bottom of the divisional table each time.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Jags finished the season with a 1-15 record. A year later, carried by their rookie quarterback Trevor Lawrence, they got to three wins. This season, they want to do even better. With Doug Pederson – the man who led the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl LII win – they have a good chance to achieve their plans.</p>
<p>This goes especially if they prepare themselves well during the pre-season. That said, you can be certain they’re going to take things seriously in the 2022 Hall of Fame Game. Even though they don’t have as good players as the Raiders, we think they’re going to do well.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Raiders vs Jacksonville Jaguars Prediction</p>
<p>Roster-wise, the Raiders are way superior to the Jags. However, it’s very likely that the Raiders coach will want to keep his heavy weapons safe and not risk any injuries. Instead, we could see McDaniels give some youngsters a chance in the Hall of Fame Game.</p>
<p>When it comes to Pederson, he might go with a different approach. The coach is probably looking to take this opportunity to get the most of his team’s preparation for the big games coming their way in September. As a result, he might decide to put all of his crucial players in action. If he does that, his team will almost certainly win. And if he doesn’t, the Jags still probably won’t embarrass themselves.</p>
<p>Pick: Jacksonville Jaguars +2</p>
