<p>Hi Thomas</p>
<p>Thank you for replying so promptly .</p>
<p>You know it's a heartbreaking feeling for your winning to be confiscated especially from just a humble capital .</p>
<p>I do understand that they have placed wagering rules . Or the online casinos around the world have this as a benchmark .</p>
<p>Although a few casinos I have played at online doesn't let the bet to go through it comes at an error . Then the spin resets . That is when you buy the bonus free spins which I believe I have done . There fore that's when I knew I have surpassed the wagering requirements .</p>
<p>However , it's not with HELLSPIN CASINO . They have laid this as a trap. So when you purchase the bonus buy . It will just go through.</p>
<p>When we (players ) play the online pokies . We tend to try to anticipate what the next spins is coming to us . We change our bets up and down we buy bonus spins . Just to sway the good fortune that we hopefully smile on us. We the wagering requirements of X 35 to 40 . The numbers are in the thousand . It an Insurmountable task . And to come out winning. Then letting the withdrawal to be processed. Only to be confiscated at the end . 12 hours later ..</p>
<p>I.have 2 kids . I told them Christmas. Wi be special this year .</p>
<p>I had 2 sleepless night .</p>
<p>I believe HELLSPIN is a dishonest operator . To allow the bet to go through . Where other casino I played LEVEL UP WINSPIRIT WILDTORNADO BIZZO. have never let that bet go through . Its the best interest of the player . The next day I told my circle if friends that I won at hellspin. Check them out .. it's a positive publicity. Now so much anger and hatred . And when I spoke to the customer support they keep saying that I agreed to the terms and condition . Like to rub it in further .</p>
<p>They said that they have noticed that I have breach betting rules . What does that mean someone was watching every game I played ? Of course not . Algorithm and parameters are in placed to flag the players that have breached the rules . They could easily used those parameters to help the little people who are just trying they luck .</p>
<p>As I have read in the Complaints Against HELLSPIN there was a Canadian player who won $15000 but suffered the same fate .</p>
<p>It has happened before why didn't they set the parameters to help both side out . Which is being done by other Casino. To avoid this torturous mediation.</p>
<p>I'm saying hellspin could have been a better Casino if they have taken the initiative .</p>
<p>I have requested for the play history to be sent to me .</p>
<p>I hope I have made a reasonable plea to have my winnings returned to me</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Maritess ****</p>
