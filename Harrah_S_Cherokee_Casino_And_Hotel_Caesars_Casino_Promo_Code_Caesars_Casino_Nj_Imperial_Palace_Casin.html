    <h1>Harrah S Cherokee Casino And Hotel Caesars Casino Promo Code Caesars Casino Nj Imperial Palace Casin</h1>

<p>Hello my name is Art</p>
<p>I have joined this chat because I'm having issues with the game crash at bitstars casino. I've been playing it for about a year now and it has been multiple occasions where I would jump out of the ship before it crashes and I never get the win,. The glitch always happens when I bet high. On ebi was betting 450 ubtcs and the game went over one hundred. I jumped out at around 85 but the game would not let me jump out, even after hitting the cash out button several times it wouldn't let me and just crashed, so frustrated. I immediately want to customer service and let them know what had happened they said that they were going to check it out on their end and the lady came back on and said we've checked it out and everything was played through properly so sorry for your loss kind of thing and didnt escalate the issues Which is nothing but b<strong><em>*</em></strong>. So it happened again and again and again and I complained again and again and again only this last time I asked her to look at the game on her end and when she came back immediately told me that she was going to escalate this issue and created a ticket for me and that somebody would get back to me. The next day I got an email from them saying that they had reviewed the game and everything was played through properly and there was no cash out button hit before or after the ship crashed. So I replied to the email and mentioned the fact that the lady that I spoke to originally checked out the game and she noticed that there was a problem with the game that's why she created the ticket correct. Now you're telling me that you have reviewed the the game and everything was played properly. I asked for a copy of the game so that I can review it and we could be on the same page. The email that I got back was saying that they followed the guidelines and the rules and that their decision was final. I sent them another email saying I would like a copy of the game so that we can understand and come to a mutual agreement. They escalated the ticket to another team was got back to me and said the exact same thing so I asked him for a copy of the game. He would not give me a copy of the game and after asking several times he told me that there was no copy of the game after all so there's nothing to give to me. So now two people have lied about reviewing this game and coming to the unfair conclusion. That's asking the lady in the original complaint what she saw they would not let me isn't that funny. I'm trying to find out who the CEO or makers of the game are so that I can write them an email because bitstarz is unreasonable and won't hear me out. The last game I played I was betting $23 dollars and had jumped out at about 13 times. Thus losing $299 dollars. It's funny because the game will glitch constantly and pause even, when it's going to go high making me nervous and wanting to jump early. I usually stand My ground and play the game all the way through even if I lose. It seems to me like the game has gotten to know me and whenever I bet high it completely changes its behavior so when I bet low when I'm losing losing and I'm down to like let's say 10 cents or whatever the game constantly glitches I'm just upset and frustrated. Losing thousands of dollars I have finally had enough and this time I won't back down having to do whatever it takes to get to the right person with the intelligence of doing the right thing. So if anybody knows or has any information as to who to contact please let me know it would be a great help and I'll keep taking and digging and not at these f<strong>*</strong>* take my money. I would advise anybody everybody not to play this game or this casino for it is a scam I believe. Best wishes and to all good luck.</p>
