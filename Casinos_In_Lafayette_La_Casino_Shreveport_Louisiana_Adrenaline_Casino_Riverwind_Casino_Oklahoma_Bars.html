<p>Parkin joins Allwyn to help the operator add to its extraordinary story and fulfill its phenomenal potential</p>
<p>Global lottery group Allwyn continued with its preparations to assume management of the UK National Lottery by expanding its senior team with the appointment of Kerry Parkin as Global Communications Director.</p>
<p>Becoming Part of Allwyn’s Extraordinary Story</p>
<p>Parkin announced her new role via LinkedIn, excited to join Allwyn and its team during times of global expansion and growth, hailing the group’s “phenomenal potential.”</p>
<p>“I am delighted to announce that I join Allwyn today as their new Global Communications Director,” Parkin stated in her profile on the network, eager to become part of “the extraordinary Allwyn story” and help the group fulfill its huge potential as a global lottery operator.</p>
<p>“With a presence in six countries, and the bid winner for the fourth license for the National Lottery in the UK, it’s such an exciting time to join,” Parkin continued in her comments, anticipating “a phenomenal year ahead for Allwyn” and feeling impatient “to get started.”</p>
<p>Parkin is moving to Allwyn after two years of service as Global Communications Director for Australian-based Buy Now, Pay Later company Zip Co, where she was spearheading the development and execution of the company’s communications and public affairs strategy, working with teams across Australia and the UK.</p>
<p>Her professional career also features roles as Communications and CSR Director for UK’s favorite coffee shop chain, Costa Coffee, and as Managing Director of global consultancy and advisory firm Teneo for its UK office, managing communications with Facebook’s EMEA division and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Allwyn Expanded on Both Sides of the Atlantic</p>
<p>Last month, Allwyn reached an agreement with Ontario Teacher’s Plan for the acquisition of Camelot Lottery Solutions group of companies for an undisclosed fee and thus enter the lottery market in the US via the Chicago-based group and its agreements with two state lotteries, the Illinois Lottery and the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery.</p>
<p>Camelot LS Group has long-term agreements to operate the Illinois Lottery as a private manager and with the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery to enhance the lottery’s operations and the acquisition presented Allwyn with an opportunity to execute the next step of its global expansion strategy.</p>
<p>The sale agreement for Camelot LS Group followed shortly after Allwyn and the Ontario Teacher’s Plan agreed on the acquisition of Camelot UK, the parent behind Camelot LS Group.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Camelot UK was announced after it became clear that Allwyn would be the next UK National Lottery operator following the decision by Camelot UK to withdraw from pursuing legal action against the Gambling Commission and finally allow the national regulator to award the fourth UK National Lottery license the winner.</p>
