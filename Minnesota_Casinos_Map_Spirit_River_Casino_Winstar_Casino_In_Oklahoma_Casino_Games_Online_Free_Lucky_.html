<p>Parions Sport’s online and retail brands have teamed up with Paris Saint-Germain through 2025, becoming the official and premium partner of the sports team. Thanks to this new partnership, Parions Sport will gain visibility with PSG fans in the next three soccer campaigns with circumference signage available at Parc de Princes, the team's home stadium.</p>
<p>Additional brand assets will be distributed through PSG’s websites and the club’s officialapps. ParionsSport en Ligne, which is the online brand, will focus on promoting the partnership and bringing exclusive content on social media.</p>
<p>The platform will further offer exclusive fixtures and odds on all of the club’s betting matches and games. Meanwhile, ParionsSport Point de Vente, which is the retail offer of the brand, will make sure to promote the partnership across its 28,000 points of sales.</p>
<p>Parions Sport will remain committed to ensuring that any betting products advertised with PSG will be in line with the country’s responsible gambling standards and code of conduct. Parions Sport has established itself as a leading purveyor of betting markets across France with the company now maintaining a number of healthy partnerships with the NBA, Olympique de Marseille, and others.</p>
<p>The company is owned by Française des Jeux, the National Lottery. The FDJ recently announced its intent to buy Aleda, a popular payment option. The transaction should allow the operator to assist merchants in physical points of sales. The partnership has naturally led to an outpouring of support from executives on both ends of the bargain.</p>
<p>FDJ CEO of Sports Betting Richard Courtois said that the partnership with PSG would enable Parions Sport to considerably extend its presence in the betting landscape and strike home with new fans. He assured that FDJ remains a leader in the sports betting space in France. Courtois assured that the partnership should yield distinct benefits to PSG fans and sports bettors in general.</p>
<p>PSG Chief Partnership Officer Marc Armstrong said that he was happy with the tie-up and that FDJ and Parions Sport is no doubt a force to reckon with in the sports betting space in France. FDJ has been working hard to ensure that sport in France retains its integrity.</p>
<p>Apart from teaming up with Sportradar to counteract fraud and manipulation, the company also launched the #SmashTheHaters social media campaign. The campaign is aimed at educating fans and protecting athletes who are harassed by angry fans who lost money on a wager hinging on an athlete performing in a certain way.</p>
