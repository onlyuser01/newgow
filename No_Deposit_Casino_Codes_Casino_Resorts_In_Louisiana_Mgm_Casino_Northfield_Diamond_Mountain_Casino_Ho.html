<p>Sushi Wins Slot Review</p>
<p>Sushi Wins slot by Woohoo Games is a medium volatility slot with a decent 96% RTP and a rather traditional five-by-three grid. The game’s bet levels range from $0.20 to $200, offering budget and high-rolling players the chance to plunge into the delicious world of sushi rolls, raw fish, and pungent wasabi.</p>
<p>Apart from an outstanding theme and graphics, Woohoo Games has come up with clever ways to make the gameplay so much more worth it, featuring Free Spins and Multipliers, a Bonus Game and Expanding Wild that only adds to the fun. Let’s take a closer look at what Sushi Wins Slot is in our review.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Take a Pew and Have a Roll</p>
<p>Sushi Wins slot game is designed exactly in the way you would expect it to be. A neat traditional Japanese table is arranged with various sushi rolls that have different facial expressions, along with raw fish rows, free spins symbols shaped as a mall cup of water, and your usual suspect avocado rolls.</p>
<p>Soy sauce and other condiments frame the grid, which blends into the backdrop, but still has its distinctive quality to keep your attention on the action. The background consists of green plush cushions, chopsticks and a sunlit yard that is just out of frame, but hints at the thematic richness of the game all the same.</p>
<p>You will find it very easy to onboard and play as all the buttons and additional options are readily visible from the side menu with no excessive design elements to get in the way. As to the actual design of the symbols, as we have mentioned, you will have your rice rolls neatly tightened in nori bundles with a small, animated face on each piece beckoning back at you. This is a game that will whet your appetite for winning – and perhaps sushi!</p>
<p>Sushi Wins Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Sushi Wins sports an excellent design that is underpinned by solid game mechanics, which will keep on giving long after you have seen the last of them. Now, for the game’s symbols and payouts, five small sushi rolls are the low-paying symbols.</p>
<p>You can see your salmon-filled ones, tuna, crab rolls and avocado sushi rolls which will always reward the same amount and fetch you 100-150 units for 5 matching symbols on any of the 20 paylines.</p>
<p>The higher symbols are styled as traditional Japanese sushi slices, which feature rice and a heavy slab of salmon or other sea delicacy on top. They are easy to spot and use. The betting limits will range from 0.20 to $200, which is pretty standard for Woohoo Games slots and will accommodate budget and high-roller players.</p>
<p>These hefty slabs tend to pay a bit more with the salmon one the winner and awarding you 500 for 5 matching symbols, as opposed to the avocado one which is still a high-paying symbol, but will fetch you 200 for 5 copies. You can preview the paylines if you are interested in the game’s info box as well, but all in all, the paylines will always light up on the reels when you hit a successful combination.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animations and audio used in Sushi Wins slot are distinct and yet discreet. Woohoo Games has earned itself a reputation for always building games that are visually rich and entertaining while also making sure that they are still very neatly arranged and executed. Everything, from the static grid to the rapidly spinning reels, to lighting up winning combinations is designed with the utmost care and consideration. Sushi Wins is truly one of the best visualized slots we have seen in a long time.</p>
<p>Sushi Wins Gameplay</p>
<p>Sushi Wins makes it very easy to navigate the entire grid and play easily and without any friction. The actual betting slip is tucked away to the side, but it’s still discretely present and easy to find and reach when you need it. The grid is clearly visible and takes the focal point of the action with players able to make small adjustments by using the menu at the right-hand side.</p>
<p>The menu also features Autoplay where you can actually pre-load an infinite amount of spins, but we strongly recommend using the 10, 25, 50 or 100 pre-configured options instead. The bet denominations are also very handy, ranging from $0.20 to $200 with a lot of extra options in between. All in all, Sushi Wins is a great way to enjoy yourself if you are looking for a neat and accessible slot!</p>
<p>Sushi Wins Features: Expanding Wilds, Bonus Games, and More Sushi!</p>
<p>Before you go chop-sticking your sushi rolls, it will help to know what some of the main game features in Sushi Wins are. Here is a brief overview of what to expect in the slot.</p>
<p>Expanding Wild: When the Wild Symbol hits the 3rd reel, it will expand and cover the entire reel, triggering free spins for the neighboring reels as well. The wild will naturally substitute for any missing symbol that you need to form a winning combination, adding to the potential to get a nice payday!</p>
<p>Bonus Game: The bonus game will be another chase of the reels where you can multiply your current bet size by collecting multipliers. The bonus has the potential to award you a massive win based on your core bet.</p>
<p>Free Spins: What a slot would be without free spins? Players will want to get the Free Spins symbol on reels 1, 3, or 5, to trigger up to 10 free spins with a 2x multiplier in the level. Multipliers are part of the bonus game as well, and Sushi Wins slot makes sure to deliver great experiences.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Love It or Hate It, Sushi Wins Is Irresistible</p>
<p>No matter where you stand on sushi as a rule, you will find Sushi Wins to be simply delectable. The game is crafted with a lot of care and focus on building an experience that appeals to players. The flexibility of the betting limits paired with the multipliers and game features make for a truly outstanding slot. Even if you aren’t one much for sushi, you will still want a bite out of Sushi Wins!</p>
