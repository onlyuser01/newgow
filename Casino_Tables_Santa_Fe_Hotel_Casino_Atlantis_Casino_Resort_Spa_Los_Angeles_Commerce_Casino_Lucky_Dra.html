<p>Online fundraisers are underway for several victims and their relatives following last week’s stabbings on the Las Vegas Strip. Two victims died and six others were injured in a violent incident that took place near the Wynn casino.</p>

<p>Maris DiGiovanni Jordan, 30, who was a showgirl impersonator, lost her life in the attack. She worked for a local business called Best Showgirls In Las Vegas. Cheryl Lowthorp, owner of the business, organized one of the fundraisers. For a dozen years, the firm has provided models and showgirls for promotional events.</p>
<p>It is with a heavy heart that I share that our showgirl family has been wounded beyond reason, the beautiful soul of Maris DiGiovanni has been stolen,” Lowthorp said on a GoFundMe page.</p>
<p>Three other victims also worked for the business. The fund will provide the employees with the resources they need to recover. As of midday Monday, $20,683 was raised. The goal is $250K.</p>
<p>The money will pay for medical costs, counseling for survivors, and other expenses. Those include rent, food, and other costs now that they are out of work.</p>
<p>Showgirls Out of Work</p>
<p>Best Showgirls In Las Vegas shuttered operations, at least for now, following the stabbings.</p>
<p>All of the showgirls are “afraid to return” to work, Lowthorp revealed. “Victims may not ever be able to return to work.”</p>
<p>A second GoFundMe effort will help the family of Maris DiGiovanni Jordan with final expenses. As of Monday, it had raised $45,200. The goal is $60K.</p>
<p>Money will cover funeral expenses, moving costs, travel arrangements, and related items.</p>
<p>In recalling her life, her brother told KSNV, a Las Vegas TV station, DiGiovanni grew up in Spokane, Wash. As a child, she often went sledding and made snowmen when winter weather would allow. In the summer, she enjoyed watching sunsets.</p>
<p>After completing school, she graduated from Washington State University in 2014. She and her husband, Cole Jordan, loved to travel. They visited several countries in Europe and Asia. For a while, they lived in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Then, they moved to Las Vegas. She particularly enjoyed the region’s music concerts and festivals.</p>
<p>Maris always saw the best in people, always gave them a chance, and always accepted people for who they were. Her huge capacity for love, lead her to have lasting friendships from all over the world. She was a beautiful spirit and soul, and we will miss her for the rest of our lives,” her brother said.</p>
<p>Friends, Relatives Celebrate Jordan’s Life</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, some 50 of Jordan’s friends and relatives held a candlelight vigil at the lake at Cornerstone Park in Henderson, Nev. They released lit lanterns into the air as a way to celebrate her life.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported how those gathered placed flowers, candles, and photos of Jordan on a nearby picnic table. Recollections and condolences were placed in a memorial book.</p>
<p>Music was played. Many mourners gave each other hugs. There were many tears. And there were many memories spoken.</p>
<p>“She brought a smile to your face,” recalled Jordan’s father, Vern DiGiovanni, about his daughter.</p>
<p>Maris would not want us to sit around here and cry. We’re going to cry. If you loved her, you’re going to cry,” DiGiovanni said. “But I think she would really appreciate if you took a little bit of time to look through your pictures and find those that made you smile.”</p>
<p>Hewes Sisters</p>
<p>Two of the other victims are Gabrielle “Gabby” Hewes and Cassandra “Cassy” Hewes. They are sisters.</p>
<p>Their families are facing bills because of missed work, as well as hotel and travel expenses. A GoFundMe page raised $9,255 as of Monday. The goal is $100K.</p>
<p>“Please lift these girls, as well as all of the other victims and their families, up in prayer as they heal and process this terrible tragedy,” the GoFundMe page said.</p>
