<p>Using the Games Global network, Nailed It! Games has announced the worldwide release of Cosmic Coins, a slot with the Epic Strike mechanic that honors retro AWP machines</p>
<p>The independent, 2021-founded gaming studio based in Krakow led by a “team of experts driven to lead the slot industry with innovative products”, Nailed It! Games, has announced the worldwide launch of Cosmic Coins via the Games Global network, following the exclusive release that took place on October 16.</p>
<p>The 5×3 slot with 20 paylines is a nice mix between the state-of-the-art Epic Strike mechanic that allows players to incrementally boost the prize ladder and the vintage-style amusement with prize (AWP) slot machines back in the day.</p>

<p>Epic Strike, Instant Cash Prizes, and Free Spins with Multipliers</p>
<p>The slot cleverly reunites modern-day mechanics and game features with classic ATW symbols showcasing a rich plethora of fruit icons including cherries, single, double, and triple sevens, BARS, and purple and green gems.</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols are represented by the BARs, cherries, and colored gems, which pay between 0.25x and 1x and 0.50x and 3.25x the bet.</p>
<p>The three different types of sevens are the high-paying symbols and they can generate payouts of up to 2.50x and 37.50x the bet.</p>
<p>Players must land three matching symbols to score a win. The Wild symbols are represented by diamonds and they replace the rest of the pay symbols in winning combinations.</p>
<p>The wilds also have their payouts. Players who land three wilds are rewarded with 6.25x their bet. Getting a full combination of five wilds will increase the win to 125x the bet.</p>
<p>To receive an instant cash prize, players must keep a close eye on the cosmic coin symbols and land a minimum of three anywhere on the reels.</p>
<p>The more of these symbols you can land, the faster you will progress up the incrementally increasing ladder with prizes thanks to the Epic Strike mechanic.</p>
<p>Nine cosmic coins will lead to a massive reward of 2,000x. To trigger the Free Spins round, you need at least three scatters. The fun begins with a wheel you need to spin for a chance to win up to 30 free spins featuring a 3x multiplier.</p>
<p>The bonus can be retriggered with the help of three additional scatters while engaged in the Free Spins round.</p>
<p>The Slot “Builds Anticipation for a Big Win Every Spin”</p>
<p>As explained by Nailed It! Games’ co-founder, Paweł Piotrowski, the game’s coin collection mechanic “builds anticipation for a big win” with each new spin while the multiplier of the bonus round boosts the overall winning potential.</p>
<p>Piotrowski also expressed confidence regarding the slot’s potential to appeal to all types of players thanks to the excitement it has to offer as well as the nice blend of “retro and contemporary elements”.</p>
<p>In July, the studio launched Dog Days and CatPurry, followed by Rainbow Burst in September and Grim Reaper Supermatch in October.</p>
