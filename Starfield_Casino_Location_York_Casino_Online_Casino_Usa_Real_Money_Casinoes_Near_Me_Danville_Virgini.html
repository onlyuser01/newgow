<p>QCI’s platform is being selected by more and more casino resorts all over the world thanks to its reliable nature</p>
<p>Quick Custom Intelligence (QCI), a specialist in casino and hospitality data, marketing and analytics, has unveiled a new agreement with FireKeepers Casino Hotel, a casino resort in Battle Creek, Michigan. Under the deal, QCI will supply the property with its robust data solutions.</p>
<p>As agreed by the two parties, QCI will deploy its proprietary QCI Platform throughout the FireKeepers Casino Hotel. The platform, as announced by the data company, is currently being deployed. QCI also added that the marketing, player development and casino operations team will start training in the near future.</p>
<p>The QCI Platform is famous for aligning player development, marketing and gaming with reliable real-time operational tools. Its solutions are tailored to the needs of the gaming and hospitality industries. The tools allow operators to make quick and informed decisions and navigate the dynamic casino industry while optimizing profits.</p>
<p>Thanks to the reliability of its products, QCI’s platform is now used by more than 100 casino resorts across the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and The Bahamas.</p>
<p>FireKeepers’ Leadership Was Impressed by QCI</p>
<p>BJ Bouschor, vice president of IT at FireKeepers Casino Hotel, noted that his team picked QCI as its partner following an extensive evaluation process. The operator concluded that QCI was the company that best meets the casino resort’s needs.</p>
<p>We were also impressed with their platform’s ease-of-use, scalability, and their ability to bring in so many disparate data sources into our data warehouse. BJ Bouschor, VP of IT, FireKeepers Casino Hotel</p>
<p>QCI’s chief technology officer, Andrew Cardno, also commented on the agreement with FireKeepers Casino Hotel. He said that his team is pleased about the partnership and is looking forward to helping the property manage data.</p>
<p>The QCI platform will allow FireKeepers to consolidate all of their unique data sources, including gaming and non-gaming, into one data warehouse while also leveraging the scalability of our tool to drive incremental revenue. Andrew Cardno, CTO, QCI</p>
<p>The QCI Platform continues to grow as more and more properties realize the benefits and value it brings. In February, for example, Baha Mar Casino, a luxury resort in The Bahamas selected QCI as its partner. As agreed by the two companies, QCI will help The Bahamas’ largest casino optimize its slot games.</p>
<p>In December 2022, QCI also teamed up with Black Oak Casino Resort, agreeing to help the property improve profitability. A month earlier, Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort also began installing the QCI Platform.</p>
