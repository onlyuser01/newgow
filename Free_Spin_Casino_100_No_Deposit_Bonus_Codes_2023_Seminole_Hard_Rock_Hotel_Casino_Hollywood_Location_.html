<p>Olympus Slot Review</p>
<p>Olympus is an ambitious take on Greek Mythology by the masterminds of other popular slots such as Gumball Blaster, Rich Man’s Toys, Livin Luxury, and others. Genesis Gaming has built a slot that is thematic, feature-rich, and offers a very decent 97.25% return rate that will definitely appeal to players.</p>
<p>The paytable is no easy thing, as there are many elements to it, but Olympus does play straightforwardly as you can expect from a slot game. Players get to try and produce winning combinations across 243 possible paylines, with various symbols offering a leg up the divine pecking order at any one time.</p>
<p>Olympus video slot can be played as a free play instant no download game or for real money right here on GamblingNews, or you can choose to read the review and see what this game is about first.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Zeus and Olympus</p>
<p>The theme and storyline of the game are as old as time – well, at least according to Ancient Greek mythology. The game has done a very good job of building a solid overall gameplay that feels and plays rewardingly.</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols are highly stylized letters built with fine mosaics across the wheel, and the music in the backdrop is ominous, majestic, and inspiring. You have an Olympus spelt over the main grid in big yellow leathers and an Ancient Greek-inspired font with the 243 payline symbols framing the grid to remind you what your chances of winning are.</p>
<p>The spin of the reels is easy on the eyes, and there is a sort of a small delay in pressing the spin button before the reels start swinging, with a milli-second delay from one another. This creates a more thematic experience where it seems like the reels are big slabs of marble that trickle down the 5×3 grid, and we enjoy this.</p>
<p>There are many things to speak of here, including the payouts, symbols, and design, but first, let’s check on what amounts the symbols in the game will pay you.</p>
<p>Olympus Slot Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>There are two main types of symbols you can explore in the game – the low and high-paying ones. The low-paying ones are letters and numbers such as A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9. They still offer some pretty decent payouts for five of a kind, with the payments ranging from 100 to 150 coins if you line up the maximum number of possible symbols.</p>
<p>The high-paying symbols here are designed as various deities from mythology, with Zeus clearly in the mix, and a white marble fortress perched on a rock as the highest yield symbol here with 500 coins for 5 of a kind, and possibly the home of the Gods of Olympus.</p>
<p>There are many different features that you can explore as part of your regular experience, too, as well as Scatter Symbols shaped as coins with an eye symbol in the middle and a Wild Symbol that looks like a thunderbolt. Both of these contribute to the thematic accuracy of the game but also add a layer of fun through some of the features they unlock later on.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>In terms of sounds and animations, Olympus by Genesis Gaming is a game that has hit all the intended checkboxes, bringing you joy and excitement through crips graphics, and apt sound themes. Players will hardly find any fault with the visual representation of the game and its overall immersiveness.</p>
<p>Olympus Gameplay: Throw Lightning and Thunderbolts for Extra Wins</p>
<p>Although you won’t assume the role of Zeus himself, there are still ways to access some very cool features to make the game fun and worthwhile. The overall gameplay is easy to sort as you will have full control over your bet sizes, picking anything from $0.30 to $36. You can further adjust the pace of play and set a bunch of small adjustments through the Auto Spin feature.</p>
<p>Although you can set an infinite number of spins, we don’t recommend using this feature. However, the game is also clever, because even if you did set an infinite number of re-spins, you can still set a loss limit, which means that you can step away safely from the slot, and it will automatically stop if you hit the loss limit. It’s a really cool feature that makes a lot of sense and is a credit to Genesis Gaming for implementing it.</p>
<p>Olympus Features: Love, Underworld, and Power of Zeus</p>
<p>There are several noteworthy features we ought to mention here, as they will determine how you engage with and play the Olympus video slot.</p>
<p>Free Spins: In this feature, players will have the opportunity to access several free spins that come with all sorts of extra perks attached to them. You may get anything from 15 to 25 free spins and also benefit from built-in extra levels such as Mega Retriggering, Morphing Wins, Wild Multipliers, and more.</p>
<p>Each of these Free Spins has its own unique name, including Goddess of Love, Underworld, Queen of the Heavens, Poseidon, Power of Zeus, and so on, adding thematic meaning to the overall gameplay. You can reference the paytable or just have a blast with the real money or free version of the slot machine to find out more.</p>
<p>Thunderbolt Feature: As the clouds churn and darken, thunderbolts will start falling out of the sky, with the Thunderbolt Feature turning up to five reels into Wilds that end up paying big on the paylines.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Conquer Mount Olympus with Free Spins and More!</p>
<p>Genesis Gaming has a good reputation for building solid games that stand the test of time. Inspired by a common theme, Olympus is a slot game that delivers and makes sure that its gameplay is easy to differentiate and stand out. The branching Free Spins feature is a nice touch that will keep you on your toes as to what cool reward may be waiting for you just around the corner!</p>
