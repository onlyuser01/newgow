    <h1>Casino Free Bonus No Deposit Casinos In Dallas Texas Okada Manila Casino Casino In Charleston West V</h1>

<p>I HAVE ADHERED TO ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>
<p>I AM REGISTERED AND VERIFIED WITH ZARCASINO.</p>
<p>I HAVE HAD 2 BONUSES AWARDED (ONE AUTHORISED AND ONE UNAUTHORISED)</p>
<p>BONUS AUTHORISED AND FULLY ADHERED TO AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON COMPLETION/END - (AMOUNT: R350.00 - REFERECE NUMBER: 4808227)</p>
<p>BONUS UNAUTHORISED AND UNWANTED BY MYSELF AFTER DEPOSITTING R250.00(DEPOSIT REFERENCE NUMBER: 2409584 - (UNAUTHORISED AND UNWANTED BONUS R500.00 - REFRENCE NUMBER: 4859044)</p>
<p>I STRUGGLED WITH GETTING AN UNAUTHORISED AND UNWANTED BONUS OF R500.00(BONUS NO. 4859044) TO BE TAKEN OFF MY ACCOUNT AS I DID NOT WANT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ALONG WITH TAKING THE BONUS, NOR DID I ASK OR AUTHORISE THIS BONUS. I WAS MET WITH A LOT OF BACKLASH ,REFUSAL AND THREATS FROM ZARCASINO(THREAT: TAKING AWAY ALL MY WINNINGS OF R5141.86) IF THEY FIXED THEIR OWN UNAUTHORISED ERROR BY REMOVING THE R500.00 BONUS THEY ADDED WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.</p>
<p>EVENTUALLY THEY AGREED AND REMOVED ONLY THE UNAUTHORISED AND UNWATED BONUS OF R500.00, AFTER I MADE THEM AWARE THAT WOULD REPORT THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.</p>
<p>I WAS ASSURED MULTIPLE TIMES FROM ZAR CASINO THAT THIS UNAUTHORISED AND UNWANTED AMOUNT WAS REMOVED(NOT FORFETEID- AS A FORFEIT WOULD MEAN I AUTHORISED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE) AND ALSO THE ONLY REMOVED AMOUNT/BONUS.</p>
<p>I THEN CHECKED MY STATEMENTS ONLINE AND SAW THAT THEY HAVE FORFEITED BOTH MY BONUSES UPON MY WITHDRAWAL OF R5141.86 AND RMOVED A TOTAL OF R4791.86 FROM MY ACCOUNT,AND DEPOSITED A TOTAL OF R350.00 INTO MY BANK ACCOUNT ( WHICH COVENIENLTY HAS NO TRACE ON THE ZAR ONLINE ACCOUNT STATEMENTS) I DO HOWEVER HAVE A PROOF OF PAYMENT.</p>
<p>THEY ARE DENYING THAT THEY HAVE MADE 2 UNAUTHORSIED ADJUSTMENTS AND 1 OUTRIGHT LIE WHILE ACCESSIG AND CHANGING ALL MY AMOUNTS WITHREGARDS TO MY MONEY IN MY ZARCASINO ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>1.UNAUTHORISED ADDITION OF R500.00 BONUS</p>
<p>2.UNAUTHORISED FORFEIT OF COMPLETED TERMS AND CONSITIONS OF FIRST BONUS(R350.00) EVER CLAIMED AND COMLETED IN ALL ASPECTS TO ALLOW ME MY FULL WITHDRAWAL OF WINNINGS TOTAL (4791.86 OUTSTANDING AND OWED TO ME)</p>
<ol>
<li>LYING THAT ONLY THEIR UNAUTHORISED ACTIONS WITHOUT MY AGREEMENT WAS DONE CORRECTLY AND REMOVED AS IVE ASKED.</li>
</ol>
<p>(PROMISING TO REMOVE ONLY THE BONUS OF R500, I DID NOT AUTHORISE AND CONTINUING TO PROCCEED TO REMOVE EVERYTHING INCLUDING COMPLETED BONUS OF R350 AND MY WINNINGS)</p>
<p>BEST REGARDS</p>
