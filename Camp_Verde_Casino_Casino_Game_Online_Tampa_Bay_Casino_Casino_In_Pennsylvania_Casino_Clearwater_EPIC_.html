    <h1>Camp Verde Casino Casino Game Online Tampa Bay Casino Casino In Pennsylvania Casino Clearwater EPIC</h1>

<p>EPIC Risk Management has extended its support for Nathan Quarless, a respected boxer, in a bid to promote a safer gambling message among young athletes. Up-and-coming athletes have been particularly susceptible to the dangers of problem gambling and gambling harm, issues that EPIC Risk Management addresses both in analytical as well as preventative capacity.</p>
<p>Tackling Gambling Harm in Sports</p>
<p>The company has picked Quarless as a bright face of the talented crop of young boxers to help drive a responsible gambling message with other athletes and the broader fandom. The 26-year-old cruiserweight fighter has been undefeated so far and has proven a good partner to EPIC over the past two years, helping other young athletes and their fans educate themselves about the pitfalls of gambling.</p>
<p>EPIC is focused on leveraging its partnership with Quarless to highlight the issues of problem gambling and gambling-related harm, using the athlete’s likeness to inspire others to be constantly vigilant of those undermining issues.</p>
<p>Commenting on the extended partnership, EPIC founder and CEO Paul Buck praised Quarless ability to serve as a role model and advocate for positive recovery:</p>
<p>“We are delighted to extend our relationship with Nathan and can’t wait to enjoy the journey with him as his professional career goes from strength to strength.” EPIC founder and CEO Paul Buck</p>
<p>Quarless Story Is One of Change</p>
<p>Quarless himself has been deeply involved with promoting a responsible gambling message. He has worked with the Beacon Counselling Trust, which focuses on tackling gambling-related harms. Quarless’ relationship with EPIC started on a personal note as well.</p>
<p>He was helping with the launch of the Gambling Harms North West Alliance and spoke about gambling harm, which caught the attention of Buck who contacted the boxer afterwards and offered to assist him with his boxing career:</p>
<p>“We didn’t end up networking on the day, but afterward, Paul got in touch with me through Twitter to tell me how much I’d inspired him and how he’d like to meet up. He ended up sponsoring me in boxing and we have become good friends from that day on.” Boxer Nathan Quarless</p>
<p>Quarless’ experience with gambling addiction is important because he struggled with it as a teenager, but has overcome it and through EPIC’s backing, he has become an inspirational figure for change in sports. EPIC is the first dedicated consultancy fully focused on minimizing gambling-related harm.</p>
