    <h1>New Jersey Casinos Slots Plus Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Walker Bluff Casino Best Casin</h1>

<p>Dear hirokingmm,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>3.4 An account must be opened in order to bet with BetRebels. The client must use their own personal credit or debit card in order to open an account. Proof of identity, in the form of a photocopy of the card(s) (front and back), together with the photocopy of an identity document, must be forwarded by fax or email at documents@betrebels.com. In order to prevent money laundering, proof of identity may be also be requested when utilising other forms of payment.</p>
<p>4.10 An Account Holder can only make a deposit with his personal Card. Credit / Debit Card transactions are subject to a limit of €2300 per transaction. If you want to deposit more you have to split the amount on multiple transactions. Kindly note that we do not accept Credit / Debit Card transactions from certain countries. A Credit / Debit card registered with a BetRebels account cannot be utilised on another. Please note that deposit limits apply. Limits will increase upon presentation of the required documentation. Transactions on the Credit / Debit Card Cardsholder's Statement will appear as Rebels Gaming Ltd. If the user has deposited funds with a Credit / Debit Card, and subsequently requests a withdrawal the funds withdrawn will be returned to the same Credit / Debit Card. All Credit / Debit Card payments are processed by Rebels Gaming Ltd.</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players:</p>
<p>Payments</p>
<p>For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations.</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that ou used a third-party payment method to withdraw your winnings?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
