<p>Blueprint Gaming was awarded a license to operate as a recognized supplier in Ontario, Canada back inApril. Now, the company is expanding its reach in the province through a new partnership with NorthStar Bets, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>The partnership will see numerous of Blueprint’s high-performing, branded, and engaging titles make it into the province with the operator. Among them are games such as Sausage Party, The Goonies, ted, and more. In April, 50 of Blueprint’s games were approved by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario.</p>
<p>The latest partnership covers those titles, as well as a selection of Megaways games, Wolf Legends, Eye of Horus, and not least, Fishing Frenzy: The Big Catch. Both companies expect the full portfolio of the supplier’s games to eventually go live with NorthStar all the same.</p>
<p>Blueprint is particularly confident in the success of some of its leading titles. Blueprint Gaming Director of Key Accounts and Marketing UK Jo Purvis hailed the opportunity to expand in what the company sees as a key market.</p>
<p>"Partnering with NorthStar Bets will play a considerable role in our growth there going forward and puts our slots in front of an impressive swathe of new players," Purvis said.</p>
<p>The jackpot King progressive jackpot system and the Deal or No Deal branded game are two of the particularly well-performing solutions developed by Blueprint Gaming and developed for players in the North American market.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming also benefits from the partnership as NorthStar Bets is a Canadian-based and owned brand, which means that the operator is particularly well-aware of local market needs. NorthStar Gaming CEO and founding partner Michael Moskowitz were similarly upbeat about the partnership and its long-term implications.</p>
<p>Moskowitz said that his company was happy to drive unique content to local players and deliver a premium gaming experience for consumers. He further added that NorthStar Gaming is committed to growing its offer in Ontario through the NorthStar Bets brand, and to get there – the company will keep teaming up with leading suppliers.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming has had successes of its own. The company signed a partnership with Light &amp; Wonder in October. NorthStar Bets has already had several partnerships with prominent suppliers of iGaming products over the past months. One of those was with Pragmatic Play, signed in November.</p>
