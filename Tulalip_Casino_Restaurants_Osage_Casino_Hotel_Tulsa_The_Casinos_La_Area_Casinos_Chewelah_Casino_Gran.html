    <h1>Tulalip Casino Restaurants Osage Casino Hotel Tulsa The Casinos La Area Casinos Chewelah Casino Gran</h1>

<p>I initially placed in a Freeroll tournament and was awarded a $25 prize. The casino requires a $100 minimum for Bitcoin withdrawal.</p>
<p>So I played my $25 into $100. I am not restricted by any playthrough or "bonus" terms for withdrawal</p>
<p>My issue has been with their KYC Verification process. They added additional unstated required documents that are not included in their "Required Documents" T&amp;C.</p>
<p>They first denied my proof of address documents, which were issued by the US Government and one from the State of Florida. Citing as a reason that they could not see the 4th corner of the pages (on a white background).</p>
<p>I used the same docs to verify at (5) other casinos. So I could not retake the photos bc the docs had been discarded.</p>
<p>They also took issue with a photo requested of me "Holding my ID, next to, above or below my face in a photo" Which is not even noted in their required documents section. I've resubmitted these photos (3) separate times. Each time waited the full 3-5 business days for a reply. And was told they were not "legible".</p>
<p>They not only have a close up photo of my ID front and back, but now they have at least (10) photos of me holding my ID. All of which you cab read my name, address, the issue and expiration date my birthday), and these all match my casino profile exactly.</p>
<p>They finally accepted (3) bank statements as proof of address. But I am in the 3-5 day waiting period for approval of the ID holding photo. Again ....I even used a mirror to take the photos so that the ID would be crystal clear and even more plain to read.....they said no.</p>
<p>I have offered to video call them, and verify anything they would like. I've offered to show them location via social media applications, most of which are 10 year old profiles that are clearly mine.</p>
<p>Even more humorous, I currently have the exact same hairstyle and beard growth as the ID photo, even though it's 5 years old and not expired until 2028. It's comical bc I literally look exactly the same as the photo.</p>
<p>In the chat option they refuse to assist or provide any contact info for management when requested. I included in my email, they're option to simply input my driver's license number into the Florida DL Check Website, run bbmy the state. Which will validate my residence and identity beyond any capability I would have to falsify it.</p>
<p>They will not entertain any of my suggestions to resolve the matter. At all. So this has progressed from December 5th 2023- January 8th 2023. And my withdrawal can not even be requested until this approval is accepted.</p>
<p>I've been on chat with them last night as well as this morning. No changes or updates. Just told me to continue to wait. Also I'm sure once I do actually Request to Withdraw, they will have me waiting another 2-3 weeks for a Bitcoin transfer.</p>
<p>I'd rather not include my personal info in any screen shots posted with this complaint, but I will send them to you privately if you'd like to personally see what I mean.</p>
<p>Thanks again. I hope you can help.</p>
