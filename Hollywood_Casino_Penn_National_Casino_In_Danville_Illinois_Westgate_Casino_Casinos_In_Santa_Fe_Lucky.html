<p>Wynn Resorts Ltd. has announced the appointment of Julie Cameron-Doe as its new chief financial officer. Cameron-Doe will step into her new position in the second quarter of 2022 as she is currently winding down from her responsibilities as CFO at Aristocrat Leisure Ltd. She is a long-standing industry veteran whose experience spans numerous companies.</p>
<p>Outgoing Aristocrat CFO to Join Wynn Resorts Team</p>
<p>Cameron-Doe will be taking over from outgoing CFO Craig Billings who will be stepping in as company CEO in light of the former chief executive’s decision to leave Wynn Resorts. As Matt Maddox will no longer be with Wynn, the company has decided to overhaul its structure bringing external talent. Commenting on her appointment, Billings said:</p>
<p>“She is the clear choice for this position and her appointment rounds out our senior executive team. We are indeed fortunate to have her join us next year.” Wynn Resorts CFO Craig Billings</p>
<p>Cameron-Doe has been with Aristocrat since 2018 and she will leverage her diverse experience to help advance the Wynn brand and name. Her career path has taken her through numerous mastodons, including The Walt Disney Company, KPMG, and Orbitz.</p>
<p>Cameron-Doe welcomed the news to be joining Wynn Resorts, arguing that the company was a gold standard in its respective sector. She equally welcomed the opportunity to join Billings’ team and the rest of the executives at Wynn Resorts. In her role as a chief financial officer, Cameron-Doe will look to help the company sustain its momentum and achieve further growth.</p>
<p>Aristocrat also confirmed Cameron-Doe’s departure in an ASX filing with company chief executive Trevor Croker commenting on her decision, which he regrated, but also respected. Croker added that he will be working with Cameron-Doe to smooth the transition as she ventures into her new position with Wynn Resorts.</p>
