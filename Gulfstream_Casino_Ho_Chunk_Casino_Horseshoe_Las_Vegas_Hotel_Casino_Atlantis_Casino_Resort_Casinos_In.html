<p>Historical Horse Racing continues to enjoy a lot of popularity in Kentucky. Seeing the popularity HHR has in the state, two companies have decided to open new HHR venues.</p>
<p>Kentucky Bettors Adore HHR Machines</p>
<p>HHR machines are slot-like machines that use data from horse races to determine the outcome of a player’s bet. These machines are people’s preferred way to play in Kentucky, according to data from the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.</p>
<p>The commission reported that players bet a whopping $6.8 million on the state’s 5,569 machines during the previous fiscal year. This stellar handle resulted in revenue of $592 for operators of HHR cabinets. In addition, HHR machines contributed over $102 million to local taxes, which fueled thoroughbred racing and the Bluegrass State’s general fund.</p>
<p>Two New HHR Parlors to Open</p>
<p>Thanks to the popularity of HHR in Kentucky, two companies have vowed to open new parlors with HHR machines.</p>
<p>The first of the new venues will be operated by Churchill Downs, a leading horse racing company. The parlor is located at Turfway Park, a famous horse racing track near Florence. It will be equipped with 800 HHR machines and will engage local customers with the racing content they love. In addition, two restaurants will provide visitors with a place to dine and socialize.</p>
<p>The second venue is located in Williamsburg and is a joint venture between Kentucky Downs and Keeneland. This so-called Mint Gaming Hall will be armed with 450 HHR machines and will also have a restaurant and a bar. Most importantly, the venue will be the first historical horse racing hub in Eastern Kentucky. It will serve as a satellite facility for an upcoming racing track in Corbin.</p>
<p>HHR Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Many experts consider HHR to be a boon, because of the money they contribute to the local economy and the ecosystem they have created. The presence of historical horse racing machines has brought more money to the horse racing sector, which, in turn, has popularized the sport and attracted more jockeys.</p>
<p>The two new venues will collectively add 1250 new machines. However, Kentucky companies don’t plan to stop there. Analysts predict that hundreds, if not thousands of machines will be installed at various locations across Kentucky within the next few years.</p>
<p>For example, Churchill Downs’ Derby City in Louisville will soon undergo a $76 million expansion that will see the venue equipped with 200 HHR machines and will leave space for 200 more. Meanwhile, Churchill Downs plans to also build a new $80 million HHR parlor in Downtown Louisville. Revolutionary Racing, on the other hand, seeks to open a new $55 million quarter horse track in Ashland. The company plans to arm its new venue with 400 HHR machines.</p>
