    <h1>Coushatta Casino Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Columbus Meskwaki Casino Doubledown Casino Bonus Colle</h1>

<p>One of the leading gambling industry solutions providers, Gaming Innovation Group, has secured a new milestone with the launch of its platform through Bplay in Mendoza, Argentina. This step further empowers the company as it seeks to consolidate its presence in the Latin American region, and specifically strengthens Boldt Group-owned Bplay’s presence in the country.</p>
<p>The recent move marks the fifth such launch in Argentina for Bplay where iGaming and betting permits are granted on a province-by-province basis. Bplay previously launched in the City of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe,Entre Ríos and Buenos Aires, all of which are considered separate jurisdictions that require applicants to pass a rigorous licensing process. Through Bplay, the two companies continue to strengthen their market presence and deliver the experiences that are sought out by local players.</p>
<p>According to an official press release, GiG has already had a tangible impact on Bplay’s presence in Argentina, with gross gaming revenue increasing significantly in the year between May 2022 and May 2023, owing to the group’s outstanding sportsbook solutions. Commenting on this new opportunity, GiG Commercial Director David Bonnefous Saavedra hailed the significance of this new partnership and what it meant for the two companies:</p>
<p>Our excellent relationship with the Boldt Group and the continuing expansion of our original deal, highlights the strength of our Platform, technology, and managed services teams.</p>
<p>Saavedra said that GiG has been actively working to exceed partner expectations and help explore every growth opportunity. He further noted that GiG’s ability to provide immaculate service to companies such as Bplay positioned the company in a prime position in the B2B vertical.</p>
<p>The news of GiG strengthening ties with Bplay and helping with the launch of the website in Mendoza was also welcomed by Grupo Boldt Business Unit Manager José del Pino who added: "Bplay continues to provide the best gaming experience for our clients in Latin America, leading not only in the launch of new licenses, incorporating new and great games and products, but also improving user satisfaction."</p>
<p>GiG has been strengthening its presence and reputation by providing some of the world’s leading brands with top-notch software. In a similar move in Germany, the company confirmed that it would be powering Betsson’s Rizk casino brand. The company has also provided a range of services that help strengthen the operational and compliance capacity of partner operators, with Bplay being no exception.</p>
