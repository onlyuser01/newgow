<p>Rumbolz pointed out that Nutton is expected to bring strategic counsel which is ultimately going to help the company improve its products. This, in turn, will likely boost Everi’s profits and global footprint. “Debra joins us at an opportune time to assist with the expansive growth opportunities that we expect will take Everi to even greater prominence in coming years,” said Rumbolz in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome Debra to Everi and believe her distinguished record of gaming achievements and leadership make her an exceptional addition to the Company’s Board of Directors.“ Michael Rumbolz, executive chairman of the Board of Everi</p>
<p>Overall, Nutton’s professional experience within the gaming vertical spans over four decades. Her background includes an executive vice president of casino operations role for Wynn Las Vegas. She held that role between 2013 and 2018.</p>
<p>At the time, she also consulted the company for the upcoming opening of Encore Boston Harbor. Nutton also played a key role by providing strategic advice for the Resorts World Las Vegas property that opened in 2021.</p>
<p>Nutton’s professional career includes a board member position with Global Gaming Women, as well as an Advisory Board role with Global Gaming Expo (G2E). In addition, she was also a part of MGM Resorts, where she held the role of senior vice president of casino operations.
