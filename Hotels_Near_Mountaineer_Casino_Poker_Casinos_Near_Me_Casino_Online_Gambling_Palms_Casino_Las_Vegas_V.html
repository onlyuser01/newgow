<p>There are many possible wagers you can place in the NBA, and knowing all there is about each separate one would help you to really get ahead in the game. The type of bet you pick will naturally have a bearing on how successful you are as a sports bettor. In fact, the best NBA betting sites will make sure they cover the full variety of bet types available. We will now list them for your convenience.</p>
<p>Moneylines: Pick Your Favorite</p>
<p>Moneylines are a simple type of wager where you pick a single team and back them up to win. There are no additional conditions you need to cover other than the team you root for winning the game. The moneyline is usually written with a (+) or a (-) in front of them to denote the favorite and underdog.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you bet $100 on the underdog to win the amount in (+). So, if the Boston Celtics are +140, this means they are not the most likely team to win. In this case, you will get $140 for every $100 you wager (or, equally, $1.40 for every $1) on the Celtics to win, and if they do.</p>
<p>If you bet on the Houston Rockets to win -140, you need to spend $140 to win back $100. That is how moneyline basketball betting works, and it’s very easy to get into. Having trouble reading the moneyline? Don’t worry – check out our guide on how to read betting odds.</p>
<p>Point Spreads: Threading the Needle</p>
<p>Point spreads wagers are an interesting type of sports betting. In it, you will see points assigned or detracted from the final score in an NBA game. However, online sportsbooks only do so to settle a score. How does this work, then? Well, let’s take the following example:</p>
<p>Brooklyn Nets +2</p>
<p>Los Angeles Lakers -2</p>
<p>In this case, you are betting on the spread that the Los Angeles Lakers would win with at least a two-point difference. If the final score is Nets (106) and LA Lakers (107), then the person betting on the +2 spread wins. They have bet that the lakers would win within two points, and the spread is then added to the final score to settle the wager. Then, you get the Nets (108) and the Lakers (105) following this logic. It’s really simple! A point spread can get you ahead in your betting game if you know when to use it.</p>
<p>Totals: Guess the Score, Not the Winner</p>
<p>Totals are another unique bet type to explore. In this case, you won’t be guessing on which team is going to win, but rather whether the score will be over or under a given number. If you guess correctly, you seal the bet and cash out. The betting odds for totals can be quite a bit of fun as well, allowing you to explore different conditions when you bet on NBA games.</p>
<p>Props: Bet on All You Know</p>
<p>Props are one of the most entertaining markets when it comes to online NBA betting. In this case, you won’t bet on traditional markets such as who wins or what the total score is, but rather try to guess what player would score the most points in a quarter of the game or overall. Actually, there is no real guidance on the props bets.</p>
<p>The rivalry between James Harden and Stephen Curry produced a number of interesting betting lines in 2019, and the top NBA betting websites did make sure to cover many great selections. You will find all sorts of cool props, such as who would have the most assists or rebounds and whether a player is going to have a tantrum fit or get injured, or even fake an injury.</p>
<p>There really is no limit on how many different prop bets you may have, which makes NBA betting lines all that more fun.</p>
<p>Parlays: Bet on All, Win All</p>
<p>Parlays are a great way to use a small amount of money and build high-yield bet slips. The premise here is simple. Make at least two selections and combine them in a single bet. If all selections turn out a success, you get your money, and even a small amount of money can bring you a handsome reward.</p>
<p>The more selections you keep adding, the better the potential reward gets, but so does the risk of missing increases as well. Even if a single selection fails, your entire parlay wager is forfeited, so keep this in mind!</p>
<p>Futures: Call a Winner Early</p>
<p>A future bet on NBA games means that you are placing your wagers early and often without being aware of everything. If you bet in mid-season on the winner of the NBA championship, you are clearly acting on more information than you would if you bet before the regular season even started.</p>
<p>Placing future bets earlier, though, means that you can benefit from better NBA odds and squeeze better value if you are able to call the outcome at the onset of the season. Naturally, acting on imperfect information is not the best strategy in any type of sports betting, but future bets do happen a lot.</p>
<p>In-play Betting</p>
<p>Basketball fans love to participate in live betting contests. A live or in-play market means that you can bet on events in real-time, and this is often the most preferred way of placing a wager. After mobile, basketball bettors are now more actively looking into live betting options even if they don’t understand them entirely.</p>
<p>However, such in-play markets add a lot of entertainment value and allow you to participate in the so-called micro-markets, such as backing whether an attack would result in a point scored. The decisions here are made in split seconds, and they require a deeper level of engagement that sportsbooks naturally welcome and players enjoy because it gives them an additional way to feel a part of the action at the court.</p>
