<p>On-demand and streaming platform DAZN or Da Zone definitely made waves when it first announced that it was entering the sports betting space. This move was not entirely unexpected, given that the company was able to poach ex-Entain CEO Shay Segev bringing him on board as the sole Chief Executive in January.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has been aggressively picking talent from the iGaming vertical and unabashedly securing the best and brightest the industry has to offer. This is the case with former Casumo executive Pete Everson who is joining as Head of Talent Acquisition ahead of the official sportsbook launch that is due in the third quarter of this year. In a LinkedIn update, the executive said:</p>
<p>"I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as head of talent acquisition at DAZN Bet."</p>
<p>He assured that DAZN Bet will be looking to grow its team rapidly over the coming weeks and months to meet the high expectations for the brand and its imminent launch.</p>
<p>Everson’s experience with his previous company, Casumo, will prove invaluable to DAZN Bet as the company prepares to make its first foray into the sports betting space as an active supplier of odds, fixtures, and wagering opportunities.</p>
<p>He served as acquisition partner in Casumo in 2019 and then transitioned to Head of People a year after he was hired. Everson’s career path also saw him work with Betsson where he was also assisting with various recruitment initiatives, making him well-versed in this particular aspect of the business.</p>
<p>As part of DAZN Bet, he will have one of his biggest career opportunities to date, helping the company steer in the highly-contested and lucrative sports betting market. There have been a number of heavyweights appointed to the executive lineup of the sportsbook already.</p>
<p>These include former BoyleSports CEO Mark Kemp who was appointed as Chief Executive Officer for DAZN Bet. Other people who have since joined include former Betdaq Managing Director Shane McLaughlin who has been tasked with overseeing DAZN Bet’s operations as Managing Director for the United Kingdom and Ontario. Matt Harington was appointed head of legal by the company.</p>
<p>But the talent pool is not drying up with these appointments. The company has been able to appoint Simon Gatenby as its Chief Marketing Officer. Gatenby did stints at Entain and William Hill and understands the ins and outs of the industry quite well.</p>
