<p>German Bundesliga is the only major competition that’s on the program this weekend. There are five matches on Saturday, each of which has huge importance for the teams involved.</p>
<p>Nothing is yet certain in the German top tier, which promises a lot of excitement on the pitch. If you’d like to amplify the excitement even more, why not put some money on Saturday’s games? Our Bundesliga betting preview will help you make the right picks!</p>
<p>Borussia Monchengladbach vs Bayer Leverkusen</p>
<p>The game takes place at the Borussia-Park in Monchengladbach, where the host had won 29 points in 13 matches before Bundesliga was suspended.</p>
<p>Borussia Monchengladbach is famous for relying on fan support, so the fact that this game is played in front of an empty stadium can be a major disadvantage.</p>
<p>The home stands are filling up nicely though! Over 4,500 cut-outs in place and 12,000+ ordered 😍</p>
<p>The website is now live in English too to give our international fans a chance to order their cut-out for €19.00 via bank transfer! 🐎💚</p>

<p>The club has decided to create as a ‘real feel’ as possible by putting cardboard cutouts of fans in the stands. Borussia Monchengladbach supporters have already created more than 12,000 cardboard cutouts with their photos on them.</p>
<p>Whether the makeshift fans can put the wind in the sails of Borussia’s players remains the question, especially knowing that they’re facing a very tough opponent on Saturday.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that Bayer Leverkusen has been their nemesis in a previous couple of years. For instance, the last time these two played at the Borussia-Park, the Company’s Eleven won by 5:0.</p>
<p>Going against their Kryptonite without the help of the fans probably isn’t going to end well for Borussia Monchengladbach. The visiting team should take all three points.</p>
<p>Pick: Bayer Leverkusen +171</p>
<p>Bayern Munich vs Eintracht Frankfurt</p>
<p>Bayern Munich is four points ahead of the second-placed Borussia Dortmund at the moment. The two will meet next Tuesday in ‘Der Klassiker’ which is why it’s very important for Bayern to maintain that point gap. For that, they need to win all three points against Eintracht.</p>
<p>Just by looking at the Bundesliga table, it’s easy to figure out which team is the favorite. The table leader is taking on the team from the 13th place.</p>
<p>Bookies know this as well, which is why the odds on the reigning champion of Bundesliga are only -625. To spice things up, it’s better to focus on goals – there should be a lot of them!</p>
<p>Bayern Munich has scored 75 so far, which is more than any other team in the league. In their first post-lockdown game, Bayern beat Union Berlin by 2:0, which isn’t impressive by this team’s standards.</p>
<p>This time, however, it could be different. Bayern is facing the team that’s lost four Bundesliga games in a row, allowing 13 goals along the way.</p>
<p>Still, the main reason why we expect goals galore here is that Bayern Munich is looking for revenge. The last time these two went toe-to-toe, Eintracht won by 5:1.</p>
<p>In their meeting before that one, the game finished by the same score, albeit in Bayern’s favor. Something similar will probably happen this Saturday as well.</p>
<p>Pick: Bayern Munich (-625); Over 3.5 Goals (-115)</p>
<p>Other Matches to Check Out</p>
<p>Wolfsburg vs Borussia Dortmund</p>
<p>Three hours before Bayern Munich players get on the pitch, their biggest rival for the title, Borussia Dortmund, is playing Wolfsburg.</p>
<p>The game is played in Wolfsburg, but an easy win for Borussia Dortmund is expected. The reason? Borussia is a way better team. The BVB is also in a fantastic form – Haaland and his teammates run over Schalke in the previous round.</p>
<p>Finally, Dortmund also has a very good history with Wolfsburg, with no defeats since 2015.</p>
<p>Pick: Borussia Dortmund (-137)</p>
<p>Freiburg vs Werder Bremen</p>
<p>Things don’t look very well for Werder Bremen. Unless this team gets in a winning form ASAP, we’ll probably see them playing in Bundesliga II the next season. Werder needs points, but knowing how poor this team has been (especially at the back), they’ll have to wait a while longer.</p>
<p>Pick: Freiburg (+215)</p>
<p>Paderborn vs Hoffenheim</p>
<p>Extreme times require extreme measures. As Paderborn is at the very bottom of the table, this team has no other option but to try to win all three points in this match.</p>
<p>Even though they’re facing a much better team, Paderborn will have to attack. In turn, that will leave room for Hoffenheim’s counter-attacks, so we can expect goals on both ends.</p>
<p>Pick: Both Teams To Score (-200)</p>
