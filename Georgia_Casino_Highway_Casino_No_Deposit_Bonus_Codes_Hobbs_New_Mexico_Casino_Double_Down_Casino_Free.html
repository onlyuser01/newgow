<p>withdrawal and verification still not processed</p>
<p>Dealing with Electric Spins has been an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience. I strongly believe that their practices are questionable and warrant reporting to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Unfortunately, they seem unwilling to disclose the identity of the regulator responsible for overseeing their operations, further adding to the difficulties faced by customers.</p>
<p>One of the major issues with Electric Spins is their lack of transparency. It is astonishing that they refuse to provide information about the regulatory body governing their operations. This unwillingness to disclose such crucial details raises serious concerns about their integrity and compliance with industry standards. Customers should have the right to know who is supervising the company's activities and ensuring their adherence to fair practices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Electric Spins exhibits a complete disregard for efficient and customer-friendly processes. Dealing with the company is an absolute nightmare. Their processes are convoluted, inefficient, and seemingly designed to create obstacles for customers rather than providing a seamless experience. From my personal experience, it is evident that their procedures are plagued with unnecessary delays, poor communication, and a general lack of professionalism.</p>
<p>The absence of clear channels for addressing concerns is another significant drawback. When attempting to resolve issues or seek clarification, the lack of responsiveness from Electric Spins is appalling. Customers are left feeling ignored and helpless, with no clear path for escalation or resolution. This kind of dismissive attitude towards customer support is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>Considering all these factors, I strongly advise others to steer clear of Electric Spins. Their refusal to disclose the regulatory authority overseeing their operations, coupled with their abysmal processes and lack of customer support, highlights a company that fails to prioritize transparency, accountability, and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Electric Spins' difficult-to-deal-with nature, combined with their refusal to disclose the regulator responsible for overseeing their practices, merits reporting their practices to the relevant authorities. I strongly recommend potential customers to avoid engaging with this company until they demonstrate a commitment to transparency and improve their processes significantly.</p>
