<p>The launch of Dog Days exclusively focuses on a select number of prominent operators. This is done two weeks ahead of the network launch which will give companies at select brands and casinos, including LeoVegas, Betsson, and Kindred, the chance to try the game before anyone else.</p>
<p>A Taste of the Game Before Its Mass Release</p>
<p>The launch also covers multiple jurisdictions, owing to the partner operators’ reach, and Dog Days will be available in the United Kingdom and Canada, but also in Brazil and elsewhere. Nailed It! Games believe that the game will enjoy commercial and critical acclaim and become an easily-recognizable and player-favourite title before long, as demos of the game at CasinoBeats were already well-received and helped boost Dog Days’ overall profile.</p>
<p>The game itself features five reels and three different types of bets. Players can further tinker with some of the mechanics, offering them a little more wiggle room when it comes to customizing the title. For example, players may end up picking the number of wilds.</p>
<p>Dog Days naturally comes with all the bells and whistles expected from any top-performing title these days, including free spins and bonus games. The game has also been designed to help partner studios retain and attract players to their platforms, creating excellent experiences across the board.</p>
<p>Nailed It! Games co-founder Paweł Piotrowski has welcomed the opportunity to see Dog Days launched with an exclusive selection of operators in a bid to strengthen the title’s reach and boost awareness for it:</p>
<p>Simultaneously offering Dog Days as an exclusive to numerous different partners across various jurisdictions demonstrates the impact our titles are having in markets around the world and the incredible interest operators have in being the sole platform to host this feature-rich game. Nailed It! Games co-founder Paweł Piotrowski</p>
<p>Nailed It! Games in Position to Conquer iGaming</p>
<p>Piotrowski confirmed that the company was very happy to see this game and project come to fruition and Nailed It! Games was now patiently awaiting to gauge player response with the exclusive partners and the wider network release next.</p>
<p>Operating as an independent studio, Nailed It! Games still has some proving to do, but the company has already been establishing itself as a designer of excellent and player-focused games. Recently, the company brought in Mauro Dos Santos as a business development manager.</p>
<p>Nailed It! Games has already a busy pipeline of releases including Gold Mine Stacks, Book of Fate and Gold Mine Stacks 2 all of which were released in the first quarter of the year.</p>
