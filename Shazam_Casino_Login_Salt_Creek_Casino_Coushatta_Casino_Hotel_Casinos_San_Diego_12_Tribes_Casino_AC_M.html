<p>Associazione Calcio Milan, the famous professional soccer club based in Milan, Italy, that is also popular as AC Milan, unveiled two important partnerships earlier this week. The soccer club revealed that it joined forces with the gambling operator with a presence in Turkey, Sekabet. Under the terms of the new deal, AC Milan designated the operator as its Official Regional Betting Partner in the country.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, AC Milan and soccer fans in Turkey will be able to benefit from exclusive content, win exclusive prizes and engage in unique money-can't-buy experiences. The deal between the duo is expected to start with a multi-platform promotional campaign that is scheduled to coincide with the start of the 2023-2024 season, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>For Sekabet, the new high-profile partnership with AC Milan is expected to help the company expand its footprint in Turkey. Currently, the country has a passionate Rossoneri fanbase that will be able to experience unique thrills and activations thanks to the new collaboration. Since its launch in 2015, Sekabet has been growing rapidly in Turkey, but the new deal is expected to provide a further boost for the operator.</p>
<p>Andreas Zimmerman, Sekabet's CEO, shared his excitement about the new collaboration, acknowledging that soccer is a sport with millions of fans. "At Sekabet, we have always strived to transcend the ordinary in the betting industry. Known for offering some of the highest odds in the market, we ensure that our users get the best value for their bets," he added.</p>
<p>Finally, Zimmerman pointed out: "Our partnership with AC Milan, a Club with an illustrious history and passionate fanbase, is a reflection of our dedication to excellence and signifies our commitment to bringing unparalleled experiences to fans worldwide."</p>
<p>Besides the deal with Sekabet, AC Milan announced a new Asia-facing deal. This week, the famous soccer team joined forces with Leyu Sports, the popular sports entertainment brand for the region. Under the terms of that deal, the brand was dedicated as the Rossoneri's Official Betting Partner in Asia.</p>
<p>Committed to delivering thrilling experiences for customers within the Asian region, Leyu Sports will now bring elevated excitement and thrilling activations for its soccer fans. The new collaboration will see the duo join forces for the development of different activations, including engaging sports content. While the new partnership is expected to solidify Leyu Sports' position in Asia, it is also expected to increase the popularity of AC Milan, allowing the soccer team to reach new fans.</p>
