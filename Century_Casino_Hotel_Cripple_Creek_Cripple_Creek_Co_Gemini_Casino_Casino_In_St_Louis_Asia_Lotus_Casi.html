<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a supplier which is present in more than 20 regulated markets and has been one of the powerhouses in online casinos since 2018, has established a new prominent partnership which coincides with a market entry for the studio.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Hacksaw Gaming titles will be available to Bulgarian customers thanks to a content tie-up with Inbet, allowing the studio to expand its presence in the coveted Eastern European market, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release shared with the publication.</p>
<p>Among the options that players can enjoy locally are such choices as Joker Bombs, Cubs 2, Chaos Crew, R.I.P. City, Chaos Crew, Stack’em, and many other excellent titles. Hacksaw Gaming is particularly excited to be entering the regional market and bringing its full product suite online there, along with select games to begin with.</p>
<p>This rollout comes at an important time for the company, after it has already succeeded in several important moves in Lithuania and West Virginia over the past several months. Commenting on this new opportunity, Tihomir Daykov, COO at Inbet, said that the brand he represented was one of the fastest-developing brands in the country.</p>
<p>"Our main goal is to continue our great results in the first year of our market entry, and we believe that our partnership with Hacksaw will help us with that," Daykov teased. MarcusCordes, CEO at Hacksaw Gaming was similarly pleased with the developments and he put them in the context of the supplier’s most recent successes.</p>
<p>Cordes welcomed the growing and expanding footprint of iGaming in Europe and globally and said that the supplier was firmly focused on growing its presence in key jurisdictions and markets. In Europe in particular, Hacksaw Gaming has had several prominent successes, with the supplier rolling out with N1 Casino in Greece and GBO in Italy.</p>
<p>The latest Eastern European pivot indicates that Hacksaw Gaming has not really overlooked any jurisdictions and it’s as committed as ever to continue delivering great value for its partners and their audiences across different geographies. From Eastern Europe to North America, Hacksaw Gaming continues to expand and grow its footprint.</p>
