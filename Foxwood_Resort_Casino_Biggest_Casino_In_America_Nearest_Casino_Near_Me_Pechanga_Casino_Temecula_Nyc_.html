<p>A new live casino product will be the result of collaboration between the Greek Betano/Stoiximan and Playtech.</p>
<p>Playtech Teams up with Betano/Stoiximan to Offer Exclusive Live Content</p>
<p>Developer of iGaming products Playtech has recently teamed up with the Greek operator Betano/Stoiximan. Under the partnership, a new exclusive product will be launched on the gaming market deemed as “industry-first“. The new product is a variant of Live Blackjack called “Live Cashback Blackjack”. Started as a random number generator (RNG) game, the new Live Cashback Blackjack features an eight-deck game which is opened to limitless number of players.</p>
<p>The intriguing bit about the game is that players can “cash out” during any action round. Choosing to cash out instead of taking action will award the players with cashback amount determined by the round itself. The new unique game actually adds up to the ever growing portfolio of Playtech Live. The new version is actually the fifth variant of Blackjack predeceased by Unlimited Blackjack, Quantum Blackjack, All bets Blackjack and Majority Rules Speed Blackjack.</p>
<p>But what can players expect from “Live Cashback Blackjack”? At the game start, players wager a main bet and side bets. There is a total of six different side bets. Those are: 21+3, Buster Blackjack, Dealer Pair, Lucky Lucky, Player Pair and Top 3. The action rounds on the other hand hold five choices for the players: Cashback, Hit, Stand, Double or Split. By choosing Split during an action round, the player receives cashback for both hands. If the player chooses Double, no cashback is offered. The cashback rewards are calculated based on the cards which are on the table and may vary depending on each action round. The cashback is only applicable for the main bet, while side bets get paid out separately.</p>
<p>Playtech Live CEO, Edo Haitin commented on the partnership by saying:</p>
<p>The development of Cashback Blackjack Live has been a truly collaborative effort, and takes our partnership with Stoiximan/Betano to a new level. Stoiximan/Betano is already one of the leading operators in the Greek market, and we’re committed to working closely with them to not only build on this position, but also extend that success into further territories.“</p>
<p>Haitin continued by saying that the new product is the result of collaboration of the development teams on both sides. According to him, the new product is dynamic and will give the players much joy and personalized gaming experience. Haitin further noted that the company is excited to see players’ reactions when interacting with a live casino that also offers cashback.</p>
<p>Stoiximan/Betano Live Casino Manager, Christos Mavridis commented by saying: “Product innovation, wide game offer and an optimum customer experience have always been among our priorities at Stoiximan/Betano.” He continued by saying that the customers’ response towards Cashback Blackjack has already been fantastic. Mavridis said that the company is looking forward towards delivering entirely new player experience with the first Live version of the game. He further noted that Playtech actually has quite a record when it comes to innovation and revolutionary approaches for new gaming content. In conclusion, Mavridis said that Playtech was the perfect partner for the developing of the new Cashback Blackjack Live.</p>
