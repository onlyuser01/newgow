<p>In January 2023, the gambling industry in the UK generated over 15.5 million actions cross-platform, with a staggering 29 million people engaging with the content on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram</p>
<p>The data comes from US-based analytics firm Comscore and it has shown that the gambling and lotteries industry in the UK continues to attract a vast audience on social media platforms.</p>
<p>LiveScore Came at the Top of the Comscore Ranking</p>
<p>The UK gambling industryâ€™s popularity has grown significantly over the years, with online betting, casino games, national lotteries, and sports betting attracting many enthusiasts seeking entertainment and excitement.</p>
<p>Comscore, a trusted partner for planning, transacting, and evaluating media across platforms, recently released the ranking of top social properties by engagement for the Gambling &amp; Lotteries category in the UK. The data provides valuable insights for publishers looking to monetize their digital audience better and improve their advertising strategies.</p>
<p>According to the Comscore data, LiveScore ranked as the top social property with over 13 million actions and an audience of 4.2 million followers. Paddy Power came in second with 1.1 million actions, while PokerStars had 185,528 actions. Other companies such as bet365, Sky Bet, William Hill, and Dream Team also ranked in the top 10.</p>
<p>The Comscore data goes to show that the gambling and lotteries industry in the UK shows no signs of slowing down, and social media platforms continue to play a vital role in engaging the audience.</p>
<p>The Huge Popularity of Online Gambling in the UK Has Its Implications</p>
<p>The rise of online gaming within the UK can be attributed to the implementation of the Gambling Act of 2005, which allowed gambling companies to freely promote various forms of betting, including online casinos, sports betting, and poker through various media platforms.</p>
<p>It was not until 2014 that offshore companies selling to British customers were mandated to obtain a valid UK license to operate. As a result of this, the online gaming industry within the UK has seen tremendous growth.</p>
<p>The huge popularity of online gaming, however, also has a dark side. Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the amount of money that British individuals have lost to online gambling.</p>
<p>A report by the House of Lords has revealed that the gambling industry generates 60% of its profits from just 5% of its customers. Regulators have classified 138,000 individuals in England as problem gamblers, with the number of children aged 11-16 being at 36,000.</p>
<p>Government statistics have shown that gambling is responsible for approximately 8% of all suicides in the UK, with an estimated 400 individuals taking their own lives each year due to gambling-related issues. The impact of gambling can also be felt through broken marriages, bankruptcy, homelessness, and crime.</p>
