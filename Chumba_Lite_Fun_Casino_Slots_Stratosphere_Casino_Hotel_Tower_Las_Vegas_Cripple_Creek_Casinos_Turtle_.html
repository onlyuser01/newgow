<p>XB Net, a supplier of racing content, has negotiated a new distribution rights deal with Betindiaraces to provide the latter with coverage from North American and Australian horse racing markets. The new partnership will help both companies expand their business footprint, and giveBetindiaraces the upper hand as the company seeks to deliver on the best possible content.</p>
<p>Powered by Sportswin Software, Betindiaraces is hoping to achieve a distinct status and provide consumers in India with a quality racing and betting experience that will help it elevate its visibility in the highly-competitive market. Commenting on the new opportunity for both companies, XB Net SVP of International Simon Fraser said that the firm’s content will garner new significance in the context of this fresh alliance.</p>
<p>XB Net is committed to growing its footprint across the world, with India presenting a unique opportunity. According to Fraser, the Indian market has long been an underserved niche with fans and consumers often hard-pressed to find worthwhile content and opportunities.</p>
<p>Fraser said that this was happening at a time when the global horse racing industry was making a recovery and that enabled companies to expand content reach further and introduce the sport to new fans. Betindiaraces stands to benefit distinctly because of this new partnership which will bring some of the best Australian and North American horse racing events, Fraser assured.</p>
<p>The partnership was licensed by Royal Calcutta Turf Club and Betindiaraces users may expect to see new wagering opportunitiesmaterialize. These new markets will drive engagement and interest from existing and would-be customers who will be more inclined to join now that XB Net’s content guarantees variety and innovation.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Sportswin Software Co-Founder Sharath Narayana said that both the Australian and North American markets feature some of the most prominent horse racing opportunities. The fact that they can now be packed and delivered to Indian audiences was a significant step into the future of horse racing.</p>
<p>Narayana added that the new content will make a perfect fit into the existing platform and that India’s domestic market was ripe for a change that features more events from around the world. Australia and North America bring some of the most prominent fixtures in the horse racing calendar, regardless of your affinity for the sport.</p>
<p>The Triple Crown Events featuring the Belmont Stakes, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby are some of the most anticipated racing opportunities and so is the Melbourne Cup in Australia. Another fixture that will now be made available to audiences in India thanks to XB Net and Betindiaraces.</p>
