    <h1>Casino Guitar Hard Rock Casino Locations Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Hilton Ponce Golf Casino Reso</h1>

<p>Since you refuse to pass verification, in this case I will be forced to write a statement to law enforcement agencies on the fact of FRAUD art. 190. of the Criminal Code of the Betting Company, is engaged in deception. Your deception lies in the fact that, in case of winning, your site prevents the withdrawal of funds. On my part, there were no violations of the rules and conditions on your web resource, I uploaded all the necessary documents for the withdrawal. Your Bet1000 bookmaker refuses me to pass verification, referring to the fact that you did not like the photo in the document, you wrote that the passport is expired. Your organization is doing all the things that FRAUDERS usually do!! In addition, you require additional documents, for what? And for what purpose I do not understand, all my previously uploaded documents have a wet seal and each document is 100% valid</p>
<p>In principle, there is nothing to be surprised at here! Any organization that earns by deception, FRAUD will always and constantly look for any excuses to get hold of other people's money by deception.</p>
<p>Consequences, for your site in</p>
<p>in case of refusal to return the winnings !!</p>
<p>Since I have suspicions that your web resource is BC. Bet1000, under the guise of a gambling business, is engaged in fraud, to one degree or another. Since gambling business is allowed in Ukraine by the jurisdiction of my country, at the state level, I will write a statement to the law enforcement agencies, the evidence is enough to consider your web resource as a bookmaker. Bet1000 is a Cheat and FRAUD organization! After I write an application to Mono Bank, an application will be sent where your web resource address will be indicated to the employee of this financial institution, and specifically what is BC. Bet1000 site is a FRAUD, just a reminder that I have charges on your site. In general, after all the evidence collected, I think after the court order, your organization is the BC website. Bet1000 will be blocked, by the Cyber Police, in the Internet space on the territory of Ukraine.</p>
<p>I also want to remind you that your organization, under the guise of activity of Bookmakers, collects personal data of citizens of Ukraine, supposedly for the purpose of passing verification, in fact, you take possession of the documents but at the same time do not allow users of your wab resource to pass verification for withdrawal of funds , coming up with all sorts of versions that are not justified by anything on your part.</p>
<p>Now I also want to inform you that if I do not receive my withdrawal of funds, the amount of UAH 8,000, I will be forced to contact the regulator that issued you a license to operate the Betting Office! I will provide all the facts of the factor that you are violating the Terms and Conditions of the regulator that issued the license to you. I always and everywhere pass KYC without any problems, your organization does not allow me to pass only in the fact that your website is engaged in FRAUD activity, which does not correspond to those Betting companies where I also spend time making bets.</p>
<p>If, however, you do not consider yourself a FRAUD ORGANIZATION, give an answer, what document would you like to see? What else do you need to verify my account.</p>
<p>Besite!!!! I am an honest player, and I do not violate the rules and conditions anywhere, while I always and everywhere go through this procedure, you are the first who write me such statements that you didnâ€™t like something in the passport on the first page.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous! I was 17 when I got my passport! The date of receipt of the passport is indicated on the second page. At the very bottom, the date of receipt: 04/01/2008. and you want me to look like the first photo there?? But for this, a second photograph is taken at the age of 25, which is there !!! If it were not there, the passport would not be valid!! In my case, there is a second photo. And besides, in the screenshot from the banking of my card, the passport data converge completely, if the passport were not valid, then in this case I would not be able to pass verification at the bank institution. But all the data of the questionnaire converge.</p>
<p>In general, I still have those passports, which indicate that I am the owner of the vehicle, the car was purchased in 2020, this information is indicated there. It indicates exactly when the vehicle (car) was registered to me, the document contains all the information where and on what date the re-registration was.</p>
<p>Bet1000 Will this document suit you?? It seems to me that I have already downloaded and owned everything that can verify my account on your platform</p>
