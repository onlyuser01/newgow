<p>The new company will focus on operations in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Canada and other regulated markets</p>
<p>Whitezip, a renowned online marketing and software development agency, has announced a merger with Markor Technology, an acclaimed provider of PAM and aggregation services. The notable deal will see the two companies pair their capabilities to deliver even better gaming experiences.</p>
<p>The newly-formed entity will be called Casimba Gaming. Founded upon Markor and Whitezip’s robust expertise, Casimba Gaming is poised for success. As a result, the new organization is bullish on quickly establishing a global footprint, showcasing a best-in-class portfolio of iGaming products and solutions and demonstrating its experience in navigating complex regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new entity’s consolidated revenues will exceed £100 million ($124 million), while the profit margin is expected to remain strong. With a team of 160 experienced workers and 50,000+ monthly customers, Casimba is certain to capitalize on Markor and Whitezip’s expertise.</p>
<p>The new company will focus on operations in regulated markets, with the United Kingdom, the Nordics and Canada being jurisdictions of top priority. It will be headed by Dersim Sylwan, Whitezip’s chief executive officer.</p>
<p>CEO Sylwan Praised the Merger</p>
<p>Dersim Sylwan, the appointed CEO of Casimba Gaming, commented on the merger between Markor Technology and Whitezip. According to him, the deal makes perfect sense, since it will pair the two companies’ experiences, resulting in superior casino products and experiences.</p>
<p>Combining the marketing, data, design and development expertise from Whitezip with the technology and operational expertise from Markor Technology will allow us to give both our customers and partners a great experience and portfolio of products. Dersim Sylwan, CEO, Casimba Gaming</p>
<p>Whitezip was originally founded in 2016. The company, which specializes in player acquisition and retention, now serves 15 casino brands, including Dream Vegas, Barz, Lumicasino and Reload, among others. Whitezip currently boasts offices in London and Malta and has an impressive track record of helping its partners grow.</p>
<p>Markor Technology, meanwhile, is a fairly fresh entity that was only founded in 2020. The company provides a comprehensive multi-vertical PAM and white label system and an expanding gaming aggregation platform.</p>
<p>In February, Markor onboarded gaming content from Galaxsys, a supplier and developer of innovative and cutting-edge iGaming content. A few days earlier, the tech company also enhanced its live casino portfolio with games developed by Skywind, an acclaimed supplier of gaming technology and content.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2023, Markor secured a license in Ontario, further expanding its reach and, by extension, the reach of Casimba Gaming.</p>
