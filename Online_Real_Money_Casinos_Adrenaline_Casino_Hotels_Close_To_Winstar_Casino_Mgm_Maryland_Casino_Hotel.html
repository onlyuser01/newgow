<p>The 2020 Memorial Tournament is the latest golf event on the PGA Tour featuring some of the best golfers. DeChambeau is in the lead with (+1000) and Tiger Woods is returning for the first time since his last appearance in The Match: Champions For Charity.</p>
<p>2020 Memorial Tournament Overview</p>
<p>The 2020 Memorial Tournament is exciting for at least several reasons. First, it reunites a top crop of golfers, not least Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa who battled tooth-and-nail during last weekend’s Workday Charity Open on Sunday.</p>
<p>Yet, the event is bigger for another reason, seeing five-time champion Tiger Woods returning to the PGA Tour, his first competitive appearance since the Genesis Invitational in February.</p>
<p>Last year, the event’s title went to Patrick Cantlay who managed to secure a second victory at Muirfield Village, which is also hosting this year’s edition on Thursday, July 16. Cantlay is back as an underdog in the most recent selection and still ahead of Tiger Woods who is priced at (+2800).</p>

<p>Tiger Woods Returns as Heavy Underdog</p>
<p>Clearly, Tiger Woods will be one of the main attractions at the Memorial Golf for many people. Woods is returning after a four-month hiatus. He last competed in the Genesis Invitational in February, but ruled against further participations due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>His return is a cornerstone event and will definitely raise expectations from Woods, who has made no particular claim on the title and has had a rather modest performance overall. His most recent entry in 2019 saw him finish T-9.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to playing in the @MemorialGolf next week. I’ve missed going out and competing with the guys and can’t wait to get back out there. — Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) July 9, 2020</p>
<p>Woods did appear in The Match: Champions For Charity in May, but that event was purely for the sake of raising funds to tackle the raging pandemic, rather than a true competitive leg of the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>He is also facing a rather heavy field of competitors this time around with Justin Thomas, Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy all sending a rather strong message that they want a win at Muirfield Village.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods’ Showing in Past Events</p>
<p>Woods has been at Muirfield Village four times in the past seven years, showing somewhat middling results. In fact, he hasn’t managed to break in Top 10 in three of his last four showings, and generally seems to perform poorly at the event. Still, bookies price him directly at (+2500) neck-and-neck with Hideki Matsuyama and Viktor Hovland.</p>

<p>Colin Morikawa: Another Promising Golfer to Watch Out For</p>
<p>Morikawa seems to be in a good starting position. He’s priced at (+2200) and did tackle Justin Thomas in his last golf bout on Sunday. He was even tipped as a strong underdog. His showing at Muirfield Village has been consistent, and this could result in another odds-defying performance this week, landing the first spot.</p>
<p>If Morikawa plays right and he makes it to a first-place finish, a simple $10 bet on him would fetch $200, a solid return. Of course, there is a reason why Morikawa is still considered to be one of the best golfers in the event.</p>
<p>He has delivered two back-to-back excellent performances, first winning the Workday Charity Open and, before that, landing 2nd in the Charles Schwab Challenge.</p>
<p>Both events put him firmly on the map even if his overall results at this course aren’t necessarily his best. We still believe Morikawa is a very smart bet here.</p>
<p>Beyond the Reasonable Picks</p>
<p>Of course, there are other golfers who have shown talent and promise, but who are priced farther down the odds, mostly due to inconsistent playstyles and results. There are some names that stand out a modicum of scrutiny, and not least Daniel Berger (+4000), Abraham Ancer (+5000) and Sergio Garcia (+6600).</p>
<p>Ancer has managed to finish T-14 at the Charles Schwa Challenge and T-11 at the Travelers Championship, two of his best achievements so far. Yet, it’s a huge leap from there to seeing him win the Memorial Tournament.</p>
<p>Berger has slightly better chances. He has been mostly dormant since his victory at the Charles Schwab Challenge. Yet, we would like to think that his slumber has come to an end and he is preparing to wake up with a bang.</p>
<p>Last but not least, you have Sergio Garcia who has had middling performance, but good overall strokes (1.63) per round over 16 career rounds at Muirfield Village.</p>
<p>Overall, we have a good thing coming up during the 2020 Memorial Tournament with some very clear favorites and some promising underdogs.</p>
