    <h1>Fortune Casino Online Maverick Casino Elko The Palmetto Casino Crocs Resort And Casino Oklahoma Casi</h1>

<p>The leading provider of innovative iGaming content that has produced over 1,000 exclusive titles and an iconic, record-breaking network of progressive jackpots, Games Global, has fresh and exciting news.</p>
<p>The supplier with a massive distribution channel that currently services more than 900 worldwide gaming brands has launched the King Millions jackpot, once again proving its supremacy in the progressive jackpot landscape.</p>
<p>The GRAND Jackpot Can Trigger €30M+ in Cash Prizes</p>
<p>The new jackpot is the supplier’s biggest network jackpot so far and it allows players to double the chance to win massive prizes with two different jackpots capped at €1 ($1.1 million) and €2 million ($2.2 million) respectively.</p>
<p>The GRAND Jackpot is capable of triggering over €30 million in prizes, breaking yet another record in the industry. The fresh network jackpot can drop at any moment during the base game.</p>
<p>A bonus wheel with win multipliers ranging between 7x and 100x the bet can also pop up, along with the MAJOR and GRAND jackpot variants.</p>
<p>The “Highly Customizable” King Jackpot to Meet All Customer Needs</p>
<p>The King Jackpot can be easily adapted to meet customer needs, enabling operators to differentiate their offerings.</p>
<p>Since it will be intertwined with the iconic 9 Masks of Fire slot and other equally popular titles, the progressive jackpot is expected to turn into “a huge hit with operators and players alike,” according to the company’s chief product officer, Andrew Booth.</p>
<p>Booth further explained the new product is an excellent addition to Games Global’s current library, further showing the provider’s increased focus on creating market-leading jackpot games with highly-popular series like Mega Moolah and WowPot! on top of the list.</p>
<p>The CPO also took the opportunity to express excitement for the company’s ability to constantly push the boundaries with special emphasis on their jackpot products while acknowledging their “strong reputation” as a leading supplier in the jackpot field.</p>
<p>The jackpot created by the supplier that delivers force and direction to the iGaming universe has been created “specifically to raise the bar on progressive jackpot slots” with a top prize pool over the €30 million ($33 million) mark before a drop and eight-figure amounts that have never been seen before on the market.</p>
<p>As explained by Games Global’s chief executive officer, Walter Bugno, the company “has embarked on a journey to become the one” name that suppliers, employers, and partners will have in mind when thinking about the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Last May, Games Global purchased Microgaming’s distribution business and online games portfolio. In December 2022, the supplier inked a partnership with OROS Gaming, a fresh studio and developer.</p>
