<p>Push Gaming, a company acclaimed for many distinct titles in the iGaming market, has boosted its reach further, teaming up with both Betsson and Novibet in Greece, in a move designed to significantly expand the supplier’s presence on the local market.</p>
<p>Both companies will have the opportunity to benefit from well-established products that are known to customers, with the likes of Jammin’ Jars, Retro Tapes, and Wild Swarm all available at the two brand’s websites. Push Gaming has been determined to grow in the region, and the latest move shows that this commitment has not lessened.</p>
<p>Push Gaming Director of New Business and Markets Fiona Hickey welcomed the opportunity and said that the two partnerships were a pivotal moment for it in Greece. Novibet and Betsson are some of the biggest names on the market and they will help Push Gaming gain immediate name recognition.</p>
<p>"We’ve got an incredibly exciting portfolio of games with so much more quality on the horizon and we’re thoroughly looking forward to providing both with more of the best games in the industry," Hickey concluded.</p>
<p>Push Gaming has had many successful partnerships over the past weeks and months, with the company securing one with MaxBet.ro in Romania and Grand Casino Luzern in Switzerland. Push Gaming has also expanded its presence with Fair Play Casino in the Netherlands, as the supplier continues to build its European footprint.</p>
<p>The company has focused on developing fully optimised HTML5 games that allow it to integrate its content offering quickly and seamlessly with new and existing partners, delivering a seamless experience for players as well.</p>
<p>Push Gaming is not going to stop in Greece, as the supplier is already preparing more announcements to arrive over the weeks and months ahead.</p>
