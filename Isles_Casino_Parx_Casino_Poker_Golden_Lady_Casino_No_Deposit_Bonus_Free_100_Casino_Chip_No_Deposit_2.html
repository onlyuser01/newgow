<p>Harrah’s Atlantic City will reopen its poker room for visitors on December 26. Although the pandemic is yet to pass, the operator has implemented strict health and safety protocols ensuring the well-being of guests and employees.</p>
<p>The Poker Room at Harrah’s in Atlantic City Reopens on December 26</p>
<p>More live casino entertainment will become available for Atlantic City poker fans before the end of the year. According to the Press of Atlantic City, Harrah’s Atlantic City poker room, which is branded by World Series of Poker, will reopen for visitors just after Christmas on December 26.</p>
<p>In total, there are 5 poker rooms within casinos in Atlantic City: the poker tables at the Borgata, Bally’s, Harrah’s, Golden Nugget, and Tropicana. Considering that the poker room at the Borgata has already reopened on October 21, this makes Harrah’s WSOP-branded poker room the second to return to play in the city. Although Caesars Entertainment revealed that it will reopen the poker room at Harrah’s, for the moment it is unknown when the one in Tropicana will reopen for visitors.</p>
<p>Health and Safety Remains a Top Priority at Harrah’s</p>
<p>The senior vice president and general manager of Harrah’s Atlantic City, Ron Baumann said that the resort is “thrilled” to re-open the “World Series of Poker room just in time for the new year”.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he stressed that for several months Caesars has been enhancing their health and safety measures aiming at comfortable and safe conditions for both team members and guests. In conclusion, Baumann said that the result of the increased health and safety measures is the return of table games to the gaming market.</p>
<p>Similar to the casino floors and other areas within the resort, wearing of masks by guests is mandatory. Furthermore, Harrah’s Atlantic City follows strictly the executive orders issued by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy for safe operations during the pandemic. With that in mind, the working hours of the poker room will be from 12 P.M. until 4 A.M. Moreover, to ensure employee and guest safety, the operator will also limit the table seats to 8 and install plexiglass spacers.</p>
