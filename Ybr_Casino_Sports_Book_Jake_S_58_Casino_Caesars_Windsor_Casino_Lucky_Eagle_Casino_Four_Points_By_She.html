<p>Videoslots, a company focusing on gaming and betting solutions, has become the latest member of the International Betting Integrity Association through its dedicated sportsbook platform. As a result, Videoslots Sports will participate in IBIA’s efforts to uphold, regulate and protect sports globally.</p>
<p>IBIA Welcomes Videoslots in Ranks</p>
<p>Videoslots is just the latest sportsbook to vow its support for the ambitious task that IBIA has put for itself in eradicating fraud from all levels of competition. Sports betting operators that are part of the association have reported a global turnover of over $137 billion, and with the Qatar World Cup 2022 on the cards, commercial and online betting revenue is bound to keep growing.</p>
<p>What is more, Videoslots will make a fine addition to tackling corruption as it operates in numerous high-profile markets, including Sweden, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Malta, and the United Kingdom. Surprisingly, Europe leads the way when it comes to suspicious betting signals that Videoslots will now submit to the body for further review and investigation.</p>
<p>Videoslots head of sports Martin Calleja welcomed the opportunity and said that this was an important part of the company’s long-term strategy. Calleja explained:</p>
<p>The association’s network and representation of regulated betting operators provides the perfect partner to bolster our business protection protocols and to identify and punish betting-related corruption. Videoslots head of sports Martin Calleja</p>
<p>The membership was equally welcomed by IBIA CEO Khalid Ali who said that Videoslots’ participation will make a sizable impact in helping the organization monitor and follow up on suspicious betting signals. Ali confirmed that the pair will work closely together to ensure that customers stay protected from fraudulent betting activity.</p>
<p>Corruption in Sports Can Be Tackled</p>
<p>IBIA has been one of the staunchest proponents of making sure that sports are free from manipulation. The organization’s efforts have included collaborating with sports bodies as well as athletes and educating people in the sports industry about the dangers of sports betting corruption and other event manipulations.</p>
<p>IBIA prides itself on building a highly-efficient tool that enables it to clamp down on corruption quickly and efficiently in sports. The organization works with a number of high-profile international bodies in and outside sports, including the Council of Europe, the European Commission, the Insertional Olympic Committee, and the United Nations. Previously, IBIA added VBET and the company continues to actively establish new partnerships.</p>
