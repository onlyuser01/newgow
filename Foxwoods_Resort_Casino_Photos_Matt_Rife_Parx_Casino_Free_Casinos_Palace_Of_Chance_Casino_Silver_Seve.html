<p>Dunder Casino allows individuals with gambling issues to play, thus breaking the responsible gaming rules of their MGA license. In 2022, I requested a block on all possible gaming sites through PÃ¤ihdelinkki; this included sister casinos, future sibling casinos, and a permanent gambling ban, due to my gambling problem. This request was forwarded to their sister company, Kazoom Casino, and my account there was closed. However, in February 2023, Dunder allowed me to register with them and make constant deposits. They also verified my account using documents which should have, at the very latest, alerted them to my issue and cease my gaming; instead, they allowed me to continue. I requested a gaming ban via a different email, but with exactly the same personal details, including my full name, address, date of birth - only the email address differed. Other responsible casinos have been able to identify me in the same way, so I believe a different email address alone should not prevent players from being blocked, as all my other details remained the same. I asked them to refund my deposits to Dunder Casino and they are uncooperative. A responsible casino would reimburse the money and admit the mistake, but they do not because they want to unlawfully profit from people with gambling problems. As an MGA license holder, there are strict rules regarding responsible gaming and the need to identify customers. This casino is not taking responsibility and I urge everyone who has been treated in this way by them or their sister companies to issue complaints and investigations with the MGA. Fight against these irresponsible casinos and stand your ground. Gambling addiction is a disease that many casinos take advantage of. I, too, will ask the MGA to investigate this matter concerning Dunder Casino if nothing is done.</p>
