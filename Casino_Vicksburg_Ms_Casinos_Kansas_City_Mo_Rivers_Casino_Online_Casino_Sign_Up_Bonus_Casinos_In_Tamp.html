<p>Just before the end of 2022, on December 31, the leading gaming operator, Wynn Macau, announced its plans to pay special allowance for nearly its entire workforce</p>
<p>A statement released by the company reveals that the special allowance will be paid to 98% of its current workforce which is 11,600 employees.</p>
<p>Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau Employees to Receive Special Allowance on January 16</p>
<p>Wynn Macau explained that the special allowance will be “equivalent to one month’s gross salary.” The payment itself is expected to be completed on January 16, 2023. According to the company, 98% of its eligible members that are part of Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau will be receiving the special allowance.</p>
<p>“Following the recent award of gaming licenses and the removal of pandemic travel restrictions, we are optimistic about our prospects in 2023.“ Linda Chen, vice-chairman of Wynn Macau</p>
<p>Linda Chen, Wynn Macau’s vice-chairman, acknowledged that the company was recently awarded gaming licenses in the country. Moreover, she explained that the lifting of COVID-related travel restrictions makes Wynn Macau feel optimistic about 2023. Chen added that Wynn Macau plans to attract new guests by bringing in new non-gaming attractions. At the same time, she pointed out that the company’s workforce will play an important part in the process.</p>
<p>“We will commence significant efforts to implement non-gaming attractions and introduce visitors from new markets,“ added Chen</p>
<p>The company pointed out that its employees have shown an “exceptional level of loyalty, commitment and discipline.” Moreover, Wynn Macau pointed out that offering unique experiences while at the same time ensuring the safety and health of its guests and colleagues was a prime objective, especially during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Company Completed Senior-Level Changes</p>
<p>The news about the special allowance coincided with another announcement by Wynn Macau. On Friday, the company revealed it named Ellen Whittemore as a non-executive director. A filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange pointed out that Whittemore’s appointment is effective from January 1, 2023, and that Matthew Maddox stepped down from the position of non-executive director of Wynn Macau as of December 31, 2022.</p>
<p>But Wynn Macau isn’t the only company that announced a special allowance. Industry giant Sands China recently revealed its plans to hand out discretionary allowance to 99% of its employees. The extra salary is expected to affect some 23,000 eligible full-time members of the company and the payment itself is planned for January 18, 2023.</p>
