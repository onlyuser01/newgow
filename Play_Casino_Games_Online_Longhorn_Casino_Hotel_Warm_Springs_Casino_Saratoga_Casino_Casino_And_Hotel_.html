<p>The leading sports betting and iGaming company, BetMGM, announced the launch of multiple new games branded after the National Hockey League (NHL).</p>
<p>BetMGM Reveals NHL-Branded Games</p>
<p>The company revealed on Thursday that it launched NHL-branded content that included blackjack, baccarat and roulette games. Additionally, BetMGM introduced its newest live Money Wheel Game –Dream Catcher. The operator said that all of those games are currently available to key markets in the United States including New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and even Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The new game titles offer players an immersive gaming experience by combining high-quality animations and 3D renderings. What’s more, each of the games has a unique “go live” functionality that allows the players to tap into the live dealer version of the game right away. BetMGM’s new content was developed in partnership with the leading B2B solutions provider for casino operators, Evolution. It’s no surprise that the games feature NHL’s logo but also display logos from different hockey teams.</p>
<p>According to BetMGM, NHL Blackjack places the players “at a table inside an arena skybox with the ability to move virtually between seats.” On the other hand, NHL Roulette offers in-depth results and statistics for the game combined with realistic ball movement, while NHL Baccarat offers a casino-like experience complemented by similar innovative options. BetMGM’s newest title, Dream Catcher, allows the players to select a number at which they think the wheel will stop. Further boosting the experience, the new game title offers different multipliers.</p>
<p>The New Content Strengthens the BetMGM’s Partnership with NHL</p>
<p>Jason Jazayeri, NHL’s VP of business development, revealed that it is exciting to see the League’s collaboration with BetMGM expand. According to him, the new NHL-branded casino games will boost NHL’s engagement with its fans. In conclusion, Jazayeri said: “We look forward to collaborating with BetMGM on other fan-centric efforts in years to come.”</p>
<p>“We’re excited to broaden our relationship with BetMGM through the development of NHL-branded casino games, particularly when these new platforms allow us to deepen the connection NHL fans have to our sport in a more immersive and compelling way.“ Jason Jazayeri, VP, business development at NHL</p>
<p>Oliver Bartlett, BetMGM’s director of gaming, added that the NHL-branded games help strengthen the company’s relationship with the League. Last but not least, Bartlett acknowledged that it is thrilling to offer exciting new content for players and sports fans just in time for the start of the new NHL season.</p>
