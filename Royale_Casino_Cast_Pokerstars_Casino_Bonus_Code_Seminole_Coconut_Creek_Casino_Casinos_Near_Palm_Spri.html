    <h1>Royale Casino Cast Pokerstars Casino Bonus Code Seminole Coconut Creek Casino Casinos Near Palm Spri</h1>

<p>With Connecticut launching online casinos and sports betting last Tuesday, the first trickles of big data are already in. GeoComply, the company that helps operators in the US provide their services to players based in the same state, has offered a quick summation of the numbers in the first week of betting in the Constitution State.</p>
<p>The data firm cited a big interest in the regulated gambling market with many New Yorkers heading across the state line to place a remote wager. Connecticut is actively offering New Yorkers an alternative to the trip down south to New Jersey, as they now can place wagers in both states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New York is planning to roll out its sports betting in early 2022 and that means that New Jersey and Connecticut have a small window of opportunity to cash in on the additional traffic. Neither state is going to suffer significantly from the fact.</p>
<p>New Yorkers Fuel Connecticut’s Online Betting and Gaming</p>
<p>Connecticut has a population of over 3.5 million people and it’s already ranked 9th in terms of overall online casino and sports betting traffic, GeoComply noted in a post on Sunday, meaning that the state is already ahead of other jurisdictions that have large populations. The example used in the official release is Colorado with a population of 5.7 million.</p>
<p>GeoComply dug a little deeper into analyzing not only Connecticut sports bettors’ behavior but also consumer trends among New Yorkers. GeoComply VP of global government relations Chad Kornett said that the fact that residents of New York would travel to neighboring states indicated a change in consumer trends where people are more willing to put an additional effort to ensure that they bet at places that provide them with proper consumer protection measures. Kornett added:</p>
<p>“Connecticut looks to be quickly following a similar pattern: Easily accessed from the New York City area, GeoComply’s data shows 38% of Connecticut’s wagering activity has originated from the southwestern corner of the state along the I-95 corridor.” GeoComply VP of global government relations Chad Kornett</p>
<p>Naturally, GeoComply is aware that once New York has sports betting of its own this would impact Connecticut’s betting landscape as well. The company has not provided data or forecasts as to how many bettors the state may lose. In the meantime, GeoComply has noticed a significant upward trend in regulated gambling markets in the first four weeks of NFL.</p>
