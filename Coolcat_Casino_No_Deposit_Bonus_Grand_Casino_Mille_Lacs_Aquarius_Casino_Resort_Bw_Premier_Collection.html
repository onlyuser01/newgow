<p>Chidi Njokuani vs. Albert Duraev is one of the most interesting matchups on the fight card of UFC on ESPN 43, an event taking place this coming Saturday at AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio</p>
<p>Njokuani vs. Duraev is a striker vs. wrestler fight. Chidi Bang Bang has a KO/TKO rate of 63.63%, while submissions make up 60% of Machete’s career wins. The big question is which style of fighting will prevail on Saturday. That’s the question we’ll try to answer now.</p>
<p>Chidi Njokuani vs. Albert Duraev Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Chidi Njokuani -194 Albert Duraev +150 *Odds taken from FanDuel on Tuesday, March 21, 2023.</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio, Texas</p>
<p>: AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio, Texas Date : Saturday, March 25, 2023</p>
<p>: Saturday, March 25, 2023 Time : ~10:00 PM ET</p>
<p>: ~10:00 PM ET How to Watch: ESPN</p>
<p>Chidi Njokuani is a KO Expert</p>
<p>Chidi Bang Bang is 22-8-1 overall, with 14 of his wins happening by KO/TKO, including each of his two wins in the UFC. Before signing for this promotion, Njokuani impressed in Dana White’s Contender series in 2021, and before that, he fought eight bouts in Bellator.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this guy is used to chasing opponents around in a large cage such as the one used by Bellator. The fact that he’s now fighting in the UFC’s Octagon, which is smaller, means that he’s got an easier job in finding the target with his punches and kicks.</p>
<p>The bad news is that his opponents can strike back as well, which is what happened in his most recent fight in which Gregory Rodrigues beat him by TKO. Can Albert Duraev do the same? Very unlikely. It’s not just because the Russian isn’t a great striker; it’s also because he prefers to try and take the fight to the ground.</p>
<p>Albert Duraev to Try and Take Chidi Down</p>
<p>Machete is 15-4 in his professional career, with all four of his losses happening by KO/TKO. This means that he’s got a weak chin, something which needs to concern him ahead of the fight with Njokuani.</p>
<p>Duraev cannot outbox him. Nor can he withstand getting punched by Njokuani constantly throughout the three five-minute rounds. The thing is that the American fighter lands 4.28 significant strikes per minute. If Njokuani lands as many on Saturday, it will mean that Duraev is going to absorb over 60 strikes, something he’s never experienced so far.</p>
<p>That said, his only viable tactic is to try and take the fight to the ground. He’s an excellent wrestler who knows how to finish his opponents on the floor. The evidence of this is that nine of his 15 wins happened by submission. The question, however, is whether he’ll be able to take Njokuani down.</p>
<p>Chidi Njokuani vs. Albert Duraev Prediction</p>
<p>We’re almost 100% certain Chidi Njokuani will win this fight. The only uncertainty is the method of victory. Njokuani has the power to destroy Duraev with his strikes, possibly winning by a KO/TKO. However, we might see him take a more cautious approach and go for a win by decision. In that case, we’ll see him land even more strikes than usual.</p>
<p>Pick: Chidi Njokuani to win</p>
