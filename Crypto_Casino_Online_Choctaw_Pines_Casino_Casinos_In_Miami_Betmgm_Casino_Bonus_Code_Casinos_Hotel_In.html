<p>Technology and content provider for the gaming industry Inspired Entertainment, Inc. announced it entered into a new long-term contract with gaming group Entain plc to roll out its portfolio of Virtual Sports content across all of Entain’s retail shops and venues and online brands.</p>
<p>“Inspired and Entain have been collaborating closely for the past decade through a successful partnership in both the retail and online channels.” Brooks Pierce, President and COO, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Deal Expands Existing Partnership</p>
<p>The new agreement extended both in scope and duration to the ongoing deal Inspired has with the gaming group, which operates in both retail and online sports betting and iGaming in multiple countries around the world where markets are regulated as of November, when GVC Holding rebranded into Entain, the group also announced its withdrawal from all unregulated jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“This new agreement is testament to the strength of our offerings and we look forward to extending our long-standing relationship and opening it up to new territories for Inspired, including North America, with Entain’s recognized brands.” Brooks Pierce, President and COO, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Home to some of the most popular online gaming brands such as Ladbrokes, Coral, bwin, Sportingbet, Eurobet, BetMGM, partypoker and partycasino, Gala and Foxy Bingo, Entain offers iGaming across all verticals, supported by its proprietary technology platform.</p>
<p>“Inspired has been a trusted key supplier and their Virtuals have proven to be very popular with our customers in both our retail venues and via our interactive platforms.” Sandeep Tiku, COO, Entain</p>
<p>Virtual Sports Popular among Players</p>
<p>The Virtual Sports portfolio of games offered by Inspired is popular among players worldwide, offered through more than 40,000 retail and more than 100 digital channels across 35 countries, including Greece which launched in October 2020 V-Play Basketball, alongside V-Play Soccer 3.0 and Matchday across the entire retail estate of state-run operator OPAP.</p>
<p>“We have been impressed with their continued innovation in Virtuals and we are excited that even more of our customers will be able to enjoy Inspired’s best-in-class content for the first time.” Sandeep Tiku, COO, Entain</p>
<p>Entain’s deal with Inspired followed in the footsteps of US leader in daily fantasy sports (DFS) and sports betting DraftKings, which signed a deal with the technology and content provider in April 2020 to acquire access to its V-Play portfolio of 14 virtual sport games.</p>
<p>On a side note, Entain is still trying to complete the proposed acquisition of Baltic operator Enlabs AB, where large minority shareholders seemed to have joined efforts and block the offer from the gaming group.</p>
