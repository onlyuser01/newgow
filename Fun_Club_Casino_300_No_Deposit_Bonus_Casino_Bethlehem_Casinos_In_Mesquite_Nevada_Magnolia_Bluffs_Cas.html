<p>The ComeOn Group has revealed that it is receiving two branded games that are designed for its Swedish iGaming casinos, Snabbare and Hajper. The games will be deployed by 1×2 Network, with Tomb of Snabbare and Tomb of Hajper leading to more memorable and player-focused experiences that are expected to drive engagement and enhance the existing gameplay at both online brands.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group Gets Branded Slots for Swedish Gaming Brands</p>
<p>Both games have been tailored-made and tweaked to best match ComeOn Group player expectations and preferences. The titles are also built on a proven formula introduced in Book of Ba’al which was developed by a 1×2 subsidiary, Iron Dog Studio. The visuals though will focus exclusively on recreating the brands and incorporating their distinct signature style in the core gameplay of each respective title.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group has already launched the games in September but has just made an official statement. Similar to the game they are based on, the games feature 5×3-reel and 10-payline winning combinations. There are book symbols that will allow players to collect the bonus games and a native mechanic which is centered around the “book of features” developed in the original slot.</p>
<p>1×2 Network has spent a considerable effort on its “Tomb of” and “Book of” mechanics and development efforts, all of which are dedicated to creating bespoke experiences that appeal to specific gaming audiences and the brands that they are playing at most frequently. Highly customizable content is becoming the bread-and-butter of 1×2 Network which is committed to building more compelling products that are tailored to each individual brand.</p>
<p>1×2 Network Ivalina Petrova welcomed this opportunity and explained why this was an important development for the company and a watershed for the industry as a whole, alluding to previous successes such as Branded Megaways games.</p>
<p>Following on from the runaway success of Branded Megaways, more and more operators are exploring the idea of bespoke, branded game content. ‘Tomb of Snabbare’ and ‘Tomb of Hajper’ are two fantastic games for two of the biggest casino brands in Sweden. We hope we get the opportunity to create more games for ComeOn brands and other tier one operators. 1×2 Network Ivalina Petrova</p>
<p>Bespoke Solutions Will Lead the Way in iGaming</p>
<p>ComeOn Group Jason Bradbury welcomed the opportunity and said that the company was excited to see these two bespoke games join its content offering. The company and brands have big expectations from Tomb of Snabbare and Tomb of Hajper, Bradbury assured.</p>
<p>According to Bradbury, the games can be very valuable in terms of acquisition and retention. How successful, though, remains to be seen. Data though will drive further bespoke releases, Bradbury hinted.</p>
