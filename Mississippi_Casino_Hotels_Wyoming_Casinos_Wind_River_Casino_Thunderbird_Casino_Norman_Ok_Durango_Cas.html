<p>TVBET, a leading provider of live casino games, has expanded its African footprint through a partnership deal with Bitville Gaming, a well-established odds and iGaming solutions provider.</p>
<p>TVBET Teams with Bitville Gaming</p>
<p>The new agreement will help TVBET capitalize on its operations in the continent. In addition, local fans will be able to experience the provider’s critically-acclaimed suite of top-notch live casino titles. This includes PokerBet, Blackjack, War of the Elements, 7Bet and many others.</p>
<p>By partnering with TVBET, companies can add many engaging games to their platforms. Because of the quality of TVBET’s titles, it has been a much-coveted partner to companies within the industry.</p>
<p>Andrew Von Hoesslin, the chief executive officer of Bitville Gaming, is looking forward to working with the new partner. He said that his company is committed to bringing high-quality content to bettors in Africa. Therefore, Hoesslin is happy to join forces with TVBET and introduce its content to gamblers in the region.</p>
<p>It is very rewarding to bring a variety of products to the African Market as this has been our commitment and vision from the start of our journey, our TVBET partnership makes that happen and we will continue to forge ahead with great commitment and tenacity as always. It’s a great product run by a great team. Andrew Von Hoesslin, CEO, Bitville Gaming</p>
<p>TVBET Goes Live in Eswatini</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Bitbille Gaming helped TVBET’s games launch on Pigg’s Peak Casino’s online platform. Pigg’s Peak is an operator of both online and retail gambling in Eswatini (Swaziland), Africa.</p>
<p>The operator was happy to add TVBET’s acclaimed live casino solutions to its online offerings. Willie Delport of Piggs Peak Casino shared more about his company’s thoughts on the matter:</p>
<p>We are delighted to have launched TVBET as one of our products and look forward to the games being a success and adding high value to our brand. We believe that it is important to cater to the various players across the board and considering these players we have selected games that appeal to each category, basically, there is something for everybody, so no matter who you are, if you log in to our site, you are guaranteed to find something which appeals to you. Willie Delport, Pigg Peak Casino</p>
<p>Just as Delport said, TVBET is committed to offering a diverse selection of games to its partners. At the beginning of this month, the company released yet another game, namely Spin2Wheels. The latter is a live lottery game that offers players the chance to win great prizes.</p>
