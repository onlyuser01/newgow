<p>I don't think anything in their account is right for them. However, this does not change the fact that the way they pass information and communicate with the player is appalling, if they decide to freeze / close the account or check the origin of the deposit, the player must always be given a logical explanation and be able to defend themselves. As far as verification is concerned, it unfortunately depends on the casino and the staff, what documents are required of the player, what you describe is overall, and in addition they may perceive Czech players as risky, hence the call.</p>
