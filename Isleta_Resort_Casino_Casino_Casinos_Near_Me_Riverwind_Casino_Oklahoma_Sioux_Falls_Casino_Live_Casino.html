    <h1>Isleta Resort Casino Casino Casinos Near Me Riverwind Casino Oklahoma Sioux Falls Casino Live Casino</h1>

<p>I was fortunate to of won over 6k playing blackjack at Planet 7 Casino after a bonus deposit. I executed the play through based on their specific terms and then won the rest of my money playing blackjack. When I had used this bonus, the verbiage on the bonus explained the bonus play through but nothing to the effect that any non allowed games winnings would be voided after the play through.</p>
<p>I was informed upon inquiring why my winnings were voided (I had to inquire, I received no communications) that there was a specific t&amp;c that said that bonus money would be voided if non allowed games winnings were accrued, even after play through. Which in my opinion contained extremely confusing verbiage. It mentions bonus in the term. Of which during the play through the funds show up in the bonus balance. When the play through was executed that amount switched to the real money balance. How would any reasonable player assume that this is still considered a bonus if the own casino doesn’t even call it that.</p>
<p>Additional, how are they allowing players to bet on games where they can’t win anything? At best this is an extremely shady and predatory practice by this online casino. I didn’t understand this term in the way it was eventually communicated to me. From my perspective it just really feels like Planet 7 is interested in finding any and all ways to deny someone their winnings. What would be the difference if I had withdrawn the money, redeposited and then played on blackjack? I would assume there is zero difference.</p>
<p>It really feels like Planet 7 is only concerned about making money at any cost. If I were to lose my money betting, they would surely take that money but now that I’ve won over 6k, they utilize this, in my opinion, ambiguous and shady t&amp;c to deny someone who wins. I’ve never been on an online casino where that is even apart of the T&amp;C. And every other online casino I’ve ever been on doesn’t allow you to play a game if you can’t actually win at it.</p>
<p>Not to mention that their communication was abhorrent. I had to find out all of this information by inquiring on my own with their customer service. I’m just at a lost here. I’ve never been treated this poorly by a casino before. I asked their customer service several times to escalate the issue and it never was. This is just not right. Not at all and I sincerely hope that it gets reversed. Thank you.</p>
