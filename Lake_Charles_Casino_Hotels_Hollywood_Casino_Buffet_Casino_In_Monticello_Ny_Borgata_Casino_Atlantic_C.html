<p>Evolution Gaming’s games now part of SG’s Open Gaming System</p>
<p>This is a second milestone partnership for the companies together</p>
<p>EG continues to post steady financial results throughout the year.</p>
<p>Global live casino solutions provider Evolution Gaming has expanded its existing partnership with Scientific Games. As a result, EG games will now be featured on the Open Gaming System developed by SG.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming and SG Expand partnership</p>
<p>Global leader in live casino games Evolution Gaming has extended its partnership with Scientific Games (SG). As a result, the Live Casino solutions provided by Evolution will now be featured on the Open Gaming System (OGS) distribution network, property of SG.</p>
<p>According to the official press release, the companies followed up on a number of successful deployments in Canada, teaming up with the British Columbia Lottery Corporation and LotoQuebec. Similarly, Evolution has made its products available at Resorts Casino Hotel and Kindred Group in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, Evolution America &amp; Land-based Chief Business Development Officer James Stern had this to say:</p>
<p>We have worked with Scientific Games for a number of years on exclusive game content and we are glad to extend this relationship and have Evolution’s Live Casino available on the Scientific Games platform.</p>
<p>Scientific Games was equally excited with the news. Casino SVP Dylan Slaney from SG Digital explained that the integration of Evolution’s Live Casino games to the OpenGaming ecosystem was an important step for the company.</p>
<p>As an aggregator, Open Gaming strives to integrate the best world-class products, Slaney specified. As a result, players from the U.S. will be able to enjoy “feature-rich multi-studio content and experiences.”</p>
<p>Working on Ultimate Texas Hold’em in 2016</p>
<p>The company’s partnerships began back in January 2016, when Evolution and SG signed a partnership to develop Ultimate Texas Hold’em live version. While most casinos generally separate between their card rooms and casinos, Evolution Gaming sought to offer an alternative way to play poker live without visiting an actual casino.</p>
<p>By the company’s estimates, as at the time of the deal, Texas Hold’em was generating over $1.66 billion in Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR). The numbers only applied to land-based casinos. Evolution Gaming’s idea was to turn Texas Hold’em into a fully scalable solution, allowing an unlimited number of players to participate in the live casino.</p>
<p>Operating Revenue Grows for EG</p>
<p>Among a rapid succession of expansion moves, Evolution Gaming has seen its Q1, 2019 results soar 54% increase in total operating revenues. Q2, 2019 results hit over $94 million, marking a 45% increase year-over-year (YOY).</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming’s products have been polished to the point that content has begun appearing on Twitch and YouTube, popular streaming platforms. The company also won the EGR Italy Award for the Best Casino Content Supplier of 2019 on October 4.</p>
