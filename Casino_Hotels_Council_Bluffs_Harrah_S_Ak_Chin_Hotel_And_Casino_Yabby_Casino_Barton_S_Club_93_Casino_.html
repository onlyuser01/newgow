    <h1>Casino Hotels Council Bluffs Harrah S Ak Chin Hotel And Casino Yabby Casino Barton S Club 93 Casino</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>So i made 100€ deposit to this Posido site 18.09.2023. I did win money and played money rounds in site. After i stopped playing my balance was 1376€ and i wanted to do withdraw. When i tried to do withdraw there was some "error" "you have to wager deposit 1x". Well i had wagered more than 100€ already. 500€ i think i wagered. Well still it says you have to wager 1x deposit.</p>
<p>Then i did go to support and they told me they will do withdraw manually. 25.09.2023 They did manual withdraw 500€+500€+376€ in separate. Now i logged to my account and i see 500€ in my casino balance and i see that those manual withdraws done my support have somehow failed and money is back in my casino balance and not in my bank account.</p>
<p>Now when i go to support they give me these random excuses that i have to update google etcetc.. and i need to wager again 500e+500e to make withdraw??</p>
<p>Support did manual "withdraw" and then money came back to my account as "deposit".</p>
