<p>A new industry partnership has been formed as the Mohegan Tribe has signed an agreement with the business-to-business software solutions and services provider VizExplorer.</p>
<p>VizExplorer Will Help the Mohegan Tribe to Make the Casino More Appealing</p>
<p>As per the deal, VizExplorer will power the Mohegan Tribe with various marketing solutions. VizExplorer’s marketing job will be focused on spreading the word of the Mohegan Tribe’s Mohegan Sun Pocono casino resort in Pennsylvania. The software provider will use its knowledge in the field of marketing to propagate the Mohegan Tribe’s betting offerings across the whole Northeastern United States.</p>
<p>The software firm’s job will be facilitated by the casino’s appealing location. Mohegan Sun Pocono is situated in Plains County, Pennsylvania, on a key crossroad between Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Philadelphia and has the potential to attract bettors from all these states. Not only is Mohegan Sun Pocono easily accessible, but it also has a lot to offer to visitors. The 400-acre venue is equipped with a comfortable hotel and spa, offers food and various shops, and is an overall likable place to visit.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mohegan Sun Pocono boasts of a gargantuan 82,000 square feet-large gaming space that is equipped with 1,800 slot machines and electronic table games and offers 50 real-life table games.</p>
<p>The CampaignViz Solution Will Come Into Play</p>
<p>Still, to boost the success of the marketing campaign even further, VizExplorer will tap into its campaignViz solution. In VizExplorer’s words, this will help to simplify player segmentation, streamline campaign creation and analysis. Additionally, campaignViz will automate the offer management and will optimize the campaign further.</p>
<p>David Patent, the chief executive officer of VizExplorer, spoke on the deal with the tribal bookmaker. Patent said that he and the whole VizExplorer team are excited to join forces with the Mohegan Tribe and add the Mohegan Sun Pocono property to the VizExplorer family.</p>
<p>“We look forward to partnering with the Mohegan Sun Pocono team and enabling their team to advance their direct marketing capabilities,” Patent said.</p>
<p>David Parfrey, the vice president of marketing at Mohegan Sun Pocono, also spoke on the partnership. He said that he is excited to see the financial impact that VizExplorer’s marketing campaign is going to leave on the venue’s business. Parfrey said that he is confident that VizExplorer fully understands the tribe’s business and will use its fantastic solutions to help the tribe execute its strategy.</p>
<p>Both parties are confident about the upcoming marketing campaign and are excited to make Mohegan Sun Pocono an appealing destination for tourists from neighboring states.</p>
