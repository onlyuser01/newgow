<p>The Diversity and Inclusion Network will launch on March 22 and will be the first of its kind in the island country</p>
<p>Betsson Group, a leader in iGaming, has proudly unveiled the launch of the first Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) Network in Malta. As announced by the company, this new network will promote inclusivity and diverse workplace culture in Malta and beyond.</p>
<p>The launch of this network comes in the wake of last year’s D&amp;I conferences. It highlights Betsson Group’s commitment to turning Malta into an exemplary region in terms of diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Betsson explained that the new network’s goal is to provide a platform for dialogue and discussion when it comes to diversity, inclusion and belonging. It will incentivize conversations and will provide all the practical tools and resources that organizations or individuals might need to make a positive impact.</p>
<p>As noted by Betsson Group, the D&amp;I network will promote inclusivity across many industries.</p>
<p>The Network Will Launch in Three Weeks</p>
<p>Betsson Group will inaugurate the network during a half-day launch event on Wednesday, March 22. It will take place at the Experience Centre in Ta’ Xbiex, Malta and will see notable Betsson executives share more insight into the network’s purpose and goals.</p>
<p>Lena Nordin, the company’s chief resources officer, and Maria Loumpourdi, the head of Talent Development will hold a presentation on Betsson Group’s approach to diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Nordin explained more about the vision behind the network ahead of the half-day launch event. She noted that the group is excited to pioneer such a network in the island country and connect like-minded people.</p>
<p>We believe that diversity drives innovation and success. And we are excited to launch the first D&amp;I Network in Malta, where we can connect with others who share similar values and work together to create a more inclusive and diverse workplace culture that benefits all. Lena Nordin, chief resources officer, Betsson Group</p>
<p>During the launch event, Betsson Group will also host an open roundtable discussion. Attendees will be free to participate and share their personal ideas and feelings on how to shape the new D&amp;I network to meet the needs of the Maltese industries.</p>
<p>Betsson Group concluded that all individuals and organizations that want to promote diversity and inclusion are welcome to join the network. The gambling holding noted that companies sharing its values are invited to join regardless of their industry or size.</p>
<p>In other news, a few days ago, Betsson Group adopted Neccton’s mentor solution and incorporated it into its Betsafe gambling brand. Soon after, the gambling holding announced the appointment of the Spanish-born padel player Cayetano Rocafort as a brand ambassador.</p>
