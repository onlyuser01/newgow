    <h1>Casino Pier Elko Nevada Casinos Choctaw Grant Casino Casino Game Quest Casino Spokane Illinois Mayor</h1>

<p>Local news outlets say that the mayor visited Las Vegas earlier this year with a first-class flight that cost almost $4,000</p>
<p>Tiffany Henyard, the controversial mayor of Dolton, Illinois, has been accused of misusing taxpayer money to fund, among other things, a trip to Las Vegas. While it is not certain whether she gambled or not, Henyard continues to attract people’s hostility through her actions.</p>
<p>Dolton is a small town of roughly 22,000 people in the vicinity of Chicago. It has been headed by Henyard since 2021 when she was elected as mayor. Since then, Henyard’s lavish lifestyle and alleged misuse of taxpayer money have turned her into a very controversial figure.</p>
<p>Local news outlets say that the mayor visited Las Vegas earlier this year with a first-class flight that cost almost $4,000. She spent a lot more money (approximately $8,400) on a hotel in the city, as well as several hundred more on premium dining.</p>
<p>Henyard refused to comment on the matter with journalists, providing no details about her journey.</p>
<p>Henyard Says She Is God’s Favorite</p>
<p>The trip to Vegas is not Dolton mayor’s only controversial move. Henyard, who earns $46,000 a year plus an additional $224,000 because of her township supervisor job, is well-known for her huge expenses.</p>
<p>Labeling herself “God’s favorite,” Henyard employs a personal stylist and security guards. She has a personal brand that she actively promotes and has produced music videos featuring her dancing with city workers. According to Henyard, all her critics are just “haters.”</p>
<p>In addition, the mayor passed an ordinance that would reduce the township supervisor’s salary to just $25,000 if she is not reelected. Many believe that this measure is not only illegal but a move to dissuade her political opponents from challenging her position.</p>
<p>However, her most controversial move has been appointing Lavelle Redmond, 46, a convicted child rapist who served 24 years in prison, as a code enforcement officer. In this position, Redmond, who participated in the gang rape of two girls, aged 13 and 14, was required to inspect people’s homes and businesses.</p>
