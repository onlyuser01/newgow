<p>Casumo, an online casino that prides itself on its free deposits and fast payouts, has made a foray into the Canadian province of Ontario. This launch is a key strategic move that will allow the operator to target one of the most profitable iGaming markets.</p>
<p>Casumo Has Launched Its Online Offerings in Ontario</p>
<p>Ever since the launch of iGaming in Ontario earlier this year, it has been one of the most attractive markets for online gambling operators. Casumo is one of the many companies seeking to tap into the province’s fresh iGaming scene. The gaming firm received approval to launch in the province this summer and is now ready to engage local gamblers.</p>
<p>Following the operator’s launch in the province, Ontarian players can now visit Casumo’s site or download the mobile app to play. The latter is available for both Android and iOS, allowing players to digitally access the operator’s exciting offerings.</p>
<p>By playing with Casumo, gamblers can access a myriad of slots and table games. In addition, the operator offers a whole line of live dealer games, such as roulette variants, blackjack, baccarat, wheel games and texas hold ‘em. The digital mobile-optimized aspect of these products allows Casumo players to carry a great portable casino in their pockets.</p>
<p>McGibbon Is Thrilled to Offer Gaming to Local Customers</p>
<p>Casumo’s vice president of commercial, Garry McGibbon commented on the launch in Ontario. He said that his team feels excited to be one of the pioneers in the province’s fairly new online gambling market. According to McGibbon, the launch attests to the agility of the company’s team and products.</p>
<p>McGibbon added that the company is looking forward to providing local players with an easily-accessible casino packed full of games.</p>
<p>We’re excited to get going with our plans to bring Casumo magic to the fingertips of players all across Ontario. Garry McGibbon</p>
<p>Casumo is a primarily European operator that is now seeking to expand into other regions as well. The company was founded a decade ago and currently operates several gaming brands in some of Europe’s biggest regulated jurisdictions. The company has a presence in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany and Sweden, among others.</p>
<p>While Casumo opened 2022 with a player protection-oriented partnership, the operator still had some shortcomings and managed to get into trouble with the Spillemyndigheden, Denmark’s gambling regulator. The authority noted that the shortcomings date to March 11 this year, when Casumo failed to assess risk on its mobile app. While Casumo quit the Danish market on April 18, the Spillemyndigheden argues that it is still responsible for its prior wrongdoings.</p>
