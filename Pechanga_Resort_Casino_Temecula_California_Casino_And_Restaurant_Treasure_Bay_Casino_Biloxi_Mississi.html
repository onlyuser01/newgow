    <h1>Pechanga Resort Casino Temecula California Casino And Restaurant Treasure Bay Casino Biloxi Mississi</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>try to calm down, please. The complaint team will look into it.</p>
<p>Kindly note that it is quite unwise to register more than one account, as you can see it is a vialotion of terma and conditins. Always use only one account to play in the casino, so you can spare yourself such unpleasant experience 🙏.</p>
<p>The main point is whether you gained or did not gain any unfair advantage over the casino by breaching this rule, this is what the team will try to find out.</p>
<p>In the past, this specific rule was made to protect casino against bonus hunters, but it's commonly used against casual players as well, read more about that here.</p>
<p>Allow me to quote here:</p>
<p>" Note: Please don’t create more than 1 account in 1 casino! You’ll never ever get paid anyway and you can piss the casino off and they may stop giving this bonus in the future. When I asked affiliate managers why they don’t want to give bonuses to players from certain countries, they replied that they had a lot of players from some countries with 10-20 accounts. They didn’t have to pay for any wins but they had to pay to the game provider for the free spins anyway. "</p>
<p>I wish you fair result with the complaint 🤞</p>
