<p>The company that leases, develops and operates gaming properties around the US, Full House Resorts, is getting closer to opening a new location in Waukegan, Illinois</p>
<p>The process related to the new casino location in Waukegan is lengthy. Yet, a new report reveals that the operator secured important approvals which help clear the path and may enable Full House Resorts to start the building process this year.</p>
<p>Full House Resorts Secures Approvals in Waukegan</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the City Council approved the company’s development and lease agreement, Lake County News-Sun revealed. This means that Full House Resorts would now seek approval from the gambling regulator in the state, the Illinois Gaming Board (IGB). Such approval would enable the operator to proceed with opening the new casino location.</p>
<p>However, the process itself isn’t as straightforward as it sounds. Per the development plan, initially Full House Resorts will build a temporary venue, which is likely to open its doors to visitors this year. Then, the developer is expected to start the work for a permanent casino resort which is planned to be completed in three years. Finally, once that permanent development is completed, a further extension that includes hotel accommodation can be completed in the following two years.</p>
<p>“The state gambling license is the last thing. We are approving the final documents to allow them to commence operations.“ Stewart Weiss corporation counsel for Waukegan, Illinois</p>
<p>Waukegan’s corporation counsel, Stewart Weiss, acknowledged that the latest approvals mark a major step for Full House Resorts and are needed before the gambling regulator gives approval for the temporary casino to start operating. He pointed out that the company will now go through “inspections and licensing with the IGB.” Still, Weiss pointed out that licensing marks the final step before the developer can commence operations.</p>
<p>The Project Is Expected to Deliver Taxes, Boost the Local Economy</p>
<p>The massive project planned for Waukegan is expected to boost tourism and bring economic stimulus to the region. What’s more, the city’s coffers will receive a boost from licensing fees, as well as taxes. This will undoubtedly benefit Waukegan’s economy to recover quickly from the impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Besides retail gambling, hospitality and other entertainment venues, there’s a lot of potential in the online gambling market in Illinois. But it is yet to be confirmed whether or not lawmakers will take a step forward toward legalizing the activity.</p>
