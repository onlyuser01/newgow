<p>Hub88 has expanded its reach in the Latin American market and specifically helped Betsson Group, a prominent international gaming operator, to consolidate its local presence through the introduction of the Bombay Live’s content portfolio as part of the group’s operations in Argentina.</p>
<p>Hub88 wants to be seen as a go-to option for companies looking to significantly strengthen their presence in the region and specifically through the deployment of exclusive and innovative products such as the Bombay Live portfolio of games.</p>
<p>Among the games that Hub88 provides to Betsson Group from Bombay Live are Baccarat and Roulette and the partnership is possible as all entities have met the necessary regulatory and licensure prerequisites. Betsson will benefit from localized and high-performing content that is designed to appeal to players and create valuable opportunities for players of all hues.</p>
<p>Hub88 Head Ollie Castleman has welcomed this opportunity and said that the proprietary studio, read Bombay Live, is indeed a brand that focuses on creating excellent experiences that allow partner operators to strengthen their presence in important markets.</p>
<p>"Expanding our geographical reach will be a key goal for us in 2024 and together with Betsson we look forward to widening the net in LatAm," Castleman noted.</p>
<p>Betsson Group Commercial Development, Business Development at Betsson Group, Kevin Saliba, said that the opportunity to team up with Hub88 was indeed fantastic and an important moment for Bombay Live as a whole. It was a no-brainer to establish this partnership, Saliba further clarified.</p>
<p>Hub88 has been growing its aggregation and software solution of late, with many prominent suppliers joining its network. Recently, Playson boosted its European footprint through a tie-up with the company. Another noteworthy content developer, Peter &amp; Sons, also became a part of the company’s offer last year.</p>
<p>As to Betsson Group, the company has not been relenting in its own pursuit of building solid products across the board and doing so reliably. The company has recently scaled up its alliance with Light &amp; Wonder to cover more jurisdictions. Meanwhile, both Betsson and Hub88 remain committed to ensuring that they are well-represented in local markets in Latin America.</p>
<p>The entry into Argentina for both is an important milestone, and the fact that they are now working together is another reason to celebrate.</p>
