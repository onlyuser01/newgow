<p>During its meeting on October 18, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) approved four consent agreements presented by the board’s Office of Enforcement Counsel (OEC). As a result, the Pennsylvanian regulator will hand a total of $73,075 in fines to a number of bodies that violated the local gambling rules.</p>
<p>The PGCB explained that the fines resulted from the negotiations between the OEC and three license holders representing two casinos and a Video Game Terminal (VGT) company. The fined bodies include Stadium Casino Westmoreland, Love’s Travel Shops &amp; Country Stores and Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment.</p>
<p>The PGCB added that copies of the approved consent agreements with the three licensees can be requested from the Board’s Office of Communications.</p>
<p>Three Companies Will Have to Pay Fines</p>
<p>The three companies received varying penalties in accordance with their offenses. Stadium Casino Westmoreland, which operates Live! Casino Pittsburgh in Westmoreland County, received two fines totaling $30,000.</p>
<p>The first fine was in relation to two instances where the casino allowed self-excluded people to gamble. According to the PGCB, Stadium Casino’s property allowed two such people to enter its premises and play. Because of that, the company will have to pay a fine of $20,000.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Stadium Casino will have to pay an additional fine of $10,000 for allowing an underage person to enter Live! Casino Pittsburgh’s gaming floor and gamble.</p>
<p>The second company that received a fine is Love’s Travel Stops &amp; Country Stores, which, according to the PGCB, failed to provide the regulator with ownership structure changes involving its five VGT Truck Shop Establishment properties. As a result, the company will have to pay a $25,000 fine.</p>
<p>Finally, Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, which operates Parx Casino in Bucks Country, will be subjected to a fine of $18,075 because of a licensing issue. According to the PGCB, the company failed to submit two license renewal applications in time, prompting regulatory intervention.</p>
<p>The PGCB concluded that it will hold another meeting on November 15. The meeting is set to take place in the board’s Public Hearing Room on the second floor of the Strawberry Square Complex in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>In other news, the PGCB just published its industry report for September, reporting a revenue growth across most of the digital verticals. Gaming revenue from most traditional verticals, however, was on the decline.</p>
