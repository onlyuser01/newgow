    <h1>Argosy Casino Alton Il Sweep Coins Casino Seneca Niagara Casino Photos Choctaw Casino Grant Isleta R</h1>

<p>Im gonna need to see proof of that, it doesnt even make sense. One couldnt create a second account on the same casino using the same username/email its impossible. Because then there would be two accounts with the same Login how would you login if the login Matches multiple accounts, it doesnt make sense. As I said before I created one account on winnerame, one on lucky draw and one on tangiers. All accounts exactly identical information because my information has not changed. It is against the rules to have multiple accounts on one casino but not to have multiple accounts on different casinos. I have one account per casino not more not less. If it Shows up to them as three duplicate Accounts its because they use the same Database for all three of their casinos. They own three casinos and I created only one account per casino. It doesnt even make sense how could it be against the rules to create a new account at a different casino, so you are only allowed to play one casino for the rest of your life or what? Show me the rule a player is not allowed to make a new account on a different casino! If the username and email are the same for all accounts they have clearly taken my accounts from different casinos and say they are on the same casino, which is a lie and Impossible. I dare you to create to accounts on the same casino using all the same information, it wont let you it will say username already taken or email already taken, which proves the accounts are on Different casinos.</p>
