    <h1>Catawba Casino Casino Ocean City Maryland Raging Bull Casino 100 Free Chip 2023 New Crypto Casinos T</h1>

<p>I never expected I'd reach at this point posting and asking for help as I trusted the bitgame.com platform.</p>
<p>July 27, 2022. The whole day that I was playing(speed baccarat only), losing and depositing I ended up winning 18,000usdt. As per my VIP level(6) I am allowed to withdraw of 7,800 limit a day so I did an application for withdrawal. So I had a balance left of 10,200 USDT after couple of hours I played again and won 5,046 so balance went up to 15,246USDT so I had total winning 23,046 minus my 1st withdrawal application of 7,800 thats why the total left was 15,246USDT, then when my withdrawal time limit restarted(10hrs after my 1st withdrawal) I withdrew again 7,800 and left a balance of 7,446 and total of 2 withdrawal application with 7,800 each(total 15,600) the day after they have not approved yet my withdrawals as they said that had to review it first. So what were pending withdrawal application are (1st) 7,800 (2nd) 7800 and wallet balance of 7,446. so what I did was I applied withdrawal for the left balance of 7,446 (3 withdrawal application total 23,046) so I have 3 total pending withdrawals already with them Then they approved my (1st) 7800 withdrawal application and left the 2nd withdrawal application of 7,800 and 3th withdrawal of 7,446 total of 15,246 pending as couple of days has passed I kept following up with them then I started to complain and this is what they said:</p>
<p>" The platform passed your previous withdrawal because although your withdrawal amount was large, there was no problem after the review of the security department, so it passed. However, in the subsequent betting, there was a betting involving abnormal data. Because this game is provided by the game supplier, the relevant data needs to be provided by them. As you said before, why did we pass the previous order? It is all in accordance with the platform rules. We have no right to block the order without problems. The current process is stuck on the side of the game supplier. We are also particularly anxious and have been negotiating, hoping to complete it as soon as possible. What I can do is to use my authority and constantly urge the relevant person in charge to speed up communication. I want to complete the process as soon as possible than you."</p>
<p>After couple of days following up and still no positive update as theyre still waiting for the SUPPLIER’s feedback</p>
<p>And I asked them these:</p>
<p>" I have 2 concerns.</p>
<ol>
<li>If there was a problem/abnormal data ONLY in my subsequent betting(as you’ve said) which is after I won the 18,000usdt then you supposed to hold only the amount exceeding winnings/bettings AFTER/OVER 18,000usdt. Because if there was a problem/abnormal data before I won the 18,000usdt then you would also have frozen my 3 INITIAL withdrawals(7,800 which you approved) BUT you DID NOT because as you have said there was NO problem/abnormal data during my 1st winnings. And, ONLY in my subsequent betting there was ONE abnormal data/order. Then why you are freezing the rest of the amount of 10,200(balance after 1st(3) initial withdrawals that you approved from my initial winning of 18,000)?</li>
</ol>
<p>As you supposed to hold ONLY my subsequent bettings/winnings AFTER/OVER 18,000usdt which is 5,046 ONLY. which makes my total winning of 23,046</p>
<ol>
<li>But what is happening now is your holding both amounts and taking so much time for the data review of supplier to your platform that badly affects me.</li>
</ol>
<p>These 2 were my concerns that has not been answered by the platform but THEN again it’s been delayed for too much. The platform had to understand and review this case thoroughly. As it was the SUPPLIER’s delay that is affecting the platform and especially ME."</p>
<p>And they didn't address or acknowledged my concerns but what they always say that they're still following up with the supplier and I even asked for escalation which never happened and I was sending email to support@bitgame.com, service@bitgame.com and business@bitgame.com to get an escalation but they never responded even once.</p>
