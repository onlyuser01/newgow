<p>Lady Luck Games is getting another boost to its game distribution capacities through a new alliance with Relax Gaming. This will allow the Swedish developer of innovative and award-winning iGaming content to use the Relax Gaming aggregation solution to quickly reach new audiences and operators.</p>
<p>The partnership essentially places Lady Luck Games as part of the Powered By Relax distribution program, which is a powerful way to distribute content and reach new audiences. Lady Luck Games has been building up a reputation for itself very quickly.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2019 and quickly released dozens of games that have become its own signature style. With titles such as Beetle Bailey Camp Swampy, Astro Anna and Spin Joy SocietyMegaways, the company’s first megaways game, Lady Luck Games has been a capable supplier.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the company will also be able to distribute games like The Treasures of Tizoc and Valholl Wild Hammers, and Madame Clues, among others. Lady Luck Games Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Mads Jørgensen was happy with the news and excited at what it meant for the company’s long-term positioning as a trusted supplier of iGaming products.</p>
<p>Jørgensen confirmed that his company is looking to collaborate in the long-term with Relax Gaming and offer content to many operators out in the market. The agreement is a chance for Lady Luck Games to move forward and explore new chances of grwoth and success. Relax Gaming already features more than 4,000 online casino games that are distributed directly with partner operators.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest partnership, Relax Director of Casino Products Shelley Hannah said that this would make for a fruitful partnership. Hannah welcomed the opportunity to add a supplier that features interesting mechanics that are unmatched in the iGaming market and elevate the gameplay for all.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lady Luck Games has been committed to expanding its footprint significantly across the board. The company teamed up with Logrand Entertainment Group, a Mexico-based company and its Strendus.mx brand. Similarly, Relax Gaming has been growing its list of partners with a number of partners, adding the likes of Octopus Global and Peter &amp; Sons.</p>
