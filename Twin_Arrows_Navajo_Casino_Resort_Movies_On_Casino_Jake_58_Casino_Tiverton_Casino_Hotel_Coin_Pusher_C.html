    <h1>Twin Arrows Navajo Casino Resort Movies On Casino Jake 58 Casino Tiverton Casino Hotel Coin Pusher C</h1>

<p>So i am a regular at this casino and have never had an issue. I logged in tonight and the website layout was totally different as they had adapted that crummy blah generic format that most RTG casinos use (the ones that aren’t using Inclave). It was really slow and buggy and I immediately hated it. But anyway I tried plugging in the code i had received via email from the casino to try out the new game Neon Wheel 7s. It didn’t work so I asked support for help and they put it in for me. 50 spins at .05 a spin yielded $7.31 that I had to wager 45x over ($328.95) for a max cash out of $100. Pretty standard. I upped the bet to 50 cents and played for a while. I went up and down a bit but just as I was gonna strike out k got the wheel and won the $500 jackpot. I immediately asked support if it was a jackpot I could keep or did I have to wager it down. They said I’d have to wager it down, which the agent told me still left $298 to go. I was like whatever I’ll play it down and take the $100. So I’m at $500, and I need to wager basically $300 to get it auto-deduct to $100. So I upped the bet to $10, and placed my bets counting each one as I went. The website is super buggy so it kept reloading the page every two minutes or so, but only did so once during this period. All of a sudden my balance dropped from $300 not to $100 but down to $4.16. I had only bet $10 twenty-two times (I know because I counted!) but the agent said that my balance dropped to $96 and then I continued wagering another $110 since then. That would mean that half of my counted wagers would have been in those final seconds - which isn’t true at all - and that I wagered thirty times plus an additional eleven…which is completely bogus. Anyway they are rigidly defending the lie that I did so. There’s just no way. The only explanation I can think of is that their stupid buggy website when it was lagging and reloading counted some of my wagers double or triple the times the actual times I hit the button. Because I know online casinos are shady and every chance they get to not pay you they will take. I’m just calling bullshit on this one because that ain’t right.</p>
