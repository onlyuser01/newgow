    <h1>Buffalo Casinos Casinos In San Diego County Yaamava Resort Casino San Manuel Blvd Highland Ca Ltc Ca</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I understand your pain villeoinas and ugcn.</p>
<p>I am a very inexperienced player myself. It happened to me about a year ago that I won more than 4000 euros with a deposit of 10 e. That's when I started these game jobs. At the time I was playing Tombstone RIP at Wazamba casino.</p>
<p>The casino's KYC measures really stressed me out. I even had to go through a video call where the face of the person from our area was visible, but not the identity of the interviewer. The interview was conducted in English. The interviewer was a cheerful young woman and it sounded to me that she spoke English in a Finnish way, etc.</p>
<p>In the end, I got my money. from the casino, although it took a long time (=several weeks).</p>
<p>The Casino Guru website was a big help in getting the matter resolved!</p>
<p>I thought I would ease your pain by telling the above anecdote.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that I won a couple of hundred euros from the Bet'n'flix casino. In order to get my money at that time, I had to send pictures of electricity etc. bills and my own face combined with my driver's license, etc. However, there was no need to make a video call with them ðŸ™‚ Still, it took many days. However, the money came out ok in the end.</p>
<p>And look, when I suddenly don't believe it, I re-invested 10 euros in Bet'n'Flix casino last week. I never put more at once. This time I won 100 euros. The money came to my account in a couple of days.</p>
<p>I hope everything is going well for the rest of you. I wish big wins for each type! Thanks also to Casino Guru for the help.</p>
