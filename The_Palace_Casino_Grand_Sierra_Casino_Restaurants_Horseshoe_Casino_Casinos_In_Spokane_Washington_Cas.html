    <h1>The Palace Casino Grand Sierra Casino Restaurants Horseshoe Casino Casinos In Spokane Washington Cas</h1>

<p>A deposited without a bonus I had thought I realized during play when I went to go withdraw that I that they had attached a bonus to my deposit I talked to the support people and told them I did not want the bonus as I had not attached one to it because that's not how I normally play I do not use bonuses unless they are no deposit or no rules and I asked them to remove the bonus from my deposit they said you already have 33% played through and my bet never exceeded 0.0003 not once that was the max bet that I bet the whole time during my play before and after talking to them okay so I was like okay I'll continue playing with it then cuz 33% it wouldn't be that bad then okay so I continued playing nothing none of what I was playing was affecting my playthrough I played I was playing different games a little bit none of it expected my players so I went back and I talked to support I was like what was the bet and games that I was playing it took me an hour to finally get them to actually communicate with me that wasn't BS rigamoral trying to tell me send me in circles so I quit asking anyway they finally told me the game and the bed and I went back to the game in the bed and continued playing at which like I said as I said it never once exceeded 0.00003 any but I made and they already knew that that was a bet that I had made because I had been playing and they went and looked at my play they looked at my everything to tell me before while they were showing me the or telling me that I had a bonus there they encouraged me to go in play again instead of removing my bone or removing the bonus like I said and asked for then I when I got to where I wanted to withdraw I went and I initiated the withdraw and I waited and I waited and I waited and I waited and I asked them what's taking so long for my withdraw and I gotta BS answer and asked again well it takes time for him to do the which on the page out and everything and it's fine and everything don't worry and blah hours and hours and hours later I get an email saying that my that it was rejected because I had exceeded the amount per bet for the bonus which is a bunch of BS they could have given me my deposit back then when it happened earlier instead of if that was the case for the bonus they are just not wanting to pay me my withdraw my payout.</p>
