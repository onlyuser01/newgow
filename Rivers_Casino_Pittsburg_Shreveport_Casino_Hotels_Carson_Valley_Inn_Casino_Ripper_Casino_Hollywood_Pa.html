    <h1>Rivers Casino Pittsburg Shreveport Casino Hotels Carson Valley Inn Casino Ripper Casino Hollywood Pa</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>one of the main problem is that Euromoon Casino doesn't have a game history at all. Secondly, I assume (but not 100% certain) they have ripped off Betsoft games, which makes it even harder to even ask a check from the game provider either.</p>
<p>I'm absolutely sure that I didn't place the one strange bigger size bet suddenly that was used as an excuse to avoid paying my winnings and framing me to breach the bonus terms. The altered bet size was exactly twice the amount I played pretty much all the time. That manipulation was done only to one game round.</p>
<p>It doesn't make any sense that I would make such a bet suddenly.</p>
<p>Gathering information from many respected gambing review and support sites: Askgamblers, ThePogg, etc... I have strong hunch that we are dealing with crooks when it comes to Euromoon Casino. That makes me very pessimistic and sceptic about retrieving my confiscated account balance. The most important thing anymore is that I want to warn others.</p>
<p>First, Euromoon Casino removed my winnings and returned my balance back to my original 100 EUR deposit. But after they were informed that I will spread the word about this and start sending complaints and investigation requests suddenly without any notice or reason they further removed my 100 EUR balance, my comp points and in their messages (between the lines) tried to make me ask a closure of my account - acting that way, like a teenager's tantrum, is very unprofessional and just exposed their true nature even more.</p>
<p>And until now the casino doesn't update / reply anything.</p>
<p>All in all, I leave this here from my side. I don't want to poke the beehive myself anymore. I'm honestly scared of them. They are dangerous fraudsters in my opinion. But if you can help with this case, it will be still highly appreciated.</p>
