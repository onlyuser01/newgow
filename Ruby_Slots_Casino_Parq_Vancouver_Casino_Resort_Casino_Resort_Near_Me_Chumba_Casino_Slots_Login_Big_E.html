<p>PlaySugarhouse.com is adding content by Novomatic’s interactive division, Greentube. The casino, which operates in New Jersey under the Rush Street Interactive banner, is stepping up its efforts to increase its relevant player-favorite content.</p>
<p>Greentube to Inject More Content for PlaySugarhouse Players</p>
<p>Greentube’s series of memorable and established products are a good fit for PlaySugarHouse’s overall strategy. Both companies hope to achieve greater engagement with local players. To this end, Greentube is landing its entire Diamond Cash series, including games such as Diamond Cash: Mighty Elephant, Diamond Cash: Mighty Sevens, and Diamond Cash: Mighty Santa, to the casino. PlaySugarHouse will also be adding Apollo God of the Sun and Prized Panda.</p>
<p>Greentube’s success in building mobile-friendly and compelling games has helped the company establish its footprint with leading brands in the United States and Latin America, similar to Rush Street Interactive’s own forays in those regions.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership opportunity, Greentube head of sales Markus Antl spoke about the significance of the collaboration:</p>
<p>“We are excited to go live with Rush Street Interactive in New Jersey. This is a big milestone for our long-term partnership with RSI, and it’s exciting to bring our top-performing and market-proven game content, like the Diamond Cash Series, to players in the US.” Greentube head of sales Markus Antl</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive’s Presence in IGaming Grows</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive CEO Richard Schwartz welcomed the latest addition of slots games and content to PlaySugarHouse’s growing portfolio of play opportunities.</p>
<p>Schwartz expressed confidence that PlaySugarHouse players would appreciate the offer. As RSI is operating in more markets – 12 and counting at the time of reporting – the company is also looking to bolster its content offering. IGaming is arguably the most lucrative gambling segment in the United States. Yet it has lagged behind the mass adoption push behind sports betting.</p>
<p>This has reflected on the number of available suppliers, which, in turn, has led to fewer games available. Greentube has been consistently delivering new products to change that. Greentube has already stated its US ambitions, previously joining forces with GAN to make its products available to more operators.</p>
