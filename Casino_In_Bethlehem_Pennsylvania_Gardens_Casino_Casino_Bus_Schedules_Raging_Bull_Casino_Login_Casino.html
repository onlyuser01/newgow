<p>Gaming Corps has been moving quickly, scaling its presence in both existing and brand-new markets. Today, we touch base with Danielle Calafato, the company's Chief Commercial Officer, to discuss how this expansion has been helpful to the supplier, and how the company has kept a firm focus on the markets it already operates in while analyzing fresh opportunities. Every move has been carefully planned to match Gaming Corps’ strategy of weighed and ambitious growth.</p>
<p>Q: Gaming Corps recently launched with First Look Games. Can you tell us how this helps your company and what specific advantages the rollout gives you?</p>
<p>Our partnership with First Look Games has proven to be advantageous for our company as we expand into new markets. The platform enables us to reach players in those markets and increase our visibility to potential customers. Additionally, the games we offer on the platform have been performing well, and reviews from other players are always beneficial in helping potential players choose which games they want to try. We see this as a significant opportunity to grow our presence and connect with new players around the world.</p>
<p>Q: Integration deals have been a big part of your most recent commercial partnerships – have you seen results already?</p>
<p>Integration deals have been a key component of our recent commercial partnerships, and we are already seeing positive results. Each new customer brings the potential for a significant positive impact on our business, and our goal is to reach as many players as possible through increased volume. However, we also recognize the importance of catering to specific markets. Our diverse content library includes various titles that are designed to maximize their potential within each market they serve. We believe these integration deals have helped us to expand our reach and better serve our customers.</p>
<p>Q: How important are affiliates and marketers in helping a studio succeed; even one that delivers products of remarkable quality?</p>
<p>Affiliates and marketers are essential in helping a studio succeed. Even the best games can fail if players are not aware they exist and are available. In today's highly competitive market, it is crucial for us to maximize all available routes to gain product discovery. This includes our commercial relationships, outreach to affiliates, and traditional marketing avenues such as events, advertising and social media. By leveraging these different channels, we can increase our visibility and reach more potential players, ultimately leading to greater success for our studio.</p>
<p>Q: Europe has been a clear priority for Gaming Corps over the past months. Do you see European markets as your strongest?</p>
<p>While Europe has been a key focus for us, we are also seeing steady growth in several other markets. Our products have been growing in popularity in Brazil in particular, and we've had great success with our recent launch in Greece. We are continually adding licenses and meeting regulatory requirements for more launches, keeping our pipeline busy. As a publicly listed company, our focus is on regulated markets, and our latest report shows impressive year-on-year growth of 628%. While we recognize the importance of Europe, we also see significant potential in other markets and will continue to pursue growth opportunities wherever they may arise.</p>
<p>Q: Are you planning to expand beyond Europe? What specific markets are you focusing on if expansion is already underway?</p>
<p>While we have been focusing on expanding into several new markets that are showing promising growth, we haven't lost sight of our existing ones. We have recently announced expansions into Italy and the Netherlands, and we continue to see positive results in our established markets. As for future expansion plans, we are always looking for opportunities to reinforce our presence in both existing and new markets, and it’s really a case of watching this space for the time being. Our priority is to carefully evaluate each potential opportunity and ensure it aligns with our strategic goals before moving forward with any expansion efforts.</p>
