    <h1>Ballys Hotel And Casino Atlantis Hotel And Casino Reno Muckleshoot Casino Auburn Wa Luckylands Casin</h1>

<p>After claiming a bonus on Telegram, where I was required to make a deposit of 50 reais on the game "Fortune Tiger", I was supposed to receive an additional 50 reais in order to execute a rollover of 3000 reais. Therefore, I started on the rollover and suddenly the game began to malfunction, it wouldn't open with either real or bonus balance. I reached out to customer support and they recommended a variety of solutions such as clearing my cache, among other things. However, I conducted other tests by logging into different accounts on my device and the game opened just fine without any errors. Conversely, when I logged into my account from other devices, I still couldn't load the game without it generating the same error repeatedly. Since last Friday, on the 10th of November 2023, I've been in touch with customer service but nothing has changed, they keep adding that they will pass the issue on to their technical department to rectify the problem, yet nothing has been done. Given that my rollover is due by the 20th of November 2023, I might end up losing out if the problem is left unresolved. After all, I ended up making a deposit of $50. I've tried every solution offered by the support team. The actual problem resides in my account, not with the website nor the game. As I've stated before, the game operates normally on other accounts and only malfunctions when I log into my account. I even made extra deposits to check whether the bonus application via Telegram was causing the issue, but the game still wouldn't load at all and It ended up generating the same error again. All other games are accessible except for Fortune Tiger. The real issue is that I can only play it using my balance in order to meet the rollover requirement.</p>
