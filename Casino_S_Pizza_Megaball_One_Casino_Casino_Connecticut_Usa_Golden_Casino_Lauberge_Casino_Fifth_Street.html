    <h1>Casino S Pizza Megaball One Casino Casino Connecticut Usa Golden Casino Lauberge Casino Fifth Street</h1>

<p>Fifth Street Gaming, a Las Vegas-based full-service hospitality and casino management company, has teamed up with the sports bar company Ojos Locos Sports Cantina to launch a US casino hotel that caters to the needs of Latino customers.</p>
<p>Lucky Club Hotel &amp; Casino to Be Renovated</p>
<p>The deal will see the two partners work together to renovate the Lucky Club Hotel &amp; Casino in North Las Vegas. Following the renovation, the property will be rebranded and improved with exclusive Ojos Locos Sports Cantina which will become the main venue for dining, entertainment, and nightlife.</p>
<p>Fifth Street Gaming and Ojos Locos hope that the project will be completed by the end of the year, allowing the renewed venue to launch in 2023. The renovation will affect Lucky Club Hotel &amp; Casino’s dining area, improving its capacity to 300 guests. The casino and the entertainment space, each 10,000-square-feet-large, will be renovated and put into good order.</p>
<p>As the two partners plan the renewed casino as a place oriented toward a Latino audience, they also announced upcoming plans to regularly host live concerts featuring Latino artists, hold food festivals and even organize rodeo events.</p>
<p>The Partners Are Excited to Support the Latino Community</p>
<p>Laura Caudillo, Ojos Locos Sports Cantina’s vice president of marketing, spoke about the new deal, emphasizing her excitement about this project. She said that her company is delighted by the opportunity to work side by side with Fifth Street Gaming and bring the Ojos Locos experience to Nevada. Caudillo also said that she is thrilled by the opportunity to cater to the local Latino community and provide it with supreme service, tasty food, and an engaging atmosphere.</p>
<p>Seth Schorr, Fifth Street Gaming’s chief executive officer, also spoke about the renovation project. He lauded Ojos Locos’ dedication to the Latino community, saying that he is looking forward to working with the brand:</p>
<p>“We are gratified to join together on this endeavor with Ojos Locos, a vibrant and growing brand which has, over the last 12 years, established itself as a national leader in providing authentic hospitality experiences to the Latino community.” Fifth Street Gaming CEO Seth Schorr</p>
<p>Schrorr is convinced that the combination of Fifth Street’s 15-year record of providing events to the Latino community in Sothern Nevada and Ojos Locos’ experience is a recipe for success. He concluded that Ojos Locos is the perfect partner for this “first-ever Latino-focused integrated gaming, dining and entertainment venture.”</p>
<p>This isn’t Fifth Street Gaming’s only recent Latino-oriented initiative. A month ago, the company launched Jefebet.com to cater to the Latino community.</p>
