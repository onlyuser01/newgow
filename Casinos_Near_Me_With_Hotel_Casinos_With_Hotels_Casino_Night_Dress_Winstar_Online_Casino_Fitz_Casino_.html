<p>......... Awesome!........ Wait a second? That withdrawal on the 26th of July was when I was originally suppose to be paid out... That was when I had put in for the withdrawal on the 15th. I waited 11 days only to hear that I needed to resubmit my withdrawal request due to issues with the coindrop. Of all people that should be aware of incident, I feel that Nick should know more about that than anyone else? Anyhoot, I resubmitted my withdrawal request again on the 26th. I was "not" paid out on the 26th, to be clear. In fact, I have received a few emails directly from Prism assuring me that my withdrawal was being processed. These emails were sent on the 29th, 1st of August and finally on the 3rd. The only reason I had received these emails is because I have been rattling the cages with customer service and verifying if any progress has been made. When I contacted customer service on the 2nd of this month, I was told that they no longer had my bitcoin address on file? This was news to me, considering that "they had already processed" the withdrawal... The polite customer service agent kindly offered me the email address for the finance department at which point I emailed them with my bitcoin address plus three other payment solutions (cash app, bank routing and account numbers, paypal). That same day I had a response back from finance claiming that they would have my withdrawal in the processing stage by the following day at the latest (Aug 3rd). Also, I was issued compensation (see attachment)through a custom no deposit code which offered $50, but was told not to input until my pending withdrawal was removed. I thought that was cool on their behalf... Until...., Today. I woke up to see that my pending withdrawal was no longer on my withdrawal page, which had me worried, as if they have had enough of me and discarded it. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and was able to input my code and gamble at least.... That $50 compensation credit was invalid and didnt work... So, i contacted customer service again, to figure out why my code didnt work and to also ask about my withdrawal status. The agent mentioned that i needed to deposit money for the code to work, when there is no such request in the email granting the $50. So that was a bust. As for my withdrawal, I am "suppose" to receive it in another 7-10 days, but I cant help but to be skeptical. If it does go through, that would be nearly 30 days I had to wait for such a simple withdrawal. Thank you Mikal and Veronika along with Casino Guru.</p>
