<p>The prominent company behind B2B and B2C solutions for the online gaming sector, Markor Technology, has expanded its existing game aggregation platform through a new partnership with Skywind, the firm said in a press release shared via email.</p>
<p>Skywind is an award-winning company which has produced more than 300 excellent and industry-defining slot games that will now be integrated into Markor’s content platform, which is touted as one of the best aggregation solutions in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Besides slots, though Skywind will also focus on bringing its entire live casino portfolio to the platform. This includes options such as Live Blackjack, Live Roulette, and not least, Live Baccarat, making sure that there is a good variety of options for Markor clients to choose from.</p>
<p>Markor works with a wide network of operators that are now able to access Skywind titles directly on its aggregation platform and under applicable licenses. Skywind Senior Partner Manager Alina Popa has hailed the opportunity to see Skywind games integrated with the platform and said that the company was thrilled to add to Markor’s growing line-up of games and options.</p>
<p>"As a company that works with a huge number of casino operators in a variety of markets worldwide, teaming up with Markor will allow us to put our games in front of even more new players," Popa explained.</p>
<p>Markor Technology Chief Executive Officer Melissa Summerfield was similarly pleased with the development and said that Skywind was a knowledgeable partner and an important addition to Markor’s portfolio and a great way to expand the aggregation platform a step further.</p>
<p>She thanked Skywind for the opportunity to see the live catalogue of games integrated with the platform, which is now going to be accessible to players worldwide thanks to Markor’s aggregation tech. Aggregation models have been a powerful way for both suppliers and operators to do business.</p>
<p>Many B2B companies such as Markor Technology and Relax Gaming have been more than willing to serve as intermediaries, helping the industry find new ways to bring powerful content to players. Markor Technology has previously stated that the company is now looking to expand in Spain and Ontario, as it plans to continue with its global growth ambitions and plans.</p>
