<p>A Stakelogic representative said that Portuguese players should prepare for the gaming experience of their lives</p>
<p>Stakelogic, a leading developer and supplier of slots, has expanded its presence in Portugal through an agreement with Betclic. The local operator will onboard a number of titles from the provider and grow its footprint in the country.</p>
<p>Under the deal, a number of classic and video slots will be supplied to Betclic. This will include classic titles such as Super Bonus Wild, Runner 8 Runner, Bonus Runner, Super 6 Timer and Mega Runner.</p>
<p>In addition, Stakelogic will supply its new partner with a suite of its best video slots. As a result, Portuguese players will get to experience best-in-class games like Treasures of Ra, Money Track 2, Greedy Fox, Bison Blocks and the upcoming Eric’s Big Catch and Candyways Bonanza 3 Megaways.</p>
<p>Stakelogic is best known for its cutting-edge video slots which sport unique engagement-boosting mechanics that are sure to keep players on the edge of their seats. Its classic games, meanwhile, are designed to appeal to gambling traditionalists and casino newcomers alike.</p>
<p>Stakelogic players can earn extra large prizes thanks to the developer’s Super Stake feature that allows players to double their bet and increase their chance to trigger a bonus. Players can also benefit from the Spin to Win mechanic which combines slot play and live dealer games by taking players to one of two live prize wheels they can spin to win big prizes.</p>
<p>In other news, Stakelogic recently supplied Bally’s Rhode Island business with live casino games.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Bolster Betclic’s Offering</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s senior sales manager, Danila Dzehs, commented on the agreement, warning Portuguese players that they need to „prepare for the online slot experience of their lives.” He noted that his company’s games are all designed to amaze players in unique ways that “other games can only aspire to.”</p>
<p>It’s this turbo-charged gameplay that has seen us become a must-have provider. We are delighted to have added Betclic to our growing roster of partners, and to expand our presence in Portugal via this deal. Danila Dzehs, senior sales manager, Stakelogic</p>
<p>Geoffroy Villiot, Betclic’s head of casino, also shared his thoughts on the arrangement, praising Stakelogic for its “chart-topping titles” and the company’s global presence. Villiot noted that his team absolutely wanted to add Stakelogic titles to its portfolio as this will greatly enhance Betclic’s offering.</p>
<p>This deal brings variety and quality to our lobby, while also providing new online slot experiences via features such as Super Stake and Spin to Win that will enable us to stand out from other brands in the market. Geoffroy Villiot, head of casino, Betclic</p>
<p>Betclic is one of the most influential operators in Portugal. The company recently became the title sponsor of Liga Portugal, the country’s top-flight soccer league.</p>
