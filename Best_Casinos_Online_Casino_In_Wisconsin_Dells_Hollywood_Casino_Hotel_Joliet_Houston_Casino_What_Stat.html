    <h1>Best Casinos Online Casino In Wisconsin Dells Hollywood Casino Hotel Joliet Houston Casino What Stat</h1>

<p>Hello Veronika,</p>
<p>I've been there since the opening or transfer of all German customers, I guess that's about a year now.</p>
<p>A withdrawal has never taken place because I had never reached the sales conditions except now. Now I've done it once and they immediately block the customer account after they've collected all the data for successful verification.</p>
<p>A deposit from me took place on October 31, 2023. I made it with a chip because they delayed the bank transfer of my winnings. So I could also activate Jeton as a withdrawal method, or so I thought. The deposit was 10 euros, which was made without a bonus and was also lost, which wasn't a problem because it was made for me as a conditional legitimation for the jeton account. The payout of the 25 euros on a chip was then rejected again with reference to the bank payout. I have now commissioned this as they requested and instead of paying out they simply block my account. That seems to be the method there when players win something from a no deposit, something I've read more often in forums recently.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can no longer see the activation of the bonus because they have blocked all access to my account for no reason. But it was the beginning of October... Since then I tried to pay out which was repeatedly delayed.</p>
<p>The sales conditions were successfully met on the same day as the bonus was activated.</p>
<p>Yes, the bank account has been successfully verified with all necessary documents.</p>
<p>I hope that we can find a solution here and that such methods do not have any success on the backs of the players... It's only 25 euros but what happened here is simply not legal and that's precisely why I hope that the matter can be clarified together with you can.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
