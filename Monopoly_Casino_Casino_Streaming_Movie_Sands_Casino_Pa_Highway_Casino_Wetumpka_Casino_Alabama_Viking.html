    <h1>Monopoly Casino Casino Streaming Movie Sands Casino Pa Highway Casino Wetumpka Casino Alabama Viking</h1>

<p>Thank you, Seanzzzzz, for your reply. I have checked the general terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<ol>
<li>RESPONSIBLE GAMING/GAMBLING</li>
</ol>
<p>35.1 For those customers who wish to restrict their gambling, we provide a voluntary self-exclusion policy, which enables You to close Your Account or restrict Your ability to place bets or game on the Website for a minimum period of six months. Once Your Account has been self-excluded You will be unable to reactivate the Account under any circumstances until the expiry of the period chosen under this paragraph. At the expiry of the self-exclusion period You will be entitled to re-commence use of the Services by contacting support@vikingbet.io.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings Vikingbet Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@vikingbet.io (you can CC me at petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments.</p>
<p>Please understand that we can't act upon your previous self-exclusion request as you didn't save a copy of your communication.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
