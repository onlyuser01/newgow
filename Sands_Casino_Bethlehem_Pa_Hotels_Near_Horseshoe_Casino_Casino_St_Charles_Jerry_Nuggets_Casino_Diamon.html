<p>The casino and hospitality industry in Atlantic City, New Jersey felt the impact of the pandemic in 2020. Casino resorts were closed back then for more than three months due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). After the venues were allowed to reopen for visitors, various restrictions impacted their revenues. However, despite the challenging 2020, new data reveals that casinos are on the right track and their economic rebound already started in 2021.</p>
<p>AC’s Casinos on the Way to Economic Rebound</p>
<p>Last week Friday, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) released data outlining the fourth quarter and year-end results for casinos in Atlantic City. Overall, the casino operators reported $174.4 million in profits during Q4, 2021. This result marked a significant 201% increase when compared to the $57 million they made during the same period in 2020.</p>
<p>Besides the fourth quarter, the full year 2021 results also looked well, according to DGE’s latest report. In 2021, licensed operators in Atlantic City made $766.8 million. Undoubtedly, this result proved that the market soared during 2021, considering that the casinos’ winnings for 2020 halted at $117.5 million.</p>
<p>What is more, the $766.8 million in winnings overshadowed the industry’s result from 2019, when they made $594 million. Considering the financial results from last year, it is clear that the gaming and hospitality industry in Atlantic City started its economic rebound.</p>
