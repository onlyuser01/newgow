<p>Jacks.nl and its parent company said that motorsport is in their DNA</p>
<p>Formula 1 Heineken Dutch Grand Prix announced that Jacks.nl, a Dutch gambling company, will serve as one of its principal sponsors. From 2024 onwards, the operator will join the list of the Dutch Grand Prix’s partners, which includes major companies such as Pon, Heineken, Radio 538 and Jumbo.</p>
<p>Formula 1 Heineken Dutch Grand Prix’s sporting director, Jan Lammers, praised Jacks.nl as a company “with passion for motorsport.” He said that the two parties share the same values, which is why Jacks.nl is a welcome addition to the Dutch Grand Prix family.</p>
<p>Lammers said that the partnership is set to “add a new dimension” to the experience during the week at Zandvoort.</p>
<p>Jacks.nl Wants to Promote Gaming Responsibly</p>
<p>Jacks.nl representatives also shared their thoughts on the tie-up with Eric Olders, the operator’s board chairman, highlighting his team’s commitment to the racing and sports sectors. According to him, the new partnership suits his company perfectly.</p>
<p>Olders promised that Jacks.nl will work besides the Formula 1 Heineken Dutch Grand Prix to promote the operator’s services in a safe and responsible fashion.</p>
<p>The fantastic combination of the excitement and entertainment at the Dutch Grand Prix is what you see reflected in the gaming experience that we also offer with our services. And then obviously just like in Formula 1 with the right measuring instruments and safety measures to be able to experience that excitement in a controlled way. Eric Olders, chairman, Jacks.nl</p>
<p>Motorsport is in JVH’s Capillaries</p>
<p>Norbert Kout, chief marketing officer at JVH gaming &amp; entertainment, Jacks.nl’s parent company, also commented on the matter. He noted that the group has been active in the motorsport sector for years.</p>
<p>Kout pointed to JACK’s Racing Day on the circuit in Assen as one of the events sponsored by the company, as well as to the media partnership with Ziggo Race Café, which is broadcast around all Grand Prix events. Finally, he noted that his team also sponsors Porsche Carrera Cup Benelux. The CMO concluded that the aforementioned deals highlight JVH’s commitment to motorsports.</p>
<p>Kout concluded: “So car and motorsport is in our capillaries. The big step to the Dutch Grand Prix is actually a logical continuation of what we already do in racing.”</p>
