<p>Deiveson Figueiredo Defending His Title Once Again</p>
<p>Deiveson Figueiredo is 21-2-1 in his professional career as a mixed martial artist. The Brazilian started out in local promotions in South America before signing with the UFC in 2017. Since then, he‚Äôs 10-1-1 in the world‚Äôs most elite fighting organization.</p>
<p>Four of his 10 wins happened in title bouts. The first one took place in February 2020 when Figgy fought (and defeated) Joseph Benavidez in a fight for the vacant UFC Flyweight title. He beat the American by technical knockout.</p>
<p>Benavidez got a chance for a payback a few months later, but Figueiredo beat him again. This time, he did it by submission. The same happened in his second title defense, in which he defeated Alex Perez.</p>

<p>Then, in his final fight of 2020, he fought Brandon Moreno for the first time. After five rounds of intense fighting, the fight has declared a draw (majority). Truth be told, Figueiredo was the better fighter that evening, and the only reason why he didn‚Äôt win was that he got one point deducted due to an illegal move (groin strike).</p>
<p>The second Deiveson Figueiredo vs Brandon Moreno fight was when Figgy finally lost his title ‚Äì The Assassin Baby defeated him by submission in June 2021. Fast-forward to January 2022 and Figueiredo got his revenge. He beat Moreno by unanimous decision in a spectacular bout that was crowned the Fight of the Night by the UFC.</p>
<p>Figueiredo hasn‚Äôt fought a single fight since then, but you can be 100% sure that he‚Äôs been working hard to prepare for the quadrilogy fight this coming Saturday. His fitness levels are reportedly superb, while there really is no need to discuss his skills ‚Äì Figueiredo is one of the most well-rounded fighters in the UFC.</p>
<p>Brandon Moreno‚Äôs Confidence is Sky-High</p>
<p>Unlike Figueiredo who hasn‚Äôt fought in almost exactly one year to date, Moreno (20-6-2) did pay a visit to the octagon last summer. He fought Kai Kara-France at UFC 277, which turned out to be a spectacular fight. The two fought for nearly four rounds before Moreno finally beat his opponent by TKO.</p>
<p>It was only his fourth win by this method; his preferred way of finishing his opponents is submission. Actually, Moreno is one of the best submission artists in the history of the flyweight division. Grappling/wrestling might be his strongest weapon, but this guy also knows how to strike. On top of that, his stamina is fantastic, which could play a key role in Saturday‚Äôs fight.</p>
<p>The road to victory here seems to be to try and tire Figueiredo out. To achieve that, Moreno would need to avoid getting hit by the striking wizard, which won‚Äôt be easy. Still, Moreno is a fighter who doesn‚Äôt mind getting slapped.</p>
<p>Actually, he got dropped a couple of times by Figueiredo in their three fights, but still managed to stay undefeated within the distance. Yep, all six of his career losses happened by decision.</p>
<p>Deiveson Figueiredo vs Brandon Moreno 4 Prediction</p>
<p>It‚Äôs really a coin toss, this fight. Whatever happens, we won‚Äôt be surprised. Although the odds (slightly) favor Moreno, we do think that Figueiredo has it in him to defend his title. And if he‚Äôs going to do it, he might pull it off with a knockout.</p>
<p>Even though Moreno has never been KO-ed, we believe Figueiredo stands a good chance to do it. The guy‚Äôs been pumping iron over the last year ‚Äì which is why he was almost 9 pounds above the flyweight limit before just a week ago ‚Äì with plans of moving to the bantamweight division in the future.</p>
