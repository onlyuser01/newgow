    <h1>Riverfront Casino Pittsburgh Big M Casino Little River Sc Milwaukee Casinos Aliante Casino And Hotel</h1>

<p>The headiness of mass sports and casino gambling legalization is beginning to subside a little, allowing lawmakers to address some of the newly created challenges</p>
<p>This is precisely what Virginia is doing by setting up its Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Advisory Committee, a new body that will be exclusively tasked with addressing gambling-related harm in the state and getting more resources to those in need.</p>
<p>Additional Resources to Fight Problem Gambling in the State</p>
<p>This move is part of Senate Bill 836 and it has already been approved by the legislature, and the governor himself, with Glenn Youngkin giving his go-ahead for the bill and signing it into law. The new body will be taking off on July 1, 2023, and it will seek to provide support across a range of verticals.</p>
<p>All existing forms of gambling will be impacted, including lottery operations, sports betting and casinos, and even charitable gaming. The new initiative will operate under the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and will be looking to address the growing interest in gambling and specifically those cases when consumers are unable to control their spending habits.</p>
<p>Sen. Bryce Reeves who sponsored the deal said that he felt obligated to do something and ensure that young people are protected. He argued that those between the ages of 18 and 25 were gambling on sports already, especially around the time of a major event.</p>
<p>This dramatic increase in the betting activity, argued Reeves, would lead to more cases in which young people are struggling with how much they spend on gambling in the first place. The Virginia Problem Gambling Hotline has already been experiencing an increased intake of calls with the numbers more than doubling in the past several years alone.</p>
<p>Some Worrying Statistics to Tackle in Virginia</p>
<p>There have been other red-flag research to speak of, including the fact that many high schoolers, around a quarter, admit to having placed a bet, although this could be illegal depending on the age of the student. The arrival of the Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Advisory Committee should help start to address these issues. Meanwhile, there has been a determined push on a national level to advertise safer and responsible gambling practices, with stakeholders acknowledging the need to work on ensuring that consumers are aware of the best way to bet and gamble responsibly.</p>
