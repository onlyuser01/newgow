<p>Sports fans are not happy with the way their favorite football clubs are teaming up with gambling companies. And yet, commercial considerations and falling margins have forced many clubs, including some of those in the Premier League, to consider teaming up with gambling firms after all. The latest is AFC Bournemouth which partnered up with global sports betting platform Dafabet.</p>
<p>At a time when legislators are preparing to address the proliferation of gambling advertisements in sports, Dafabet is doubling down on its commitment and presence. The partnership will cover the next two seasons and will feature the betting brand’s logo on the front of player shirts.</p>
<p>AFC Bournemouth won promotion over the last season and will once again play in Premier League in 2022/23. Dafabet will also become involved with the club on another level by offering funds to good causes. One of those is a donation to the Community Sports Trust which is helping adults get back to work.</p>
<p>Bournemouth Commercial Director Rob Mitchell addressed the partnership welcoming the opportunity while being upfront about the club’s motivation. "Dafabet is important in providing [the club] with crucial revenue," Mitchell said. Understandably, entering the Premier League comes with its own unique challenges, one of which is mustering a sufficient war chest to ensure that you can actually buy the players you need to perform well, or even stay in the Premier League.</p>
<p>The upside is that clubs generally win more as part of the Premier League as opposed to any second-tier competition. Mitchell feels confident about the upcoming partnership, citing Dafabet’s extensive track record in working with multiple sports teams and across different competitions.</p>
<p>The brand’s global reach is an opportunity for AFC Bournemouth to strike home with new crowds from across the world. Dafabet has indeed worked with numerous companies over the years, including football clubs such as Aston Villa, Fulham, Burnley, and Celtic to name a few.</p>
<p>Dafabet Head of Sponsorships John Cruces welcomed the opportunity and said that the sportsbook was happy to be working with AFC Bournemouth. Cruces praised the high profile the Premier League has achieved over the years. The executive doubled down on his commitment to the Community Sports Trust and said that Dafabet will be contributing.</p>
<p>The partnership comes at an important point for regulated gambling in the United Kingdom. As a new draft of the White Paper revising the Gambling Act of 2005 is expected, sports fans are beginning to push back against commercial partnerships with betting companies even if it’s a matter of survival.</p>
<p>A fan-backed Everton FC petition recently collected more than 20,000 signatures in which club supporters asked the club to sever ties with an online gambling company the team recently partnered up with.</p>
