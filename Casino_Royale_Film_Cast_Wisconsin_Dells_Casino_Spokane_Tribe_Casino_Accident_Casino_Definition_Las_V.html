<p>Leading sports betting and gaming brand Betway has announced it has become Hamburg European Open’s official sponsor in 2022. The partnership is an expansion of the “fantastic relationship” that Betway was already enjoying with the popular tennis tournament.</p>
<p>Betway Is Eager to Make History</p>
<p>Betway’s chief executive officer Anthony Workman spoke on behalf of the company, expressing content regarding the expansion of its relationship with the Am Rothenbaum-based tennis event. However, this year’s competition which will spread across nine days between July 16 and July 24 will bring something new to the year-old partnership. Namely, Betway is determined to write its own piece of history while partnering and offering its support to a mixed tournament for both men and women.</p>
<p>Workman expressed the company’s views regarding the importance of women’s tennis and the need for it to receive more support in order to grow globally.</p>
<p>Who Will Play at the Hamburg European Open?</p>
<p>Accordingly, this year, the Hamburg European Open will bring together a series of high-profile as well as fresh and promising tennis players, including Holger Rune from Denmark, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina representing Spain, and Germany’s Andrea Eprkovic who is also the tournament ambassador. Danielle Collins, the American tennis player who soared into Top 10 after reaching the final at the Australian Open will also be attending this year’s tournament.</p>
<p>Hamburg European Open’s director Sandra Reichel expressed her delight regarding the expansion of its partnership with Betway that was initiated in 2021 during “unusual times” in the context of the global pandemic. Reichel also commented on their multi-year deal and the currently expanded commitment related to the mixed event that will reunite both male and female players. A combined tennis event was last held almost four and a half decades ago in Hamburg. Betway will assist the tournament with its solid policy that promotes safe and inclusive environments for all customers.</p>
<p>Last September, Betway was named the official sponsor of the ATP TOUR European Open Event that took place at the end of October. The event brought the operator-wide brand exposure at a digital level. In March 2021, Betway also became Miami Open’s sponsor and improved its courtside exposure at the popular Hard Rock Stadium. Madrid Open, the David Cup, and Tie Break Tens are additional tennis tournaments and events part of the operator’s impressive portfolio of sponsorships.</p>
<p>Last June, Betway signed sponsorship agreements with two other German tennis tournaments, the Mercedes Cup held in Stuttgart, and the Noventi Open held in Hamburg.</p>
