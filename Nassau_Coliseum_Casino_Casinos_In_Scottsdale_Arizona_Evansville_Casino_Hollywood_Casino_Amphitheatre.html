    <h1>Nassau Coliseum Casino Casinos In Scottsdale Arizona Evansville Casino Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre</h1>

<p>The leading supplier of high-performing slot, table and interactive products and services for the global gambling industry has made a new important appointment</p>
<p>Robert Ziems, who is a long-term veteran, is stepping into the position of chief legal officer with immediate effect and will leverage his extensive industry knowledge and expertise. He has more than 24 years of experience as part of some of the biggest companies in the sector, and will now help AGS pivot its legal and compliance efforts in Latin America.</p>
<p>Seasoned Veteran to Bolster PlayAGS’ Growth Plans</p>
<p>He will also help AGS’ interactive business strategy and support it in the long term. Ziems is joining the company from Aruze Gaming where he served as a global chief legal officer, and where he spent 12 years in various positions.</p>
<p>Ziems experience in Aruze has helped the company reach new markets, capitalize on existing technology, and leverage new business development across the Americas. Commenting on his appointment as part of AGS, company president and CEO David Lopez said:</p>
<p>Rob is a great addition to our leadership team as we diversify AGS’ portfolio and advance our business strategy. AGS CEO David Lopez</p>
<p>Lopez added that Ziems’ deep knowledge of the gaming industry and its regulatory prerequisites would enable the entire company to benefit and move forward across key performance verticals.</p>
<p>Ziems’ experience as a professional doesn’t stop at Aruze, however. He similarly spent a stint as EVP and general counsel, and corporate secretary at Mikohn Gaming. There, he was in charge of human resources, internal audit departments, and more. He has held stints with Station Casino, Aristocrat Technologies, and others.</p>
<p>The newly-appointed chief legal officer is replacing the current one, Victor Gallo, who is retiring from AGS after 12 years on the job. Gallo will remain secretary for the company, however. Lopez hailed Gallo’s stint with the company and said that he played key roles in important company development such as its initial public offering back in 2018 and the acquisition of Cadillac Jack, among others.</p>
