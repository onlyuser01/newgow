<p>Gibraltar-based online sports betting and iGaming company Mansion Group announced its MansionCasino brand successfully launched operations in Spain, while the group’s other brands are expected to become available in the country in the future.</p>
<p>Launch in Spain</p>
<p>The launch of Mansion Group’s online casino brand MansionCasino took place after the brand received an operating license from Spain’s gambling regulator, the Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego (DGOJ), in July this year.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to introduce our MansionCasino brand in Spain and continue to provide award-winning customer support with a dedicated Spanish customer support team based in our new Spanish office.” David Murphy, CMO, Mansion Group</p>
<p>MansionCasino “has something for every player,” offering hundreds of casino games, including slots, jackpot and classic table games, as well as a Live Casino. The brand will have its dedicated customer support team operating out of the group’s new office in Cadiz that currently is home to a team of 42.</p>
<p>This, along with our heritage and expertise, will allow us to deliver a best-in-class experience for players in a safe environment while growing our casino brand within the market.” David Murphy, CMO, Mansion Group</p>
<p>The launch of MansionCasino marks the first step of the group’s strategy to establish a presence in Spain as part of its group-wide strategy to expand into regulated gaming jurisdictions in Europe. The group intends to affirm its presence in the Iberian country by introducing the other brands from its portfolio, Casino.com, Slot Heaven and MansionBet, in the future.</p>
<p>UK Presence</p>
<p>MansionBet, the sports betting brand of the Gibraltar-based group, continued to affirm its presence in UK sports after recently implemented changes to the format of the All-Weather Championship by Arena Racing Company (ARC) added the brand as a sponsor of the races throughout the ninth season alongside ARC’s long-standing partner, Super Group-owned Betway.</p>
<p>Mansion Group featured heavily in English soccer in the past: its first high-profile sponsorship deal dates back to 2006 when the group signed a 4-year deal with English Premier League (EPL) Tottenham Hotspur. The group also became the official sponsor of AFC Bournemouth since its promotion to the EPL in 2015. In the same year, Mansion Group also inked a sponsorship deal with Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>Most recently, MansionBet signed with English Football League (EFL) Championship Millwall FC for the 2020-21 season to add the Lions to its other EFL club sponsorship partner Bristol City.</p>
