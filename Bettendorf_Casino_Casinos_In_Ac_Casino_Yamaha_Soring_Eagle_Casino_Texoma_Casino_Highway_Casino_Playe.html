    <h1>Bettendorf Casino Casinos In Ac Casino Yamaha Soring Eagle Casino Texoma Casino Highway Casino Playe</h1>

<p>Yes when i first started playing at highway casino i played with the welcome bonus ontop of my deposit which at the time was like $425 dollars and played all the wagering and brought my highway casino account down to $0.12 cents then I deposited $115 dollars one time then a $83 dollar deposit and 2 are 3 times i sent $30 dollars of bitcoin to my highway casino account but i never accepted another bonus are s promotion from the casino because I didn’t want to have to play with all the wagering so i just played with the money I deposited no bonus and while playing on cash bandit the first game i hit all 5 of the bonus symbols and got a bunch of free spins because i opened almost all the safes and at the end of the bonus round i hit $3100 and after dealing with highway casinos Kyc department for two weeks they finally sent me an email to tell me all my stuff was clarified and i could request a withdrawal from any of their cash out method’s because I deposited money in my account and with my debit and cryto wallet and sent them all the documents to be able to cash out either way and after being okayed to beable to request a withdrawal I requested a withdrawal of $2000 their max cash out limit and after requesting a withdrawal and waiting 5 business days I received an email from highway casino finance department saying my withdrawal request was denied because i was betting $12.50 at the time i had hit and that broke their terms and i got all the screenshots of my conversation with the casino and every deposit and screenshots from the time i hit and you can see it the screenshots i was not betting $12.50 i was betting a$1.50 and hit $3100 at the time and now their not wanting to pay what i rightfully won with the funds I deposited not with any promotions because I didn’t want to have any issues for if i was to hit I didn’t want to play x44 wagering of my deposit and the wagering i did have from my welcome bonus i played it all and was a thousand something dollars to the good when I submitted my first withdrawal which i ended up not withdrawing because initially it took to long and i played my account down to that $0.12 cents and then after my account was at $0.12 cents I deposited a few hunder buck all together and didn’t except any bonus and i just played off my deposits i made after trying and failing the first time to cash out I didn’t want to have to deal with that wagering again the 2nd time and i hit and now they dont want to pay me and i got so many screenshots It probably wont let me up load all of them on here of all the conversations and deposited and all the times i hit and what i was betting at the time for evidence and proof to prove my side</p>
