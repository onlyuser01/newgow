    <h1>Treasure Island Resort Casino Welch Mn Map Of Casinos In Las Vegas Directions To The Hard Rock Casin</h1>

<p>Global gaming and entertainment operator that has a presence in multiple markets such as Europe, the US and Australia, Kindred Group, released its combined Annual and Sustainability Report for the 2022 financial year. The company announced the release of the report Wednesday, highlighting key value-creation drivers as well as its long-term sustainability strategy.</p>
<p>The new report included case studies, facts and figures and reaffirmed Kindred’s commitment to sustainable growth via an effective strategy. The release of the whitepaper outlines the company’s long-term ambition to achieve zero percent gross winnings from problem gambling. With this initiative, Kindred leads by example.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company remains committed to supporting the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) which seeks to reduce the negative impact on climate. Kindred also engages in new partnerships and helps boost local communities, which is part of its ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion plan.</p>
<p>The Company Remains on the Path to Sustainability</p>
<p>In its new report, Kindred noted that it continues to follow its sustainability strategy that ultimately seeks to help the company achieve commercial success responsibly. The company highlighted its sustainability framework, saying that it “offers a constant and clear connection to our commercial strategy.”</p>
<p>The sustainability framework consists of four main elements. Those are responsible gambling, a secure platform, product integrity and responsible business. By combining those elements Kindred seeks to develop meaningful and long-lasting relationships with communities, colleagues and partners that are “based on trust and respect.”</p>
<p>“We chose a path over ten years ago to operate in locally licensed markets giving us access to local markets and providing increased stability.“ Henrik Tjärnström, CEO of Kindred</p>
<p>Henrik Tjärnström, Kindred’s CEO, explained that a decade ago, the company decided to operate within local markets that stand out with increased stability. He pointed out that for the fourth quarter of 2022, 81% of the company’s revenue was derived from locally regulated markets.</p>
<p>“While 2022 has been a challenging year, I am proud and grateful for the hard work put in by all my colleagues at Kindred and at Relax Gaming,“ added Tjärnström</p>
<p>Tjärnström acknowledged that last year was challenging. Still, he said that he is proud of the efforts of the dedicated experts at Kindred and Relax Gaming. Finally, Kindred’s CEO said that the company has ambitious targets set and confirmed that it will continue to execute its growth strategy.</p>
