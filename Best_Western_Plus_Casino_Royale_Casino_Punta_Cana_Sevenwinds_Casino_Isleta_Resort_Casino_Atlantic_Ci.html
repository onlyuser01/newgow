<p>Flows, an innovation platform that ingests data from any source or integration, reinforced its team with yet another former Gaming Innovation Group employee. The one joining Flows this time is the experienced marketing specialist Rhea Craib.</p>
<p>Flows Hired a New Head of Marketing</p>
<p>Craib will be joining Flows as the companyâ€™s new head of marketing. She has over a decade of experience as a marketing officer and will help the company promote its offerings. Therefore, her expertise will be crucial to growing Flows and establishing it as a powerhouse in the sector.</p>
<p>As part of Flows, Craib will work from the companyâ€™s office in Marbella, Spain. This will make things easier for the new appointee as her previous job was also based in the Spanish resort city.</p>
<p>Craib shared her thoughts about joining Flows on LinkedIn. Notably, she said that she is very happy to join a team as talented as Flowsâ€™. She hopes to get to know the companyâ€™s employees and meet new and old faces. The appointee concluded that this is an exciting time for her career.</p>
<p>Super excited to join the amazingly talented team at Flows as Head of Marketing from today. Looking forward to reconnecting and working with some familiar faces ðŸ˜‰ and meeting some new ones. Exciting times aheadâ€¦ Rhea Craib, head of marketing, Flows</p>
<p>Craib Brings In Over a Decade of Experience</p>
<p>Craib previously worked as the group marketing manager of Gaming Innovation Group. She joined the companyâ€™s Marbella office in 2019 and had served the firm up until this month. However, this isnâ€™t the full extent of Craibâ€™s experience.</p>
<p>Prior to joining GiG, she served as the head of marketing for B21 Limited, a crypto-oriented fintech company based in Gibraltar. Earlier, Craib had a short stint as the marketing content manager of WaveCrest Group, which followed a two-year tenure as the head of marketing at Manifesto Design.</p>
<p>Before that, Craib served as a marketing worker at several other companies, including Dragonheart Film Productions, Madvert Group Limited, Shaw Marketing Services and Johnstons of Elgin.</p>
<p>Flows Fields Several Former GiG Employees</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Craib is not the first former GiG employee that Flows has picked up. It should be noted that the innovative company was founded by Robin Reed, a former chief executive officer of GiG. As such, the firm is aware of the amazing talent GiG has and is looking to benefit from that by grabbing some of its most capable employees. As part of the company, the Craib will be joining other ex-members of GiG, including Reed and GiGâ€™s former sales director, James King.</p>
<p>Flows recently became a partner of MaximBet as the latter continues to seek innovation and automation.</p>
