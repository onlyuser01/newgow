<p>Interwetten, an online sports betting and casino company, has expanded its presence in Europe by signing a multi-year deal with the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) Europe. The partnership will see the former company as the sponsor of the European Darts Tour for Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>Interwetten Goes Darts</p>
<p>The partnership between Interwetten and PDC Europe aims to bring darts to a wider audience across Europe. The deal will see the operator launch a new fan-oriented initiative that promotes darts under the slogan “one evening, eight friends and zero costs.”</p>
<p>As the sponsor of the European Darts Tour, Interwetten will foray into the quickly-growing professional darts scene. The partnership will see the operator support the events of the European Darts Tour in Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>Darts is experiencing unprecedented growth in Europe. According to the PDC, the 2022 PDC World Championship finals had 1.5 million viewers on Sky Sports in the United Kingdom alone – a number that is not that far behind the viewership of other professional sporting events.</p>
<p>The PDC Is Delighted by the Deal</p>
<p>Werner von Moltke, the chief executive of the Professional Darts Corporation Europe, is delighted by the partnership with the operator. According to him, there aren’t many companies on quite the same level of competency and motivation as Interwetten. Von Moltke emphasized that he knows the gambling brand is committed to excellence and is convinced it will work to make professional darts even more exciting.</p>
<p>“I know that Interwetten not only wants to present itself as a sponsor but will also make sure that our events will become even more attractive and that the exchange with our fans will be intensified. Therefore, I am very much looking forward to the cooperation and thank them for their trust in us.”</p>
<p>Interwetten’s chief executive officer, Stefan Sulzbacher, pointed out that darts is enjoying increasing popularity in both Germany and Austria – two key markets for his company. He added that the whole Interwetten team is proud to work together with the PDC.</p>
<p>“This will allow us to offer our customers an even larger portfolio of entertainment and we can also set new accents in the development of new markets,” Sulzbacher said.</p>
<p>Interwetten has been steadily promoting its brand through various new sponsorship deals with some of the most influential sports leagues. The company was recently added to the ever-growing roster of international partners of the National Hockey League – a move that made Interwetten NHL’s official partner in Germany and Austria.</p>
