    <h1>Casinos In Md Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Photos Casino In Pendleton Oregon Las Vegas Casinos</h1>

<p>Problem gambling can have a devastating effect on the lives of people that are addicted to the activity. But even if there’s no at-risk or problem gambling at hand, gambling can result in the accumulation of large debt.</p>
<p>Now, a new report suggests that a former National Football League (NFL) star, may be facing a lawsuit over a gambling debt. As reported by TMZ, a lawsuit threatens Kroy Biermann, a famous TV personality and former NFL professional player, over unpaid gambling debt that is related to a trip to the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Reportedly the player is being sued by Sky Warrior, a company that is in charge of credits for the premium casino and entertainment destination Baha Mar Casino in the Bahamas. Citing lawsuit documents, the new report suggests that Biermann secured a $100,000 credit for the Baha Mar Casino. The lawsuit alleges that he spent some $52,500 out of that total to gambling at the casino resort during a trip dating back to 2021.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, Sky Warrior claims that the ex-NFL star promised to pay back the money he spent gambling and said that it will be returned via his SunTrust bank account. However, the company claims, Biermann used $52,500 from the credit for chips but didn’t return the amount before leaving.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also claims that Sky Warrior tried to obtain the money back from Biermann’s bank account but was unable to. Besides the aforementioned amount, allegedly owned by the TV personality and former NFL star, the company is reportedly seeking to recover attorney’s fees, as well as interest.</p>
<p>After playing college football in Montana, Biermann was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons. That happened during the 2008 NFL Draft and he was selected by the Falcons in the fifth round. After finishing the 2015 season with the Atlanta Falcons, in August 2016, he signed a one-year deal with the Buffalo Bills. However, after final roster cuts, in September of the same year, he was released from the Bills.</p>
