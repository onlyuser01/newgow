<p>Online sports betting operator MansionBet announced its partnership with champion jockey Hayley Turner OBE has been extended for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>“We’re all delighted to have Hayley on board for another year.” Dana Bocker, Head of Integrated Marketing, Mansion</p>
<p>Maintain Horse Race Market Position</p>
<p>The renewed partnership between the online sportsbook and one of the most successful female jockeys of all time is aimed at re-affirming the operator’s strong position in the horse racing market.</p>
<p>“Having such a big name within racing has contributed to the success of our campaigns over the past year. We look forward to collaborating on a number of exciting projects as well as watching Hayley win more trophies!” Dana Bocker, Head of Integrated Marketing, Mansion</p>
<p>Hayley Turner, winner of Triple Group One races, including the July Cup and Nunthorpe Stakes, as well as 100 victories in one calendar year achieved in 2008, collaborated with MansionBet in 2020 on several campaigns including Cheltenham and Royal Ascot, where the talented jockey registered her second record-breaking win in the Sandringham Stakes.</p>
<p>“I am absolutely delighted to once again be an ambassador for MansionBet for the upcoming season.” Hayley Turner OBE</p>
<p>The cooperation between the jockey and the sportsbook will continue throughout the upcoming 2021 race season, including on MansionBet’s sponsored race days.</p>
<p>“I had some great days last season wearing the MansionBet breeches, including at Royal Ascot on Onassis in June. Fingers crossed there will be plenty more days like that in 2021!” Hayley Turner OBE</p>
<p>Significant Star Presence</p>
<p>The partnership renewal with Hayley Turner followed the appointment of champion jump jockey Brian Hughes as the new MansionBet’s horse racing ambassador. Hughes and Turner would collaborate in close work with the operator, to produce engaging content for the campaigns of the sportsbook. The champion jump jockey would also feature regularly on the MansionBet blog.</p>
<p>MansionBet’s efforts to maintain its strong position on the horse racing scene began in January, when the sports betting brand of Mansion Group extended its sponsorship deal with Arena Racing Company (ARC) and Jockey Club Racecourses (JCR), as part of its effort to support British horse racing.</p>
<p>The decision to continue to support the industry came despite the unprecedented year in which horse races were suspended mid-March until the end of April, following the response from the British Horseracing Authority (BHA to the coronavirus outbreak which shut down race courses.</p>
