<p>GG.Bet, the Ukrainian esports betting brand, is all systems go in the United Kingdom after Rednines Gaming Ltd. Received the rights to use the GG.Bet brand name in the country and unfold one of the world’s leading esports betting platforms locally. Rednines is rebranding the Dr. Bet platform to ggbet.co.uk with the company saving all existing customer accounts and balances as part of the transfer.</p>
<p>Moving forward, GG.Bet will bring a variety of new opportunities to local players, offering esports and sports fans, as well as casino players, a chance to experience the best products in each respective vertical. Although GG.Bet made a name for itself as one of the world’s leading esports wagering platforms, the brand has quickly established itself in all other relevant segments of the industry as well.</p>
<p>GG.BET UK CEO Sergii Mishchenko welcomed the news on a high note, arguing that the GG.Bet franchise is one of lasting presencein the esports betting market, and not only. The UK betting market is a competitive and lucrative opportunity for the operator and the company will no go head-to-head with other strong players, Mishchenko explained.</p>
<p>"We’re delighted to become a part of a global brand and are looking forward to contributing to the esports betting market in the UK," he assured outlining the months and years ahead. GG.Bet arrives on the market at the right time as the esports betting market is thriving, although the exact numbers are a little sparse.</p>
<p>One estimate suggests that demand for esports betting has increased by nearly fifty per cent in the past several years in the United Kingdom, meaning that the market is ripe for the taking by prominent brands such as GG.Bet. In the meantime, GG.Bet has been strongly committed to forging its reputation in the sector, partnering, and sponsoring some of the most prominent esports organizations, including Team Vitality and Na’Vi, the Ukrainian home team.</p>
<p>GG.Bet recently joined ESIC to bolster the latter organization’s efforts in fighting match-fixing and corruption in esports. The two companies are collaborating on various integrity initiatives over the next three years with GG.Bet helping ESIC detect potential match-fixing offenses in esports.</p>
<p>Although a fairly young discipline, esports and esports betting are already attracting their fair share of corruption, albeit not on par with mainstream sports. Regardless, IBIA’s latest reports have featured at least one instance of match-fixing offenses over the past quarters.</p>
