<p>Casino and hotel properties by Wind Creek reopen in Alabama. The venues will operate following strict social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols.</p>
<p>Wind Creek Casino and Hotel Properties in Alabama Reopen</p>
<p>Casino and hotel properties in Alabama by Wind Creek Hospitality reopen today. Announced near the end of May, the company set a planned date of June 8 to reopen all three properties in Alabama. The properties in Montgomery, Atmore and Wetumpka are managed and owned by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. This is actually the only federally recognized tribe of Native Americans in the Alabama State.</p>
<p>Wind Creek’s properties were not forced to close doors but rather made their own choice back in min-March. This action was aiming to help the state fight the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Now, nearly three months later, the properties resume operations but at limited capacity and enhanced health and safety policies.</p>
<p>The Venues Will Operate Under Enhanced Cleaning Protocols and Social Distancing</p>
<p>Part of the new health and safety policies is temperature checks for all visitors and employees. Face protection such as masks or face shields must be worn by everyone. Visitors are urged to bring their own face masks. In case they don’t have it, they can receive it in exchange for a small donation towards local first responders.</p>
<p>In order to ensure social distancing, the properties will have limited number of guests – only one-third of the normal capacity. The properties will also offer increased distancing between the gaming tables, hotel check-ins and other services. Furthermore, the working hours of each casino will be separated in four sessions. Deep sanitation will be conducted between each session. Each gaming machine is also going to be cleaned before and after every visitor. Last but not least, smoking will only be allowed in specially designated areas which are separate from the restaurants and gaming areas.</p>
<p>Property of Wind Creek in Pennsylvania Remains Closed</p>
<p>Although Wind Creek’s casinos in Alabama are ready for visitors, this is not the case with the company’s property in Pennsylvania. It is still unknown when the Wind Creek property in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania can resume operations. The property itself was acquired by Wind Creek last year from Las Vegas Sands following a deal of some $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>Last week, Pennsylvania casinos were allowed to resume operations as of June 9. This was in line with the green phase of the reopening plan by Governor Tom Wolf. Despite that casinos were allowed to reopen as of tomorrow, only two casino operators have announced reopening dates.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the United States, casinos in Ohio are preparing to reopen as of June 19. On the other hand, the casino industry in Las Vegas was already restarted as of last week. Keeping in mind the post-COVID-19 measures applicable for all venues around the globe, one can honestly say that casinos will look differently, at least in the near future.</p>
