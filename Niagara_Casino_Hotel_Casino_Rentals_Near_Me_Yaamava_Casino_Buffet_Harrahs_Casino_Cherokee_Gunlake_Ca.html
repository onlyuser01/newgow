<p>Money Train 3 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Money Train 3 takes the much-loved franchise into a new sci-fi world.</p>
<p>Trading in the Western landscape, players will find themselves surrounded by advanced machines and cyberpunk characters. The titular train now looks far more like a vehicle for space travel fueled by a glowing blue liquid.</p>
<p>This slot is a good find for players who love the original Money Train slot, but feel ready to explore a futuristic setting.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack features mournful string notes that evoke a Western vibe with a steady beat that brings to mind the steady rumble of a train.</p>
<p>An opening animation sequence showcases one of the cyberpunk characters loading a weapon and firing it with a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will spot bandits wearing intimidating gas masks as well as an enigmatic heroine with blue hair and face paint. A wise bearded man in a cowboy hat gives a nod to the original Money Train slots while his sci-fi monocle suggests he’s part of quite a different world.</p>
<p>Card suits also appear among the symbols, glowing in shades of blue, green, red, and gold.</p>
<p>The reels are built into a metallic train car, with a skull adorning the front of the engine. The track is made of glossy metal that matches the train itself. Beyond the reels, a mysterious room filled with buttons and panels can be seen.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation create a dystopian future infused with western flavor.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Money Train 3 is a five-reel, four-row slot, with 40 win lines.</p>
<p>The gameplay is swift and engaging, ensuring players will have no difficulty paying attention.</p>
<p>If they wish, players can buy into any of the bonus features (see further details below).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all paying symbols.</p>
<p>The Respin feature can be triggered randomly on any spin where there is no winning combination. During this feature, a symbol appearing currently on the reels will be chosen at random to be sticky for the round. Players are then awarded 1 respin and if any of the special sticky symbols land again, another respin is awarded.</p>
<p>All standard paying symbols are replaced with over a dozen of special symbols in the Money Cart Bonus round</p>
<p>During the Respin feature, players can also land multiplier symbols with values ranging from 1x to 3x the player’s bet.</p>
<p>The Money Cart Bonus is triggered when players land 3 or more Bonus symbols which then become sticky and show a value. Then, players begin with 3 respins. Persistent Gold symbols can also trigger the Money Cart Bonus.</p>
<p>Highly volatile version of the Money Cart Bonus round with 1 Persistent Symbol</p>
<p>During the Money Cart Bonus, players can land paying symbols that have associated multipliers between 1x and 10x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>A variety of special symbols may also appear during the bonus, including the Collector, which gathers the values from other symbols on the reels to itself. There is also a special Sniper symbol that has the special property of doubling bonus symbol values, and an Absorber symbol that takes any regular bonus symbols off the reels.</p>
