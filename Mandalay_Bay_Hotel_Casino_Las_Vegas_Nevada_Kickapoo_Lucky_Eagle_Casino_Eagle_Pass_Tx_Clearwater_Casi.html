    <h1>Mandalay Bay Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nevada Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino Eagle Pass Tx Clearwater Casi</h1>

<p>Hello Kristina,</p>
<p>For the first time, my payment was canceled several times. The reasons were always stored as "Incorrect payment details".</p>
<p>Now it finally worked to request a payout.</p>
<p>Yes, the casino sent me an email from a KYC email address (kyc@weltbet.com). The email says I should respond to them with the appropriate documents.</p>
<p>I then complied and got an answer from the Gmail Automailer that the mailbox from kyc@weltbet.com was full.</p>
<p>I sent all the documents to support@weltbet.com yesterday and am waiting for a response.</p>
<p>In addition, I find the required documents for verification very excessive and a lot.</p>
<p>quoted from the email here:</p>
<p>"1. A Bank account statement issued from your bank containing the following information:</p>
<p>a. Bank details (name of bank, bank address, SWIFT/BIC code of the bank);</p>
<p>b. customer details (names, address);</p>
<p>c. Account details (IBAN: <strong>DExxxx6314</strong>, currency);</p>
<p>i.e. Date of issue (should be issued in the last 90 days).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Color pictures of the back and front of your card, ending in <strong><em>3840</em>*, having the first six and last four digits clearly visible. </strong>Please cover the rest of the digits and the CVC code on the back with a piece of paper, as this is sensitive information that we do not require.**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bank statement or transaction list, displaying the deposits made to us from <strong>14/01/2023</strong> to <strong>20/03/2023</strong> and color pictures of the back and front of your cards used for the transactions , having the first six and last four digits clearly visible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order for the documents to be acceptable, please ensure that they are readable and all 4 edges of the document are fully visible."</p>
<p>Weltbet would like here ALL bank statements from all periods in which I have ever deposited.</p>
<p>For what reason?</p>
<p>It seems like a waste of time to me that WeltBet is hoping I'd still gamble away my payout amount.</p>
<p>Unnecessarily complicated effort.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your effort.</p>
<p>I hope we manage to get my payout amount.</p>
