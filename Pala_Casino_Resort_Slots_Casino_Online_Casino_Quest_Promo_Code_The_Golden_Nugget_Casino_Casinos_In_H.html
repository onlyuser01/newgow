    <h1>Pala Casino Resort Slots Casino Online Casino Quest Promo Code The Golden Nugget Casino Casinos In H</h1>

<p>Dear petemichael1401,</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. I sincerely apologize for the issues you've encountered. It's important to note that a UKGC license is specifically required for casinos targeting the UK market. If a casino doesn't actively cater to the UK market by offering GBP currency, UK-specific bonuses, etc., they can still accept UK players, but they won't be protected by the UKGC.</p>
<p>To illustrate our standpoint, consider this analogy:</p>
<p>In the UK, people drive on the left side of the road because it's the law. In my country, people drive on the right side. However, we don't build special roads for UK citizens just because their laws dictate left-side driving.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the UKGC license. If you operate in the UK market, you must adhere to UK law. Conversely, if you choose to play in a Curaçao-licensed casino voluntarily, you're subject to Curaçao laws.</p>
<p>Regrettably, in this situation, we're unable to assist, and a refund for your deposits is not applicable. I recommend conducting thorough research in the future and playing only in casinos licensed by the UKGC.</p>
<p>You can explore our list of recommended casinos for UK players here. When selecting one, be sure to use all relevant filters.</p>
<p>To sum it up, I'd like to inform you that we accept the situation when the casino allows players from restricted countries to open an account as long as they don’t use this as an opportunity to later cancel the player’s legitimate winnings. Simply said – if the casino allows players from restricted countries to deposit and play, they should pay out their winnings as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to emphasize, that we investigate further and help only those players, whose funds (or winnings) have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country.</p>
<p>Please understand that we are not an agency with the authority to dictate refund policies to casinos operating without the appropriate license in players' countries of residence.</p>
<p>I wish I could offer more assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
