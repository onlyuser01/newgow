<p>Sports broadcasters are upping their game ahead of the new NFL season and sports channel ESPN is no different. It has announced a slate of new programs and more original sports betting content.</p>
<p>More Quality Content Across All ESPN Platforms</p>
<p>ESPN continues to evolve its digital presence with a new digital show that will be also aired as a podcast. It will be hosted by ESPN’s own sports wagering analyst Doug Kezirian, who will be adding the new show to his slate of ESPN contributions after re-signing his ESPN agreement and adding multiple years to it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Snapchat will be used as the platform for a new weekly sports betting show called Bet with Erin Dolan. Naturally, Erin Dolan will be the host, who will take on the show in addition to her current regular collaboration with Daily Wager, Bet, SportsCenter, This Just In and Monday Tailgate.</p>
<p>Ahead of the start of the football season, ESPN’s popular regular shows Daily Wager and Bet will be aired more often with five slots and three slots per week respectively.</p>
<p>ESPN’s radio channel is also getting a brand-new sports betting show hosted by Anita Marks, who is already quite successful with ESPN New York radio’s The Anita Marks Show. The new show will be aired in the evening on a weekly basis on ESPN Radio Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The new developments in ESPN have not passed the written word. David Purdum, ESPN’s prominent sports wagering reporter, will be adding new content to his current column Notable Bets. His new responsibilities will include longer-form articles that will have sports betting as a major topic.</p>
<p>Three other columns will be also developed. ESPN’s newest team addition, fantasy sports expert Liz Loza, will be starting a column, which will be a mix of sports wagering and fantasy football.</p>
<p>A segment on winners from the show SportsCenter with Scott Van Pelt will also be transformed into a weekly column coming out every Friday.</p>
<p>Additionally, SportCenter’s ‘Stanford’ Steve Coughlin and Chris ‘The Bear’ Fallica will take turns to write a column with their sports betting picks for the week. They will also return to producing their podcast Stanford Steve &amp; The Bear.</p>
<p>Many Favorite ESPN Personalities Get Additional Roles</p>
<p>ESPN old-timer Doug Kezirian will considerably expand his content portfolio across ESPN platforms. In addition to the show Daily Wager, he will be adding radio appearances and writing to his responsibilities. He will be on the radio mainly on weekends discussing college football and the upcoming NFL season. He will also contribute with a variety of columns focusing on sports betting football tips with content coming out throughout the whole week.</p>
<p>Due to Kezirian’s wide range of new responsibilities, Tyler Fulghum will become the new host on Daily Wager with Kezirian maintaining regular appearances.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Erin Dolan is also expanding her role with a new show.</p>
