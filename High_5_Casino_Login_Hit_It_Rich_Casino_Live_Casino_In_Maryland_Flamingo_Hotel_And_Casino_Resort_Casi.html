<p>Interwetten has made a major move as the sports betting provider signed a deal with one of the most successful soccer clubs of today – Liverpool FC. The news broke out ahead of Liverpool’s highly-anticipated Champions League final clash with Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Interwetten Will Provide Unique Entertainment for Liverpool Soccer Fans</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, the Vienna-based provider will be able to provide Liverpool soccer fans with unique entertainment and brand experiences. The company’s speaker on the board, Stefan Sulzbacher, shared a few words on the development by saying that Interwetten always strives for long-term partnerships.</p>
<p>He added that the partnership with Liverpool, which was signed with the help of Onside Sports GmbH is a massive achievement for the company and one that Sulzbacher is very proud of.</p>
<p>Liverpool’s commercial director, Ben Latty¸ stated that the club is excited to launch the Interwetten partnership. He added that thanks to this partnership, regional fans will have unique opportunities and engage in fun activities.</p>
<p>Currently, Interwetten has a plethora of partners across – NHL, PDC, as well as Austrian Ski Federation, and the German Ski Federation. PDC is one of its latest partners as the two parties signed a multi-year agreement back in February.</p>
<p>Interwetten Has Decades of Working Experience in the Sports Betting Industry</p>
<p>As a company based in Vienna, Austria, Interwetten was established in 1990. It provides punters with access to over 70 sports, features over 1,200 unique games, and hosts products by more than 30 suppliers.</p>
<p>All betting offers at Interwetten are international and the platform supports several languages. Its reputation and strive to provide players with the best experience is what allowed the platform to ink deals with respected leagues and federations.</p>
<p>The NHL agreement, for example, allows the bookmaker to increase its brand awareness as it offers individualized entertainment experiences for sports fans. The international business development and partnerships vice president of the NHL, John Lewicki, doubled down on Interwetten’s reputation by saying that the company is “a leader in the sports betting category.”</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, Interwetten gained rights to exclusive NHL offerings in Germany and Austria, as well as access to several digital assets of the league, some of which include NHL.com/de and the official German version of NHL.com, as well as rights to use the official NHL logos, designations, and marks.</p>
<p>Sulzbacher noted that the NHL partnership, and other partnerships for that matter, allow Interwetten to focus on engagement and collaboration long-term. These partnerships also enable “maximum entertainment” for the fans, which is exactly what Interwetten stands for.</p>
<p>Each new partnership is important as it allows Interwetten’s customers to enjoy a larger portfolio of entertainment, according to Sulzbacher.</p>
