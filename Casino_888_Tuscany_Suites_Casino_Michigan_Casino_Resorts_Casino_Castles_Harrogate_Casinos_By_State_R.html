<p>Online casino operator Rootz announced today that a mutually-beneficial agreement with Air Dice would see the addition of new game titles to further expand the choice to players.</p>
<p>Fellow Nordic Partners</p>
<p>The new content distribution deal between Rootz and Air Dice will allow the games lobbies at Wildz, Wheelz, Caxino, Spinz and Chipz to feature some of the most popular titles of the Finnish games provider, including Neon Shifter and Wandering Devourer.</p>
<p>Commenting on the content distribution partnership, Lasse Rantala, chief executive officer of Rootz, pointed to the shared values between Rootz and Air Dice companies, acknowledging growth at the fellow Nordic partner.</p>
<p>“I can appreciate a fellow Nordic company’s growth, as is the case with Air Dice: we have many shared values that include tech development and application and the use of business intelligence and reporting tools,” he said.</p>
<p>Emphasizing “the integration of AI-driven gaming models that provide a seamless and player-centric user experience” as being of key interest and offering great value in the deal, Lantala concluded that the operator anticipates the new games to be welcomed by its players.</p>
<p>Founded in 2002, Air Dice is a privately-owned online casino software developer with a lengthy history in the iGaming sector that has established itself as a specialist in developing slots and strategy influence money games.</p>
<p>Continuous Product Expansion</p>
<p>On behalf of Air Dice, Victor Borg Barthet, director and chief executive officer at Air Dice Services Malta, expressed the provider’s contentment that it would be able to provide Rootz with its games portfolio, outlining the progress achieved by its new partner in the past few years.</p>
<p>“In a short space of 5 years, Rootz and its consumer-facing casino brands have leveraged a state-of-the-art platform focusing on using technology to deliver a superior player experience,” Borg Barthet said, expressing confidence that Rootz casino players will enjoy Air Dice’s games.</p>
<p>The content distribution deal with Air Dice is the latest for the iGaming operator that is constantly looking to grow its library of games for slot enthusiasts and fans of Live Casino experiences, partnering with games providers offering slick and innovative products that align with Rootz’s strategy for success.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Rootz signed a content distribution agreement with Apparat Gaming to add the German provider’s games portfolio to the product offering of Rootz’s online casino brands. The deal followed shortly after Rootz had received its operating license in Germany.</p>
<p>In February this year, Rootz received authorization to offer its casino games in Ontario, marking the second regulated jurisdiction to allow operation and the beginning of Rootz’s expansion globally.</p>
