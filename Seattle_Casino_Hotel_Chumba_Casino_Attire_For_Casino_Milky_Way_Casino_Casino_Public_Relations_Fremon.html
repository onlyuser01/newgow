<p>A 16-year-old employee at the Fremont Street Experience (FSE) McDonald’s, located in downtown Las Vegas, has been arrested. He allegedly fired upon a crowd last month, which left two people injured.</p>

<p>The suspect, Na’quentin Norsworthy, finished his shift at McDonald’s on December 29. He then made his way to the intersection of Third and Fremont and allegedly fired several rounds at the crowd. He was later apprehended.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) officers later charged him with battery with a deadly weapon and assault with a deadly weapon, KLAS, a local TV station, reported.</p>
<p>Detectives identified him as the shooter after viewing the surveillance video. Video footage showed the shooter holding a McDonald’s hat and fleeing the scene after the shooting.</p>
<p>The two victims suffered leg wounds. They both underwent treatment at a local hospital. The injuries were not life-threatening.</p>
<p>Suspect Admits Shooting to Police</p>
<p>On December 30, officers went to Norsworthy’s apartment near Main Street and Washington Avenue in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Police questioned Norsworthy about the shooting. He then admitted to firing the gun because he believed several customers were running after him.</p>
<p>Na’Quinton explained he grabbed a black 9mm Glock handgun from his backpack and shot approximately eight rounds behind him as he ran away, attempting to scare the group that followed him,” according to a police report.</p>
<p>Norsworthy also said he threw the firearm in a parking lot after the shooting, KLAS said. Officers looked for the weapon but did not locate it.</p>
<p>One of the injured victims had been at the McDonald’s location. After ordering and paying for her meal, she asked a cashier for a receipt. The cashier failed to provide her with one. She asked to speak with a manager.</p>
<p>The cashier then made an obscene gesture with his finger. The woman’s relatives got into an argument with the cashier.</p>

<p>It was unclear from initial reports if those who were wounded had interacted with the suspect while he was working in McDonald’s.</p>
<p>Norsworthy’s bail was set at $20,000 by Las Vegas Judge Daniel Westmeyer. It is unknown as of this week if Norsworthy posted bond. Norsworthy was charged as an adult, KLAS said. But after his arrest, he was placed in a Nevada juvenile detention center.</p>
<p>Prior Shooting</p>
<p>Last year, FSE received media attention after several serious shootings and crimes. On June 19, Raymond Renova, 23, was killed during a shooting on the street. He worked as a tattoo artist and lived in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>A second victim was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. He was described as an “innocent bystander.”</p>
<p>LVMPD officers later arrested Ruben Robles, then 16, for the shooting. He was charged with murder, attempted murder, and carrying a concealed weapon. His case is expected to go to trial next April.</p>
<p>In July, another suspect, Fabian Carmona, 22, was also arrested in connection with the June shootings. He is charged with murder with a deadly weapon, attempted murder with a deadly weapon, and conspiracy to commit murder, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.</p>
<p>He allegedly took part in the fight which led to the homicide and assault. Carmona “threw the first punch” and stomped on one of the victims, KLAS reported. He also got stabbed in the fight, the report added.</p>
