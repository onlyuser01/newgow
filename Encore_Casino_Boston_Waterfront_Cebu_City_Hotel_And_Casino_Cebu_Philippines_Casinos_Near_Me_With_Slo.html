<p>The provider that produces up to seven slot titles a month and is famous for its multi-product offering for the iGaming industry, Pragmatic Play, expanded its reach in Europe after announcing a new partnership. The company revealed Wednesday it teamed up with Grand Casino Bern, a leading Swiss operator.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration Pragmatic Play agreed to deliver its leading game titles for the operator's flagship online brand 7melons.ch. As a result, the customers of the brand gain access to popular hits like Sugar Rush, as well as award-winning games including Wolf Gold and Gates of Olympus.</p>
<p>According to Pragmatic Play, once it completes the integration of its slots games for the leading brand, it will also roll out its leading Live Casino games for the operator. Those leading titles include gameshow-style games such as Sweet Bonanza CandyLand and Boom City. Customers of the brand in Switzerland will also enjoy classic games including Blackjack and Roulette.</p>
<p>Bruno Peake, Grand Casino Bern's Director Online Casino, shared his excitement in a statement released on January 11, 2023. "Pragmatic Play has a broad portfolio of incredible, engaging products and we're very pleased to be able to add its complete slot collection to our 7melons site," he pointed out.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Peake said: "It is another exciting step for our online brand, and we look forward to expanding our relationship with Pragmatic Play further."</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, added that the company is excited to forge a new partnership with Grand Casino Bern. She acknowledged that Pragmatic Play has a strong presence in the Swiss gambling market.</p>
<p>"Taking our extensive slot products live with its online arm, 7melons.ch, is another positive step for us in a European regulated market and we look forward to working closely together in the future," said Cornides in conclusion.</p>
<p>The new collaboration further expands Pragmatic Play's presence in Switzerland and Europe as well. In fact, only recently, the company joined forces with the famous Partouche Groupe-owned brand Pasino.ch. Thanks to the new collaboration, Pragmatic Play expanded the reach of its content by rolling out slots for Pasino.ch customers in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the company recently announced a partnership with BetBastet in Brazil. Thanks to the deal, Pragmatic Play agreed to introduce its leading content for customers of the operator in the country, expanding further into the important Latin American market. Under the terms of the collaboration, BetBastet customers can access popular games including slots, live casino and virtual sports titles.</p>
