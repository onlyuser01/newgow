<p>Supplier of innovative sportsbook solutions and platform BETBY announced today the appointment of Rocio Moitino as the firm’s new Head of Sales for Latin America to signal further expansion in the region.</p>
<p>Latin America Key to BETBY’s Growth Plans</p>
<p>As the new addition to BETBY’s ranks, Moitino will be operating out of Uruguay to leverage her industry experience and continue to deliver on BETBY’s commercial growth strategy across the continent. Moitino’s most recent role in her decade-long gambling industry experience was at Sportingtech.</p>
<p>“This project at BETBY is hugely exciting and ambitious and I’m delighted to be a part of it. With an exceptional product, top-tier customer service and hard-working ethos, it is an opportunity that I can’t wait to get started with.” Rocio Moitino, Head of Sales, Latin America, BETBY</p>
<p>The new appointment confirmed BETBY’s emphasis on the importance of the region, looking to build on the success of its hugely popular fully managed sportsbook solution and portfolio of Betby.Games esports titles and further expand its presence.</p>
<p>“We’re always looking to add talent to our team and we’re very happy to be welcoming Rocio to BETBY. Latin America is already a very successful market for us and with Rocio’s addition, I am sure we will be expanding our commercial presence in one of iGaming’s most exciting regions.” Chris Nikolopoulos, Chief Commercial Officer, BETBY</p>
<p>Regional Approach to Building the Business</p>
<p>Moitino’s appointment is set to expand BETBY’s commercial department, following in the footsteps of the internal promotion of Rosaire Galea Cavallaro as Head of Sales for Europe earlier last month. Cavallaro previously served as Sales Manager for the company and his promotion also confirmed BETBY is relying its regional approach to building the business would bring the results.</p>
<p>January, a month that also featured another BETBY appointment, Ilze Ramolina as Senior Lawyer, saw the business continue its 2021 momentum into the new year after agreements with Hero Gaming and Esports Entertainment Group (EEG).</p>
<p>Under the partnership deal with Hero Gaming, BETBY’s products would be further popularized via Hero’s dedicated brands Simple Casino and Boom Casino, while its deal with EEG allowed BETBY to power EEG’s Vie.bet and SportNation betting brands.</p>
<p>BETBY also announced today the company would feature at the upcoming SiGMA Asia summit scheduled to take place from March 20-23 at the Intercontinental Dubai Festival City. BETBY’s CCO Nikolopoulos will be participating in an esports-focused panel during the summit event titled “Battle for the block: how esports and blockchain can grow together.”</p>
