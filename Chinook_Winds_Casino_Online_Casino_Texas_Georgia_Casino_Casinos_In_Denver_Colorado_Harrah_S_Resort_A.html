    <h1>Chinook Winds Casino Online Casino Texas Georgia Casino Casinos In Denver Colorado Harrah S Resort A</h1>

<p>Rubybet casino have closed my account and confiscated the winnings saying this</p>
<p>"Dear Ms. A<strong>*</strong>,</p>
<p>After a careful examination of your account, it has been concluded that you have used modified credentials to be able to create another account with us while previously registered one that was blocked.</p>
<p>The account was registered with modified details than previously, and such, circumvented the block.</p>
<p>Once an account is closed, this means that you will not be able to register another one with your credentials.</p>
<p>On your attempt to register, it was clear that the system will not allow you to register; therefore, you have altered your personal details in order to bypass the system and therefore you were able to register Ruby Bet Casino."</p>
<p>However, I have checked and can find no trace of having another account with Rubybet. I'm not saying it's not possible as I have been an avid on line casino player for some 20 years and cannot recollect everywhere I have ever joined. But as far as I am concerned they have allowed me to join, deposit and play. I am sure they would not be refunding me had I lost. This decision of theirs only comes after I had a winning streak across several of their brands. Quite the coincidence.</p>
<p>They claim I had to change my details in order to bypass their system and create an account. I don't remember the sign up process, why would I? This actually sounds like perfectly reasonable behaviour to me. If your details are wrong or not going through you go back and amend them. Sometimes you cannot reuse a username or email address across several of a brand's casinos but you are still allowed to join each one and you have to change your username or email address etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have zero motivation to have a second Rubybet account. ProgressPlay have an endless supply of different casinos for me to choose from. I do not take their bonuses ever - what do I have to gain by circumventing their sign up system? I hope you can help me with these organisation that has simply, stolen my money.</p>
