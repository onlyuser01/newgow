<p>Los Angeles FC vs. Houston Dynamo is the 2023 Western Conference Final. The game is taking place on LAFC’s turf, BMO Stadium in Los Angeles, California, on Saturday, December 2</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC is the defending MLS Cup champion, which is why it’s no surprise that LAFC vs. Houston odds are in favor of this team. But will it be easy for Steve Cherundolo’s men on Saturday evening? Probably not, as they’re taking on a team that beat them in three of their last four duels.</p>
<p>The most recent of those wins happened at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles, which is where the 2023 MLS Western Conference Final will take place on Saturday.</p>

<p>Los Angeles FC To Take Saturday’s Game Seriously</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC is the main favorite to win the MLS Cup in 2023, which is no surprise as coach Steve Cherundolo has plenty of elite players at his disposal. LAFC’s best players are from the attacking department, most notably, Denis Bouanga who’s the scoring leader of the 2023 MLS.</p>
<p>This guy has scored in each of LAFC’s last six games and no one should be surprised if he does it again. What needs to worry the fans of Los Angeles FC is that Bouanga’s teammates haven’t been as productive as him.</p>
<p>In fact, in LAFC’s last two games, he was the only one to score. Another thing that should worry them is that the team captain Carlos Vela hasn’t scored a single goal since August.</p>
<p>Can Houston Dynamo Pull Off an Upset in the Conference Final?</p>
<p>If Houston Dynamo want to win the 2023 MLS Western Conference title, they need to stop Denis Bouanga. Knowing that he’s never scored against them is certainly giving them hope that they can pull it off.</p>
<p>Plus, their defense has been pretty reliable lately, conceding no more than a goal per 90 minutes in the last nine matches in all competitions. Further, they kept a clean sheet in each of their last two duels with Los Angeles FC, the last of which saw them beat LAFC 1-0 at BMO Stadium.</p>
<p>The only goal was scored by center-back Micael dos Santos Silva. He headed the ball into the LAFC net after a corner. His teammates from the attacking department didn’t do great in that game, though.</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC vs. Houston Dynamo Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams will take Saturday’s game seriously, meaning that we’ll probably see LAFC keep the ball in their possession and Houston Dynamo trying to defend with all they’ve got. So, which soccer strategy will prevail in the 2023 Western Conference Final? We think the first one.</p>
<p>LAFC has better players, especially in the attack, not to mention that these guys will be getting a lot of support from the stands of BMO Stadium.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles FC</p>
