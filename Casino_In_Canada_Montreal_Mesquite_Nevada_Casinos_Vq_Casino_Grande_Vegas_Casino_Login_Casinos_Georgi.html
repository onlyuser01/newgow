<p>The premier provider of land-based and digital casino gaming products, financial technology, content and customer loyalty solutions, Everi Holdings, announced it was recognized with a prestigious award. The company confirmed Monday that it was honored with a 2023 Nevada Top Workplaces award for the third consecutive year. Everi was recognized with the prestigious award by the Las Vegas Review-Journal and Las Vegas Business Press, reaffirming the company's dedication to its employees.</p>
<p>To secure the award the company has gone through an assessment. The prestigious Top Workplaces awards recognize companies based on employee feedback collected from the leading research company called Energage LLC.</p>
<p>The famous research company has surveyed more than 27 million employees within 70,000 different companies over the last 16 years. The anonymous survey "uniquely measures 15 culture drivers that are critical to the success of any organization, including: alignment, execution, and connection, among others," a statement released by Everi reveals.</p>
<p>Eric Rubino, Energage's CEO, shared his excitement about the latest announcement saying: "Earning a Top Workplaces award is a badge of honor for companies, especially because it comes authentically from their employees." He outlined that companies that are honored with the award should be proud.</p>
<p>Finally, Rubino pointed out: "In today's market, leaders must ensure they're allowing employees to have a voice and be heard. That's paramount. Top Workplaces do this, and it pays dividends."</p>
<p>The recognition comes at a time when Everi secured four "Culture Excellence" awards from Top Workplaces earlier this year. The company was recognized for its Compensation and Benefits, Leadership, Work-Life Flexibility and Innovation only recently. Now, the new recognition further complements Everi's leadership position as a top employer.</p>
<p>Randy Taylor, Everi's CEO, shared his excitement about the latest achievement. He said: "We have worked diligently to create a positive company culture with shared values across multiple office locations and with our talented team of remote employees in Nevada, so we are thrilled to be recognized once again by Top Workplaces."</p>
<p>Last but not least, Taylor pointed out: "Our team members, through their dedication and hard work, are directly responsible for creating a cohesive internal culture and, as a result, these award wins."</p>
<p>Back in April, Everi confirmed its plans to acquire certain assets from Video King, the privately-owned leading provider of integrated electronic bingo gaming tables, video gaming content and instant win games. At the time, under the terms of a deal for some $59 million, the company agreed to acquire a majority of the assets from Video King.</p>
