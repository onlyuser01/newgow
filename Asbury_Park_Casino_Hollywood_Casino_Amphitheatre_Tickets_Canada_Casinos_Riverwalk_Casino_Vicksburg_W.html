<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are 2-3, which is their worst start of the season in a while. They need to improve ASAP, meaning that they need to take the Week 6 game against the Washington Football Team (WFT) very seriously.</p>
<p>What’s giving them confidence is that they have a really great record against Washington, with all wins in their six meetings since 1995. Can they keep on beating the WFT? Let’s find out!</p>
<p>Chiefs vs WFT Odds (NFL Week 6, 2021)</p>

<p>WFT Needs to Fear the Chiefs</p>
<p>Although Washington isn’t a bad team, they’re also not too great. In fact, if they might be the most mediocre team in the league. This goes for literally all aspects of the game, as evident by their 2021 record and stats.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the WFT is 2-3 right now, with a score differential of 123-155. Their offense hasn’t been too bad, even though their first-choice quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick got injured early on in the season.</p>
<p>They could’ve done slightly better defensively, but the thing is that they had to play against some really tough offenses. The best example is the Buffalo Bills, the team that beat the Chiefs in Week 5 at Arrowhead.</p>
<p>Kansas’ Superb Offense &amp; Disappointing Defense</p>
<p>Before the start of the 2021 NFL season, the Kansas City Chiefs were the #1 favorite to win the Super Bowl LVI. However, what we’ve seen so far from them since the start of the season suggests that winning Lombardi Trophy is going to be a very difficult challenge for this team.</p>
<p>Their current record is 2-3, which is their worst start of the season since Patrick Mahomes has been their quarterback. Speaking of Mahomes, he and his offensive teammates have been doing a pretty solid job thus far.</p>
<p>In fact, Kansas City has the second most prolific offense in the AFC, with 154 points scored in five games. Unfortunately for then, the Chiefs’ defense has been horrendous. This team has already conceded 164 points, which is more than any other team in the conference.</p>
<p>The good news for the Chiefs is that they know the solution to their problems. If they manage to fix their defense, the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>So, will they? No one can say for certain what’s going to happen in the long run, but against the WFT, they should do better than in the past couple of games.</p>
<p>Pick: Kansas City Chiefs to win and cover the spread; the under might hit.</p>
