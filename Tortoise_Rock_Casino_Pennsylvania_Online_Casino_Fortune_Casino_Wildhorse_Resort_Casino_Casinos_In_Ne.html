<p>The next phase of the resort's revamp seeks to elevate the hotel facilities, contributing toward the initial $1 billion reinvestment</p>
<p>The premier business, entertainment and leisure destination, Marina Bay Sands, confirmed the launch of the second phase of its reinvestment program on Thursday. The next phase of the venue’s transformation represents a reinvestment of $750 million. The second phase of Marina Bay Sands’ redevelopment will help transform Tower 3, ensuring the integrated resort remains a “unique, exhilarating experience for local and international visitors, and meaningfully enhances the tourism appeal of Singapore in the decades ahead.”</p>
<p>The latest reinvestment signals the intention of the resort’s parent company, Las Vegas Sands, to deliver exceptional hospitality experiences. At the same time, the $750-million reinvestment reaffirms the company’s commitment to supporting the hospitality sector, the people and the economy of Singapore. The second phase of the planned redevelopment comes after the company confirmed in February 2022 the initial phase which involved a reinvestment of $1 billion.</p>
<p>Paul Town, Marina Bay Sands’ chief operating officer, revealed that the next phase of the development of the integrated resort marks an exciting moment. He explained that the massive reinvestment seeks to make Singapore more appealing to tourists. “Marina Bay Sands has made significant progress in delivering new world-leading luxury travel experiences over the past two years,” added Town.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that the second phase of the development is “critical” and predicted that once finished, Marina Bay Sands will offer even more thrilling experiences than before. “We look forward to having visitors enjoy these new and enhanced offerings,” explained Town in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We are excited about the next stage of Marina Bay Sands’ development, and how this will strengthen Singapore’s appeal as a leading tourism destination.“ Paul Town, chief operating officer at Marina Bay Sands</p>
<p>The Massive Redevelopment Is Expected to Finish in 2025</p>
<p>During the first phase of Marina Bay Sands’ overhaul, some 1,280 rooms were upgraded. The upgrades affected rooms from the resort’s The Sands Collection and The Paiza Collection. The new phase is now expected to redesign more than 550 rooms.</p>
<p>Besides improving its hotel rooms, Marina Bay Sands will also improve its retail and dining outlets. The lobby of Tower 3 of the resort will go through an overhaul and new amenities will be introduced for the guests, including a “reimagined VIP arrival experience.”</p>
<p>The completion of the redevelopment at Marina Bay Sands is expected to conclude at some point in 2025. Once the revamp is completed, guests will benefit from 1,850 refurbished luxury hotel rooms and supreme amenities, ensuring that the resort destination offers exceptional experiences for decades ahead.</p>
