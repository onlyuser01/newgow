<p>Power of Gods: Valhalla – Game Symbols</p>
<p>To win, players must match a minimum of eight identical symbols anywhere on the reels. The game’s symbols are represented by Norse gods filling the reels, with Thor’s hammer acting as the wild symbol during the base game. To activate the Hold the Jackpot round, players must land a minimum of six bonus symbols. When between three and five bonus symbols land during a spin, they turn into sticky symbols during a new spin that will boost the odds of engaging the bonus feature.</p>
<p>Re-Spins and Multipliers</p>
<p>The bonus game begins with three Re-Spins. Each new successful spin automatically resets the count. At the same time, the bonus symbols can feature cash multipliers worth up to 15x. They can also be represented by one of the three available jackpots: Mini, Minor, and Major. When all 16 spots are filled, players receive the Grand Jackpot valued at 1,000x. The jackpot is added to their win up to a total of 2145x the original bet.</p>
<p>Wazdan’s chief commercial officer Andrzej Hyla spoke about the Power of Gods series, describing how it carries players on a “journey through some of history’s most exciting times”. He also explained how their latest installment invites gamers to “go back in time to the harsh Viking saga” period. Hyla also talked about the new game that incorporates the Hold the Jackpot game mechanic which pays anywhere, presenting it as a one-of-a-kind experience for fans of the genre. At the beginning of July, Wazdan decided to power Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino with its fresh content. In June, the company signed a similar agreement with PressEnter’s brands. The provider that was rewarded with two prestigious titles at the Baltic and Scandinavian Gaming Awards also added other exciting titles to its rich library in the last months. The list includes 9 Burning Dragons, Sizzling Eggs, and Magic Spins</p>
