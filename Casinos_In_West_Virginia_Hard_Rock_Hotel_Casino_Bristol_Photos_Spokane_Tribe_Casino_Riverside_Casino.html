<p>Isleta Resort and Casino, a gambling and hospitality venue in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has enriched its offerings with a new hybrid digital roulette table, courtesy of Interblock.</p>
<p>Isleta Launched a New Table from Interblock</p>
<p>Interblock is one of the world’s best providers of luxury electronic tables. As such, the company has supplied Isleta Resort and Casino with one of its finest products – a hybrid digital roulette table. The new table boasts two live interconnected color-coded roulette wheels. According to the operator, Isleta is now the first venue in the world to run a live dual roulette table.</p>
<p>The dual element will allow the new table to be twice as profitable as a classic game of roulette. The new product showcases Interblock’s knack for innovation, as well as its understanding of how to create products that are both novel and exciting without reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>The dual roulette is a fairly simple yet effective concept that will provide Isleta visitors with unorthodox experiences. While some people are concerned about the safer gambling aspect of the new game, experts suggested that enforcing lower minimum bets will prevent irresponsible play.</p>
<p>The New Offering Quickly Became a Fan Favorite</p>
<p>Calvin Jiron, Isleta’s director of table games, welcomed the new addition to the casino’s roster. He called the dual-roulette idea “an amazingly fun way” to enjoy the classic table game.</p>
<p>With over 120 spins per hour, our players love the fast-paced play as much as the excitement of playing on two wheels at the same time. As the first of its kind, it’s going to attract table game players from all over the state. Calvin Jiron, director of table games, Isleta Resort and Casino</p>
<p>Jiron lauded Interblock’s capabilities, saying that the double roulette is so exciting that even people who usually prefer slot games are now regulars at the new table. The director concluded that the new concept makes it easy to play and earn money from double bets.</p>
<p>Interblock Continues Its Expansion</p>
<p>Interblock is steadily expanding its presence in the gaming industry by launching new products with some of the best global and regional operators. The company recently reinforced its footprint in Romania by launching its Universal Cabinet Blackjack casino tables at the Elite Slots Casino in Pitesti.</p>
<p>Interblock is able to innovate the casino sector thanks to its experienced team of gambling industry veterans. In August, for example, the luxury solution developer welcomed Marco Herrera to the company, naming him president of the EMEA region. Herrera has a proven track record of boosting businesses and is one of the many steps Interblock has taken to expand its presence in the region.</p>
