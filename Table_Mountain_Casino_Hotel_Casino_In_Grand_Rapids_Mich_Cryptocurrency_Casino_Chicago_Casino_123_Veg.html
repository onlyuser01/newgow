<p>Marmorato sees the planned casino as a potential nightmare for the well-being of the residents</p>
<p>The casino industry is wary of the future of Bally’s Bronx casino project following Kristy Marmorato’s triumph in the Bronx. The Republican, who has previously expressed her opposition to the project, won the Bronx seat at the New York City Council.</p>
<p>Marmorato dealt a historic defeat to her opponent, the incumbent District 13 representative Marjorie Velasquez, turning a Bronx seat red for the first time in decades. Unfortunately for Bally’s, Marmorato isn’t as supportive of its casino project as Velasquez.</p>
<p>Velasquez supported the casino operator’s project, believing it to be a potential boon to the local economy. Marmorato, on the other hand, sees the planned casino as a potential nightmare for the well-being of the local people.</p>
<p>According to the newly elected District 13 representative, the Bronx is one of the New York areas with the highest asthma rates. As a result, the traffic a casino can generate could be an “environmental nightmare.”</p>
<p>Marmorato will step into the office in January and could turn out to be be a major setback for Bally’s plans.</p>
<p>The NY Casino License Race Continues</p>
<p>The Ferry Links Golf Course is a famous property that was leased to the Trump Organization, which enhanced it by developing a large clubhouse and an events facility. Bally’s current plan is to also construct a casino resort at the property, should it win one of the three downstate New York licenses currently on the table.</p>
<p>Bally’s secured the transfer of the lease in a $60 million deal with the Trump Organization a few weeks ago, allowing it to proceed with its pitch.</p>
<p>The 20-year lease was issued to the Trump Organization in 2015 but caused controversies in the wake of the Capitol riot. The New York Parks Department now hopes that Bally’s would be a suitable successor to the property and will take good care of it.</p>
<p>Last month, the Soloviev Group updated its proposal in hopes of winning one of the three casino licenses. The group published an updated plan that featured over 500 permanent affordable housing units, hoping to make its bid more appealing.</p>
<p>Speaking of New York, the state became the first US jurisdiction to surpass $2 billion in monthly betting handle after hitting a staggering $2,006,823,408 in September.</p>
