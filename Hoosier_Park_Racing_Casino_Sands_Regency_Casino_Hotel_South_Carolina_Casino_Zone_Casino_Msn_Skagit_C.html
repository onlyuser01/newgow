<p>Peter &amp; Sons, a promising and innovation-driven iGaming supplier and studio, has celebrated yet another achievement with the company gaining a foothold in the regulated market in Ontario, Canada. This has been made possible through a partnership with SkillOnNet and will see the certified supplier now deploy its outstanding list of titles with leading casinos powered by the latter, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>Among those are such recognized brands as KnightsSlots, SpinGenie, PlayOJO, and SlotsMagic. All of them will now get a further nudge along by Peter &amp; Sonsâ€™ standout portfolio that features popular games such as Water Blox, Voodoo Hex, Wild One, Book of Books, and many others, as the supplier is also revving up production this year.</p>
<p>Having long build world-class games, Peter &amp; Sons will use this opportunity to further consolidate its global footprint and create experiences that are recognizable and compelling.</p>
<p>Commenting on this successful milestone, Peter &amp; Sons Business Development Director Yann Bautista said that the entire company was excited about the opportunity to hit the ground running in Ontario with some of the best and most prominent operators in the local market.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet Head of Games Jani Kontturi was similarly pleased with the opportunity. "Peter &amp; Sons is an important partner studio and so it was natural we would introduce its games to Ontario, which is proving to be a key market for us," he explained</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons has been actively trying to build up its geographical footprint, announcing several related partnerships in 2023. One of those was signed with Tequity Ventures, known for its Remote Game Server Platform, and another with Hub88, a company that creates a single hub for multiple gaming suppliers and allows operators to quickly deploy cutting-edge titles to their players.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet and Peter &amp; Sons are no strangers either. At the end of 2023, SkillOnNet confirmed that it had invested in the innovative studio, helping it bankroll its expansion and quicken its production pace into the new year.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons welcomed the financial boost and vote of confidence at the time with Peter &amp; Sons Co-Founder Mitri Wiberg promising more innovative features and releases into the new year.</p>
