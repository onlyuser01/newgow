<p>The Week 13 MNF game is the second time this season that the Cincinnati Bengals will be without Joe Burrow. Last weekend, they lost 16-10 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in a game in which Jake Browning took the place of injured Burrow.</p>
<p>His second start as the Cincinnati quarterback will be this Monday against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Will he and his teammates do better this time? The Cincinnati Bengals vs. Jacksonville Jaguars odds suggest they won’t – the team from Florida is seen as an 8.5-point favorite.</p>

<p>Last Chance for Cincinnati Bengals</p>
<p>The Cincinnati Bengals are 5-6 on the season. They’re in the AFC North Division, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, and Baltimore Ravens. Winning the Division is practically impossible for them, but they still do have a chance to get to the playoffs via the wild card.</p>
<p>For that, however, they’ll need to start winning again. They’re on a three-game losing skid, but the biggest problem is that they’re without their starting quarterback. Joe Burrow, who’s the highest-paid player in the 2023 NFL, got injured two weeks ago and won’t return until 2024.</p>
<p>With backup QB Jake Browning, their chance of making the playoffs doesn’t look great. He went 19-for-26 in his first game as a starter, throwing for 227 yards, one touchdown, and getting one of his passes intercepted.</p>
<p>It’s not too bad given that the Bengals’ opponent was Pittsburgh, a team with incredible defenders. Nevertheless, Browning will have to do better this Monday if he wants to keep his team in the contest for a place in the postseason.</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars are a Few Wins Away from Winning the AFC South</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars are 8-3 in the 2023 NFL season, which is two wins more than the Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts, their rivals for the AFC South title. That said, the Jags are just a few wins away from securing the divisional title and stamping their ticket to the postseason.</p>
<p>Their schedule for the remainder of the 2023 regular season doesn’t look too difficult, but they will have a couple of tough games after the duel with the Bengals.</p>
<p>That’s why winning the MNF game is a must for these guys. Winning the game would give them a major confidence boost ahead of tougher matchups, as well as get them closer to securing a playoff spot.</p>
<p>They want to win on Monday night, but do they have the player quality to pull it off?</p>
<p>Cincinnati Bengals vs. Jacksonville Jaguars Prediction</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars will win the Week 13 MNF game, there’s no doubt about that. But will they be able to cover the 8.5-point spread? We’re not so sure about that. The Bengals are good defensively and could create serious problems for Trevor Lawrence and the Jags’ offense.</p>
<p>Picks: Cincinnati Bengals +8.5 (-110)</p>
