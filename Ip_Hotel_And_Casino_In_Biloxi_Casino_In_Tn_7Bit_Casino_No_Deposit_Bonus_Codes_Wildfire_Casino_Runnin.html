<p>Sizzling Spins review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fire up the barbeque and settle in for a picnic with Sizzling Spins.</p>
<p>Players will join a summer yard party and try their hand at cooking a feast that includes hotdogs, ribs, chicken, and all the sides. As the coals heat up, they’ll sample a range of culinary delights.</p>
<p>This slot is perfect for foodies, and those longing for an old-fashioned cookout.</p>
<p>Win in the base game featuring multiple Wild symbols</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A barbecue rack serves as the reels, showcasing a variety of freshly grilled snacks. The realistic animation style means that each item of food appears mouthwatering. Herb-covered shrimp, sliced mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, salmon, and corn all appear among the symbols.</p>
<p>Coals softly glow in the barbecue behind the food, hinting that the food is cooking well and will soon be ready to eat. Farther in the background, fresh green grass is visible with the late afternoon shadows of trees swaying gently.</p>
<p>The soundtrack consists of a soft rock that sounds slightly distant, as if players are in a garden with music emanating from the nearby house. This adds to the relaxing party vibe.</p>
<p>Together, the animation and soundtrack create a laid back atmosphere that will leave players feeling hungry for a barbecue.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Sizzling Spins slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Sizzling Spins is a five-reel, three-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>During the base game, there are 243 ways to win, but during the Free Spins feature, this increases to 1024 ways (see further details below).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Wilds are hidden within Foil Blocker symbols but once revealed, they substitute for every symbol except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>During every spin, one of the reels is assigned to be the Hot Reel. Whenever Foil Blockers land on the Hot Reel, they open to reveal Wilds. The Wilds in turn trigger a respin and if a Wild appears after a fourth respin, the player’s winnings are doubled.</p>
<p>Unlocking the Foil Blocker symbol triggers the Respin feature</p>
<p>If players land 3 Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature begins. The Free Spins feature is played on an expanded set of reels.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, players can collect Scatter symbols to increase a win multiplier up to 5x.</p>
<p>Respins function the same way during the Free Spins feature as they do during the base game.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Sizzling Spins is 96.00%, right on our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Sizzling Spins is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend Sizzling Spins with its average RTP and high volatility.</p>
<p>The reasonable RTP and ample volatility mean that Sizzling Spins is a solid find for mathematically-inclined players.</p>
<p>The extremely high-quality animation and welcoming party vibe ensure that this slot is immediately enjoyable to play, and the bonuses only add more fun.</p>
