<p>Crazy Mix review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Crazy Mix has a festive Australian theme.</p>
<p>Players will arrive in the Australian wilderness, accompanied by some rugged guides. A host of animals including turtles and koalas greet players with friendly smiles. Exotic fruits are also on offer in temptingly bright colours.</p>
<p>This game is a good fit for players looking for a whimsical exotic holiday vibe.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a chilled out tune that feels intended for holiday fun, but also has a pace that escalates pressure. This may prompt some players to opt to click mute.</p>
<p>The colourful symbols include classic Australian animals such as koalas and kangaroos. These creatures are animated in a cheerful cartoon smile that will make players want to befriend them.</p>
<p>The exotic fruit symbols are animated with a slightly more realistic style, showcasing their unique colours and textures.</p>
<p>The backdrop behind the reels is a fanciful interpretation of the Australian wilderness. Whimsical baobab trees are topped with pink leaves and the iconic red road is lined with spiky foliage.</p>
<p>The game’s hosts Chuck and Aneka are dressed for a chill outdoor party. Chuck sports sunglasses and swim trunks, while Aneka’s hair is adorned with flowers.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music combine for a festive, distinctively Australian atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Crazy Mix is a five reel, three row slot with 15 win lines.</p>
<p>Winning combinations are created from left to right with a minimum of 3 symbols in a row for a winning combination.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. The Wild symbols come in two forms, Chuck’s face and Aneka’s face, with the Chuck Wild also triggering respins and collecting Fruit symbols.</p>
<p>During the Boomerang Respins feature, players are awarded a respin, a collectable Fruit symbol, as well as a +1 multiplier whenever the Chuck symbol lands.</p>
<p>The Cocktail Free Spins feature is awarded when players gather 4 or more Fruit symbols. They begin the feature with 5 free spins. Depending on the combination of Fruits symbols, different bonus features will be in effect. These bonuses can include: random Wilds, bet multipliers, and additional free spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.35%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.15 up to a maximum of $/£/€45 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility Australian-themed slot.</p>
<p>With an excellent strategy profile, this Crazy Mix is a great pick for players looking to maximise their wins.</p>
<p>The Australian theme is enticing, and the addition of fruit-themed bonuses is an extra sweet nod to classic fruit machines.</p>
