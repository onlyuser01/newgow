<p>Hello again and thank you for you answer.</p>
<p>First things first I want to tell that the KYC process went ok, my profile was ferified and the ammount was sent to me today.</p>
<p>I understand perfectly that KYC is the most important process.</p>
<p>The problem was that I sent more than 10 pictures of the ID card or selfies with the ID card. The general problem was that i couldnt understand what is the problem with the documents. I understand it later when i contact via chat or email. So after 3-4 tries i thought I am sent regular picture or document but they turn the documents back. Also they did not accept pdf, but later accepted it.</p>
<p>Also I couldnt understood which documents were accepted and which are not.</p>
<p>After a few contacts with the customer service they explain me what they are expecting from me.</p>
<p>On the second question. I sent all the statements and documents for both the accounts I am using, so they had statement for the account i used to top up my profile and the account i wanted to use to withdrawl the ammount.</p>
<p>Every time I was contacting them they had different reason to not verify my profile.</p>
<p>I was in a situation that I cannot understand what do i have to make to get verified.</p>
<p>Later on i have to be honest I received the information, but you know it was strange to put so much documents and to not know what is going on.</p>
<p>I have to admit the vision of the website was changed and now it is easier to deal with everything.</p>
<p>I have to tell that the support was great and i am happy that everything is find at the end, but was scared because sometimes first you think is some fraud.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
