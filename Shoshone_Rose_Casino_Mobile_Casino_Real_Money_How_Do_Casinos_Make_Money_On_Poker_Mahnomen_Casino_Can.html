    <h1>Shoshone Rose Casino Mobile Casino Real Money How Do Casinos Make Money On Poker Mahnomen Casino Can</h1>

<p>Sry I didn't get back to you sooner but I requested my withdrawal on the 21st of July .. well at first I tried to do it with coindraw cause it said fast and secure withdrawal but it said I wasn't eligible because I hadn't made three deposits within the time frame but let me assure you I made over ten in two days</p>
<p>All with bitcoin but the last one I made had to be manually added to my account because it was confirmed on my end and never added to my account so I had to contact them and they added it so that's why they said that I wasn't eligible for that so I requested it in bitcoin and I asked how long it would take they said 7 to 10 business days so I wanted to know why I couldn't get it sooner because I should be eligible for coindraw which says received your bitcoin payout within 24hrs but long story short they said its the system they can not change it so I wa speaking with vip manager her name was rhea and she told me that she would work on getting it faster to verify my ID and I did sent it in right away and then she said it was approved and it 7 to 10 business days now today the 28th of July I sent another message to chat asking about my withdrawal and they said they need to verify my account to move the withdrawal process further to go to cashier select withdrawal and it will say about verifying your account which it did when I did it on the 21st but not anymore cause it was verified already but there telling me it wasn't so I sent it via email they said they received it and it needs to be verified by the document department and after they verifies it it should be 7 to 10 business days the amount requested is $600 and yes it's my first withdrawal but it sounds like there giving me the run around also on the 21st when the first manager rhea I spoke to said it was approved I no longer seen it in my account but please help me and someone needs to do something about this casino and how they handle the withdrawal process because they receive my deposits or I don't get to play th e y don't have to wait a month for them to get money but trying to get money from them is a big deal please let me know what I need to do next thanks</p>
