<p>Denver Broncos vs. Kansas City Chiefs is the Thursday Night Football game of Week 6 of the 2023 NFL. It’s on the program on October 12 at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City.</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are the reigning champions who are determined to keep the Lombardi Trophy in their possession for another year. Judging by their form at the start of the 2023 NFL season, Andy Reid’s men have every right to feel optimistic – they’re 4-1 right now!</p>
<p>It’s just the opposite when it comes to their next opponents, the Denver Broncos, who are 1-4 ahead of Week 6. These guys have been horrible defensively with 181 points conceded in five games. That is something that makes them dread their trip to Kansas City where they’re going to face one of the NFL’s best offensive teams.</p>

<p>Denver Broncos Praying They Don’t Get Embarrassed at Arrowhead</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos just don’t stand a chance of beating the Kansas City Chiefs at the moment. They haven’t done it since 2015, which is two years before the Patrick Mahomes era started in Kansas. Further, their recent form is horrible, especially when it comes to defending. They’re the team that’s been conceding the most points in the entire league – 36.5 points per game on average.</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins are up 70-20 on the Denver Broncos. Dolphins running backs have EIGHT TDs—5 rushing, 3 receiving.</p>
<p>Rookie De’von Achane had one rush for five yards coming into today. He has 18 rushes for 203 yards today.</p>
<p>A Beatdown of Epic Proportions.pic.twitter.com/pElkAGNwk8 — Polaski (@josephdrobbins) September 24, 2023</p>
<p>Sure, the reason for that is that they got obliterated by the Miami Dolphins in Week 3 when we saw them concede 70 points. But even without that humiliating loss, their defense has still been very disappointing.</p>
<p>The good news for them is that their offense has been doing alright. Quarterback Russell Wilson has been much better in 2023 than last year, the result of which is that the Broncos are now scoring 24.2 points per game. That’s almost as good as the Chiefs (25.6).</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs to Continue Their Winning Streak</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Detroit Lions in Week 1, which came as a shock to most people as the game was played at Arrowhead. We, however, weren’t too surprised because the Chiefs were without Travis Kelce and many other key men in that game.</p>
<p>It’s been a whole different story since Kelce &amp; Co. made their comeback. Since the loss in the first week, the Super Bowl LVII winners are 4-0. Truth be told, they played against mediocre teams, to put it mildly – the Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears, New York Jets, and Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>Their schedule won’t turn ugly anytime soon. This Thursday, they’re taking on one of the worst teams in the 2023 NFL. After that, they’ll have ten days to prepare for the game with the LA Chargers. What this practically means is that they have the luxury to go all-in on the Week 6 TNF game.</p>
<p>Denver Broncos vs. Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are preparing a real spectacle for their fans in the TNF game. They know the Broncos are vulnerable defensively, and they’re going to exploit that. With Mahomes, Kelce, and the rest being in top shape, the Chiefs are ready to put on their best home performance of the 2023 season. The last time they played at Arrowhead, they scored 41 points. This time, we think they could go even higher.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
