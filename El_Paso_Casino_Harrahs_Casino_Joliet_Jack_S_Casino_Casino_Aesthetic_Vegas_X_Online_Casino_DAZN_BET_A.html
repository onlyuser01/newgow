    <h1>El Paso Casino Harrahs Casino Joliet Jack S Casino Casino Aesthetic Vegas X Online Casino DAZN BET A</h1>

<p>DAZN BET has ensured that it picks up the greatest talents in the industry as the sports entertainment business has added Matt Hartington as the director of legal. Hartington is an ex-exec at Flutter Entertainment, a company that is dedicated to building a sustainable future. He worked as the head of legal for Ireland and the UK since the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Hartington Joins a Team of Experts At DAZN BET</p>
<p>Hartington is not the first high-end industry expert to join the DAZN BET team. Shane McLaughlin, ex- Betdaq MD, was also appointed by the company recently. Additionally, Simon Gatenby, the former technology director at Entain, was also hired by DAZN BET.</p>
<p>McLaughlin will be working at the company as Ontario and UK MD, while Gatenby was appointed as a chief marketing officer.</p>
<p>While speaking about the new appointment, Hartington noted that even though ending his chapter at Sky Betting and Gaming is “bittersweet,” he’s very excited about his future as director of legal at DAZN BET. He thanked everyone at Sky Betting and Gaming for their contributions and concluded by saying that he “can’t wait to get going” at DAZN BET.</p>
<p>Before joining DAZN BET, Hartington spent five years at SBG. He joined the company as a legal counsel back in 2016. DAZN BET will be led by Mark Kemp, joined from Boyle. Kemp was named as the company’s new CEO.</p>
<p>Most recently, DAZN BET expanded its sportsbook team with Gemma Burge, who will be working as the new safer gambling head. Even though Burge is relatively new to the gambling sector, she is a risk manager with almost 20 years of cross-industry working experience.</p>
<p>DAZN BET Is a Partnership Between DAZN and Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>DAZN announced the strategic partnership with Pragmatic Play back in April 2022. DAZN BET is set to provide sports fans with a unique sports betting experience. DAZN BET is headquartered in Gibraltar and its platform is powered by Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The CEO of DAZN Group, Shay Segev, commented on the development by saying that the future belongs to the “convergence of sports media and betting.” That is exactly what the partnership between DAZN and Pragmatic is looking to achieve.</p>
<p>Segev praised Pragmatic and said that this provider is committed to developing unique and innovative experiences for players. On the other side, DAZN will remain committed to revitalising the sports viewing experience.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Solutions’ CEO, Ashley Yang, praised DAZN by saying that it is an honor for Pragmatic to partner with such a reputable company. Lang doubled down on the fact that fans want a more immersive and interactive experience and that is exactly what this partnership aims to deliver.</p>
