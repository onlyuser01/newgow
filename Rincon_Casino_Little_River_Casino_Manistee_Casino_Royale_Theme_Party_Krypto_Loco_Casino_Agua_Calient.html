<p>FanDuel, the premier sports betting, daily fantasy sports and online gambling leader in the US, is planning further expansion into TV, a new report suggests.</p>
<p>FanDuel Reportedly Seeks to Rebrand TVG</p>
<p>Seeking to further grow as a sports media company, FanDuel may be rebranding its leading horse racing channel TVG to FanDuel TV, reveals a new report released by Legal Sports Report. Documents that were forwarded to the company’s staff and reviewed by the media outlet reveal that the rebranding is planned to take place this September.</p>
<p>As a part of the changes, TVG would be rebranded to FanDuel TV, while TVG2 would become FanDuel Racing. What’s more, the TVG OTT app would be rebranded to FanDuel+, but the TVG horse betting website and application would not go through changes.</p>
<p>Sports Fans to Enjoy New Content</p>
<p>According to the recent report, with the rebranding FanDuel plans to “create the first watch and wager TV network in the US.” Complementing the changes further, it is expected that the former Good Morning Football host, Kay Adams, to spearhead TVG’s headline 7 AM slot hosting a “new SportsCenter-style show,” LSR revealed. Adams is yet to confirm officially collaboration with FanDuel. Similarly, due to the complexity of the process, FanDuel hasn’t yet released official details regarding the possible rebranding.</p>
<p>The recent report unveils that the TVG channel may also undergo content changes and “shift away from horse racing.” Besides a Sports-Center-style show, the rebranded flagship channel may include NBA content, as well as a show with the famous American sports analysts and professional wrestler and commentator, Pat McAfee. Last but not least, the rebranding is expected to create new betting opportunities for sports fans. Those would include sports such as Chinese basketball and Korean football, which sports fans can watch and wager.</p>
<p>Recently FanDuel Unveiled Senior Leadership Changes</p>
<p>The announcement comes at a time when only recently, FanDuel unveiled two new senior management appointments. The leadership-level change saw Christian Genetski, who served as the company’s chief legal officer, become its new president. Additionally, FanDuel appointed Mike Raffensperger to serve as its chief commercial officer. Formerly, Raffensperger served as a chief marketing officer.</p>
<p>The senior management appointments reaffirm FanDuel’s plans for further growth. As a part of the change, the duo will report directly to the company’s CEO, Amy Howe. Sharing her excitement, Howe acknowledged that Raffensperger and Genetski have a track record not only as a part of FanDuel. She predicted that the duo will help FanDuel continue to grow.</p>
