<p>UK Election Implications: FOBTs Could Feel Hung Parliament’s Squeeze</p>

<p>Britain woke up to last week after Friday’s shock election result already a bit nervous about what lay ahead. For bookmakers, at issue suddenly becomes the fate of their growing reliance on revenue from fixed-odds betting terminals.</p>
<p>Shares in major retail bookmakers have fallen since the election result.</p>
<p>Barclays estimated this week that Ladbrokes Coral, the market leader for retail betting, would lose £439 million in revenue next year if FOBT stakes were cut to £2, while rival William Hill would lose £288 million.</p>
<p>Safe Moneymaker Under Tories</p>
<p>FOBTs now account for nearly 50 percent of land-based bookmaker profits.</p>
<p>Under a Conservative government, the British bookmaking industry could reassure itself that FOBTs would be kept relatively safe, thanks to the millions in tax revenue the machines currently generate. But with a hung parliament in control, that status is suddenly less clear.</p>
<p>The highly controversial machines, 35,000 of which are installed in betting shops throughout the country, allow customers to bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on digital fixed-odds casino games, typically roulette.</p>
<p>Critics say FOBTs contribute to an increase in crime and problem gambling, and liken them to crack cocaine. A recent cross-party review recommended slashing the maximum stake from £100 to £2, a proposal met with alarm by the bookmaking industry.</p>
<p>But the Association of British Bookmakers balked, claiming such a move could cost some 20,000 jobs and force hundreds of betting shops to close.</p>
<p>Labour’s Last Stand?</p>
<p>Having formed an unstable alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, Prime Minister Theresa May’s government now has a slender majority against an handful of opposition parties, all of whom could be gunning for FOBTs.</p>
<p>The Labour Party’s Jeremy Corbyn has been leading that charge, and even the DUP has voiced opposition to the machines.</p>
<p>From his party’s manifesto: “We will reduce the maximum stake on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals from £100 to £2 … Labour will also legislate to increase the delay in between spins on these games in order to reduce the addictive nature of the games.”</p>
<p>The ABB disputes any suggestion that the machines are harmful or that changing the betting limits would have a dramatic impact. “It is important to recognize that recent independent evidence has shown that there is no link between gaming machines in betting shops and problem gambling,”</p>
