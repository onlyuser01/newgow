<p>Gross Gambling Yield (GGY) for remote gambling activities such as casino, betting and bingo skyrocketed in the UK for the period between April 2020 and March 2021. The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) has announced new figures that reveal that remote GGY in the country has hit $9.13 billion (£6.9 billion). This marked a significant increase of 18.4% when compared to the same period in 2019-2020.</p>
<p>A New Report Reveals That Remote GGY in 2020-2021 Hit $9 Billion</p>
<p>The bigger part of the $9.13 billion (£6.9 billion) GGY was raised by online casino games. For the period April 2020 through March 2021, online casino games generated $5.3 billion (£4.0 billion) in GGY. The bigger part of that revenue or some $3.8 billion (£2.9 billion) in GGY was raised by slots games.</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission revealed that remote betting GGY hit $3.4 billion (£2.6 billion) for the period. The betting activities were led mainly by football that contributed $1.5 billion (£1.2 billion). The second-most popular was horse betting that generated some $1.1 billion (£0.9 billion) in GGY.</p>
<p>The result comes despite the significant number of global sporting events, which were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic last year. With that in mind, the GC did acknowledge that the pandemic and various lockdown restrictions and rules have impacted the gambling industry significantly. In fact, the Commission said that it has excluded “estimates where returns have either been late or are not yet due as we would not have confidence in their accuracy.”</p>
<p>National Lottery Marks Record Sales</p>
<p>The new report reveals that remote bingo generated $250 million (£189.1 million) in GGY for the period. Additionally, the GC said that National Lottery ticket sales have hit $11.1 billion (£8.4 billion). From that total, $6.5 billion (£4.9 billion) was received as prizes.</p>
<p>For the period between April 2020 and March 2021, the GC said that it recorded strong levels of return to good causes. The contributions to good causes within that period have hit $2.25 billion (£1.7 billion).</p>
<p>We have seen the highest annual National Lottery sales since we started reporting these statistics, along with strong levels of Returns to Good Causes,” reads the latest report by the Gambling Commission</p>
<p>GC’s latest report also revealed that as of March 31, 2021, the number of operators licensed by the Commission has decreased slightly. As a result, there were 2,439 operators, which marks a 5.4% decrease when compared to the previous period.</p>
