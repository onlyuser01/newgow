    <h1>Mgm Casino Near Me Richmond Casino Vote Pulsz Casino Free Sc Casino Grand Bay 4 Queens Casino The Cl</h1>

<p>Just reading the word screenshot gives me a panic attack. For every complaint about software problems at the Clubhouse Casino, I should always take screenshots. If I'm kicked out of a game I'm back to the page before I entered the game, so a screenshot doesn't help. If the game kept running and didn't stop, a screenshot doesn't help, that's exactly how it is when I didn't get into the game. You can't imagine how much I wrote, discussed and had to justify myself. What I had to accept was bullying.</p>
<p>Now to the game which is cheating and misleading. Where, despite my complaint, neither the live chat nor the manager did anything about it. Once again I was portrayed as stupid and a liar.</p>
<p>It's about the game Rise of Triton. You can get into the bonus round with 3 scatter symbols, which of course didn't work for me and then there is a bonus round where you have to have 6 white circles in one spin where there is an amount of money in each circle. If you can do that, you will come to another page where the 6 circles you turned come with you. Then you have three spins, with each spin new balls with amounts of money fall from top to bottom. If you stay standing, you win the amount in the ball. Whenever a ball stops, you have another 3 spins until they are gone at some point. Then the amounts in the standing balls are added together and you win. In the normal round there are 2-5 balls which is not enough for the bonus round. The amounts in the balls are always, I repeat, between 30 and 900 euros. Sometimes 750 euros 250 100 50 75 600 850 250 euros so always, I repeat, always in the high range. It takes ages to get 6 balls for the bonus round. This means that there are so many balls with large amounts remaining in the rounds in front of them. You get annoyed by the amounts when you only get 4 or 5 balls, but you keep playing because you only see these high amounts in the balls. Then suddenly at some point 6 balls stop standing and you are happy, but only for a short time because all 6 balls have the amount 2.50 in them. Before, the amount wasn't even in 200 balls and now each one has such a mini amount. It goes even further, in the bonus round there are still 6 balls left and each one says 2.50. You bet so much beforehand because you think you can win big here because there are only large amounts in the balls and then this happens. It couldn't be more misleading and those you think are refusing to help you</p>
