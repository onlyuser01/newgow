    <h1>Casino Boat Myrtle Beach Cancun Casino Vegas X Org Casino Bay Mills Resort And Casino In Brimley Mic</h1>

<p>I joined YummyWinsCasino on 27th September 2022.</p>
<p>I deposited on my first day over approximately 200 euros with my visa debit card and fortunately I won. My total deposits to this casino have been over 600 Euros in total upto the 4th October 2022.</p>
<p>I completed all the verification process so be it that was made rather difficult as the site wanted the same documents again or there was a problem with the selfie or some excuse. However finally it got done.</p>
<p>I was told I was only allowed to withdraw 500 Euros which was extremely disappointing as I won approximately 5000 Euro.</p>
<p>In the terms and conditions reads you can withdraw up to 10000 a day.</p>
<p>I was told by online chat agents and customer service I was not allowed to put another withdrawal request in until the first had been done and then I could request every 36 hours another 500 Euro. They said I would have to deposit each month to be able to request withdrawals. I continued to deposit but at the time still waiting for my withdrawal to reach my bank.</p>
<p>This IS NOT WHAT IT READS IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR WITHDRAWAL AMOUNTS.</p>
<p>I have never received the 500 Euros from the site and over 50 emails back and forth the emails from customer service contradict each other reading different or the same in relation to my withdrawal. Most being excuses and asking me to continue to kindly wait.</p>
<p>I was told the payment was sent on the 29th September 2022. It reads approved on the 28th September in my profile.</p>
<p>I never received nothing from them and asked for a receipt as proof of payment. One email reads that they do not produce such a service to produce a receipt another email reads a receipt had been requested. I never ever received a receipt to prove the payment had been sent.</p>
<p>I was then asked to provide bank statements on a daily basis up to the 8th October 2022 which I provided to the site proving to them I had not received anything from them.</p>
<p>I have spoken to the Manger of the site (Brian) on the telephone on 2 occasions.</p>
<p>He asked for me to email him required documents being the same bank statement. In one of his replies to my email he states I sent an old statement, I never, so again I sent the same correctly dated bank statement he had requested. Remember, this had been sent to customer services already. On the 2nd telephone conversation he went in depth about procedures and I informed him I had exhausted all my energy in trying to resolve this.</p>
<p>I also asked customer service to put a deposit limit on my account which was denied and I was told to do it in my online banking app. This is not acceptable and I know for a fact that a banking app can have a gambling block on the debit card yet transactions still go through because of the providers being used to accept payments. The majority of them not under the correctly category of gambling so visa and Mastercard blocks on debit cards mean nothing.</p>
<p>I have been playing these sites for over 13 years and have been conned so many times one wonders why I still play.</p>
<p>Well I joined the site as I was recovering from a cancer operation as explained to the Manager and I was continuous playing.</p>
<p>I was unable to sleep and so after a break from playing on any site I joined yummy.</p>
<p>He asked me to wait till Monday 10th October 2022 where he said he is phoning at 10am.</p>
<p>I feel absolutely bullied by this site, the effect on my mental health has been so detrimental that I was very near to suicide.</p>
<p>I know I have tried to the best of my ability to resolve this with the site to no avail.</p>
<p>Not only am I still waiting for my withdrawal but I am requesting every deposit back as the false information given to me stopped me making any further withdrawal.</p>
<p>STILL NO PAYMENT RECEIVED.</p>
<p>MORE EXCUSES EVERYDAY SAYING WAIT.</p>
