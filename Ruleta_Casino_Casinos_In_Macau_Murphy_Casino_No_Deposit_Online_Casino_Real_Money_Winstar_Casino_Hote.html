<p>The Denver Broncos suffered their third straight loss last Sunday when they lost to the Las Vegas Raiders at home. Their next opponent is a team that’s currently on a two-game losing streak.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Browns, however, had a tougher schedule than the Broncos, which explains why the bookmakers think of them as the favorite in the Thursday Night Football game.</p>

<p>The Broncos are Desperate to Stop Losing</p>
<p>The Broncos had a wonderful chance in Week 6 to beat the Raiders, whose new coach made his debut in that game. Unfortunately for Denver, everything seemed to go wrong for them on Sunday.</p>
<p>What’s worrying is that the same was the case in Week 5. That’s when we saw them losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers. In both of those games, they were seen as the pre-game favorite by the bookmakers.</p>
<p>Now, six weeks into the 2021 NFL season, the Broncos are 3-3, and their playoff dreams are slowly fading away. They’re in a very tough division, together with the Raiders, Chargers, and the Chiefs. Unless they up their form ASAP, they can say goodbye to the postseason.</p>
<p>The Browns Defense Needs to Toughen Up</p>
<p>This team conceded a total of 84 points in the previous two games. That’s just way too much for a team with playoff ambitions. The good thing, however, is that Cleveland’s poor defensive performances seem to be a glitch that should go away.</p>
<p>Before they entered the losing streak, the Browns won two straight games in which they conceded a total of just 13 games.</p>
<p>More good news is that in Round 7, they’re taking on the Broncos, a team that hasn’t been too impressive scoring-wise. In fact, with 126 points in six games, the Broncos’ offense should be relatively easy to handle for the Browns’ defense.</p>
<p>The real question is, how well is the Browns offense going to perform against one of the conference’s best defenses?</p>
<p>They should do reasonably well for several reasons. First of all, the Browns’ offense is superb, with Baker Mayfield as their QB and OBJ as a receiver. Although the two still haven’t clicked properly this season, everyone knows what they’re capable of.</p>
<p>There were some worries that Mayfield will not be able to play in Week 7 following shoulder problems, but according to the man himself, he’ll be there on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Another reason why Cleveland’s offense should deliver on Thursday is that the game is played at FirstEnergy Stadium, where they will have more than 67,000 fans to cheer them on.</p>
<p>Pick: Cleveland Browns to win and cover the spread; we should see over 43 points.</p>
