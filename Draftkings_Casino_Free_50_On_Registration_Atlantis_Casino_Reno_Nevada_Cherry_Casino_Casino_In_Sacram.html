    <h1>Draftkings Casino Free 50 On Registration Atlantis Casino Reno Nevada Cherry Casino Casino In Sacram</h1>

<p>Western Pennsylvania’s The Meadows Racetrack and Casino will be renamed and receive a new identity that gamblers will easily recognize. This casino is currently operated by the oldest gaming company in Pennsylvania – Penn National Gaming, which recently brought Barstool to the state.</p>
<p>Penn took control of Meadows back in 2018 by acquiring Pinnacle Entertainment. In 2014, Gaming and Leisure Properties, the real estate investment trust of Penn, purchased the physical assets of Meadows.</p>
<p>Three years after taking control, the operator has stated that it is time to add its ‘Hollywood identity’ and, to do that, the casino will be renamed.</p>
<p>The New Name of Meadows will be Hollywood Casino at The Meadows</p>
<p>While speaking with the Observer-Reporter, The Meadows’ vice president of marketing, Rahul Kaushik, stated that guests at the casino will find more than just a new name.</p>
<p>He stated that changing the name to Hollywood Casino at The Meadows has a deeper meaning. It has been a journey that started in 2019, and a key milestone in the process of rebranding as Hollywood Casino is Penn’s flagship brand.</p>
<p>Kaushik pointed out that there are many changes that are undergoing at the casino, including an updated H Lounge and a new sportsbook. Another major change includes the overhaul of The Eatery in late 2019, which is something that guests are yet to experience due to the pandemic. The Eatery houses five restaurants in one and the casino is home to six additional full-time restaurants.</p>
<p>Several Promotional Events Will Be Held</p>
<p>During the Hollywood implementation, The Meadows intends to host several promotional events. On Saturday, October 16, the casino will provide a total of $100,000 in prizes, with a Mercedes-Benz being the headliner.</p>
<p>Fireworks at dusk during the festivities will be present and local musicians, hourly prize drawings and food trucks will run from 2 PM -7 PM. Kaushik said that there are a lot of promotions behind the change of the property’s name and that the company wants to celebrate with the people and recognize those that got it this ahead.</p>
<p>During the pre-COVID-19 era, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board reported that The Meadows had $247 million in profits for the fiscal 2018/2019 year. The 3,000 slot machines were responsible for $211.95 million of the profit.</p>
<p>The total revenue ranked The Meadows 7th in the 12 casinos operating in the state during that period. Since then, the competition has increased, as there are 15 casinos operating. Not only that, but online casinos are also available for those that are older than 21.</p>
<p>Three of those 15 casinos in Pennsylvania are operated by Penn National. When Hollywood Casino Morgantown opens later this year, the total number will rise to four. The casinos that are already operated by Penn National are Hollywood Casino York, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, and The Meadows.</p>
<p>According to Kaushik, the rebranding of The Meadows to its signature Hollywood brand shows the company’s long-haul interest in the racetrack’s casino. He said that by putting its flagship, Penn National makes a statement that is here to stay.</p>
