<p>Genius Sports announced that it has expanded its partnership with PointsBet. As a result, PointsBet will be able to leverage Genius Sports’ official sports data, fan engagement and retention solutions.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Expands Collaboration with PointsBet</p>
<p>Sports data and technology provider Genius Sports announced a new supplier agreement with PointsBet, the online sports betting and gaming operator. The collaboration builds upon an existing agreement for content and streaming between the duo. Now, under this partnership expansion, PointsBet will receive access to Genius Sports’ full range of official sportsbook content, data, as well as fan engagement solutions for the NFL, EPL and NASCAR.</p>
<p>It was back in August when the NFL named PointsBet Approved Sportsbook Operator. Now, the company will be able to leverage Genius’ official sports betting data feed, NFL play-by-play statistics and use Next Gen Stats (NGS) data.</p>
<p>Genius offers official data which helps sportsbooks boost long-term player acquisition enabling unique pre-game and in-game betting options. Under the agreement, PointsBet will also be able to leverage that pre-game and in-play content and use Genius Sports’ fan engagement solutions for international and US sports such as NFL, NASCAR, NCAA, Argentine and Colombian soccer and the English Premier League.</p>
<p>Genius Adds Another Reliable Partner to Its Portfolio</p>
<p>Genius Sports’ CEO, Mark Locke shared his excitement about the partnership expansion with PointsBet. He outlined that the partnership reaffirms that official sports data has significant value and the ability to revolutionize sports betting experiences. Locke revealed that Genius is thrilled to expand its existing collaboration with PointsBet by providing the company with the “fastest, most accurate sports data available.”</p>
<p>“This partnership demonstrates the inherent value of official data and its ability to revolutionize the sports betting experience around the world.” Mark Locke, CEO of Genius Sports</p>
<p>On Monday this week, Genius announced a similar partnership with Hard Rock Digital. Under the collaboration, the company agreed to provide Hard Rock with official sports data and its leading sportsbook solutions. Before that, Genius expanded its collaboration with Entain and BetMGM.</p>
<p>PointsBet Remains Focused on Providing the Fast and Comprehensive Service</p>
<p>PointsBet USA’s CEO, Johnny Aitken, revealed that the company remains committed to providing the fastest and most comprehensive betting experience for sports fans. He acknowledged that the partnership expansion will undoubtedly boost PointsBet’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Although the company was founded in the well-shaped market in Australia, it quickly grew on the US sports betting scene. Currently, PointsBet operates in seven US states including the key markets in New Jersey, Michigan and Illinois. Additionally, the company provides its services for bettors in Iowa, Colorado, West Virginia and Iowa.</p>
<p>Unlike companies that use third parties for core functions, PointsBet relies on its technology end to end. Additionally, the company is proud that it can offer unmatched speed and ease for every customer along with pre-game and in-play wagering options.</p>
