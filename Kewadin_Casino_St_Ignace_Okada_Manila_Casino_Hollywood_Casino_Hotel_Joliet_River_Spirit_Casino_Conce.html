<p>Push Gaming: An innovative games provider with an eye on the future</p>
<p>Despite its low profile in the iGaming world, Push Gaming has been around since 2010 when it opened a studio in the creative hub of London. Since then it has steadily built a team of professionals, which the company claims is made up of expertise from all areas of the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Pointing to a focus on innovative gameplay and top-quality design and sound, Push Gaming appears to be an outward-looking enterprise, forming partnerships with some leading industry names. The firm also displays their games at big iGaming events such as ICE London, which demonstrates a high level of appeal for their games.</p>
<p>Their ambition as a company is clear: they recently acquired distributors GSI in a bid to expand their operations and they have their sights set on growth in Spain, Italy and Latin America.</p>
<p>In terms of licensing, the company holds a UK Remote Gambling Software License, certificates in Sweden and Denmark, as well as Malta and Alderney Supplier Licenses that are standard in the iGaming sector.</p>
