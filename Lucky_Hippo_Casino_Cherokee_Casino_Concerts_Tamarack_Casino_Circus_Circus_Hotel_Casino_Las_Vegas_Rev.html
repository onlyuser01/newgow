    <h1>Lucky Hippo Casino Cherokee Casino Concerts Tamarack Casino Circus Circus Hotel Casino Las Vegas Rev</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Would want to inform you (for moral reasons), that from inside info you should be wary of playing any regular casino games (that can not be actively verified on blockchain).</p>
<p>"TOPGAMETECHNOLOGY LTD" is company responsible for Evolution Gaming, Pragmatic Play and more are actively engaging with unfair play.</p>
<p>The modus operandi is to change outcome of bets on "casino level" to not endanger the license of the provider across the globe in various jurisdictions, however the providers are the main culprits in this case.</p>
<p>Any outcome can be 'skipped' simply by sending another "place bet" or "spin" signal and not showing the actual big win outcome, this can be tracked by google ads tracking but also many other various ways, like Cloudflare is assisting in this actively (and you will notice pretty much all providers being hosted in such) to bend and change the results of a game.</p>
<p>To keep the technical explaination short: you can consider the casino being a man in the middle to 'allow' the game results before actually showing to player.</p>
<p>In essence most (if not all) game providers have "opened" the fluid gate to later say "oops mistake" and fix, you can view however all admin panels from inside out where can be set a "max win. $" per slotmachine and much more.</p>
<p>The technical view of this quite simple and I've reproduced before to show what happens under the hood:</p>
<p>https://github.com/ryan-west-casino/scoobiedog</p>
<p>In addition to the above showing, also actually anyone can get 'access' to use games of any provider in same way as big brand casino's are doing (and also defrauding their shareholders) to get game results whilst not having to save in database of provider by using 'demo' (or 'funplay') game sessions and easily converting it to a 'realmoney session' (can be as simple by changing the denomation from "DEMO" to "$").</p>
<p>The proof that providers are actively making the games 'exploitable' (is a big word) is because of the game events that they actively send to the "iframe" parent window, you can view some of demo games using the github repository above on youtube:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkVUIg2ywgk</p>
<p>(this also shows all the client messages being sent to the parent window, this is to assist the casino in basically "blocking" outcomes and resending the "spin" or "place bet" event whilst players are unknowing)</p>
<p>I've uploaded ton of various papers at:</p>
<p>https://github.com/ryantci/info-tci</p>
<p>One of the screenshots of a random pdf:</p>
<p>[img]https://github.com/ryantci/info-tci/blob/main/_tci-documentatie-playtech-merkur/ezugi-casino-fraud-software.pdf-08.jpg?raw=true[/img]</p>
<p>And the backend (PHP) for Gammix systems (apart from being extremely poorly made, also completely illegal):</p>
<p>https://github.com/ryantci/gammix-backend</p>
<p>(gammix fined 1.4m per week, 4.4m final resolution:</p>
<p>https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/ksa-imposes-cease-and-desist-order-on-gammix/</p>
<p>https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/ksa-orders-gammix-to-pay-e4-4m-over-failure-to-cease-operations/</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>Also, most jurisdictions are also corrupt to the core, there are many examples in this (mainly in NL) but will come in next round whilst also being in talks with law enforcement here locally.</p>
