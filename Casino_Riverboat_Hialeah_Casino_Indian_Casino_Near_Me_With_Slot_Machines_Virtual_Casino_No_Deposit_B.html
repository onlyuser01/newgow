    <h1>Casino Riverboat Hialeah Casino Indian Casino Near Me With Slot Machines Virtual Casino No Deposit B</h1>

<p>Leading iGaming brand William Hill has entered into a partnership with Slot Factory, the B2B division of InTouch Games, a developer of products for the interactive casino vertical. As part of the agreement, William Hill will benefit from a range of new products – both existing and future – and add them to its own content offering for players across its network.</p>
<p>This means that William Hill will have access to established gaming products by Slot Factory, including Fabled Fortunes, Fruit Fighter, Super PrizePicket, Buffalo Gold, Cleopatra’s Steps, and others. Slot Factory is the author of more than 210 dedicated slot games that are the preferred choice for many established companies, including 888Casino, 1xBet, bwin, and others.</p>
<p>Slot Factory specified that it will first proceed with the launch of Big Blox Bonus, but then add more of its original slot games. This comes at an important juncture for the parent company which was bought out by Skywind Group last week.</p>
<p>Commenting on this content addition, William Hill Director of Gaming ContentCraig Staples said that the brand was excited to be adding the developer’s products to its own product offering. He commended the dedication and commitment that has gone into developing each individual title and welcomed the in-house approach Slot Factory had been using to create games.</p>
<p>As such, Slot Factory is one of the best content partners for the UK market. Slot Factory’s in-house development process includes trials on dedicated B2C websites owned by the company, which gives the company an edge over the competition in establishing what specific tweaks need to be made to reach more people and seek better engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Slot Factory Head of CommercialCharles Mott said that the company was determined to continue delivering stellar content to customers and that William Hill shared those values. Slot Factory has been looking to expand its reach in the gaming space and ensure that it has more partners that the company can provide content to.</p>
<p>At the end of April, Slot Factory confirmed that it had sealed a similar content distribution partnership with MrQ, a B2C website. Slot Factory has enjoyed sustained and scalable growth over the past months resulting in a strong financial year. Slot Factory has shown a particular determination towards the UK market that it now seeks to build upon in its latest tie-up with William Hill.</p>
