<p>Hey! This applies to Tornadobet Casino. (Not in your drop-down list)</p>
<p>This week on Monday, October 28, I won money on Tornadobet.com. I chose to make a withdrawal via Visa, because I previously made deposits via my Visa card. I would like to point out that on their page under the tab "withdrawal method" it says under the Visa function withdrawals Max 5000 euros, which of course means withdrawals Max 5000 euros.</p>
<p>My amount (withdrawal) was SEK 34,000.</p>
<p>I'm waiting but no one hears from me by email. I assume that the reason why no one hears is that I have previously made a withdrawal and then gone through the entire verification process with passport, proof of address, Visa card and bank account. Then I got my money without any problems, and the whole process took only 3 days.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, October 29, I see that all the money has ended up in my gaming account again. I then contact the chat and question why the money is back in the account. I then get the answer that the limit for withdrawals is 1500 euros. I find this strange because it is clearly stated under the tab withdrawals and the option Show that the maximum withdrawal is 5000 euros.</p>
<p>I am told that I can make three withdrawals, to divide the profit.</p>
<p>Of course, I do this the same day, just a few minutes after I talked to the chat.</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 1, I see that the money is back in my gaming account.</p>
<p>I find it strange that no one contacted me via Mail to explain the reason why the money is reinstated in the gaming account.</p>
<p>I get back in touch with the chat, and then I get information that my bank has refused to accept Tornadobet's transfer. I was surprised, because I have never been with a bank refusing to accept a deposit. It has worked before, so then it should work now as well. I get even more desperate when no one from Tornadobet has made any attempt to contact me about this via Mail.</p>
<p>I then chose to make new withdrawals.</p>
<p>On October 1, I choose to withdraw three amounts and then via Bank Transfer. Today I have two banks, so I choose the withdrawals at each bank to see if Tornadobet uses the same argument. For what is the probability that both my banks will refuse to accept the transfer?</p>
<p>The amounts have remained since 1 October, one at 1400 euros, one at 1000 euros, and the third at 319 euros.</p>
<p>When I did this, I was contacted by KYC via Mail, to verify me regarding my other bank, and was notified on October 1 that the verification was approved and complete.</p>
<p>Then I took the opportunity to ask when my money would be paid out, and then get the answer that the first payment will be sent on October 2, my second withdrawal will be sent on October 5 and my third withdrawal will be sent on October 7. One may wonder why my withdrawals should be sent at these intervals?</p>
<p>I also asked the question of how I can ensure that the money is actually sent away on these specified dates, and then get the answer that I will see that my withdrawals disappear under the tab "withdrawals".</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 2nd of October and all withdrawals remain in my account. I then contacted the chat and was told that there was a note that my money (first withdrawal) would be sent on October 2 and that they could not answer more than that it was in progress. I then had to settle for that answer.</p>
<p>Today is the 3rd of October. All three withdrawals are still in my gaming account. I contacted the chat again and was then told that the first withdrawal should be sent today.</p>
<p>I'm tired of getting the wrong information about my withdrawals. I think they're hoping I'm canceling my withdrawals and playing everything, but I'll definitely not do that!</p>
<p>I have not saved all the chats, but I have saved the email from Tornadobet where they promised me these dates given above. How serious is this company?</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is a maximum limit on withdrawals for Visa and Bank Transfer written at 5,000 euros, which they do not follow themselves, and on the other hand, it is also their message that payment will be made, which they do not follow at all.</p>
<p>Is this entirely possible?</p>
