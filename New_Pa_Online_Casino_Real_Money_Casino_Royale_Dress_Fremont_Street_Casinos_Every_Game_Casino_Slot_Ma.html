<p>Booongo’s dedicated games will be coming to the websites of Virtualsoft partner operators across the Latin American region.</p>
<p>Booongo Gets a LatAm Boost through Virtualsoft Partnership</p>
<p>Virtualsoft will offer partners access to Booongo games, a prominent developer of slots titles, as part of a new distribution deal both companies struck to continue their push across the Latin American market.</p>
<p>Booongo is bringing a select variety of innovative slot games along with the high-quality Hold and Win games that are now grabbing headlines at multiple casinos. Virtualsoft will offer games such as Dragon Pearls, Beast Saga, and Aztec Saga.</p>
<p>To make sure that its games are well-received, Booongo will provide interested parties with a variety of gamification tools including tournaments and numerous enhanced jackpots to improve upon player retention and engagement, and lead to better bottom-line results for partner businesses as well as provide consumers with a better, more streamlined experience.</p>
<p>Booongo has been actively building up and expanding its footprint in key markets worldwide, including Europe and Asia, and not least Latin America. Commenting on the latest tie-up, Boongo commercial director Sebastian Damian welcomed the move and added:</p>
<p>“With a well-established network based in Latin America, our deal with Virtualsoft aligns strongly with our desire to reinforce our footing in the region.”</p>
<p>Builidng across the Region with Valuable Partners</p>
<p>Damian welcomed Virtualsoft’s drive to provide clients with affordable solutions and suit each operator’s unique needs and preferences. Booongo is eager to see what opportunities the partnership would present for the supplier, Damian argued.</p>
<p>Virtualsoft CTO Jose Luis Osorio shared a similar sentiment, welcoming the opportunity to work closely with Boongo and provide its collection of slot games to interested parties. Osorio is confident that the Hold and Win titles will lead to high interest among regional players.</p>
<p>“We are excited to bring Booongo into our growing network of partners,” Osorio concluded. Booongo has been very busy in the Latin American region of late. Last week, the company signed a partnership with aggregation platform provider Emara Play.</p>
<p>Booongo negotiated a similar platform deal in February with Dotworkers, once again covering the LatAm market.</p>
