    <h1>Casinos Miami The Mill Casino Casino In Chicago Luxor Casino Hollywood Casino Lithuanian Authority F</h1>

<p>The Gambling Supervisory Authority in Lithuania has issued a €15,000 ($14,437) fine to TOPsport UAB for breaching Part 3 of the Gambling Law. According to the regulator’s findings, the operator failed to correctly install and use the necessary digital video recording systems at two retail sports betting venues in Klaipeda. The decision is not final and can be appealed by the operator.</p>
<p>The Authority’s investigation showed that the video surveillance systems that the operator had installed at two of its two locations in Klaipeda failed to capture and record the premises in a correct and accurate manner. At one of the locations, the surveillance system that was installed to capture images of all patrons setting foot inside the sports betting venue did not fulfill its purpose. The images were blurry and the recorded images were of no use as they did not allow the clear identification of all the persons who had previously visited the shop.</p>
<p>Also, at both of the betting shops that were under investigation, the gaming regulator discovered the recording systems in place were not able to capture footage of the financial transactions that took place. In other words, the money that went in and out of each of these venues could not be identified.</p>
<p>According to the Lithuanian regulator, this was in breach of Part 3 of the Gambling Law of Lithuania which clearly states all video recordings need to show all the people entering a betting venue, along with their betting actions, together with the bookmaker’s related activities.</p>
<p>TOPsport Was Also Fined for Breaching a Ban on Gambling Promotion</p>
<p>TOPsport UAB has the right to appeal the regulator’s decision. Earlier this year, the operator received another fine for allegedly breaching the county’s ban on gambling promotions. The company received a $24,000 fine in May as a result of a 2021 investigation from the same Authority that discovered the operator had posted a series of claims on its online platform that were allegedly encouraging people website visitors to engage in gambling.</p>
<p>As the pioneer betting company to enter Lithuania in 2002, TOPsport is currently the most successful betting business in the country. Over the years, the operator turned into one of the largest leisure spaces endowed with modern-day features, as well as the most successful online betting platform preferred by Lithuanians. Right now, the company counts 60+ sports betting locations in 26 towns, along with 50 slot machine venues. In Mid-August, ParlayBay signed a partnership with TOPsport, offering its entire sports betting portfolio to the Lithuanian operator.</p>
