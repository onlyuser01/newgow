<p>Dear Casino Guru and Andrew bartolini</p>
<p>We appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention.</p>
<p>On the case of self-exclusion and deposit limit - please note that request was received from the player. Not by email nor by chat.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions of the casino clearly state "17.1-3. . For those customers who wish to restrict their gambling, we provide voluntary self-exclusion tools, which enable you to close your account or restrict your ability to place bets. If you require any information relating to this facility please contact Customer Support. We will endeavor to implement your request within a reasonable time period and to ensure compliance with your self-exclusion. However you accept that we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if you continue gambling before your request has been implemented or you seek to use the Website and we fail to recognize or determine that. You acknowledge that exclusion and limits are set per account, and should you have accounts on more than one site owned by us, you must set the limits on each account." https://www.spicyspins.com/general-terms-conditions/?lang=en</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal delay, we see that the withdrawal request on January 2020, was successfully paid and Andrew had confirmed the receipt of the funds.</p>
<p>We can confirm that Andrew has a recent withdrawal of 900 which was finalised and the payment request was sent to the payment processor.</p>
<p>For further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Spicy Spins Casino</p>
