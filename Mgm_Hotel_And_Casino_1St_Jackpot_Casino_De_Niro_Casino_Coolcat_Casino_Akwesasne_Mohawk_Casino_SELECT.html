    <h1>Mgm Hotel And Casino 1St Jackpot Casino De Niro Casino Coolcat Casino Akwesasne Mohawk Casino SELECT</h1>

<p>Hello Tomas,</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt response to my previous email and for your cooperation. I apologize for any misunderstanding that may have occurred. I would like to draw your attention to the attached documents, which clearly show the self-exclusion actions I initiated.</p>
<p>On November 2, 2022, I personally initiated a self-exclusion on Thrillsy. This was followed by another self-exclusion on November 6, 2022, on Silverplay. Furthermore, on December 14, 2022, I self-excluded myself from Dachbet, and on January 5, 2023, I carried out a self-exclusion from Betonic where all this stated casino's projects operated by Bellona N.V.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that all of these self-exclusion actions were done through direct contact with the customer support of the respective platforms. I will also provide you with the chat transcripts as proof via email, which may be in either German or English.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, I have provided you with confirmation of my self-exclusion from the casino projects operated by Bellona N.V.</p>
<p>However, to my surprise, I discovered that I was not excluded from Select.bet. I was able to create an account using the same personal information and username. Therefore, despite the measures taken to prevent a relapse, it appears that the system's effectiveness was compromised.</p>
<p>I firmly believed that my self-exclusion measures would cover all platforms under the umbrella of Bellona N.V. including Select.bet. However, the fact that I was able to create an account with Select.bet using the same details indicates a flaw in their system, rendering the preventive measures ineffective. Regarding Bellona N.V. as corporate i want to add you an extreme important information.</p>
<p>Bellona N.V. operates a total of 9 casinos, and to the best of my recollection, I have self-excluded myself from 5 of them. It is really concerning to discover that I am not self-excluded from the remaining 4 casinos included Select.bet and this raises alarms regarding the effectiveness of the self-exclusion system implemented by Bellona N.V.</p>
<p>So to raise my complaint i didn't directly contacted select.bet because, upon conducting a search in the Cura√ßao Chamber of Commerce register, I discovered that Emoore is the managing entity under registration number 120860. Therefore, I lodged my complaint directly with them. I have attached the entire complaint I sent for your reference. Please note that this information is also mentioned on all casinos of Bellona N.V. including select.bet casino website at the bottom of the website where the licence logo is marked.</p>
<p>In their response, the emoore entity stated that the identifiers I provided, such as my name and date of birth, may not be considered unique by the operator's system. They claimed that it is possible for completely different individuals to have the same name and date of birth, which could restrict their registration if they were unfortunate enough to share that information with someone already excluded. Statistically speaking, this scenario seems highly improbable. So they refused to initiate a refund of my deposits as you might already saw in the document attached in my last email.</p>
<p>I'm really reaching out here to seek your assistance in obtaining a refund for my deposits, as I have experienced significant injustice. Your support in this matter is highly appreciated, as it represents my final attempt to resolve the issue amicably before considering legal action and involving my lawyer. I would like to express my gratitude in advance for any help you can provide. Additionally, please be assured that I am available to provide any further documents you may require.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
