    <h1>Best Online Casino Games Casino In Long Island Hotel River Rock Casino Vancouver Casino Yuma Az Tach</h1>

<p>Yolo Group, a cryptocurrency-focused gaming operator, announced that it has restructured its operations and made a significant investment into its Hub88 content aggregation platform, seeking to introduce open-banking to its clients.</p>
<p>Open-Banking Functionality</p>
<p>The investment into Yolo Group’s Hub88 platform made via Yolo Investments aims to speed up growth at the platform and eventually offer its B2B partners open-banking capabilities provided by Aims Financial, an invested asset of Yolo Investments regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>
<p>As part of the restructuring, Yolo Group tapped former chief commercial officer of Pariplay Christine Lewis. She will be the CEO of the vertically-integrated business formed between mobile-focused games studio OneTouch, live casino product brand Bombay Club and the Hub88 content aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Lewis, who also served at NetEnt in the past, commented, “I’ve watched the remarkable growth of Yolo Group over the past few years with interest. Hub88, OneTouch and more recently the Bombay Club live studio are changing the game with new approaches to old challenges. It’s a real honor to join the team.”</p>
<p>Her experience at some of the biggest names in our industry stands her apart, and she’s exactly the type of disruptive thinker we welcome at the Yolo Group. It’s great to have her onboard.” Maarja Pärt, CEO, Yolo Group</p>
<p>The restructuring of operations follows hot in the footsteps of the recently announced rebranding at the crypto-focused gaming operator, formerly known as Coingaming Group, to rename the operator behind Sportsbet.io and Bitcasino.io as Yolo Group.</p>
<p>Alongside the rebranding, Yolo Group announced ambitions to operate on multiple fronts, uniting under its umbrella Yolo Investments, Yolo Entertainment, Yolo Ventures, Yolo Tech and Yolo Finance, with each of these divisions focused on a particular area.</p>
<p>Other Personnel Reshuffling</p>
<p>Yolo Group announced the ongoing restructuring of the business will see other changes in personnel like Ragnar Toompere, acting head of OneTouch gaming studio, who will join the board at Yolo Ventures, the vertical focused on B2B projects, while Jose Micallef will join as chief operations officer of the division.</p>
<p>Neil Howells will be tasked to leverage his previous coordination experience at Bombay Studios and assume commercial management responsibilities at Bombay Group, while James Corrie will continue to provide project oversight as head of Live Studios.</p>
<p>We’re putting into place a world-class team to take our B2B gaming businesses to the next level, and Christine is a vital part of it.” Maarja Pärt, CEO, Yolo Group</p>
