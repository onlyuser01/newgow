    <h1>The Linq Hotel Casino Casino Tequila Limitless Casino Log In Casino In Nashville Tennessee Red Rock</h1>

<p>Commercial gaming supplier AGS announced yesterday it acquired a provisional iGaming supplier license by the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) to provide proven and engaging online gaming content to state licensed operators.</p>
<p>“We are excited about being awarded our provisional iGaming license in Michigan and look forward to helping the state launch its new iGaming program.” Matt Reback, Executive Vice President, AGS</p>
<p>Ready to Offer Engaging Content</p>
<p>As soon as the Wolverine State approves online casino games, which is expected to happen either by the end of 2020 or in early 2021, AGS will be able to supply its proprietary games to Michigan’s legal iGaming operators.</p>
<p>Utilizing its powerful Remote Gaming Server, AGS will offer its content which already proved its value in land-based gaming facilities online, to help online gaming companies further engage with customers by providing them the gaming thrill they expect.</p>
<p>“We are confident that Michigan is going to be a strong market for us, with three commercial casinos that cater to a repeat player base, and player familiarity with AGS games due to the popularity and longevity of our land-based games in the Michigan market.” Matt Reback, Executive Vice President, AGS</p>
<p>AGS robust library with high-performing game titles such as Capital Gains®, Fu Nan Fu Nu®, Golden Wins®, Jade Wins®, Longhorn Jackpots™, and Rakin’ Bacon!®, will further increase the offering of online gaming operators in the state and empower them to deliver an exceptional play experience.</p>
<p>Content from the gaming supplier is already present across online platforms in regulated markets in Europe and Latin America. In the US, AGS’ content is live in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and entering Michigan is set to mark a further expansion for the gaming content provider. AGS’ AxSys™ Games Marketplace platform allows its world online casino partners to gain access to AGS gaming content, as well as engaging games provided by third parties.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a panel of lawmakers in Michigan agreed to fast-track the regulatory framework for the launch of online sports betting and iGaming in the state by the end of December. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR) waived the 15-day requirement for rules review with regards to the proposed set of rules by the MGCB.</p>
<p>The state regulator spent most of the first half of 2020 crafting the regulatory rules and the decision by the committee will allow their adoption by the end of the year.</p>
