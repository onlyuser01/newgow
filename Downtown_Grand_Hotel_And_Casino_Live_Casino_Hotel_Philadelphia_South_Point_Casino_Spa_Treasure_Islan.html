<p>M88 Mansion has signed a new brand ambassador partnership with Ivan Rakitić, Sevilla FC midfielder, who will be an official representative for the Asian online gaming company during the 2022-23 LaLiga Santander Season.</p>
<p>Ivan Rakitić to Drive LaLiga Awareness for M88 Mansion</p>
<p>The partnership marks the latest attempt by M88 Mansion to connect with global sporting audiences, bringing prominent athletes under its roof to represent the operator. The Croatian superstar makes a perfect addition to M88 Mansion’s already strong lineup of names.</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunity, Rakitić said that he was excited to be joining M88 Mansion and helping the brand connect with more fans. He also added that meeting with Asian fans from all around the world and thanked M88 for the opportunity. M88 Mansion head of commercial Alan Wafer was similarly pleased to see the soccer ace become a part of the company’s family and represent the operator in LaLiga. Wafer said:</p>
<p>We are delighted to have Ivan Rakitić become part of our family. At the same time, this strengthens our relationship with LaLiga, one of our biggest partners to date. M88 Mansion head of commercial Alan Wafer</p>
<p>Rakitić is no random choice either as he has been playing in Spain since 2011. He has been part of the Sevilla FC family since 2014, bar a hiatus he took to transfer to FC Barcelona, but returned back to his original Spanish club in 2020.</p>
<p>M88 has a long history of teaming up with prominent names from the world of sports. The operator has managed to sign Steven Gerrard, a famed soccer player, ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and the company similarly teamed up with Manny “PacMan” Pacquiao, a prominent boxer.</p>
<p>M88 has put a big emphasis on bringing more popular athletes and names from the world of sports as ambassadors in Asia where the brand is gathering momentum and where fans recognize many of the names that the company has been signing up to represent it.</p>
