    <h1>Seneca Allegany Resort Casino Casino In Murphy North Carolina Isle Bettendorf Casino Golden Heart Ca</h1>

<p>RAS Technology Holdings, the Australian company that powers Racing and Sports has announced a $5-million extension to its current contract with Entain. RAS will offer fresh thoroughbred content from important racing jurisdictions, together with global greyhounds’ live feeds and analytic data. Entain recently appointed Shailendra Maurya as Ladbrokes Coral’s chief technology officer.</p>
<p>Entain Will Use RAS’ Content Across Its Australian Brands</p>
<p>The deal will allow the FTSE100-listed gaming betting and gaming company to use RAS’ racing content across its brands in Australia. The list includes Neds, Ladbrokes, Bookmaker, and Betstar. Entain will also benefit from RAS’ Global Ratings framework. This framework is used by the company’s trading divisions to generate pricing feeds and mathematical models.</p>
<p>The chief executive officer for Entain Australia Dean Shannon recognized Racing and Sports’ proven reliability and consistency as a “provider of high-quality data and live feeds”. He added that taking their partnership to a new level would, therefore, make “complete sense”. Shannon also commented that Entain Australia “prides itself” on being focused on customers, while expressing the importance of offering the freshest and most accurate information in formats that are easy to access. Entain’s CEO also spoke about RAS’ “strong heritage” in the industry, aligned with its continuous interest in innovation and enhancement. Shannon added that the two elements perfectly mirrored Entain’s vision.</p>
<p>The agreement is the last in a long row of important partnerships that RAS managed to secure in the fast-expanding sports betting market in the US. Among them, we can mention the new XB Net and Sky Racing partnerships.</p>
<p>RAS, Thrilled to Secure a Long-Term Deal With Entain</p>
<p>RAS’ chief executive officer Stephen Crispe welcomed the fresh agreement, expressing the company’s thrill for securing a long-term partnership with Entain. Crispe also spoke about players’ increased appetite for innovative data on thoroughbreds, greyhounds, and harness racing. He explained that RAS managed to “independently collate historical data from all corners of the world” in the past few years. The respective data is now helpful for traditional bettors, while also showing its appeal for new or casual bettors. Crispe also spoke about the group’s international growth, mentioning the new deal with SBC News. He also disclosed that Europe, the United Kingdom, and emerging gaming markets in Asia and the US represented the company’s main targets.</p>
<p>Speaking about Australia, he expressed confidence that the racing market in the area was “arguably the most mature of any on the planet’, while mentioning the emerging trend of a younger audience expressing its interest in horse racing.RAS signed an important long-term partnership with UK’s Greyhound Board of Great Britain. At the beginning of July, Entain announced a slowdown in its online net gaming revenue in H1 and Q2.</p>
