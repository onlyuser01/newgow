<p>Thunderkick, the Swedish developer of innovative and cutting-edge online casino games such as Midas Golden Touch, Bones &amp; Bounty, Grand Melec, and others, has expanded in the Romanian market through a partnership with Skywind Group.</p>
<p>This collaboration will allow the studio to directly inject its games into the market and bring Hellapenos and Hot Potato, among other noteworthy options to local players through Skywind’s established casino brands, Princess Casino and Luck.com.</p>
<p>The Romanian iGaming market has proven of particular interest to companies over the past several months. Many companies, including other innovative suppliers and developers such as Octoplay and Soft2Bet, have broken ground in the local market, strengthening their overall European footprint.</p>
<p>Now, Thunderkick has the opportunity to do just the same. Thunderkick Head of Sales FredrikEkholm has spoken highly of the opportunity to see this partnership come to fruition and said that the market is indeed a prime target for the company’s further expansion moves.</p>
<p>"Skywind Group is a leader in Romania with a reputation for delivering standout gameplay experiences, and we’re confident that customers will enjoy diving into what we have to offer," Ekholm has said.</p>
<p>Skywind Group Head of CRM Daniela Asaftei was similarly pleased with this opportunity, hailing the chance to work closely with a leading supplier and strengthen the group’s brand libraries.</p>
<p>"This partnership allows us to offer even more innovative, next-level games to our partnered operators, strengthening our brand whilst also allowing Thunderkick to grow even further in a key market," Asaftei wrapped up.</p>
<p>Thunderkick has been naturally growing elsewhere, with the company showing no signs of or intention to slow down. The supplier has teamed up with Rush Street Interactive’s Rushbet and introduced its portfolio of games in Mexico.</p>
<p>To guarantee that its games reach by wider audiences, Thunderkick also pursued growth through strategic aggregation integrations designed to elevate the company’s profile and help it strike home with more people. The latest involves Alea Play, an aggregation solution, that now features Thunderkick’s games and shares them with its partners.</p>
<p>Not least, Thunderkick has been working in its local market, providing content for the likes of Fastbet and Bethard.</p>
