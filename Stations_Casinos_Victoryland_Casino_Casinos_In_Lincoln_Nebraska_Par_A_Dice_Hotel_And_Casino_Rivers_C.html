    <h1>Stations Casinos Victoryland Casino Casinos In Lincoln Nebraska Par A Dice Hotel And Casino Rivers C</h1>

<p>Dear nathanstevensjames,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your negative experience with Damslots Casino.</p>
<p>I checked the terms and conditions of the casino and found this:</p>
<p>"VERIFICATION OF YOUR IDENTITY (KYC)/ MONEY LAUNDERING</p>
<p>Account must be activated through the Welcome email and KYC verified by uploading the following documents:</p>
<p>Coloured Photocopy/Picture of your ID card, Passport or Driver's License. We need to see your full name, D.O.B and Expiry Date; Real-time photo ( "selfie" ) while holding the front and back sides of the document you chose, under your chin; Coloured Photocopy/Picture/Screenshot of a recent Utility bill / Bank statement (no older than 3 months) showing the issue date, your name, address and the company logo; To upload the documents, please log into your Account and go to My Account &gt; Profile Details &gt; ID Documents. Under "Upload new Documents" you can choose the file with the necessary documentation to upload. Alternatively you can send an email to our Customer Support."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, under no circumstances can we argue to the casino an expired passport should be accepted as a valid document for verification, thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you attempted to submit all of these documents for verification? With what result?</p>
<p>Did casino support offer any specific recommendations for you in order to complete the KYC verification?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
