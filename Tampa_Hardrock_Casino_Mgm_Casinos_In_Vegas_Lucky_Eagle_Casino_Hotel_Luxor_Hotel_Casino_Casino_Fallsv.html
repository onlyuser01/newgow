<p>While negotiations for new five-year contracts with downtown and Strip operators continue, picket lines may be seen ahead of Super Bowl early in February</p>
<p>Super Bowl LVIII, one of the most-anticipated National Football League (NFL) events for the year, is scheduled to take place on February 11, 2024, at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. While there are plenty of festive activities planned throughout the week before the game, Sin City visitors may see hospitality worker picket lines in front of downtown and Strip hotel casinos.</p>
<p>Last week, the Culinary Union, representing casino workers in the city successfully negotiated a new five-year contract for the employees at Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas. While this was a major success for the union and the workers, negotiations with 20 hotel casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown continue and picket lines may be seen.</p>
<p>In a recent interview for The Nevada Independent, Ted Pappageorge, the Culinary Union’s secretary-treasurer, confirmed that picket lines can be seen in front of the properties just in time for the Super Bowl LVIII celebrations planned early in February. Pappageorge reaffirmed the need for a deadline, something that was announced by the Culinary Union earlier this month. At the time, the Union set February 2 at 5 AM as the deadline for the negotiations with the remaining 20 downtown and Strip hotel casinos.</p>
<p>Hospitality Employees Are Prepared to Go On Strike</p>
<p>Pappageorge spoke about the importance of the new contracts with the outstanding casino hotels, explaining that the workers there deserve the same benefits as the deals negotiated with the major operators in Sin City. He revealed that February 2 represents exactly nine months since the contracts of the hospitality workers expired.</p>
<p>While Pappageorge confirmed that the Unions want to avoid a strike, he said that “any responsible labor leader is going to do their best to reserve that right.” He confirmed that the workers at the resorts where contracts are outstanding are prepared to go on strike to secure better conditions, fair wages and job benefits.</p>
<p>“At the same time, these companies need to know things have changed since the pandemic. These companies are doing well and workers want their fair share and they’re prepared to strike to achieve that goal.“ Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union</p>
<p>Last year, the Union reached agreements for new five-year contracts with Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts, the three leading casino and entertainment operators in Las Vegas. Recognized as a major win, the negotiations secured better working conditions, increased pay and job security for some 40,000 employees in the sector.</p>
