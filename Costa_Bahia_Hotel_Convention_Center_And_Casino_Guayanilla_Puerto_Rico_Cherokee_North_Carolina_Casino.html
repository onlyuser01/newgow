<p>It seems that the major CS:GO update, Operation Broken Fang, introduced a new bug along with the new agents, skins, and maps. Revealed by Na’Vi Junior player Ilya “m0NESY“ Osipov, the dynamic ping system bug tips players if opposing team players walk over the ping marker.</p>
<p>Dynamic Ping System in CS:GO Introduces a Major Bug</p>
<p>CS:GO Operation Broken Fang was introduced early in December. The major update brought new agents, a new game mode, skins, maps, and the new “Dynamic Ping System”. With the help of the new system, players can communicate with each other by sending messages and pointing a location on their map to their team.</p>
<p>However, the new system may need a bit of fixing as it has introduced a rather game-breaking bug to CS:GO. The bug was only recently discovered by Na’Vi Junior player Ilya “m0NESY“ Osipov.</p>
<p>Once a player pings a location on the map and then an enemy player walks over it, the ping changes, thus revealing the location of the enemy player. In other words, players can use the ping system to their advantage by knowing when the enemy player is approaching, which is similar wallhacks.</p>
<p>Quite a critical bug with the in-game ping system showed on @m0NESY13's stream, whenever an enemy player walks into your visual ping symbol on screen it gives an indication that they're there @CSGO</p>

<p>In its video, posted on Twitter, m0NESY reveals how the ping changes once the enemy player walks over it. As a result, this bug gives a slight advantage to the players by allowing them to hold safer angels and eliminating the element of surprise when an enemy player is approaching.</p>
<p>Further Use of the Dynamic Ping Bug</p>
<p>If this sounds like a bug that gives only a slight advantage to the players, further experiments by CS:GO players showed that the dynamic ping can also stick to objects and travel with them. In other words, if the bomb is dropped by the T-team, the CT-team players can ping the bomb and once the bomb is picked up by a T-player, the ping travels along revealing the location to the CT-team.</p>
<p>For the moment, it is unknown how many players have used the bug and whether any professional CS:GO players have used it to their advantage. With that in mind, Valve may need to fix this urgently in order to avoid an escalation such as the one with the “Spectator Bug”. The spectator bug allowed CS:GO coaches to have a “free camera” giving them a view to any location of the map during tournaments.</p>
<p>Once the bug was discovered, the Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC) launched a massive investigation on the topic and vowed to go through tournament demos as far back as in 2016. As a result, the Commission revealed that it banned more than 30 CS:GO coaches over the use of the exploit in September.</p>
