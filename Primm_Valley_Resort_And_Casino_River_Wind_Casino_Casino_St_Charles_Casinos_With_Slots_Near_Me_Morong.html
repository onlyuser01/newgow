<p>The company's temporary sportsbook at Silverton Casino Lodge is scheduled to open on January 1, while its permanent venue is expected to open in March</p>
<p>Circa Sports, a fast-growing sportsbook, confirmed its plans to open its newest location at the start of the new year. The company confirmed that its new sportsbook located in southwest Las Vegas at the Silverton Casino Lodge is expected to open soon. Initially, Circa will open a temporary sportsbook on January 1, 2024, located near Shady Grove Bar and Lounge.</p>
<p>This temporary sportsbook is expected to offer four TV screens displaying odds, as well as two betting windows. Sports fans and bettors alike can place wagers via two self-service betting kiosks. Similar to other sportsbooks, Circa promises to deliver exceptional entertainment and engaging experiences.</p>
<p>The temporary sportsbook will operate every day between 8 AM and 9 PM. Its launch comes at a time when Circa is preparing for the launch of its permanent sportsbook at Silverton Casino. The permanent location which is currently undergoing renovation is expected to open its doors to visitors in March. Ideally, Circa hinted at plans to open the permanent sportsbook ahead of March Madness.</p>
<p>The company said that the permanent betting venue at Silverton Casino Lodge is expected to take up some 1,600 square feet of space. It is planned to offer three self-serving betting kiosks, as well as three betting windows. Moreover, the permanent sportsbook will offer boards with odds, along with 22 bar top games, a dozen lounge chairs, as well as tables and booths that accommodate parties of six and four.</p>
