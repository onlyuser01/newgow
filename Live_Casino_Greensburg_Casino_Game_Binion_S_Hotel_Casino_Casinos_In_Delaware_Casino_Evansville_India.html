    <h1>Live Casino Greensburg Casino Game Binion S Hotel Casino Casinos In Delaware Casino Evansville India</h1>

<p>MaximBet has revealed its first free-to-play platform, MaximBet Play. The betting platform is developed in collaboration between Carousel Group, a leading sports betting and online casino brand, and Maxim, a lifestyle brand.</p>
<p>MaximBet Play drives on the technological nous of Splash Tech, a specialist in the development of games and mobile solutions. As a result, the MaximBet Play app allows consumers to engage with the brand and access a variety of different prizes that are offered by MaximBet and require no payment whatsoever.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release, MaximBet is going ahead and launching a free-to-play promotion for the college bowl season, looking to help consumers explore MaximBet Play and benefit from the experience as they go along. The MaximBet “Crystal Bowl” game will ask consumers to try and predict the results of the 25 college bowl games that will start on December 28.</p>
<p>Just in Time for College Bowl Season</p>
<p>There will be a number of proposition bets that bettors can try their luck at. The promotion will run through January 10 when all participants will stand to win a piece of the $10,000 prize pool for the event. MaximBet CPO Josh Littin commented on the launch of the Play platform and the promotion that goes hand-in-hand with it:</p>
<p>“There is nothing better than college football bowl season and MaximBet is taking things to a whole new level this year with the launch of MaximBet Play and our Crystal Bowl game.” MaximBet CPO Josh Littin</p>
<p>Littin is confident that the new free-to-play app will bring fans precisely what they expect and allow them to appreciate the MaximBet brand better. Bettors are about to “lose their minds” when they see what the brand has to offer, Littin adds.</p>
<p>The F2P solution is also an opportunity for MaximBet to reach customers in markets where the brand is not yet live. Apart from the college bowl events, consumers will be able to use MaximBet Play to tap into a number of free contests and place selections on the outcome of various sporting events.</p>
<p>There will be leaderboards with various prize pools and rewards for participants to look forward to. Those prizes can vary from cash rewards to luxury goods, to what MaximBet describes as “money-can’t-buy-experiences” in their official press release. One such possible experience is the MaximBet Big Game party in Los Angeles in February.</p>
<p>MaximBet Continues to Post Strong Performance</p>
<p>Commenting on the release, Splash Tech CEO Adam Wilson argued that both companies believe in the delivery of the best possible gaming experience for the end-customer.</p>
<p>“We think sports fans will agree MaximBet Play is everything they’ve been looking for in a free-to-play platform. Nobody is more focused on the user experience than MaximBet, and MaximBet Play offers the best bets on the biggest games with the coolest prizes, absolutely free.” Splash Tech CEO Adam Wilson</p>
<p>Overall, MaximBet has been able to stay on track with its stated goals this year and reinvigorated the industry because of its connection with the lifestyle brand, leading to fresh experiences for all.</p>
<p>MaximBet has reported a double-digit growth of its revenue on a monthly basis since it launched and the platform continues to build up its product and offer in a bid to secure more ground with fans across the United States, North America, and possibly beyond.</p>
<p>MaximBet has been able to secure numerous entries and market access partnerships over the last months, including Arizona, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and not least Colorado.</p>
