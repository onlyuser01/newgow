<p>The new content launch further strengthened Bragg's presence with Caesars in the Garden State</p>
<p>Supplier of online casino content and technology Bragg Gaming announced that its footprint in New Jersey has expanded via a launch with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Strengthen Ties with the ‘Iconic Caesars Brand’</p>
<p>The launch of Bragg Gaming’s new content and Remote Game Server (RGS) technology with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino in New Jersey will see proprietary titles such as Egyptian Magic, Fairy Dust and the Girl with the Golden Eyes become available to Caesars customers in the state.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Yaniv Sherman, chief executive officer of Bragg Gaming Group, hailed the popularity of the “iconic Caesars brand” that is associated “with the very best in casino gaming entertainment in the US,” happy to build further on the long-standing relationship with the prominent brand ‘by extending the reach of these new games” to Caesars players in the Garden State.</p>
<p>“This launch is an important step for us, as the integration of our new RGS technology opens the door to a stellar line-up of premium casino content we have planned for release throughout the year and beyond,” Sherman concluded.</p>
<p>Gaming titles developed by Bragg’s Atomic Slot Lab studio will be complemented with new exclusive content provided by Bragg’s partner studios further expanding Bragg’s presence in New Jersey demonstrating the company’s continued progress across North America.</p>
<p>“We have enjoyed a very productive relationship with Bragg and are pleased to extend our companies’ partnership as we know their slot content resonates with our players,” commented Matthew Sunderland, senior vice president of iGaming for Caesars Digital, convinced that the new gaming content delivered by Bragg will further elevate the player experience for their customers in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Bragg’s North American Expansion Continues</p>
<p>The launch of new gaming content in New Jersey extended the existing collaboration between Bragg Gaming and the online gaming arm of US casino giant Caesars Entertainment, building on their previous content agreements in the Garden State and Michigan.</p>
<p>In both gaming jurisdictions, Bragg Gaming provides Caesars Digital with its Spin Games RGS, and last year further built on the collaboration with Caesars by launching new content and its RGS technology in Michigan.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming content, both proprietary and aggregated from its partners, in New Jersey is also available for players with DraftKings following the launch with the Boston-based gaming operator last month in yet another partnership expansion achieved by the Canadian-based iGaming content and tech provider.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming’s RGS tech and Spin Games RGS content is also available for DraftKings players in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.</p>
