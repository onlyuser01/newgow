<p>Provider of esports and sports betting infrastructure Pinnacle Solution has been distinguished with SBC Awards’ Supplier of the Year in the esports segment.</p>
<p>Pinnacle Outstrips 13 Suppliers in SBC Awards for Supplier of the Year</p>
<p>Pinnacle Solution has consolidated its position as the leading provider of esports betting products at the recent SBC Awards 2020. The company competed against 13 suppliers in total, winning the Esports Supplier of the Year distinction in a highly-contested category featuring numerous esports-focused household names.</p>
<p>Pinnacle is among the first companies, alongside Betway, to seek and embrace esports betting not as a mere conversion tool, but as a way to attract new audiences and cater to their specific tastes.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, the company was among the few to channel and monetize esports betting successfully and offer a sustainable business and consumer model.</p>
<p>At a time when the industry’s confidence in the segment was low, Pinnacle led the way in creating and developing a new vertical which is now vastly recognized, and is finally catching the eye of the mainstream industry.</p>
<p>Pinnacle received commendations for the positive influence it has had over the rapidly accelerating esports markets and all of its betting nuances. The company has been able to deliver a product consumers appreciate as well comply with all regulatory prerequisites.</p>
<p>Leading the Way in Esports Infrastructure</p>
<p>Better yet, Pinnacle Solution now offers partner access to what the company describes as “a fully-customizable and content-rich esports product.”</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Pinnacle Trading Director Marco Blume noted that because of the company’s early entry into the segment and accumulated experience, Pinnacle has shaped itself as worthy of SBC’s award.</p>
<p>“Our esports offering, leveraging Pinnacle’s acclaimed trading and risk management expertise, is a proven revenue driver for partner operators and with the esports audience growing at such a pace, we’re ready to quickly assist those looking to tap into it.” -Pinnacle Trading Director Marco Blume</p>
<p>Pinnacle remains recognized as both a purveyor of sportsbook infrastructure, owing to its plug-and-play iFrame and Turnkey products, as well as its own esports betting markets that remains as competitive as ever.</p>
<p>Pinnacle has had a sizeable footprint in esports. It became a sponsor for North Esports back in 2019 and sponsored FLASHPOINT earlier in 2020.</p>
