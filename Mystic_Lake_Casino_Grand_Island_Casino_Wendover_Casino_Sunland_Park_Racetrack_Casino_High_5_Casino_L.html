<p>Hello Mario123,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your complaint and I'm really sorry to hear about your issue with Sportaza Casino. Please allow me to ask you a few more question before we would try to contact the casino. Could you please specify how many documents did the casino request from you so far? Could you please advise if it's your first withdrawal in the casino and if you've played with any deposit or no deposit bonus?</p>
<p>Also please note that verification is very important process where the casino wants to assure themselves that they are sending the money to the right owner. Every casino has different policy for this and I've had experience with much worse cases. You can also try to reason with the casino that you can send them any other document which they would approve as this one costs you some money. Will be looking forward to your answer and I hope we will be able to help you resolve the case as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nick</p>
