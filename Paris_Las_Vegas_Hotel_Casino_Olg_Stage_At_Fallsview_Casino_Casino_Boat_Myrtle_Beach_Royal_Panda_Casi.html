<p>Yggdrasil, one of the leading suppliers in the iGaming industry, has teamed up with Campeón Gaming, an operator of various online casino brands, in a bid to strengthen the latter’s selection of titles and introduce new experiences to players.</p>
<p>Campeón Gaming is happy to welcome Yggdrasil as the latest supplier to strengthen its game library, bringing along distinct and unique titles such as the YG Masters offering, built around stronger gamification, engagement, and player retention.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Commercial Director Jose Kadala has welcomed the opportunity to work with Campeón Gaming, as the partnership focuses on the Latin American market, where the supplier is committed to growing its regional and local footprint.</p>
<p>"We have seen players and operators in Latin America take well to both our proprietary content and that of our YG Masters studios and we are extremely excited to further extend our reach in the market by partnering with Campeón Gaming, an established and prominent operator with expertise in the field," Kadala explained in detail.</p>
<p>This is not all, as Yggdrasil has been actively expanding its reach with exciting titles, introducing games under its YG Masters platform, and ensuring that partner operators drive strong differentiation when competing against other brands in local markets.</p>
<p>Not least, Yggdrasil is also the author of such advanced technologies such as GATI and Game Engagement Mechanics, which have led to unique titles, such as Starfire Fortunes TopHit, 10,000 BC DoubleMax, and Legend of Dragon Wins DoubleMax, all of which are created to provide you with unique and worthwhile ways to experience your favorite iGaming products.</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by Campeón Gaming Group Chief Commercial Officer George Merodoulakis who said that the group was constantly on the lookout to add new brands and enrich the available gaming portfolio in a bid to strengthen the available choices to its players.</p>
<p>Tapping Yggdrasil for that job was the right call, Merodoulakis said. Yggdrasil has been doing well in the meantime. The company closed last week with a brand new release, King Arthur 10K Ways, upping the payline count and sending players on an epic quest. Earlier this month, the supplier also introduced Sidewinder, with Yggdrasil quickly becoming one of the most prolific providers of games early in the year.</p>
