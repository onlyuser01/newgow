<p>Global managed hosting, connectivity and security provider Continent 8 Technologies, has reinforced its commercial team by appointing Brian B. Koh as its new CCO. Koh brings years of experience to the company and will be a great addition to its team.</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies Adds Koh as CCO</p>
<p>Koh will join Continent 8 Technologies as its new chief commercial officer and will use his expertise to boost its profits. Prior to joining the hosting provider, Koh worked for various companies across three continents. During his two-decade-long career, he helped build several multinational companies to successful exits. Before being named as CCO of Continent 8, the experienced worker served as EVP at Syntax. His earlier experiences include tenures at IT Convergence and Core Services.</p>
<p>As CCO of Continent 8, Koh will join its New York-based office and will work directly under CEO Michael Tobin. Koh’s job will be to turn the company’s growth plans into reality. In addition, Koh will be responsible for developing and implementing Continent 8’s commercial strategy. To that end, he will provide crucial input into the company’s sales, account management, customer service and marketing.</p>
<p>Koh joins Continent 8 at just the right time. The company is currently doubling down on its international expansion and is bullish on expanding in the key LATAM region. As CCO, Koh will oversee and support this growth.</p>
<p>CEO Tobil Welcomed the New Appointee</p>
<p>Michael Tobin, Continent 8 Technologies’ founder and chief executive, welcomed Koh to the team. He called him “a significant addition” and said that he is coming just at the right time. Tobin noted that the company needs strong commercial leadership in order to remain at the top of its game.</p>
<p>As more countries embrace regulation and new markets open for business, we see a huge opportunity for Continent 8 to expand its reach and deliver our award-winning managed hosting, connectivity, cloud and security solutions to customers entering these jurisdictions. Michael Tobin, CEO, Continent 8 Technologies</p>
<p>Tobin added that Koh has been tasked with overseeing the company’s expansion and said that there is no other person who is better suited for the job.</p>
<p>Koh himself commented on his new appointment. He said that he is thrilled to join Continent 8 and is looking forward to working with its talented team to grow its business. He said that there was no way he could have turned down such an exciting offer from such a respected brand and vowed to leverage his experience to support its growth.</p>
<p>Continent 8’s customer base and reputation in the industry is second to none, and I look forward to playing my part in the next chapter of Continent 8’s success story. Brian Koh, CCO, Continent 8 Technologies</p>
<p>Continent 8 will appear at G2E Vegas next week. Last month, the MGCB approved the company for gaming cloud launch.</p>
