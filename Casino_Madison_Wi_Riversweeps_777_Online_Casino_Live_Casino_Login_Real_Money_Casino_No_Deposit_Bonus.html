<p>Konami Gaming has announced that it is installing its SYNKROS casino management system across 11 ships owned by Holland America Line. The management system is already in place, the company confirmed in a press statement and the addition of SYNKROS will seek to optimize the existing slot machine experiences for guests and travelers, Konami said.</p>
<p>Holland America Line Gets Better Casino and Slot Experiences</p>
<p>Holland America Line has a vast fleet of ships that feature various casino experiences, with a particular focus on slots. Through the addition of Konami solutions, the cruise line hopes that it will further enhance the experience for its players and guests and help them stay satisfied. The system also includes points that can be redeemed for various prizes and other promotional offers onboard.</p>
<p>There will be prize draws, floor-wide bonus events, slot tournaments, and more, all designed to boost engagement with guests and offer them excellent opportunities to enjoy great slot games and additional events. The deal is also part of a previous negotiation between Konami and Carnival Corporation &amp; plc which saw SYNKROS installed as the leading gaming management system for the cruise line company back in 2018. Carnival Corporation SVP of global casino operations Marty Goldman said:</p>

<p>Goldman welcomed the latest installation on Holland America Line ships and added that this further consolidated Carnival Corporation’s leading role in providing guests with some of the best recreational activities onboard. The news was naturally welcomed by Konami Gaming COO and EVP Tom Jingoli who was similarly satisfied with the development and added that SYNKROS will create a range of innovative experiences and initiatives for the guests on Holland America Line.</p>
<p>SYNKROS to Guide the Way</p>
<p>“Konami is committed to an equally successful implementation across Carnival Corporation’s global fleet,” Jingoli noted. Konami’s most recent financial results were also strong during the second quarter of the year for the period that ended on June 30, 2022. The company reported revenue of $540.5 million and continues to be expanding rapidly in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Konami is also bringing in more veterans to help with its Asian operations. The company hired David Punter as one of the company’s latest executives to spreadhead the company’s growth in the region. Carnival previously struck a partnership with BetMGM to bring the latter’s betting sportsbook onboard its ships.</p>
