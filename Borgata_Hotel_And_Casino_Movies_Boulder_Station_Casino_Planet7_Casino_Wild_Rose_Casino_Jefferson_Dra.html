<p>PartyPoker will be giving away loads of free tickets to its upcoming MILLIONS, with a potential $1 million bonus to the winner.</p>
<p>PartyPoker MILLION Guarantees $20M</p>
<p>Partypoker is known for offering up some amazing online tournaments – and its upcoming $20 Million Guaranteed event is going to top them all. The site is going to be giving away loads of tickets via satellites and there will be a special $1 million bonus if the winner meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past month, partypoker has awarded over $1 million in free tickets for players who have completed certain missions. This is a great incentive for players of all bankrolls, and means that just about anyone could walk away with the first-place prize in the partypoker MILLIONS.</p>
<p>Additionally, partypoker will be giving away an extra $1 million if the player who wins the whole thing also ended up in first place on Day 1. However, if the player makes any deals, then the bonus will be forfeited.</p>
<p>“If you’re chip leader after Day 1A, and you win it, you’re gonna add another million? That’s just crazy. That’s crazy!“ John Duthie, chairman of partypoker LIVE</p>
<p>If you want to take part in the promotion, you’ll have to buy into any Day 1 but you have to post your buy-in before play begins on Day 1A. You can find the full terms and conditions on partypoker’s website.</p>
<p>This is a huge event, and there will certainly be some amazing action. Last yeast, a total over $21.83m was paid out to players who took part. The top prize went to Manuel ‘Sheparentao’ Ruiv, who won $2.3 million, who made a final table deal. In fact, four of the final table players were made into millionaires.</p>
<p>With this additional $1 million bonus, the winner could be laughing all the way to the bank – and even further! There could be over $3 million up for grabs if the winner from Day 1 lands themselves in the top spot overall.</p>
<p>Mega Satellite Program</p>
<p>There is also the Mega Satellite program that will be offering players the chance to win tickets into the event. In the program, there will be two events on December 1st and December 8th that will award 50 $10,300 tickets into the big event. The satellite costs just $1,050 but if that’s too expensive, there will also be smaller feeder events.</p>
<p>We’ll definitely be watching, as there is sure to be some very thrilling poker action in partypoker’s $20M event this year.</p>
