<p>iGaming studio and developer Gaming Realms has negotiated a content partnership with Aspire Global’s Pariplay Ltd, an aggregator of online casino games. As a result, Gaming Realms’ products will be integrated with the Fusion aggregation platform developed by Pariplay and operating in over 15 regulated markets across the world, including Europe, North, and Latin America.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms to Benefit from Fusion Aggregator Platform</p>
<p>Gaming Realms will be able to distribute its unique mobile-friendly gaming content, including its Slingo titles, to a much wider audience, benefiting from Pariplay’s streamlined delivery system and reach in established jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Pariplay Fusion aggregation platform already offers thousands of games, but it makes sure that every new brand has equal visibility and awareness. As an additive pro, the platform comes with a suite of back-office tools for the purposes of conversion and retention, thus enhancing the value for business partners and facilitating onboarding and new customer acquisitions.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been on a roll recently, inking a partnership in the United States with BetMGM in November. The company’s content studio, Wizard Games, partnered up with Greek gaming giant Kaizen Gaming, and Pariplay has been actively working with Rush Street Interactive.</p>
<p>Pariplay commercial director Shivan Patel welcomed the opportunity to be adding another iGaming content provider, as the company is constantly on the lookout to expand its product offering with new demographics:</p>
<p>“This deal with Gaming Realms provides our Fusion platform with content that is carefully designed with mobile devices in mind, cleverly leveraging IP and brands to deliver innovative and engaging new styles of games that I know will be a firm hit with customers around the world.” Pariplay commercial director Shivan Patel</p>
<p>Expanding in Existing and New Markets</p>
<p>Gaming Realms commercial director Gareth Scott said the partnership was a way forward for the company as well. He explained that through Pariplay’s powerful aggregation platform, Gaming Realms would be able to complement existing markets as well as expand into new ones, citing regulated jurisdictions as the company’s sole priority. Gaming Realms’ Slingo product is another core focus, Scott spoke about:</p>
<p>“The growing reputation of Slingo and its unique gameplay continually drives player demand. We’re humbled to have several sponsor operators go live immediately, including through Aspire Global, and look forward to onboarding further operators over the coming weeks.” Gaming Realms commercial director Gareth Scott</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has enjoyed a strong 2021 so far. Through its tie-up with Pariplay, the company is only going to build on its momentum from the past year and take its products to new audiences as hoped by executives.</p>
