<p>Genius Sports has strengthened its core team by adding a former executive from NFL Media to its team. The one joining the sports data and technology company is the experienced Glen Herold.</p>
<p>Herold Brings Decades of Experience to the Team</p>
<p>Herold will be joining Genius Sports as vice president of product, media and fan engagement. In his role, the appointee will oversee Genius Sports’ three divisions. Also, he will help the brand better appeal to fans of sports. Genius Sports will leverage Herold’s substantial experience in sports to boost and diversify its offerings.</p>
<p>The new VP has over two decades of critical experience that will be of great value to his new company. His career saw him begin as a senior consultant at the business consultancy Deloitte. After almost a decade in the position, Herold joined The North Highland Company. He served that other consultancy for almost six years.</p>
<p>In 2015, Herold opened a new chapter in his career. In particular, he founded GOAT, a skill and social matching platform for fantasy sports. Then, he joined NFL Media, the National Football League’s content brand. Herold went through several roles while serving the NFL, including director of planning, senior director of digital strategy and operations, senior director of media strategy and operations and head of gaming and sports betting.</p>
<p>Herold’s unique combination of business skills and intimate knowledge of the sports and sports betting sector made him a perfect candidate for the new position.</p>
<p>Herold Is Excited to Work for Genius Sports</p>
<p>Herold will support Genius Sports from its office in Los Angeles. He shared his thoughts on his new job in LinkedIn. According to his announcement, the new VP cannot wait to work with Genius Sports’ team.</p>
<p>I’m excited to share that I’ve started a new position as vice president of product, media and fan engagement at genius sports. There, I’ll be working as part of a talented team that is powering the global ecosystem of sports, sports betting and media. Glen Herold, vice president of product, media and fan engagement, Genius Sports</p>
<p>Herold added that he is glad by how far he has come and thanked everyone who supported him throughout the years.</p>
<p>From hobby to my own product, my own product to the NFL, and now the NFL to the center of sports globally, I appreciate that journey and am so grateful for those that helped make it possible. Glen Herold, vice president of product, media and fan engagement, Genius Sports</p>
<p>Genius Sports recently posted its financial results for Q1 of 2022. The company’s revenues increased dramatically but the high operating costs offset the revenue and resulted in a negative EBITDA.</p>
