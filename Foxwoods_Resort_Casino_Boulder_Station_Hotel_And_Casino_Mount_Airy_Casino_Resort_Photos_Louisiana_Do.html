    <h1>Foxwoods Resort Casino Boulder Station Hotel And Casino Mount Airy Casino Resort Photos Louisiana Do</h1>

<p>I registered with Jokerino with a bonus code and won hundreds of euros. I made 1450 out of 10 Euro no deposit bonus and wanted to withdraw the amount, what I didn't know is that I should only find 100 when I next log in. Then I wrote to support and asked where all the money went. Then the support said the following:</p>
<p>Chat on jokerino.com</p>
<p>Conversation started on</p>
<p>: Saturday, December 12, 2020, at 20:43 (GMT + 0)</p>
<p>[20:44] Customer Support:</p>
<p>Welcome to Jokerino.com. How can we help ?</p>
<p>[8:44 pm] Me: Hello</p>
<p>[20:44] Juliana has herself</p>
<p>in the conversation</p>
<p>[20:45] Juliana: Hello</p>
<p>[20:45] Me: I had</p>
<p>1450 euros in payout. Now there are only 100 left. Where did the money go?</p>
<p>[20:48] Juliana: ok</p>
<p>[20:48] Me:?</p>
<p>[20:48] Juliana: you</p>
<p>won with the free</p>
<p>[20:49] Juliana: and there</p>
<p>the max payout is € 100</p>
<p>[20:50] Me: And if I do</p>
<p>Increase the money now, Max Cash out remains 100 euros or do I get the money</p>
<p>if I would now, for example, make 300 euros out of there?</p>
<p>[20:50] Juliana: yes then</p>
<p>the 100 € are now your cash</p>
<p>[20:51] Me: So if</p>
<p>I come back to 1000 euros then I get the money?</p>
<p>[20:51] Juliana: yes</p>
<p>[20:51] Juliana: because she</p>
<p>€ 100 is your money now</p>
<p>[20:51] Me: Ok, thanks</p>
<p>[20:51] Me: Nice ones</p>
<p>Evening</p>
<p>[20:52] Juliana: thank you,</p>
<p>Likewise</p>
<p>[20:52] Juliana has it</p>
<p>To leave the conversation</p>
<p>Then I went out</p>
<p>the 100 euros made 1000 euros and paid out.</p>
<p>After that, I only got 100</p>
<p>euro transferred to my account. Although I thought I would still have 900 euros</p>
<p>on the casino account. So on my Jokerino account was 900 euros</p>
<p>withheld that are no longer available to me. So I have the support</p>
<p>wrote back and he quarreled with me.</p>
