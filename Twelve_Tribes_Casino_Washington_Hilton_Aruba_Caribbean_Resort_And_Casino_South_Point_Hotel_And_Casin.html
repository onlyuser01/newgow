<p>While live poker rooms have taken a step backward because of COVID-19, online poker is headed in the right direction. Michigan is the latest state to begin to develop an online poker market, thanks to the rollout of BetMGM and its partnership with online poker platform partypoker US Network. BetMGM, the sports gambling and online gaming operator backed by MGM Resorts International, has introduced BetMGM Poker in Michigan, making the state the second where the platform has a presence.</p>
<p>BetMGM Helps Develop Online Gaming in Michigan</p>
<p>BetMGM first introduced its online casino games and sports gambling options to Michigan this past January as one of several operators to have been approved by the Michigan Gaming Control Board. As online gaming continued to rise in popularity in the state, BetMGM announced in February that it would introduce online poker. It has now fulfilled that goal and BetMGM Poker, run through a separate mobile or desktop app, is open to all users of the BetMGM online casino and sports gambling mobile app.</p>
<p>According to a press release, BetMGM Poker has a number of virtual poker rooms set up for players across the state. Through its partnership with partypoker, there are signature poker tournaments, cash games at different buy-in levels, and a variety of poker options to appeal to a wide range of users. Although the poker app is separate from the main BetMGM app, users will see their BetMGM account balance across both, so they only have to manage a single wallet.</p>
<p>More Benefits for More Users</p>
<p>As opposed to some of the other online gaming alternatives, BetMGM has a unique advantage. Because it is backed by MGM, through a partnership with Entain, users can use MGM’s M life Rewards program in conjunction with the app to earn gameplay points that can be redeemed through MGM locations and certain partners. Among these are MGM Grand Detroit, MGM Grand, Bellagio, and ARIA in Las Vegas, Borgata in New Jersey, MGM National Harbor in Maryland, and Beau Rivage in Mississippi.</p>
<p>BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt adds of the operator’s expanded gaming options in Michigan, “The launch of BetMGM Poker in Michigan fully rounds out our premier gaming portfolio in the state. BetMGM’s sports betting and casino offerings have been met with incredible early success in Michigan, and we’re thrilled to provide players with another exciting gaming option.”</p>
<p>Online Gaming Continues to Grow</p>
<p>By most estimates, the online gaming segment is rapidly becoming the go-to alternative for gamblers. Accelerated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, digital gambling growth is far outpacing that of land-based gaming in a trend that most analysts predict will continue. BetMGM is poised to take advantage of that growth and continues to find new areas to serve. BetMGM Poker is now authorized in Michigan and Pennsylvania, and, in total, BetMGM serves ten states in the US. It is also partnered with Major League Soccer, MLB, Topgolf Entertainment Group, Yahoo, and more.</p>
<p>Online games, including poker, are likely to become even more popular soon. This past January, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that the Department of Justice was incorrect in trying to redefine the scope of the Federal Wire Act of 1961. As a result, states were ostensibly given the green light to expand online gaming options and introduce new interstate gaming agreements. This could allow player pooling in games like poker, which could offer several benefits. Tournament prize pools would increase, which would lead to more winnings for players and potentially more revenue for states.</p>
