<p>DraftKings, FanDuel and Fanatics Sportsbook rolled out their services with the launch of the legal sports betting market in the state</p>
<p>On Thursday, Vermont became the latest state to join a growing list of US jurisdictions, offering legal sports wagering. The activity was legalized in June last year after Gov. Phil Scott signed the state’s sports betting bill into law. Now, as of January 11, 2024, Vermont officially launched its legal sports betting market.</p>
<p>Similar to other states, residents who want to engage in sports betting across Vermont need to be 21 years or older. The market in the state was established along with strict rules for player protection, while proceeds from the activity are expected to hit $7 million for the first year.</p>
<p>The launch of legal betting comes after last month, Gov. Scott confirmed that sports bettors will be able to wager legally starting from January. Undoubtedly, the activity will attract many bettors and sports fans, especially considering that it comes just in time for the Super Bowl playoffs and the Super Bowl that will follow.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that leading sports betting operators showed interest in offering their services in Vermont. The short list includes DraftKings, FanDuel and Fanatics Sportsbook, all of which have secured sports betting licenses, permitting them to offer the activity in the state.</p>
<p>Three Licensed Sportsbooks Launch Their Services</p>
<p>Going live with the opening of the legal sports betting market in Vermont, DraftKings entered its 26th US state. Besides a strong footprint across the country, the operator currently has a presence in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>On the other hand, FanDuel’s entry continues to grow the company’s US footprint. Vermont represents the 21st state where the leading sports betting operator’s services are available, joining a long list that includes major markets such as Ohio, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Maryland, to name a few.</p>
<p>The recent launch also represents a major milestone for Fanatics Sportsbook, the third licensed sports betting operator that secured approval to introduce its services in Vermont. As one of the first three operators to enter the state, Fanatics continues to grow its presence across the US and the latest entry follows launches in markets such as Ohio, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Tennessee, among others.</p>
<p>The sportsbooks applications of the three betting operators in Vermont are available for iOS and Android devices. Launching their services for customers in the state, DraftKings, FanDuel and Fanatics Sportsbook have all committed to the established rules about responsible gambling.</p>
