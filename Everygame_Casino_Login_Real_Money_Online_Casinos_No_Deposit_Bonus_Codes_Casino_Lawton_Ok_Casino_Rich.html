    <h1>Everygame Casino Login Real Money Online Casinos No Deposit Bonus Codes Casino Lawton Ok Casino Rich</h1>

<p>The developer’s newest offering is already live in New Jersey, with more jurisdictions soon to follow. As PENN Entertainment’s in-house game development arm, Penn Game Studios drew inspiration from the popular Barstool podcast Pardon My Take. The multi-slot and progressive jackpot title attracts customers with its vibrant looks, several jackpots, and exciting mechanics.</p>
<p>Pardon My Take’s Larry the Goldfish Receives His Own Game</p>
<p>Penn Game Studios drew heavy inspiration from the goldfish mascot from the leading Barstool Sports podcast Pardon My Take. Delivering “the loudest and most correct sports takes in the history of the spoken word,” Pardon My Take quickly established itself as a fan-favorite, now featuring over 600 episodes with no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>The podcast features an impressive audience score of 4.9 out of 5 and tackles the hottest sports topics in the US, with new two-hour episodes coming out twice a week. The hosts routinely engage with fans and focus on a well-rounded experience with great content and surprising guests. The team’s goldfish mascot, Larry, is a recurring character, now immortalized in the new PENN game.</p>
<p>The choice of inspiration is very fitting, considering that the game will initially feature exclusively on the Barstool Sportsbook &amp; Casino. Legendary Larry features the titular character, a goldfish with a big imagination and dreams about fortune and fame as he collects coins and interacts with other denizens of the deep.</p>
<p>The Developers Created a Novel and Engaging Slots Experience</p>
<p>Legendary Larry is Penn Game Studios’ first attempt at combining several popular features into one seamless, player-focused package. The multi-slot game features five reels with Free Spins, Shifting Wilds, and Hold &amp; Respin versatility. Players can win three tiers of jackpots, including a progressive mega jackpot for maximum excitement.</p>
<p>Progressive mechanics continue to gain popularity in the industry due to their potential to attract high-rolling players. Operators can create a network where each individual bet contributes towards a single cumulative jackpot, which can grow far beyond traditional slots. Penn Game Studios VP Paul Hake expressed confidence in the new title, lauding the in-house development team for their continued excellence.</p>
<p>Legendary Larry brings an exciting and unique twist to well-established mechanics… and we believe it will be a hit with our players. Paul Hake, Penn Game Studios vice-president</p>
<p>The new title is available on mobile and desktop via Barstool Sportsbook &amp; Casino in New Jersey. The operator plans additional launches in the near future, including with Ontario’s Score Bet and Casino. Penn Game Studios have quickly risen to prominence since their 2021 launch, developing high-quality original titles for PENN brands that stand toe-to-toe with the best the industry can offer.</p>
