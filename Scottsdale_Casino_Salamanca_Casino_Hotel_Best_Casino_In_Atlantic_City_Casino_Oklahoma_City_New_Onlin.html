    <h1>Scottsdale Casino Salamanca Casino Hotel Best Casino In Atlantic City Casino Oklahoma City New Onlin</h1>

<p>Blexr, a Malta-based dynamic digital media company, and a leading iGaming affiliate, has reinforced its senior management team by appointing two industry experts in executive positions. The ones joining the company are Nick Walker and Andrew Isidoro, who will be serving as chief operating officer and chief marketing officer respectively.</p>
<p>Walker Assumes Office as COO</p>
<p>Nick Walker, Blexr’s new chief operating officer, is a seasoned specialist with 12 years in the product delivery space. His experience includes tenures in various positions at numerous respectable media companies.</p>
<p>Between 2014 and 2016, Walker worked for the renowned news outlet Financial Times. He served as an agile project manager before being promoted to senior project manager. His last year saw him work as Financial Times’ program lead for data technology.</p>
<p>After that, Walker joined News UK and worked as the head of delivery for The Sun and News UK’s core platforms. Walker had a stint with Sporting Group, followed by a two-year service as iTech Media’s head of agile delivery.</p>
<p>As a part of Blexr, Walker will manage the administrative functions and help devise strategies for improving the company’s content. He said that he is excited to join Blexr’s team at such a crucial time.</p>
<p>Walker said that he hopes to help everyone on the team achieve their goals and work with his colleagues to “make Blexr into an even more prominent player within the lead generation industry.”</p>
<p>Isidoro Will Lead Blexr’s Marketing as CMO</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andrew Isidoro will assume responsibility for Blexr’s marketing operations. Isidoro is a former colleague of Walker’s as they both used to work for iTech Media before joining Blexr. He is also an SEO expert whose expertise will be crucial to promoting Blexr’s brand.</p>
<p>Isidoro has extensive experience thanks to his time in marketing positions at multiple companies. He has worked as a digital strategist for Box UK, followed by five-year tenure at GoCompare where he served as SEO, outreach, and social media manager and later as group head of SEO.</p>
<p>Isidoro later moved to Dyson where he once again served as head of SEO. After more than a year with the company, he moved to become head of marketing acquisition for The AA – his last job before joining iTech Media.</p>
<p>Isidoro said that he is thrilled to join Blexr’s team, which he described as a “wonderful bunch of people.” He added that he believes Blexr’s potential is unlimited, which is why he looks forward to working with the rest of the team to build and accelerate the momentum of the company’s portfolio.</p>
