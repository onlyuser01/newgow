    <h1>Is Hard Rock Casino Open 24 Hours Limitless Casino 100 Free Chip On Line Casino Rosebud Casino Casin</h1>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I played and won at this casino.</p>
<p>Didnt have any problems got told to verify and could upload ID and address documents.</p>
<p>Then i got an email from kyc@20bets.com tell me to upload a video verification with id and a paper with information on and to tell the info written out loud.</p>
<p>Okey its annoying but i do it anyway, so i make the video and try to send to their email but i got an error message saying either the email dont exist or they cant receive emails.</p>
<p>I contact support and tell them this and they say nothing is wrong from their side and i have to clear cache, i do it and still same problem.</p>
<p>I ask why i cant upload in my profile like i could with id and address and didnt get any answer about that.</p>
<p>I ask if i can upload in the chat and they say i cant.</p>
<p>I ask them for another email to send the video to and at first they dont want to give me another email address but after some back and forth they give me the address support@20bets.com and i send email and no error message so i tell them this and they claim they havnt received an email from me.</p>
<p>I ask them to send me an email from support@20bets.com and they dont want to do it, very wierd because that would prove some stuff.</p>
<p>After alot of back and forth they say the kyc depaprtment will send another email to me and they choose to send to me from the kyc@20bets.com email and i tried to answer that email but error message again.</p>
<p>I ask them to send me an email from support@20bets.com and they basicly answer fast that they have provided how to verify and they close the chat on me.</p>
<p>Its pretty obvious they dont want to get this resolved because else they could just take the video in the chat window or let me upload it in my 20bets account or just send me an email from the other email they provided support@20bets.com.</p>
<p>I will send you the chat transcripts and you will easily see that im doing all in my power to send them this video but they do everything they can to not receive it.</p>
