<p>Phoenix Suns Have Great History Against Denver Nuggets</p>
<p>In the 2022-23 season, the Suns played against the Nuggets on five occasions, winning two of those. It doesn’t seem too impressive, but both of those wins happened relatively recently – in their last two meetings. One happened on the last day of March (100-93), while the other was on April 6 (119-115).</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that both of those victories happened in Phoenix. In fact, this team has a great record against the Nuggets in games played at Footprint Center. On the road, however, it’s a bit different story.</p>
<p>In fact, the Suns lost each of their three previous games played in Denver. Plus, they did not do too great against other opponents on the road as well. In the regular season, their away record was 17-24. In comparison, their home record was 28-13.</p>
<p>Still, we did see them put on two brilliant performances on the road in the playoffs. They destroyed the Los Angeles Clippers in both of the games played in California.</p>
<p>Another Great Offensive Display Expected from Denver Nuggets</p>
<p>The Denver Nuggets got to the West Semis after beating the Timberwolves 3-1 in the series. The only loss they suffered happened after overtime. In that game, we saw the Nuggets score just 96 points in regulation. Actually, they’ve been scoring modestly since the start of the postseason, with their best performance being 122 points in Game 2.</p>
<p>The reason behind this isn’t that they’ve suddenly become bad in the offense. It’s just that they were playing against one of the best defensive teams in the league. But this time, it’s going to be different. Against the Nets, they’re bound to do much, much better scoring-wise.</p>
<p>It’s not just because the boys from Arizona tend to concede a relatively high number of points, but also because Denver’s key men have entered a beast mode. The reigning NBA MVP Nikola Jokic has been sensational, and so has Jamal Murray.</p>
<p>Phoenix Suns vs Denver Nuggets Prediction</p>
<p>At home, the Nuggets look capable of beating any other team. We think they’re going to beat the Suns. And we think it’s going to be a big one. We’re probably going to witness a lot of points on both ends, with the Nuggets scoring just enough to cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Denver Nuggets to win and cover the spread; points “over” to hit</p>
