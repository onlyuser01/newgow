    <h1>Durant Casino And Resort Tunica Casino Hotels Onlin Casino Casinos In Delaware Hotels And Casinos Ne</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>I wish to file a complaint against Sportaza website (www.sportaza.com). My account has been wrongly and unfairly closed by Sportaza. They sent me an email accusing me of violating their terms and conditions. But they don't reply specifically when I ask them what exactly I did against their terms and conditions. They are also not providing me any proof for their allegation. Please ask the operator to either provide proof for their allegation or return my money.</p>
<p>They have shared four different violations under their Terms and Conditions clause 9.1 namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>using the Website for commercial purposes or in someone elseâ€™s name or interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engaging in any fraudulent activities, including, without limitation, using any credit/debit cards or other payment methods or</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>funds not belonging to you, cases were funds are recalled/disputed;</p>
<ul>
<li>colluding with other customers or third parties. This includes, without limitation, playing in the interest of others, sharing</li>
</ul>
<p>information, cooperating or coordinating with others;</p>
<ul>
<li>using unfair betting patterns or strategies, such as equal, zero or low margin bets, bets with minimal risks, hedge betting, or</li>
</ul>
<p>otherwise placing bets in such a way that in our opinion the system is being abused, guaranteed win is achieved, or the risk</p>
<p>is minimized;</p>
<p>But they are not specifying which particular condition out of these four I violated. However, I guess (I can only guess since they are not being specific) that they suspect me of colluding with another customer. I had transferred some money to my friend Priti K<strong><em>*</em> (email- prit</strong><strong><em>*</em></strong>22@gmail.com) through my Neteller account, which they might have discovered through my Neteller transaction history that they had asked for account verification. However, it was just a normal transaction - borrowing and lending between two friends. We never colluded with each other. You can check our gambling history with Sportaza.</p>
<p>I plead you to kindly take strict action against Sportaza so that they learn a lesson and never think of cheating any other customer.</p>
