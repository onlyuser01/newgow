<p>Auburn Backer Misses Risk/Reward Memo, Lays $1,000 at Caesars to Win $5</p>

<p>The Auburn Tigers of the vaunted Southeastern Conference (SEC), the eighth-ranked team in the country, take on the Kent State Golden Flashes from the Mid-American Conference (MAC) at Jordan-Hare Stadium in Alabama on Saturday. As one might expect, the Tigers are heavy favorites, currently -35.5 points, to be precise.</p>

<p>But that didn’t stop one bettor from rolling into the Caesars Palace sportsbook on the Las Vegas Strip Tuesday to plunk down $1,000 on the Tigers on the moneyline at -20000. Assuming Auburn wins outright, and they very likely will, the gambler will net a meager $5 for his efforts.</p>
<p>The bet was originally highlighted by Caesars director of trading Jeff Davis, and it’s a departure from one of the primary tenants of successful sports wagering: properly assessing risk and reward. Translation: a $5 reward is not adequate compensation for putting $1,000 at risk.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks love these bets, because even if the gambler wins, the operator’s loss is negligible, and if a team like Kent State pulls the upset, then the house is definitely the beneficiary.</p>
<p>Inside The Numbers</p>
<p>Auburn entered the 2019 season ranked No. 16, but vanquished the then-No. 11 Oregon Ducks 27-21 in a Week 1 thriller, 27-21. The Tigers followed that up with a 24-6 Week 2 win over Tulane. Kent State was pounded 30-7 by Arizona State to start the season, but the MAC team rebounded to defeat Kennesaw State 26-23 last week.</p>
<p>Over the course of Auburn’s storied football history, the team has been a favorite of 30 or more points, as they are Saturday against Kent State, 26 times, and won all of those games outright, indicating that the bettor’s $1,000 wager at Caesars is likely “safe,” if history repeats.</p>
<p>However, the Tigers have not been good at covering when they’re big chalk. In those 26 games where the Tigers were favored by 30-plus points, Auburn’s record against the spread is just 9-16-1. The projected score of Saturday’s tilt, according to OddsShark, is Auburn 38.3 – Kent State 12.5, indicating the $1,000 bettor may have been better off taking the Golden Flashes and the points at -110 (bet $110 to win $100).</p>
<p>Kent State has been an underdog of 30 or more points 17 times in its history, and has never won outright in that situation, going 7-10 against the spread in those tilts.</p>
<p>If the Golden Flashes pull the upset this week, it would be the fifth-largest spread upset in college football history. On the moneyline, Kent State is currently +9000 (bet $100 to win $9,000).</p>
<p>Going Small</p>
<p>Before picking on the Auburn backer, it’s worth noting that there are plenty of instances of bettors taking on large risk for meager rewards. As Casino.org reported in August, a gambler laid $100,500 at the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas on the Philadelphia 76ers making the 2020 NBA playoffs at -5000, meaning he’ll win just $2,010 and have his capital tied up for nine months for the privilege.</p>
<p>That same gambler also plunked down $10,000 on the Milwaukee Bucks to make the playoffs, a bet that will net him a cool $100 if successful.</p>
