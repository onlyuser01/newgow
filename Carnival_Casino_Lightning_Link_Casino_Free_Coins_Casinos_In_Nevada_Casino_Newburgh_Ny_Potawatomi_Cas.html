    <h1>Carnival Casino Lightning Link Casino Free Coins Casinos In Nevada Casino Newburgh Ny Potawatomi Cas</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have a slight issue which I hope can be sorted. I requested a Withdrawal of 700 about a week ago. Request was still pending longer than normal so I cancelled it, played on and won abit more. New withdrawal request amount 1700. Received email asking for verification of identity. Sent in required documents, then received the source of income form to fill out. Have sent bank statements for last 3 months which clearly shows my source of income and where it comes from! I personally find it incredibly intrusive and to be honest no one else's business. The way I see it is they're quite happy to take deposit after deposit but when it comes to making a withdrawal, an amount which is chump change compared to what these guys rake in every day, they seem to play hardball.</p>
<p>Any help would be muchly appreciated</p>
