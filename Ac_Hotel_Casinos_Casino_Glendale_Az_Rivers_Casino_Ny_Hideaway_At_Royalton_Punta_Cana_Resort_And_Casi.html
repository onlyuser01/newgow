<p>AGA posts gaming data that shows stronger results in US than Macau</p>
<p>Tribal gambling alone can compete with the Asian gaming hub</p>
<p>The industry in the US generates nearly $10 billion in tax money</p>
<p>The United States and Macau continue to vie for the title of the world’s largest gaming market. As it turns out, the U.S. had a slight edge over the Chinese autonomous region in 2018.</p>
<p>U.S. Non-Tribal Gaming Beats Macau’s Operations</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) has introduced numbers comparing the U.S. non-tribal gaming operations in 2018 to those of Macau, Asia’s busiest gaming hub. According to the trade body, revenue in the 465 casino properties across the country shot up to $41.7 billion in 2018, or a 3.5% increase overall. The information was collated with the help of supplies, manufacturers, and casino operators.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, revenue in Macau grossed $37.54 million over the same period with the data pulled off from the local regulator. Yet, Macau managed to do better in terms of growth, posting 14% growth from games of fortune. AGA CEO Bill Miller had this to say:</p>
<p>Year after year, the commercial casino industry has reaffirmed its role as an economic powerhouse in the United States.</p>
<p>AGA carried out a very thorough examination of the U.S. gaming and sports betting market, pinpointing the locations of important commercial properties all over the country, including:</p>
<p>Brick-and-mortar casinos</p>
<p>Riverboat properties</p>
<p>Racetrack operations</p>
<p>Jai alai frontons</p>
<p>The industry has grown significantly in 2018, with casinos now present in 29 states, as per the official report. This hasn’t been the only growth that the U.S. has experienced recently.</p>
<p>Tribal Operations Scale Up Nicely</p>
<p>The immensity of the U.S. betting and gaming market cannot be fully appreciated without considering tribal operations. According to the National Indian Gaming Commission, tribal operators posted $32.40 billion in AGR over the period. Tribal operators have a good footprint on the U.S. market with their properties being present in 24 casinos.</p>
<p>All in all, the industry also landed good profits for the states’ coffers, generating $9.7 billion in tax revenue. According to Miller, a growing number of people are experiencing the upsides of the gaming industry. Macau continues to expand, but the region is becoming far more fragmented, with Japan now pushing for a 2025-launch of its Integrated Resort (IR) project. South Korea is also growing more gunk-ho and looking to attract a high-paying gaming audience.</p>
<p>VIP casinos in Cambodia and the Philippines are no different. As Asia is caught in an internal strife, the U.S revenue continues to grow.</p>
