    <h1>New Buffalo Casino Game Room Casino Seminole Hard Rock Casino Hotel Chumba Casino Login Bonus Casino</h1>

<p>FanDuel and Genius Sports will continue to deepen their ties and joint operations by now leveraging NFL sports data and exploring fan engagement opportunities. Genius Sports will provide FanDuel with a variety of media assets and NFL advertising solutions to help the latter boost its standings with football fans.</p>
<p>FanDuel will also appoint Genius Sports as its programmatic marketing partner, strengthening both companies’ reach. Genius will impart its NFL assets, including the Next Gen Stats (NGS) and official data feeds it has access to through an official data partnership with the National Football League.</p>
<p>FanDuel to Leverage Sports Genius Data to Boost Offer</p>
<p>This will allow FanDuel to not only build upon better engagement with football audiences but also re-calibrate its offering insofar pre-match and in-play markets are concerned. Genius Sports will also bring other viable data from across other sports, even though the focus of the partnership falls on football.</p>
<p>This means that FanDuel will be able to enhance its offer by tapping directly into data feeds provided to Genius by the Premier League, Liga MX, and NASCAR. Commenting on this partnership, Genius Sports CEO Mark Locke welcomed the opportunity and argued that the company was delighted to be teaming up with a renowned name in the sports betting sector.</p>
<p>“With official data at its heart, this partnership enables FanDuel to better engage and monetize its customer base at every step of their journey. We couldn’t be prouder to be expanding our relationship with a clear giant of US sports betting in a way that entirely validates our long-held strategic vision.” Genius Sports CEO Mark Locke</p>
<p>Genius Sports Preferred Data Partner by America’s Elite</p>
<p>FanDuel Group’s general manager Niall Connell received the news with equal confidence in the two companies’ joint operations moving forward.</p>
<p>FanDuel has a commitment to constantly improving and elevating its product offering, Connell argued, and the inclusion of Genius Sports data feeds is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>“The new suite of offerings, including official NFL data, will enable us to better serve our customers and enhance America’s number one sportsbook,” Connell concluded, confident in FanDuel’s clout within the US betting ecosystem.</p>
<p>FanDuel is hardly the only company to have benefited from Genius Sports’ extensive expertise in the sports betting segment. The company already has several active partnerships with operators, including WynnBET, BetMGM and Entain, and Barstool Sportsbook. These alliances attest to Genius Sports’ significance to the sports betting segment in the US.</p>
<p>The data supplier has been securing licenses across the US many regulated states and, together with Sportradar, is one of the most trusted purveyors of sports data for the purposes of preserving sports integrity and encouraging healthier relationships between sports bettors and operators.</p>
