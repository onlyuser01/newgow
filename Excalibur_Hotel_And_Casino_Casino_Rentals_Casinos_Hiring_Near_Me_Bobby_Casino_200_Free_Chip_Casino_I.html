<p>Global supplier of lottery solutions International Game Technology (IGT) announced this week it won another lottery management contract, having been selected by the Connecticut Lottery Corporation (CLC) to deliver its products and services.</p>
<p>Aurora System Implementation</p>
<p>The lottery management contract given to IGT’s subsidiary Global Solutions Corporation by the CLC following a competitive procurement tasks the technology supplier with installing a new central system, providing for an implementation period until April 2023, when the launch of the new system is expected to take place. The new system will be IGT’s high-performing Aurora central lottery management system that will replace the one currently utilized by CLC via a conversion system.</p>
<p>IGT has a strong reputation of being a quality lottery system provider, and for modernizing its system and its related components. The Connecticut Lottery Corporation is looking forward to using the Aurora system, and working with the IGT staff to continue our strong sales performance and deliver exceptional player and retailer experiences.” Greg Smith, President and CEO, CLC</p>
<p>Incorporating a suite of flexible solutions, including intuitive, user-friendly applications, tools and reporting capabilities, the Aurora system is perfectly equipped to handle transaction processing, game management and back-office operations of the CLC, transform its business and propel it to further growth.</p>
<p>Expand Portfolio of Lotteries</p>
<p>“The Connecticut Lottery Corporation is among the most successful U.S. lotteries and IGT is happy to propel the Lottery’s achievements by delivering our world-class solutions,” said chief operating officer, Lottery at IGT Jay Gendron.</p>
<p>IGT’s success in implementing central systems is unrivaled, having completed 60 on-time, full-system conversions in the last 13 years, including nine conversions from competitor systems. In serving the Connecticut Lottery, IGT will leverage its decades of industry leadership to help drive the Lottery’s growth and offer engaging experiences for its players.” Jay Gendron, Chief Operating Officer, Lottery, IGT</p>
<p>Under the contract that is set to run for ten years starting from April 2023, with additional 5-year extension options, IGT will also distribute to lottery retailers 3,000 Retailer Pro and Retailer Compact lottery terminals, as well as 28 self-service vending machines 200 GameTouch.</p>
<p>The contract with the CLC further builds on IGT’s current portfolio of 25 US lotteries, as the technology firm currently processes more than 75% of lottery sales nationwide will be responsible for the central systems of all top five in terms of sales per capita US lottery operators.</p>
<p>The Global Lottery business of the technology supplier was left untouched by the internal restructuring announced earlier in the month that saw IGT establish a dedicated Digital &amp; Sports Betting division.</p>
