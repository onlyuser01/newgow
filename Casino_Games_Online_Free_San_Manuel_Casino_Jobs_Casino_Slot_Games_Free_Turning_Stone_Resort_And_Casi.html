<p>An unnamed victim identified as male was approached by one Samantha P. Gabino, 27, who offered sex in exchange for money. Later, an alleged accomplice showed up and robbed the victim from jackpot winnings at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Casino Patron Robbed of $8K by an Alleged Criminal Duo</p>
<p>Opportunism lurks on the casino floors in Washington as confirmed by the recent mishap that befell a lucky patron who had won $8.391.01 before getting robbed several hours after. Police reported that a man – who preferred to remain anonymous – was robbed at gunpoint at Legends Casino Hotel.</p>
<p>Having just won the small jackpot, the victim was approached by a woman police identified as Samantha P. Gabino, aged 27. Reporting the crime to the authorities, the victim said that Gabino had agreed to have sexual intercourse with him in exchange for money.</p>
<p>After going to a room, Gabino insisted on the victim wearing a condom. He said he didn’t have one and Gabino started “messaging her friends to bring her one,” the victim stated in the official record.</p>
<p>An official affidavit read that the victim had wanted to leave after a couple of hours of waiting, but Gabino managed to convince him to wait a little longer. Eventually, Gabino’s accomplice, Efrain Gaitan-Lopez, aged 23, arrived at the hotel and he was let in by Gabino, as confirmed by surveillance cameras.</p>
<p>After going to a room, Gabino insisted on the victim wearing a condom. He said he didn’t have one and Gabino started “messaging her friends to bring her one,” the victim stated in the official record.</p>
<p>Gaitan-Lopez immediately pulled a gun and threatened to shoot the man. The victim then produced between $6,000 and $7,000 and handed it over to Gaitan-Lopez, as he was fearing for his life.</p>
<p>Gabino has so far denied to have had any relationship with Gaitan-Lopez, claiming she didn’t know the man. Gaitan-Lopez appeared in court on December 2, charged with 1st Degree Robbery. A similar case was reported just recently in Eagle Mountain Casino, California.</p>
<p>The Zombie Killing in a Casino in Montana</p>
<p>A more disturbing case of casino robbery was recorded in July 2019. A Montana duo, Jeffery Glen Haverty and Donald Ray Cherry were found guilty for killing a casino patron, one Myron Wesley Knight.</p>
<p>Knight had just won $120 when Haverty and Cherry decided to rob him. The duo asked Knight if he wouldn’t mind accompanying them outside. Knight suspected they were trying to rob him, so he left his winnings at the casino.</p>
<p>When the man confronted him and asked him for his winnings, Knight only had about $6 in pocket change on him. This supposedly angered the pair who then attacked him. The most disturbing part in the case came later when Haverty explained that the pair had killed the man, because Cherry wanted to eat the victim’s brain.</p>
<p>While no brain-munching actually came to pass, the alleged motif behind this crime is one of the darkest on record.</p>
