<p>SoftSwiss has reported strong player acquisition rates for Afflika, its innovative and award-winning partner tracking platform. The company explained that Afflika has been able to spot and better understand why some online casinos choose to switch their affiliate management platforms.</p>
<p>The reason behind this migration is usually rooted in a lack of a number of important metrics and reporting tools that are otherwise important to the businesses that seek to extract the best value from their affiliate partnerships. For many of the companies seeking to migrate, the lack of detailed and customizable player and affiliate activity reporting has been a significant issue.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is the lack of an adequate AML compliance framework and strategy which has exposed many businesses to liabilities. Not least, there are often high costs of in-house development associated with a number of affiliate management platforms. This is where Afflika by SoftSwiss hopes it does much better.</p>
<p>The platform boasts excellent support for transitioning companies and has a robust technical staff that allows it to address any client concern. Afflika is happy to help companies looking for betteraffiliate management platforms make the journey towards their own solution.</p>
<p>Afflika boasts a number of advantages, including a cryptocurrency-friendly platform that includes payment options, multi-brand management under the Afflika account, full technical support and automation, and a complete multi-level reporting system, among others.</p>
<p>Head of Afflika by SoftSwiss AnastasiyaBorovaya has spoken about the success achieved by the company so far. However, Borovaya explained that companies and businesses should not be afraid to switch affiliate management companies, and they should find the right partner to help them with the process.</p>
<p>But all fears end with Afflika, as the platform is built in an intuitive way as to allow businesses to migrate freely and without fearing loss of revenue or performance. Quite to the contrary, migrations facilitated through Afflika usually lead to much better performance in comparison.</p>
<p>"At Affilka, we have built the necessary software platform migration expertise to take the lead. The process may be as simple as moving affiliate IDs and contact details or rather as complex as transitioning player historical data and affiliate payment history to meet the new platform’s requirements," Borovaya adds.</p>
<p>A recent case study involving BC.GAME’s migration showed a 20% monthly increase in playeracquisition, exemplifying the power and deeper understanding the Afflika solution brings together. Afflika will be showcased during the SiGMA Europe in Valetta, Malta on November 14 - 18, 2022.</p>
