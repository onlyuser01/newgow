<p>EPIC Risk Management, a company that specializes in helping eliminate problem gambling, has announced a seminal partnership with Slough FC, a soccer club. The partnership will see EPIC Risk Management become the primary away shirt sponsor for the club as the company and the team both continue on their mission to educate soccer fans about the dangers of gambling and focus on harm prevention.</p>
<p>The partnership is important for at least several reasons. First, it defies the idea that sports clubs need only collaborate with sportsbooks. Secondly, it also sends an important message that clubs can have a very powerful say in the type of content their fans see.</p>
<p>Promoting safer gambling messages and the logo of companies that work to reduce and altogether eliminate gambling harm is a way to reaffirm this commitment. EPIC is a company that says that it wants to take the "problem out of gambling," and which works on harm prevention programs, training, and generally helping people be better informed about gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>EPIC Risk Management is unique in another way as 50% of the staff also comes from lived experience. This means that the team at EPIC fully understands the challenges of problem gambling and gambling-related harm and can offer an insightful and actionable way to address what has become a serious problem in British society and beyond. EPIC CEO Paul Buck welcomed this opportunity and said:</p>
<p>"There's a special personal connection between EPIC and Slough Town thanks to Scott Davies and therefore we're delighted to support the direction he's looking to take the club as the new away shirt sponsors."</p>
<p>EPIC has enjoyed working with the club and thanked the opportunity to make a difference on a local level – something that resonates with the company’s core mission. Buck added that he was proud to be working with Slough FC during the 2023/2024 and 2024/2025 seasons in a bid to drive safer gambling messages to sports audiences.</p>
<p>Buck further said that this away shirt partnership would hopefully lead to people asking themselves who EPIC are and why it matters. All in all, the mission is to boost awareness of problem gambling and how gambling harm can pervade every walk of life.</p>
<p>EPIC has also been working on a global scale, having recently joined with Entain Foundation in the United States to collaborate with Major League Soccer in seeking to promote safer and responsible gambling.</p>
