<p>The voting on the potential changes to the Association's reinstatement guidelines for athletes that gambled was postponed by two weeks</p>
<p>Considering the expansion of legal sports betting that is already available in more than 30 US states, concerns about the integrity of sports competitions continue to grow. Earlier this year, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) announced a number of suspensions over alleged gambling violations.</p>
<p>Then, earlier this month, the NCAA confirmed its plans to revise the penalties for athletes suspended due to sports wagering. The proposed changes to the guidelines sought to change the penalties for athletes who have placed bets on sports but did not wager on their team. While earlier this month, the NCAA Committee on Student-Athlete Reinstatement confirmed the new guidelines, now, the policies face a delay, as announced by The Des Moines Register.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the NCAA Division I Council Coordination Committee confirmed that the voting on the changes to the reinstatement guidelines will be delayed for two weeks. According to the Committee’s chair, Jon Steinbrecher, this decision came after the Conference Commissioners Association Executive Committee asked for more time. He said that the two-week delay would be used for collecting membership feedback for the planned changes. Finally, Steinbrecher pointed out: “The coordination committee reemphasized the need for the Association to move deliberately and have in-depth conversations about the current wagering landscape.”</p>
<p>“The council agreed with commissioners earlier this month that the penalties for wagering violations in limited circumstances should be adjusted and the respective committees moved quickly to recommend possible changes. However, the Conference Commissioners Association Executive Committee, today, requested a brief delay to allow more time for membership feedback on the proposed adjustment, and the coordination committee voted to honor that request.“ Jon Steinbrecher, chair of the NCAA Division I Council Coordination Committee</p>
<p>Proposed Changes May Ease Penalties for First-Time Offenders</p>
<p>Recently, the NCAA showed support for changes to betting legislation across the country. At the time, the Association confirmed that it plans to collaborate with lawmakers, ensuring the integrity of its competitions and raising awareness of problem gambling.</p>
<p>Additionally, the NCAA said that it plans to protect students from harassment and coercion. In the recently proposed changes to the reinstatement guidelines, the Association explores the option to reinstate penalized athletes if it’s their first offense. Such athletes would have the option to compete but must undergo education. Still, it’s important to mention that this rule would apply only to athletes who have placed sports bets but not on their team.</p>
<p>Back in August, Noah Shannon, the defensive tackle for Iowa Hawkeyes was suspended for a season. After a month, his appeal was denied. While there is a chance for Shannon to return, it is still uncertain if and when he may return, considering the planned changes to the reinstatement guidelines.</p>
