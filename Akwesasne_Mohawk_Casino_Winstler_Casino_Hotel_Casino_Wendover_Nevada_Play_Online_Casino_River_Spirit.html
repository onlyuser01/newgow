<p>Manchester United Looking Unstoppable Right Now</p>
<p>The Red Devils have been playing sensational soccer since the start of 2023. So far this year, they’ve won 10 matches in all competitions, while also drawing three, and losing only one game. The loss in question happened to Premier League leaders Arsenal in London.</p>
<p>At home, however, Erik ten Haag’s men are without a single defeat since September. In fact, they’re 14-1-0 in their last 15 home games. The last time they played at home, we saw them destroy Leicester City 3-0. Marcus Rashford scored twice that day, which isn’t surprising given how this guy’s been playing lately.</p>
<p>Rashford has scored at least a goal in each of his previous five games, including the one with Barcelona last Thursday.</p>
<p>Barcelona Won’t Back Down Easily</p>
<p>Same as Manchester United, Barcelona too has been amazing over the last couple of weeks. In fact, Xavi’s boys are in an even better run than the Red Devils, with 10 wins, three draws, and no losses in 2023.</p>
<p>They even played very well against Man United last week, but it was an own goal by Jules Kounde that caused trouble for them. They did show resilience, however, despite going 2-1 down, which paid off in the 76th minute of the game when Raphinha scored the equalizer on an assist by Kounde.</p>
<p>They fought until the end in that match, and we think they’re going to do the same this time as well even if things don’t go as planned at the start.</p>
<p>Manchester United vs Barcelona Prediction</p>
<p>Neither team is afraid to attack, which means that we’re probably going to witness one hell of a game on Thursday. The Red Devils have a slight edge over Barca in our opinion, considering that the game is played on their turf. Still, Barcelona’s roster is packed with talent, meaning that anything can happen.</p>
<p>We do, however, think this game is going to be very similar to the one played last week. We’re probably going to see plenty of goals, but it wouldn’t surprise us if the game finished in a draw.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester United and Barcelona to draw</p>
