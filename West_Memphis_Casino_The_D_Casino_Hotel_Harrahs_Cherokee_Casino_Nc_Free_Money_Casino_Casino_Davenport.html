<p>Back on May 4, 1998, the Nashville Predators became the 27th team to join the National Hockey League (NHL). Since then, the popularity of the team has grown immensely and the franchise has seen significant success in recent seasons. Now, the Tennessee-based team inked a new partnership with the global casino-entertainment company Bally’s Corporation.</p>

<p>The new deal between Bally’s and Predators is the first partnership with an NHL franchise for the global gaming giant. Moreover, the new collaboration marks the company’s first deal with a professional sports team in Tennessee. Under the deal, Bally’s became an Official Sports Betting Partner for the Predators. Additionally, Bally’s is now the Official Free-to-Play Partner of the franchise. Under the deal which is set to run through 2025, Bally’s gained access to Nashville Predators intellectual property rights.

<p>A New Free-To-Play Game Will Commemorate the Deal</p>

The game will be available on both iOS and Android and will give Predators fans a chance to win unique prizes.

<p>Then, the top competitor after each game will receive a prize. Moreover, at the end of the season, grand prizes will be distributed to Predators’ fans that had the highest scores. The launch of Smashville Selector continues Bally’s line of dynamic mobile sports apps.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company released the real-money sports betting app Bally Bet in Colorado and Iowa. Additionally, the company has also launched a free-to-play game dubbed Bally Sports Trivia. The company revealed that Smashville Selector is expected to launch in Tennessee in 2022.</p>

Moreover, he acknowledged that the team’s Bridgestone Arena offers an incredible atmosphere. Last but not least, Dhandhania said that marketing Bally’s at the arena will be great, “especially when combined with Predators game broadcasts on Bally Sports South.”</p>
