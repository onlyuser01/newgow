<p>After smashing a couple of terminals at a Betfred venue in Bournemouth, UK, the man responsible for the damages was sentenced to prison. Besides the damages, the man had three other criminal offenses and his overall sentence is 18 weeks in prison.</p>
<p>A Man Receives Sentence of 18 Weeks in Prison over Multiple Offenses</p>
<p>A man was playing at betting machines at a Betfred venue on Poole Road, Westbourne, Bournemouth, UK. It was all going well until he got upset over gaming losses and started smashing the machines. While this happened last year in the summer, the man was caught by the police and is now going to jail. As revealed by the Bournemouth Echo, the 25-year-old Emiljan Gjelaj appeared in court last week on Thursday.</p>
<p>The man caused some £1,360 in damages to the betting terminals at the Betfred venue. He admitted to those damages while appearing at Poole Magistrates’ Court. Speaking for the police, the employees of the bookmaker said that after the incident they felt “very distressed”. Although the incident occurred in July last year and the local police released CCTV footage, the man was apprehended last week.</p>
<p>While driving his blue Audi, Mr. Gjelaj caught the attention of the police. The police then discovered that the man has been driving without a driver’s license and while disqualified. Furthermore, they found that his vehicle did not have insurance. Consequently, he was apprehended and appeared in front of District Judge Stephen Nicholls.</p>
<p>The young man’s offenses included the damage of the betting terminals, an assault, relating to a separate incident, breach of a previous sentence, and possession of controlled substances. Adding to this, the police caught him driving without a driver’s license, while disqualified and without insurance.</p>
<p>Although the defendant did not receive a fine or penalty over the offenses for driving without a license and insurance, for the other offenses Judge Nicholls sentenced him to 18 weeks in prison. Furthermore, Mr. Gjelaj was disqualified from driving for additional 15 months and was ordered to pay a fine.</p>
