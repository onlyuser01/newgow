<p>Jackpocket is continuing to solidify its presence in the United States, with the company determined to be seen as the go-to lottery app in the entire country, and possibly beyond. To this end, Jackpocket has appointed Kelly Gillease, an experienced C-level executive as its newest Senior Advisor for the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Gillease will offer invaluable assistance to the company in helping it navigate through the next chapter of Jackpocket’s growth journey. Jackpocket has been laser-focused on bolstering its long-term marketing goals and sustaining its rapid expansion in both operational results as well as products. All of which will now be enhanced by Gillease’s appointment.</p>
<p>Speaking of Gillease as an individual, she is well-versed in brand-building and marketing endeavors and will undoubtedly play an important role in Jackpocket’s long-term ambitions. She has more than 20 years of working at a number of companies, including Viator, TripAdvisor, StudyBlue, and others, having focused on developing startup companies and making sure that they establish their good name.</p>
<p>She recently served as Chief Marketing Officer at NerdWallet, doing a four-year stint with the company, and she has been repeatedly praised for her expertise in developing multi-channel marketing initiatives. Gillease was connected with the company’s Initial Public Offering in 2021 as well. Gillease herself was excited to be joining the company in her advisory role:</p>
<p>"It's been amazing to watch Jackpocket's rapid growth in the digital lottery space over the last decade. Now, I'm excited to help the team push the company forward in its mission to create the best lottery and gaming experiences for consumers across the country."</p>
<p>Her appointment was similarly welcomed by Jackpocket founder and CEO Peter Sullivan who was similarly pleased to see the new senior advisor join in. Sullivan said that he was confident that Gillease’s input will help the company continue to develop its marketing and growth objectives and realize them.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jackpocket has been doing rather well over the past years. The company managed to expand rapidly throughout 2022 and it is determined to continue with this growth in 2023. Presently, the company is available in 16 states in the United States and Jackpocket users have collectively won more than $275m.</p>
<p>Jackpocket recently expanded its services through a partnership with Lottery Courier App, a leading third party for the purchase of lottery tickets.</p>
