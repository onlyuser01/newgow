    <h1>Casino St Ignace Golden Nugget Casino Bonus Code Osage Casino Hotel Casino On Strip In Las Vegas Los</h1>

<p>The deal will expand Push Gaming’s presence in the Nordics while reinforcing Chanz as a leading local brand</p>
<p>Push Gaming, a business-to-business provider of gaming content, has signed a multi-market deal with the gambling operator Chanz. As agreed, the former company will supply content to its new partner in several markets.</p>
<p>The partnership will see Push Gaming integrate its entire portfolio of casino games into Chanz’s platform, thus expanding its reach in Denmark, Estonia and Sweden. As a result, players in those markets will get to play some of Push Gaming’s best titles, including hits such as Fat Rabbit and Jammin’ Jars.</p>
<p>What makes Chanz different from other casinos is the social element it adds to the casino experience. Thanks to that, the operator has quickly solidified its position as a fast-growing brand in multiple regulated markets.</p>
<p>The deal will expand Push Gaming’s overall footprint, helping it increase its presence in the Nordics. The arrangement is the latest in a string of agreements with notable operators. Some of the supplier’s latest moves include deals with companies such as Pokerstars, Sky Bet and ComeOn Group.</p>
<p>Push Gaming continues to expand its global presence thanks to its focused commercial development.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Benefit the Two Companies</p>
<p>Fiona Hickey, Push Gaming’s director of new business and markets, commented on the deal with Chanz, sharing her excitement about partnering with the operator.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be partnering with Chanz. The social focus of its operations aligns with our distinctive portfolio and player-led mentality. Fiona Hickey, director of new business and markets, Push Gaming</p>
<p>Hickey added that the Nordic markets are an important region for Push Gaming. Expanding the company’s presence there means that more players than ever before will have access to the developer’s industry-defining games, Hickey said. She concluded that Push Gaming is certain its games will prove popular in the region.</p>
<p>Nicholas Erola, Chanz’s games manager, also commented on the deal saying that European players tend to prefer casinos with a social aspect and a varied selection of content. The partnership with Push Gaming will provide Erola’s company with more games to offer to its players, helping it engage more gamblers with socially-charged experiences.</p>
<p>Partnering with Push Gaming represents a milestone within our content provision, as we now offer some of the market’s most revered, award-winning titles for players to enjoy. Nicholas Erola, games manager, Chanz</p>
<p>Recently, Push Gaming won the GamblingNews silverware in the category for Most Watched &amp; Most Streamed Slot Award for May in the Tier 2 Category for a second time this year.</p>
<p>In May, Push Gaming was acquired by MGM Resorts’ LeoVegas subsidiary.</p>
