    <h1>Casino Grand Portage Fort Randall Casino Hotel Renaissance Curacao Resort Casino Willemstad Orleans</h1>

<p>I won $396,994.10USD(598,197.86Aud) tried to withdraw 1000ltc &amp; because of past experience with the platform I started doing some large bets hoping they left me alone but then I got kicked from site for a 72hours with the false pretence of routine security checks and verification, tho I was we’ll verified plus had my vip host etc. came back and all my money was gone plus probably $6000 of bonuses. They said it was a glitch. BUT the week before that I was playing coin flip and pressed tails but lost when it landed on tails, I told them and showed them the recordings and they said probably a screen glitch but it doesn’t affect the outcome. They were cheating and manipulative for ages. It’s enough to drive a person insane. Insane enough to think on how one would be able to cause enough problem for the whole of Curaçao’s government and the master licenses to feel pressure from other governments. I wrote to kabinet, gcbc &amp; CIL. Cil reckon BCGAME said they’d provided me with detail explanation of issue and so on. But no they did not, they only sent the supposed explanation 12hrs after cil had emailed me. They said very little besides they corrected bets, meaning they cleaned out my account, bonus money &amp; tried taking any other tokens I hadn’t even been recently betting with. I could go on all day but that’s the gist.</p>
<p>They refunded my 1000tc withdrawal back to my bc account then siphoned what they could besides whatever I spent on third party games then took what they could being $ 247,894.39USD Plus a few extra thousand USD in bonuses</p>
<p>SBGOK is currently assisting. We’ve sent a reminder for their reply to our demand letter</p>
