    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Fort Lauderdale Florida Casinos In Las Vegas Nevada Diamond Jim S Ca</h1>

<p>Real-time data streaming and messaging solutions provider Push Technology announced its promotion of Grethe Brown to the position of CEO. Brown joined Push earlier this year as COO.</p>
<p>Brown Has Solid Management Experience in Various Industries</p>
<p>“It is a tremendous honor to be appointed CEO of Push Technology at such an exciting time,” stated Brown and expressed her commitment to helping the company maintain the momentum from its 2021 successes. She recognized the need to focus on clients’ requirements and aid them in their digital transformation initiatives.</p>
<p>The new CEO has extensive commercial management experience for young, high-tech companies in various industries such as telecommunications, Food &amp; Beverage, and FinTech. She focused on driving growth and increasing market share. In one of her previous positions, Brown reportedly managed to grow a FinTech company’s revenue by 300% over 24 months. She holds an MBA from the University of Surrey and a BSc in mathematics from the University of Linkoping.</p>
<p>John Pocock, Executive Chairman at Push Technology, expressed his approval regarding the new appointment. He lauded Brown’s vast experience and expertise and noted that she had already made a noticeable impact despite her short time with the company. Pocock proceeded to say that there was “no better person to lead Push Technology than Grethe,” as the B2B provider sought to continue its global expansion and aggressive growth.</p>
<p>Push’s Products Have Received Multiple International Awards</p>
<p>Brown is assuming control during a favorable period for Push. The UK-based company’s latest Diffusion Intelligent Event-Data Platform received significant acclaim and won several awards across several diverse sectors. Its purpose is to allow clients to build new data processing applications or improve legacy systems without requiring prior knowledge of the software. The system efficiently delivers real-time data and can be tailored to the requirements of each specific business.</p>
<p>Diffusion won the TradingTech Insights award for “Best Cloud-Based Market Data Delivery Solution” and earned the title of “Best Innovation in Data Technologies” at Europe’s DEVIES Awards, among others. The technology was also shortlisted during multiple other events and is currently Push’s signature product.</p>
<p>The company has reaffirmed its continued drive to constant innovation and commitment to continue supplying its customers with scalable, real-time event-data solutions.</p>
