<p>Michigan has received the green light for joining the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement. Thanks to this, Michigan’s poker players who use one of the regulated operators will be allowed to play against competitors from other states that are part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Michigan Shares Liquidity with Three Other States</p>
<p>The Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement currently covers four states in total, those being Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, and now Michigan. It was established in 2014, following the passing of a pair of Assembly Bills in Nevada. After that, Nevada and Delaware began sharing liquidity among online players.</p>
<p>The Multi-State Internet Gaming Association, a regulatory body based in Delaware, later approved New Jersey as well. In 2017, the Garden State became the third member of the agreement.</p>
<p>Michigan’s foundations for joining the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement were placed in January 2021 when Senate Bill 911 was passed. It permitted the cross-border exchange of information and gaming data, allowing Michigan to share online poker liquidity with other states.</p>
<p>With the Great Lake State now a part of the agreement, its poker players will now be able to freely play with competitors from Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey. As of now, Michigan, just like Nevada, has opted to only share online poker, while New Jersey and Delaware’s agreements include other online casino games as well.</p>
<p>Rebecca Satterfield, who serves as the manager of the Multi-State Internet Gaming Association and the internet gaming manager of Delaware’s Lottery, has welcomed Michigan into the agreement.</p>
<p>She pointed out that Michigan’s decision to join the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement has paved the way for the state’s almost 10 million residents to enjoy a full array of interactive gaming together with competitors from the association’s member states. Satterfield added that the association is ready to welcome more members:</p>
<p>“The association continues to be forward-thinking and welcomes the interest of additional gaming jurisdictions in becoming party to the agreement.” Multi-State Internet Gaming Association manager Rebecca Satterfield</p>
<p>The decision to join the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement was always the next logical step in the evolution of Michigan online gambling. The state’s iGaming sector has been enjoying great interest from local bettors, much to the dismay of retail companies. The February 2022 report demonstrated that many residents of Michigan seem to be attracted by the convenience of online gambling, causing losses for the land-based sector and record-high revenues for its online counterpart.</p>
<p>Interest in iGaming and poker continues to grow. A week ago, the World Series of Poker launched in Michigan and brought great online offerings to poker enthusiasts.</p>
