<p>Robyn Slot Review</p>
<p>Robyn is a 5×3 video slot released by Genesis Gaming in 2014. The game counts 243 ways to win and carries players on a fairytale adventure. If you are a fan of the genre and you are eager to join a young huntress looking for her village’s land and riches taken by the evil Queen while scooping up big wins, give the game a try.</p>
<p>Robyn is compatible with both desktop computers and mobile devices, it counts two separate bonus features including free spins, and it offers feisty fun gameplay. If you are looking to learn more about this game inspired by fantasy novels and Disney-Pixar movies, keep reading our expert review for it.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Hunt Down the Evil Queen</p>
<p>The game revolves around Robyn, a beautiful teen princess with blonde hair and blue eyes. The action was inspired by a number of fantasy stories, fairy tales, and popular Disney-Pixar releases most players of the game are likely to be familiar with. More precisely, the Robyn character with her bow and arrow and fierce look in her eyes was inspired by Merida from the movie Brave.</p>
<p>Robyn is accompanied by her smiling horse ready to lead her through the dark and mystical forest which represents the backdrop of the game. While searching for her prince, Robyn is also seen trying to fight the evil Queen and retrieve the land and treasures that the latter has stolen from her village.</p>
<p>The second the reels start to spin, the game sends players straight into an intriguing and mysterious atmosphere with the help of cool graphics that immediately pop off the screen and grab all the attention of lovers of the genre.</p>
<p>Robyn: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game’s highest-paying symbol is represented by none other than the main character, Robyn. The rest of the high-paying symbols are represented by the evil-looking queen, the prince with a huge grin on his face, and Robyn’s faithful horse. The low-paying symbols are the standard card symbols found in the great majority of online slots. However, what sets Robyn apart is the inclusion of the Target symbol during the base game.</p>
<p>Acting as a wild symbol, the Target can occasionally be seen popping on any location on the reels, causing Robyn to get out from the bushes where she was hiding at the bottom of a screen and proceed to fire an arrow at the target eventually destroying it and replacing it with a random non-scatter symbol.</p>
<p>In other words, the target symbol works like a regular wild symbol but it also features an added element of randomness, which is just what the gameplay needs to stay interesting and engaging for players looking for a fun twist.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>In spite of being released in 2014, Genesis Gaming’s slot does not feature any of the static symbols and rather boring slot animations you might expect from a game with such a long lifespan on the market. On the contrary, the skilled and talented crew behind it ran the extra mile for its players, injecting it with a lot of personality and charm. This is immediately visible the second the reels begin to spin. While the game might lack an ongoing soundtrack to support the action on the reels, an upbeat adventure-themed cheer is heard.</p>
<p>Robyn Gameplay</p>
<p>Click the question mark at the bottom of the screen to get all the information you need about the rules of the game and the paytable, place your bets and start spinning the reels.</p>
<p>A combination of three, four, or five identical high-paying symbols will trigger various payouts. As expected, the list is led by the Robyn symbol. Matching three, four, or five Robyn symbols on the reel will trigger 50, 500, and 1,000 payouts.</p>
<p>Landing three, four, or five white horse symbols will bring payouts of 25, 250, and 750, respectively. Next in line are the evil Queen symbols that will reward players with payouts of 20, 100, and 500 for matching three, four, or five identical symbols. The charming prince symbol will trigger a payout of 15, 100, or 250 of three, four, or five matching symbols.</p>
<p>The Scatter, which is also the logo of the slot, attracts payouts of 50, 100, and 1000 coins for three, four, or five matching symbols. Scatter symbols will also engage free spins while changing all target symbols into wild symbols, but more on this in the next section of our review.</p>
<p>Robyn: Frenetic Free Spins</p>
<p>Players who manage to land a minimum of three scatters will activate this feature and get to enjoy 12 free spins when appearing in the right configuration. When the free spins are engaged, the Target symbol is shot and replaced by a wild symbol that will then replace the rest of the symbols found in the base game. Scatter symbols can also pop up again while the free spins are still triggered, thus bringing players 12 more free games to keep the gameplay going.</p>
<p>The game offers players 243 ways to win, which means all the pay lines automatically become active once a player places a bet. This means players do not need to concern themselves about having to decide which lines they should play next for higher chances of scoring a win. Instead, they can keep things sweet and simple and enjoy the game as it unfolds on the grid.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Robyn by Genesis Gaming was released for mobile players in its HTML5 version at the same time when the original game saw the light of day in online casinos fueled by the provider almost a decade ago. To this day, players can either opt for the classic online version or the mobile variant for gameplay on the go and enjoy the same quality graphics, engaging play, and rewarding payouts with zero hassle.</p>
<p>If you don’t mind the cartoonish-style fantasy theme and you are a fan of simple gameplay with satisfying wins, Robyn might be the right game for you.</p>
