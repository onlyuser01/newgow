<p>Greentube has taken its partnership with CashBet to the next level by adding CashBet Coin cryptocurrency as a payment option within its B2C social casino network.</p>
<p>Greentube Has Finalized the Deal for Cryptocurrency with Cashbet</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC Interactive’s iGaming brand Greentube has struck a deal with CashBet Coin and will now offer the CBC cryptocurrency as a payment method within Greentube’s social casino network.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce the finalization of our partnership with a subsidiary and part of NOVOMATIC Interactive division, Greentube! #igaming #cashbet #geentubehttps://t.co/mKQynpEo2n — CashBet Coin (@CashBetCoin) December 10, 2019</p>
<p>Greentube’s GameTwist is one of the world’s largest online gambling networks that includes more than 400 casinos with various types of games. Founded in 2012, CashBet, is currently headquartered in California and is licensed by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission and the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC).</p>
<p>Similarly, GameTwist targets European markets, allowing Greentube and CashBet to achieve synergies in heavily-regulated markets such as the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The company’s goal is to create a world-reaching blockchain-powered platform powering a rich ecosystem of online casinos.</p>
<p>According to CashBet Coin President, Ed Brennan, Greentube has been implementing CBC, offering it as an alternative payment option across the company’s gambling market globally.</p>
<p>He thinks that the partnership with Greentube emphasizes the need for a different payment method in the sphere of online gaming and CBC turns out to be a good solution to that end.</p>
<p>The Cryptocurrency Deal Comes as a Result of a 2-Year Partnership</p>
<p>Previously, Greentube and CashBet struck a deal in 2018, with the new agreement serving as an extension of the ongoing partnership..</p>
<p>As a result, Greentube’s customers can now buy credits with CashBet Coin and use it as an additional option to bet with on online games such as slots, casino, bingo and card games available across Greentube’s gaming network.</p>
<p>Greentube CCO, Roland van den Brink also shared his satisfaction with the deal.</p>
<p>Brink stated that with this step the company’s partnership with CBC has been taken to the next level and underlined the fact that CashBet Coin’s cryptocurrency fully corresponds to Greentube’s strategy to leverage blockchain solutions in the aim of helping their customers have a better experience.</p>
<p>“The technical excellence, demonstrable utility, and versatility of CBC perfectly aligns with our vision for cryptocurrency in social gaming,” he said.</p>
<p>Why Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies?</p>
<p>Blockchain gaming has been spreading with multiple casinos around the world adopting similar solutions. Apart from Bitcoin, companies have established multiple altcoins across a number of projects on the TRON network.</p>
<p>Bethereum, Bitcasino.io and BitStarz are just a handful of top-shelf brands to have successfully leveraged blockchain technology in iGaming.</p>
<p>Certain platforms, including Bethereum, have market themselves as social gaming experiences, creating an open platform and community. There has been a correlation about the perceived transparency of a platform and its success with forming a community.</p>
<p>CashBet Coin is the latest crypto solution to has been successfully integrated in the mainstream. Other popular crypto payment options include Litecoin, Ethereum, and of course Bitcoin.</p>
