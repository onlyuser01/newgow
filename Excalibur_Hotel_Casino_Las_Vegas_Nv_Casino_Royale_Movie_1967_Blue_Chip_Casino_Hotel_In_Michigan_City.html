<p>Peter Sell, 61 is charged with three counts of sexual assault and a single count of kidnapping and battery with intent to commit sexual assault, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. If convicted on all charges, he could face decades in prison.</p>
<p>Early in the morning on Aug. 3, Metro police were notified of a report that a victim was sexually assaulted and covered in blood, according to a recently released police report.</p>
<p>Sell had just met the woman and the two went for drinks at a bar inside the Aria Resort &amp; Casino. He then asked her to go to his hotel room at the Paris.</p>
<p>But after they got there, the duo got into a dispute about prices for sex. The confrontation soon turned violent, police said. Sell strangled her, assaulted her in the face, and sexually assaulted the woman, police said, based on the victim’s statements.</p>
<p>“Sell punched her in the face approximately 30 times,” the police report revealed.</p>
<p>Recording of Assault Found</p>
<p>When investigating the case, Metro police were able to locate a possibly relevant recording made by another hotel guest.</p>
<p>In it, a woman is heard yelling the words “please help,” authorities said. She further told security staff a man was attempting to kill her, the recording revealed.</p>
<p>When police officers talked to Sell, he told them he was so intoxicated he did not remember the argument, the report said. But he recalled the fight with the woman, police add.</p>
<p>Sell was released from custody after posting a $25,000 bond. A condition of his release is that he visits Las Vegas once a week to report to court officials.</p>
<p>He is next scheduled to appear in court before a judge on Sept. 8. The victim told police she came to Las Vegas to work as a sex worker. She is originally from Nebraska.</p>
<p>Earlier Las Vegas Sex Assault</p>
<p>In May Frank Anthony Ruggirello, 43, of Clinton, Mich. allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino.</p>
<p>But Ruggirello said the sex was consensual. He says the two shared a room and had dinner, drink, and attended a show together. But when they got back to the hotel room, she went to sleep. While asleep, she claims he assaulted her, the Review-Journal said.</p>
