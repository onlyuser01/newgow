<p>The confidence is high in the locker room of the Liberty Flames, who have been brilliant under coach Jamey Chadwell. With him in charge, they won every single game they played in 2023.</p>
<p>We saw them go 13-0 in the Conference USA, with their most recent game seeing them beat New Mexico State for the conference title.</p>
<p>These guys were brilliant offensively in 2023, scoring 40.8 points per game on average. That makes the Flames the No. 5 offense in the nation. The Flames are 1st in the nation when it comes to rushing yards per game with 302.9 yards on average.</p>
<p>Their running back Quinton Cooley looks like someone who’s got a very bright future in the NFL. This guy will have to put on a real good show on January 1 in the 2024 Fiesta Bowl because his team is taking on one of the best defenses in the nation.</p>
<p>Can Oregon’s Defense Stop Liberty?</p>
<p>The Ducks are the eighth-highest-ranked college football team in the US, going 11-2 in 2023. Noth of their losses happened to the Washington Huskies, who are the No. 2 team in the nation.</p>
<p>However, they’ve been doing great against teams ranked outside the top 10. In 2023, we saw them win against Oregon State, USC, Arizona State, and many others.</p>
<p>Their offense has been good constantly for (at least) the past 12 months, with their average being 41.1 PPG. When it comes to their defense, they’re 12th in the nation, allowing 18.2 points per game on average.</p>
<p>Liberty Flames vs. Oregon Ducks 2024 Fiesta Bowl</p>
<p>The Oregon Ducks are just better than the Liberty Flames, which is why they’re favored to win the 2024 Fiesta Bowl. We think they’re going to win it, but we don’t think they’re going to have an easy job on January 1.</p>
<p>The Flames are great when it comes to running the ball and their defense is alright as well. Although they don’t look capable of winning, we can definitely see them covering the 17-point spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Liberty Flames +17.0</p>
