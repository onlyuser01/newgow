<p>The iGaming software provider, Swintt, announced a new partnership with the leading aggregator for the online gambling industry, Pariplay.</p>
<p>Pariplay Joins Forces with Swintt</p>
<p>Details of the new deal announced Monday will see Swintt’s leading content portfolio become available for Pariplay’s leading aggregation platform, Fusion. Thanks to the latest deal, the leading iGaming developer’s Premium and Select titles will be available via the aggregation platform. As a result of the new deal, Pariplay partners will have access to popular hits from Swintt’s wide range of content.</p>
<p>This new collaboration will bring the developer’s Premium slots such as Extra Win X, Cleopatras Diamonds and Master of Books for customers of the aggregation platform. The popular Extra Win X title offers a unique multiplier that can award the players a prize of up to 800x of their wager via random expanding symbols. On the other hand, Master of Books and Cleopatras Diamonds leverage Swintt’s popular Free Spins feature via expanding symbols.</p>
<p>In addition to Premium slots, the collaboration will bring the developer’s Select games for Pariplay customers. Such titles include the smashing hit Aloha Spirit XtraLockTM, as well Monster Disco XtraHoldTM, two tiles from Swintt’s “Xtra” game series. What’s more, Pariplay platform customers will get blockbuster-style games such as The Crown with the famous footballer and actor Vinnie Jones.</p>
<p>The New Deal Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Pariplay’s director of partnerships, Callum Harris, said that the company is focused on expanding its Fusion platform by adding top titles from leading developers. He acknowledged that Swintt is the perfect fit for the operators’ aggregator platform, considering it further boosts the company’s platform offering. Last but not least, Harris acknowledged that Swintt’s titles deliver unique themes and features that cannot be found anywhere else.</p>
<p>“We are constantly adding titles from the best up-and-coming software suppliers to tour Fusion’s platform portfolio.“ Callum Harris, director of partnerships at Pariplay</p>
<p>The new collaboration further solidifies Pariplay’s position as the #1 aggregator and content provider for the growing online gambling industry. In fact, currently, the company offers more than 14,000 game titles within 20 different regulated markets globally, taking more than €1 billion ($1.03 billion) in monthly bets.</p>
<p>“At Swintt, one of our major aspirations has always been to share our award-winning collection of games with customers in as many regulated markets as possible – and through this huge new deal with Pariplay, we’ll now be able to do just that.“ David Mann, CEO at Swintt</p>
<p>According to Swintt’s CEO, David Mann, a main goal for the company is to expand its reach and deliver its leading content to more customers around the globe. Now, he added that the new deal with Pariplay complements this goal and expands the company’s reach. Mann acknowledged that Pariplay is among the biggest aggregators in the industry which makes this deal a major step for Swintt. Finally, he said that the company is looking forward to seeing the success the new deal will bring.</p>
