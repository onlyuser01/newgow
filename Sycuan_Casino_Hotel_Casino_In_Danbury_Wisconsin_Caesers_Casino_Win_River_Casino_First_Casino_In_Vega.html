    <h1>Sycuan Casino Hotel Casino In Danbury Wisconsin Caesers Casino Win River Casino First Casino In Vega</h1>

<p>I got a bonus of 300 free spins at Spinnite.com. Deposit was â‚¬ 20.</p>
<p>I think the free spins turned into â‚¬ 30 or something and it was a 200% bonus, so after depositing with free spins and the 200% bonus of â‚¬ 90 on top, everything was cool until then.</p>
<p>I started to play and also won so that in the end I also managed to convert this immense sum, so the profit amounted to 398 REAL money at the end when I had implemented it or wanted to make my payout.</p>
<p>So and now the problems are already starting I like to convince myself whenever I have won something in the support chat for the purpose of KYC and whether everything is cool and I can look forward to my win. But here comes the first strange case in the support chat I was told I was already "verieziert" which was NOT true, so I had never sent documents to this site because I had registered myself on that day of the win, but it got me not really perturbed at the moment but that makes it now that I have received this e-mail I attach the text here:</p>
<p>"Hello Stephanie ***,</p>
<p>Your account has been determined to be in breach of Section 7 of the Welcome Offer Promotional Terms:</p>
<p>Section 7: The maximum allowed stake while using the welcome bonus is â‚¬ 5. Should you make a higher bet while using the welcome bonus, the casino reserves the right to withhold all winnings.</p>
<p>As a result, your payout was canceled, your winnings were retained and your deposit of â‚¬ 20 was credited to your customer account.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Account team</p>
<p>So and I can guarantee 100% that I have not made ONE bet over the said 5 â‚¬ the highest bet I play was in book of dead with 2.50 â‚¬ and I know that I tried once the emphasis is on "tried" Buying 100 cards worth 10 cents from evolution gaming's megaball was immediately canceled because of the â‚¬ 5 limit and then only played 3 rounds or so with â‚¬ 5, and not over the â‚¬ 5 once had 75 cent, unfortunately I don't know the second win but the last one was 4.30 â‚¬, from then on I am out again and have continued to play in the slots.</p>
<p>Up to the last said â‚¬ 2.50 lathe until I was on â‚¬ 398 on my account, I then asked for the payment on 09/30/2020 at 8:41 (I think that's a GMT time) and today it was almost 50H later This e-mail was sent, whereupon I immediately went to the support where I was told that you can't do it there, since you are a different department, I should reply to the e-mail, I did that where I did again what is talked about by 48 h response times !! So I see a very clear fraud from the Slotnite.com side even if you look at the time periods, how they act I was told, for example, on wednesday (day of the win) that it is 48 hours until the money is processed So at most today I was told in support because at 9 o'clock I asked why nothing had happened in the last 48 hours because I was suddenly told that the first payouts are at 72 hours and not 48 hours ðŸ˜€ I also have again thought boor what kind of game the bums play, but okay it doesn't matter I thought to myself and wait until monday or tuesday until the money is there.</p>
<p>Yes and the end of the song was then the e-mail that you put into the text, the e-mail came btw at 12:42, almost 3 hours after my question why it was not processed after 48 hours and then what was told about 72 hours ...</p>
<p>I would be really happy if you could maybe do something there.I even had my birthday on this one and it was a really great gift but now the sadness is great, especially since I needed the money urgently because it came from a difficult life sitiution can help and now everything should be gone, the 20 â‚¬ are already gone, unfortunately I gambled away out of frustration and thought I turn to you with this request, you probably have means and options that I do not have because what it looks like the profit away and with it my mood.</p>
<p>Lg stepahnie ***</p>
<p>Ps I hope the text was understandable</p>
