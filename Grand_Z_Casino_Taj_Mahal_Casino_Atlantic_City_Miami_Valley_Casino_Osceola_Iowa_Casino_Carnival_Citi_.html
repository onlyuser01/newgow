    <h1>Grand Z Casino Taj Mahal Casino Atlantic City Miami Valley Casino Osceola Iowa Casino Carnival Citi</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Again, I was TOLD by your representative Karin to create a new account. Would you like me to resend her email to you?</p>
<p>Yous have broke your own rules, as yous have a self exclusion system that doesn't work. Yous are also the ones that offered me bonuses to continue to play with yous even though yous were fully aware I have a gambling addiction and had issues with your site.</p>
<p>My strategy? This is ridiculous, I've told yous I have an addiction, I've supplied evidence of treatment as well as active things I've done to battle the addiction since 2019.</p>
<p>Your company has made harmful mistakes towards me being a vulnerable player and yous are accepting no responsibility for (A) your self exclusion system not working in May (B) 100s of attempts to self exclude via email and live chat ignored by yourselves and (C) offering me bonuses and instructing me to create a new account to receive them due to yous acknowledging yous didn't protect a vulnerable gambler with an addiction.</p>
<p>I really don't see how yous can argue in any way shape or form. It's quite simple, I asked for exclusion, was told to do it on settings and wait 5 days, I was able to sign in 7 days later because your system didn't work, that's YOUR fault.</p>
<p>Since then I was given a bonus to play because your system didn't work for exclusion and INSTRUCTED to create a new account. Again that's YOUR fault and extremely immoral given yous are fully aware I'm struggling with addiction.</p>
<p>Now yous are blaming me for creating a new account, even though YOUS instructed me to do so. You are saying you don't know how many accounts I have so how can you accuse me of having all these accounts if you don't know?</p>
<p>Honestly, I've never in my life had an experience like this where a company is so badly ran from top to bottom. There's zero accountability, and zero responsibility or empathy shown towards the vulnerable in society. All yous have done is prey upon me and the evidence is right there throughout everything.</p>
<p>I really hope justice is to be had as this is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>Casino Guru, I'd be intrigued to hear your thoughts on the latest developments and any further advice for me to take this case further as it's disgusting how this company has treated me and no doubt other vulnerable people.</p>
