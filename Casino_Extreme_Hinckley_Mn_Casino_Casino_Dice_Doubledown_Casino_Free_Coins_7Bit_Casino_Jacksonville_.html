<p>Jacksonville State Gamecocks Favored to Triumph in Their First-Ever Bowl</p>
<p>The Jacksonville State Gamecocks have never played a college bowl game in the program’s 99-year-long history. They moved to the Bowl Subdivision of the NCAAF this year, going 8-4 and becoming the first team in 26 years to make a bowl in its first season in the FBS.</p>
<p>That’s a great achievement, but there’s one thing that should worry them. These guys lost two of their last three games. Those losses happened to South Carolina (5-7) and New Mexico State (10-4), two teams with superb offensive teams.</p>
<p>But even against those opponents, Jacksonville’s defense did not embarrass itself. That’s something that’s giving the Gamecocks a lot of confidence ahead of the 2023 New Orleans Bowl.</p>
<p>Louisiana Ragin’ Cajuns Looking for Their 6th Win in the New Orleans Bowl</p>
<p>Michael Desormeaux’s team finished the 2023 NCAAF season with a 6-6 record (3-5 in Sun Belt Conference). They could’ve done better but their offense wasn’t too impressive.</p>
<p>Sure, they did score 52 points in their most recent game, but before that, they were somewhat disappointing. Their season average was 32.25 PPG, but in three of the last four games, they went under that number.</p>
<p>Truth be told, they had some really tough games in the remainder of the season – Troy (11-2), Arkansas State (6-6), and so on.</p>
<p>Jacksonville State Gamecocks vs. Louisiana Ragin’ Cajuns Prediction</p>
<p>Our 2023 New Orleans Bowl prediction is that this is going to be a very close game, probably with not too many points overall. Literally a single field goal could decide the winner on December 16.</p>
<p>Given that the Ragin’ Cajuns have one of the best kickers in college football – Kelvin Almendares who went 13-for-14 with field goals in 2023 – which is why they’re our pick.</p>
<p>Pick: Louisiana Ragin’ Cajuns (+130) &amp; Under 56.5 Points</p>
