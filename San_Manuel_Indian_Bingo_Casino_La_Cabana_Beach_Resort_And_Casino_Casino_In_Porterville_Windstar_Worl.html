<p>Pimp My Ride review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around the popular 2000s reality show Pimp My Ride.</p>
<p>Set in a glitzy and nostalgic Y2K world with vividly spray painted vehicles, this game is blast from the past. Accompanying the fleet of souped up cars are colourful card suits that seem to have redone paint jobs as well.</p>
<p>Players won’t need to be fans of the original show to enjoy the 2000s vibes and retro aesthetic. No car specific knowledge is necessary, but enjoying a good old flame-decorated hood will definitely help.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The Pimp My Ride logo will be familiar to anyone who remembers the 2000s with its trippy bubble letters and emblematic flames. From the start, players will know this is going to be an on brand experience.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a dance-worthy tune that adds a festive atmosphere. Players who would rather concentrate than boogie have the option to use the mute button.</p>
<p>The symbols include a range of brightly decorated cars to suit a variety of groovy tastes. Whether players prefer a lime green van or a fuschia pink cadillac, they’ll find an eccentric vehicle to fantasize about.</p>
<p>A selection of card suits glow in the reels and ensure that a little casino flavour is added to the TV show theme.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics and music create an entertaining vibe that brings the namesake show to life.</p>

<p>Pimp My Ride is a five reel, four row slot, with 30 win lines.</p>
<p>All symbols pay from left to right, excluding the Scatter symbol. Only the highest win will be awarded for a selected line.</p>
