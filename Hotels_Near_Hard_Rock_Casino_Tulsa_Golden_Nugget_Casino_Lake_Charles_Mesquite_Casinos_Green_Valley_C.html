<p>Italy’s leading gaming brands operator BLOX has teamed up with Habanero for additional top-tier gamification options.</p>
<p>Habanero Delivers Gaming Portfolio to BLOX</p>
<p>A developer of online table games and slots, Habanero has reinforced its Italian footprint with a new content partnership with BLOX, a local operator of gaming and betting brands which is one of the best-known faces in the Italian iGaming market.</p>
<p>With over 100 high-esteemed games, Habanero is reinforcing BLOX’s growing portfolio of high-performing products to which the provider is now adding its own expertise. As a result, Habanero will debut player-favorite games, such as Wild Trucks, Scopa and Jump! to name a few familiar choices.</p>
<p>Habanero’s world-class product is aimed at players from all backgrounds and the latest agreement is part of the company’s push to bring its portfolio to a global audience across numerous platforms, banking on the omni-channel experience and platform accessibility.</p>
<p>Habanero is already present in the country, but its most recent alliance with BLOX will allow the company to develop its reach and cement its presence with some of the company’s leading brands in the country.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, European Head of Business Development for Habanero, Arcangelo Lonoce said that the team was delighted to reinforce its B2C operations through the BLOX link-up. Lonoce had this to add:</p>
<p>“Over the course of 2020, we’ve expanded the appeal of our games amongst a wide variety of players in an international range of regulated markets, and plan to continue cementing our tier-one credentials in the year to come – and we look forward to another record-breaking 12 months.” -European Head of Business Development for Habanero, Arcangelo Lonoce</p>
<p>Habanero’s Continuous Growth</p>
<p>For his part, BLOX CCO Karl Grech welcomed the addition of Habanero’s celebrated catalogue and touted the developer’s reach across a variety of player bases and demographics, and the well-deserved position the supplier occupies within the industry.</p>
<p>Grech is confident that the sign-up with Habanero will only help further develop BLOX’s growing portfolio of gamification options. Habanero’s push in the Italian market has been going on for a while now.</p>
<p>In November, the company signed another partnership with LeoVegas, bringing its portfolio of slots and table games to yet another premier gaming brand in the country.</p>
<p>The company has not shied away from a challenge, doubling down its efforts in Germany’s newly-regulated market, and setting out on a mission to optimize its products to be compliant with local regulatory statures.</p>
<p>As part of the provider’s global expanse, Latin American markets have been targeted as well, guaranteeing a well-diversified market portfolio for the supplier.</p>
