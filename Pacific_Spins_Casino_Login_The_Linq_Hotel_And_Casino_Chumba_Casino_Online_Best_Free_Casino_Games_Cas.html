Slam Dunk Dollar$ is planned to run throughout the upcoming 2020-2021 NBA season. Furthermore, the new lottery game will also complement other team sport games that EquiLottery Games is offering.</p>

This makes four prize tiers with overall odds of 6 to 1. EquiLottery revealed that the system powering these games was completed earlier this year.
