<p>The recognition will further strengthen Mohegan's commitment to fostering a culture of excellence and innovation</p>
<p>Mohegan, the internationally recognized gaming and hospitality brand of the tribe from Connecticut, received another global recognition by entering Newsweek’s Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces list.</p>
<p>Creating a Culture of Value, Support and Empowerment</p>
<p>Mohegan ranked 85th in the 2023 Global Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces list prepared by Newsweek in collaboration with leadership development and benchmark research company, Best Practice Institute (BPI).</p>
<p>Mohegan’s chief people officer, Patricia Smith, commented on the news, thrilled to see Mohegan being “recognized as one of the most loved workplaces,” outlining the company’s priority of “creating a culture where team members feel valued, supported and empowered to contribute” to its mission.</p>
<p>“This recognition is a testament to our entire team’s hard work, dedication and commitment,” Smith added, using the occasion to announce that Mohegan plans to recruit an additional 2,000 team members for its Inspire Entertainment Resort in Korea.</p>
<p>The annual rankings list is prepared after surveying more than 2 million team members across businesses with a workforce from 30 to more than 10,000 members, recognizing those businesses which prioritize respect, caring and appreciation for their employees, and have earned the loyalty and respect of the people working for them.</p>
<p>Areas for Critical Assessment</p>
<p>The assessment measures team member sentiment across five critical areas: how workers feel about their future at the company, their career achievement, the level of employer-employee value alignment, respect at all levels, and collaboration at the workplace. Areas such as inclusion, diversity, equity, and company leadership were analyzed in relation to the five critical areas.</p>
<p>Hailing the “exciting result,” Mohegan’s president and chief executive officer, Ray Pineault, pointed out that this was the second major recognition for the business following its ranking among the Top 100 US Companies in 2022 and a testament to the company’s commitment “to fostering a positive and supportive workplace culture.”</p>
<p>“Guided by the Spirit of Aquai, which represents our way of being welcoming, cooperative, building relationships, and having mutual respect for others, we strive to create a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to do their best work,” he said.</p>
<p>Pineault concluded his comments by personally attesting as a member of the team for more than 20 years that the recognition received by the business would further strengthen the company’s “commitment to fostering a culture of excellence and innovation.”</p>
<p>‘Opportunities for Voices to Be Heard’</p>
<p>Mohegan employees highlighted that the firm offers “opportunities for voices to be heard by conducting team member engagement surveys, staff meetings, town halls and regular team member updates as well as Kaizen events and breakfast with the president.”</p>
<p>In terms of career advancement, Mohegan “offers transfer and promotion opportunities, stretch assignments, tuition reimbursement, in-house training programs, and off-site seminars to support employees in making career choices compatible with one’s unique skills, knowledge, personality and interests.”</p>
<p>Fellow US and international gaming and hospitality operator, Wynn Resorts, also entered the 2023 Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces, ranking 99th.</p>
