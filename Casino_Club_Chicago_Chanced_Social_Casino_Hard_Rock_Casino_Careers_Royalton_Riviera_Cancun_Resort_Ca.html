    <h1>Casino Club Chicago Chanced Social Casino Hard Rock Casino Careers Royalton Riviera Cancun Resort Ca</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about such problems with verification.</p>
<p>Our Payments Team Manager has sent you an email with all the details now.</p>
<p>"Hello Irene!</p>
<p>I'm Payments Team Manager Vivien and it seems like you're struggling with the verification of your account. Let me specify why we can not approve any of the documents you sent except for your passport and explain what we have been asking for so you would be able to finally withdraw the money.</p>
<p>All your deposits were made from the credit card **4250 and that is why we are asking you to upload 2 photos of your credit card with the front side (with numbers covered like this 1111 11XX XXXX 1111) and back (with CVC covered));</p>
<p>I'd also like to point out that a proof of address is a very important document for verification, and no documents that would show your address were uploaded.</p>
<p>A bank statement should have your name, bank account number, and a list of transactions visible. It can be a photo of a paper document, or a PDF file from your bank, it seems like you uploaded just a screenshot from your banking app, and that is why it is not approved as a bank statement as it is not a proper document we are asking for.</p>
<p>A proof of deposit that you sent to us does not seem to show the deposit made to our casino, we need to see transaction details to be sure, as your last deposit was on the 16th of December and what you have uploaded depicts transactions made on 17th of December.</p>
<p>I'll sum up the documents that you need to upload, so it would be easier to check for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a proof of deposit with the transaction to our casino visible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 photos of your credit card with the front side (with numbers covered like this 1111 11XX XXXX 1111) and back (with CVC covered));</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a proof of address that is not older than 90 days and is a government-issued document;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a bank statement with transactions, your name and account number visible."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Vivien</p>
<p>Payments Team Manager</p>
<p>Hope all this will be solved soon ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>BrunoCasino Team</p>
