    <h1>Gila River Casino Hard Rock Casino In Biloxi Map Of Casinos In Atlantic City Casino Brango 1000 Free</h1>

<p>Dear Helena,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. There are 2 options – to close the account or to self-exclude and here is the difference:</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost none impact - the player can reopen the account anytime, and the casino has no obligation to the player. It can take more days to process this request and the casino can try to persuade you to not close your account.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If the player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances. (After cooling off period and this cannot be done for players whos are addicted/with gambling problem). The player has to clearly express his gambling problem.</p>
<p>Could you please confirm you successfully passed the KYC verification?</p>
<p>Additionally, please, forward me any relevant communication between you and the casino to kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I will be waiting for your reply patiently.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
