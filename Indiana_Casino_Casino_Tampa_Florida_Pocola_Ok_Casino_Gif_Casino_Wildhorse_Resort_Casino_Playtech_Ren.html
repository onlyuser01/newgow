<p>Playtech has extended its working agreement with Paddy Power, Betfair, and Sky Casino and will continue supplying the brands with content.</p>
<p>Playtech Renews Contract With Flutter Entertainment Brands</p>
<p>Playtech, a gambling app development company, has announced a comprehensive five-year contract extension with Flutter Entertainment brands Paddy Power, Betfair, and Sky Casino.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Playtech will continue supplying content, including live casinos, to the three brands’ online gambling offerings in markets throughout Europe. The contract extension is yet another successful business agreement for Playtech. Just recently, the company completed a non-exclusive sports wagering deal with Novomatic.</p>
<p>Flutter UK and Ireland chief executive Conor Grant welcomed the contract renewal with Playtech. He said that the two companies have had a long and fruitful relationship. Grant went on to say that Flutter was looking forward to continuing to supply its clients with Playtech products, which he described as one of the world’s leading suppliers of high-quality gaming products.</p>
<p>Shimon Akad, Playtech’s chief executive officer, lauded the extension as well. Flutter is one of Playtech’s main strategic partners, according to him, so the new long-term partnership between the two brands was important for the group.</p>
<p>The renewal is a testament to Flutter and Playtech’s long-standing and strong relationship, Akad said. In conclusion, he noted that Playtech is looking forward to continuing its collaboration with Flutter in its core markets to support Paddy Power, Betfair, and Sky Casino over the next five years.</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment Is A Market Mainstay</p>
<p>Given the scale and power of Flutter and its brands, the contract extension is a major achievement for Playtech.</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment plc (formerly Paddy Power Betfair plc) is a mainstay holding company on the gambling and gaming market. In addition to Paddy Power, Betfair, and Sky Casino, the company operates multiple other brands, including BetEasy, FanDuel, PokerStars, and more. The group recently confirmed rumors that it is planning to list FanDuel Sportsbook on a US exchange.</p>
<p>Betfair is one of Flutter’s most widely known brands. It runs an extensive list of products, including an online sportsbook and an online casino. Betfair recently experienced a bout of turbulence as it decided to cut ties with Gordon Elliott as a brand ambassador. The decision was made swiftly after a shocking image of the trainer emerged on social media.</p>
<p>Paddy Power is a bookmaker based in Ireland that runs the country’s largest telephone betting service.</p>
<p>The brand’s wide range of iGaming products includes offers sports betting, online poker, online bingo, online casino, and online games. Paddy Power started 2021 off on a high note by becoming the new sponsor for ITV’s live racing coverage.</p>
