    <h1>Durango Casino Resort Casino Catalina Rivers Casino Restaurants Mgm Grand Casino Las Vegas Eva Green</h1>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>Based on the update received from the casino, we decided to reopen the complaint and update it accordingly. They reconsidered the situation and provided us with all the requested evidence recently.</p>
<p>Dear Autosophy,</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information and details, we are updating this complaint to 'unjustified' due to breaching the casino's Terms and Conditions - with the help of another casino account or accounts (multiple accounts used by 1 person or collusion), your disputed account was engaged in fraudulent activity. After a Live Casino Welcome Bonus activation, in February 2022, your account played the same game (Baccarat Classic) as another account for at least 2 consecutive days, while you gained an unfair advantage over the casino and bypassed its system and rules by playing this way, in order to reduce the risk of loss as much as possible, meet the wagering requirements of the bonus in question, and accumulate and withdraw the winnings, which means a serious breach of the casino's rules. There are industry-standard rules that forbid more than 1 account per player or collusion, as well as doing activity giving the players an unfair advantage. The casino acted correctly and in accordance with its terms and conditions, and we accept its decision.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority in accordance with the information provided in my previous post, if it has not been done yet.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, BK8 Casino Team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
