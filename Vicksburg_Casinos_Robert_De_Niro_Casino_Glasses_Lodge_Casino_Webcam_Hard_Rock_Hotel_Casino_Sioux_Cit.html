    <h1>Vicksburg Casinos Robert De Niro Casino Glasses Lodge Casino Webcam Hard Rock Hotel Casino Sioux Cit</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming is not the only supplier that has something to write home about in the US iGaming market of late, as NeoGames S.A’s subsidiary, Pariplay, has announced a new content alliance with Tipico US.</p>
<p>The partnership will see Pariplay deploy a number of its homebrewed games through Wizard Games, its own dedicated studio, and content by third parties through the addition of Fusion games from the dedicated iGaming aggregator offering.</p>
<p>The titles will all be introduced to players locally in New Jersey, with the Garden State just pulling another big supplier in the face of Relax Gaming which received a local vendor license from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. Pariplay’s content is not launching right away, however, and it will be introduced to Tipico’s local platform in the first quarter of the new year.</p>
<p>Tipico and Pariplay are no strangers to their businesses as they have already been collaborating successfully across European markets and are prepared to take on this fresh and exciting challenge. Tipico US CEO Adrian Vella was very happy to see his company move to expand in the Garden State once again with an improved content offer provided by one of the leading suppliers in the markets.</p>
<p>The sentiment was echoed in the words of NeoGames President and Head of iGaming, Tsachi Maimon, who was similarly excited to confirm Pariplay’s content launch with Tipico US in the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>"Following our successful collaboration in the European market, we can’t wait to bring our Wizard Games and Fusion offerings to even more players in North America, a key region for us," Maimon confirmed, highlighting once again the importance that suppliers put on the US market and its potential as a whole.</p>
<p>This is hardly the first time Pariplay has launched its content offer with a local operator in New Jersey. Earlier this year, Pariplay also launched in the Garden State with Hard Rock Bet, once again deploying products from its Wizard Games studio as well as Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Pariplay has also moved onto Pennsylvania through a content alliance with Rush Street Interactive, as the supplier has already been making strong waves in the local iGaming market in the United States. Both Hard Rock Bet and Tipico allow Pariplay to look firmly at other iGaming states and expand rapidly when the opportunity arises.</p>
