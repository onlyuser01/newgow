    <h1>Hotel Casinos Near Me Casinos New Mexico Buffalo Bill S Resort And Casino Online Real Money Casino U</h1>

<p>From the casino’s viewpoint it’s true that the player is from a country where the bonus isn’t available. So, the decision not to pay the player is in compliance with their T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p>However, at Casino Guru, we believe that creating a safe environment for players should be one of the priorities of great online casinos. A part of this safe environment is that restrictions should be implemented on the casino’s side, so players won’t have the chance to break it by accident. And it’s really not hard to implement a feature that won’t allow players from a restricted country to play or get the bonus. You can read more about our opinion on situations like this in our fair gambling codex: https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos .</p>
<p>The argumentation that some players from restricted countries that can’t cash out winnings from bonus play just want to play, even if they can’t win, is something we can’t fully accept. The reason for this is that even though it may be true for some of them, it can still mislead lots of other players. For players who just want to try a game without real money, there are plenty of possibilities to play free demo versions of the games. We believe that any time the player can’t cash out, it should be clear to them that they are playing for play money, not real money. Otherwise, it can create a suspicion that the casino is trying to mislead players on purpose, even if this isn’t the intention.</p>
<p>Therefore, we’ll close this complaint in favor of the player. However, this was a no deposit bonus, there was no possibility for the player to lose their own money and there is no direct profit for casino from this. We think that this isn’t nearly as bad as letting a player deposit and then refusing to pay out their winnings because of some unenforced restriction. Therefore, the casino will only get a small amount of black points for this case.</p>
