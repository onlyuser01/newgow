    <h1>Gibson Casino Craps Casino Snoqualmie Casino Legends Casino Events Diamond Reels Casino Beem Casino</h1>

<p>In view of the now countless complaints against this casino, I am sure that my complaint will cause all online casino players to be stunned, because now the Beem Casino (the business purpose is of course not a casino in reality, but rather a kind of snowball system, where you earn real money and spend book money on it).</p>
<p>But now to my case:</p>
<p>It sounds unbelievable, but it is actually true. The casino just stole €1580 real money from my casino account.</p>
<p>It was pretty much 1680€ on it (got several screenshots of account history/game history and games where you can see everything easily as well as excerpts from the Beem account itself) but when I logged in mid last week there was suddenly only 100 € on it. This €100 was my last real money deposit from over a month and a half ago.</p>
<p>I didn't even use bonuses here because I won with real money.</p>
<p>Of course I also wrote to the support, but there was only the answer: "We don't know about anything". Several more emails from me were not answered at all. Absolutely dishonest and scandalous. Yes, that's actually a serious crime.</p>
<p>It is also important to inform the game providers as Beem Casino wants to scam the €1600 I won on Pragmatic Play Slots and thus cheating not only me but also the providers. The payment service providers of this casino must also be informed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This is anything but a petty crime, this is a serious crime. The casino must be blacklisted immediately". Casino Guru must now definitely say:</p>
<p>0.0 out of 10.0. So really a straight zero, decimal point zero.</p>
<p>I would then prepare the extensive evidence files and then email them to you once I have received feedback from you on what you think about this incident and if you will help me.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Stefan K****</p>
