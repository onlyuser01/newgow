    <h1>Las Vegas Strip Hotels And Casinos Atlantic City New Jersey Casinos Treasure Chest Casino Indian Cas</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>It's already been 12 years of playing in online casinos, I think it's a long time and enough to be able to give a more concrete opinion of what the world of online gambling is like.</p>
<p>I'm not currently a live casino player but I've played too.</p>
<p>But my focus is slot machines.</p>
<p>All this time I had big winnings like for example 2500â‚¬ in a 0.40â‚¬ spin</p>
<p>As well as big losses of â‚¬400 in one night!</p>
<p>The big prizes were falling to the rhythm of the game that I presented in the casinos and I was changing casinos non-stop and I noticed that an online casino can only be evaluated by its service, deposit withdrawals and customer service.</p>
<p>Only that</p>
<p>The fact of luck or bad luck has nothing to do with the casino, understand that.</p>
<p>It's the game providers that control this</p>
<p>They were the ones who gave me the big prizes and not the casino itself</p>
<p>There may be negotiations between them to try to retain the player's loyalty to the casino, but in my opinion that's all.</p>
<p>The casino war is created between the licenses curacao and Malta</p>
<p>For in terms of gains and losses it will be the same.</p>
<p>This to me is a system where we can blame the 2 in case of defeats etc.</p>
<p>It's all the same just like the casinos.</p>
<p>These sites like guru casinos and askgamblers.com advertise casinos and know much better than me about all this and still offer protection to the player in case a casino tries to escape its responsibilities and injustices with the players.</p>
<p>But for me it lacks a lot of truth about the game on both sides.</p>
<p>I had a strange experience yesterday at a casino where I played for the first time</p>
<p>The strange thing was this:</p>
<p>In each casino where we play for the first time, the slots are opened for the first time with a standard bet of between â‚¬2 and â‚¬2.50 in the case of pragmatic play slots.</p>
<p>And to my astonishment, in the 4 slots that I opened for the first time in this casino, the bet that I had made the last time I played this slot in another casino already came automatically.</p>
<p>For example 0.40 .. 0.20.. 0.45</p>
<p>How is it possible???</p>
<p>The casino was unable to explain this ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>By this I mean</p>
<p>Be careful when playing in casinos over time the good prizes will become rare to get much.</p>
<p>Because it's all 1 system 1 network you will never outsmart the system once you crash</p>
<p>And there will be defeats upon defeats</p>
<p>Just small prizes to try to get dirt in your eyes ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Attention this is my opinion</p>
<p>my outburst</p>
