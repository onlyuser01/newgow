<p>Professor BigWin review</p>
<p>Professor BigWin transports players to a science lab where they’ll meet an eccentric professor.</p>
<p>Beakers and vials smoke and shimmer as Professor BigWin conducts his experiments. If all goes well, this lab might just produce some precious elements.</p>
<p>Players looking for a quirky, light-hearted atmosphere will particularly appreciate this slot.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Professor BigWin has a whimsical melody as well as dramatic flair. Players will feel as if an explosive experiment might take place at any moment.</p>
<p>This slot’s host, the titular Professor BigWin, is a friendly man in a lab coat with hair that brings to mind Albert Einstein. He holds colorful liquids in his hands with the casual air of a mad scientist.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see notepads, plasma globes, and jars of gold. Each item is animated in vivid hues that suggest this lab is far more playful than serious.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Professor BigWin creates a wacky world of science.</p>
<p>Big win in the Professor BigWin slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Professor BigWin is a five-reel, four-row slot. There are 40 win lines in total.</p>
<p>If players wish, they can buy directly into the Bonus for 100x their current bet.</p>
<p>The swift gameplay ensures this slot remains engaging.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Free Game symbol and Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Mystery Replacement feature prompts a selection of symbols to transform into matching symbols.</p>
<p>The Replicating Reels feature can be triggered when 2 Scatters appear on the reels, or at random after any spin that does not include 2 Scatters. Players are then awarded 1 Replicating Reels spin, and 2-5 reels will become Replicating Reels. Each position on the Replicating Reels is transformed into a selected symbol at the start of the round.</p>
<p>Bonus feature of the game</p>
<p>During the Replicating Reels feature, all reels that were not replicated will spin. Players are then awarded any available wins.</p>
<p>The Free Games feature is awarded when players land Free Games symbols stacked 4 symbols high on 2 or more reels. The feature begins with 7 free spins.</p>
<p>Every position that holds a triggering Free Games symbol will become a Replicating Reel at the start of the Free Games feature. Additional Replicating Reels may be added if players land Free Games symbols stacked 4 symbols high on another reel.</p>
<p>Throughout the Free Games feature, players can use the High Voltage Mode to increase their odds of triggering additional Free Games and Replicating Reels.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.52%, below our yardstick for an average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.40 up to a maximum of $/£/€120.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Professor BigWin slot machine</p>
<p>Professor BigWin offers medium volatility, making it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, medium volatility, science lab-themed slot.</p>
<p>Despite its whimsical theme, Professor BigWin offers an RTP that is too low to merit a strong recommendation. Meanwhile, the moderate volatility will appeal less to mathematically-minded players.</p>
<p>However, the unique array of bonuses is intriguing and some players may find it worthwhile to check them out.</p>
