<p>Golden Dragon Game review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Golden Dragon by GameArt is a pretty standard Chinese-themed slot. It uses the typical red and gold colours scheme, framing the reels with a dragon statue in gold leaf at either end and decorating the reels themselves with intricate masks and icons relating to dragons.</p>
<p>While the slot doesn’t do much different with its style, it does it to a very high quality and, if you are fond of this sort of theme, there are few better versions of it.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics of Gold Dragon are a little over detailed, but the slot makes that work. The feel of the reels is much less an ordered series of rows and reels and much more a New Year’s Day parade of gold and jade.</p>
<p>The animations add to this atmosphere, adding a firework-like sparkle to the proceedings.</p>
<p>The music is a well-composed bit of pseudo-classical Chinese music which does the job of setting the scene and is sufficiently subtle as to allow the player to have it on without it turning into a kind of water torture.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Golden Dragon is a five reel slot with four rows and fifty win lines.</p>
<p>It has a nice little gamble feature that allows the player to play double or nothing by betting on the colour of the next card off a deck containing infinite cards. There is also a free spin bonus to spice things up.</p>
<p>On the whole, the gameplay elements are fairly typical of modern slots.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. In Golden Dragon, the Wilds are stacked, leading to some big multiway wins at times.</p>
<p>The Scatter only appears on reels two, three and four. If the player lands a Scatter on all three reels in one spin, they pay out four times the bet per spin and trigger a Free Spin Bonus.</p>
<p>The Free Spin Bonus starts with five free spins. During the free spins, stacked Wilds are more frequent on the reels and the Scatter remains in play, paying out as usual and adding five more spins should the player hit another three in one go.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.00%, spot on our yardstick for average which we hold to be around 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€125.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low, which makes it a very poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our strategies tend to target highly volatile slots.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Golden Dragon is a good example of its kind. While it doesn’t do much that is new, what makes it stand out is the quality with which it does it.</p>
<p>The theme is a tired one, but in Golden Dragon it is given some new life by high-quality visuals. The gameplay is simple, but compelling. Even the RTP is exactly what we consider average.</p>
<p>The main downside from our point of view is the low volatility. However, if low volatility works for you, this slot might be a good choice.</p>
