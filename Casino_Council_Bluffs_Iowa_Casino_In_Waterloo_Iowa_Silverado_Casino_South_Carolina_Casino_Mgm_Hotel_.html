    <h1>Casino Council Bluffs Iowa Casino In Waterloo Iowa Silverado Casino South Carolina Casino Mgm Hotel</h1>

<p>The country’s biggest sports betting operator has agreed to incorporate the platform that belongs to the gaming company with the fastest growth in Central and Eastern Europe across all its online and brick-and-mortar channels. That’s not all that the new deal will bring to the table.</p>
<p>Superbet will generate a complete digital payment experience for its customers, with special emphasis on the OKTO.WALLET alternative for betting terminals with self-service which has also been embraced by the operator. The OKTO mobile app and the cashless payment platform will now become available in Superbet’s retail network, following their attempt to create a unified payment experience using multiple points of contact. The new partnership is important for the group’s digitalization strategy meant to bring more comfort, security, and safety via advanced cashless payment solutions.</p>
<p>1,000 Superbet Points of Sale and Counting</p>
<p>The new changes have been operated at all of the 1,000 Superbet points of sale in Romania. Future plans for expansion have electronic gaming machines at the center, in the context of the operator’s ongoing efforts to complete its fully-digitized strategy for simplified payments.</p>
<p>Superbet Group’s director for Romania retail and multichannel Ciprian Lazăr spoke about the group’s “global growth ambitions” while highlighting the need to keep up with their customers’ ongoing demands for the freshest technological advent. He called OKTO a “market-leading digital payment provider” that is expected to provide Superbet with “complementary solutions” to its strategy aimed at responsible gaming and legal compliance in all covered markets.</p>
<p>OKTO.CASH e-Vouchers for Online Sports Betting</p>
<p>Superbet will supply online bettors with OKTO.CASH e-vouchers. This will be possible by integrating the platform with alternative payment methods from Nuvei. The Canadian company offers future-proof technology that enables businesses to embrace state-of-the-art payment solutions.</p>
<p>Superbet customers will this way be able to top off their online accounts in a fast, safe, and efficient manner via the OKTO network which incorporates over 25,000 points of sale across Romania.</p>
<p>Superbet Group’s head of antifraud, payments &amp; risk payments Luca Giancola explained that Innovation was in the group’s DNA, which is why it is mandatory to use “solutions that are coming from people who understand the intricacies of the gaming industry” and who rely on “advanced technology” for delivering superior payment solutions.</p>
<p>Giancola added that the group’s strategy was perfectly aligned with OKTO’s strategy. He also spoke about the “shared commitment” to keep investing “in the delivery of the best possible experience” on all channels and at all levels.</p>
<p>OKTO’s chief commercial officer Simon Dorsen called the new partnership one that is “fully aligned with our mission not only to digitalize the physical payment experience” but also to offer customers the chance to seamlessly and safely complete transactions across multiple channels and touchpoints using a “unified payment experience”.</p>
<p>In September, Evoplay announced it would further expand in Romania by signing a partnership with Superbet. During the same month, Hacksaw Gaming sealed a content partnership agreement with Superbet, allowing the provider of top-level slots and scratchcards to introduce its portfolio to players in Romania.</p>
