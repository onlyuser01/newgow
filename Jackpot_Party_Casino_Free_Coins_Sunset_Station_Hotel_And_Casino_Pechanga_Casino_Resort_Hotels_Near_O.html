<p>Expansion across the US Continues</p>
<p>The announcement for the upcoming Live Casino in Michigan is the latest development around Playtech’s strategy seeking to establish the company as a leading gambling technology provider in every licensed US jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Playtech entered the country in New Jersey, when the gambling supplier rolled out its casino content via bet365 in August last year, following the approval for its services from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) in June.</p>
<p>By the end of September 2020, Playtech expanded its presence in the Garden State via an agreement with the sports betting and iGaming brand of MGM Resorts and Entain, BetMGM, to roll out its online casino software to BetMGM Casino, Borgata Online, and PartyCasino NJ.</p>
<p>In Michigan, Playtech entered into a strategic partnership with Parx Casino in February to provide it with multiple products via Playtech’s IMS Platform set to launch together with online casinos in the state.</p>
