<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>For anyone who has issues with Betflip withdrawals I wanted to see if we could make any progress together (I say this with little hope).</p>
<p>This is really intended as a thread outside of the ridiculous bonus turnaround criteria.</p>
<p>I have raised a complaint with casinoguru and have now seen 2 other UK users "Robert" and "Sonador5" who I would be interested to hear from.</p>
<p>In short here is the situation we all seem to be experiencing.</p>
<p>All bonus criteria complete with no issues or no bonus added.</p>
<p>All verification complete.</p>
<p>All withdrawals going into a pending state and then later rejected.</p>
<p>Live chat is being blocked by IP and not answered if logged in.</p>
<p>Live chat is answered if i) I do not log in, ii) I switch browsers, iii) I switch IP address... but then am simply ignored or they cancel chat.</p>
<p>No email replies.</p>
<p>In the last 3 weeks I have been told that "payments are down for maintenance" (deposits work though!), "short staffed due to Covid, if I make a withdrawal Friday it will be queued, to wait until end of the day, to wait another 10 days, that I am not allowed to switch IP or I will be sorry"... but mainly just "we have raised this as urgent and we will get back to you" - of course all BS!</p>
<p>Other then the casino guru complaint I am at a loss. My balance is now over 4,600 Euros, I seem to now also be blocked from all casino... is that the same for other users?</p>
<p>So yes, my mistake, lesson learnt, understand they don't have a license now, own fault, should have done more due diligence, etc... but now trying to see if anyway I can get anything out.</p>
<p>I see an old case where "Sofia Hagan head of customer support and fraud team" managed to sort an issue and I was told by one live chat agent that she "was not working today" which gave me hope she may be there (or most likely an alias).</p>
<p>Anyway, a lot of issues with this place but interested to see if any luck with those also struggling and if we can update and work together?</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>
