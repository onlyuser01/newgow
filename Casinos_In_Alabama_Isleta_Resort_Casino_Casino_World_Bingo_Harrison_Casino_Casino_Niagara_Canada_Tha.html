<p>Eight police officers were arrested but General Surachate was not among them</p>
<p>The Thai police have conducted a raid on the home of a major police officer over alleged ties to an illegal gambling network. Referred to as “Betflix,” in reference to the international streaming giant Netflix, the network operates in violation of Thailand’s laws on gambling.</p>
<p>In recent times, the Thai police have been doubling down on their efforts to crack down on the unlicensed gambling scheme. As a result, law enforcers recently raided around 30 locations across six provinces in Thailand.</p>
<p>The locations notably included the home of none other than deputy national police chief Surachate Hakparn. Found in central Bangkok, the officer’s home was raided by a Swat team that sought evidence of ties to Betflix.</p>
<p>A well-known personality thanks to regular media appearances, Surachate demonstrated a lack of concern amid the investigation. Denying any involvement in the gambling scheme, he said that he would answer any questions.</p>
<p>Surachate vowed to cooperate with the investigation and pointed out that he is not worried because he knows that he is innocent.</p>
<p>Several People Were Arrested</p>
<p>Betflix is an illegal offshore gambling website that targets Thai customers. Since most forms of gambling are illegal in the country, the site is a significant problem to the local ecosystem. Operating 12 subsidiary sites, Betflix isn’t the only illegal operator trying to illegally profit off the Thai market and is part of a concerning trend.</p>
<p>The raids in Thailand saw investigators issue some 23 arrest warrants. Eight of the arrested people were police officers, the police said. However, General Surachate was not among the arrestees.</p>
<p>In May, the Thai police swept a number of reported sites of unlawful activity and brought suspects to justice, arresting a total of 15 people.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Thailand continues to mull over the idea of launching integrated resorts. Earlier this year, reports suggested that the first such properties might launch by 2030. Multiple international gambling giants are interested in exploring opportunities in the region, including powerhouses such as MGM Resorts International, Galaxy Entertainment, Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment, Genting, Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands.</p>
