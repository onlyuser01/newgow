<p>Rumors swirled quickly on June 29, after Rod “Slasher” Breslau posted a Tweet, reporting an upcoming AAA project by Ubisoft called Hyper Scape. Codenamed “Prisma Dimensions,” news about the games spread quickly becoming a fact shortly after Ubisoft launched the game’s website last night.</p>
<p>What Is Hyper Scape AKA Prisma Dimensions?</p>
<p>Hyper Scape or Prisma Dimensions is an upcoming free-to-play battle royale game by Ubisoft. News about the game was first reported on June 29 by Rod “Slasher” Breslau who said in a tweet that Ubisoft was developing a “AAA multiplayer fast-paced FPS Battle Royale”.</p>

<p>Breslau said that he had it on a good authority that the game would be launching on July 12 and coincide with Ubisoft’s first digital conference going by the name of Ubisoft Forward. Shortly after the tweet, Ubisoft launched the official Prisma Dimensions website, inviting anyone interested to sign up for the open beta which will start on July 2.</p>
<p>When Will Hyper Scape Release?</p>
<p>Open Beta : July 2</p>
<p>: July 2 Launch Date: July 12 (PC), Consoles (Unknown)</p>
<p>The official dates set for the public beta and full-scale launch are July 2 and July 12 respectively, as reported by Breslau.</p>
<p>An Unprecedented Level of Twitch Integration</p>
<p>One of the key areas in which Ubisoft will focus on is integrating its product with Twitch. Breslau argued that the game would focus on “a full partnership with Twitch with never seen levels of integration from a big game before.”</p>
<p>Pushing for a broader footprint on Twitch suggests that Ubisoft is going to emulate the same strategy Apex Legends used at launch, retaining the services of streamers and popularizing the game overnight.</p>
<p>According to @Slasher, streamers will be able to earn revenue from bits purchase and viewers will have a direct impact on the gameplay by voting on GM cards.</p>
<p>Join the Prisma Dimensions Beta on July 2</p>
<p>With the official website now available, any interested party is invited to sign up for the first crack at the open beta on July 2. Dr. Ivy Tan, Ubisoft’s CEO, has described Hyper Scape’s in-game environment as a “global-hyper network.”</p>
<p>As the release date is fast approaching, further details about the will become available. The action is set in a virtual city called “Hyper Scape,” hence the name, and players will have a good choice of maps to pick from.</p>
<p>Free to Play Battle Royale, Cross-play and Battle Pass Inbound</p>
<p>Hyper Scape will be a free-to-play project, ambitiously entering into the battle royale segment. The game will support cross-play almost from the start and bring players from different platforms together to compete in the neon-lit futuristic world. Specifically, Prisma Dimensions will be available on:</p>
<p>PC</p>
<p>PlayStation 4</p>
<p>Xbox One</p>
<p>The game will most likely carry over to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X once these consoles become available. While Hyper Scape will release for PC on July 12, platforms will have to wait until later into 2020.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hyper Scape will most likely make use of a Battle Pass, allowing the game to monetize and perhaps contribute to a prize pool for future esports competitions. Similar games to have used the same monetization model include Apex Legends, Warzone, and Fortnite.</p>
<p>More information will become available as we get closer to release date.</p>
