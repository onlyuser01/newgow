<p>EveryMatrix has appointed former Croatian Lottery executive Nikolina Gabelica as their new head of lottery</p>
<p>The provider of premium iGaming software, solutions, content, and services to worldwide Tier 1 operators and new brands, EveryMatrix, has attracted fresh talent to its top team in the person of former Croatian Lottery executive, Nikolina Gabelica.</p>
<p>Gabelica has been appointed the new head of lottery role. Her main responsibilities will cover leading the product and commercial strategy of the company for businesses belonging to the World Lottery Association and the European Lottery Association worldwide.</p>
<p>At the same time, the new head of lottery will need to focus on harnessing EveryMatrix’s “success in working with large-scale organizations such as the Hungarian National Lottery (SZRT) and Veikkaus,” according to the company’s statement.</p>
<p>Gabelica, “Hugely Respected in the Lottery World”</p>
<p>As commented by the Group’s chief executive officer, Ebbe Groes, Gabelica is “hugely respected in the lottery world with vast experience in the retail and digital requirements lotteries have today.”</p>
<p>Groes further acknowledged the constant need for adaptation to new tech shown by these businesses, along with the necessity to serve a new generation of customers searching for instant entertainment options across classic and online or mobile lotto products.</p>
<p>In this regard, EveryMatrix is already collaborating with some highly progressive members of the World Lottery Association who have successfully proven their ability to deliver game-changing technologies helping these businesses reach new heights.</p>
<p>The CEO wished “Niki” a warm welcome to the team while expressing plans to further extend their reach in the lottery space.</p>
<p>The New Head of Lottery, “Grateful” to Join EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Gabelica, who describes herself as a “seasoned and dedicated leader with over two decades of experience in the gaming industry,” has also commented on her new appointment.</p>
<p>Hrvatska Lutrija’s former director of the business development &amp; marketing division and deputy director for the lottery games, online &amp; betting division among others for almost 14 years prior has expressed gratefulness for the “warm welcome extended by the fantastic team” at EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>She spoke about her rich expertise in the lottery and gaming fields, expressing her view that her experience would give her a “diverse perspective” that she plans to use to develop strategies for current and upcoming member organizations of the World Lottery Organization as well as their clients.</p>
<p>Gabelica also described EveryMatrix’s modular, application programming interface-driven solutions as “ideal” for international lotteries searching for ways to launch or extend their digital foothold.</p>
<p>The former executive chair of the working group for marketing &amp; communications for The European Lotteries said she was looking forward to meeting customers during the ICE 2024 between February 6-8 at ExCeL London.</p>
<p>Last November, EveryMatrix published its Q3 results that reaffirmed its growth trajectory. The month before that, the company announced it would leverage SlotMatrix to inject content into BetPARX.</p>
