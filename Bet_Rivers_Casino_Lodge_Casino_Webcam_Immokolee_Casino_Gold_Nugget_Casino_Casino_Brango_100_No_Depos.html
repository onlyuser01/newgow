<p>After entering Colorado last year, MaximBet announced on Thursday that it plans to continue its US expansion by launching its services in Iowa and Indiana.</p>
<p>MaximBet Continues US Expansion</p>
<p>MaximBet, the lifestyle sports betting and online casino brand operated by Carousel Group in collaboration with Maxim, announced that it plans to continue its US expansion. The innovative brand revealed that the next two states where it plans to launch its services are Indiana and Iowa.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional sportsbooks, MaximBet rewards players with real-world money-can’t-buy experiences. Moreover, the brand is well-known for offering the best-in-class customer service. Complementing its ongoing growth, MaximBet inked a multi-year deal with Kambi, the leading global sports betting provider. Additionally, the brand has a deal in place with leading iGaming platform provider White Hat Gaming.</p>
<p>The Brand Offers Unique Experiences for Sports Fans</p>
<p>The first US state where MaximBet debuted was Colorado. The brand entered the market last year and quickly became one of the most popular operators in Colorado. Besides its upcoming launch in Iowa and Indiana, MaximBet announced that it plans to grow further, entering other US states and expanding to Canada later this year.</p>
<p>Additionally, back in December, MaximBet launched MaximBet Play, its first free-to-play platform. The platform was developed in collaboration with free-to-play provider Splash Tech. The free-to-play platform MaximBet Play enabled sports fans around the US to access unique gaming experiences and win prizes.</p>
<p>Sports Fans in Iowa, Indiana Are in for a Treat</p>
<p>Besides launching MaximBet Play, MaximBet launched its division that specializes in parties and events dubbed MaximBet LIVE in Colorado last year. MaximBet LIVE will soon reveal plans for kick-off parties in Iowa and Indiana as well. As with any state or jurisdiction where MaximBet operates, the brand remains committed to responsible gambling. Moreover, the brand is focused on helping consumers enjoy playing responsibly.</p>
<p>“Indiana and Iowa represent a prime opportunity for MaximBet to bring its world-class sportsbook and unparalleled real-life experiences to two of the most passionate sports markets in the country.” Daniel Graetzer, CEO at MaximBet</p>
<p>MaximBet’s CEO, Daniel Graetzer, outlined in a statement that Iowa and Indiana represent a prime opportunity for the brand. He acknowledged that the two states have some of the most passionate sports markets. Graetzer outlined that the popularity of sports betting in both Iowa and Indiana has been growing, but sports fans are yet to enjoy MaximBet’s unique experiences. In conclusion, he said that the brand is looking forward to “show our new users in Indiana and Iowa what we have in store.”</p>
