<p>World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen Joins Kindred Group’s Chess Team</p>
<p>Kindred Group announced that it is sending a team to the first of its kind FIDE Online World Corporate Chess Championship. The company’s team consists of three employees and Magnus Carlsen, a chess grandmaster and Unibet ambassador.</p>
<p>The initial FIDE Online World Corporate Chess Championship gathers a total of 288 teams. The inaugural event brings 1,467 players that represent 78 countries around the globe. Joining the team of three, Carlsen forms Team Kindred which will participate in the tournament starting today. Furthermore, Carlsen has a signed two-year global sponsorship agreement with Unibet from 2020.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to strengthen our team with our Unibet ambassador Magnus Carlsen.” Jasper Tambini, analyst marketing intelligence at Kindred Group</p>
<p>Jasper Tambini, analyst marketing intelligence at Kindred Group and captain of Team Kindred, said that he is very excited that Carlsen will strengthen the company’s team. Furthermore, he acknowledged that the popularity of betting on chess is increasing, especially when Unibet’s ambassador is near the chessboard. In conclusion, Tambini said that the “playful approach to precise execution” that the game brings can easily relate to the company’s daily work.</p>
<p>Carlsen Is Excited to Participate in the Tournament</p>
<p>In a statement, Carlsen said that the tournament will be a fun break from his daily tournaments. He added that he looks forward to representing Kindred in the games that feature teams by some of the biggest companies in the world. Furthermore, Carlsen acknowledged that many teams are competing and some of them have shown high competence. He added that he is impressed by the enthusiasm showed by both Kindred and Unibet when it comes to chess.</p>
<p>Both Unibet and Kindred have shown a commitment to chess previously. Unibet was the first international gambling operator to introduce live odds on chess back in 2014. Back then, Carlsen was defending his World Champion title and won. Furthermore, the same year, Unibet was a primary sponsor for the “No Logo Norway Chess“. The company was also an official betting partner for FIDE in 2018 during the World Championship match between Fabiano Caruana and Carlsen.</p>
