    <h1>Agua Caliente Casino Beau Rivage Resort Casino Sands Casino Resort Casino Demo Bally S Casino Atlant</h1>

<p>I was sent an email with a promise of free 100 spins.</p>
<p>I won some money and started playing other slots throughout the next couple of days, slowly building my bankroll from 10 through their mandatory play which is about 500-700 USD before you can withdraw. I did that then I submitted my paperwork asking to withdraw.</p>
<p>They approved my paperwork, then they denied my approval amount, and cut my money without so much as a notice.</p>
<p>They stole my money.</p>
<p>I want to get an attorney and sue them. They owe me 449.11. I won it fair and square.</p>
<p>Please help me get my money back.</p>
