    <h1>Robert Deniro Casino Sweepstakes Casino Seneca Niagara Casino Anacortes Casino Palace Station Hotel</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming will now provide a range of experiences for Softgenius, strengthening the operator’s library with outstanding games that are a mix of the company’s very own development arm as well as third parties that have been delivering hard-hitting and top-performing content.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Continues to Support Operators Worldwide</p>
<p>Softgenius seeks to provide next-generation content and experiences for its players and this tie-up with Relax Gaming is just the right way to achieve that. The two teams will work hard to ensure that Softgenius gets the most out of this opportunity, deploying not just raw content but also technology and innovative solutions to further boost its industry standing.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has plenty to offer, including directly from its own dedicated library with games such as Money Train Origins Dream Drop and more. The latest installment in the Money Train series was launched earlier this month and it features one of Relax’s most innovative game solutions to date – the Dream Drop mechanic. Commenting on this opportunity Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard said that she was pleased to now have the opportunity and see Relax power the Softgenius offer.</p>
<p>We thoroughly enjoy partnering with unique, forward-thinking operators and Softgenius is making great strides in the industry and we look forward to seeing its continued growth,” Attard noted.</p>
<p>Softgenius CEO Lorand R. Minyo has had a similarly positive response to the partnership and said that the integration marked a significant milestone for his company as well. He said that Relax Gaming is one of the best-known names in the industry and with the supplier and aggregator’s help, the operator would be able to “reach new heights.”</p>
<p>Building a Strong Portfolio of Proprietary and Third-Party Games</p>
<p>R. Minyo further confirmed that his company and team were confident in the success of the partnership and its ongoing benefits for Softgenius’ audiences and player bases. Apart from teaming up with operators, Relax Gaming has been working to actively increase and strengthen its position by teaming up with various studios.</p>
<p>Recently, the company established a similar partnership with Trigger Studios, adding the company to the aggregation platform. The company also introduced the Money Cart 3 slot in April, continuing to capitalize on many of its strong slot franchises.</p>
