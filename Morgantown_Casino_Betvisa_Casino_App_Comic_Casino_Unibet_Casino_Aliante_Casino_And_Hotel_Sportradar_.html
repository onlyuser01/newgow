<p>In May 2019, global leader in sports technology Sportradar and sports data and technology company and provider of video streaming, data management, and integrity services Genius Sports entered a legal argument. Now, the three-year-old dispute has finally come to an end.</p>
<p>What Started the Legal Dispute?</p>
<p>The legal argument started when Genius Sports and a British company representing the data rights of professional football leagues in England and Scotland Football DataCo (FDC) signed a partnership. The said partnership granted Genius Sports the exclusive rights to license and offer live data from big leagues like the Football League, Premier League, and the Scottish Professional Football League.</p>
<p>According to Sportradar, this prevented it from building its own database with soccer football statistics. At the same time, the licensing agreement between Genius Sports and FDC stopped it from freely competing in the market. Sportradar also claimed that the deal prevented it from accessing official data from the FDC, in spite of its expressed willingness to pay in exchange for the said data.</p>
<p>What Will Happen Now?</p>
<p>According to an official statement issued by Genius Sports following the settlement of the litigation, FDC will keep licensing and marketing FDC data in the future. At the same time, Genius Sports will keep the exclusive right to offer low-latency official FDC betting data rights throughout 2024.</p>
<p>In exchange, Sportradar has agreed to refrain from unofficial in-stadia scouting during Football League, Premier League, and Scottish Professional Football League matches. Sportradar has also obtained a Genius Sports sublicense, having a delayed feed be marketed as the Official FDC Secondary Feed in the upcoming two years. The rest of the terms of the legal settlement have remained undisclosed.</p>
<p>360-degree one-stop-shop provider for betting and gaming operators Sportradar is also busy protecting sports against doping, match-fixing, and other similar integrity threats. The company is also known to help leagues, sports federations, and big competitions become better at collecting data straight from their venues and using it to generate live events, enhance fan and sponsor engagement rates, and ultimately obtain more from their own content and data.</p>
<p>On October 10, Sportradar announced a new partnership with Pragmatic Solutions. The new agreement will integrate Sportradar’s Managed Trading Services and Orako sportsbook with Pragmatic Solutions’ player account management platform. In mid-September, Genius Sports hit the Canadian market with the help of a NorthStar Gaming launch. As part of the deal, Genius Sports will use its data to power NorthStar Gaming’s NorthStar Bets on the Canadian market, helping it strengthen its foothold in regulated markets.</p>
<p>Just now, Sportradar announced a new agreement with XLMedia.</p>
