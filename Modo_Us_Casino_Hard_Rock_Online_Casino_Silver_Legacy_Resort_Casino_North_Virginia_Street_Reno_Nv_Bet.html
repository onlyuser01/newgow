<p>Inter Miami vs DC United is one of the most exciting matchups of this weekend’s MLS round</p>
<p>Inter Miami’s coach Phil Neville and DC United’s boss Wayne Rooney used to be teammates in Man United in the early 2000s. Now, they’re coaching rival teams in the MLS, and Rooney’s boys are doing much better. Still, oddsmakers do think Neville’s team might grab a win on June 3.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs DC United Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Inter Miami +129 Draw +260 DC United +179</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 2.5 -133 Under 2.5 +104</p>

<p>“The Herons” Need to Step Out of Horrible Form</p>
<p>The team owned by David Beckham has huge ambitions, but the reality is different – Inter Miami is sitting at the very bottom of the MLS Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>After 15 rounds, “The Herons” are 5-0-10 with a score difference of 14-19. Even though their defense hasn’t been too bad, their offense just can’t get on target. At least not enough to matter. That’s kind of surprising given that Inter Miami’s roster is packed with talented attackers.</p>
<p>Josef Martinez, for example, was the most valuable striker in the MLS a few years ago, while he was wearing the Atlanta United jersey. However, since moving to Florida, he’s scored just three MLS goals for Inter Miami.</p>
<p>Then there’s the former France U21 international Corentin Jean who’s scored just one goal since joining this team in 2022. Leonardo Campana, Miami’s No. 9, has been doing okay, scoring three goals in nine MLS games. Still, the 22-year-old Colombian also needs to up his game.</p>
<p>DC United Players Want to Stay Undefeated in Miami</p>
<p>DC United leads the all-time series with Inter Miami in the MLS with three wins, one draw, and one loss. What’s interesting is that the boys from the nation’s capital are without a single defeat on their trips to Florida.</p>
<p>However, they need to feel concerned ahead of Saturday’s game because their recent away form isn’t very good. In fact, Rooney’s men are without a win on the road since April. Still, there’s an explanation for that – they played against some really tough teams in that period.</p>
<p>Their last two losses on the road happened to FC Cincinnati and Toronto FC. In between those two games, they also drew with Philadelphia Union in Philly.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs DC United Prediction</p>
<p>DC United has better players than Inter Miami, and we also believe Wayne Rooney is a better coach than Phil Neville. That’s why we’re almost certain the visitors will not lose on Saturday. But can they beat Inter Miami in Florida? We’re not so sure about that. Instead, a tie looks like the most probable outcome.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami and DC United to draw</p>
