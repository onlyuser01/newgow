    <h1>Lucky Charms Sweepstakes Casino Carson City Casinos Best Vegas Casino Wind Creek Casino App Free Pla</h1>

<p>Dear rachelbedford80,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"...The maximum bet amount allowed when wagering a bonus is 2 EUR.... Betting more than 2 EUR at once while having an active bonus may be considered misuse of the bonus offers and can result in the confiscation of all winnings received in such a way. ..."</p>
<p>Our position is closely explained in Fair Gambling Codex:</p>
<p>The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>I understand your frustration, however, if you breached this rule by placing such bets repeatedly, intentionally or not, there is not much we could do. As long as the rule is stated on the website the casino confiscated your winnings in compliance with their bonus T&amp;Cs. I can only recommend that you always check the full bonus terms prior to activating any bonus.</p>
<p>Please, do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything else I could help you with.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
