<p>The company announced immediate and upcoming senior leadership changes applicable for its properties in Atlantic City and Las Vegas</p>
<p>The leading gaming, hospitality and entertainment company, MGM Resorts International, has announced multiple changes to its senior leadership team. The company confirmed that some of the appointments are with immediate effect while others are expected throughout 2024.</p>
<p>Corey Sanders, MGM’s chief operating officer, confirmed that Rick Limardo was promoted to the role of SVP of government affairs. This appointment, the chief operating officer said, is with immediate effect. Limardo first joined the company back in 2018.</p>
<p>Throughout his extensive career, he spent nearly two decades as a part of private companies and the government sector. Undoubtedly, Limardo’s experience will help him in his new role where he will be responsible for MGM’s expansion and affairs with local, state and federal authorities.</p>
<p>Sanders confirmed another immediate appointment. He revealed that Ayesha Molino was selected for the role of COO and president of ARIA and Vdara, two of MGM’s properties on the Las Vegas Strip. While the appointment is with immediate effect, Sanders confirmed that Molino will continue to hold her role as a member of the company’s executive committee and chief of public affairs.</p>
<p>At the start of 2017, Molino first joined MGM. With the recent appointment, she fills a role that was left vacant by Anton Nikodemus, an executive with nearly two decades of experience who served as the COO and president of the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas as well as ARIA. Sanders did not disclose details regarding Nikodemus’ future plans.</p>
