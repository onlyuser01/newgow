<p>Fortune Tiger review</p>
<p>Fortune Tiger transports players to a Chinese realm where tigers rule.</p>
<p>Surrounded by luxurious shades of gold and red, players will meet enchanted creatures including frogs, fish, and, of course, tigers. With the help of these animals, they might discover a golden coin or two.</p>
<p>Big win in the Fortune Tiger slot machine</p>
<p>Fans of Chinese cultural imagery will particularly enjoy this slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Traditional red lanterns adorn each side of the reels with a pot of golden coins balanced at the top. Sharp-eyed players will notice two golden tiger figurines above the reels as well.</p>
<p>Among the symbols, there are phoenixes, fish and frogs. Each animal can appear in gold, or in regular hues. The tiger is the most striking animal, animated in a realistic style in shades of green, blue, purple, and golden orange. The realistic style of the tiger ensures that this majestic predator is an intimidating presence.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will glimpse the silhouettes of trees and bridges. Glowing fireworks appear in the sky, adding to the festive feel of this slot.</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Fortune Tiger has a theatrical vibe with lingering string notes and a classical Chinese influence. The reels spin with a beep and clicking sound, and occasionally a gong for emphasis.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Fortune Tiger create a compelling world of animals and East Asian imagery.</p>
<p>Bonus round awards 10 free spins</p>
