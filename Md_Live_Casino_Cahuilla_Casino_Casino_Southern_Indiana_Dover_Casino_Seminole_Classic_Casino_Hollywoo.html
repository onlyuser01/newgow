    <h1>Md Live Casino Cahuilla Casino Casino Southern Indiana Dover Casino Seminole Classic Casino Hollywoo</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>in advance to my place of residence. This is Puerto Rico. I can't change it, but I live in Germany.</p>
<p>In my case: I've been registered at this casino for a long time and asked before making a deposit whether any documents were required for verification. I then got an email from the KYC that no documents are needed because I am verified. So play and win. When paying out, I got an email that documents were suddenly needed. All required documents have been sent to. Two days later I got an email to send a selfie along with my passport. Since then, I've only ever gotten the answer in live chat that my documents are being checked and my payment is being processed. Due to the many bad reviews, which I unfortunately only saw afterwards, I turn to you. Can you help me with that? As information, I can tell you that, as already mentioned, I was already verified, played without a bonus and paid attention to the turnover conditions for the respective deposits.</p>
