<p>At the beginning of April, gaming aggregator and content provider Relax Gaming announced a PokerStars partnership that would pave its way onto the Italian market for the first time ever. Today, the supplier launched an open invitation to players to try out its brand new slot release called Midnight Marauder. The game was added to an already rich library with 3,000+ proprietary games as well as games from third-party developers through partnership programs.</p>
<p>The most popular bank robber on the planet is eager to take off with a bag full of riches at midnight, and you could help him do it and split the loot.</p>

<p>Game Design and Feel</p>
<p>The game is designed in a way to create the illusion of a burglar getting ready to go about looking for his loot at a bank at midnight. As a player, you will feel an inexplicable urge to join the dastardly bank robber in his attempt to grab some gems while focused on landing the right symbols and triggering the innovative Collect &amp; Multiply feature. This feature has not been used by any other supplier before and it allows players to win up to 30,000x the original bet.</p>
<p>The game uses a classic 6×6 grid that requires players to form clusters of symbols that match in order to form a win. The grid displays regular symbols and design elements you would normally find in a robbery-themed game, while the outside of the grid introduces players to a building where the sneaky, comic, and cartoonish burglar chooses to tiptoe during gameplay. In spite of the actual theme, the game manages to create a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<p>The company’s chief product officer Simon Hammon described the game as a slot that is “truly worth celebrating” thanks to the one-of-a-kind game mechanic it comes with, referring to the Collect and Multiply feature. Hammon also added that he had “high hopes” for the success of the “fantastic game.”</p>
<p>Collect &amp; Multiply Feature</p>
<p>As mentioned before, once triggered, the Collect &amp; Multiply feature could bring players up to 30,000x the bet. The actual win will be collected into a symbol position and the game will also award re-spins. Provided the player manages to land several money bag symbols that belong to the same group during a re-spin session, the symbols may be multiplied against one another and trigger some mouth-watering wins.</p>
<p>To form a winning cluster, players need to land a minimum of five matching symbols in nearby positions, either on the horizontal or on the vertical. Regular paying symbols are represented by gems of different colors and shapes, with individual values ranging from 0.1x to 2x the stake. To learn the payout, the player must multiply the number of symbols in the winning cluster by the value of the individual symbols.</p>
<p>The game does not feature any wild symbols. However, it uses scatter symbols. When at least three scatters land during the base game, they will send the player straight into the free spins bonus round. The round begins with eight free spins. Extra bonus symbols that will land during this round will trigger more spins.</p>
<p>Players are also given the alternative to skip the base game and jump straight into the free spins round with the help of the buy feature that costs 100x the bet.</p>
<p>At the end of March, Relax Gaming released Hex, a high-volatility slot game centered around the voodoo theme. In mid-may, the aggregator announced a new partnership with Stakelogic Live.</p>
