<p>In a big boost to its burgeoning online sportsbook and casino offering, FSB, the innovative platform provider, has collaborated with Captain Up, an award-winning cloud-based gamification and loyalty platform.</p>
<p>FSB Partners with Captain Up</p>
<p>With the use of gamification, behavioral science, and smart social technologies, operators using FSB’s award-winning full tech-stack sportsbook and casino solution would be able to maximize consumer engagement and drive loyalty.</p>
<p>This involves creating and launching planned and tailored segmented projects, matching incentives, and benefits in different categories and platforms.</p>
<p>Head of Product at FSB, Shaan Balani, said: “It’s been a busy start to 2021 at FSB with new partners and new product integrations and we’re delighted this momentum continues on the back of our new agreement with Captain Up.”</p>
<p>Balani further stated that Captain Up enables FSB partners to run highly tailored promotions to various player groups, ensuring that the incentives they earn are perfectly matched with their playing preferences and trends.</p>
<p>This agreement is just one more example of how the organization is continually evolving the FSB platform to ensure that FSB partners have the technologies and tools they need to provide superior player experiences.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer at Captain Up, Uri Admon commented by saying that with features like Progressive Jackpots, Social Tournaments Avators, and Smart Promotions, Captain Up aims to push the limits of iGaming creativity.</p>
<p>Captain Up is committed to increasing interaction by offering personalized, gamified tools, analyzing numerous data points, providing meaningful input, supporting various KPIs, and adhering to the ever-changing regulatory guidelines in markets around the world.</p>
<p>The company is thrilled to be able to sell its goods to operators via FSB.</p>
<p>FSB Expands Presence in European Markets</p>
<p>This news comes only three weeks after FSB partnered with Incentive Games to provide its operator partners with a variety of free and pay-to-play games that work especially well in new and emerging markets.</p>
<p>Free-to-Play games from Incentive Games have proved to be very effective at lowering purchase costs, and retention products have been shown to increase players’ weekly visits, thus increasing lifetime value. These factors all work together to help operators boost their operating income.</p>
<p>Incentive Games and its portfolio of free-to-play and pay-to-play games impressed FSB Technology’s COO, Glenn Elliott, and he believes they would appeal to the company’s operator partners in key global markets.</p>
<p>They also add value to the FSB platform, allowing the company to provide a wider range of high-quality, well-tested content to operators.</p>
<p>In addition, the supplier has recently signed major platform deals with European operators, including German iGaming company OGaming, and has been expanding its presence in the rapidly growing US market through a strategic alliance with USBookmaking.</p>
