<p>Kenneth Strauss, a WSOP contender in 2019, was sentenced to two years of probation. The poker player misbehaved at a few venues in Las Vegas last summer.</p>
<p>A Court Deal Kept the Naked Player Kenneth Strauss Out of Jail</p>
<p>Kenneth Strauss, now 46 years old, was just another contender at WSOP in 2019. This was before he was disqualified from the tournament for exposing himself which combined with other obscure acts led to his arrest. According to Las Vegas Review-Journal, earlier this week, Strauss pleaded guilty on two charges for gross misdemeanor. Those charges are:</p>
<p>Making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, lethal agents or toxins prohibited</p>
<p>Malicious destruction of property</p>
<p>However, after striking a deal with the court, Strauss will not remain behind bars but will rather go through mental health treatment and two years of probation. Aside from the probation, Strauss is also banned from Clark County. Also he must not engage in any contact with casinos in Las Vegas for the two-year probation period.</p>
<p>In a video conference, with District Judge Mary Kay Holthus, Strauss who is no longer in custody said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just very sorry for what happened. And I‚Äôm just going to continue focusing on my mental health improving.‚Äú</p>
<p>How Did It All Happen?</p>
<p>Mr Strauss‚Äôs story began last year on July 5. He was participating in first day of the 2019 WSOP main event at the Rio, Las Vegas. He was competing among thousands of poker players in the $10K buy-in finale. All of a sudden, Strauss‚Äôs behavior changed and he began to act erratic. He went all-in and started shouting. Strauss then removed clothes and exposed himself to the public. He even took off his shoes and socks and threw one of the shoes on the poker table. It was at this moment that he was disqualified from the WSOP tournament and the security guards escorted him out of the property.</p>
<p>Uhhhhhh what is going on at the #WSOP main event??? Player shoves blind, drops his pants, then throws his shoe on the table üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ(video via @blattsmullet) pic.twitter.com/oHGk5pjlnJ ‚Äî Scott Davies (@sdaviespoker) July 5, 2019</p>
<p>However, his erratic behavior Strauss did not end at the Rio. A video emerged on Twitter from the same evening, where Strauss is seen on top of a craps table at the Luxor. On top of the table, Strauss was shouting and trying to get the attention of people around him. For a brief moment he undressed again and this led to the security guards taking him down from the table.</p>
<p>Following the two occurrences, Strauss allegedly shared some disturbing messages on Twitter. One such message reads: ‚ÄúShootings are taking place all over Las Vegas. Please leave me alone @VenetianVegas I have no place to go currently. And all Casinos that have me banned will be destroyed effective immediately. And @Rio, get my belongings together immediately when @POTUS declares safe I‚Äôm going.‚Äù This ultimately led to his arrest on July 27, 2019. Looking back in October, 2019, the court found Strauss as incompetent to stand trial and he was ordered to go through psychiatric tests.</p>
