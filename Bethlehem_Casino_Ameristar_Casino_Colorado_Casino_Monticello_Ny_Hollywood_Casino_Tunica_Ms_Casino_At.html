<p>PointsBet has become the first company to launch an in-play game parlay option for the NFL and NBA.</p>
<p>PointsBet Deepens In-Play Markets Expertise</p>
<p>The company has deployed its powerful OddsFactory technology platform to achieve this, which will now allow sports fans to benefit from the “Live Same Game Parlay” feature, which includes tracking odds, team stats, and player performance for a comprehensive experience. Commenting on this new milestone for the company, PointsBet Group COO Mark Hughes had this to add:</p>
<p>“At PointsBet, we’re focused on refining our technology to ensure we’re aligning with the type of online sports betting experience our customers seek and based on the trends we’re tracking, sports fans and bettors not only want to bet live, but they also want the ability to build the same game parlay live.” PointsBet Group COO Mark Hughes</p>
<p>This is going to significantly enhance the experience for consumers and allow them to benefit from betting opportunities that were previously unavailable to sports fans in the United States and beyond. This is the second major technological milestone for the company in so many days.</p>
<p>Last week, PointsBet became the first operator to achieve zero suspension on live markets during a test run at the NFL Wildcard Playoff. PointsBet is effectively the first to achieve this important milestone and deliver a new level of live experience for players.</p>
<p>The feature effectively allows players to browse through the “Same Game parlay” tab and choose multiple selections as they watch the events live. There will also be the opportunity to use the Parlay Booster on these selections, adding an additional incentive.</p>
<p>Exciting Times Ahead for the Company</p>
<p>As an authorized partner for the NFL and the NBA, PointsBet is set to deliver impeccable data and actionable information. The company is also the official sports betting partner of NBC Sports, which gives it another leg-up in the sports betting landscape. Talking about this achievement and the importance of the live betting market, PointsBet USA CMO Kyle Christensen said:</p>
<p>“Elevating the betting experience for our customers and tapping into innovation is part of PointsBet’s core mission. With the addition of our exclusive, live betting feature, we now have another way to help sports fans and bettors embody the Live Your Bet Life mantra.” PointsBet USA CMO Kyle Christensen</p>
<p>PointsBet has rapidly shaped itself as a market leader in in-play markets in the United States. The company is bringing its features online ahead of the March Madness and the Super Bowl season, standing to benefit from its technological edge in the coming weeks and well ahead in the year.</p>
