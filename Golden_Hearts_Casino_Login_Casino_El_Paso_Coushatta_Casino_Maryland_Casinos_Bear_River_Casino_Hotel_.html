<p>However, please note we notify the players about rules in TrustDice Casino which we consider unfair. Therefore the final rating is lower than it could be. The details can be found here , in our review. This complaint will be closed as resolved only based on the player's confirmation above.</p>
<p>We have rules, too. The casino has the right to use its rules, but it does not mean the rules can be used and applied against the players in any way. Especially in cases when it is considered unfair from our side or it does not make any sense.</p>
<p>I cannot find the information that the player is pleased with the outcome in this thread.</p>
