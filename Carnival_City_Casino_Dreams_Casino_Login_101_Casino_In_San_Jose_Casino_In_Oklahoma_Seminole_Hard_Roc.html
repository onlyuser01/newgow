    <h1>Carnival City Casino Dreams Casino Login 101 Casino In San Jose Casino In Oklahoma Seminole Hard Roc</h1>

<p>Sports betting technology supplier Elys Game Technology announced it has been granted approval by the DC Department of Small &amp; Local Business Development (DSLBD) of its certified business enterprise joint venture BetDupont in partnership with District Hospitality.</p>
<p>Two-Step Process</p>
<p>The approval obtained by Elys Game Technology paves the way for the company to operate in partnership with District Hospitality a sportsbook location at the Ozio Lounge in Washington, DC, subject to regulatory approval from the DC Office of Lottery and Gaming (DCOLG).</p>
<p>Michael Ciavarella, executive chairman of the Toronto-based technology firm, outlined that “this approval is the first in a two-step process” before the company can begin sportsbook operations at Ozio Lounge, the company believes that the approval is the latest display of its expansion momentum in the US, highlighting its ability to “operate sportsbooks as an ancillary product for restaurants, bars and other small business establishments in a fully compliant manner.”</p>
<p>Elys and District Hospitality announced an agreement in June this year under which the technology supplier would operate the BetDupont sportsbook located at 1813 M St. NW in Washington, DC. The agreement is for three years initially from the date of license issuance and has a minimum of two extensions of two years each.</p>
<p>Third Sportsbook Location in DC</p>
<p>Convinced that the launch of the sportsbook at the Ozio Lounge will facilitate the positioning of the establishment as a “premier destination for both local guests and tourists alike,” Ciavarella expressed his gratitude to DSLBD for its support, a display of its “commitment to helping both small businesses and the local DC economy.”</p>
<p>“Our sportsbook solution is not only garnering attention within DC, but we believe that interest is growing rapidly in this sector across the nation,” Ciavarella continued, looking forward to “announcing additional retail locations soon, as well as becoming operational into additional markets, including Ohio following the recent agreement with Wright Bet.</p>
<p>Situated in the prestigious Dupont Circle area of Washington, DC, and with easy access from all areas in DC, Maryland, and Virginia, the chic lounge bar offering full-service Mediterranean/American fusion dining is heralded as one of DC’s premiere lounges.</p>
<p>The Ozio Lounge is set to become the company’s third location in DC to feature its white label sportsbook solution following in the footsteps of Grand Central Restaurant and Sportsbook and the pending regulatory approval location at the Cloakroom Gentlemen’s Club.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Elys announced its fourth planned sportsbook location in DC at the Entitlement Restaurant and Lounge. The location is still pending approval by the DSLBD.</p>
