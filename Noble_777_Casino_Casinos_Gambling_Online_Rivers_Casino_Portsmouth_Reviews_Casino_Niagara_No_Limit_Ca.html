<p>Pragmatic Play, an iGaming content provider, has deepened its relationship with Betway, a leading gambling company. As a result, Pragmatic Play will power a new Blackjack live studio for the operator.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play to Provide Betway with Live Blackjack</p>
<p>The new Betway offering will allow card game lovers to take their engagement further and enjoy online Blackjack that is just as real as playing at a casino. Through this, Pragmatic Play and Betway hope to deliver an experience that is both immersive and enjoyable.</p>
<p>This makes Betway the latest major casino company to add Pragmatic Play’s live casino offering to its portfolio. For reference, other companies that have adopted the solution include Stake.com, Unibet, a subsidiary of Kindred Group and M88, one of Mansion’s brands.</p>
<p>The new deal expands the two companies’ existing relationship. Betway already has an agreement with the iGaming supplier, thanks to which it can offer Pragmatic Play’s exciting, innovative and varied slots titles and other live casino offerings.</p>
<p>Betway Is Glad to Have Pragmatic Play by Its Side</p>
<p>Yossi Barzely, the chief business development officer of Pragmatic Play commented on the new agreement. He said that his company is pleased to strengthen its relationship with Super Group, Betway’s parent company.</p>
<p>Moreover, Barzely said that he considers Super Group to be a very close company and is looking forward to providing Betway with a dedicated live casino environment. He lauded the operator as a “hugely recognizable” brand in regulated markets and said that this will help to showcase Pragmatic Play’s unparalleled Blackjack studio.</p>
<p>Anthony Werkman, the chief executive officer of Betway, also shared his excitement about the live casino. He emphasized that the operator’s priority is to create memorable gaming experiences for its players. To that end, launching a dedicated live and immersive Blackjack casino is something that will help a lot.</p>
<p>Werkman said that the incredible solutions of Pragmatic Play excite Betway’s team. He praised the supplier for its incredible track record. In the end, Werkman concluded that adding live Blackjack to Betway’s offerings is a tremendous opportunity.</p>
<p>On a separate note, Betway recently became the official sponsor of the Hamburg European Open tennis tournament. The operator vowed to support both the tournament’s men’s and women’s divisions.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Betway expanded its team with the addition of Mohid Chaddah as chief technology officer.</p>
