<p>With the aid of Kambi Group, Brazilian daily fantasy sports operator, Rei do Pitaco, is preparing to make a foray into the world of sports betting</p>
<p>B2B sports betting platform provider Kambi Group has penned a new agreement with Rei do Pitaco, a leading operator of daily fantasy Sports in Brazil. Under the new deal, Kambi will power its new partner with sports betting technology.</p>
<p>Kambi to Provide RDP with Sports Betting Solutions</p>
<p>The agreement will see the global provider leverage its sports betting technology capabilities to allow the local operator to engage its customers with sports betting products. The fantasy operator’s app now has 3.4 million downloads and enjoys a lot of popularity in its native market.</p>
<p>Rei do Pitaco is most popular for its fantasy soccer offerings, as soccer is the most popular sport in Brazil. Thanks to the quality of its products, the operator’s mobile application has cemented its position as one of the fastest-growing apps in the country.</p>
<p>As agreed, Kambi will power Rei do Pitaco with sportsbook tech, allowing the company to venture into real-money sports betting. The provider will bolster the operator by providing it with its customizable tech, APIs and differentiation tools. This will help Rei do Pitaco deliver customized products that are tailored to the needs of local players.</p>
<p>Brazil is currently regulating sports betting. Because of the LATAM country’s love for sports, experts expect it to become a leading sports wagering jurisdiction once its market has been officially launched.</p>
<p>Rei do Pitaco Is Excited to Make a Foray into Sports Betting</p>
<p>Kambi Group’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Kristian Nylén, commented on the agreement and Kambi’s expansion in Brazil. He emphasized the country’s potential to become a leading sports betting market and said that his team is delighted to join forces with Rei do Pitaco.</p>
<p>Nylén lauded the fantasy sports operator as one that is “uniquely positioned to gain a strong position in the country.” He also praised the company for its talented team and ambitious plans for the future. Finally, the CEO called this latest agreement “a testament to the strengths and flexibility” of Kambi’s sportsbook technology. He is sure that Kambi will be able to help Rei do Pitaco become a leading bookmaker.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mateus Dantas, Rei do Pitaco’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said that his team is pleased to have Kambi’s backing. He said that he is looking forward to engaging the operator’s fans with sports betting.</p>
<p>Through this new operation, we are confident of delivering a market-leading online sportsbook to our fast-growing customer database which will have access to an excellent and safe user experience on our platform. Mateus Dantas, CEO, RDP</p>
<p>Rei do Pitaco’s expansion into sports betting is made possible by a recent venture capital investment that the company secured. The Brazilian operator also received backing from FanDuel, whose co-founder, Nigel Eccles, became Rei do Pitaco’s chair.</p>
