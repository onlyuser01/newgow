    <h1>Kentucky Casino Santa Claran Hotel Casino Beau Rivage Resort Casino Desert Diamond Casino Glendale S</h1>

<p>Good afternoon! I believe that 4kingslots Casino wrongfully blocked my account and withheld my $ 890 funds.</p>
<p>I will go into details.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2021, I put my money on withdrawal. For two weeks I wondered why the withdrawal of my funds was not processed?</p>
<p>It was only on November 8 that I received a letter from the casino stating that the $ 1,000 withdrawal had been processed. And on the same day, these funds went to my Skrill payment wallet.</p>
<p>On November 13 and 17, I received $ 2,000 in my wallet.</p>
<p>Thus, the casino credited $ 3,000 out of $ 3,890.</p>
<p>On November 24, when I logged into my account, I discovered that my account was locked, and I received a notification "Your account has been deactivated."</p>
<p>On the same day, I asked the casino for clarification by filling out the appropriate form on the website. Also, while chatting, the casino specialist said that he could not help me and advised me to write to support@universalslots.net to unlock my account.</p>
<p>I followed the advice. In response, I was told that the account was closed for non-standard games.</p>
<p>On November 27, I asked to explain the reasons for blocking my account, as I believe that I did not violate the rules of the casino and, if the casino is convinced otherwise, asked to report what wrongdoing I committed and provide evidence of my guilt.</p>
<p>On December 4, I received a letter from the casino accusing me of "irregular games." The casino did not provide me with any additional comments.</p>
<p>On December 4, I sent a message to the casino asking me to explain the concept of "irregular games", to credit the remaining $ 890, and to state my position on the situation.</p>
<p>I would also like to inform you that my account was previously successfully verified.</p>
<p>Given that the casino does not respond to my requests, and that the problem is not resolved, I have to ask you for help.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
