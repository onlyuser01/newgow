<p>Lauren Seiler Steps in as VP for IR at Rush Street Interactive</p>
<p>Lauren Seiler has been appointed associate vice president of investor relations and development at Rush Street Interactive (RSI), a betting and iGaming company. In his new role, Seiler will lead RSI’s investor relations activities and collaborate with the rest of the team to drive the company’s growth, development, and M&amp;A initiatives in his new role.</p>
<p>Lauren Seiler Is New VP of Investor Relations and Development at RSI</p>
<p>Seiler joins RSI after most recently serving as managing director and head of strategy for global corporate growth and investor relations at Four Wood Capital Partners, a boutique investment management firm.</p>
<p>Seiler previously worked for the Buckingham Research Group as director of institutional equities, specializing in casino and gaming, as well as for Unino Gaming, the Telsey Advisory Group, and Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>Seiler commented on his appointment by saying: “We are in the early stages of development for the greater iGaming and sports betting markets, and Rush Street Interactive is uniquely positioned as a best-in-class operator to both gain share in existing jurisdictions and lead the charge into future jurisdictions around the globe.”</p>
<p>RSI chief financial officer Kyle Sauers added that Seiler brings a profound understanding of the capital markets, as well as a broad network of partnerships and experience with both the sell-side and buy-side groups.</p>
<p>RSI Market and Revenue Growth</p>
<p>As RSI continues to evolve as a pioneer in online gaming, Seiler’s financial and strategic expertise will be invaluable.</p>
<p>Evidence of RSI’s growth comes from several prominent deals that the company made in 2020 and early 2021 as well as a surge of 370% revenue in Q3 2020.</p>
<p>In early February for the first time, RSI and Pariplay collaborated to bring immersive, high-quality content to the regulated US market.</p>
<p>The PlaySugarHouse.com website in New Jersey now offers a range of Pariplay’s iGaming collection of casino games, including Dragons of the North, Wolf Riches, and Amazing Riches.</p>
<p>Following the success of SugarHouse, Rush Street Interactive Pennsylvania, Rush Street Gaming’s Keystone State subsidiary, launched BetRivers, a second high-quality online casino platform in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The games, which are already a success in Europe, are included in the 750 titles already in the iGaming domain of the operator.</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive made $78.2 million in sales in Q3 2020, up 370% from $16.7 million in the same quarter of 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, adjusted Ebitda was $9.9 million, compared to a loss of $1.3 million in the previous year, while real money active users in the United States rose by 135% year over year and by 87% quarterly.</p>
