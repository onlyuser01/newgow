<p>The Peruvian premier soccer league, Liga 1, will be known as Liga 1 Betsson moving right as part of a naming rights deal with Betsson.</p>
<p>Peru’s Liga 1 Takes After Betsson’s Name</p>
<p>Betsson has won the naming rights for Liga 1, Peru’s highest soccer division, after previously becoming the official sports betting partner for the competition in September 2020. The Swedish betting operator is joining Liga 1 in a bid to contribute to soccer in the country and establish its commitment to positive contributions to the sport. Moving forward, Liga 1 will be known as Liga 1 Betsson.</p>
<p>Operating through its local subsidiary, Betsson Peru, the company is looking to consolidate its standing not just in the country but in Latin America. Betsson Group CEO Jesper Svensson was excited about the news, arguing that the company was proud to have forged this new partnership with the Peruvian Football Federation (PFF).</p>
<p>Svensson acknowledged the hardships sports around the world faced, and he said that Betsson is only looking to give back and support soccer during those trying times. Seeing that Peruvian soccer develops one of those, the chief executive added.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership with Liga 1, Betsson’s branding and signage will display across numerous retail and media channels, bolstering the company’s footprint in the company and driving awareness for its products.</p>
<p>Betsson has continued to sponsor Liga 1 as a betting partner, making 2021 the third edition of the competition with the company behind it. Peru’s premier soccer competition features 18 teams. Commenting on the partnership, PFF marketing, and commercial manager Benjamín Romero argued that the partnership was an important stepping stone for the tournament.</p>
<p>Betsson Remains Committed to Peruvian Sports</p>
<p>Romero argued that thanks to the steadfast support Betsson has shown the competition, organizers have been motivated to work hard and see to the betterment of national sports. While sports betting will be a more prevalent topic this season, both the PFF and Betsson will work together to boost responsible gambling and run campaigns raising awareness about the issue.</p>
<p>Betsson stated that the company has the necessary tools to protect consumers and to monitor their betting activity lest they come to harm. The company noted that it brings an array of specialists and experts who use big data to improve Liga 1.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Betsson signed an optimization deal with LeanConvert to boost conversion rates globally.</p>
