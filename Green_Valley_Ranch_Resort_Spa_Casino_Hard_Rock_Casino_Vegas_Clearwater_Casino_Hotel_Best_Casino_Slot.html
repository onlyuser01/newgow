<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Seattle Seahawks Week 17 game is on the program on Sunday, December 31, 2023, at Lumen Field in Seattle with a live broadcast on FOX</p>
<p>Both the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Seattle Seahawks are 8-7 in the 2023 NFL season. Neither team can win the division, but each still stands a chance of making the playoffs through the wild card.</p>
<p>The Seahawks are in a better situation because the competition is less fierce in the National Football Conference (NFC) than in the American Football Conference (AFC) where the Steelers compete. Still, if they lost on the last day of the year, their playoff dream may come to an end.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh Steelers Want to Keep On Winning</p>
<p>The Steelers are coming off a big win over their divisional rivals the Cincinnati Bengals, which brought them back in the playoff race. Their defense was amazing in that game, allowing just one touchdown.</p>
<p>That’s no surprise actually, because they’ve got the seventh-best defense in the league, which is conceding just 19.4 points per game on average.</p>
<p>They also did very well offensively against the Bengals, scoring 34 points. That’s kind of surprising given that their offensive team hasn’t been too impressive in 2023. In fact, their offense is the fifth worst in the NFL with just 17.1 PPG.</p>
<p>In fact, low scoring was the reason why they lost their first three games in December, which is what prompted coach Mike Tomlin to put third-string quarterback Mason Rudolph in the starting lineup. He did great, throwing for 290 yards and two TDs with no interceptions. Can he do the same again?</p>
<p>Seattle Seahawks are a Step Away from the Playoffs</p>
<p>The playoff probability of the Seattle Seahawks is 69% at the moment, but if they win, that number will go all the way up to 88%. Pete Carroll’s men know this, which is why they’re going to take Sunday’s game very seriously.</p>
<p>The good news for them is that they’ve been playing great football lately, winning their last two games. First, they defeated the mighty Philadelphia Eagles 20-17 at home, then, they beat the Tennessee Titans on the road with the same score.</p>
<p>What needs to worry them is that their roster just doesn’t look as great as the one of Pittsburgh. This goes especially for Seattle’s offensive team, which just doesn’t look capable of outsmarting T.J. Watt &amp; Co. But can Seattle’s defense stop the opposition offense? The answer to that question holds the key to who’s going to win the December 31 game.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Seattle Seahawks Prediction</p>
<p>If you compare these two teams player-for-player, the Steelers have the advantage. The Seahawks probably have a better coach and coaching staff, and they’re playing at home on Sunday. Bookies think these things will help them beat the Steelers, but we’re not so sure about that.</p>
<p>We think the boys from Pittsburgh can win on December 31, and even if they don’t do it, they probably won’t lose by more than a field goal.</p>
<p>Pick: Pittsburgh Steelers +3.5</p>
