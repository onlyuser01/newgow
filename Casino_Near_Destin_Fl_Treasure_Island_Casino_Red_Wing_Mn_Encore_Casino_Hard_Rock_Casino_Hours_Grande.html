<p>The Monaco-based casino and hospitality company is parting ways with its long-term EVP of finance, Yves de Toytot</p>
<p>Monte-Carlo Société des Bains de Mer, a Monaco-based casino and hospitality company, has designated Vincent Bouvet as its new chief financial officer. The new hire took office yesterday, April 17, the company said.</p>
<p>Bouvet is a 49-year-old professional who has extensive experience in finance. Prior to joining Monte-Carlo Société des Bains de Mer, the new hire worked for Sodexo Group, a Paris-based French food services and facilities management company.</p>
<p>Bouvet spent two decades with Sodexo Group, first working as financial controller, then as CFO of Central and Eastern Europe. In 2009, he was named CFO of Brazil – a position he held for almost seven years. Eventually, Bouvet moved on to become Sodexo’s group controller and later worldwide CFO of schools and universities. In 2021, Bouvet became the worldwide CFO of schools and government.</p>
<p>The appointee’s time with Sodexo taught him valuable lessons which he will now use to help Monte-Carlo Société des Bains de Mer grow. In his new position, Bouvet will succeed Yves de Toytot who served as EVP of finance before leaving the company to explore other opportunities.</p>
<p>Bouvet’s appointment is a part of the group’s reorganization strategy, which was implemented by chairman Stéphane Valeri. As CFO, he will serve directly under the company’s chief executive officer, Albert Manzone.</p>
<p>The Company Wished Yves de Toytot All the Best</p>
<p>Chair Valeri thanked Yves de Toytot for his hard work, noting that the outgoing EVP has been with the company since 1997. He has served the company as financial controller, chief financial officer and deputy chief financial officer and has done a lot of work to grow the company.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Yves de Toytot, who has been with the company since 1997 as Financial Controller, then Chief Financial Officer in 2004 and since 2011 as Deputy Chief Financial Officer, for all the work carried out with his teams over the years, during which he has implemented numerous financial projects from both a structural and operational point of view. Stéphane Valeri, chair &amp; deputy, Monte-Carlo Société des Bains de Mer</p>
<p>Valeri concluded that de Toytot did a good job in managing and directing the company’s finance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the chairman welcomed Bouvet to the company, wishing him a successful tenure as CFO of Monte-Carlo Société des Bains de Mer.</p>
