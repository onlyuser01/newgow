    <h1>The Linq Hotel Casino New Casino Sloto Casino Longhorn Casino Hotel Blue Chip Casino BET90 Casino Pl</h1>

<p>Greetings. I am using this page to show my discontent with Bet90. I have been trying to withdraw my money for 3 weeks that I obtained thanks to the sports welcome bonus, which I released by fulfilling all the conditions and betting my entire initial deposit. Unfortunately I must say that the Bet90 support staff (chat) apparently has instructions not to be transparent about the reasons why withdrawals are not approved. In my first withdrawal attempts (for 2 weeks) they claimed that my orders were being rejected because for Directa24 my bank details were incorrect. But I was able to talk to Directa24 on Facebook and they told me that this was false, that for them I have never made any withdrawals, and that Bet90 was always the one that rejected my withdrawals.</p>
<p>Then I tried Mifinity... it's a form of payment but you can neither deposit nor withdraw.</p>
<p>This last week I tried for FTN (tokens). I deposited by that means, I bet and made the withdrawal request (On June 5), being approved in 12 hours and finally I was able to withdraw 10 USD. After 24 hours of my first request by FTN, I requested a withdrawal again (On June 6), and that is the one that has not been approved yet. The ones in the chat forwarded me the details of my transaction and supposedly for them my withdrawal request was made on June 7... which is false... it was made on June 6. And since their withdrawal policies are processed up to a maximum of 3 business days, that term was fulfilled today Friday, but since their system has changed the day (supposedly), now it was left for Monday. In addition, they argued that the payment provider has an international schedule, and that is why the day has been changed (June 7)... Which is false because my 1st withdrawal was requested on June 5 at the same time (16 :00pm) and there it reflects to them as it was also June 5th. I am very tired of so many excuses and I would like the representative of Bet90 casino to speak with those in charge of the financial area so that they already approve my withdrawal.</p>
<p>In the images you can see that my account is verified and the times that withdrawals have been rejected, which is the reason for my distrust despite the fact that at least 1 withdrawal has been validated, since there are so many cases of problems in the withdrawals, it seems that Bet90 likes to keep the money from the winnings as long as they can...</p>
