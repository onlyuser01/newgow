    <h1>Borgata Online Casino New Jersey Casino Hotels In Vicksburg Ms Casino In Tulsa Ok Red Wind Casino Bo</h1>

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I was recently a VIP customer at casinomoons. Not only has my status reduced to silver for some unknown reason. I also no longer have a vip status. I have deposited at the casino many of times. I had time away from the casino as it was always suspicious. I had an email regarding free 25 spins. I know the terms and conditions of bonus free spins as I have been a vip customer at online casinos for years. I obliged by all the rules, bets per spin, wagering. everything. I actually won 230 however the maximum is 100 AUD for silver, which is fine, the feel is almost 30 dollars for bank transfer also fine. I was assured my winning would be in my account by 2-3 business days, my account is verified for years now. on the 1st of september I withdrew the money now its the 7th of september, after waiting i decided to log in, then i realized my "winnings were put back into my account" i asked why? they told me you must deposit 5 days before you can withdraw. after knowing their terms and conditions for years, they had suspiciously added a term in their "banking business terms" NOT bonus rules terms and conditions. even though ive deposited 1000's here. If a casino is going to change their terms and conditions they must inform the customer of this (which they didnt) in the bonus terms it states as long as you have made "one" deposit. therefore they are breaching their own bonus terms and conditions to avoid paying out 70 dollars from 100 from a previous vip member. I want this resolved. otherwise I will be writing articles about this casino being a fraud. I have never had a withdraw from here and there is a reason i stop depositing, as lots of their "rules were too shady" they would hide things and they would do things such as give bonus vip money to make you have to wager the money when you made your own deposit already. I hope the guru can help me as they have in the past. I am very well aware of every terms and conditons in every casino, i dont like to be deceived by casinos and i certainly dont like when they suspicouly change their terms and conditons in the wrong section to hide this fact and also not even notify me after being a vip member for years and reducing my tier.</p>
<p>kind regards</p>
