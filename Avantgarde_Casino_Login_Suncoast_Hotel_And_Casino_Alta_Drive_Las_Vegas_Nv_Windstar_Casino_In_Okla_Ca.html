    <h1>Avantgarde Casino Login Suncoast Hotel And Casino Alta Drive Las Vegas Nv Windstar Casino In Okla Ca</h1>

<p>I signed up to Race and deposited 2500 EUR. I played for a while, and ended up losing 550 EUR. I then submitted a 1950 EUR withdrawal request. This has triggered a KYC loop. I submitted ID and proof of address. This was accepted. However, they also wanted proof of funds and proof of wealth.</p>
<p>I was able to prove the source of the funds deposited. However, Race Casino now decided they will not be happy until they establish the source of the entirety of my net worth. They are asking for statement after statement, I have sent well over 10 statements at this point and they keep going.</p>
<p>I have given up and asked them to close my account and return the funds. Even though I am at a net loss on the casino, they are holding my funds hostage until they are happy. I have proven the exact source of the funds I played with, and they are refusing to return them because they want to get all statements from investments that are totally unrelated to the funds I gambled with.</p>
<p>I ask that Race Casino close my account and pay out the withdrawal request.</p>
