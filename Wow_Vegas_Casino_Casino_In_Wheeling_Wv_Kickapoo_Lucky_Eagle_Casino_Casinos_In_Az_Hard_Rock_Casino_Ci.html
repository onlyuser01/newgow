<p>Gambling operator Rush Street Interactive has inked a new deal with Neccton, a B2B gambling solutions company. The agreement will see Neccton power the operator with solutions that help it to protect its players.</p>
<p>Neccton Will Help Rush Street Protect Its Players</p>
<p>Neccton will provide Rush Street Interactive with its real-time data analysis player protection solution, mentor. Mentor helps to identify changes in players’ spending behavior and track high-risk players. The AI-powered solution recognizes various triggers, including increased deposits and alerts the operator. This helps operators intervene in time and prevent gambling harm among their players.</p>
<p>Rush Street will add the mentor solution to BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse, its two North America-oriented brands.</p>
<p>The addition of Neccton’s acclaimed solution comes a few months after Rush Street Interactive received a prestigious accreditation. Back in March, the Responsible Gambling Council praised Rush Street’s NA brands for their efforts and awarded them with RG Check iGaming Accreditation. It should be noted that Rush Street is the first US iGaming and sports betting company to receive this honor.</p>
<p>Rush Street Is the First US Company to Adopt the Solution</p>
<p>Richard Schwartz, the chief executive of Rush Street Interactive, spoke about the partnership with Neccton. He lauded the supplier as a “well-respected global leader in player protection products” and said that he is glad to have it by Rush Street’s side. Schwartz also said that the collaboration with Neccton attests to Rush Street’s commitment of its corporate social responsibility strategy.</p>
<p>It is imperative we ensure both our valued players and team members have the tools and resources necessary to help ensure a culture of responsible gambling and sustainable play. Richard Schwartz, CEO, Rush Street Interactive</p>
<p>Dr Michael Auer, Neccton’s head of development, described North America as a region with a very diverse regulatory landscape. He said that he feels honored that Rush Street Interactive has trusted Neccton with helping it navigate this ever-changing landscape.</p>
<p>Auer noted that Rush Street will be the first US company to adopt Neccton’s powerful tool. He promised that Neccton will do everything in its power to help Rush Street remain compliant and take care of its players.</p>
<p>Our research has shown that players who gamble responsibly are more loyal, and their customer lifetime is significantly longer, so there is real value when a player is cared for by an operator. Dr Michael Auer, head of development, Neccton</p>
<p>Two days ago, Neccton teamed up with the German operator Mernov and agreed to provide it with the proven and tested mentor solution. A month ago, Neccton also signed a deal with PressEnter’s brands.</p>
