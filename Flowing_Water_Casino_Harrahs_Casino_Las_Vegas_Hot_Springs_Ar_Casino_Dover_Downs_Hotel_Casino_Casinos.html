    <h1>Flowing Water Casino Harrahs Casino Las Vegas Hot Springs Ar Casino Dover Downs Hotel Casino Casinos</h1>

<p>Screenshots and having someone video your play will do it but then why play if it’s that corrupt or unfair ! When you show any software provider screenshots or video they will be able to tell you that there games shouldn’t or would never play that way ! Do you think a software / game maker would make a program that jerks stops changes speeds logs you out doesn’t give credit towards x play from time to time or spinning from 3 seconds one spin to 10 seconds etc ? No they won’t and they don’t so when you see screen jumping or speed changing and where a slot will hit the breaks and your slot / stop button is being overridden that when you hit stop nothing happens? That’s because it’s been overridden!! The software provider isn’t going to create crap like that so they can be sued by everyone and I’m shocked that they don’t have someone checking on the the software they sell to these casino’s because in a month or so everybody will be using manipulated pirated copies and in the last year it went up 1000 percent! By the way where are all these jackpot winners that’s posted on every slot you play ? Why don’t they post who won and not bogus fake names ? Why don’t they start proving to us that they aren’t cheating instead of us having to prove it ? Who is the customer here ? Without our $$$ they don’t exist and I want proof as to who’s Winning these jackpots because I’ve never won one and spent over 200k the end is near and there’s another big reason why the end is near as well and that will be announced very soon 👍✌️👍🤷🏼‍♂️</p>
