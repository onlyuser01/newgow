    <h1>Bonners Ferry Casino Hollywood Casino Toledo Ohio Casino Map The Office Casino Night Casino Hotel In</h1>

<p>I had bought shares from the casino in TFS tokens in USD.</p>
<p>At some point I wanted to pay out part of it in ETH and gamble it there in the casino as credit.</p>
<p>I did the payouts normally, as advertised there and wanted.</p>
<p>My 2 withdrawals of 1,2000 TFS tokens each were never paid out.</p>
<p>I was told you have to withdraw in the same currency you deposited with, after that I was ignored and the casino was not willing to entertain or come to an agreement.</p>
<p>There is no reference to the rule anywhere. On the contrary..</p>
<p>It was very heavily advertised.</p>
<p>In the last complaint the casino complained about the subject...</p>
<p>"There are no tokens in your account" They tried to get rid of me with that.</p>
<p>The comment from the casino does not refer to the problem and is only an unfriendly saying after a scam/trick...</p>
<p>My tokens were of course debited from my account but never converted and paid out.</p>
<p>Of course I don't have any tokens afterwards and that shows how they don't care about the customers.</p>
<p>It won't even be checked to see what's going on.</p>
<p>Photos etc with the payment procedure and payment histories were always included.</p>
