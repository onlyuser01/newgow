    <h1>Real Money Casino No Deposit Casino Terre Haute Harrahs Casino Near Me Milky Way Casino Commerce Cas</h1>

<p>It's true that I've played at that casino before without any problems and my other deposits have worked as they should. Now I got 30 free spins and when I had played them and pressed grab your winnings, which was a little over 19 euros, the page flashed brightly as if it had been updated again and the funds I won did not appear in my account. I thought that if I go to the lobby it will probably show up, but it didn't, so I logged out and back in. It didn't show up even then. I immediately contacted the live chat and explained what happened and they replied that Juu is a known problem and we will solve this as quickly as possible. Well, it took 4 days for me to ask about it and it was still being processed by technical support, then a week had passed, then 2, and then it was already 3 weeks, and every week I asked about it at least 2 times on the live chat side and also by e-mail, but the answer is always the same that it is being processed. Well, next Wednesday it will be one month since what happened. I have tried to ask for a direct email address for technical support and ask if there is even such a department. How can it take almost a month to look at the data of 1 person's game account, what he has spun, when, with what bet, etc. It's a really bad service, I can't recommend it to anyone, and I'm sure that after this mess, I won't make a single deposit on that page. Even if there was an apology bonus. I would understand a maximum of maybe 2 weeks, even that is already too much. I'm saying now this crappy casino to deal with problems.</p>
