    <h1>Asbury Park Casino Indianapolis Casino Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Las Vegas New Jersey Casino Al</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I reclaim my entire deposits totaling €720 from Asino Casino.</p>
<p>I made several deposits there and clearly clicked NO BONUS on every deposit. Which is why I assume, of course, that I will not get any bonuses.</p>
<p>I like to buy bonus buys around €20 or €40.</p>
<p>It was only after my balance was zero that I realized that Asino Casino kept giving me bonuses worth €1.50 while I was playing. I was credited with the €1.50 a total of 11 times and of course each of these bonuses has a wagering requirement and a max bet, which of course I then violated.</p>
<p>The chat says I could simply issue the bonuses so that these VIP bonuses are credited to me. I didn't know about this though and any other casino will NEVER award bonuses without an acknowledgment. Having selected NO BONUS when making my deposits, I can safely assume that I will NOT receive any bonuses either. At least none that are simply credited to me.</p>
<p>So I never had a chance to win anything. Any subsequent deposit I made would never have resulted in a payout because the casino would then accuse me of violating their terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I certainly don't deposit real money if I can never win anything with it.</p>
<p>This is pure deception what the casino has done and want my money back. It is completely dishonest to credit bonuses without my consent and I have expressly selected NO BONUSES when making my deposits. The chat also cheekily claims that I switched something on and off again. That's not true. I just made a deposit and decided against bonuses. I have never adjusted anything in the menu. The fact that the sums are so small, €1.50 each time, also shows that the casino is acting with fraudulent intent.</p>
<p>I really hope you guys can help me and are not on the casino side. It's incredibly outrageous and I've never experienced anything like it.</p>
