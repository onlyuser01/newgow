<p>SOFTSWISS, a provider of online iGaming solutions and an innovator in the use of digital currencies for the purposes of gaming, has released a new update for its comprehensive solution. The company has reported that it has created a new in-game currency conversion feature that is now incorporated into its dedicated casino platform which will enable players to convert their cryptocurrency balances into nine available FIAT currencies.</p>
<p>Nine Conversion Cryptocurrencies to Pick From</p>
<p>The feature offers players more control over their own bankrolls and empowers them to navigate both FIAT and cryptocurrency balances, providing for a seamless transition between the two. Moving forward, SOFTSWISS-powered casinos will offer players the option to convert their cryptocurrencies into USD, EUR, AUD, RUB, CAD, NZD, NOK, JPY, or BRL. The tool itself is simply called “In-Game Currency Conversion” and it’s part of the company’s continued effort to innovate and make the cryptocurrency gaming experience more accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>As an added benefit, players can also use the feature to bet with cryptocurrencies on games that do not natively support cryptocurrencies as one of their available currencies. SOFTSWISS head of casino platform Darya Avtukhovich welcomed the opportunity. She noted that players were previously only restricted to US dollars conversions only, but this has now changed. She added:</p>
<p>The range of available games was limited by currency. However, game diversity brings diverse emotions and experiences. So, this time we have implemented multi-currency support. Players can now convert cryptos into more fiat currencies and enjoy a greater variety of games. SOFTSWISS head of casino platform Darya Avtukhovich</p>
<p>The Casino Platform which SOFTSWISS has coined is multi-functional software that has been the backbone of the company’s expansion. SOFTSWISS has been able to create compelling iGaming platforms, games, and products that resonate with a global audience and allow operators to considerably innovate their proposition by seamlessly implementing innovative features into its offer and powering the iGaming experience for everyone. Recently, SOFTSWISS helped Spin Samurai with its jackpot solution.</p>
