<p>Software solutions provider Digitain has signed a partnership deal with leading content provider Pariplay Ltd.</p>
<p>A Mutually-Beneficial Agreement</p>
<p>Award-winning platform provider Digitain has announced that it has entered a new content distribution partnership with leading content provider Pariplay Ltd. Through the deal, Pariplay content as well as its innovative Fusion aggregation platform and Ignite Studio software will be distributed to Digitain’s B2B partners.</p>
<p>This mutually-beneficial deal will expand the available content for multi-channel gaming platform Digitain’s 75 iGaming partners and at the same time greatly extend the reach of Pariplay’s IPs, services and games, which have already proven themselves as successful products. This includes popular and top-performing titles such as Kings of the Trident Deluxe, Dragons of the North Deluxe, Mystery Fox, Wolf Riches, Stallion Fortunes and more.</p>
<p>Partners Share Confidence in Deal</p>
<p>According to Digitain Head of External Communications Samvel Mkrtumyan, Digitain and Pariplay share many of the same core values in client-orientation and drive for innovation. “We look forward to reaping the benefits of their portfolio of engaging games that are so highly popular at an international level and also leveraging their cutting-edge marketing tools, to drive our own product forward.”, Mr Mkrtumyan said.</p>
<p>Pariplay Ltd Managing Director Adrian Bailey shares Mr Mkrtumyan’s confidence in the agreement. According to Mr Bailey, the partnership will boost the reach of the company’s unique game content as well as that of its third-party partners and help them enter even more markets across the world.</p>
<p>“We see our offering as an excellent fit for this global platform provider and we look forward to developing a long-term partnership with them as we continue to grow our regulated market footprint.”, Mr Bailey added.</p>
<p>Further Accomplishments</p>
<p>Digitain was originally founded in 1999 in Armenia as a national lottery and has since grown into the renowned and innovative multi-channel gaming platform it is known as today. Over the years, the company has managed to cement itself as a premier iGaming operator and has earned the trust of over 75 iGaming partners across the globe. Digitain has also received multiple awards over the years, with the most recent being Top Skill Games Supplier at the EGR B2B Awards 2020 and Fast Growing Online Platform at BEGE Awards 2019, among others.</p>
<p>Pariplay Ltd is a relative newcomer on the market, being founded in 2010. However, within its relatively short activity time, it has managed to impress with its capacity for innovation as well as the sheer power of its flagship products – the Fusion aggregation platform and the Ignite Studio development software, which have managed to attract a sizeable amount of interested parties, including MGA Games.</p>
