<p>A naked man who stole a police car and caused a serious crash, injuring two people, was arrested earlier this week in Las Vegas. The incident dates to around 11 PM on Tuesday when police responded to a call about a naked male that was around Blue Diamond Road and South Buffalo Drive. As announced by KTNV, the naked man was “possibly experiencing a mental health crisis.” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) received a call about the individual and was dispatched to the site.</p>
<p>Upon arrival of the police officer, the man reportedly attacked him. In the resulting fistfight and commotion, the suspect was able to flee the scene after hopping into the police vehicle and driving off. The police officer on the scene immediately reported that his car, an LVMPD-marked Ford F-150, was stolen and pursuit of the suspect began.</p>
<p>The culprit was speeding through the city streets for several minutes. At approximately 11:15 PM on the same night, the suspect ran a red light near Hacienda. This resulted in a crash with another vehicle, a Ford Explorer that was crossing the intersection at a green light.</p>
<p>In the collision, the driver and passenger of the Ford Explorer were injured. The culprit with the stolen police vehicle also suffered injuries. Reportedly the two people from the Ford Explorer were in critical condition and were rushed to hospital. The naked man who stole the police car was apprehended and consequently transported to University Medical Center where his injuries were treated. The LVMPD police officer who responded to the initial call had minor injuries after the fight.</p>
<p>The Culprit Faces Four Charges</p>
<p>The suspect for the crime was identified by police as a 29-year-old Las Vegas resident with the initials C.C. Citing court documents, KLAS revealed Wednesday that the culprit is facing four charges. Those include battery on a protected person, grand larceny of a motor vehicle, robbery and driver disobeying peace officer and endangering people or property.</p>
<p>Currently, Nevada’s laws designate grand larceny of a motor vehicle as a category B felony, considering that the car is worth more than $3,500. The crime is punishable by one to 10 years in prison and a fine of no more than $10,000 along with restitution.</p>
<p>On the other hand, battery carries a prison sentence between two to a maximum of 10 years as another category B felony. Similarly, robbery is also a category B felony in Nevada. People convicted of robbery may be subject to a prison term between two to 15 years.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old responsible for the crash and theft of the police car on Tuesday is set to appear in court on Thursday. It is yet to be confirmed what penalty he may face for the crimes he allegedly committed.</p>
