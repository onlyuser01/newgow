<p>The leading global gaming company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced a new collaboration with the Oregon Lottery. IGT said Monday that it agreed to provide its video lottery account-based cashless solutions for the Lottery. Thanks to this collaboration, the Oregon Lottery will leverage the leading cashless technologies for more than 11,500 of its video lottery terminals (VLTs) around the state.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by IGT, its technology integrates seamlessly with INTELLIGEN, a central system that all VLTs connect to in the state. The recent collaboration enables the Lottery to develop a website that can be used by the players to redeem winnings from VLTs.</p>
<p>In addition to claiming winnings from video lottery tickets, IGT's technology offers additional functions via its IGTPay payment gateway. The innovative solution grants access to secure and compliant options for funding. In other words, players that use the payment gateway can easily fund their accounts.</p>
<p>Ryan Reddy, IGT's SVP, Global Product Management, VLT Systems, Payments and Poker, shared his excitement in a statement released on October 10, 2022. He said: "The Oregon Lottery operates one of the most successful VLT programs in North America and the integration of IGT's INTELLIGEN cashless solutions will enable many player benefits while offering flexibility to meet evolving market expectations and regulations."</p>
<p>He explained that in the last two years, the interest in cashless solutions increased significantly. Last but not least, Reddy said that IGT is happy with the Oregon Lottery's decision and looks forward to maximizing the contributions to good causes thanks to the new technology.</p>
<p>Barry Pack, the Oregon Lottery's director, added that IGT's solution will enable players of the Lottery's VLTs to save their winnings to their accounts. According to him, the function removes the paper ticket which can be lost by the player or even stolen in some cases. In conclusion, Pack said: "It's also another small step towards knowing more about who plays our games which is a long-term goal of ours."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in June, IGT unveiled another partnership with a lottery operator. The company's subsidiary, IGT Global Solutions Corporation, extended its collaboration with the Kansas Lottery for 10 years. This means that the duo will continue to collaborate through December 2032.</p>
<p>The recent partnership expands IGT's growing list of partners. As a global gaming leader, by now, the company offers its services to operators, regulators and governments in more than 100 countries around the globe.</p>
