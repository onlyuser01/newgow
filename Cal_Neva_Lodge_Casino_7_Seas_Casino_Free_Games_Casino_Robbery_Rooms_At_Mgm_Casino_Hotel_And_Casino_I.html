    <h1>Cal Neva Lodge Casino 7 Seas Casino Free Games Casino Robbery Rooms At Mgm Casino Hotel And Casino I</h1>

<p>Light &amp; Wonder has selected a new chief financial officer to lead the company's financials after looking for the right candidate since August</p>
<p>The newly-appointed Oliver Chow served as an interim CFO since August and previously worked as SVP of corporate finance. He succeeded at the time Connie James who stepped down from the permanent position to pursue other career opportunities.</p>
<p>The Hunt for a New CFO Is Finally Over</p>
<p>Chow is a well-seasoned veteran and also an EVP and treasurer at Light &amp; Wonder, making him deeply involved with the company’s structure and ethos, and motivated to push the boundaries of the operations the company is bringing to market and engaged with.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder CEO Matt Wilson was very happy with the permanent appointment of someone he saw as a worthwhile addition to the company and an individual with a proven track record within its structures. Wilson commented on the appointment of his colleague:</p>
<p>Over the last four months, we’ve all been impressed with Oliver’s ability to seamlessly step into the role of chief financial officer. With more than 15 years of entertainment and gaming leadership experience and deep financial expertise, Oliver was the candidate best positioned to lead us forward. Light &amp; Wonder CEO Matt Wilson</p>
<p>He praised Chow’s meticulousness and ability to rise to the occasion unprompted, bringing immense value to the organization’s efforts and potential to grow steadily. Chow has held multiple positions around the industry and beyond. He held senior-level finance positions in rival Aristocrat and also worked for Universal Pictures, JPMorgan Chase, and Deluxe Entertainment Services.</p>
<p>He is well-versed in finance and his stint in Aristocrat acquainted him with the specificity of the gambling industry as well. Chow is joining the company at a time when it is showing a lot of good financial results. For one, the recent acquisition of SciPlay has already propped Light &amp; Wonder’s third-quarter financials and is likely to continue doing so in the future.</p>
