<p>Dabble has inked a new agreement with Primer with the purpose of diversifying its list of payment options for native customers</p>
<p>Australian-based social betting platform Dabble has announced a fresh partnership with Primer, the pioneer payment orchestration and commerce automation infrastructure on the globe.</p>
<p>The news comes in the context of the Australian government’s decision to start regulating the use of credit cards on sports wagers online, an announcement that automatically initiated operators’ shift to alternative banking options.</p>
<p>Growth Plans Continue for Dabble</p>
<p>Last month, the socially-charged operator that calls itself the “betting app of today” also announced that it would make its entry into the eSport vertical with the help of PandaScore.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, in February, Dabble completed the acquisition of Moneyball Australia, a mobile sports betting platform. The acquisition was also part of Dabble’s expansion plan in the local market.</p>
<p>The operator also recently signed an AU$33 million ($21.3 million) deal with Tabcorp, Australia’s largest gambling company with over 5,000 employees, for an equity interest set at 20%.</p>
<p>The new Primer partnership is additional proof of the company’s main goal to expand and change the online experience that it offers to customers while improving its fraud protection policies.</p>
<p>Primer will help Dabble offer a more diversified selection of banking methods to its casual sports betting aficionado, just in time for the Spring Racing Carnival, Australia’s premier racing carnival running from August to November. The list will include popular options like Apple Pay and Google.</p>
<p>Primer, “Very Excited” to Support Dabble with Improved Payment Experiences</p>
<p>Primer’s head of ANZ, Sameer Talwar, expressed the company’s excitement regarding the new partnership that would allow them to support Dabble with better payment experiences for their users.</p>
<p>Talwar also commented on the growing demand for “a unified approach to payment methods, fraud and commerce services” noticed during their expansion in Australia and New Zealand, further strengthening the idea that getting access to a plethora of providers would be essential to speed up their growth.</p>
<p>Dabble’s chief executive officer, Tom Rundle, also commented on the new agreement that came “at a pivotal moment” for them in the context of their fast-expanding digital database of native customers.</p>
<p>Rundle also explained that payments that are safe and seamless should be a critical part of a “great social betting experience,” further commenting that the decision to partner with Primer should help them change the future of wagering in Australia and beyond.</p>
