    <h1>Magic Casino Intertops Classic Casino Draft King Casino Fontainebleau Casino Cherokee Casino Roland</h1>

<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>Asking here is not going to work. Admins do not deal with complaints, and complaints handlers are non-present here on the forum - I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Well, I checked out the rejected complaint (closed due to insufficient evidence), and I feel it is probably quite similar to the last one, right?</p>
<p>Well, I think this statement is pretty clear:</p>
<p>"Secondly, the term clearly says that you should send an email if you want to permanently close your account due to gambling addiction, which you didn't do. If you did so, you could easily have proof of such action and our approach to this case would be completely different. You must understand that if the casino shares simple and clear instructions on how to request self-exclusion and you didn't follow them, and on top of that you don't have any proof the casino has been informed about your gambling problem, our options are very limited. I assure you that whenever a player provided valid evidence confirming they requested self-exclusion due to gambling addiction, we did everything we could do to help."</p>
<p>And as far as I see, there is again no mention of the gambling problem in the second (still open) complaint.</p>
<p>I strongly advise you to ask your account to be closed due to gambling issues next time you feel like you need to exclude yourself, otherwise, it will probably end up the same.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to help you understand that asking your account to be closed permanently means no real protection. This is not understood as a self-exclusion.</p>
<p>Believe me when I say I understand you're not happy about the current events.</p>
