<p>The last day of 2023 brings us some exciting NFL duels, with the Miami Dolphins vs. Baltimore Ravens being one of those that stand out. Both teams are in great form, with the Ravens beating the San Francisco 49ers last weekend and the Dolphins doing better than the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

<p>Miami Dolphins Hoping for Another Win on the Road</p>

<p>It was Miami‚Äôs seventh win on home turf in 2023, but what about their record on the road? Well, playing away from home has been their problem this season.</p>
<p>The Dolphins are 4-3 on the road, with their wins happening only against teams that are currently under .500 ‚Äì the Washington Commanders (4-11 record), New York Jets (6-9), New England Patriots (4-11), and Los Angeles Chargers (5-10).</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens to Book the No. 1 Seed</p>
<p>The Ravens are 12-3, which is one more win than the Dolphins, who are currently second in the AFC. As there are only two more games left to be played, winning on Sunday would practically mean booking the No. 1 spot in the conference.</p>
<p>So, can they do it? Well, their recent form sure is giving them a lot of confidence. They won their last five games, even though their schedule was pretty tough. This goes especially for their most recent game, which saw them beat the 49ers 33-19 on the road.</p>
<p>The Ravens entered that game as seven-point underdogs but ended up winning by 14 points. Quarterback Lamar Jackson was brilliant, throwing for 252 yards and two touchdowns. Still, it‚Äôs Baltimore‚Äôs defense that stole the show by recording four interceptions against San Francisco‚Äôs QB Brock Purdy, as well as one against Sam Darnold.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins vs. Baltimore Ravens Week 17 Prediction</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins are the No. 1 offense in the league, but we just can‚Äôt see them do much against the NFL‚Äôs best defense. The Baltimore Ravens‚Äô defensive team will stop them, and Lamar Jackson &amp; Co. will wreak havoc on Miami‚Äôs defense, meaning that the host should cover the -3.5-point spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Baltimore Ravens -3.5</p>
