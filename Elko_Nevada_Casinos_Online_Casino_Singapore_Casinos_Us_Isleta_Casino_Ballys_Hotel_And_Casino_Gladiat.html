<p>hahaha i contact with many providers, Nolimit also contact with me for feedback, i spend time to give him good feedback and guess what? They dont care, because they dont answer.....</p>
<p>Now slots with bonus buy for "super bonus" or 1million megaways and still you get average 8 dead spins of 12 bonus spins is so bad, nothing about RANDOM, because if it's random i can get sometimes a ton of connections and can get max win, ALSO so many casinos have a bug, and when you start bonus, or in the moment you buy it, you already see final win in the right corner on your balance, i mean, is NOT RANDOM, you just buy it, and watch a animated movie but outcome is already predicted...</p>
<p>Nolimit fan website, is a new and they have the same bug, and now they try to hide this with blur effect, whitch is so bad, to make the fans stupid.</p>
<p>It's the same like lottery tickets where all wins are printed already and you just buy, but still you have choice whitch one ticket to buy, in online slots, the server choose how much to pay you, and you just watch how you ripping in the most cases.</p>
<p>And this is fair? LMAO ðŸ˜€</p>
