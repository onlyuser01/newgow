    <h1>St Louis Casinos Hotels Casino Card Game Rules Cafe Casino Lv Winstar Casino Hotel Reservations Borg</h1>

<p>Dear Gisela,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://slottyvegas.com/en/terms-of-service:</p>
<p>"Unless otherwise stipulated, withdrawals stemming from complimentary free spins or no-deposit bonuses will be capped at a maximum amount of €/$/20/NOK/SEK200/RUB1500/2300円/80zł for players who do not have a depositing history, and €/$/100/SEK/NOK1000/RUB7500/11500円/400zł for players that do have a depositing history at the casino, irrespective of the amount of bonus funds turned real. However, this cap may be increased at casino discretion depending on player loyalty status. Deposits placed into an active bankroll obtained from said free spins bonuses will be refunded and the cap implemented irrespective of gameplay following the deposit."</p>
<p>As soon as the wagering requirements have been completed your winnings became withdrawable. They don’t turn into real money, au contraire, they still carry maximum cash out €20.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have deposited any funds into your account?</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play, especially when it comes to No Deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
