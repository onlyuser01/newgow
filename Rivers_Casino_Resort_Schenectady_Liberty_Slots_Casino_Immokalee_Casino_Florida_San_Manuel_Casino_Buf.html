<p>The name of Ryan Pace, a political activist and lawyer, has appeared on the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA)’s website as the regulator’s new chairman.</p>
<p>Ryan Pace Floated as New MGA Chairman</p>
<p>The Maltese gaming regulator is reportedly tapping Ryan Pace for the position of the watchdog’s new chairman. Pace already appears on the Board of Governors but there has been no official announcement by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) to confirm the appointment just yet, SBC News reported.</p>
<p>Pace is a fairly young candidate, and possibly the youngest to hold the position if his appointment is finalized. His career spans Abela Advocates, Maltese Prime Minister Robert Abela’s law firm.</p>
<p>He first worked at the company in 2015 following his graduation as a Bachelor of Laws. Pace followed with a degree of Doctor of Laws in 2017, and he has been working at Abela Advocates full-time since 2018. Back in June, he was appointed as MGA’s deputy chairman, making the present listing a natural continuation of his career trajectory.</p>
<p>No additional information is currently available on MGA’s website, but Pace’s name is visible at the Board of Governors’ page. Pace is also a political activist for the Labor Party, which has been, according to The Shift, a local media outlet, the cause for concern among stakeholders.</p>
<p>While The Shift avoided mentioning any names, the media made a broad statement that industry people were concerned about Pace’s “lack of experience in the gambling industry” and his political allegiance.</p>
<p>Bringing a young and inexperienced hire does not support MGA’s mission to be seen as a respected regulatory body in the sector, one anonymous stakeholder said cited by the outlet.</p>
<p>This is a second high-profile shift within the Maltese gaming regulator following the appointment of Dr Carl Brincat as chief executive in January, replacing Heathcliff Farrugia, the long-time incumbent, who decided to leave for a job in the private sector.</p>
