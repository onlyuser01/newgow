<p>Sports IQ, the North American-based oddsmaker and player prop supplier, has inked a deal with sports betting operator Betway. Under the partnership, Sports IQ will provide Betway with pre-game and in-play betting options on player props across the sportsbook’s entire portfolio of operations in the United States.</p>
<p>Betway Strengthens Its Player Prop Offering in US</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Sports IQ CEO Omer Dor expressed his satisfaction with the deal and praised Betway for the status the company has been able to gain as a leading operator in sports gambling worldwide. He added that Betway’s reputation was well-deserved and backed by millions of satisfied customers.</p>
<p>“We are humbled by having Sports IQ’s products be a part of that offering. We look forward to working with Betway to power their continued success in North America and globally,” Dor concluded.</p>
<p>Betway marketing and operations director Paul Adkins joined the conversation and said that he was pleased with the established partnership. “We have been aware of the quality of products and services from Sport[s] IQ for some time. They were the natural choice when we were looking for a new supplier in this field,” said Adkins.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the operator will be working closely with Sports IQ and continue to provide customers with better player props options when it comes to the global sports betting market.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sports IQ has been making headlines. The company agreed to a similar multi-year player props odds deal with FansUnite Entertainment, and before that, in June, the company negotiated another partnership with Chalkline to power the latter’s free-to-play games. Earlier this year, Spots IQ raised $7 million in fresh funding, planning to boosts its overall sports betting operations and service reach.</p>
