    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Las Vegas Restaurants In The Crown Casino Melbourne Foxwood Casino Connecticu</h1>

<p>NeoGames SA subsidiary and Pariplay has expanded its aggregation platform through the addition of Kiron, a prominent developer and supplier of virtual games for the iGaming sector</p>
<p>Kiron is a prominent company that develops outstanding products built to thrive in a market that is highly contested.</p>
<p>Pariplay Doubles Down on Virtual Sports Content</p>
<p>The studio will make a worthwhile addition to the Fusion platform, owned and developed by Pariplay, which brings together third-party brands to create a rich library of gaming options for players.</p>
<p>Kiron will provide a number of market-leading virtual sports to join Fusion’s massive portfolio of more than 14,000 games and 80 suppliers. Fusion provides a comprehensive suite of tools that are designed to significantly boost player engagement and enhance its value.</p>
<p>Fusion has a significant market advantage as well, as the platform combines a number of different games together, including instant, virtual, and fantasy sports, poker, and bingo, live games, and not least sportsbook and casino games, such as popular slots, table titles, and more.</p>
<p>The unique API allows partner operators to integrate in a seamless and quick manner without any additional integrated-related work necessary to get started. Kiron, which has more than 50 virtual sports titles, is a trendsetter in the industry and it’s prepared to disrupt and bring more titles that change the fabric of gameplay.</p>
<p>Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris has welcomed the opportunity and said that virtual content is a significant part of what Fusion wants to offer. Kiron is a leading specialist and developer in the vertical, making it a great fit for the platform and the company’s efforts to consolidate its presence in the segment.</p>
<p>“By adding their portfolio to our Fusion platform we will significantly enhance our proposition and provide players with a fantastic experience,” Harris explained.</p>
<p>Kiron and Pariplay Welcome the Opportunity</p>
<p>The partnership was also welcomed by Kiron co-CEO Steven Spartinos who said that the aim of his company’s games was to reach as wide an audience as possible – something that is now very likely to happen thanks to Pariplay’s advanced infrastructure.</p>
<p>“Their presence in key regulated markets will be crucial for us as we continue to grow, and we are excited to offer our innovative and premium products to their extensive operator network,” Spartinos said.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been actively looking to expand its market footprint. The company recently introduced Skillzzgaming content to BetMGM via its Fusion platform. Digital growth in the United States has been somewhat of a priority with Pariplay also expanding in New Jersey through a Resorts Digital Gaming link-up.</p>
