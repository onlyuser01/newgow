<p>Land-based gross gaming revenue (GGR) in Atlantic City totaled $177.2 million, a 9.2 percent increase compared to the same month in 2018. Internet casinos won $33.6 million, a 53 percent surge, and sportsbooks kept $18.77 million in bets.</p>
<p>New Jersey gaming income was $45.3 million more in January 2019 compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>Atlantic City held its own in January, a month when gaming figures have traditionally dropped off,” New Jersey Casino Control Commission Chairman James Plousis told the Press of Atlantic City. “The figures seem to be a good first chapter for Atlantic City’s 2019 gaming story.”</p>
<p>Atlantic City casinos won $2.85 billion last year, the market’s best number since 2013.</p>
<p>Dissecting Revenue Report</p>
<p>The headline that GGR is up almost 25 percent in New Jersey reads well. However, not everything is as it appears.</p>
<p>The financial filing from the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) shows that January was a cold month for Atlantic City casinos’ land-based operations. Borgata, the top revenue earner, saw its win decrease six percent to $53.6 million.</p>
<p>Bally’s fell five percent, Harrah’s 8.6 percent, and Golden Nugget 9.6 percent. The biggest loser was Caesars, which saw GGR plummet 21.3 percent to $17.1 million, a loss of more than $4.6 million.</p>
<p>Only Resorts recorded a land-based gaming revenue win – up 8.8 percent to $12.6 million.</p>
<p>The total land-based revenue increase of course comes from the introductions of Hard Rock and Ocean Resort. The Boardwalk properties respectively generated $15.5 million and $12.3 million in casino win.</p>
<p>The addition of sports betting – which also wasn’t in operation in January 2018 but was last month – delivered an additional $9.7 million to Atlantic City casinos. Sportsbooks at Meadowlands ($7 million) and Monmouth Park ($2 million) helped the overall New Jersey gaming revenue picture.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Expansion</p>
<p>New Jersey is one of the seven states that has joined Nevada in allowing full-scale sports betting. And handle – aka total bets placed – continues to grow in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers printed $385.28 million worth of ticket slips last month, the state’s all-time best since the activity went live last June. Resorts and its mobile partner DraftKings reported the largest sports betting win, with revenue coming in at nearly $6.9 million. Ocean Resort’s William Hill sportsbook was next at $1.2 million.</p>
<p>All nine Atlantic City casinos have land-based sportsbooks, as does the Monmouth and Meadowlands horse racetracks. Numerous mobile betting platforms are additionally up and running.</p>
<p>The $18.77 million win comes before New Jersey sportsbooks suffered a loss during Super Bowl 53 earlier this month. The DGE said oddsmakers took $34.89 million in bets, but paid out $39.46 million after heavy action on the winning New England Patriots.</p>
<p>DraftKings spun the statewide loss by saying, “If our customers are winning, we’re winning.”</p>
