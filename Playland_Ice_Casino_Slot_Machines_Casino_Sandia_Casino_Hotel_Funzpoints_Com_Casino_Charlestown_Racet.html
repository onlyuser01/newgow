    <h1>Playland Ice Casino Slot Machines Casino Sandia Casino Hotel Funzpoints Com Casino Charlestown Racet</h1>

<p>I made an entirely fresh and new account to this site. I deposited 25eur with an -first- welcome bonus. I won with welcome bonus 602eur winning and tried to make an withdrawal after I met the wagering requirements. Right after that they first locked my account and soon later they locked entire finnish region. I played before any restrictions, just to be clear. I asked for the reason from livechat, and they aswered there's an ongoing fraud investigation, which is okay I guess. They cleared that my account was ok, and asked me to send verification documents to their email and I thought that everything is okay, as they said I'm in good standing with them (as seen in livechat). I sent them verification documents and after that I didn't heard anything from them for weeks. Today I tried to take contact via livechat again to ask what's the situtation over there and now they said that I was only claiming this bonus to withdraw money and they will void my winnings. So I met wagering requirements and after that they said that this isnt okay for some reason, and was accusing me in someway of systematic bonus abuse. With my first deposit and bonus in the whole site.. Im not sure if they added that part to T&amp;C-pages right after my withdrawal. Why there is wagering requirements if I can't freely decide what to do after I have met them requirements?</p>
<p>I will be happy enough if I will receive my FIRST withdrawal (602eur) as I didn't do anything wrong. It was my first time at the site, made my first deposit, I met the wagering requirements and wanted to withdraw my winnings. Simple as that.</p>
<p>I will not be happy if they decide to void this for some reason I didn't do.</p>
