<p>The leading iLottery and iGaming content and solutions provider, NeoGames, announced that its subsidiary, Pariplay, inked a major deal with the Swedish Horse Racing Totalizator Board, ATG. The collaboration was announced Monday and sees Pariplay significantly expand its presence in the country.</p>
<p>The strategic distribution agreement will see ATG tap into Pariplay's aggregation platform called Fusion. This will allow the operator to gain access to a leading portfolio of content including Wizard Games titles, among other popular third-party content offered by Pariplay. What's more, ATG will gain access to top-performing games such as 12 Super Hot Diamonds Extreme, Jade King, Spirit of Mustang and Dragons of the North, to name a few.</p>
<p>Currently, Pariplay's fusion platform offers a growing portfolio of more than 14,000 games from more than 80 different content providers. Thanks to the recent agreement, ATG will also access a set of leading player retention and conversion tools from Pariplay.</p>
<p>In a statement released on October 3, 2022, Maria Allm√©r, ATG's Head of Casino, commented: "Our promise is to offer exciting gaming experiences in a responsible and smooth way to our customers." She explained that the new collaboration with Pariplay will further boost this strategy while at the same time introducing a leading product portfolio for customers in Sweden.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Pariplay's new partnership with ATG marks a monumental moment for the company in Sweden. This is because ATG currently holds approximately 30% of the share of the licensed market in the country, most out of any operator with a Swedish license. The significant market share represents a continuously growing customer base. In fact, ATG had a customer base of some 1.3 million players at the end of last year. With that in mind, the leading content portfolio offered by Pariplay will likely help expand ATG's player base even further.</p>
<p>Moti Malul, NeoGames' Chief Executive Officer, acknowledged that ATG is already a brand that is highly popular and well-established in Sweden. He pointed out that the brand also has a rich history. In conclusion, Malul said: "Since launching their online casino, it has gone from strength to strength, and we are thrilled to support their continuous growth with our premium content that resonates well with a wide player demographic."</p>
<p>Besides expanding in a key market such as the one in Sweden, Pariplay continues to grow on a global scale. Last month, the company grew its Latin American footprint after entering the regulated iGaming market in Panama. The entry came after approval by the gambling regulator that enabled Pariplay to supply its leading products for clients in the market.</p>
