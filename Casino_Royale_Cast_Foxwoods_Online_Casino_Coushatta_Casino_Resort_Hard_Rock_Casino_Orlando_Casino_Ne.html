    <h1>Casino Royale Cast Foxwoods Online Casino Coushatta Casino Resort Hard Rock Casino Orlando Casino Ne</h1>

<p>Brazino was the first online casino I played and I do not recommend it to anyone, especially Curaçao Casinos. Unfortunately we were deceived. My wife and I, from individual accounts, and without much instruction, deposited exorbitant amounts on this site. The casino did make some deposits into our accounts, but at the end of the day we were left with nothing, because even after asking for the account to be deleted, we were induced, through several emails, to deposit more and more. We were left with negative personal accounts of over 150,000 BRL, and that's when the trouble started.</p>
<p>It was like this, I won something, asked for the account to be closed, and then the casino insistently sent new emails asking us to deposit, then open the account again.</p>
<p>We were deliberately seduced by the insistent advertising of this casino and we were left in a dire situation.</p>
<p>We made an Out of Court claim at the casino, and I was accused with my wife of having multiple accounts. We inform the staff of Casino Brazino that, as the activity is illegal in Brazil, it is because we were incisively harassed, the correct thing was to return our money or enter into a partial return agreement. But the casino ignored this entire situation and did not even offer a proposal to end the dispute.</p>
<p>We appointed a lawyer and filed a diplomatic representation at the embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and at the Government of Curaçao, but these things take time, it has been almost a year and no solution has been given.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we were victims and we asked for help and understanding from the casino, and he ignored it. They really ignore it. After we found out that casino gambling is illegal here, we went after our rights, but they made fun of us.</p>
<p>We have a handicapped son with Autism, and because of the easy-to-earn offer offered by Brazino in videos on YouTube, etc., we spent our entire reserve on treatment. Today we can't go on. There are Brazino advertisements everywhere in Brazil. They take everything and don't care where the money is coming from. They didn't mind consuming large sums of money from two workers without worrying about the source of the money.</p>
<p>We asked Casino Guru for help, because as the investigation with the lawyer runs in secrecy of justice, people cannot know about the evils of this casino. Only here at casino guru can people be alerted. We help casino guru.</p>
