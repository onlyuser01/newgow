    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Hotel Robert De Niro Casino Hooters Casino Western Village Inn Casino River Rock Ca</h1>

<p>Evolution has signed a new collaboration with Betway’s Super Group, which will allow the supplier to provide and launch its entire portfolio of live casino and first-person RNG-based casino games in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the United States. This comes only two months after Betway introduced its sports and casino product in New Jersey. The move was preceded by a Pennsylvania launch in June.</p>
<p>Evolution Brings Its First-Person Games to Betway</p>
<p>The move marks another significant expansion of Evolution’s footprint in existing markets and builds on the successful relationship between Betway and the company over the last years. Betway has been present in the United States thanks to an exclusive partnership with Digital Gaming Corporation (DGC).</p>
<p>Moving forward, Betway will have access to numerous spot-on live games by Evolution, including the First Person RNG-casino suite, which is one of the focal points of the experience. Combining live gaming with the quickness of a random number generator, Evolution is able to bring more classics to players in the exact shape and form they want them in.</p>
<p>The selection includes a variety of games, such as Poker, Baccarat, Blackjack, and Roulette, as well as a variety of platforms, name desktop, tablet, and smartphone. This will further strengthen Betway’s offering in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where the company is already up and running and offering a selection of dedicated slot titles.</p>
<p>North American Plays a Key Role for Betway</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Evolution NA commercial director Jeff Millar had this to add: “Our US rollout continues at pace and, once again, we are delighted to be working with a brand with which we have already built an extremely strong and close relationship in other markets. We very much look forward to helping Betway achieve major success in these first two states and in other states in the future.”</p>
<p>The news was welcome by Betway CEO Anthony Werkman, who argued that consumers in the Garden State and Keystone State would now be able to enjoy world-class online casino games powered by Evolution from their homes, and on the go. Werkman was confident that thanks to the already established relationship between the companies, player bases stood to benefit even more.</p>
<p>Evolution has been growing its footprint considerably with live games launching in Michigan as well amid a strong second-quarter for the company. Pennsylvania and New Jersey remain the two most developed and highest-grossing states when it comes to interactive gambling and betting.</p>
