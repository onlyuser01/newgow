    <h1>Gila River Casino Evolution Casino Laughlin Casino Jumer S Hotel Casino Jerry Nugget Casino Blizz Ca</h1>

<p>i am a new player to blizz after depositing and betting i won some money when i asked to withdraw they locked my account and took all my money gave me something ridiculous that I didn't know anything about</p>
<p>Here is what they emailed me:</p>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>We have been made aware by our colleagues at Evolution that when playing on Blizz, you were taking part in what is known as ‘opposite betting’ with a player from another brand on the Evolution network whilst playing Baccarat.</p>
<p>We do not allow this as it gives players an unfair advantage and can also point to other factors such as potential money laundering. After discussion with our partners on the play that took place, we have made the unanimous decision to close your account and confiscate winnings.</p>
<p>Please see the following from the terms and conditions which you agreed to on sign up: 9.1. Criminal Activity In the case when any irregularity (including a suspicion of attempted money-laundering or fraud) has been noticed, blizz.io reserves the right to close Accounts and/or report about criminal or other suspicious activities provided through one or multi Accounts to the relevant existing regulatory or law enforcement authorities. All offenders’ Account balances will be blocked, withdrawals will be void, deposits and winnings will be forfeited.</p>
<p>Please rest assured we do not take decisions such as this lightly but in this case we believe we had no other option when our partners at Evolution bought this to our attention.</p>
<p>This decision is final and no further correspondence regarding it will be entered into.</p>
<p>Best regard</p>
<p>Blizz team</p>
