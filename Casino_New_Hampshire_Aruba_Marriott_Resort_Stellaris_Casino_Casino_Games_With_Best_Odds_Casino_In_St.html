    <h1>Casino New Hampshire Aruba Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino Casino Games With Best Odds Casino In St</h1>

<p>Hello, due to a daily limit of €500, following a win, I requested 3 withdrawals of €500 each on 3 different days.</p>
<p>The first withdrawal went through smoothly. On 4/12/2023, this withdrawal was credited to my bank account. The second withdrawal, which initially appeared as pending (with the possibility of cancellation), was handled (I received an email confirming this). The third withdrawal, as it was still pending, I cancelled and replayed the amount of €500. At the time of cancellation, I had 16.26€ in my account, which added to the 500, made a total of 516.26€ as I can show. This casino, however, claims that I cancelled two withdrawals of €500 instead of a single one. Indeed, in the account transactions, two cancellation entries appear, one with the description Creditcard and the other bankaccount, approximately 20 seconds apart, each with an identical total of €516.23, proving that it actually was a single withdrawal, because if there were two withdrawals the second entry would've been €1016.23 instead of €516.23€. I've written several times to support and in all cases, they have replied that I cancelled the withdrawals. However, in their email dated 4/12/2023, it stated that the withdrawal was being processed. Please help me recover this amount of €500. I have all the transactions that prove this is the truth.</p>
<p>The casino claims that they have completed my due withdrawals and according to them it was only 500€. They still need to send another 500€, as proven by the last attachment regarding the withdrawal being processed (in this case the second withdrawal).</p>
