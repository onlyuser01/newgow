<p>Entain has supported the charity for over six years now and intends to continue providing it with the help it needs</p>
<p>Entain’s non-profit arm, the Entain Foundation, has announced that it has agreed to provide funding for the Alumni Project of Gordon Moody, a British problem gambling treatment charity.</p>
<p>The project in question is a two-year program that seeks to establish a network of ex-gambling addicts who have overcome their addiction thanks to Gordon Moody. They will serve as peer mentors who help others who are either currently struggling with problem gambling or have just finished treatment.</p>
<p>The Alumni Project’s main task is to help more people get their gambling habits under control, thus preventing addiction, financial destitution and gambling-related crime. The alumni will be provided with a number of flexible part-time and full-time paid positions. They will not only be tasked with helping others but with providing feedback to improve the treatment programs as well.</p>
<p>The Alumni Project will formally kick off in April and will be overseen by Gordon Moody’s Head of Service Development, Clinical Director and the members of its Clinical Governance Committee.</p>
<p>The initiative’s cost for the initial two-year term will be around £740,000 (around $908,000). According to the current announcement, the Entain Foundation will entirely fund the program.</p>
<p>This would not be the first time Entain has supported Gordon Moody either. The gambling giant has been providing the charity with financial donations and a range of other resources for more than six years. Some of the projects Entain supported include the development of Gordon Moody’s Gambling Therapy application, its COVID-19 pandemic services and a women’s residential program.</p>
<p>Entain has also promoted Gordon Moody’s services in its shops.</p>
<p>Entain Remains Committed to Supporting the Charity</p>
<p>Matthew Hickey, Gordon Moody’s chief executive officer, commented on the Alumni Project, saying that it will leverage “the voice of lived experience” to help more people struggling with problem gambling. He thanked Entain for its continuous commitment:</p>
<p>Support from the Entain Foundation is crucial to help Gordon Moody grow its services and meet the demands of those needing treatment and support. We are delighted to continue our work with Entain and for their ongoing support and financial donations. Matthew Hickey, CEO, Gordon Moody</p>
<p>Barry Gibson, Entain’s chairman, also voiced his thoughts. He said that his company is happy to support Gordon Moody and is glad to provide it with the funding it needs for the Alumni Project.</p>
<p>This is in addition to the more than £40 million we have voluntarily donated to GambleAware, who commission treatments for gambling addiction across England, Scotland and Wales, free at the point of delivery. Barry Gibson, chair, Entain</p>
<p>Gibson concluded that the Alumni Project will be an unprecedented initiative where those who have completed their treatment will be able to help others.</p>
