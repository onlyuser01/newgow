    <h1>Parkwest Casino Lodi Free Casino Games With Free Coins Ignition Casino Poker Raging Bull Casino 100</h1>

<p>Casino game developer Red Rake Gaming announced a new agreement with operator Meridianbet. The mutually beneficial collaboration will bolster Meridianbet with Red Rake’s complete portfolio of titles while simultaneously giving the technology company access to new markets worldwide.</p>
<p>Meridianbet Gains Top-Performing Games</p>
<p>Red Rake Gaming announced the new agreement via a press release on its official website. The Span and Malta-based company will use its rich portfolio of titles to boost Meridianbet’s international expansion efforts.</p>
<p>The casino and sports betting operator has a substantial presence in the Balkans and is actively working towards expanding its reach in Africa and Latin America. Cooperating with Red Rake means that even more players will be able to enjoy some of the developer’s hugely successful titles, such as Tiki Goddess, Vikings Journey, Lucky Adam, and Super 25 Stars.</p>
<p>Red Rake Malta managing director Nick Barr commented favorably on the new partnership, emphasizing the game developer’s continued commitment to producing popular and profitable titles.</p>
<p>Red Rake Gaming is very focused on delivering localized content for any market across the globe… to ensure we have a top performing offering for all our clients. Nick Barr, managing director at Red Rake Malta</p>
<p>Barr also lauded Meridianbet for maintaining its position as a leading operator and expressed confidence that the collaboration would help boost its international growth. Considering Meridianbet’s impressive global reach, the partnership will test Red Rake’s self-proclaimed flexible and client-focused approach.</p>
<p>Red Rake Bolsters Its International Presence</p>
<p>Overall, Red Rake’s recent expansion-focused mindset indicates that things are going well for the developer. The company has been active for 15 years and boasts that its titles feature some of the highest retention and acquisition rates compared to its competitors. Thanks to the newest collaboration, the developer gains access to 35 countries on four continents via a time-tested and successful partner.</p>
<p>The deal with Meridianbet marks the second high-profile partnership for Red Rake in 2022. In June, the casino developer made a similar agreement with gaming and betting solutions provider Octavian Lab, boosting both companies’ presence in the Italian market. Although Europe remains a cornerstone region, Red Rake is confident its products can be viable worldwide.</p>
