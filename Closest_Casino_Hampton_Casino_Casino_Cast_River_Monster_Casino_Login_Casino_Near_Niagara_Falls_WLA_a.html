<p>World Lottery Association (WLA) has awarded its Safer Gambling certification to EveryMatrix, a leading iGaming supplier, which now joins a select club of companies to have been awarded the important distinction.</p>
<p>To get to this point, EveryMatrix had to undergo robust testing which is WLA’s own quality assurance process. Essentially, the WLA follows a strict and comprehensive list of guiding principles that are designed to safeguard players and are upheld by any entities that have received the certification.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix already includes a Safer Gambling strategy as part of its overall Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitment, which has been a contributing factor in WLA’s decision as well.</p>
<p>WLA CSR Senior Manager Melissa Azam welcomed EveryMatrix joining the list of certified companies and adhere to the clear-cut and important WLA Responsible Gaming Guidelines that are designed to distinguish those companies and suppliers that have a true commitment to player protection and safer gambling.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix CEO Ebbe Groes was similarly happy with the certification and he hailed the work that WLA has done in establishing a safer gambling certification in the first place. It’s a solution that establishes and drives forward the principles of safer gambling.</p>
<p>"We entered this process because we firmly believe that to create and maintain a sustainable and successful industry, we must ensure that all players are protected and given the right options to play safely and responsibly, and all our customers are informed of any risks and the actions needed to mitigate those risks."</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Senior Compliance Counsel &amp; Safer Gambling Co-Ordinator Naomi Koops said that this was an important next and transformative step for the company which is now committed to upholding the WLA principles not just for lotteries, but for all of EveryMatrix’s clients.</p>
<p>Koops added that the company is building a safer gambling culture across the board and ensuring that it leads the way when it comes to consumer protection in any vertical it operates in. WLA has been an important certification to all global leaders in the industry. Other members of the WLA certification list are companies such as Scientific Games which obtained its own certification in January 2022.</p>
<p>Other certified companies include Pollard Banknote Limited, IGT, and Intralot, and the WLA guidelines are constantly adjusted to reflect new challenges and raise consumer protection standards.</p>
