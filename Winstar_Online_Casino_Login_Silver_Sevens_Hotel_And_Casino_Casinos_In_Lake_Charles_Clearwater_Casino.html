<p>Low6 has inked a customer communications partnership with Xtremepush, strengthening its foothold on the market via Xtremepush’s solutions</p>
<p>The business-to-business turnkey online gaming platform has sealed the new agreement with the Omnichannel Customer Engagement Platform as part of its growth plans. Xtremepush helps companies change regular customer experiences into engaging, conversion-driving interactions</p>
<p>Low6 to Promote Relevant Content Games via Highly Personalised Communications</p>
<p>Low6’s chief strategy officer for North America Josh Turk discussed the new partnership with the “sophisticated provider”, explaining that by turning Xtremepush into their customer communications provider, the company will reinforce its presence in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Turk believes the new agreement will give them the opportunity to better understand their database of players at a deeper level and proceed to send them personalized campaigns using a variety of channels. Turk called this a “complete game changer”.</p>
<p>Not wanting to fall behind its competition, the company that powers leagues, sports teams, sportsbooks, and popular brands with customized gaming experiences is currently using Xtremepush’s platform to simultaneously complete multiple projects.</p>
<p>Their main focus falls on sending marketing communications using emails, SMS, and app notifications for promoting the most relevant games and messages. This is accomplished with the help of highly personalized communications solutions.</p>
<p>As a result, players are encouraged to take action and interact with their preferred fantasy sports teams and other games.</p>
<p>Xtremepush: Working with Low6, “an Absolute Pleasure”</p>
<p>Xtremepush’s senior account executive Brandon Asgeirsson called Low6 “a seriously impressive business with a lot of marquee brands under their belt”.</p>
<p>He also described the chance to collaborate with them as an absolute pleasure and also a highly beneficial decision for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Asgeirsson further expressed their optimism concerning the future of this newly-inked partnership, explaining their eagerness to see the bond keep flourishing in the future.</p>
<p>Low6 currently provides its state-of-the-art sports gamification technology to popular franchises, sports leagues, media organizers, big brands in the industry, and important operators.</p>
<p>Basically, the platform works by gamifying global audiences and fueling franchises with their own branded experiences. This helps the latter better engage with their customers and further monetize their online fanbases.</p>
<p>This is done with the help of highly innovative gaming solutions that stimulate the acquisition of first-party data.</p>
<p>Last December, Extremepush signed a better player personalization agreement with iGaming company Checkd Group, helping the latter with enhanced strategies for player acquisition. Similarly, in September, Xtremepush partnered with Kwiff, helping the betting service boost its player outreach strategy.</p>
<p>This week, Low6 appointed Brittany Almeida as its new sales and strategy director in an attempt to help the company’s ongoing growth plans.</p>
