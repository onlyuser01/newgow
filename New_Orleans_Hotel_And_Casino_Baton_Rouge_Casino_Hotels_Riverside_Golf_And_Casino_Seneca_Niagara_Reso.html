<p>Joni M. Thrower Davis and Andrew T. Palms were reappointed to the board with their term set to expire on December 31, 2027</p>
<p>Joni M. Thrower Davis and Andrew T. Palms were reappointed as board members of the gambling regulator in Michigan, the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB), by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Earlier this week, MGCB’s executive director, Henry Williams, confirmed the reappointment of the two.</p>
<p>Initially, Palms was appointed to the MGCB by the now-former Gov. Rick Snyder back in 2012. Considering his reappointment, he enters his 12th year as a member of the board of the gambling regulator. On the other hand, Davis first joined the MGCB as a board member at the start of 2020 after she was selected as the successor of Patrick M. McQueen. The reappointment starts Davis’ second four-year term.</p>
<p>According to the MGCB, the two board members were reappointed for a term that is set to expire on December 31, 2027. Currently, the board of the gambling regulator consists of five members who are residents of the state and are appointed by the Governor. Per the existing rules, one of the members is designated as a chairperson, a role that is currently held by Linda Forte. The recent reappointments reinstated Davis and Palms to the board who join Deidre A. Lambert-Bounds, another board member, while one member spot remains vacant.</p>
<p>The Duo Will Continue to Assist the Regulator</p>
<p>Palms, a Chelsea resident, currently holds a bachelor’s degree of general studies in computer science, business and engineering from the University of Michigan. For more than 30 years, he has worked at the university and currently serves as the executive director of ITS Infrastructure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Davis is a Detroit resident. She holds a Juris Doctor from Emory University School of Law along with a bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan. Davis is currently a managing partner for Jamjomar while at the same time operating and owning four McDonald’s restaurants located in Detroit’s metropolitan area.</p>
<p>“I appreciate Governor Whitmer’s decision to reappoint Joni and Andrew to the Board, which is well-deserved recognition of their dedication, expertise, and valuable contributions to our agency’s mission and vision.“ Henry Williams, executive director of the MGCB</p>
<p>Williams praised Gov. Whitmer’s decision to reappoint both Palms and Davis to MGCB’s board. He recognized their extensive expertise and dedication, making them invaluable assets to the regulator.</p>
<p>Williams predicted that the MGCB’s board will continue to make effective decisions and remain stable, boosted by the duo’s appointments. Finally, he said that the gambling regulator will continue to tackle emerging challenges within the sector across Michigan.</p>
