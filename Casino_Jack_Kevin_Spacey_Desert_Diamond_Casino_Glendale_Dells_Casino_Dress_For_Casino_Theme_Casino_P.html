    <h1>Casino Jack Kevin Spacey Desert Diamond Casino Glendale Dells Casino Dress For Casino Theme Casino P</h1>

<p>I started playing in the casino about half a year ago and verified my account at the beginning. I deposited some money and then withdrawn some money, no problem. I decided it would be my primary casino to play. After another deposit in November, I managed to win around 2,000 euros (which is much less than the previous times). Suddenly, my account (verified) was blocked and I received an email to send photo with a documentmy, payslip and account statement, which I did. Then I was asked for a tax refund .... which is not stated in their regulations if you work normally without being self-employed. I sent them the required documents from TC (payslip, bank statement), unfortunately no contact, they do not respond to the email, I read the reviews about this casino and I am worried that it is a scam, and I would like to get my honestly won money back. Thank you for your help</p>
<p>They replied to my e-mail, they are not interested in my income, but they are interested in why my own father is transferring money to me, they demanded (contrary to EU law on the protection of personal data) my father's ID and his tax declaration, unless they were surprised that they received these documents. They thought I was easily fooled. Of course, I will report this matter to the appropriate authorities in MALTA and the UK because I and my family have such opportunities. It also gives them a chance to get out of it with a face and unlock my account.</p>
<p>Email from them: Thank you for getting in touch and for explaining.</p>
<p>Kindly note that following a review of the documents received we still need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A document showing that you withdrew the wins from Betclic using Paypro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also still need an official document showing your father's income ( we are unable to accept the document sent from your end since this is not an official document)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and a letter explaining why funds were transferred to your account (we are unable to accept the email received since this is not explaining why the transfers were made but is showing copied transactions instead)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I am sure that you are scammers.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have received the most important official document on income from work in Poland.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.You have received official betclick document about witdhrawal, it issues betclick document only upon special request.</p>
<ol>
<li>You never send a transfer letter, or you send a letter to the client accepting a deposit or withdrawal? I sent you an official confirmation of my dad about the transfer amounts and transfer titles that tell about reason, I also sent you screens from the messenger application (you can treat it as a letter) where dad wrote the reason and the amount of the transfer, there is also the date.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am no longer interested in playing in your fraudulent casino, I expect a withdrawal of funds accumulated on the player's account.</p>
