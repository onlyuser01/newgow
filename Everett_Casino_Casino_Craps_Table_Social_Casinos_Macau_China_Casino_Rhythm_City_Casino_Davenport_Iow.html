    <h1>Everett Casino Casino Craps Table Social Casinos Macau China Casino Rhythm City Casino Davenport Iow</h1>

<p>Of course, they also pointed out to me that this is the case. But then there are 2 different bonuses and they should not have been counted together. Because they also change the game behavior as a result. If I only had 50 euros from the start, I would have only played the minimum bet right away. But I immediately got the 20 euros that I won in the free spins in my account - so instead of 50 euros I played for 70 euros and a few cents. So I assumed that both bonuses are one part.</p>
<p>Just as it was presented to me, 2 different bonuses were put together although they are treated separately. So here the casino should have said from the beginning only play one bonus and then activate the other.</p>
<p>It is claimed that at some point I had lost the 50 euros and was up to 20 euros - I have no idea if it's true.</p>
<p>The fact is that I paid for 100% and the free spins and none of it was free. If someone tells me after I go online there, here are 20 free spins that we give you, then I also realize that only a certain amount is paid out .</p>
<p>That's the way it is in every casino and it's understandable, but in the casinos where I've been wrong, it was always bonuses and the winnings from the free spins are combined and then implemented 30, 40, 50, 60 times.</p>
<p>Here you try again to trick a system and completely annoy the player.</p>
<p>I don't know where the problem is, they should add up my bonus and the profit from free play, times the turnover requirements and give me the money back into my account-wouldn't be finished anyway and would have to continue to implement it.</p>
