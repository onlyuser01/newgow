<p>The victim, identified as Andrew Thomas Sutton, 72, suffered leg injuries from a single wound on August 24, according to news reports. The incident occurred when Sutton’s own gun was discharged after he adjusted his pants on the casino floor at the Horseshoe Las Vegas last week.</p>
<p>The incident occurred near the cashier’s cage.</p>
<p>Other casino visitors and security officers rushed over to assist after hearing the gunshot and seeing Sutton fall to the floor.</p>
<p>Sutton formerly worked for the LVMPD, according to Las Vegas TV station KTNV. He retired from his post in 2013.</p>
<p>So far, no charges have been filed against him.</p>
<p>The Horseshoe Las Vegas was formerly Bally’s until a recent rebranding. Caesars Entertainment operates the Las Vegas Strip property.</p>
<p>Recovery Details</p>
<p>Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) officers and an ambulance EMT crew responded to the casino. They also provided initial treatment.</p>
<p>Metro officers investigated the incident and watched the video of the shooting taken by casino surveillance cameras.</p>
<p>He turned away, out of camera view, and … [next he was] physically jumping and then collapsing to the floor,” according to a LVMPD report on the shooting.</p>
<p>Sutton was taken to University Medical Center for emergency treatment. He remained hospitalized and was listed in stable condition earlier this week, according to Las Vegas TV station KSNV. He told a reporter he was “recovering” from his injuries.</p>
<p>Police didn’t release details on the extent of his wound.</p>
<p>Nevada Open Carry Laws</p>
<p>Nevada is an open carry state, meaning citizens are legally allowed to carry a firearm as long as it is on their person, within reach and visible to others. Open carry differed from “concealed carry,” which allows individuals to carry guns not visible to others.</p>
<p>However, a resident must obtain a concealed carry firearm (CCW) permit to carry a concealed weapon, according to LVMPD regulations posted online.</p>
<p>No one else was injured by the gunfire.</p>
<p>The bullet apparently didn’t cause damage to the casino property.</p>
