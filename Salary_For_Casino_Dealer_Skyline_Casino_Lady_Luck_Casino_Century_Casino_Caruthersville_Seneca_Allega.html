<p>Grammy Awards Betting Favorites Win Numerous Categories Including Record and Album of Year</p>

<p>The 61st Grammy Awards had a little something for everyone, and that led to heightened betting interest on who would win the biggest prizes in music.</p>

<p>Unlike last year’s ceremony where men largely dominated, which prompted Recording Academy President Neil Portnow to controversially say women need to “step up,” last night’s Grammy Awards was more split.</p>
<p>Dua Lipa won the award for Best New Artist. She had the second shortest odds at online bookmaker Bovada heading into last night’s event. She was at +180 (implied odds of 35.7 percent), to favorite H.E.R. at -110 (implied odds 52.4 percent).</p>
<p>Lipa took time out of her acceptance speech to throw some shade at Portnow.</p>
<p>So many women! I guess this year we really stepped up,” the 23-year-old declared.</p>
<p>Along with Lipa’s win, females took Best Pop Solo Performance (Lady Gaga “Joanne”), Best Pop Vocal Album (Ariana Grande “Sweetener”), and Best R&amp;B Performance (H.E.R. “Best Part”).</p>
<p>Cardi B also became the first solo woman to win Best Rap Album (“Invasion of Privacy”).</p>
<p>Bettors Get It Right</p>
<p>Lipa’s Best New Artist win didn’t go how oddsmakers and bettors thought, but they correctly picked the two biggest categories of the night.</p>
<p>Bovada had Kacey Musgraves the frontrunner for Album of the Year at +120. The country music singer beat out seven other nominees. As for Record of the Year, “This is America” was the frontrunner at -150. The Childish Gambino track is written by Donald Glover – who is Childish Gambino – along with Ludwig Göransson and Jeffrey Lamar Williams.</p>
<p>Sunday was a big night for Gambino (though he didn’t attend the show). Along with Record of the Year, he also upset favorite Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s “Shallow” for Song of the Year.</p>
<p>It’s the first time in Grammy history that the same rap track has won both Song and Record of the Year.</p>
<p>Oscars Odds</p>
<p>From music to movies, the film industry’s most important awards show will take place February 24. It will be the first Academy Awards to go without a designated host in three decades.</p>
<p>As for Best Picture, “Roma” is the frontrunner at -190. “Green Book” is next at +350, followed by longshots “The Favorite” (+1000), “A Star is Born” (+1600), “BlacKkKlansman,” “Black Panther,” and “Bohemian Rhapsody” (+1800), and finally “Vice” at +6600.</p>
<p>Bohemian Rhapsody’s” Rami Malek is the heavy odds-on favorite for Best Actor at -300. At those odds, you’ll need to wager $300 to net $100. Christian Bale (“Vice”) is second at +200.</p>
<p>Glenn Close (“The Wife”) is an even stronger favorite for Best Actress (-500). Her next closest challenger is Olivia Colman in “The Favorite” (+400).</p>
<p>New Jersey gaming regulators allow Atlantic City casinos and the state’s two horse racetrack sportsbooks to offer odds on Hollywood’s big night.</p>
