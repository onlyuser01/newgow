<p>Pandemic-related restrictions have dragged down the Silver State’s gambling revenue in 2020 to its lowest point since 1996.</p>
<p>All Reported Units Experience Annual Decrease in 2020</p>
<p>Nevada gaming revenue went down 34.6% to $7.87 billion in 2020, hitting its lowest annual total since 1996, as a result of the shutdowns and ongoing restrictions to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Slot machines accounted for over two thirds of the total revenue or $5.42 billion, down 31.7% in annual terms, as players staked $78.61 billion. Players staked $43.84 billion on multi-denomination slots compared to $24.14 billion on penny slots. In terms of revenue, multi-denomination slots brought in about $2.38 billion, down 27.3%, while penny slots contributed with $2.35 billion, down 32.8%.</p>
<p>One dollar slot revenue experienced a 34.3% decrease to $365 million and 25 cent slots declined by 49.1% to $143.7 million.</p>
<p>Players waged $19.09 billion on table games, which turned into $2.46 billion in revenue. Twenty one was the biggest contributor to revenue at $643 million from $4.59 billion in stakes, though this corresponds to a 42.2% decline.</p>
<p>Online Registration for Sports Betting is Not On the Table</p>
<p>Despite the slump in gambling revenue, Nevada has dropped efforts to introduce remote sports betting registrations. One of the reasons why the industry is reluctant to remove in-person requirements is that it depends heavily on land-based operations and introducing such options may eventually have a negative effect on the sector.</p>
<p>Sports betting revenue was another segment to experience an overall decrease. It was down 20.2% to $262.8 million in 2020, with state casinos’ bets amounting to $4.34 billion, 18.4% less than in 2019. In November, players placed $609.6 million in bets with Nevada sportsbooks, a 0.8% decrease from the amount wagered in November last year. In October, sports betting handle stood at $659.2 million or 27.3% higher year-over-year.</p>
<p>This is the first year in which Nevada posts a breakdown of online betting revenue, which totalled $117.6 million.</p>
<p>Football was wagers’ favorite sport, which attracted $1.92 billion in stakes. Sportsbooks reported $172.7 million in revenue, down 40.4% from 2019. Sports betting handle from hockey amounted to $149.8 million or $9.7 million in revenue.</p>
<p>Basketball bets stood at $1.17 billion, the equivalent of $56.3 million in revenue or a 40.4% decrease. Baseball betting revenue plummeted due to the disrupted Major League Baseball (MLB) season, which was the shortest one since 1878. Bets amounted to $518.7 million, while revenue stood at $22.1 million, down 61.3%.</p>
