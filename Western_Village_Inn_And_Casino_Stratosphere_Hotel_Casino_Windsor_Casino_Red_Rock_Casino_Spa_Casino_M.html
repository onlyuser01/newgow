<p>AffPapa has provided fresh details about its upcoming iGaming Club event which will take place as part of the official iGaming NEXT Valletta industry gathering in Malta. The iGaming Club is one of AffPapa’s fastest-developing brands and most recognizable achievements over the past years.</p>
<p>The iGaming Club has been an opportunity for companies to come together, exchange know-how and generally network. AffPapa, which focuses on affiliate businesses, has created a parallel event that brings industry leaders together and creates various social environments in which people from the industry get to know each other better, connect, and discuss mutual business interests and opportunities.</p>
<p>iGaming Club is headed for Valletta on June 21-22 during the official iGaming NEXT event. This may be one of the biggest iGaming Club events to date, with AffPapa sharing in a press release that it expects 800 affiliates and operators to join it. The company is also speaking highly of the "speed dating" format that it helped coined which has been one of the best icebreakers during such events.</p>
<p>AffPapa has confirmed that there will be booth zones where affiliates and operators can come together and discuss the most important factor for the companies – traffic. There will also be exclusive zones to make sure that companies can sit aside and in private and talk about potential business deals once the networking and speed dating formats have hit their mark.</p>
<p>AffPapa CEO Levon Nikoghosyan release a statement in which he commented on the upcoming event in full and its significance:</p>
<p>We are excited to announce iGaming Club Malta, providing a platform for affiliates and operators to connect and explore business opportunities in a dynamic and engaging environment. This year’s event is coming in a full-scale format, with iGaming Club welcoming over 800 attendees. Building on the success of our popular speed dating format, we’ve added even more networking opportunities to make valuable connections in the industry. We can’t wait to bring the iGaming Club to the iGaming NEXT Valletta conference and provide an unparalleled experience for all participants.</p>
<p>The news was also welcomed by iGaming NEXT Co-Founder and Managing Director Pierre Lindh who said that he was excited to partner with AffPapa and see their iconic iGaming Club come to the event.</p>
<p>"We couldn’t be more excited to partner with the cool kids on the affiliate block, AffPapa for what promises to be the most valuable, fun, and exciting summit of the year in the industry, iGaming NEXT: Valletta, with 4000 expected delegates and happenings throughout the entire week. The collaboration between AffPapa and iGaming NEXT is a match made in heaven, bringing together two forward-thinking organizations focused on building bridges and generating business between key stakeholders in the industry. Together, we are stronger and more capable of driving innovation and growth," Pierre concluded.</p>
