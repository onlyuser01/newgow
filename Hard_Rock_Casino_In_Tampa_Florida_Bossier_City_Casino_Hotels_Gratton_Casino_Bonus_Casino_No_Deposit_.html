<p>FanDuel will enhance the sports viewing experience for its mobile consumers</p>
<p>Genius Sports, a leading sports data and technology provider, has expanded its existing agreement with sports betting giant FanDuel. Under the new arrangement, the former company will supply “America’s #1 sportsbook” with its transformative BetVision streaming solution.</p>
<p>BetVision was introduced earlier this year, revolutionizing NFL betting by combining streaming and betting to create immersive wagering experiences. Under the new deal, FanDuel will add BetVision to its premium NFL offering.</p>
<p>Thanks to the integration, FanDuel will enhance the sports viewing experience for its mobile consumers. The addition of BetVision into FanDuel’s sportsbook will allow fans to watch data-packed NFL games without leaving the app.</p>
<p>At the same time, Genius Sports, which continues to serve as the exclusive distributor of NFL Official League Data, will continue to provide FanDuel with access to NFL’s Next Gen Stats data and the official sports wagering data feed.</p>
<p>Genius Sports and FanDuel plan to integrate BetVision’s other key features in the future, including integrated betting odds, in-game betting alerts, data-driven augmentations and the ability to place bets without exiting the video player.</p>
<p>BetVision was originally launched in September, quickly proving itself as a tool that efficiently increases in-game wagers, customer engagement and retention rates. At the same time, BetVision supplies sportsbook customers with unparalleled customization options.</p>
<p>BetVision Will Improve the Fan Experience</p>
<p>Mike Raffensperger, FanDuel’s chief commercial officer, commented on the expanded agreement, saying that his team is always looking for ways to improve the betting experience for fans. According to Raffensperger, the partnership is in line with that goal:</p>
<p>Partnering with Genius will allow us to pair our industry-leading product with access to BetVision to build a seamless live betting experience for fans. Mike Raffensperger, CCO, FanDuel</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mark Locke, Genius Sports’ chief executive officer, expressed his excitement about the tie-up with FanDuel. He said that his team is proud to “lead a new era of sports betting experiences” in the NA region.</p>
<p>With heightened demand for greater personalization and interactivity, BetVision revolutionizes the live betting experience for FanDuel’s customers by helping to drive fan engagement and accelerate the growth of in-game betting. Mark Locke, CEO, Genius Sports</p>
<p>In other news, Genius Sports just published its Q3 results. Confident in its performance, the company raised its FY guidance and now expects revenue of $412.0 million and group adjusted EBITDA of $53.0 million.</p>
