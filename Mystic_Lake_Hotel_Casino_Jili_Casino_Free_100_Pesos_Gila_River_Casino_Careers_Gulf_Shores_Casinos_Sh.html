    <h1>Mystic Lake Hotel Casino Jili Casino Free 100 Pesos Gila River Casino Careers Gulf Shores Casinos Sh</h1>

<p>This casino is indeed a scam. They stole my money, froze my account, and I cannot even log in. To provide more details:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have completed the account verification process, submitting all requested documents, and my account was fully confirmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have deposited hundreds of euros.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have had some winnings. The first withdrawal of 30 euros was successful, but not within 24 hours as advertised.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A second withdrawal of 80 euros, should have been completed within 24 hours, but after two days, the money was not in my bank account. When trying to access my casino account, it displayed a message that it has been frozen for 30 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contacted the live chat; no explanation was provided. They just advised me to email the finance department to get all the answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emailed on November 30th, waited three days with no response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contacted the live chat again, and I was informed that my account is under security review, and they will respond from the finance department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of December 5th, I have received NO response or explanation. And of course no money from my requested withdrawal of 80â‚¬.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Dear Casino Guru, I don't know the criteria you use to rate online casinos, but in this case, my situation should be taken seriously into consideration. I relied on your review, thinking it was a loyal casino, but the experience of the past weeks contradicts that.</p>
<p>I've played at several casinos found through your website, winning thousands of euros, and none has treated me this way. And that's the reason many friends of mine and I trust you so much.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've encountered such a situation, and I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of information from this specific casino, as well as their decision to freeze my account with MY MONEY inside and with no warning.</p>
