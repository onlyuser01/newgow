    <h1>Hardrock Casino Kansas Crossing Casino Hotel Netent Casino Casino Traverse City Norfolk Casino Haiti</h1>

<p>I made a deposit on October 7th, 2021 and played with a bonus. I was able to meet the bonus conditions, so I requested the payout on 10/10/2021.</p>
<p>I have already done the KYC and have been accepted.</p>
<p>The first payout was rejected. When asked why, I was told that there was an error in the system. I should request the payout again. Here, too, the payment was withdrawn. As you can see from the attachment, I made a number of other withdrawals, as these were repeatedly canceled.</p>
<p>The support put me off again and again by e-mail with the information that there was an error in the system.</p>
<p>On October 22nd, 2021 I asked for confirmation that the money had now been paid via Mifinity. This was also sent to me (also attached as evidence).</p>
<p>The casino also wrote me an email: "We are a new casino. We have only been working for a month. Sometimes there may be some technical glitches and we apologize for that.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that you had to wait so long, we want to apologize and the next time you deposit we will give you another 150% bonus. "</p>
<p>But since Mifinity is a real-time money system and I did not receive any money, the support wrote to me on October 22nd, 2010 by email:</p>
<p>"Since we are a new brand, and the payment was on Mifinity, we had to withdraw funds from bank accounts (because at the moment your winnings are the largest) and transfer it to Mifinity, so that they, in turn, would check this money and send it to you. This has been going on for so long due to the fact that the Mifinity account was not so replenished with funds, since we have been working quite recently. From now on, there will be no such situations. And the funds from the bank account have long gone to Mifinity. Therefore, we are now waiting for their verification and after that we immediately send your payout to you. We hope that this will happen today. Please don't worry.</p>
<p>This is the first time we have had such a situation, so it now takes more time than it should. "</p>
<p>I haven't heard from the casino since then. I do not receive any money and I no longer receive an answer to questions.</p>
