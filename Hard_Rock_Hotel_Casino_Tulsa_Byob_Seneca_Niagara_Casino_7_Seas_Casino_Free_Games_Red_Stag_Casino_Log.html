    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Tulsa Byob Seneca Niagara Casino 7 Seas Casino Free Games Red Stag Casino Log</h1>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>I am sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>Dear rayaneg,</p>
<p>Can you please provide us with an update? Is there any progress on your issue?</p>
<p>If you also know the answers to the questions directed to the casino, feel free to answer.</p>
<p>Dear 4raBet Casino team,</p>
<p>Alright, at least we already know that it is about one of the casino's welcome casino bonuses.</p>
<p>Was it the first welcome deposit bonus? Are we talking about one of the deposit bonuses from the "Casino Welcome Pack 700%" from the casino's "Bonuses" section (possible to check HERE)? If yes, were the Terms and Conditions from the "Details" for this bonus applied? If not, were general Bonus Terms applied?</p>
<p>Basically, it is clear what a high RTP game means. To be more specific about high RTP games, I rather asked about the specific games. The player claimed that she wagered it in slots, which is allowed. If she met the wagering requirements, and the bonus funds were converted to a real money balance, why should the bonus rules have still been applied? Are you please able to provide me with the specific games that she played to meet the wagering requirements for the bonus? A high RTP game is quite an uncertain description.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I could not find the relevant rules in the link you provided, except for rule 9.7. Instead, I found these rules in the casino's Bonus Terms:</p>
<p>"1.9. From the bonus account - withdrawal of funds is not available since bonus money from the bonus account flows to the real balance in the event of successful wagering. Until the wagering requirements are met, money from the bonus balance cannot be transferred to the main balance.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Casino Welcome Bonus Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>"13. All restricted games excluded from bonus wagering will be supported with bonus money inaccessibility informational pop-up window with the following proposal to continue playing with your real money balance."</p>
<p>Does that not mean it is impossible to play forbidden games with a bonus? How could she play them? Is it possible to play forbidden games with the bonus after confirming the pop-up, please?</p>
<p>Was there only one deposit bonus used? What was the bonus amount? What should be paid to the player?</p>
<p>As for the bonus "hunting" or bonus abuse, I recommend reading more about our attitude in our Fair Gambling Codex - sections 8 and 9, as well as a separate article dedicated to Banning Betting Patterns.</p>
<p>To be honest, it is very difficult communication if not all questions are answered sufficiently and in detail. Therefore, I will ask you once again for the same that I posted in this thread already 2 months ago.</p>
<p>Can you please substantiate your claims and the casino's decision with the relevant documentation?</p>
<p>Could you share the player's complete game logs and transaction history with me?</p>
<p>It is possible to share the data directly here, with your reply, or by sending them to my email address (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>Please note that at least since the time the casino replied to this thread for the first time, we are stuck at the same point, without any progress, which is more than a month. I am afraid that if there is no further and active cooperation in resolving the matter on your side, we will be forced to close the complaint as unresolved.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
