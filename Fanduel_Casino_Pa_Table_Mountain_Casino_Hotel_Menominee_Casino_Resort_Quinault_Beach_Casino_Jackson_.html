    <h1>Fanduel Casino Pa Table Mountain Casino Hotel Menominee Casino Resort Quinault Beach Casino Jackson</h1>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Sorry, we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>Although we recommend casinos enforce such rules by software or forbid such games while playing with the bonus, we are talking about bonus/free money given by the casino on top of your deposit, and the casino can limit them as it sees fit (unless it is not in conflict with our Fair Gambling Codex). In this case, the casino states bonus rules clearly in its terms and conditions, and those were accepted upon registration. The casino acted within its rules and we accept its decision.</p>
<p>I was provided with sufficient evidence supporting the casino's decision. After gathering all the necessary information we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - the maximum bet amount during playing with the bonus was exceeded. Thanks to the use of features in games where the maximum bet was exceeded, you gained an unfair advantage - the total values of the winnings from these features were counted in the wagering requirements, which in one case was more than 50 times the original bet. This significantly simplified meeting the wagering requirements by the forbidden way. Unfortunately, you are not entitled to the winnings obtained from this bonus.</p>
