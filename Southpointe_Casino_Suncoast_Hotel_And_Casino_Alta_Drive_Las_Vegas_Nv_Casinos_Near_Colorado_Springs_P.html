    <h1>Southpointe Casino Suncoast Hotel And Casino Alta Drive Las Vegas Nv Casinos Near Colorado Springs P</h1>

<p>Dear Player010292,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the General T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"In case you want to be temporary or permanently self-excluded and stop betting or gambling for a set time, please contact our customer support agent via email. On receipt of an email request for account closure, the requested account and any linked accounts will be placed on our first stage, 24-hr cooling off period which will disable your account or accounts, allowing no gambling activity. Once this time has passed; while your account or accounts remain closed, a customer support agent will inform you of the 1-week, 1-month, 6-months and permanent self-exclusion available. There will be no variation in these time periods. To proceed with this process, we will require an email response. If we do not receive a response within a further 24 - hrs, your account will be reopened and confirmed by email."</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that you did not save the self-exclusion request? If that is the case, I am afraid that our options to help a very limited. Could you please advise if you currently have access to your casino account?</p>
<p>Furthermore, we accept the situation when the casino allows players from restricted countries to open an account as long as they don’t use this as an opportunity to later cancel the player’s legitimate winnings. Simply said – if the casino allows players from restricted countries to deposit and play, they should pay out their winnings as well. However, if the player personally chose to make deposits and lost, we believe they are not eligible for any refunds because they could lose their deposits in the same manner at any other casino.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to emphasize, that we investigate further and help only those players, whose funds or winnings have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country. Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem that this is the case here, but correct me if I am wrong, please.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
