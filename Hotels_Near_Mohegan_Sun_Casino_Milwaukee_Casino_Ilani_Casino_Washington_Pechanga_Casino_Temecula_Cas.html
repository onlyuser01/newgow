<p>My complaint is regarding the sportsbook Mybookie and their false accusation of me violating their terms and conditions leading to them wrongfully closing my account with $116,600 in there. On March 11th, Mybookie disabled my account for "security reasons" as stated in the error message when attempting to log in. The first time I spoke with a customer service rep, he told me that they were doing a random routine check on my account for my own security and that this is common so I got nothing to worry about. He then followed up by saying I would be able to access my account in 24-48 hours. So I said okay I understood that it was not going to be a problem. Three days pass and I try to log in, the same message appears, and I call customer service again (3/15/21) and the second rep tells me, "Oh we're doing an investigation on your accounts gameplay and a representative will contact you when the investigation is complete via email."</p>
<p>At this time, I began to worry because I had received two different responses that don't relate to one another:</p>
<p>Response 1 (3/12/21) - They said they were doing a random routine check on my account for my own security and that this is common so I got nothing to worry about and followed up saying I would be able to access my account in 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>Response 2 (3/15/21) - They said, "we're doing an investigation on your accounts gameplay and a representative will contact you when the investigation is complete via email or phone</p>
<p>It took them almost 4 weeks for them to contact me back and when they did they sent me an email stating,</p>
<p>After a full review of your account, we have determined that you discovered a software malfunction in one of our casino games and took advantage of it. As per our Terms and Conditions, we consider these funds to have been generated illegitimately, therefore we will be forfeiting all winnings accrued from that game and keep the account permanently disabled. We ask you to refrain from opening any further accounts. Any new accounts opened by you or for you will be immediately terminated and all funds will be seized. The decision is final and irreversible."</p>
<p>So after receiving this email I contacted Betsoft to see if they were aware of this software malfunction because they are the ones who created the game and I knew Mybookie was lying. So When I contacted Betsoft they stated that this "software malfunction" mybookie is claiming I took advantage of was indeed not the player's fault but indeed a technical issue on their part, regarding their 10 spin structure and 1 of the features in the game.</p>
<p>The feature they are referring to is adjusting your bets. So the game is a 10 spin structure game in which you collect as many robbers as you can in a 10 spin round and after 10 spins the bombs explode, but if a player decides to change their bet amount during the round all the bombs collected in that round will reset and a player restarts and begins a new round.</p>
<p>So after almost 2 years of the game fully operating the game has always included this feature and was always part of the gameplay. Betsoft decided to change its gameplay and change the structure of the spins for some of their games. For 2 years Mybookie had the chance to raise the issue or decide not to have that game on their website but waited until I had a significant amount of money in my account to say something. But instead, they continued to leave the game operating and didn't even give a warning or inform players that this was even an issue. This feature is part of the game so how would a player even know this would be an issue in the first place. Betsofts choice to change their gameplay is not the player's fault but Mybookie is using this as a cover-up to not pay out its players.</p>
