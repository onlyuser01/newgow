<p>Bally’s Races to New High as Analyst Jonas Forecasts Massive Upside</p>

<p>Bally’s Corp. (NYSE:BALY) is on pace for its highest close on record after a sell-side analyst called the gaming company an undervalued play on sports wagering expansion.</p>

<p>In a note to clients Wednesday, Truist analyst Barry Jonas reiterated a “buy” rating on Bally’s while boosting his price target to $80. That implies upside of more than 19 percent from $67, which is almost the all-time high reached earlier today.</p>
<p>While BALY’s shares are up +106 percent since it announced its Sinclair transaction on 11/18/20 (vs. S&amp;P 500 up +9 percent), we believe shares are still undervalued,” said Jonas.</p>
<p>Last November, the Rhode Island-based casino operator said it’s paying $85 million over 10 years to add its name to 21 regional sports networks (RSNs) owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group. That marks the most overt partnership between a sports wagering operator and a media company to date. The broadcast company got a 15 percent equity stake in Bally’s — an asset that’s clearly appreciating. Sinclair has rights to own another 15 percent if certain financial objectives are met.</p>
<p>Through the deal, Bally’s partners with networks that have broadcasting rights for 12 NHL, 16 Major League Baseball (MLB), and 17 NBA franchises.</p>
<p>There’s More, Maybe, for Bally’s Stock</p>
<p>Jonas’s enthusiasm for Bally’s doesn’t end with the $80 forecast. The analyst notes that under an extreme bull case scenario, the shares could reach $150, or more than double where the name trades today.</p>
<p>The analyst adds that the coming full-scale launch of the Bally’s brand across media, digital, and physical platforms should close the valuation discount between the company and rival gaming companies with heavy online footprints.</p>
<p>In the current environment, analysts and investors are smitten by gaming companies with iGaming and sports betting exposure. But Bally’s is still is a land-based casino operator, too. The company runs 15 gaming properties in 11 states when pending purchases close.</p>
<p>On that note, Jonas sees challenges delivered by the coronavirus pandemic turning to tailwinds as more Americans get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Multi-Million Dollar Bids</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Bally’s proposed a $650 million casino in Richmond, Va., joining two other groups in seeking access to Virginia’s capital city.</p>
<p>The company is the highest of the three bidders, and its proposal includes a $100 million upfront payment to the city.</p>
<p>“We are positive on today’s announcement overall, with management entering the competition to try to win the last, and likely most profitable, Virginia casino license,” said Stifel analyst Steven Wieczynski in a note.</p>
<p>That analyst says the $650 million pitch implies adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $78 million to $148 million at the Richmond venue, assuming Bally’s is selected.</p>
<p>That translates to $5 a share. If Bally’s is victorious, it could open the venue in 2024.</p>
