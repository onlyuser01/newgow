<p>Zitro Digital, the online division of land-based slot and game machine developer Zitro, has inked a new content partnership with Codere, a leading iGaming operator. The partnership will see Zitro Digital strengthen its own presence in the Spanish online casino market through the tie-up with Codere Online, which is a prominent operator in the country as well. Both companies are committed to growing their product variety and footprint in the market, hence their most recent alliance, among ongoing efforts to grow in other jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p>Codere.es Now Offers Zitro Digital Titles</p>
<p>Codere.es now offers a range of Zitro Digital games which have been successfully integrated with the platform. Among those are games such as Link King, Link Me, and a variety of bingo games available in Zitro’s library. The Zitro Digital products are built in an engaging and accessible way that makes it easy for local players to explore them in full and enjoy immersive gameplay and rewards.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Zitro Digital COO José Javier Martí welcomed the opportunity to be launching with Codere Online and ensure that the company’s own offer enhances the operator’s existing iGaming infrastructure in Spain:</p>
<p>This new partnership significantly increases the reach of our content in Spain, and we couldn’t be more excited to launch our proven-performance games on the online platform of one of the most renowned casino brands. Zitro Digital COO José Javier Martí</p>
<p>Spain Remains an Important Focal Point of Growth</p>
<p>Codere Online country manager for Spain, Juan Heredero, said that the company was equally pleased with the opportunity to bolster its content portfolio and help bring more worthwhile and innovative content to its players. As such, the company was definitely happy to partner with Zitro Digital, and enrich the existing product library with more memorable options for local consumers.</p>
<p>Zitro has been well-represented locally with the company launching its cabinets with land-based properties in the country. The company’s digital focus has been part of its long-term sustainability strategy and attempts to remain resilient to sudden shocks in the retail gaming market.</p>
