    <h1>Bonusblitz Casino Online Casino Free Play No Deposit Casino Map Casinos In St Louis Mo Sunscape Cura</h1>

<p>The casino was giving a lot of problems that morning, in my case I had to open two incidents, one was returned to me (acknowledging that there were technical failures) and another for a larger amount they said no because the amount of the bet was returned to me. I have proof that the bet entered and later they canceled it supposedly due to a failure on my server. Curiously, the number was repeated, I won it the first time (360 euros), I kept the bet and "I suffered the cancellation" and the following number also entered without problems. But it is also that they are so clumsy that they have sent me an email with all the data of the play, so if they have that information it is because the bet was made effective and it was not a server failure. The fact is that they consider that they do not have to pay me the money because at the time it was canceled they returned the amount of the bet, which is a full-blown scam. If I could choose to cancel the bets when I see that I don't win anything... well, another rooster would crow. The same with the winnings of the players. If every time they are losing money they allege a failure of your server or they kick you out of the table... Well, it should be a crime.</p>
<p>I provide here the evidence of everything I am telling you:</p>
