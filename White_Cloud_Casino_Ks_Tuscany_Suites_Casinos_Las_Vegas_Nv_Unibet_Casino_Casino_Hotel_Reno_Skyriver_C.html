<p>The provider of engaging and quality games for the iGaming vertical, Pragmatic Play, expanded its portfolio of games with the addition of a new slot title. On Thursday, the company announced the release of Starlight Princess 1000, a new addition to its growing portfolio of games. The new 5x6 grid slot game offers engaging and rewarding features, including Scatter, Multipliers and the fan-favorite tumble feature, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Starlight Princess 1000 supports a wide range of languages as well as nearly two dozen different currencies. The latest slot game from Pragmatic Play features an RTP of 96.50%, offers quality animations and vibrant colors.</p>
<p>The game incorporates different gem symbols while the reel is presented at the center of the screen. With that in mind, the Starlight Princess herself can be seen on the right side of the reel. Pragmatic Play's high volatility slot uses the fan-favorite scatter pays mechanic and offers a maximum win of a staggering 15,000x.</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, commented on the release of the new slot game. "Our Starlight Princess saga has seen incredible success and Starlight Princess 1000 is set to continue that with plenty of exciting new features for players to discover," she explained. Finally, Cornides outlined: "The addition of a 1,000x multiplier boosts winning chances to new heights, complemented by an action-packed bonus round that weâ€™re sure fans of the original will embrace."</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play's Starlight Princess 1000 reaffirms the company's dedication to growing its fan-favorite franchise. Keeping users constantly engaged, the leading iGaming content provider previously released Twilight Princess, as well as Big Bass Hold &amp; Spinner Megaways, among other hit titles.</p>
<p>Players of Starlight Princess 1000 can expect an exhilarating gameplay that is full of engaging features. The new slot game from Pragmatic Play offers the fan-favorite tumble feature that removes the winning cluster combination from the reels. Once those symbols are removed, new symbols fall in their place, granting a chance for multiple wins on each spin. Moreover, the game doesn't feature a limit on the tumble feature, meaning that lucky players have a chance to collect mouth-watering prizes from a single spin.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game brings Multiplier symbols that can land on any spin, boosting the win of the players between 2x and the staggering 1,000x. Similar to other games from Pragmatic Play, Starlight Princess 1000 offers free spins. Players who land four or more scatters can trigger special free spins round where they have a chance for big prizes.</p>
