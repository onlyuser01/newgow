    <h1>Mohegan Sun Casino Ct Snoqualmie Casino Hotel Live Dealer Casino Hotels Near Hard Rock Casino Gary I</h1>

<p>I had redeemed a free 20 euro voucher. the requirement was to get 35x stakes.</p>
<p>Miraculously I did it too. Condition: max 50 euro bonus payment</p>
<p>Of course wanted to be paid.</p>
<p>Problem: it first had to be paid in 50 euros to create the prerequisite. So a total of 100 euros payout.</p>
<p>I went through the full identification procedure. Have it confirmed by phone and fill out all forms and passport details etc. The procedure took almost 3 weeks because I made mistakes in the forms written in English and you only get an answer every second working day.</p>
<p>The insolence to 10 was that I should confirm to the casino by email that they had all entered my data correctly. This simple mail with the only sentence "yes everything is correct" also took 4 working days (mind working days in Australia)</p>
<p>Today I finally got the ok that I can make withdrawals.</p>
<p>And that is min. as difficult as identifying. You have to enter everything manually. Iban swift even asked for the address of my bank.</p>
<p>And now the best: transfers only start at 160 euros.</p>
<p>Bitcoin payments from 100 euros</p>
<p>But I don't have a Bitcoina account or wallet</p>
<p>So I can't withdraw any money even after 3 weeks. Neither my 50 paid myself nor the entire 100.</p>
<p>And I can not pay 60 euros because the maximum payment amount is 100 euros and 160 euros would be too much. Everything above 100 is set to zero.</p>
<p>4 hours of arduous support chat brought nothing. the support didn't understand what I wanted and in the end referred me to their "financial department".</p>
<p>I guess I will get an answer in 4 working days.</p>
<p>This casino is the last criminal club. In 15 years of online gaming I have never seen a gang of scammers like this. Stay away from Australian casinos. The support is medieval and cheeky and as a customer just a slap in the face</p>
