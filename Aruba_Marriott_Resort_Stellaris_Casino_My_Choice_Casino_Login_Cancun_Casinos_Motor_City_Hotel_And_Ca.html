    <h1>Aruba Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino My Choice Casino Login Cancun Casinos Motor City Hotel And Ca</h1>

<p>Dear casino guru.</p>
<p>I made a deposit to Fight Club Casino on December 8th using a credit card and Payz, and after playing, I applied for a withdrawal.</p>
<p>The next day, December 9th, I was requested to provide the past month's credit card statement as a required document, and I submitted it to the casino.</p>
<p>Then, on December 15th, the casino informed me that I could not withdraw money unless I multiplied the deposit amount x 3, so I applied for a withdrawal again after multiplying the deposit amount x 3.</p>
<p>However, a few days later, my account was closed for no reason and I received an email from the casino informing me that my balance would be refunded.</p>
<p>I requested a refund using the Payz ID that I used to make the deposit, and the casino accepted, but two weeks have passed and I still haven't received the money.</p>
<p>I have contacted the casino many times via live chat, but the only reply I get is a copy-paste response that says, "We will do it as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The amount deposited is approximately $9,000 and the amount requested for withdrawal is approximately $5,500.</p>
<p>I haven't used any bonuses etc.</p>
<p>Hope that casino guru time will help to resolve this matter.</p>
<p>Thanx in advance!</p>
