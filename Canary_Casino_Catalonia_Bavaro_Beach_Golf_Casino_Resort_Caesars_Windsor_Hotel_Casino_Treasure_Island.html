<p>Almost instantly after Gates of Olympus™ was released in February 2021, it became a go-to slot among streamers. Since then, it has gone from strength-to-strength, and it has been impressive to follow its performance over time. We would like the opportunity to congratulate Pragmatic Play on the success of Gates of Olympus for winning both the “Most Watched” and “Most Streamed Slot of the Month”.
