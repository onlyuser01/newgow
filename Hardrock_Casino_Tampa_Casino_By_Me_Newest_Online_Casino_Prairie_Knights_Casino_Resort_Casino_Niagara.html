<p>Esports betting company GG.BET continues to reinforce its presence in the world of competitive video gaming after the company became the first official sponsor to a regional qualifier for The International, Dota 2’s largest competition featuring millions’ worth prize purses. As part of the company’s expansion in the vertical, GG.BET has signed a partnership with Dota 2 commentator and analyst Andrew “Jenkins” Jenkins who will collaborate with the company to create original content and Twitch broadcasts.</p>
<p>Jenkins Takes You for a Bit of Fun</p>
<p>Jenkins, who is known in the community as the funniest “8K MMR content” creator, has a strong pull with the Dota 2 community, something GG.BET is looking to capitalize on. As an ambassador, he will host various competitions and host show matches, bringing together a number of teams. Viewers will have the opportunity to enjoy exclusive offers from GG.BET.</p>
<p>GG.BET is drastically increasing its presence in Dota 2, with the company looking forward to the release of the Secret Immortal show which is being released after the upcoming TI Regional Qualifier on September 19 and is backed by the betting agency. Jenkins welcomed his own appointment as a brand ambassador and said:</p>
<p>I’m delighted to be an ambassador for a brand that puts so much effort into the growth of esports. GG.BET and I have a lot in common: a genuine love for Dota 2, a desire to create high-quality content, and a huge audience of esports fans. GG.BET brand ambassador Andrew “Jenkins” Jenkins</p>
<p>Jenkins remained confident that he will collaborate with GG.BET to the ultimate benefit of audiences. There will be a lot going on in the months to come, Jenkins promised, with people getting together to play Dota 2, sipping on diet soda, and generally enjoying excellent events across the board. Jenkins’ YouTube and Twitch channels have a combined subscriber count of 350,000.</p>
<p>Dota 2 is one of the most watched esports on a regular basis that pulls significant audiences. Last year’s event pulled in 2.7 million viewers. This is still far below the 112.3 million who watched Super Bowl LVI, but still an impressive number, nevertheless.</p>
