    <h1>Quilceda Casino Big Dollar Casino Casino Cake Ideas Casino Beach Florida Silver Oak Casino No Deposi</h1>

<p>More than 4 months ago I entered this casino because of the wide variety of games and promotions it offers. I used the welcome bonuses and made several deposits which were accepted quickly and I had a great time playing.</p>
<p>When I finished my welcome bonuses, I continued to deposit very enthusiastic about this fun casino, and without being successful in winning, I made a last deposit of 250 euros that was kept as a cash balance and with which I was very lucky to win a super prize from 1700 Euros. Happy with the profit, I made the withdrawal of this amount, understanding the delays that are generated with a first withdrawal. And after they verified all the documents they asked to send, time passed and there was no indication from MagikCasino to approve or give information about my withdrawal.</p>
<p>A month of this went by and bored I canceled this withdrawal to make a smaller one, thinking that the delay would be for the amount withdrawn. By making a lower withdrawal and only half of my earnings, I proceeded to wait for the business days they deliver for the review of each withdrawal. But again the same situation, I did not get approval or a response from the Online Chat.</p>
<p>Every time I spoke with the chat operators, they told me that they could not give out information about the withdrawals and that I should see it with a finance manager by email. Situation that over time was very annoying, since NONE of the more than 10 emails sent were acknowledged, much less answered.</p>
<p>Today I have already lost patience, throughout these 4 months trying to withdraw my profits. The responses from the chat operators have been the same, following a deposit of 250 euros that was kept as a cash balance and with which I was very lucky to win a super prize of 1700 euros. Happy with the profit, I made the withdrawal of this amount, understanding the delays that are generated with a first withdrawal. And after they verified all the documents that they asked me to send them, time passed and there was no indication from MagikCasino to approve or give information about my withdrawal.</p>

<p>Today I have already lost patience, throughout these 4 months trying to withdraw my profits. The responses of the chat operators have been the same, they also continue not to respond to my emails that I send asking for an explanation or deadline for the payment of my winnings that they themselves at one point affirmed that I could withdraw in full.</p>
<p>I just want this to be fixed as soon as possible and thus not reverse the view that MagikCasino is not a trustworthy casino where they do not pay winnings to their players.</p>
