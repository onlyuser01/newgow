<p>Wind Creek Hospitality, the gaming arm of Poarch Band of Creek Indians, has purchased online gaming company FlowPlay. The Seattle-based developer, operator and publisher offers free-to-play and online mobile games, including virtual worlds, sports betting and social casino games. It’s behind popular titles such as Vegas World, Casino World and 7 Seas Casino games.</p>
<p>Poarch Band Extends Online Gaming Reach</p>
<p>The Poarch Band is Alabama’s only federally-recognized Native Indian tribe. It operates three Wind Creek casinos resorts in Alabama, as well as four other properties, located in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Aruba. A location in Illinois is currently under development. It also runs racetracks in Alabama, Florida and other states. Poarch Band of Creek Indians CEO Stephanie A. Bryan stated in a press release:</p>
<p>“The acquisition of FlowPlay into the PCI Gaming portfolio allows us to build opportunities and economic development in new ways, and this provides for our continued growth. We look forward to expanding into this exciting digital space.” Poarch Band of Creek Indians CEO Stephanie A. Bryan</p>
<p>Both companies released a separate statement saying that Wind Creek expected the deal to provide the tribe with proven digital gambling operations and distribution outlets that generate recurring revenues from users using a freemium gaming model. This will increase Wind Creek’s diversity and allow its business to expand customer reach beyond its existing target markets of land-based casinos.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the pandemic, FlowPlay has seen unprecedented growth. The company, based in Seattle, has been searching for a buyer for some years. FlowPlay repurchased shares of previous investors after failing to find a buyer for 2020. The founders and employees of the tech company took full ownership. Wind Creek Hospitality approached FlowPlay about a potential growth opportunity.</p>
<p>Washington State does not allow sports betting, except in tribal casinos. If FlowPlay wanted to partner with a casino in order to offer mobile gaming options, it needed to look outside its home state. Wind Creek Hospitality and FlowPlay will enable both to access several states that have more friendly gaming laws.</p>
<p>FlowPlay to Maintain Operational Integrity</p>
<p>Derrick Morton, co-founder of FlowPlay, will still be president of Wind Creek and Douglas Pearson, co-founder of FlowPlay will continue to serve as a chief technical officer.</p>
<p>Morton explained in the release that FlowPlay and Wind Creek Hospitality share a common vision of how technology can enhance the player experience, particularly when it comes down to enhancing traditional gaming. He added, “This is a monumental day for our entire FlowPlay team and I’m so proud of everything we’ve done together over the last 15 years. I can’t wait to see what comes next.”</p>
<p>James Dorris, president and CEO of Wind Creek Hospitality, added that they are excited about what the teams will accomplish together. He stated that FlowPlay’s digital gaming platforms provide unique opportunities for integrations to Wind Creek Hospitality properties as well as the wider industry.</p>
