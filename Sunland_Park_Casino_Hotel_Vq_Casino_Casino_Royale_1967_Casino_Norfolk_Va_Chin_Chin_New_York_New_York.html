<p>Building upon an existing collaboration, Pragmatic Play agreed to expand the range of its products available for customers of Grand Casino Luzern's brand, mycasino, in Switzerland</p>
<p>The continuously-growing provider of content for the online gambling industry, Pragmatic Play, unveiled a new collaboration, allowing it to expand the presence of its products in Europe. On Thursday, the developer of games, famous for providing up to eight new online slot games a month, confirmed that its live casino games are now available for mycasino, Grand Casino Luzern’s leading online brand in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The collaboration enables mycasino customers to access engaging games from Pragmatic Play’s live casino vertical, including engaging gameshows like Boom City, PowerUP Roulette, as well as Sweet Bonanza CandyLand. Additionally, customers of the leading online brand in Switzerland will be able to tap into classic table games from the leading iGaming provider such as blackjack, baccarat and roulette, among games.</p>
<p>The collaboration between Pragmatic Play and Grand Casino Luzern represents an expansion of a previous partnership they linked. Back in 2022, the iGaming developer agreed to power Grand Casino Luzern with games from its award-winning slots portfolio. Consequently, those games have gone live with the gambling operator, supercharging its offering.</p>
<p>The latest deal between the two companies marks the first time Pragmatic Play’s live casino games go live in Switzerland. At the same time, the new content deal complements the growth of the company, as it continues to expand its presence to new markets around the world.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Bliem, Grand Casino Luzern’s CEO, spoke about the popularity of Pragmatic’s games since the two companies initially joined forces. He explained that the company’s games were well-received, which made it even easier for Grand Casino to add more games from Pragmatic. Finally, Bliem pointed out that it was a pleasure to collaborate with the company.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen the popularity of Pragmatic Play slots since we initially began our partnership last year and therefore had no hesitation in extending the agreement to cover its incredible Live Casino selection as well.“ Wolfgang Bliem, CEO at Grand Casino Luzern</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic’s chief operating officer, explained that Grand Casino Luzern has a strong presence in the regulated gambling market in Switzerland. She pointed out that the company is respected and trusted.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cornides said that Pragmatic’s games have been well-received by customers of the operator. Finally, she revealed that the company is delighted to continue its expansion in Switzerland by delivering products from its leading live casino vertical.</p>
