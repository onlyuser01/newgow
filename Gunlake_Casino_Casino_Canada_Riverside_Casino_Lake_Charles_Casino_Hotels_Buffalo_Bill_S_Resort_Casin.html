    <h1>Gunlake Casino Casino Canada Riverside Casino Lake Charles Casino Hotels Buffalo Bill S Resort Casin</h1>

<p>The complaint was filed for casino Scatters, but is also about Cashimashi, Goslot!, Nordslot. Actually, the complaint is about GAMMIX limited.</p>
<p>Hello Casino Guru,</p>
<p>I started playing online casino about 1.5 years ago. Unfortunately, things quickly went the wrong way. I quickly became addicted.</p>
<p>I did everything just to gamble. Every euro went to gambling. I lost my entire student loan (€ 70,000), my savings account (€ 50,000), my parents' savings account and money from friends. In total more than 200k i think.</p>
<p>This all happened in a relatively short period of time where I created several accounts in order to play. I mostly played at online casino's operated by GAMMIX limited.</p>
<p>I am still a student and was 22/23 years old when this all happened. I completely ruined my whole life in a short period of time and lost family and friends. I also had to take a break at school because of money problems. I lost everything and now I am deep in dept.</p>
<p>Now I have help from others, but this is clearly too late for me.</p>
<p>GAMMIX limited casinos are MGA licensed, which means they must protect players from addiction. I was very addicted when I lost the crazy amounts of money. The casino must have known this then, because I gambled away really absurd amounts within a short time, and the casino did nothing. Even on new accounts without verifying myself I was able to gamble thousands of euros.</p>
<p>I really want (a part) of the money back, because my whole life is ruined. Could you please help me or give me some advise?</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Julian</p>
