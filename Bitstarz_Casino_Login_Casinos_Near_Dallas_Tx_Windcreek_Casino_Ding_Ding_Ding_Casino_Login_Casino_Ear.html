<p>Buenos Aires welcomes 888, Betsson and Silas</p>
<p>The window to apply for a license closes today, June 25</p>
<p>Argentina hasnâ€™t hinted about sports betting beyond the capital</p>
<p>Buenos Aires is becoming one of the most exiting hubs for sports betting in Latin America. Will the numbers once the industry launches back this claim? 888, Betsson and Sisal Entertainment seem to think so.</p>
<p>Three Operators Join the Betting Race in Buenos Aires</p>
<p>Buenos Aires is quickly turning into a hot spot for gaming and mostly betting in Latin America. With no sports betting having kicked off officially yet, the city has already seen significant interest from international operators with years of experience under their belt.</p>
<p>The latest round of entrants includes Betsson, 888 and Sisal Entertainment, owned by Cassava Enterprises. All three companies are huge in spots betting, iGaming and even poker and all three are taking advantage of the closing window to apply for a license that would allow them to offer sports betting only in the Argentinian capital.</p>
<p>Every operator signed up with a local representative as part of the license application conditions:</p>
<p>Betsson signed with Casino de Victoria</p>
<p>888 is now collaborating with Boldt</p>
<p>Sisal joined efforts with Areltwon and El Chalero</p>
<p>These three late arrivals to the Buenos Aires sports betting market are not alone with other big brands already having signed up their partnerships. Betsson and 888 will be going up against familiar competitors, including:</p>
<p>The Stars Group</p>
<p>William Hill</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment</p>
<p>Bet365</p>
<p>Betway</p>
<p>Bet365, William Hill, Betway are some of the biggest operators the industry knows to date. The involvement of the Canadian gaming company, The Stars Group, is also a sign that Latin America is increasingly developing as a viable market for betting opportunities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Luckia and BetCris have also entered the market and local operators, Biyemas and Slos Machines, seem to be just as excited about building a product as native, local and stand-alone companies. All companies that are applying for a license hope to secure a 15-year gaming contact.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires is not offering the best terms insofar as betting revenue goes, as the tax will hit operators at 25%, and besides operations will only be restricted to the capital.</p>
<p>Yet, Argentina promises to be an important expansion point for all participating operators. Brazil is also now taking sports betting wagers, which means that Latin America is soon going to rival the United States and Europe in terms of betting potential.</p>
