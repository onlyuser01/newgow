<p>Phil Hellmuth is still on the hunt for his 16th WSOP bracelet after losing a heads up battle against Besim Hot in the €25,500 Mixed Games Championship</p>
<p>Hellmuth Loses Out On 16th WSOP Bracelet</p>
<p>It was so close yet so far for Phil Hellmuth in the €25,500 Mixed Games Championship at the World Series of Poker Europe. The veteran poker pro was just one player away from earning his 16th WSOP bracelet, but was beaten in a heads-up battle against Besim Hot.</p>
<p>The event attracted 45 runners, and amassed a prize pool of €1,068,750. As the winner, Besim Hot earned a prize worth €385,911 while Hellmuth received €238,509. For a high roller poker player, that isn’t a huge difference in payouts, but it’s the bracelet that really matters here.</p>
<p>About Besim Hot</p>
<p>The winner of the €25,500 Mixed Games Championship is Besim Hot, who hails from Macedonia. Over the course of his career, he has earned $2.1 million in tournament winnings. This recent win has pushed him to the top of the Hendon Mob All-Time Money List in Switzerland.</p>
<p>At the beginning of final table play, Hot was far ahead of the competition, with over 30% of the chips in play in his stack. He was in good company with Daniel Negreanu, Alex Livingston and Phil Hellmuth – some of the most successful poker players around.</p>
<p>When it came down to the final two, Hellmuth and Hot were heads up. It wasn’t a long battle, though. The final hand came quickly in a round of Pot-Limit Omaha. Both players went all-in on a flop of Tc-9h-9c, with Hot holding Qc-Js-9s-7h and Hellmuth with Ah-9d-4h-3c.</p>
<p>On the flop, Hellmuth was in the lead, as both players had trip 9s but Hellmuth held the Ace kicker. Jc came on the turn, giving Hot a full house, and the 4c on the river simply settled it.</p>
<p>While Hellmuth has been dubbed the “poker brat”, he was still in high spirits after missing out on his 16th WSOP bracelet</p>
<p>Feels like I’m not done yet! I’m “In the zone.” 3rd Friday, 2nd today, 1st soon? 3-2-1!! There are still beautiful tourns left, here at @WSOP Europe: $100K High Roller, Main Event, Short Deck and Colossus. Still bummed I didn’t win my 16th today, but ready to do something special — phil_hellmuth (@phil_hellmuth) October 23, 2019</p>
<p>There are still plenty more events left for the poker star in the WSOPE. So, he still has time to earn that coveted 16th bracelet before the end of the tournament.</p>
