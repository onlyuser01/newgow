<p>MGM Resorts has announced the return of live entertainment options at three locations on the Las Vegas Strip starting on November 6.</p>
<p>Entertainment Returns to MGM Properties on the Las Vegas Strip</p>
<p>The push for the normalization of the casino industry in one of America’s main gambling arteries – Las Vegas – is going at full speed. On Tuesday, October 20, MGM Resorts announced that the company would bring back several shows and entertainment offerings, staging them across three Las Vegas Strip resorts as early as November 6. The group was recently featured on the Forbes’ Best Employer List for 2020 and MGM has vowed to seek further sustainability insofar as energy consumption and generation are concerned.</p>
<p>The shows to return in the desert city’s hottest casino venues include David Copperfield, Jabbawockeez, and Brad Garett’s Comedy Club at MGM Grand. Excalibur will play host to the Thunder From Down Under and The Australian Bee Gees Show, and Luxor will set up Carrot Top and Fantasy.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts will observe health standards and social distancing protocols, allowing up to 250 people at once and making sure there is a six-foot distance between each person. The stage will be at least 25-feet away from the audience and vice versa. All measures have been outlined in the company’s Seven-Point Safety Plan.</p>
<p>Commenting on the decision to restart entertainment, MGM Resorts President of Entertainment and Sports George Kliavkoff argued that the reintroduction of these entertainment shows is an important step forward for the city’s recovery as a whole.</p>
<p>“After eight months, it’s time to bring entertainment back to the Entertainment Capital of the World.” -MGM Resorts President of Entertainment and Sports George Kliavkoff</p>
<p>MGM Resorts won’t stop here, though, Kliavkoff explained, revealing that the company was in constant touch with state officials and looking for an opportunity to bring more live shows and entertainment options.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Stars Scheduling Live Entertainment</p>
<p>The schedule of events will allow visitors to travel from one property to the next and see several entertainment spectacles in a single day if they chose to. At MGM Grand, David Copperfield will offer spectacles between 7 and 9:30 pm and host an additional show at 4 pm on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Visitors who prefer to watch Jabbawockeez may do so at the MGM Grand Garden Arena at 7 pm from Thursday through Monday. Excalibur and Luxor will also host their events in convenient hours for guests and tourists, as well as feature additional performances on weekends to meet demand.</p>
<p>MGM is just one of the properties to seek a way to restore its entertainment business. The first entertainment offering to debut in Las Vegas following the shutdown in mid-March is the X Country which will reopen at Harrah’s Las Vegas on Thursday, October 22.</p>
<p>Caesars Palace has already confirmed Absinthe for next week and Piff the Magic Dragon’s show will be available at Flaming around the same time.</p>
<p>For the specific schedule for each of the above spectacles hosted by MGM Resorts and other casino resorts, you can visit the official websites which detail the time, dates, and offer tickets.</p>
