<p>A new bill that would make sports betting legal in the state of Mississippi has been read in the State House</p>
<p>Being backed by the chairman of the House Gaming Committee, Casey Eure, House Bill 606 would amend section 97-33-1 of the Mississippi Code from 1972 in such a manner that it would enable bettors to place wagers on sports events online.</p>
<p>Five Attempts and Counting</p>
<p>The bill that has already been sent to the House Gaming Committee for further consultations is the fifth attempt made by state lawmakers in regard to the legalization of online sports betting.</p>
<p>On the first Friday of 2023, Mississippi recorded its fourth run at the legalization of online sports betting through House Bill 184 backed by Cedric Burnett. The new bill followed 2021’s efforts to accomplish the same thing with the help of the House Gaming Committee’s crafting of a mobile sports betting bill.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mississippi officials gave the green light for retail sports betting. The fresh bill would allow brick-and-mortar casinos in the Magnolia State to ink partnerships with a single online operator.</p>
<p>As for taxes, online betting would be subject to the same level of taxes as those imposed on retail sports betting. In order to pass, Eure’s bill would need to reach a majority of votes. Provided this would happen and the long string of attempts to make sports betting legal in the state would be finally put to an end, the bill would take effect with zero delays.</p>
<p>Addressing Neighboring Competition</p>
<p>Making sports betting legal in the state has been anything but simple in the past years, mostly because of the imperious need to do things the right way from the very beginning to ensure success and growth.</p>
<p>Eure has worked closely with the Mississippi Gaming and Hospitality Association while expressing his concern regarding the state’s sportsbooks actually losing important revenue in the context of residents crossing the state border with Louisiana to place mobile sports wagers.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2021, Governor John Bel Edwards inked a bill that would make sports gaming legal in Louisiana. Besides the retail sportsbooks, the bill also gave the green light to mobile sports betting in 56 of all 64 state parishes.</p>
<p>Provided this fifth attempt sees mobile sports betting apps become available and legal in Mississippi in the near future, online bettors will get to enjoy even more alternatives for betting.</p>
<p>At the moment, players physically located in land casinos in Mississippi with a sportsbook are allowed to place sports bets online at the respective sportsbook, provided a mobile betting app is available at the sportsbook.</p>
<p>The Mississippi Gaming Commission announced the sports betting handle in the state reported by licensed operators reached $43.1 million in September, signaling a 103% increase compared to the previous month.</p>
