<p>PointsBet expanded its existing partnership with Genius Sports to add streaming. The streaming will be delivered via Genius Sports’ subsidiary Betgenius. This makes PointsBet the first U.S. operator to sign up for the Streaming solution.</p>
<p>PointsBet and Genius Sports Group Expand Partnership</p>
<p>The global sportsbook operator PointsBet expanded its existing partnership with Genius Sports Group to roll out streaming services across the U.S. Under the extended deal, PointsBet becomes the first U.S. operator to sign up for the Streaming solution which will be delivered via Genius Sports Group’s subsidiary Betgenius.</p>
<p>The partnership features thousands of live streams across multiple sports and geographies as well as official data-powered in-game pricing services. PointsBet customers will be able to access the live streams via the company app and website to wager. Local players from New Jersey, Iowa, and Indiana will gain access to the live streams. Furthermore, the streams will be accessible by local players in Illinois, Michigan, and Colorado.</p>
<p>Primarily, the games which will be offered via the streaming service will be played at off-peak times. This way, customers of PointsBet will have plenty of options to wager even when the major leagues are out of action. Furthermore, Betgenius will continue to provide fully customizable in-game pricing for an array of sports and competitions to PointsBet customers. Under the partnership with Genius Sports Group, PointsBet is also going to provide its customers with access to the highest-quality official data and streaming services.</p>
<p>The Tip of the Iceberg and Important Step for PointsBet</p>
<p>In a statement, Bill Anderson, SVP – U.S. at Genius Sports Group, the parent company of Betgenius said that the company is thrilled to launch Streaming for the first U.S. customer. According to him, PointsBet continues to grow impressively on the U.S. market by offering unique and differentiated betting experiences. “With competition fierce, standing out in the market is more important now than ever, and our Streaming service provides an exciting and powerful way to do that,” concluded Anderson.</p>
<p>“While this partnership with Betgenius is just the tip of the iceberg for PointsBet in terms of streaming, it is an important first step toward strengthening our foundation for success as the popularity of in-play wagering increases.” Ron Shell, VP Customer &amp; Insights at PointsBet USA</p>
<p>According to Shell, currently, the average U.S. sports bettor places nearly perfect 50/50 split of bets before the start of the competition versus placing bets in-play. Furthermore, according to PointsBet and industry experts, soon, the wagering will focus more on in-play while the U.S. market continues to grow. This is a natural shift given the consistent overlap of U.S. sporting events, concluded the company.</p>
