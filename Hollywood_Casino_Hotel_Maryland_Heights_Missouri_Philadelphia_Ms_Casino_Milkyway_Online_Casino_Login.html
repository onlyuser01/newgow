    <h1>Hollywood Casino Hotel Maryland Heights Missouri Philadelphia Ms Casino Milkyway Online Casino Login</h1>

<p>I set up my account a few days ago, I deposited £100 and first off won about £530 on a slot game called secret cities, I withdrawn £237 with no problem which went in to my bank account the next day.</p>
<p>I played again and won £6100, I gambled a little off the £6100 and lost about £600.</p>
<p>yesterday I withdrawn £2800 and received email confirmation, this morning I opened account and noticed they returned the £2800 to my account which left me with about £5500 and within seconds my account was closed. I tried to log in and it says to contact customer support, I can’t understand if I had a successful withdrawal yesterday why they’ve closed my account.</p>
<p>I won the winnings fair and square. Please advise what I can do, I built up all my hopes to take my family on holiday and now I feel worried I won’t see my winnings. I have screenshots of my account showing my winning balance.</p>
<p>hope you can help</p>
