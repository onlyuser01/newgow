    <h1>Casino Ny Gold Country Casino Oroville Luckyland Casino Login Crocs Resort And Casino Costa Rica Hou</h1>

<p>Whow Games is a social games developer specializing in bringing Las Vegas-grade casino experience to consumers worldwide for free. The social casino experience is powered via mobile apps that are readily available to consumers and can be played from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The concept is explained as “free casino fun for everyone”. It pivots around several core tenets, including entertaining gaming products, the potential to win big rewards, and a broad network of partners. The goal is for Whow Games to reach as many players as possible.</p>
<p>A recent partnership with NetEnt, a Swedish supplier of iGaming products, sends a strong signal that Whow Games is prepared to reinforce its existing portfolio with more worthwhile additions.</p>
<p>Today, we are joined by Whow Games CEO Philip Reisberger who can walk us through the company’s strategy, products, and successes.</p>
<p>Q: Thank you for agreeing to speak with us. Could you tell us a little more about Whow Games, your mission in iGaming and social casinos, and anything else you think would be helpful to our readers?</p>
<p>When we were founded in 2014, we had a clear mission of bringing the thrill and excitement of Las Vegas entertainment to European customers. We did this by combining classic slot games with an extensive set of social game mechanics and making them digitally available in a 100% fun at no-risk environment.</p>
<p>Our efforts to establish new trends in the European social games market have made us the leading provider of cross-platform and play-for-fun casino games in the GSA region. In the meantime, however, we also count millions of users far beyond the borders of our home market among the customers of our core product myjackpot.com. We are the only social casino provider that offers a true multi-platform gaming experience among all platforms, including web, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>With all the experience of the successful operation of our B2C brands, we have also succeeded in transforming our platform into a full-service white label solution to support third parties including media companies or casino operators as competent partner for the realization of their own social casino projects.</p>
<p>Q: Several sources reported a recent partnership with NetEnt just yesterday. So far, we have not been able to find many specifics. Could you tell us a little more about this opportunity?</p>
<p>NetEnt shares our belief in the success of social casino gaming. Therefore, we are happy to collaborate with this world-leading supplier of online casino entertainment products.</p>
<p>Since the very launch of our platform we’ve been eagerly working on making the best slot games of the most renowned content providers from the igaming industry available in our free and entertaining play-for-fun environment. We bring the thrill and excitement of casino games to a much broader userbase across all digital channels and at no risk.</p>
<p>Integrating NetEnt’s games into our platform marks an important milestone on our road to adding more entertainment value and greater awareness of our platform, especially and in particular at an international level. Furthermore, joining forces adds great value to the growing demand for our white label social casino proposition and our international white label clients. The full suite of NetEnt slots will be available over the next year.</p>
<p>Q: Whow Games delivers Las Vegas games to people around the world. Given the grade of your product, do you feel social casino is the only thing you want to do? Do you see yourself scaling up to a more traditional developer beyond the social segment?</p>
<p>Our company was founded and is run by professionals with a long track record in the social games industry. With all of our experience, we are dedicated to providing end-users with an innovative and long-lasting gaming experience that is, above all, fun.</p>
<p>We, therefore, see our gamification expertise more as an extension of the proven skills of classic casino game developers to take their successful game ideas to a new level of entertainment.</p>
<p>Against this background, our work will continue to be dedicated to the creation of innovative and entertaining gamification features which are adding up to the core gameplay of those who are best in their field.</p>
<p>Q: How do you see the concept of social casinos evolving in the future? Do you reckon there is a lack of the social element promoted in casinos due to technological restrictions?</p>
<p>We have a strong belief that for social casinos there is more to come. Social gameplay mechanics are driven by the end-users desire to stand out and compete against others. They want to write their own success story, and to communicate it to the outside world.</p>
<p>Social interaction with others plays an especially major role. The success of our company shows that these principles can be applied very well to classic gaming mechanics creating a completely new kind of success-driven gaming experience.</p>
<p>Many of our employees have already done pioneering work in the field of social games in the past. Our mission is to provide fully entertaining and safe gameplay for every relevant user base. We are determined to make the social casino gaming experience far more entertaining and competitive with innovative ideas in the future.</p>
<p>Q: What remain strong markets for Whow Games in 2020 and where do you see yourself expanding in 2021?</p>
<p>After having become the market leader for cross-platform social casino gaming in the GSA region, our mission continues to be to strengthen our successful operations in the Western and Eastern European territories.</p>
<p>Q: Speaking of 2021, what does the roadmap look like for you after New Year’s?</p>
<p>We will be looking to continue innovating of our core product and exploring new product developments in the area of socially interactive games.</p>
