    <h1>Top 10 Online Casinos Bitcoin Cash Casino Casino Manchester Nh Gold Coast Casino Las Vegas Anonymous</h1>

<p>This partnership follows the recent approval of the Rhode Island iGaming bill, granting Bally's the exclusive rights to operate online casinos in the state</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation, a major player in the casino industry, has joined forces with Stakelogic, a leading supplier of live casino games, in an ambitious move to expand its online gaming operations.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Gains Ground in the US Market Through the Partnership</p>
<p>By collaborating with Stakelogic, Bally’s plans to introduce a state-of-the-art live casino experience to the North American market. Offering a wide range of popular online live casino games, including favorites like Blackjack, Roulette, and Baccarat, Bally’s aims to captivate Rhode Island players starting in April 2024.</p>
<p>Expressing his excitement about the venture, Robeson Reeves, the CEO of Bally’s Corporation, expressed his confidence in the partnership, stating: “Our collaboration with Stakelogic in bringing our live casino operations online in Rhode Island is truly thrilling. With Stakelogic’s expertise and cutting-edge technology, we are poised to deliver an unparalleled live dealer experience to our customers.”</p>
<p>Stakelogic, widely recognized as an emerging force in the iGaming industry, has been making waves in over 20 markets. Boasting an impressive portfolio of 250+ slot games, along with innovative live dealer technology, the company has firmly established itself as a leader in the field.</p>
<p>Stephan van den Oetelaar, the CEO of Stakelogic, also expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership, remarking: “We are extremely excited to partner with Bally’s, as it will pave the way for Stakelogic to introduce its cutting-edge technology in the US market.”</p>
<p>Van den Oetelaar further added that the collaboration would not only reinforce Stakelogic’s position as a leading technology company in the iGaming industry but would also present it with an incredible opportunity to further expand its growth since the successful launch of its live casino offerings.</p>
<p>Rhode Island Embraces iGaming with Bally’s Monopoly</p>
<p>The Bally’s and Stakelogic partnership closely follows Rhode Island passing Senate Bill 948, legalizing iGaming in the state and extending Bally’s monopoly in the market. The new legislation allows Rhode Island residents to enjoy casino games on their mobile devices, with the Rhode Island Lottery Commission overseeing the industry and implementing player protection measures. Despite criticism for the exclusive deal, the move marks a significant milestone for the state and is expected to bring economic benefits and enhanced consumer safeguards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the end of June, Bally’s Corporation agreed to a $1 billion sale-and-leaseback deal with GLP Capital for its Rhode Island casinos, Tiverton Casino and Hotel and Twin River Lincoln Casino, with Bally’s immediately leasing them back and resuming ownership and management. The deal may also include adding the casinos to the current master lease with GLPI, providing Bally’s with long-term liquidity and strengthening its expansion plans.</p>
