<p>Gaming content distributor QTech Games has integrated Evolution live gaming titles and brought them to partners in Asia looking to bolster their content offer.</p>
<p>QTech Brings Evolution to Asia as Part of Diversified Growth Strategy</p>
<p>Distributor of top-notch iGaming content in Asia, QTech Games, has tied-up another important partnership with Evolution, a premier content creator of live dealer games.</p>
<p>Moving forward, QTech will be able to provide clients with Evolution’s full suite of esteemed live casino gaming products, and expanding its own offering as well as the developer’s reach in new territories and with new customer bases.</p>
<p>Evolution brings an array of state-of-the-art games to QTech’s flexible technical platform that allows seamless integration with customers and quick boost to any content portfolio. The partnership will assist Evolution in accelerating its growth after recently acquiring NetEnt, a premier developer of slot and other games.</p>
<p>QTech makes it simple for content creators to distribute their products in new regions as the company sorts out compatibility and localization itself, giving an additional push to partners and improving the experience for consumers.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, QTech Games CCO Ulf Norder had this to say: “We’re thrilled to team up with Evolution. Naturally, their stunning live-dealer portfolio needs no introduction. The QTech Games platform is integrated with the best games from the planet’s top providers – and Evolution now stand at the zenith of that mountain with their garlanded games.”</p>
<p>He further noted that the live casino segment continued to be an exciting opportunity for developers and content providers, as it was still a rather underdeveloped market. Norder noted that QTech’s powerful integration tools allow clients to quickly roll out an innovative portfolio of live games for consumers.</p>
<p>Great Customization Makes Adoption Possible</p>
<p>Thanks to numerous game features, such as customization options, dedicated tables and native speaking live dealers, Evolution offers a great addition to the QTech’s existing offer. Now, Norder notes, all that is left to do is see how Evolution’s products will perform in the new markets supported by QTech.</p>
<p>Evolution, in the meantime, is on its way to expand into new and untapped markets, such as Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, a company spokesperson said in a press release, that’s all part of a diversified growth strategy in 2021. Evolution said it’s confident in its ability to deliver high-quality product that will now be paired with QTech’s own expertise in delivering a localized solution for every market.</p>
<p>Asia is a somewhat overlooked region, Evolution’s spokesperson noted, but it’s through QTech Games that connecting with a different and diverse audience is possible. QTech previously added Spearhead Studios to the mix in December. Meanwhile, Evolution broke ground in the Dutch market with a JVH Group partnership.</p>
