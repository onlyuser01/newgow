    <h1>Free Vegas Casino Slots Railroad Pass Casino In Henderson Nevada Blue Dragon Casino Atlantis Bahamas</h1>

<p>Wazdan, one of the fastest-growing suppliers of casino content which has been focusing on Eastward expansion, has another excellent deal to report</p>
<p>The company has teamed up with Avento, a popular brand operator in the Romanian market, allowing the supplier to quickly scale its local presence and launch with a number of trusted websites in the fast-developing market.</p>
<p>Wazdan has more than 60 titles to provide to Avento and its flagship brand SlotV. Avento also owns Frank and Mr Bit, which will also benefit from Wazdan’s excellent games that will be made a part of the gaming library on the website.</p>
<p>Among the games featured by Wazdan at Avento’s brands are titles such as 9 Burning Dragons, Sizzling 777 Deluxe, 9 Coins: 1000 Edition and Power of Gods: Egypt. Wazdan is also deploying some of its most unique mechanics as well, which are licensed and certified for operation in the Romanian iGaming market, including Cash Infinity and Hold the Jackpot.</p>
<p>Wazdan head of account management for Europe Magdalena Wojdyla welcomed this new opportunity to strengthen the supplier’s ever-improving position in the Balkan market, and with Avento in particular:</p>
<p>Driven by our engagement-boosting mechanics, our portfolio has gone from strength to strength, and we’re confident that we will continue adding value to Avento’s offering. Wazdan’s Magdalena Wojdyla</p>
<p>Avento head of marketing and PR Anastasia Kolmakova was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see this new content alliance form. She welcomed the opportunity to see 60 games by Wazdan now debut across the company’s brands and said that Avento will definitely be looking to add more of these titles as well.</p>
<p>Wazdan Answers Eastern European Call</p>
<p>“Moreover, all games from this provider are available in our official Google Play applications, as we continue to reach more players than ever before,” Kolmakova added. Wazdan has been able to secure a number of prominent partnerships in the Balkans over the past months.</p>
<p>The company teamed up with Winbet in Bulgaria, following a similar move with 8888 in the country a few months prior. In fact, Wazdan’s presence in the Eastern European country has been quite strong, after it also teamed up with PalmsBet. As to Romania, Wazdan has been well represented with partners such as Reevo and MaxBet.ro.</p>
