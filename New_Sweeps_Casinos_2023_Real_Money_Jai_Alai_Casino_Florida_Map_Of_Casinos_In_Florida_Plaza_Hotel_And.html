<p>Global provider of technology and game content Inspired Entertainment announced today its portfolio of table games has expanded with the addition of Space Invaders Roulette.</p>
<p>Shoot Invaders, Increase Bet Multipliers</p>
<p>The launch of Space Invaders Roulette, an officially licensed game from TAITO Corporation, is bringing new lively features to the traditional casino roulette, spicing it up to create more joy for players while enticing them with potentially lucrative cash payouts.</p>
<p>“Space Invaders Roulette combines the thrill and popularity of roulette with one of the most well-known gaming brands of all time, in what we think will become one of this year’s most legendary iGaming launches.” Steve Collett, Chief Product Officer, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Pointing to its “gameplay simplicity and fuss-free mechanics,” Collett strongly believes Space Invaders Roulette will entice a lot of players, from novices to roulette enthusiasts that are “all in it to win big.”</p>
<p>The Space Invaders Roulette features a special Cannon symbol that allows up to five special enhanced odds on selected numbers on every spin by shooting Invaders down, and upon completion of the task to take down their spaceship, the game doubles its unique number multipliers.</p>
<p>The game offers players multiple ways to win and even an opportunity to have their winnings multiplied up to 500x their single number bet.</p>
<p>Strengthening Game Title Portfolio</p>
<p>Based on TAITO Corporation’s worldwide arcade sensation Space Invaders, the new roulette aimed at the casual online casino player is defined as a medium-volatile game that pays back between 94.74% and 97.3% of the bets as winnings to the players.</p>
<p>“Our iGaming portfolio is brimming with an array of fantastic titles, with diverse themes and an assortment of varying mechanics to attract a range of different player types. Space Invaders Roulette adds more breadth and ingenuity to our thriving mix of premium online and mobile games.” Steve Collett, Chief Product Officer, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>The launch of Space Invaders Roulette marks an expansion of TAITO’s legendary video game across Inspired’s suite of products, following the launch of the title as an online and mobile slot game in mid-December.</p>
<p>With an expanding portfolio across content, technology, hardware, and services for the land-based and mobile gaming industry, Inspired Entertainment continues to enhance its product offering to create enticing products for the players while presenting operators with new opportunities for revenue growth.</p>
<p>Inspired’s ambitions continue to materialize via key business partnerships established by the developer of game titles with prominent industry names, GAN and Rush Street Interactive being among the latest.</p>
