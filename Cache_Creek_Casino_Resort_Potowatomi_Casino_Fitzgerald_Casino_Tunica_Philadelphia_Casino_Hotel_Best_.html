    <h1>Cache Creek Casino Resort Potowatomi Casino Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Philadelphia Casino Hotel Best</h1>

<p>After Wagering over 30 million Euros at stake casino my account got closed after I explained a VIP manager called Irene my situation because of the losses I received at stake casino.</p>
<p>i have been a regular user who was quite lucky at the beginning, afterwards my Luck streak disappeared and I was getting of really bad Reloads and cashbacks for losses over 100s of thousands of euro,</p>
<p>I think everybody agrees to the fact that it’s not easy to reach the Diamond Rank at stake.</p>
<p>basically I was getting ignored also my concerns and my mental health during that time. Wich has lead to more deposits and more losses.</p>
<p>After a Conversation where I told Irene the VIP manager who closed my account that I am thinking about suicide she has closed my account without any forwarning. This has led to even more struggles because the place where all my deposits have gone and where I got atleast some kind of cashback disappeared.</p>
<p>I atleast had the Rank wich I have deposited over 2 million euros for in total. All of this disappeared after the account got closed.</p>
<p>For almost a year I am trying to recover from that but without any chances to fit in normal life again. I have 780k in depts because of the 4 month streak of losses at stake, where sometimes I received a RTP below 70%</p>
<p>I have tried to Get atleast some cashback to get my life together again without any chances of even a reply from stake. It’s basically ignoring.</p>
<p>i am 24 Years old right now, the depts wich I was forced to agree to because of the losses had lead to death threats and multiple attacks wich made my mental state even worse.</p>
<p>my total losses are currently:</p>
<p>93-95 BTC approximately</p>
<p>300-500 ETH approximately</p>
<p>i have tried to get atleast some data regarding my stake account to go to court but stake basically denied to give me any information for deposits withdrawals etc.</p>
<p>wich is causing problems to take this case to law because the documents are not getting handed to me.</p>
<p>all I want is to be free from the depths I have because of this whole case. I just want to receive justice because the treatment was truly unfair at this point.</p>
