<p>The leading mobile-friendly new generation subscription poker platform, ClubGG, announced it joined forces with the American poker pro player Kyna England.</p>
<p>Kyna England Joins ClubGG as Ambassador</p>
<p>The new collaboration was announced Monday and sees England become ClubGG’s first ambassador. Sharing her excitement, she pointed out that becoming an ambassador for ClubGG marks another milestone in her poker journey. But England wasn’t always a professional poker player. In fact, she learned how to play poker back in college but then she started a job in the corporate field as a part of the insurance industry where she spend nearly a decade.</p>
<p>“Being a ClubGG ambassador is just another amazing milestone on my crazy poker journey!“ Kyna England, ambassador for ClubGG</p>
<p>How England Decided to Start Playing Poker</p>
<p>Then one trip to Las Vegas changed everything. England visited the gambling capital of the world for a conference and ended up playing poker at the ARIA. There and then she was able to reach the final table of the tournament. According to England, this is when she realized she wants to continue playing poker. This life-changing event happened just before the pandemic, but in the end, it all played well for England. During the pandemic, she practiced poker online which helped her gain more experience. Upon gaining more experience and getting even better at poker, England realized that she no longer wants to go back to her office job working 9 to 5.</p>
<p>“Then came the pandemic and I worked on my game online, I sharpened my skills by studying a lot and realized that I do not want to go back to the office full time and work 9 to 5, I would rather play poker, “ added England</p>
<p>Ever since she dedicated herself to poker, England has been reaching new heights. Her big break happened back in 2021. This is when she finished third at Iowa’s MSPT. That win brought her a hefty $73,000 prize, but she also finished third at the Venetian Man Event, which brought her a staggering $450,000.</p>

<p>After that, she won the MSPT Canterbury Park Main Event. Besides a good prize of more than $180,000, this event secured her title as “MSPT Season 12 Player of the Year.” What’s more, the win was incredibly important since it made England the first female player to achieve an MSPT Player of the Year title. Besides the title, she has accumulated more than $800,000 in earnings from live poker tournaments.</p>
