<p>A day after authorities moved against POGOs and announced they are suspending operations in 175 illegal gambling facilities located offshore, a new report by the Philippine National Police on Tuesday confirmed that the cases of kidnappings related to Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators had increased since a year before.</p>
<p>The data, cited by the Philippine News Agency, and reported by Asgam, a respected local publication, said that there have been at least 17 cases of kidnappings related to the POGO sector, an increase from the 12 cases reported and attributed to the operations of these facilities back in 2021. However, the overall number of kidnappings is actually lower nationwide compared to a year ago with 31 cases this year versus 36 last year.</p>
<p>Part of this could be because former president Rodrigo Duterte decided to suspend e-sabong, a popular betting contest that was linked to an increase in social crime, including kidnappings. The latest decision to focus on cases of kidnappings comes at a time when the Philippines is looking to repatriate thousands of Chinese nationals who have been working at offshore gambling operations.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Philippines has found out that the majority of cases of kidnappings linked to POGO operators were also linked to Chinese nationals – either as the victims or perpetrators of the crime, but often both. Kidnappings have undermined the Philippines’ international reputation and standing, forcing the country to take a harder look at the POGO sector and seek to extricate itself from a number of blacklists it has been put on.</p>
<p>PAGCOR Chairman and CEO Alejandro Tengco has warned that the issues that continue to persist in the POGO sector must be addressed firmly in order to ensure that the legitimate part of operations is alive and thriving. POGOs have been one of the mainstays of the economy, contributing hefty tax revenue. Shutting down the sector could have a long and lasting impact on the economy, but worse, it may lead to the rise of even more illegal gambling operations in the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, PAGCOR and authorities need to focus not on suspending the industry completely but on identifying those companies that have been operating without a license. The latest raid that targets 175 such businesses is a great first step, which is a good way for the country to separate the wheat from the chaff and try to sustain its POGO economy, which has been helpful through the worse period of the pandemic.</p>
