<p>The recent cyberattack against MGM Resorts may be the reason why the company delayed its partnership with Marriott International for 2024</p>
<p>Back in July, MGM Resorts International, the leading gaming, hospitality and entertainment giant, announced a new collaboration with hospitality giant, Marriott International. At the time, the duo confirmed the licensing and development of the MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy which was expected to come into effect this month. However, the collaboration was postponed to next year, MGM and Marriott confirmed recently.</p>
<p>The delay of the agreement came after MGM was subject to a devastating cyberattack dating back to September. At the beginning of last month, the company’s operations were impacted by a group of hackers. This resulted in issues with amenities, including hotel registration, slots, electronic hotel doors and others. In less than two weeks, MGM was able to resume its operations in full.</p>
<p>While the leading gaming and entertainment giant successfully recovered from the cyberattack, it is likely that this disruption caused the delay in its partnership with Marriott. The two companies issued a statement explaining that they remain committed to delivering unrivaled experiences for their loyal customers. Moreover, Marriott and MGM said that they are looking forward to bringing unique benefits for their growing customer base. Despite those commitments, the duo confirmed that the debut of the MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy can be expected early in 2024.</p>
<p>“Marriott International and MGM Resorts International are creating an extraordinary experience for our loyalty members with the introduction of MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy. Our two companies are excited to deliver world-class offerings and benefits for our guests. We look forward to debuting MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy by early 2024,“ reads a statement released by MGM Resorts and Marriott International</p>
<p>The Impact of the Cyberattack against MGM Was Temporary</p>
<p>The announced delay doesn’t come as a big surprise, considering the significance of the cyberattack against MGM. With that in mind, Marriott is also not a stranger to cyberattacks, considering that the company was subject to such activity nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>Besides MGM, Caesars Entertainment was also a victim of a recent cyberattack. Earlier this month, casinos in New York were also subject to such illicit activity as the New York Gaming Commission confirmed that Everi, an operator of VLTs in the state was impacted by a cybersecurity event. Besides a handful of casinos, the cyberattack temporarily impacted the operations of two hospitals.</p>
<p>Despite the cyberattack against MGM, Carlo Santarelli, an analyst for Deutsche Bank, said that he remains optimistic about the company. He explained that the impact was only temporary and predicted MGM’s stocks would bounce back up relatively soon.</p>
