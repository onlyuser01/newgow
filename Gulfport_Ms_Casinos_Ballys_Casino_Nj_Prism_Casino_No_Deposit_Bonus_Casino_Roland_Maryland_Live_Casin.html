<p>Sports fans in Maryland are in for a treat after the sports betting regulator in the state made a major step toward mobile sports betting.</p>
<p>SWARC Supports Licensing for Mobile Betting on a Rolling Basis</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Sports Wagering Application Review Commission (SWARC) voted to start approving online sportsbook licenses on a rolling basis. This changed the outlook for mobile sports betting from a specific date to a gradual opening of the market. While initial predictions outlined the opening of the mobile betting market at some point next year, thanks to SWARC’s recent decision, some operators may even launch their services this year.</p>
<p>It was earlier this month when the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency opened the process for licensing mobile and retail operators. This enabled SWARC to start reviewing applications. The Commission has 45 days for reviewing the submitted applications. With that in mind, the deadline for submitting applications by operators was set for October 21, 2022. While launching mobile sports betting on a rolling basis sounds like a good plan, there is one condition. The rolling approval of licenses is contingent on the Commission receiving less than 60 applications before the deadline for submitting applications set for October.</p>
<p>Mobile Betting May Come Just in Time for Super Bowl</p>
<p>It was back in November 2020 when residents of Maryland voted in favor of sports betting. The activity was then legalized in May 2021, but it wasn’t until December last year when the retail market was launched. Currently, six retail locations around the state offer retail sports wagering.</p>
<p>Still, the convenience of launching mobile betting is undoubtedly long anticipated by sports fans in Maryland. If there are no hiccups and the SWARC starts issuing licenses on a rolling basis, bettors may enjoy mobile sports wagering just in time for the Super Bowl this year. It is likely that major sports betting giants such as FanDuel, PointsBet and Caesars, to name a few, may be among the first operators to launch their mobile betting services in the state.</p>
<p>According to data by the American Gaming Association (AGA), currently, sports betting is live and legal in 31 US states, as well as DC. On the other hand, five states have legalized the activity but are yet to launch it. Three US states currently have no active legislation for sports betting, while legislation is currently dead for ten other states, AGA reveals.</p>
