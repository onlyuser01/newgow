<p>Bally’s Corp Launches a Sportsbook App</p>
<p>Bally’s Corp, a leading US gaming provider of land-based gaming, has announced entering the mobile sports betting market, launching in Colorado its sportsbook Bally Bet. The sportsbook will offer its fans innovative sports betting features. The app was developed by Bet.Works, a leading U.S. regulated sports betting technology platform, recently acquired by Bally’s Corp.</p>
<p>Bet.Works Founder and CEO David Wang, and the future CEO of Bally’s Interactive, when Bally’s closes the acquisition of Bet.Works, said that Bally Bet is the result of an incredible amount of hard work by Bally’s and Bet.Works teams. It’s essential for Bally’s future growth and strategic plans. This launch is only the beginning of what Bally’s will offer to the sports betting market in the future.</p>
<p>The company also plans to launch a mobile sportsbook in 3 other markets in 2021, other launches will follow in 2022.</p>
<p>In March Bally’s Corp became one of the companies to launch its betting products in Virginia and showcasing its cutting-edge betting solutions. The company will continue to pursue further growth in the betting market.</p>
<p>Bally Rewards Will Launch in the Summer</p>
<p>The beta launch of Bally Bet will include betting options for the biggest sports, integrated social features, and parlay games. Along with limited marketing, testing, and refinement, the app will soon see new enhancements.</p>
<p>With Bally Rewards, bettors could earn points, which they can turn into other things like dining, more gaming, or amenities offered Golden Gulch, Mardi Gras casinos located in Black Hawk, Co, and Bally’s Golden Gates, or other Bally’s casinos in the country. This reward program will launch in the summer. The Bally Bet app is available for download in Colorado for iOS, Android, and desktop.</p>
<p>Bally’s Corp Senior Vice President, Strategy and Interactive, Adi Dhandhania, said that the company is excited to launch the app and share it with sports fans in Colorado. He said that the new innovative app would give fans more opportunities to engage with their favorite teams. In March, Bally’s Corp signed a multi-year deal with MLB and became its approved gaming operator.</p>
<p>Dhandhania is confident in Bally Bet as it will provide the same cutting-edge experience it has for its gaming customers from the three Colorado casinos. He said that with Bally Bet and Bally Rewards, the company would give its gaming fans “an unmatched betting experience.”</p>
