<p>The British Columbia Lottery Corporation, a Canadian firm offering lotteries, casino games and iGaming titles, will try out a new Super Bowl sports betting concept. The concept will be trialed at local bars and a casino just in time for the Super Bowl LVI.</p>
<p>BCLC’s New Sports Betting Concept</p>
<p>It was announced that twelve bars and a single casino in British Columbia will take a part in the corporation’s promotion. The announcement confirmed that the casino in question is the Chances Kelowna casino.</p>
<p>The 13 venues picked by the operator will implement its gambling content to their digital screens. This will include live odds, as well as information about exclusive promotions on the BCLC’s PlayNow.com sportsbook and tips on how to bet responsibly and safely.</p>
<p>The corporation will promote its offerings by providing bettors at those select venues with $10 vouchers for playing on PlayNow. Those who are interested in grabbing a few free bets only need to scan a promotional QR code available on all sites approved by the BCLC.</p>
<p>This new sports betting concept is a part of BCLC’s tests of seeing how its sports betting offerings fare at land-based locations.</p>
<p>The corporation’s chief operating officer, Dan Beebe explained that the pilot is a crucial step to understanding what local sports bettors want and adjust accordingly. Furthermore, it will be a way to inform local punters on how to bet safely and urge them to be responsible with their wagers.</p>
<p>The Corporation Is Looking for a New CEO</p>
<p>The announcement also unveiled that the British Colombia Lottery Corporation is on the lookout for a new president and chief executive officer. Previously, Jim Lightbody held both positions but went on leave in September 2019 after he was diagnosed with cancer. Lightbody has now officially left the two positions in the company but will remain in the organization.</p>
<p>While Lightbody takes care of his health, the company will seek someone who can fill in the vacant CEO and president spots. The BCLC will look for a skilled substitute with strong leadership skills who can help the company increase its revenues and promote player safety at the same time. Greg Moore, board chairman of the BCLC, spoke on the qualities the company is looking for:</p>
<p>“Working collaboratively with BCLC’s board of directors and executive team, the successful candidate must be a values-driven leader who is passionate about social purpose and furthering an empowering, equitable and inclusive culture for our employees and industry.” BCLC board chairman Greg Moore</p>
<p>Until a new president and CEO is/are appointed, Lynda Cavanaugh, Lightbody’s temporary replacement, will remain in charge.</p>
