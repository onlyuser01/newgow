    <h1>Casino Hotels In Las Vegas Casino In Wisconsin Dells Casino Ignite 777 Hollywood Casino Detroit Kick</h1>

<p>Wazdan’s pivot towards Eastern European markets has not slowed down with the company now signing a new partnership with a prominent local operator in the region</p>
<p>The innovative supplier has agreed to a partnership with WINBET, which is touted as one of the country’s largest operators and providers of licensed online casino products. As a result, Wazdan will roll out 30 of its games onto WINBET, including established classics such as Magic Spins, Larry the Leprechaun and 9 Coins.</p>
<p>Wazdan Makes It Big with Sixth Operator in Bulgaria</p>
<p>This is an important milestone for Wazdan as well, as it’s the supplier’s sixth partnership in the country, following similar negotiations with INBET, Sesame, Alphawin, Palms Bet, and 8888.bg. The fact that more operators have sought to tap into the supplier’s games is proof that the company has been delivering the type of content that players expect and want.</p>
<p>WINBET is a fairly new casino in Bulgaria, established in 2015. It has been able to grow rapidly and now offers more than 1500 slot games, live casino tables, and jackpot systems all across the country. The platform has also introduced a sports betting experience, covering 30 different sports, and it has innovated the way customers can deposit, negotiating cutting-edge deals with mobile phone carriers to empower players to use mobile payment solutions.</p>
<p>Wazdan CEO Michael Imiolek commented that his company has grown very quickly in the country and that it was great to see the supplier work with another prominent operator such as WINBET. Imiolek added:</p>
<p>Our games have so far been embraced by Bulgarian customers and with even more people able to discover our innovative, acclaimed games, we’re excited to see the reception! Wazdan CEO Michael Imiolek</p>
<p>Great Opportunity to Provide More Quality Content and Grow</p>
<p>WINBET online operations director Victor Perenovski was similarly pleased to see the partnership form. He said that the operator was confident that with the help of Wazdan, WINBET will continue to provide players in Bulgaria with some of the best online casino products.</p>
<p>“We are sure that with this partnership we will further expand our positions on the market and will also enrich our consumer offering,” Perenovski.</p>
<p>Wazdan has also been growing its global footprint. The company recently inked a deal with SCCCG Management to expand in North America and launched a $1-million promotion that commenced on May 15 and will be running for the next three months.</p>
