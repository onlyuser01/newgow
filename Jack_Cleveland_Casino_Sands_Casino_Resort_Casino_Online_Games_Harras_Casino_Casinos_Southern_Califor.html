<p>Rush Street Interactive and its BetRivers brand get a boost in their presence in the company’s continuous expansion in the Canadian market. This is not the first well-known and established name that the BetRivers will be relying on for establishing the brand and building on its recognition.</p>
<p>Another Famous Name in Ambassador List</p>
<p>A news release by Rush Street Interactive – the owner of the BetRivers brand – states that Canada’s iconic sports talk radio host Bob McCown is joining BetRivers as its latest brand ambassador. “I’m thrilled to team up with an industry leader like BetRivers and work with them on delivering the insights and stories Canadians really want to hear,” said McCown, commenting on his new employment.</p>
<p>McCown’s namesake podcast – The Bob McCown Podcast – will be available across the BetRivers Network, and is said McCown will be joined by co-host John Shannon. The pair is expected to appear together at a variety of meet-and-greet events across the country.</p>
<p>“If there’s one thing I’ve learned through my career, it’s that sports fans want to go beyond surface-level game calls,” said McCown, hinting at the added value that a veteran as himself will be able to provide in terms of in-depth commentary and industry knowledge. “Bob’s unmistakable voice and brand of top-tier commentary are instantly recognizable to any Canadian sports fan,” commented Rush Street Interactive (RSI) CEO Richard Schwartz.</p>
<p>The new partnership will see McCown create exclusive content and appear in commercials as part of the multiyear contract. This means McCown will be joining the list of other Canadian sports broadcasting personalities that are part of BetRivers’ ambassador group. That list also includes famed names such as former StampsTV and TSN host Natasha Staniszewski, who joined at the beginning of August, and former TSN SportsCentre host Dan O’Toole.</p>
<p>Fast Development in Canadian Market</p>
<p>BetRivers has been working hard since it took its first steps in the Canadian market in October last year with its Casino4Fun product. Fast-forward a few months, and RSI got its green light to roll out real money gambling in Ontario. This launch was instrumental in the company’s plans to dominate the North American iGaming scene with its fantastic customer support, fast payouts, and now – its reach.</p>
<p>In June we saw the BetRivers sports book launch in West Virginia, indicating the company’s full commitment to developing in the Canadian market since it was operating a casino there through a partnership with Century Casinos’ Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack &amp; Resort since last year. Further cementing the company’s position as one of Ontario’s top operators was the Bragg Gaming deal.</p>
<p>Bragg chose RSI to launch its content in Ontario through the BetRivers brand, which seems to have been doing very well for itself. The deal is an extension of the partnership between the two companies in North America as a whole, already providing players in Ney Jersey, Michigan, and Pennsylvania with access to Bragg’s games.</p>
<p>Just last month we saw BetRivers signing Philadelphia’s sports journalism and sports host icon Mike Missanelli as a brand ambassador, showing that expanding its brand presence is not a done deal in any market that the company has developed its business. We can definitely expect more news like this in the future, as RSI continues its expansion and builds on its brand presence.</p>
