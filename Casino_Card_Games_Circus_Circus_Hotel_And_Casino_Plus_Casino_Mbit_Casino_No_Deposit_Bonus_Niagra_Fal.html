    <h1>Casino Card Games Circus Circus Hotel And Casino Plus Casino Mbit Casino No Deposit Bonus Niagra Fal</h1>

<p>Dear SIR/MADAM! I am sending you an official claim to Blackjack Ballroom Casino. The casino refuses to pay out my money in the amount of 2820 USD. I couldn't select the dollar currency when filing a complaint.</p>
<p>During the verification of my gaming account, I provided the following documents:</p>
<p>02/17/2022 - passport, utility bill;</p>
<p>03/05/2022 - bank statement;</p>
<p>03/08/2022 - updated bank statement;</p>
<p>03/11/2022 - an extract with a highlighted marker in the paint program of my full name, postal address and date of issue of the document;</p>
<p>03/21/2022 - a new photo of the statement in accordance with the requirements of the casino, the data in the letter were also additionally indicated: full name, postal address and date of issue of the document.</p>
<p>02/31/2022 - the requested documents were re-sent in good quality.</p>
<p>In response to my inquiry about the results of the verification of the documents I sent, on April 14, the casino reported that the casino could not process my withdrawal of funds due to the current regulatory framework.</p>
<p>On the same day - 04/14/2022 - I sent a message to the casino in the hope of getting an answer to my questions - "What kind of regulatory framework are we talking about? What does this base have to do with the withdrawal of my funds? Is my account verified?</p>
<p>On 04/29/2022, I reminded you of the need to respond to my message of 04/14/2022.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the answer was not provided, the funds in the amount of 2820 USD were not credited to my wallet, on May 26 I submitted a claim to the casino.</p>
<p>I studied the reviews of this casino, considered it reliable and trusted my funds.</p>
<p>The casino, in turn, acts against me unlawfully: unreasonably withholds my funds; does not want to discuss the problem with me; does not report the results of the verification of my documents.</p>
<p>I also inform you that I do not support the policy of the leadership of my country and, due to the economic sanctions imposed, my family found itself in a difficult financial situation. I'm not asking for help, I'm asking the casino to credit my wallet with funds that legally belong to me - 2820 US dollars.</p>
<p>I ask for your help in resolving the current problem.</p>
