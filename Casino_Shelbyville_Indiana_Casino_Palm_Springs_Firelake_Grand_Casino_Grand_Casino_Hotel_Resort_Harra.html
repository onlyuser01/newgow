<p>Habanero Is Now Available in Spain Thanks to 888casino Deal</p>
<p>Habanero, a developer of premium slots and table games, announced its latest partnership with iGaming heavyweight 888casino granting the supplier direct access to the Spanish market.</p>
<p>Habanero and 888casino Sign an Agreement</p>
<p>The agreement comes after the provider’s launch in Italy with 888casino earlier this year, with players from both countries now able to experience a range of unique titles, such as Hot Hot Fruit, Wild Trucks, and Egyptian Dreams.</p>
<p>The studio has established itself as a powerhouse across Europe, with the supplier now live in 17 markets across the continent. Habanero’s now reinforcing its B2B success by launching with a new operator in Spain.</p>
<p>In early April, Habanero partnered with Emara Play, a Spanish-language and Latin American-focused aggregator site. This partnership allows Habanero to expand its market share in Europe and Latin America, which are the developer’s primary regions.</p>
<p>In January 2021, Habanero signed a new content agreement with BLOX, strengthening Habanero’s Italian foothold. This is one of the best-known sites in the Italian market for iGaming.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of its Romanian and MGA licenses in Q1 of this year, Habanero is expected to extend the scope of its diverse content offering during 2021.</p>
<p>Habanero Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Arcangelo Lonoce, Habanero’s head of European business development, commented on the agreement, saying: “Joining forces with such a prominent operator as 888 reinforces our deserved reputation as one of the industry’s fastest-growing providers, and we have no doubt that our titles will get a warm welcome from its extensive player base.”</p>
<p>Lonoce continued by saying that Habenero has maintained the strong momentum created last year, having secured a series of high-profile deals and accreditations and that he is looking forward to capitalizing on this fantastic opportunity.</p>
<p>Talya Benyamini, VP B2C Casino at 888, added that the premium games portfolio of Habanero includes a wide range of immersive titles that have already proved to be extremely successful with 888 customers in Italy. The company is excited to extend its partnership with Habanero to allow 888 players in Spain to access its games, and they look forward to a long and fruitful relationship.</p>
<p>In November, the company announced another collaboration with LeoVegas, expanding its range of slots and table games to yet another top gaming brand in the region.</p>
<p>The business has not stayed away from a challenge, doubling down on its efforts in Germany’s newly controlled market and embarking on a quest to optimize its goods to meet local regulatory requirements.</p>
