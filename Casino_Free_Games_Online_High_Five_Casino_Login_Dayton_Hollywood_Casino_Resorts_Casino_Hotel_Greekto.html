    <h1>Casino Free Games Online High Five Casino Login Dayton Hollywood Casino Resorts Casino Hotel Greekto</h1>

<p>Good day!</p>
<p>Faced an unpleasant situation in the casino https://allreels2.com/ .</p>
<p>The complaint is related to limits, namely:</p>
<p>according to clause 8.1 of the casino rules, Allreels reserves the right to make payments in accordance with the individual schedule and set the maximum and minimum withdrawal amount for each withdrawal procedure, as well as the time required for this procedure, which may differ depending on the withdrawal method, account status and other possible factors affecting the implementation of the cash withdrawal process (this clause is duplicated in the rules as many as three times).</p>
<p>I believe that this interpretation of the rules infringes on the rights of players, allows its fraud to carry out fraudulent activities aimed at delaying payments to players. The lack of specific interpretations makes it possible to make payments in any amount and at that frequency, be it 1 ruble per month and this will be according to the rules of the casino.</p>
<p>I believe that such a clause cannot be in the rules of a casino with such a rating and a positive reputation.</p>
<p>On my example: I, playing on my own funds, won 55,000, while making deposits for 30,000. They sent me a schedule according to which I will be paid in 3 stages for almost 6 days. I believe that this is unacceptable, incorrect and does not meet the rules of good faith of the parties.</p>
<p>Casinoguru, you conduct a thorough analysis of the casinos that are present on your site. I ask you to review the rating of the casino, its reputation, access to posting on the site or to help to ensure that by all possible means remove these points from the rules of the casino. Casino rules must be transparent and understandable to all parties, primarily players.</p>
