<p>The leading Canadian casino and online sports betting operator, Bet99, announced a new multi-year partnership with the National Hockey League (NHL). The new deal announced Tuesday designated Bet99 as an Official Partner of the NHL.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the collaboration, Bet99 will benefit from broadcast exposure thanks to NHL's Digitally Enhanced Dasherboards. The unique approach creates different advertising opportunities. What's more, under the terms of the deal with the NHL, Bet99 and its brands will benefit from marketing rights which will help connect with NHL fans.</p>
<p>More importantly, the new collaboration will deliver a new free-to-play game for NHL fans in Canada. The new game is called "NHL PrePlay" and will be available for players during the NHL season. Participants in the free-to-play game are asked to answer questions such as "Who will win tonight's game?" Also, the players will need to answer queries such as "Which of these players will have the hardest shot," or other NHL-related questions.</p>
<p>Players that participate and answer correctly will be awarded points. Ultimately, the player that answers more questions and collects the most points will be named the winner of the Grand Prize for the 2022-23 NHL season and will collect a CA$100,000 ($73,600) prize.</p>
<p>Besides the grand prize, Bet99 explained that the new free-to-play game features "some of the most robust prizing the NHL has ever offered." Additional prizes that the players of NHL PrePlay can benefit from include a monthly trip giveaway for an NHL event, as well as weekly ticket giveaways and even NHL Shop gift cards.</p>
<p>In a statement released on December 20, 2022, NHL's Vice President, Business Development, Jason Jazayeri, said: "We're thrilled to partner with BET99 and to promote Bet99.ca and Bet99.net on this unique and innovative Free-To-Play platform."</p>
<p>Finally, he said: "This collaborative partnership has allowed us to create an entirely new Free-to-Play game that will focus on delivering a fun and immersive game to our fans, while also providing a level of access and prizing that we haven't seen before in our sport."</p>
<p>Jared Beber, Bet99's CEO, was similarly excited about the new deal with the NHL. He acknowledged that the company's collaboration with the league represents a groundbreaking deal that will benefit sports and hockey fans in Canada. Focusing on the new free-to-play game, Beber said that it will help deliver unique experiences and boost fan engagement for NHL games. Beber pointed out that NHL PrePlay's unique prizes further add to the thrill for sports fans.</p>
<p>"Designed to support our focus on education within the gaming space, the game offers opportunities for players to explore the space and become more knowledgeable without making real-money wagers," explained the company's CEO. Finally, Beber acknowledged that the free-to-play game is innovative and predicted it will be well-received by Canadians who are interested in betting.</p>
