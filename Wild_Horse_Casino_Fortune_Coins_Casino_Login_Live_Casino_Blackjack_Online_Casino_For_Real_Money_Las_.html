<p>The United States men’s national soccer has set its eyes on the World Cup. To get there, the Americans just need to finish the qualification campaign in one of the top three spots in the CONCACAF table. Right now, they’re sitting in the #2 position, with just one point fewer than the table leader Canada.</p>
<p>With just five rounds left to be played, every game is super-important. Still, probably the most important matchup in the remainder of the qualification is the one scheduled for Sunday – Canada vs the United States.</p>
<p>The game is taking place at Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton in the Canadian province of Ontario. At home, the Canadian national team is without a loss in competitive games in more than five years. Further, the last time they lost to the USMNT in Canada was back in 1997.</p>

<p>Canada Wants to Stay Undefeated</p>
<p>Canada is the only team in the CONCACAF World Cup qualification that’s still without a single loss. This team is 5-4-0 with a score difference of 15-5. They’re 4-0 in the previous four rounds, scoring nine goals and conceding just two goals along the way.</p>
<p>Of those nine goals, five were scored by forwards Jonathan David and Cyle Larin. After nine rounds of the qualifiers, the two Canadians are joint top scorers with four goals each. That said, Canada shouldn’t worry much about scoring against the US. What they should worry about is their defense.</p>
<p>The thing is that their best player Alfonso Davies will not play in this game. The man who usually plays in the left-back position is out for COVID-19. Still, he’s been out for a while now, including the game against Honduras on Thursday, which Canada won 2-0 on the road.</p>
<p>US Roster Is Packed With Soccer Stars</p>
<p>It’s been a while since the USMNT has been this strong. There are some real superstars on its roster, starting with Chelsea’s forward Christian Pulisic. The 23-year-old is the second most expensive player from the CONCACAF region, just behind Canada’s Alfonso Davies who isn’t going to play on Sunday due to COVID-19 issues.</p>
<p>Apart from Pulisic, Team US also has Timothy Weah in the final third. The 21-year-old is playing for Lille, the team that won the French Ligue 1 last season.</p>
<p>Not only are they strong in the offense, but they seem pretty decent in defense as well with RB Leipzig’s Tyler Adams, Barcelona’s Sergino Dest, and others.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it’s no surprise that Team US is 5-3-1 in the qualifiers with a 13-5 score differential. The only team that’s done better so far is Canada.</p>
<p>Picks: US and Canada to draw; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
