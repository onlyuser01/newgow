    <h1>The Inn Of The Mountain Gods Resort And Casino Windsor Canada Casino South Point Casino Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>After a long-anticipated launch, Tipico finally went ahead with the official roll-out of its proprietary online casino in New Jersey on Thursday. Following the launch of its sports betting platform in both the Garden State and Colorado this year, the company is now bringing its second main vertical to the US market, developed in-house and offering consumers a taste of the Tipico USA Technology capabilities.</p>
<p>Building an Optimized iGaming Experience in New Jersey</p>
<p>The website comes with a fast, clean, and easy user interface making it easy for consumers to navigate, but it brings over a European touch to the way iGaming websites are run. Fully decked out for mobile and desktop experiences, Tipico comes with dedicated mobile apps for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Adrian Vella, Tipico CEO for the US, said that the current version of the casino is the result of Tipico teams’ hard work over the past months. Vella commented on the growing number of US states that seek to adopt iGaming solutions, citing an average gross gaming revenue (GGR) for each state at $100 million.</p>
<p>Tipico estimates that a big chunk of its operating revenue in 2022 will be coming from states that allow iGaming. To this end, the brand is bringing a select number of software partners to boost their experience, including Scientific Games, High5, Everi, Gaming Realms, Inspired Gaming, and NetEnt.</p>
<p>With these additions, players in New Jersey will have more titles to enjoy, across numerous iGaming categories, such as classic table games, jackpot games, live dealer options, leaderboards, and more activations coming over the next months. The addition of an iGaming skin is a natural complement to Tipico Sportsbook, Vella explained.</p>
<p>“We are confident that this seamless, multi-state single-sign-on expansion of our product suite will advance our ability to acquire high-quality players in New Jersey and beyond, and retain them for the long-term as we roll out frequent new features.” Adrian Vella, Tipico CEO for the US</p>
<p>Signup Offers, Bonuses and More Await at Tipico</p>
<p>With Tipico now fully up and running, consumers will have access to various welcome and signup offers. Tipico has vowed to deliver a good stock of daily free spins, reloads, risk-free play, and more to make the experience more fulfilling.</p>
<p>Tipico has been stepping up its game in the past months, seeking more market access deals across the United States. In September, the company partnered with Caesars Entertainment to gain entry into Indiana and Iowa.</p>
<p>The company has been investing in both its B2C offer, but also bringing new jobs and establishing infrastructure to continue pushing its B2B operations with a 441-job Technology Hub in Denver, Colorado.</p>
