<p>His name is Steven L. and he started out with a $5 progressive bet, which in turn made him eligible for one of four total progressive payouts. He hit his magical Royal Flush on the flop, and that’s how he won the mega jackpot.</p>
<p>Prairie Band Casino Win</p>
<p>He was dealt a King and a Jack of Hearts, and the flop brought him the incredibly lucky 10 of Hearts, Queen of Hearts, and Ace of Hearts, fulfilling his winning five-card Royal Flush. According to Kansas TV station WIBW’s report, Steven was dealt four of a kind not four hours earlier, winning himself the Minor Progressive in Ultimate Texas Hold’em.</p>
<p>While this was undisputedly a very lucky day for Steven, the casino manager was cited by WIBW saying that there were 661 progressive wins since the Linked Progressive was brought to Ultimate Texas Hold’em and Mississippi Stud tables. The casino paid out more than $3.9 million in total progressive wins so far. Still, Steven’s win is probably of the most sizeable ones.</p>
<p>Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in Mayetta operates the Prairie Band Casino and Resort, and this is one of the six cities that have tribal-run casinos in the state. There are also four state-run casinos in Kansas City, Pittsburg, Mulvane, and Dodge City, that offer casino-style games. The total number of casinos in the state currently is 11, according to the American Gaming Association.</p>
<p>Wins in Las Vegas and Nevada</p>
<p>It’s been a busy start of the year for progressive poker jackpots, and it’s not just in Kansas. Towards the end of January, a lucky visitor of Aliante Casino in North Las Vegas, Nevada, won a progressive jackpot totaling $100,000. His winning hand was again a Royal Flush, which he was dealt in a game on a Multi Poker Progressive machine on the casino’s floor.</p>
<p>As for non-poker wins, an unnamed player won a $3.2 million progressive jackpot on a slot machine at the Bellagio Las Vegas in February. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the player won $3,257,830 on a Triple Gold Wheel of Fortune Gold Spin slot game. International Game Technology (IGT) – the manufacturer of the slot machine – announced the jackpot.</p>
<p>Other Progressive Wins</p>
<p>February wasn’t a lucky month only for slots players in Las Vegas, of course. LeAnn W. won an astounding more than $3.27 million in a Wheel of Fortune slot machine progressive game. She got lucky and won the jackpot during birthday celebrations with family members. They had another great reason to celebrate after LeAnn W. became a multi-millionaire on the spot.</p>
<p>Progressive jackpots aren’t exclusive to casinos, however. Instant Win Gaming (IWG) is a provider of eInstant games for lotteries. IWG confirmed that multiple record progressive jackpots have been awarded since the start of the year. This includes a $403,618 win in the Michigan Lottery, the $785,414 jackpot in the Virginia Lottery, and another jackpot in the New Hampshire Lottery totaling $392,703.</p>
