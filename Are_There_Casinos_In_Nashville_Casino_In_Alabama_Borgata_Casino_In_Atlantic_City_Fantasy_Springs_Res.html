    <h1>Are There Casinos In Nashville Casino In Alabama Borgata Casino In Atlantic City Fantasy Springs Res</h1>

<p>I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.ricardoscasino.net/en/terms:</p>
<p>"4.11. A bonus equal to or greater than 200% that has been claimed with any deposit, will be subject to a max cashout of 10x the deposit amount."</p>
<p>"4.2. All bonus money will be removed at the point of cash out, bonus money is money that can be used to help generate winnings but cannot be withdrawn as part of the winnings. The bonus will be treated as 'Non-Withdrawable' and will not be reissued to your account but deducted from the winnings by the casino's withdrawal manager during the payout process."</p>
<p>It means that if you have deposited €25 x10 = €250 - €125 (received bonus funds) = €125 + €25 (deposited funds) = €150.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider this rule to be unfair and predatory, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint as unjustified. I wish I could be of more help. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
