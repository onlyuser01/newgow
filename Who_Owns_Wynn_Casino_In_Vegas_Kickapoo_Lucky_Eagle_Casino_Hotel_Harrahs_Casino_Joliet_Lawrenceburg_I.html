    <h1>Who Owns Wynn Casino In Vegas Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel Harrahs Casino Joliet Lawrenceburg I</h1>

<p>The perception of gaming in the US is growing with a survey showing that two-thirds of Americans believe the industry is a positive contributor to the country’s economy.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association’s (AGA) annual American attitudes on casino gaming survey showed that 65% of Americans see the gaming industry as a positive economic contributor that provides high-quality jobs. Additionally, 73% support legalised sports betting in their state and seven in 10 Americans believe the gaming industry behaves in a responsible manner.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the survey found that 87% see gambling as an acceptable form of entertainment for themselves and others, while 57% believe the industry gives back in the communities where it operates. 77% also describe gaming as a growing industry.</p>
<p>In terms of responsible gaming, the number of Americans who say the gaming industry is committed has increased by more than 40% since 2018 and 78% of gamblers within the past year are aware of at least one responsible gaming resource.</p>
<p>AGA President and CEO Bill Miller said: "We are a committed, responsible partner and economic driver in communities across the country."</p>
<p>"Because of this, we’ve risen from the most devastating period in our history and embarked on a record-setting comeback."</p>
<p>"As legal gaming expands to new geographies and verticals, everyone engaged with legal gaming must work together to grow responsibly—our collective success depends on it."</p>
<p>The survey featured two online polls conducted by the AGA from a sample of 2,000 Americans each, both taking place this past summer.</p>
<p>The results come during Responsible Gaming Education Week which takes place between 19 and 25 September to promote responsible gaming education in the US.</p>
<p>So far casino gaming is legal in 44 US states, with sports betting now legal in 32 and the district of Columbia, with six states offering legal online gaming.</p>
<p>American attitudes of the gaming industry becoming more positive also comes just a month after US commercial gaming revenue reached a new record, coming in at $13.64bn for Q2 2021. Also the AGA estimated that more Americans than ever will bet on the 2021 National Football League (NFL) season, with 45.2m expected to place bets.</p>
