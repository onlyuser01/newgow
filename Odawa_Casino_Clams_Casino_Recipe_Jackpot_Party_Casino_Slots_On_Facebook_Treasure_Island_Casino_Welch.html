<p>Financial crimes are difficult to solve, but not impossible. With such crimes, there’s always a trace that is linked to the money and this is precisely the case of a former employee at the Aria on the Las Vegas Strip that was accused of stealing more than $770,000 in fraudulent hotel reservation refunds. As reported by KLAS, the suspect, a 38-year-old hotel operations manager with the initials B.R.J., is facing 15 charges for his alleged involvement in the scheme.</p>
<p>Unlike some fraudulent operations that involve multiple individuals, so far, the 38-year-old management employee is the sole suspect for the embezzlement. B.R.J. first joined MGM Resorts’ hotel back in 2013. He held the role of operations manager, allowing him to process refunds, as well as other financial transactions. Yet, earlier this year, amid suspicions about his lavish lifestyle, B.R.J. ended his employment at the Aria abruptly.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the suspect is currently held without bail in Clark County Detention Center. A hearing on his source of funds is scheduled for September 11, 2023. At that hearing, the 38-year-old needs to prove that the money he may use for his bail was obtained through legal ways. On September 19, 2023, a preliminary hearing is scheduled on his case.</p>
<p>Overall, the former Aria hotel operations manager faces 15 charges for the alleged fraudulent activity. Charges against B.R.J. include an unlawful felony act regarding computers, attempted money laundering/money laundering, two charges for theft of more than $100,000 as well as two charges for theft of more than $5,000 but less than $25,000. Additionally, he faces nine counts of theft of more than $25,000 but less than $100,000.</p>
<p>Suspect Allegedly Completes 309 Fraudulent Transactions</p>
<p>The charges against the former hotel manager arose after one of his coworkers grew suspicious of his lavish lifestyle. The suspect allegedly used the ill-gained funds to buy a home, fly with private jets and shop for luxury items. When asked about his expensive lifestyle by his coworker, the suspect claimed he worked for wealthy clients as a private chef.</p>
<p>Yet, suspicion continued to grow until the suspect’s coworker did an audit, uncovering that B.R.J. processed a staggering 309 refunds for hotel accommodation to a single credit card – his own. The coworker immediately notified the management which resulted in an investigation by the police as well. Overall, B.R.J. allegedly completed fraudulent transactions for a year, between July 2022 and July 2023.</p>
<p>After the start of the investigation near the end of July this year, the suspect abruptly quit his job by only sending a text message. Then, on August 31, 2023, Metro police were contacted by Las Vegas Defense Group, a law firm representing the former hotel operations manager. Consequently, he surrendered to the police on September 1, 2023.</p>
