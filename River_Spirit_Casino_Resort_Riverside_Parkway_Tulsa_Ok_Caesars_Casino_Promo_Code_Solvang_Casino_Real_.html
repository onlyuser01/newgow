<p>It may not be as grave an injustice as forcing slaves to fight to the death in an arena, but cockfighting certainly has a high degree of cruelty associated with it. Over 130 flightless fighting fowls are now free, thanks to the intervention of police and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in Dallas, TX.</p>
<p>Cockfighting Halted in Texas</p>
<p>After receiving information about cockfighting taking place, Texas authorities swooped in on February 12. The tip was confirmed, and law enforcement, along with SPCA, confiscated 133 hens and roosters from a Dallas property. According to a press release by the SPCA, 123 hens and eight roosters were saved by SPCA workers and police. Two roosters that were found dead on the spot were also taken into custody.</p>
<p>The SPCA stated that “roosters were discovered throughout the property, with strings tied around their legs and placed in cages in horse stalls. It added that several dead birds were discovered “in different places” on the property.</p>
<p>Authorities located a plywood pit in the backyard of the property where fights are likely to have been held. They also discovered “gaffs,” small blades that attach to the legs of fighting birds. Even though the blades are small, many cockfight participants are killed by their own birds while wearing them.</p>
<p>Birds Left to Die</p>
<p>The SPCA stated that many of the roosters were lethargic and had multiple injuries. “Other birds were found already deceased, having succumbed to injuries from fighting,” it added.</p>
<p>The release stated that the surviving birds were taken to the Russell E. Dealey Animal Rescue Center Dallas, “where they will receive medical attention and be cared for until a civil custody hearing occurs.”</p>
<p>Cockfighting is illegal in all 50 US states and in the District of Columbia. However, in many Latin American countries, including Mexico, it is still legal.</p>
<p>State felonies include allowing birds to fight or gambling on the blood sport. The maximum sentence is two years in prison and a maximum of $10,000 in fines. Being a spectator at rooster fights or using or allowing someone else to do so is a Class B misdemeanor.</p>
<p>There have been several cockfighting busts in Texas over the past couple of years. Police seized almost 300 birds in April from a Grand Prairie cockfighting operation worth $500,000. Balch Springs also saw 200 birds taken in August 2019 after animal services in the city investigated for odors in the area and discovered evidence of cockfighting.</p>
