<p>Information about Wazdan casinos</p>
<p>Wazdan is a popular gaming provider that specializes in online casino slots, as well as other games such as blackjack, roulette and poker. Their fun style has landed them several awards and recognition from some top names in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>You can find their games on many casino sites in Casino Guru's database, and this page will help you choose the best Wazdan online casino to play them on. You can also read about the story behind Wazdan, some of their best games, and how to find bonuses offered by Wazdan casinos.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Wazdan: an ambitious gaming provider targeting the global market</p>
<p>Based in the iGaming hub of Malta, Wazdan started life in 2010 when it started providing gaming content to the online casino market. With the prestigious Malta Gaming Authority license under its belt, it extended its operations over the next few years and released a range of slots titles.</p>
<p>Appearances at the prestigious ICE exhibition in London underlined its initial success, and in 2016 the company started integrating HTML5 technology into its titles. Players could now enjoy Wazdan games on a mobile interface which automatically adapted to the player's device, including horizontal and vertical views.</p>
<p>By 2018, Wazdan had 110 iGaming titles in its collection, but still had ambitious plans. A move to Malta came with a prolific output of new casino games, and its productivity was rewarded with a string of awards from the likes of CEEG and MiGEA.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has expanded rapidly. A clever use of strategic partnerships has seen them launch games in key European, South American and Asian markets, and a full global expansion is on the company's agenda.</p>
<p>Wazdan online casino games and software</p>
<p>Wazdan specialize in online casino slots games, and they have a wide array of styles in their collection that are backed up by some progressive software.</p>
<p>Reel Hero is an easy game to start with. It has a futuristic theme, with Tron-style hero characters and electronic music. Collect the heroes to activate their special powers, or bonus features: these include expanding wilds and re-spins. Each character has their own personality, which adds to the fun, but don't expect anything too original â€“ a lot of this game feels like a rehash of old ideas.</p>
<p>One Wazdan game that takes an old idea and adds innovative features to it is Sonic Reels. At first glance, this looks like an old-time slots game, packed with fruity symbols. Play for a short while, however, and you'll see some nice modern additions. The game zips along to a funky soundtrack and crisp graphics; speakers either side of the reels contain bonuses that are activated via the pumpkin symbol; and you have a Gamble Mode that gives you the chance to dramatically boost your winnings. The overall experience is huge fun, with the game making use of both the old and new worlds of online casino games.</p>
<p>For those after something very different, Sic Bo Dragons is one of the most unique Wazdan games, being the first title based on the ancient Chinese game of Sic Bo. Sharing some similarities to roulette, players place chips on certain outcomes but, instead of a spinning wheel, the croupier throws dice. Wazdan's version is entertaining to play, possessing sharp graphics and pleasant traditional Chinese music. In Chinese culture, dragons represent good fortune, and in this game, they signal big prizes.</p>
<p>Mobile usability and adaptability</p>
<p>While using HTML5 software is now an industry standard, Wazdan also has some nice software touches that cater to different types of audience.</p>
<p>To start with, its Ultra Fast mode lets players boost the game speed so that reels spin super-quick. If players find themselves short of time, they can zip through games without some of the animations that come with them.</p>
<p>Its Ultra Lite mode, on the other hand, offers a stripped-down version of the game, so that players with poor internet connections can still enjoy it without losing much of its overall quality.</p>
<p>For those wanting a larger-than-life experience, Big Screen mode allows players to enlarge reels so that they fill the entire screen of their device, allowing for a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>Note: The above features are designed for mobile players who don't want to experience a drop in quality, therefore you shouldn't be surprised to find Wazdan titles in one of the leading mobile casinos.</p>
<p>The different game modes underline Wazdan's efforts to make its games more accessible to different types of player and is a big reason why they are a big hit with casino users.</p>
