    <h1>Hilton Ponce Golf Casino Resort Choctaw Casino Movies Grand Lake Casino In Oklahoma Casinos In San D</h1>

<p>Dear Larpz24,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience. We accept the situation when the casino allows players from any country to open an account as long as they don’t use this as an opportunity to later cancel the player’s legitimate winnings. Simply said – if the casino allows players from restricted countries (or in this case from a country they do not have a license for) to deposit and play, they should pay out their winnings as well. If the player loses their winnings willingly by their own choice, we don't think they are entitled to a refund.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to emphasize, that we investigate further and help only those players, whose funds (or winnings) have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country. Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem that this is the case here, but feel free to correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Please, if there is anything else, we could help you with, do not hesitate to contact us, otherwise, we will reject this complaint. Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
