<p>GG.BET, an esports betting company, will soon host a special esports event called Match of LeGGends and will welcome two of the best teams in esports. The event will feature Team Vitality and Natus Vincere, which will compete in CS:GO on July 8.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs special about Match of LeGGends is that the teams will switch rosters between the maps. During the first two maps, the teams will use carefully-planned rosters, making changes after the first map. During the third map, the rosters will be chosen via a public vote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Team Vitality‚Äôs roster for the first game will feature apEX, ZywOo, Spinx, Magisk and flameZ. NAVI, on the other hand, will field s1mple, b1t, jL, Aleksib and iM.</p>

<p>In addition to being an exciting and unorthodox esports competition where two esports legends will face off, Match of LeGGends will offer many betting opportunities for fans of esports wagering. During the event, GG.BET will offer a variety of exclusive betting markets. In addition, the operator has planned a variety of social media initiatives and prize draws.</p>
<p>The competition will be streamed in several languages, including English, Brazilian Portuguese and Ukrainian. The Ukrainian broadcast will be available on the official Twitch channels of the two esports clubs.</p>
<p>The event is expected to strengthen GG.BET‚Äôs international reach, while providing esports fans and bettors with much excitement.</p>
<p>GG.BET Is Committed to Promoting the Esports Sector</p>
<p>GG.BET‚Äôs chief executive officer, Dmitry Voshkarin, commented on the upcoming event. He said that the initiative is in line with his company‚Äôs desire to expand the global esports community by providing nice surprises for the fans and creating interesting new projects.</p>
<p>We continue to work tirelessly to support the growth of the global esports community. Our task is to not only to keep coming up with nice surprises for GG.BET‚Äôs users and partners, but to create projects which will generate more interest in esports from the wider public and help facilitate esports‚Äô future development. Dmitry Voshkarin, CEO, GG.BET</p>
<p>True to Voshkarin‚Äôs words, GG.BET continues to support the growth of esports through various initiatives and activations. Two months ago, for example, the company unveiled a new agreement with Gaules, a former esports player and coach and an avid gaming celebrity. The partnership was unveiled ahead of the highly-anticipated BLAST Paris Major competition.</p>
<p>In February, on the other hand, GG.BET entered into a three-year partnership with the Esports Integrity Commission, becoming its anti-corruption education partner. The move highlighted the operator‚Äôs commitment to protecting the esports sector from fraud.</p>
<p>Speaking of the ESIC, the commission recently formed an alliance with Victoria Police, agreeing to exchange match-fixing-related information with the authority.</p>
