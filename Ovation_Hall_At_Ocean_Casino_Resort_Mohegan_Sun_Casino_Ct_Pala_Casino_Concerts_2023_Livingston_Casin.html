<p>Mabbett is considered ideal for the role due to his experience both from a gambling operator and a gambling treatment provider</p>
<p>Better Change, a responsible gambling firm operating out of Gibraltar, announced today that Robert Mabbett has become the company’s new Engagement Director.</p>
<p>Spearhead Growth Efforts</p>
<p>The appointment of Mabbett to Better Change is set to bring more than a decade of experience gained at UK operator Betfred and gambling harm treatment provider Gordon Moody and his familiarity with both sides of the industry is seen as key to his future responsibilities.</p>
<p>Victoria Reed, founder of Better Change, hailed Mabbett’s personal qualities while explaining that in his new role as an Engagement Director, he would take control of the firm’s strategic direction to continue building “on the phenomenal growth” the business has experienced over the past two years. “Rob’s passion, humility and experience is second to none and I am thrilled to welcome him to our team,” she said.</p>
<p>Mabbett spent the past five years working as a Director of External Engagement for gambling harm treatment provider Gordon Moody and the switch to Better Change happens alongside a new partnership agreed upon between the Gibraltar-based firm and his previous employer as both organizations committed to collaborating going forward.</p>
<p>“The past five years at Gordon Moody have been nothing short of incredible and I am delighted to be leaving them in a hugely strong position,” Mabbett commented, hailing the new opportunity presented before him with his new employer.</p>
<p>Exciting Challenge Ahead</p>
<p>“The opportunity to still be able to continue working in the sector alongside Gordon Moody, while spreading my wings and joining an organization which has managed to disrupt the industry with professionalism, innovation and a fresh perspective, is an exciting challenge,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Before joining Gordon Moody as a Gambling Therapy Manager in 2018, Mabbett served for six-and-a-half years as a Group Sales Manager for UK bookmaker Betfred. In between the two roles, he attended an online course on tackling addiction delivered by Human Givens College.</p>
<p>Mabbett’s professional career began in 2009 in the retail sales sector when he was appointed as a Store Manager for the UK retail food chain Sainsbury’s. Based in Aberdeen, he spent two years in the position before switching to another retailer, Asda, where he spent another six months before transitioning to the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The high-profile addition to the ranks at Better Change is expected to further the mission of the founded in 2020 responsible gambling start-up by expanding its presence in the sector, promoting positive play and creating a safer gambling environment for consumers.</p>
