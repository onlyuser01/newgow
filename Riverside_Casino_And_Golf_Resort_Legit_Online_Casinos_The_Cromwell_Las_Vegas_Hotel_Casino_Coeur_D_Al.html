<p>The lightweight clash between kickboxing genius Rafael Fiziev and the former wrestling champion of Europe, Mateusz Gamrot, is headlining the UFC Fight Night 228, which is taking place at UFC Apex on Saturday, September 23</p>
<p>Rafael Fiziev is a Muay Thai expert who lands 5.06 significant strikes per minute and whoâ€™s got a 66.66% knockout-to-win ratio. Heâ€™s locking horns with Mateusz Gamrot, one of the best wrestlers in the lightweight division who lands 4.54 takedowns and has a TD defense of 90%.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, itâ€™s clear that the UFC Fight Night 228 main event is going to be a real barnburner. Bookies seem to agree, the evidence being that the odds of these two arenâ€™t miles apart.</p>

<p>Rafael Fiziev Determined to Put Himself in the Title Conversation</p>
<p>Rafael Fiziev is a fighter thatâ€™s incredibly fun to watch. He lands a lot of strikes and is not afraid to get hit. This explains why he won either the Performance of the Night bonus or Fight of the Night bonus in each of his last six fights.</p>
<p>When Rafael Fiziev enters the Matrix ðŸ‘€ #ufc286 pic.twitter.com/BHlws8xiKh â€” Best MMA Moments (@XcellentMMA) March 17, 2023</p>
<p>Heâ€™s 12-2 overall, with his only losses happening in the UFC. First, he lost to Magomed Mustafaev by TKO on his debut. His second fight was a majority loss to Justin Gaethje last March. In both of those fights, he got hit hard by his opponents, which seems to be the only way to beat him.</p>
<p>Both Mustafaev and Gaethje are famous for their power, so no one can be too surprised that they managed to beat Fiziev. The big question is whether Gamrot is powerful enough to beat him too.</p>
<p>Mateusz Gamrot to Show Why He Was a Two-Division KSW Champ</p>
<p>Mateusz Gamrot has never lost a fight inside the distance. Heâ€™s 22-2-1 with both of his losses happening by decision. Whatâ€™s interesting is that both of those defeats happened in the UFC. Before that, he spent several years fighting under the banner of KSW, a prime Polish MMA promotion. Thatâ€™s where he was a two-division champion â€“ lightweight and featherweight.</p>
<p>Since moving to the UFC, heâ€™s 5-2, with two Performance of the Night bonuses and as many Fight of the Night bonuses. Whatâ€™s interesting is that since coming to Dana Whiteâ€™s promotion, heâ€™s won only one fight by submission. Thatâ€™s kind of surprising as this guy is a former submission wrestling champion of Europe, as well as someone who averages more than four takedowns per fight.</p>
<p>Fiziev vs. Gamrot Prediction</p>
<p>This fight is going to be super fun to watch, but whoâ€™s gonna have their hand lifted in the air at the end? We think itâ€™s gonna be Fiziev. Heâ€™s an exceptional striker whoâ€™s got the heart of a lion. Heâ€™s gonna put on a great show on Saturday and grab his 13th career win.</p>
<p>Pick: Rafael Fiziev to win</p>
