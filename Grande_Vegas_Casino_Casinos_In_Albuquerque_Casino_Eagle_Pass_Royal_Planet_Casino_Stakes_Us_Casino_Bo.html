    <h1>Grande Vegas Casino Casinos In Albuquerque Casino Eagle Pass Royal Planet Casino Stakes Us Casino Bo</h1>

<p>Dear MarlonMK,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. It seems that you were not allowed to open an account, to begin with. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.bobbycasino.com/terms/:</p>
<p>"Legal requirements</p>
<p>Reference to the "Account" shall mean an account registered by you on the web site when acceptive and agreeing to those Terms. By registering an Account you declare that you are over 18 years older or of the next minimum legal age as stipulated within the jurisdiction of your residence below the laws applicable to you. It's your sole responsibility to understand whether or not the services obtainable on the web site are legal within the country of your residence. Kindly check status of Countries list https://www.bobbycasino.com/countries. Persons below age of 18 years aren't allowed to use the web site and/or any services obtainable on that."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize a very important fact from our Fair Gambling Codex:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries</p>
<p>"The right thing to do is to check for restricted countries during the account creation process, and to not allow players from restricted countries to register and play. If the casino knows about restricted countries and also knows the player's country of residence, it's not a big issue to enforce this rule.</p>
<p>If the casino allows a player from a restricted country to play because it hasn't implemented this check, it should accept that it was the casino's mistake and pay out all winnings to the player despite the fact that they shouldn't have been allowed to play in the first place, provided that the player hasn't done anything else that's against the rules."</p>
<p>Since there is a possibility to register an account from a restricted country (see the screenshot below) and deposit funds, I would like you to confirm that you’ve submitted correct data and haven’t used a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to alter your location, when opening the account. Could you please advise how much is your active balance now? Do I understand correctly that your winnings have been accumulated from a No Deposit bonus solely?</p>
<p>Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
