    <h1>Rancho Mirage Casino Caesars Hotel And Casino Gambling Casino Online Hard Rock Cafe Casino Grand Sie</h1>

<p>888 Holdings, one of the world’s largest gambling companies, has ended the search for a new Chief Executive Officer, with seasoned gaming veteran Per Widerström stepping at the helm of the organization, which is behind some of the world’s most prominent gaming brands, including Mr Green, William Hill, and the namesake 888.</p>
<p>Widerström has been around the gambling industry, and he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors at Casumo and did a prolonged stint with Catena Media as a Non-Executive Member of the Board. His portfolio includes brands such as bwin, and others, and he also brings vast experience from the non-gaming corporate sector.</p>
<p>His appointment means which took effect on Monday, October 16 means that Interim CEO Jonathan Mendelsohn can return to his role as a Non-Executive Chair. Mendelsohn has occupied the role since Itai Pazner’s sudden leave from the company at the beginning of 2023. Meanwhile, Widerström’s most impressive achievement in the gaming industry is his time as CEO at Fortuna Entertainment Group from 2014-2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>Widerström has welcomed the opportunity to embark on this new professional career path and seek out to achieve new summits in his career. He said:</p>
<p>"The honor is immense to lead such an iconic company, synonymous with legendary brands like 888, William Hill, and Mr Green."</p>
<p>Widerström has said that the new position would require his complete dedication and that he is moving forward to ensure that 888 is steered on the right path. He said that he is also dropping his NED roles to pursue this goal further, adding:</p>
<p>"The road ahead at 888 is charged with excitement and will require my complete dedication. This pivotal moment has led me to step away from my eight NED roles."</p>
<p>His appointment and stepping into the executive position come shortly ahead of the earnings call the company is going to have on Wednesday, October 18, which will cover the third quarter and most likely post some mixed results. Group revenue is expected to take a hit in the quarter, as there have been a ream of changes to the legislative landscape, and notably much tougher responsible gambling practices in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, the company is fairly confident that this is only a temporary setback and that better times are ahead.</p>
