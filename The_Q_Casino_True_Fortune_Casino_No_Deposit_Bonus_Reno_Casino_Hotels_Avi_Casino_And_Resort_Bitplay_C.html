    <h1>The Q Casino True Fortune Casino No Deposit Bonus Reno Casino Hotels Avi Casino And Resort Bitplay C</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I am desperate. I was scammed by this casino and lost so much money and I don't know how to handle it. They literally scammed me. I was playing slots normally like a normal person and had unlocked a bunch of progressive slots then jumped in and cashed out all at once. The casino, after denying me the welcome bonus, one day sends me a statement where they tell me that my account would be suspended on June 30th (without specifying the reason). So last night I decide to withdraw the winnings. When I log into my account I notice that some of the slots I was playing have been reset eating my money. Then today since not all of them have been reset I wanted to finish playing them but my account was closed early without giving me any explanations. I'm desperate because they scammed me and I don't know how to do it. I am ready to bring all screenshots and evidence of my scam and I am hoping for your help before I have to go through legal action. They literally ate me 2000 euros and I'm desperate. I don't know how to go about it as when I contacted the casino they said they can do whatever they want. In addition, they wrote to me not to write to assistance anymore because "it's useless". Please help me, I would ask that I be given access to my gaming account and restore the slots I was playing or I would ask if it is possible to get the 2000 loaded back. They just scammed me I don't know how to do it</p>
