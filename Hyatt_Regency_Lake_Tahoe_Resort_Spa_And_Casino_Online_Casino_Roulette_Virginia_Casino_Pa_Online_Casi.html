    <h1>Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort Spa And Casino Online Casino Roulette Virginia Casino Pa Online Casi</h1>

<p>all the reviews on this casino is true when it comes to making a payout and asking for documents over and over just to keep from paying. They first did me wrong by giving me a free chip I didnt even ask for but as a thank you and due to being vip my account manager just added it on my account. I actually won off the chip but because i redeemed one right before he put one on my account i couldnt get my winnings and was told i redeemed 2 chips in a row. Umm no i didnt that was given to me as a nice surprise and im getting reprimanded cause of yall mistake. They should have paid my winnings being i followed all rules and regulations when it comes to deposits and bonuses its not my fault the account manager didnt do his due diligence and see if i had redeemed a chip or not. Now that i had to make them take it off so i can deposit and actaully take home a winning was also a pain in the anus. I use a vip only deposit match that was sent in my email 66 dollars for 600 percent match and 200 chip. I actually won off the deposit match put in a withdraw less then the max i could take out in which was only $700. I asked for $400 and they still removed $116 form my bonus alerting me the max is $700 but even though i made it through the play through they still had to remove bonus money. That dont make sense nor the math if my max is $700 then i should be able to get just that. They took form it left me with $284 in which is truly the max i could have cashed out according to their messed up math. I let that go and ask for my winnings. I have waited since 8/18 sent my documents 3 times already called and emailed eery department they have and put my documents in the chat to finally get verified. They have yet to do so with the same excuse they havent gotten it when i literally ahve emails confirming they have my email and to give 24 hours. Im now asked to wait until 9/01/23 for my winnings I told them if i dont have it by then ill let it go begging them for it and i will go ahead and report them for crypto fraud. they have taken crypto currency promising a product and service but have yet to deliver on the service and product. Ill update you guys if they paid or not. Until then I say STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASINO THEY LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL THEY COME UP WITH EEEVVVERYTHING TO NOT PAY and again i never used my card i strictly used crypto so theres no reason for any type of delay. Oh btw youre never ever verified if i play and win again i got to send in the same documents AGAIN to get my winnings, yeah a casino to stay FAR FAR FROM unless you want to provide documentation everytime you win and not to mention providing them over and over again to still not be paid. STAY AWAY they been closed before for a reason</p>
