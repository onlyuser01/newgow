<p>Leading iGaming content provider Pragmatic Play has expanded its presence in Venezuela through a new agreement with a local operator. The supplier will join forces with Liderendeportes.bet, a local iGaming operator that will help Pragmatic Play’s content reach more Venezuelan gamblers.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Powers Liderendeportes.bet with content</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Pragmatic Play will power the South American operator with some of its best titles. As per the deal, the supplier will provide Liderendeportes.bet with hit slot games, immersive live casino experiences and engaging virtual sports products. Pragmatic Play’s suite of content is already live in many LATAM jurisdictions and enjoys a lot of popularity from local players.</p>
<p>As a result of the deal, Liderendeportes.bet will be able to provide award-winning Pragmatic Play classics to its customers, including beloved games such as Sugar Rush and Gates of Olympus. The operator will also be able to engage its fans with freshly launched slots like Reel banks and Fury of Odin Megaways. In addition, Liderendeportes.bet will be able to provide fans with Pragmatic Play’s live casino titles, which include games such as Sweet Bonanza CandyLand and Mega Wheel.</p>
<p>Sports fans, on the other hand, will be able to wager on a rich selection of virtual sports products. These include Force 1 content, horse racing and greyhound racing. All games have detailed 3D renderings of the sports they represent and offer a huge selection of wagering markets.</p>
<p>Both Parties Are Excited about the Deal</p>
<p>Liderendeportes.bet’s team is very happy to include Pragmatic Play content in its content offering. The brand’s president, Felipe Saldivia, said that the current agreement is great news for both the company and its players. According to him, it signals an influx of top industry content that players will now be able to enjoy. Saldivia emphasized that Liderendeportes.bet is committed to providing fans with the best possible casino experiences, as attested by the current agreement.</p>
<p>Victor Arias, Pragmatic Play’s vice president of LATAM operations, also spoke on the deal. He said that Pragmatic Play is just as happy to shake hands with Liderendeportes.bet as the operator is. According to Arias, the new agreement helps the provider secure yet another valued partner in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Again, we’re able to supply a multi-vertical package which is a testament to the quality and revenue-generating potential of our content in several areas. Victor Arias, VP LATAM operations, Pragmatic Play</p>
