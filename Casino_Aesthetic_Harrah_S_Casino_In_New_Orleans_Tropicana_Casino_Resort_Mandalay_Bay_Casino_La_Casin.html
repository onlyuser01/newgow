<p>NeoGames subsidiary and global iGaming aggregator, Pariplay, confirmed that its Ignite partner, Slotmill, has gone live in the UK</p>
<p>The global iGaming aggregator and a subsidiary of NeoGames S.A, Pariplay, announced that one of its Ignite partners, Slotmill, will expand to in the UK. Confirmation about the announcement came Tuesday and the launch of Slotmill in the UK marks its debut for the country.</p>
<p>In addition to the UK market, Pariplay confirmed that its Ignite partner plans to grow its global footprint by entering the United States as well. Currently, Slotmill expects to go live within the iGaming market in New Jersey via Pariplay’s Ignite program. Still, it’s important to mention that the launch is subject to relevant approvals.</p>
<p>Entering the UK marks an important move for the Stockholm-based games studio. This is because Slotmill is entering an important market on the Old Continent and delivering its games to new audiences in the country. The UK entry will bring top-performing high-quality games from the developer that stand out with optimization features for areas that do not support stable internet connections.</p>
<p>The launch in the UK makes Slotmill the latest partner to benefit from Pariplay’s Ignite program. The unique program enables the aggregator to deliver games from up-and-coming iGaming developers by leveraging Pariplay’s extensive list of online gambling licenses. Thanks to Ignite, iGaming developers can expand rapidly to new markets, extending the reach of their games.</p>
<p>Pariplay Is Excited to See Slotmill Go Live in the UK</p>
<p>Andreas Ternström, Slotmill’s chief commercial officer, was significantly excited to see the company enter a new market. He explained that Slotmill is delighted to deliver its engaging games to new audiences in the UK. “To launch through a new partnership is extra satisfying, and we thank Pariplay for their speed and their efficiency, with which they’ve introduced us to our very first market,” said Ternström in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We’re super excited that players in the UK are now able to enjoy our games.“ Andreas Ternström, chief commercial officer at Slotmill</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes on the heels of an important appointment announced by Pariplay. Earlier this week, the company revealed that it expanded its global team of experts by hiring Irina Roman. Joining NeoGames’ subsidiary, she was appointed to the role of head of account management. The appointment comes at a time when Pariplay plans to strengthen its C-suite and expand further on a global scale.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to be able to take Slotmill live in the UK, after a successful and swift partnership via Ignite.“ Enrico Bradamante, chief commercial officer at Pariplay</p>
<p>Enrico Bradamante, the company’s chief commercial officer, shared his excitement about the launch of Slotmill in the UK. He explained that the launch marks an important achievement for the developer of games that delivers exciting and innovative titles supported by leading technology. Finally, Bradamante said that Pariplay is looking forward to seeing the positive results of Slotmill’s UK launch.</p>
