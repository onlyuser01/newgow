<p>A popular US media personality is joining online sports betting and gaming operator BetMGM to boost its efforts to build brand awareness and engage with sports fans and bettors.</p>
<p>Sports Betting and MMA</p>
<p>Leading sports betting and iGaming brand BetMGM announced last week that mixed martial arts (MMA) journalist Ariel Helwani joined the company as a brand ambassador. The prominent figure will help build BetMGM awareness via integration of the brand’s content into his promotions, while upcoming marketing campaigns, social media initiatives and fan events of the company will feature the award-winning media personality.</p>
<p>Speaking about his new role, Ariel Helwani, who has previously worked with major sports outlets like ESPN and SB Nation, outlined the close link between sports betting and MMA, and that this relationship is more likely to deepen as more states legalize wagering on sports.</p>
<p>Helwani will serve as BetMGM brand ambassador while continuing to honor his obligations at The MMA Host for Vox media, as well as The Ringer MMA Show podcast, bringing its invaluable insight from the latest fights across MMA, boxing and pro wrestling.</p>
<p>Ariel has played a prominent role over the years in growing MMA to the masses. His extensive knowledge and signature reporting style makes (sic) him a tremendous addition to the BetMGM team.” Matt Prevost, CRO, BetMGM</p>
<p>Engaging with Sports Fans</p>
<p>The appointment of Ariel Helwani as a brand ambassador at BetMGM is the latest engagement between the brand and the world of martial arts, after a deal in June made the co-owned by MGM Resorts and Entain brand Official Gaming Partner of the Professional Fighters League (PFL).</p>
<p>Recipient of the World MMA Award of the Year for ten consecutive years, Helwani is joining a prominent company of BetMGM brand ambassadors, featuring the likes of Marshawn Lynch, Wayne Gretzky, Jalen Rose and Barry Sanders.</p>
<p>Sports betting has always been intertwined with the mixed martial arts world and now, with its availability in more states, I’m excited to work hand-in-hand with BetMGM to deliver unique insights into the sports betting world.” Ariel Helwani, Brand Ambassador, BetMGM</p>
<p>In July, BetMGM appointed NFL great Marshawn Lynch as a brand ambassador to participate in marketing initiatives of the sportsbook brand across social media and in person. Lynch followed hot in the heels of NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, who had joined BetMGM as a brand ambassador in June.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the sports betting and online gaming brand added Michigan NBA legend and analyst Jalen Rose as its celebrity ambassador to help the brand strengthen its bonds with sports fans in the Great Lakes State, as well as NFL Hall of Fame player Barry Sanders as its brand ambassador in Michigan.</p>
