<p>AC Milan vs. Juventus is the biggest soccer game of the weekend not just in Serie A but possibly even in the whole world. The duel between the top team in the standings and the No. 3 is on the program on Sunday, October 22, at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza</p>
<p>AC Milan vs. Juventus might not be the biggest rivalry in Italian soccer, but in October 2023, it’s one of the most exciting duels on the planet. The reason is that both teams have been playing fantastic soccer since the start of the season, which is what got them to the summit of the Italian Serie A table. AC Milan is sitting at the very top of the table, while Juventus is third with just four points fewer.</p>

<p>AC Milan Wants to Keep the Good Run Going</p>
<p>AC Milan is without a single loss in all competitions in the last five games. During this period, we saw the black-and-reds score 7 goals while conceding just one. Before that, however, they got demolished by Inter 5-1.</p>
<p>After the loss in the Derby Della Madonnina, Stefano Pioli’s men have been fantastic at the back. Their offense could’ve been more productive but given that their recent schedule has been pretty tough, it’s fair to say that they’ve done okay.</p>
<p>Another explanation for why AC Milan hasn’t been doing as well offensively as some fans might expect is that a couple of their forwards only joined the club a few months ago – Christian Pulisic, Noah Okafor, and Luka Jovic.</p>
<p>Juventus Doing Great Despite Problems On and Off the Pitch</p>
<p>French superstar Paul Pogba is suspended for using doping. His Italian colleague Nicolo Fagioli is suspended for illegal gambling. These two midfielders won’t return to action anytime soon, but that’s not the only problem Juve is facing right now.</p>
<p>Juve will also be without two Brazilian full-backs, Alex Sandro and Danilo, who are injured. Speaking of injuries, forward Federico Chiesa will also miss the AC Milan vs. Juventus game on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sure, Juventus has plenty of backups to cover for them, but without those guys, it’s going to be difficult to beat AC Milan. In fact, the black-and-whites are going to struggle even to win a single point from their trip to San Siro.</p>
<p>AC Milan vs. Juventus Prediction</p>
<p>Pioli’s boys are undefeated against this opponent in the last five AC Milan vs. Juventus games. Further, the last time they welcomed them at San Siro, they won 2-0. We suspect something similar might happen this time as well.</p>
<p>Picks: AC Milan to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
