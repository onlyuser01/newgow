    <h1>Pa Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Casa Blanca Hotel Casino Golden Gate Casino Bus Schedule Casino Ca</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I deposited CAD30 and completed the wagering as always, I never bet higher than detailed in the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of CAD505 initially was rejected due : Need verification and then due : Not enough balance and then on due high bet.</p>
<p>1- The verification was successfully completed, still the withdrawal rejection was maintained due an exact bet of CAD 20.79. A bet with fractions !</p>
<p>2- I contacted Casoo Support Team again and I forwarded screenshots about Sumner Holiday game maximum bet being CAD10 on Casoo and many other casinos. Then the rejection reason changed, it became a rejection be cause of re-playing the free spins !</p>
<p>NB. Summer Holiday game gives the player the option to chose between :</p>
<p>a - Re-play the 15 free spins which means that the first winnings from the 15 free spins becomes zero winnings but the 15 free spins are repeated once only.</p>
<p>b- Accept the winnings from the 15 free spins without replaying them and return to the game.</p>
<p>c- Take a chance on the surprise box and win whatever amount is in it.</p>
<p>I often use choice a or b depending on the winnings, choice c could hit really high or even less then the amount won by the free spins.</p>
<p>I play Summer Holiday on many casinos with bonus money and during wagering never had I encountered any similiar allegations.</p>
<p>The game offers the possibility to repeat the 15 free spins as an option among three other options. The player does not interfere with the software of the game.</p>
<p>I bet the minimum allowed bet CAD1 only.</p>
<p>Casoo Team incorrectly explained that replaying the free spins generats higher bets, where is this explained , mentioned or clarified?</p>
<p>No where. Casoo accused me of CAD20.79 high bet, they did not know, they claimed they contacted the software provider, Microgaming will not support accusing a player of breaching the game rules on a game that offers an option, an option offered to the player is not his responsibility to analyse the software.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I played Summer Holiday game on another casino, when my cash was over and only bonus money was available I was not able to Re-play the free 15 spins instead I had the option to accept the winnings or to take the surprise box option. This is what casoo should do, deactivate the option to replay the 15 free spins while on bonus money. Had I known that the Summer Holiday game option of replaying the free spins could generate internal Software related bets as alledgedly quoted by Casoo I would have spent my CAD30 elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is also worth it mention that my game history surprisingly disappeared from my Casoo account one day after the withdrawal rejection occured, why would gaming history disappears from the player's account. Casoo said they are not committed to keeping gaming history for more than 3 days, 3 days ? It disappeared one day after the winnings.</p>
<p>They did provide me with screenshots and Excel sheet showing CAD20.79 amount but this does not mean I bet 20.79 it is impossible to bet 20.79.</p>
<p>I have all the correspondence.</p>
<p>I think that Casoo management should have demonstrated more flexibility instead of jumping to different unjustified conclusions, they victoriously announced that the rejection decision is final.</p>
<p>In reality they lost a regular client who is spending his money elsewhere.</p>
<p>I trust Guru Resolution Team and I commit myself to comply to whichever decision you take in this complaint.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p>Joseph.</p>
