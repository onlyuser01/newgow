<p>The popular lottery that calls itself “Home of bigger jackpots for bigger dreams” Win Millions Lotto has announced the launch of two fresh lotteries with massive jackpots. The two new options are light or mini versions of two of their most popular lotteries: Mega Millions and Powerball. Both Mini Mega Millions and Mini Powerball will introduce players to a minimum jackpot of $50 million. At the same time, they will allow global players from all parts of the world to play, which is not possible when playing standard games.</p>
<p>How Do the Two New Mini Lotteries Work?</p>
<p>The results of the two new lotteries will rely on the same draws as the regular Mega Millions and Powerball games. However, players get the chance to place their bets on the winning numbers after trying to make an accurate guess. In other words, players no longer have to worry about traveling all the way to the US to purchase tickets for Mega Millions and Powerball. Win Millions Lotto, therefore, gives players located outside the US the chance to enjoy a safe, simple, and convenient way of playing their favorite lottery games with their local currencies. In return, this provides them with a more versatile selection of payment options for funding accounts and cashing out potential winnings.</p>
<p>Mega Millions+ and Powerball+ Jackpots Start at $500 Million</p>
<p>Similar to the mini lottery releases mentioned earlier, Win Millions Lotto also launched two maxi versions of the same two popular lotteries. Mega Millions+ and Powerball+ rely on an identical lottery game format. However, as expected, their jackpots are mind-blowing and they start at $500 million. Win Millions Lotto’s chief executive officer Sulim Malook spoke about the lottery’s special sign-up offer bringing newcomers six free lottery tickets and the massive size of the maxi lottery jackpots. He stated that, in his opinion, the expenses will be well worth it and eventually pay off, calling their jackpots “a game changer”. Malook also argued that since they are born digital, they are also “lean”. Finally, the CEO expressed the company’s excitement regarding the completion of Crypto Millions Lotto’s rebranding.</p>
<p>At the moment, Win Millions Lotto offers access to the greatest, most successful lotteries on the planet. The company currently operates in more than 180 countries, displays all jackpots in US$, and pays out players’ winnings in their preferred currency, including Pesos, Bitcoin, and British Pounds. In April, a very lucky player from Arizona won a $473.1 million Powerball jackpot. At the end of August, an anonymous player won the $1.34 billion Mega Millions jackpot in Illinois but failed to come forward and claim the prize.</p>
