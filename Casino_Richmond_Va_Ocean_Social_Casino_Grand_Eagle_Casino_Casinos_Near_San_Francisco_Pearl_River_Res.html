    <h1>Casino Richmond Va Ocean Social Casino Grand Eagle Casino Casinos Near San Francisco Pearl River Res</h1>

<p>Closely following its creed to completely revolutionize the way gambling is done with the help of online streaming, Livespins has added Platipus Gaming to its list of gaming studio partners. The Business-to-Business provider on a clear mission to augment players’ experiences has once again proven it has zero time to waste. Just one day ago, Livespins expanded its gaming portfolio with Booming Games titles. Fantasma Games and Yggdrasil are other heavyweight names that the provider added to the same reputable line-up in the last few months.</p>
<p>What Does the New Platipus Gaming Partnership Mean?</p>
<p>Livespins, which is determined to take the iGaming world by storm with shared experiences is already live with CasinoFriday.com. Thanks to the newly sealed partnership, the provider will now allow streamers to use popular Platipus Gaming titles mostly known at cryptocurrency casinos. Launched in 2015, Platipus is a well-known creator of table games and slots with popular games like Joker Chase, Wild Spin, and Hot Fruits in its portfolio.</p>
<p>Platipus Gaming’s chief marketing officer, Vladyslav Garanko, commented on the new deal, expressing the company’s excitement to join forces with Livespins while acknowledging the fact that streaming is “absolutely the future of online casino.” The fresh agreement is expected to allow Platipus to leverage the “huge potential” of this new casino gaming approach.</p>
<p>Livespins’ chief commercial officer, Michael Pedersen, also recognized the earned reputation of its new gaming studio partner, praising the “striking design and big sound” of its slots and calling its gameplay “next level.”</p>
<p>How Does Livespins’s Platform Work?</p>
<p>Livespins allows gamers to watch their favorite streamers engage in online slot gameplay while being allowed to play with them, side by side. The provider has created a long list of excellent streamers that the audience can choose from. Once a streamer is selected, the gamer can play right behind the streamer. To do this, they must place a bet as a group. They are given the freedom of selecting the bet amount as well as the number of spins. Players can also interact with the rest of the chat and react to the streamer’s actions on-screen during the live stream, completing the socially charged online casino experience provided by Livespins.</p>
