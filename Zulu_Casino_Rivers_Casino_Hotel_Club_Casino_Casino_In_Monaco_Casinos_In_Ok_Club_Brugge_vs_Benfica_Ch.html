<p>Club Brugge with a Chance to Make History</p>
<p>When they booked the ticket to the Round of 16 of the 2022-23 Champions League, Club Brugge became only the second Belgian team to play in the knockout phase of soccer‚Äôs most elite competition.</p>
<p>Before them, Gent did the same in the 2015-16 season. Gent‚Äôs journey ended in that phase, meaning that Club Brugge have a chance to become the first Belgian team to make the UCL top 8.</p>

<p>For that to happen, they need to do better than Benfica in the UCL doubleheader. Beating Benfica in Portugal looks like a mission impossible, but getting a good result in Belgium doesn‚Äôt seem that crazy.</p>
<p>These guys tend to play well at home, the evidence being that they went 2-0-1 at home in the group stage in the Champions League.</p>
<p>The Eagles Playing Superb Soccer in 2023</p>
<p>Benfica players have been brilliant this entire season, but especially since the start of 2023. They‚Äôre superb in the offense, with Goncalo Ramos being their most dangerous striker.</p>
<p>Then, there‚Äôs Joao Mario, who‚Äôs been a true midfield general this season. One of his colleagues from the center of the pitch ‚Äì Enzo Fernandez ‚Äì has moved to Chelsea, but Benfica don‚Äôt seem to be missing him.</p>
<p>They‚Äôre great at keeping the ball in their possession and not letting the opposition create too many scoring chances. The result is that in most of their 2023 games, Benfica managed to keep a clean sheet.</p>
<p>Club Brugge vs Benfica Prediction</p>
<p>Benfica are the better team, but Club Brugge are going to give their 100% on Wednesday. The Belgians have had plenty of time to prepare for this game, meaning that they could put on a much stronger resistance than what UCL odds are suggesting. In fact, we think they can make an upset and hold the Portuguese visitors to a draw.</p>
<p>Picks: Club Brugge and Benfica to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
