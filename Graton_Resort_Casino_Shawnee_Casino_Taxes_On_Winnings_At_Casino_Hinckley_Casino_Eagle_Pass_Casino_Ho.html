<p>Florida-headquartered casino and hospitality company Hard Rock International envisions putting in $70 million into adding a hotel to its casino in Cincinnati. The expansion will make the casino more attractive to bettors from further destinations.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Details Its Vision</p>
<p>Jon Lucas, Hard Rock’s chief operating officer, revealed more about this idea. According to him, adding a hotel is “critical to the continued success” of the property. With an adjacent casino, people will be less rushed to drive back home or book a room in another hotel in the city. Instead, visitors will be able to enjoy themselves, place a bet, eat on-site and then spend the night in the planned Hard Rock hotel.</p>
<p>Hard Rock’s plans are to construct the hotel either north of the casino’s parking garage or in the casino’s front lawn on Eggleston Avenue. Lucas said that he thinks the construction will go rather quickly since the company has a clear plan and has already concluded a feasibility study together with the brand’s partners.</p>
<p>Lucas spoke in detail about Hard Rock’s vision for the new hotel. According to him, the Hard Rock Cincinnati hotel is planned to have a total of 300 rooms. The company envisions having several luxury suites for affluent clients. The establishment will also include other non-gaming facilities, such as a fitness center for sportive visitors and a spa for those who want to shift between the thrill of gambling and relaxation.</p>
<p>The company’s commitment to providing good accommodation is further attested by its recent $40 million investment in the improvement of its dining offerings concert venues.</p>
<p>“What we do is we create the real entertainment facility that has a lot of the non-gaming amenities,” Lucas explained.</p>
<p>The Company Wants to Make the Property More Attractive to Bettors</p>
<p>Lucas elaborated that this addition will not change a lot to local customers who want to put a quick punt but will make a great difference to people who either come from afar and/or want to stay for a longer period of time. The hotel will dramatically increase the conveniences for the latter group as it will provide them with a great show, great food and great beverage, on top of a comfortable accommodation facility.</p>
<p>Hard Rock’s goal is to make its Cincinnati property a much more attractive destination to bettors from across the state. The decision to construct a hotel is not only also a strategic response to Hard Rock’s nearby competitors who are boosting their business. For example, Churchill Downs, which is only 100-ish miles away, recently invested $148 million in the expansion of its Turfway park and is planning to open a new gaming venue by 2023.</p>
<p>Hard Rock is also envisioning expanding its business outside of Ohio. The company recently announced its plans to build two new casinos – one in New Jersey and one in New York.</p>
