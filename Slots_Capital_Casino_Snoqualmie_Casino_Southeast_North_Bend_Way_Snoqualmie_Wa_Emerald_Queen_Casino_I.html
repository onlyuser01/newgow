    <h1>Slots Capital Casino Snoqualmie Casino Southeast North Bend Way Snoqualmie Wa Emerald Queen Casino I</h1>

<p>I was playing EXCALIBUR Slot and had already spent a large amount.</p>
<p>EXACTLY WHEN I GOT THE BONUS, problems started.</p>
<p>In the 1st part of the bonus I won and it went on to the 2nd part where a roulette wheel accumulates multipliers......at that time it crashed.</p>
<p>Tried talking to support, they say no problem.</p>
<p>However, I have the video and the print screen BECAUSE MY USER IS STILL STUCK IN THE GAME.</p>
<p>PIN UP SUPPORT ACT IN BAD FAITH, making users give up complaints because they do not evaluate correctly.</p>
<p>I believe that for all the bad faith shown, they should return all the money I spent that night on that game (they just need to see the logs) and they should pay me a bonus round for LUCK to decide.</p>
<p>I have the emails where their support claims that everything is normal....the attached video proves that they are lying.</p>
