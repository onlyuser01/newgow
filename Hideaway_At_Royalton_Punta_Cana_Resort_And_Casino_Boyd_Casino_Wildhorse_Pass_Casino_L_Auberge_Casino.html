    <h1>Hideaway At Royalton Punta Cana Resort And Casino Boyd Casino Wildhorse Pass Casino L Auberge Casino</h1>

<p>Bragg Gaming Group has made another firm step in the US iGaming market with the supplier confirming a new content partnership with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino. The alliance is focused on New Jersey and the supplier will provide a range of its titles along with the company’s Remote Game Server (RGS) technology.</p>
<p>The move is of strategic importance for Bragg as the company continues to build up its momentum in the North American region and pivot towards new opportunities in both the United States and Canada, and beyond.</p>
<p>A range of games will be made available to Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino as a result, including but not limited to Golden Eyes, Fairy Dustand theGirl, Egyptian Magic and more. The content comes from Bragg’s Atomic Slot Lab studio, which operates as an individual development unit under the company’s umbrella.</p>
<p>Bragg and Caesars are not strangers to each other, as the two companies have already collaborated successfully in the regulated iGaming market in Michigan. A partnership was set up in 2022, seeing Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino benefit from the dedicated Spin Games RGS brought by Bragg.</p>
<p>This new stride in the Garden State will further help strengthen the supplier’s local position and establish its ambitions for broader recognition among players and leading operators. The partnership was welcomed by Bragg Chief Executive Officer Yaniv Sherman who praised the opportunity to see his company integrate on a deeper level with Caesars, which he called "synonymous with the very best casino gaming entertainment."</p>
<p>He said that Bragg Gaming was looking forward to further expanding and bringing more of its quality content and products to the North American region. Sherman noted that he was happy to further strengthen the long-standing relationship between the two companies with fresh content in New Jersey.</p>
<p>"This launch is an important step for us, as the integration of our new RGS technology opens the door to a stellar line-up of premium casino content we have planned for release throughout the year and beyond," the executive noted. Matthew Sunderland, the SVP of iGaming at Caesars Digital, was similarly pleased to have this opportunity to extend the ongoing partnership with Bragg.</p>
<p>"The launch of new content from Bragg will further help us bring our customers in New Jersey a best-in-class iGaming experience," Sunderland added, noting that Bragg’s slot content was excellent, to begin with. At the beginning of the month, Bragg Gaming similarly expanded its partnership with DraftKings in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The supplier has also been growing its footprint in Michigan. In December, Bragg teamed up with BetMGM in the Great Lakes State.</p>
