    <h1>Best Casinos In Arizona Barton S Club 93 Casino Hotel Jackpot Mardi Gras Hotel Casino Casino Grand B</h1>

<p>On Monday, the company unveiled that it is expanding its casino products by delivering eight new games. The new content includes popular casino-style titles such as Baccarat, Blackjack, Roulette and more. Thanks to the expansion, customers of the company will be able to access different single-player table games.</p>
<p>Additionally, Rivalary confirmed it plans to add multiplayer as well as live dealer titles. These games are expected to deliver unique experiences while the company confirmed it plans to further expand its casino offering.</p>
<p>According to Rivalry, the eight new casino games will be available via the company’s casino platform that delivers unique experiences, Casino.exe. What’s more, the company vowed to continue to develop further the platform by implementing new features and introducing more games that are likely to appeal to the younger generations.</p>
<p>Last summer, Rivalry introduced its initial casino game portfolio. Then, in November, the company expanded further its casino games offering by adding four new titles. The positive impact of the new content was immediate, as the company reported a 30% betting handle and 15% in revenue for the third quarter of 2022 from the casino segment.</p>
<p>Rivalry confirmed that the expanded casino offering is available for online gambling markets where it operates under its license from the Isle of Man. Judging by its latest announcement, Rivalry plans to also roll out those titles in Ontario soon.</p>
<p>The Company Benefits from Expanding Casino Offering</p>
<p>Steven Salz, Rivalry’s co-founder and CEO, acknowledged that the casino games helped significantly diversify the company’s business. At the same time, he pointed out that the casino segment delivered additional revenue and softened the impact of seasonal sports. Salz predicted that by expanding its casino offering, Rivalry will further boost its revenue while delivering a number of engaging new games for its customers.</p>
<p>“Our entry into the casino segment last year has provided valuable diversification to the business, adding incremental revenue while reducing the impact of seasonality in sports betting, improving margin stability, and continuing to promote profitable customer unit economics.“ Steven Salz, co-founder and CEO at Rivalry</p>
<p>According to Rivalry’s CEO and co-founder, delivering unique experiences through innovation for its customer base is a top priority for the company. He added that Rivalry stands out from the competition by delivering a “curated, fun, and social experience.” Finally, Salz said that by standing out from traditional casino content by offering games such as multiplayer titles, Rivalry is able to tap into new markets and audiences.</p>
