    <h1>Grand Eagle Casino Buffalo Bills Casino Hotel Little River Casino Resort Manistee Mi El Dorado Casin</h1>

<p>Stake casino has operated in an extremely predatory manner. I had requested self exclusion and they willingly neglected account closure despite raising a issue about problem gambling.</p>
<p>Knowing that i had gambling issues the site let me further deposit for a span of a week. When confronting them again via Live chat, my account was instantly placed on Withdrawal Only mode.</p>
<p>If this action was taken immediately as soon as i had raised concerns and asked to close my account then this would not have occurred.</p>
<p>This is not the only problem I’ve experienced with Stake.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is no KYC procedure conducted, allowing me to deposit in excess of €14,933. How they are able to operate or even hold a license at this point is beyond belief.</p>
<p>Secondly, after repeatedly asked for account closure due to problems. The casino simply referred me to an internal account closure procedure. Which includes a 24 hour cool-off period, after-which a re-confirmation of account closure is required. Anyone thats raises concerns with their gambling should be prevented from further placing bets. However Stake has knowingly exploited me.</p>
<p>After numerous emails, they have no stopped replying to me and responded saying that account closure can only be done through the internal process. However, when asked for a reimbursement for a complete lack of due diligence, my account was immediately placed on withdrawal only mode. Which is strange because this simple action would have prevented myself from further deposits.</p>
<p>In summary, im seeking a reimbursement of €7,856.87. The calculations of deposits and withdrawals have been attached below.</p>
<p>I kindly ask Casino Guru to assist me in this complaint as the casino has knowingly put me at risk and are now not replying to my messages.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
