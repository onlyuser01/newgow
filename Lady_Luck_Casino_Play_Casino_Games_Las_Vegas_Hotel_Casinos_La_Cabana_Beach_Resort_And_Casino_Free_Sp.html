<p>Hann Casino Resort in the Clark Freeport Zone, Philippines is opening its doors today, according to an announcement by its developer, Hann Philippines Inc. This new plan involves the expansion and rebranding of the former Widus Hotel &amp; Casino complex through an investment of $238.3 million by Hann Philippines.</p>
<p>Clark Continues to Expand</p>
<p>In addition to the Hann Casino, the Clark location offers the Clark Marriott, Swissotel Clark and Swissotel Clark. Eventually, there will be a Mercure Hotel, as well.</p>
<p>Phase one of the resort was expected to be completed by the end of 2020. However, in October 2021, Widus Group, the promoter of the resort, stated that the launch was being delayed due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Daesik Han, the president and CEO of Hann Philippines, stated late last month that he hoped the property would attract investors and tourists to the region in order to help kickstart the Philippines’ economy and to revive the tourist industry.</p>
<p>COVID-19 Rules in Flux</p>
<p>According to the Philippine News Agency, the Philippines had originally planned to allow fully-vaccinated foreigners into the country between December 1 and 15.</p>
<p>It was announced that the Philippine task force responsible for COVID-19 response had “approved, in principle,” the entry by tourists from countries considered low risk of spreading infection. This was subject to the condition that these individuals are vaccinated.</p>
<p>That changed last month, though. The Philippine Department of Tourism stated that it supports a decision of the nation’s pandemic task team to temporarily ban entry to the Philippines of foreign tourists. This is due to safety and health concerns regarding the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Employees of the new resort undergo regular swab testing in order to detect COVID-19 infection. More than 90% of them are fully immunized against the disease, according to the company’s statement. Widus began a hiring spree a few months ago in anticipation of today’s soft launch.</p>
<p>Novel Design Concepts Added to Resort</p>
<p>Aedas Interiors Limited Hong Kong designed the resort. This firm is also responsible for the Langham in Shenzhen and the Hong Kong International Airport Midfield Concourse. The resort features minimalist, clean lines and geometric forms that evoke various layers found in nature.</p>
<p>Alan Hamilton, Director at Aedas Interiors Limited HK, stated that “Integrating Clark’s tropical forests and famous mountain landscapes into the development’s interiors keep Hann Casino close to the heart of the locals, as well as creating a refreshing experience for foreign guests,”</p>
<p>Hann Group stated that FSC Chain of Custody-certified materials were used to decorate these areas. This means that the forest-to-building material path was traced and verified. Meanwhile, Singapore Green Building Product-certified paint is green-certified and sustainable.</p>
<p>The company stated that Hann Casino’s use of these products will result in less waste, lower energy consumption and less environmental impact.</p>
