    <h1>Elwha River Casino Apache Gold Casino Winport Casino Omaha Casino Casino Resort Hotels Cosmo Casino</h1>

<p>The casino must return funds to a method that was used to deposit, and it is your responsibility to choose your PMOP when you make a withdrawal. You used skrill to deposit some time ago, and your deposit was returned to that skrill account because it is the default PMOP if you do not choose a different one. I can only see part of the email that is on the skrill account and it is almost the same as the email on your casino account, however i am not able to post it here. At the time your withdrawal was sent, german players were still able to receive withdrawals via skrill. Unfortunately since we no longer have that ability, there doesn't seem to be anything i can do.</p>
<p>I can see 2 emails you've sent in the last 2 days where you have made a sarcastic comment then said you are still waiting for your 100 EUR. Then the next email just says "this is my email address" with an address that is not linked to your account. All emails you've sent since the withdrawal have been the same, and from an email address noone would be able to link to your account.</p>
<p>There is no account number and you're emailing from an email that is not linked to your account. Unfortunately our support staff are highly understaffed, they are not mind readers nor do they have access to these complaints, so you need to give them information to find your account, and tell them what the issue is.</p>
<p>Please send an email with your account number, from the email address on your casino account, stating that you have not received your withdrawal and would like a confirmation number or more information. You can send this to payments@casinorewards.com</p>
<p>Unfortunately since you have different details here compared to your casino account I cannot post anything here that would make me break security rules.</p>
<p>The withdrawal was sent to the method on your account. The casino has satisfied their obligations.</p>
