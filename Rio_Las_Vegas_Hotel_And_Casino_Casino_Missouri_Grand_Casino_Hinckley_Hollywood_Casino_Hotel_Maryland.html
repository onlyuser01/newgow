<p>Chvátal will be succeeded as CEO of Allwyn UK by the experienced Andria Vidler who will assume office on October 1</p>
<p>Allwyn’s UK business will be led by a new CEO, as announced by the company. The company’s interim UK CEO Robert Chvátal will step down from his position to return to his usual duties as CEO of the group.</p>
<p>Chvátal will be succeeded by the experienced Andria Vidler who will assume office on October 1. In her new position, she will be responsible for Allwyn’s pending takeover of the UK’s National Lottery. The Czech operator is set to assume responsibilities for Britain’s largest lottery in February 2024.</p>
<p>Before being selected as the CEO of Allwyn UK, Vidler served as Tag Worldwide’s chief executive officer for the EMEA region. Prior to that, she served as the CEO of Centaur Media.</p>
<p>As operator of the National Lottery, Allwyn will be responsible for generating more money for good causes, much like Camelot, its predecessor.</p>
<p>At first, Camelot, the incumbent National Lottery operator, was opposed to the UKGC’s decision to select Allwyn as its successor. After a few months of conflict, which CEO Chvátal confidently braved, Camelot conceded, allowing the regulator to crown Allwyn as the next National Lottery operator.</p>
<p>Allwyn eventually acquired Camelot, ending the two companies’ hostilities for good.</p>
<p>Vidler Will Be a “Fantastic Asset” to the Company</p>
<p>Vidler commented on her new appointment, saying that she is very excited to join Allwyn. The hire said that serving the National Lottery and making sure that it continues to deliver benefits to society is a task that resonates with her.</p>
<p>The upcoming CEO concluded that she is looking forward to working with Allwyn’s and Camelot’s teams.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to get to work alongside partners and colleagues from across our Allwyn and Camelot teams to make this vision a reality. Andria Vidler, CEO appointee, Allwyn UK</p>
<p>Justin King, Allwyn UK’s chair, welcomed Vidler on board, praising her extensive experience in growing entertainment brands and helping them “adapt to the realities and opportunities of a data-enabled multichannel landscape.” He is certain that Vidler will be a great addition to Allwyn’s team and a “fantastic asset” to the National Lottery.</p>
<p>Robert Chvátal, Allwyn’s CEO, shared that he feels that he is leaving Allwyn UK in good hands.</p>
<p>Andria’s experience of developing and managing compelling brands, content and campaigns that connect with audiences in a fast-changing digital environment made her the ideal choice for our new CEO. Robert Chvátal, CEO, Allwyn</p>
<p>Chvátal concluded that Vidler will be able to draw on Allwyn’s UK talents while also taking advantage of the reliable Allwyn Group platform.</p>
