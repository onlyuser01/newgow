<p>The Raiders Stars Need to Start Shining</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Raiders are one of the most disappointing teams in the NFL this season. After capturing the signature of wide receiver Davante Adams in the offseason, fans were expecting them to cruise to the playoffs. However, 10 weeks into the 2022 NFL season, the Raiders are 2-7.</p>
<p>Their chances of making the playoffs dropped to 1%, following last week’s home loss to the Indianapolis Colts. The final score was 25-20 for the visitors, even though the team from Nevada had a lead at one point in the final quarter.</p>
<p>Their offense did a decent job that day, with quarterback Derek Carr going 24 for 38 for 248 passing yards and two touchdowns. One of those TD throws was caught by Davante Adams, who also added 129 receiving yards to his team’s tally.</p>
<p>The Raiders defense, on the other hand, was horrendous against the Colts. For instance, we saw them failing to do anything to stop Jonathan Taylor’s 66-yard TD run. Their passing defense also failed to stop Parris Campbell from catching a 35-yard throw.</p>
<p>The Broncos Aren’t Much Better Either</p>
<p>Unlike the Raiders whose defense is to blame for most of their losses, the Broncos fans need to be upset with the offensive team. With 14.6 points per game, they have the least productive offense in the entire league.</p>
<p>Ranking 32nd wouldn’t be such a shock if they didn’t have Russell Wilson in the QB position. The man who’s going to earn almost $300 million during his stay in Denver, has been nothing short of disappointing in 2022.</p>
<p>With him as the quarterback, the Broncos scored more than 20 points per game only once this season. It happened three weeks ago when they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 21-17 in a London game. What’s important to note is that Wilson was responsible for only one of the TDs Denver scored in that game – the other two were rushing touchdowns.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Raiders vs Denver Broncos Prediction</p>
<p>Despite their disappointing record in 2022, the Raiders do have a decent roster. This goes especially for their offensive team. That said, we expect them to do well enough on Sunday to beat their AFC West rivals.</p>
