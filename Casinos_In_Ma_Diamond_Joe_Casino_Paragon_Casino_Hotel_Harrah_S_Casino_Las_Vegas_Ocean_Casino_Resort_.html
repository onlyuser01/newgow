<p>As part of a new deal negotiated between the tribal gaming operator and the company, Anaxi has introduced the Mobile on-Premise solution which will allow casino guests who are playing on trust lands to enjoy Aristocrat Class II gaming machines via mobile devices.</p>
<p>New Mobile Solution Enables Class II Gambling on Trust Lands</p>
<p>This is a prelude to online casino gambling, although in a rather limited capacity that requires more tailored geofencing to be successful.</p>
<p>Anaxi, which operates under the Aristocrat roof, has been an established provider of digital products and has been working on both expanding the group’s iGaming presence but also on driving synergies with existing physical businesses that already work with Aristocrat.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest opportunity, Anaxi SVP of iGaming Product &amp; Technology Josh Morris said that the partnership was groundbreaking, and it was an arrangement of that type that would drive the company and the industry forward. The Mobile on-Premise solution is a forward-thinking experience that is designed to elevate the gambling experience at tribal gaming operators and beyond.</p>
<p>“We also thank our integration partners that have been part of this journey, helping to deliver this innovation solution,” Morris added.</p>
<p>The partnership sees the WinStar World Casino and Resort in Oklahoma, the biggest casino resort property in the world, benefit through the introduction of Class II games. Anaxi and WinStar also want to make sure that this collaboration is ongoing and that Anaxi’s platform continues to inject fresh content that allows players to get even more value with each visit.</p>
<p>The arrangement was welcomed by Chickasaw Nation Secretary of Commerce Dan Boren who was equally excited about the opportunity.</p>
<p>“The approval last year by the National Indian Gaming for alternate technical standards for the Chickasaw Nation Office of the Gaming Commissioners applicable to Class II mobile gaming provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of modern technology,” Boren explained.</p>
<p>Mobile Is the Future of Gambling, Land-Based and Otherwise</p>
<p>He also said that mobile gaming is one of the technologies that will continue to shape the future of gaming. The opportunity to introduce it to the WinStar casino and guests is just a first step in what Boren hopes will be a long and successful partnership with the innovative gaming operator.</p>
<p>Anaxi has been actively expanding its portfolio of partners over the past weeks, with the company teaming up with PENN Interactive and strengthening its iGaming brands. The company has similarly teamed up with Caesars and FanDuel, establishing its foothold in the North American market and the United States in particular.</p>
