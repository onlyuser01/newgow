<p>The visitation figures show that the region is on track to reach its 2023 target of 3.5 million visitors</p>
<p>The Primorye Gambling Area in Russia reported that tourism is experiencing a slight recovery although foreign tourism is yet to fully pick up. Despite that, the visitation figures far outclassed those recorded in 2022, attesting to the region’s post-COVID recovery.</p>
<p>The Gambling Area is located in Russia’s Primorsky Krai, a coastal territory in the Far Eastern Federal District. During the first nine months of the year, the region’s Primorye Gambling Area welcomed some 3.1 million visitors, which represents a 16% year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>The zone’s tourism agency added that an overwhelming majority of these people (2 million) have arrived in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The zone is still to reach the level of international appeal the Primorsky Krai hopes it to as only 56,000 of the tourists were foreigners. While this figure may seem underwhelming at first glance, it should be noted that this number is still 10 times higher than the one recorded during the prior year period.</p>
<p>While foreign visitation is on the rise, experts believe that it will continue to be impeded by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the multiple sanctions and restrictions imposed on Russia.</p>
<p>Primorye Gambling Area on Track to Hitting 2023 Visitation Targets</p>
<p>In any case, the visitation figures are slowly returning to their pre-pandemic state. For reference, the Primorye Gambling Area welcomed 5 million people in 2019 and 4.5 million in 2018.</p>
<p>The visitation figures reported by the tourism agency show that the region is on track to reach its 2023 target of 3.5 million visitors. This would be 500,000 people more than those recorded in 2022.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Russia continues to develop the Primorye Gambling Area, hoping to further bolster its appeal. The zone seeks to capitalize on the thirst for gambling in the region by providing premium casino Gambling.</p>
<p>As of the time of this writing, the location sports two casinos, notably Tigre de Cristal and Shambala. The Primorye Gambling Area is set to have more casinos but the war in Ukraine caused setbacks that led to the suspension of NagaCorp’s casino project in the region. In the meantime, Asia-Invest Group is currently working on another casino property.</p>
<p>The final version of the Gambling Area should have around a dozen casino hotels, shopping centers, exhibition galleries and Gambling centers.</p>
