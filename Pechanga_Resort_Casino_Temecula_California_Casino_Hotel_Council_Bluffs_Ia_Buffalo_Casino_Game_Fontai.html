<p>One William Hill user enjoyed a massive windfall on a simple bet this past weekend. A simple accumulator bet, or parlay, hit all of its segments, turning £1 into £28,000.</p>

<p>A William Hill bettor scored a huge payday this past weekend, according to The Sun. The unnamed individual wagered £1 (US$1.31) and turned it into £28,000 (US$36,654). That makes it one of the most successful bets of the weekend.</p>
<p>The bettor chose seven soccer games from around Europe, each with distinct odds of winning. Not until the last game concluded could the individual begin to celebrate. But there were over 28,000 reasons to jump for joy.</p>
<p>It was quite a weekend for a couple of our customers, as a bit of luck mixed with some great judgement saw them each scoop a big pot,” stated William Hill spokesperson Tony Kenny.</p>
<p>Another unidentified person added 16 matches to their parlay ticket, selecting games from around Europe. When the final whistle blew in the last game on the slip, it was time to celebrate. £5 (US$6.55) had become £25,000 (US$32,727).</p>
<p>In the US, they’re called parlay bets. In Europe, they’re known as accumulators. Either way, the objective is to combine multiple betting options, such as the moneyline of different games, into a single bet. If all components win, the bet pays. If just one fails, the entire bet falls apart.</p>
<p>Debunking Sports Betting Myths</p>
<p>There’s plenty of discussion about the pros and cons of legal sports betting. The dividing line and who stands on which side are highly visible.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that more than 61% of bettors consider sports betting nothing more than entertainment. They’re in it for the thrill. 51% enjoy it for the challenge.</p>
<p>Sports betting isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme, and seasoned bettors know this. However, it is possible to make sports betting profitable. It requires developing skill and experience and maintaining a level head like virtually anything.</p>
<p>Multiple studies worldwide show varying degrees of gambling addiction, or “problem gambling.” Still, in almost all cases, the level is under 5%. In the UK and the US, the percentage is less than 4%. In Australia, it’s less than 2%. In Spain, the figure is under 1%.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Nets Billions</p>
<p>The global gambling market relies heavily on sports betting. The segment is responsible for around 30-40% of the entire industry, according to Statista.</p>
<p>The sports betting industry will be worth as much as $93 billion within a year. That’s $34 billion more than where it was three years ago.</p>
