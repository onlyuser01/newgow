    <h1>Foxwoods Casino Restaurants Best Casino In Kansas City Stratosphere Hotel Casino Las Vegas Free Casi</h1>

<p>The company’s latest partnership comes from Slovakia where the supplier has teamed up with local brand Kajot and has now deployed its portfolio of top-performing games. This tie-up is exclusively signed with the operator, giving it the opportunity to quickly differentiate its offer and position itself strongly in the market.</p>
<p>Commenting on this business opportunity, CT Interactive head of business development EMEA Milena Tsankarska said that the supplier was very happy to bring its top-notch slot games once again to a brand-new operator with an established reputation.</p>
<p>Games such as Cherry Crown, 20 Star Party, and Coffee Magic, among many others, will all make players happier. Tsankarska spoke highly of Kajot’s geographical reach as well, arguing that more content link-up would follow from there on out.</p>
<p>“This partnership with such a renowned gaming operator will help us increase our visibility in the European iGaming scene,” she concluded, noting that Kajot is a brand with more than 27 years of operating experience in Europe.</p>
<p>Kajot head of online casino Stanislav Šebest was similarly excited to see the CT Interactive products arrive on the market and give local players the best possible chance to engage and enjoy with its players better. The goal, said Šebest, is to ensure that the casino is able to reach a wider audience and engage with it meaningfully.</p>
<p>CT Interactive is a fairly new entry into the Slovakian iGaming market, obtaining its license in 2022. However, there has been a very strong reception and uptake of the company’s games in that geography, said CT Interactive head of CRM Silvia Hristova.</p>
<p>CT Interactive has been relentlessly expanding its content footprint, having recently teamed up with Sbbet.me in Montenegro and ELITBET in Bulgaria. The supplier offers more than 100 quality games that are designed to elevate the consumer experience. In the meantime, the company has been driving steady forays into new markets, including Italy, which is one of the most tightly regulated ones, as well as Georgia.</p>
