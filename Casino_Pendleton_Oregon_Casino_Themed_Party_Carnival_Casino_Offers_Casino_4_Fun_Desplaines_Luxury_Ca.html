    <h1>Casino Pendleton Oregon Casino Themed Party Carnival Casino Offers Casino 4 Fun Desplaines Luxury Ca</h1>

<p>here is when it first happened I was so upset as for months I played 777builder and was so high it was over 10k for 4 dollar bet each bet moves the money that when it comes down it moves it up for a higher bet</p>
<p>here is my email to them</p>
<p>have to say after a number of years playing with your casino never have I felt so dumbfounded with what has happened in the last two weeks It is very scary to know that my Uk account was stripped from me I had achievements on that game you're aware of over 10,000 to eventually come down as I worked all summer achieving that game to the level never would I dreamed you would take it out from under me and put another one to replace it with nothing of play That to me shows me that you guys cannot be trusted I am beyond upset with this as I could have had bets in play with Uk but no just one day it's not UK but LUXURY CASINO THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN SAY TO ME THAT WOULD EXPLAIN STEALING MY ACCHEVMENTS AND TAKING MY CASINO UK AND REPLACING WITH THIS OTHR ONE TO ME THAT IS NOT ONLY HURTFUL BUT MY TRUST IS GONE ..My casino classic is still there but no it had to be UK where my 777builder was of course so now moving forward I have now started playing a casino that gives winnings within 1 hour and I am beyond disappointed That I wasted months achieving this level to the game 777 and knowing that it might take another week or months or hours but that money would have come down just like the game that I played for weeks chicken cluck game that did come down at 7,000 so you see I cannot trust you guys and the chat disregards my inquiry making light of this situation it is not something that is allowed to take a game away and start it from scratch TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN I WOULD HIGHLY ADVISE TO PUT MY GAME 777BUILDER BACK ON WITH ALL MY ACCHEIVEMNTS YOU HAVE LSOT A GOOD PLAYER OTHERWISE</p>

<p>Hello P<strong>*</strong>*,</p>
<p>Thank you for email and apologies about our live chat not being able to help you resolve this query.</p>
<p>I've had a look at your game session and transaction number which you can review in your Game History.</p>
<p>I can confirm the payout was credited to your balance when the bet got stuck on 03/11, and when you were able to access the game again on 08/11 the game was just displaying the winnings that were previously added.</p>
<p>The original Session number you have to look for is 7227739 and the Transaction Number is 243. There you can see the total Payout was $247.50 and your closing balance $420.72. With that balance you moved on to the game Cash Printer Heist and placed a $5 bet brining your total balane to $415.72.</p>
<p>To review this session you have to navigate to the date 03/11/2022 (in your Game History it is displayed as 11/03/2022). Make sure to click on "Show Detailed Statement" at the top once you open the session to be able to see all transactions.</p>
<p>Below you can find detailed instructions on how to access and navigate your Game History:</p>
<p>Game History is a tool within the casino that records every bet and transaction you made on your casino account during the last 100 days. Every time you enter your casino account a new session number will be recorded and every time you make a bet, redeem bonus, make a deposit or a withdrawal a unique transaction number records the transaction. This allows you to check every bet you made and the result of this bet.</p>
<p>If you could be so kind as to access Game History through your casino account, you will be able to find the session and the transaction, which will allow us to verify your request and forward these details to Microgaming for further investigation if necessary.</p>
<p>For the easiest way to access your Game History on your device, please follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log in to your casino account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the little icon of the person in the top right hand corner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on ‘Game History’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the ‘Time Frame’ of the game session you are looking for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on ‘Go'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the Session you want to open and click 'View'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select 'View Detailed Statement'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the Transaction number and click"'View'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is anything more I can do for you, please let me know.</p>
