<p>Dear Christian,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Casino Guru and letting us help you with your issue. According to your answers in our questionnaire, it seems you played with the 5€ no deposit bonus. I took a closer look at the Bonus T&amp;Cs and found a term stating the following: "You must make a minimum deposit of 10€ in order to withdraw any cash winnings."</p>
<p>Moreover, there is also a maximum pay-out rule: "The maximum allowed withdrawal amount for this bonus is 100€."</p>
<p>If you didn’t make a deposit after the wagering was finished, the winnings from the bonus weren’t added to your cash balance. It remained in your bonus balance and as you kept wagering, the maximum bet rule was breached. This is probably the reason why the casino cancelled your withdrawal. I’m afraid that if this is the case, there is not much we can do. I’m sorry; I wish I could be of more help.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Peter</p>
