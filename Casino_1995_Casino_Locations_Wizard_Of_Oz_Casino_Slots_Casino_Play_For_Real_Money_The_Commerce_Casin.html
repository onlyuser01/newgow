<p>The betting odds for the Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings Week 3 game suggest the home team is going to win comfortably. At some betting sites, Minnesota is a 7-point favorite against Detroit. The reason why this seems strange is that both teams have a 1-1 record in 2022, with the Lions putting on much better performances than the Vikings.</p>
<p>The reason why bookmakers think the Vikings are going to win is that the Lions were the worst NFL team last season when they finished with a 3-13-1 record.</p>

<p>Detroit Lions Offense is (Surprisingly) Good in 2022</p>
<p>Last season, the Detroit Lions scored a total of 325 points in 17 games, which accounts for 19.11 points per game on average. After two weeks of the 2022 NFL season, their scoring average is 35.5. With 71 points scored in total, The Lions have the most productive offense in the National Football Conference (NFC).</p>
<p>The most surprising thing about Detroit’s offensive display is that the Lions did play against some pretty tough defenses. In Week 1, they scored 35 points against the Philadelphia Eagles – the team that held the Minnesota Vikings to just seven points in Week 2.</p>
<p>In their second game of the 2022 season, the Lions scored 36 points against the Washington Commanders. The game saw a fantastic collaboration between quarterback Jared Goff and wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown – the WR caught two TD passes in that game. The Lions were also terrific running-wise, with three rushing touchdowns scored.</p>
<p>Minnesota Vikings Offense Needs to Do Better</p>
<p>Minnesota’s quarterback Kirk Cousins had a fantastic game in Week 1 when he threw 23/32 for 277 yards and two touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers. It was a whole different story in Week 2. The Vikings lost 24-7 to the Eagles, with Cousins going 27/46 for 221 yards and one touchdown. The worst thing is that three of his throws ended up intercepted by Philly’s defense.</p>
<p>Cousins and his teammates will have to do better in the offense in Week 3. Luckily for them, they’re locking horns with one of the worst defenses in the league. The Lions have conceded 65 points so far, which is more than any other team in the NFL in the 2022 season.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions vs Minnesota Vikings Prediction</p>
<p>We expect to see both teams do great in the offense. Their defensive performance is what’s probably going to decide the winner of the game. So, which team will do better defensively? Judging by what we’ve seen from these two in 2022, the answer is Minnesota.</p>
<p>Picks: Minnesota Vikings to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
