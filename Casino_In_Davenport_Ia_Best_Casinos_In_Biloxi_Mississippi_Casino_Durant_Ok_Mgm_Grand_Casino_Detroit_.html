<p>Globally recognized Unibet brand which is a part of Kindred Group, a leading online gambling operator, announced a new partnership with the National Hockey League (NHL). Under the terms of the new multi-year agreement, announced Tuesday, Unibet was designated as NHL's Official Partner in Sweden.</p>
<p>The new partnership marks the first Swedish betting company to become an Official Partner of the League. Per the terms of the new deal, Unibet gains access to unique marketing rights of the NHL. This, in turn, enables the brand to create customized and engaging content and experiences for its customers.</p>
<p>Moreover, as an Official Partner of NHL in Sweden, Unibet will leverage this status to develop engaging digital offerings and dynamic marketing campaigns. Thanks to the new collaboration, the brand will also strengthen its ice hockey offering and deliver engaging features for its customers.</p>
<p>John Lewicki, NHL's Vice President, Business Development and Partnerships, commented about the recent partnership in a statement released on February 7, 2023, saying: "We are excited to have Unibet as an Official Partner of the NHL."</p>
<p>He outlined that Kindred and its brands are recognized for their efforts and dedication to responsible gambling. Finally, Lewicki said: "We welcome this opportunity to work with Unibet to continue to engage our robust and expanding hockey fanbase in Sweden."</p>
<p>According to Kindred, the new partnership with the NHL will be supported by the League's Official Betting Data Rights Partner, Sportradar. Currently, the NHL is using Sportradar's data-driven marketing solution called ad:s which delivers marketing services to boost the growth of sports betting deals inked by the League outside of North America.</p>
<p>Philip Lagström, Kindred Group's Country Manager Unibet Sweden, added: "I am very proud and happy that Unibet is the first betting company in Sweden to become an official sponsor of NHL." He said the company hopes that this new collaboration will help boost interest in the NHL and ice hockey as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, Lagström said: "It will be very exciting to follow NHL in the upcoming years." He explained that both the NHL and ice hockey are important segments within Unibet's operations. Finally, Lagström said that becoming the go-to provider of secure, safe and exciting gaming experiences for ice hockey fans and bettors alike was a long-term goal for the company.</p>
<p>The new partnership comes on the heels of another announcement by Kindred. Earlier this week, the company confirmed that for the fourth quarter of 2022, its revenue from high-risk players decreased. In Q3, 2022, the revenue from problem gambling was 3.8%, but in Q4, it decreased to 3.3%. This achievement complements Kindred's ambitious goal to achieve zero revenue from problem gambling by the end of this year.</p>
