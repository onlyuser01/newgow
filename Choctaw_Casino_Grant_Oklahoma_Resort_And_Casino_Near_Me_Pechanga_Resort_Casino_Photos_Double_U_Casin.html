<p>The popular and fast-growing digital entertainment supplier, Playson, expanded further its presence within the iGaming vertical by announcing the release of a new promotional tool. The company confirmed on Thursday it launched its newest promotional tool called Short Races.</p>
<p>The new launch seeks to propel Playson within the online gambling realm. At the same time, the company explained that the new tool is designed in a way to engage with modern players, considering it seeks to capture their "shorter attention span."</p>
<p>Mihai Dumitrescu, Playson's Promotions Manager, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "We are always looking for new ways to innovate new and exciting products at Playson, which is why I’m thrilled to announce the launch of our Short Races feature." Finally, he explained: "This will help operators boost engagement while offering a new experience for our players."</p>
<p>The new tool was described by Playson as a "fast-paced standalone promo feature." The unique feature stands out by offering "quick-fire competitions" within different Playson games. This, in turn, delivers new experiences for the customers while at the same time boosting fan engagement.</p>
<p>"Playson’s latest product includes highly motivating prize pools, bigger chances of being placed at the top of the leaderboard and a fresh experience that differs from regular slot tournaments," explained the company. Additionally, it said that the operators can customize those tournaments by changing the duration, as well as the amount of the prize.</p>
<p>The operators can also benefit from other customizations. They can set individual requirements for a specific number of days, as well as other incentives. Ultimately, those options help deliver new and engaging products that also allow the operators to tap into new audiences. It's important to mention that the solution doesn't need additional integration, which reaffirms its scalability and enables partner operators to benefit from higher player engagement thanks to fast deployment.</p>
<p>Ganna Guseva, Playson's Product Owner for Promotional Tools, said: "We’re delighted to reveal this exciting new tool to our partners and players. The Short Races feature will introduce a unique way for players to experience Playson slots, with the knowledge they could win big prizes in a shorter period of time."</p>
<p>She added that the new Short Races tool seeks to tap into a generation of players that have a shorter attention span while delivering entertaining and unique experiences. Finally, Guseva said: "We worked closely with our operator partners when developing the feature, and firmly believe it will address the challenge that many online casinos currently face in maintaining the interest of modern day slot players."</p>
