<p>Keith Wall has stepped in the position of strategic advisor for SB22 at a time of pivotal changes in the regulated gambling market</p>
<p>Keith Wall previously worked as VP of sports betting commercial with FanDuel and brings along more than 15 years of industry-related experience. Wall was excited at the new opportunity to join SB22’s ranks and strengthen the company’s expertise in the sports gambling sector.</p>

<p>He assured that SB22 was already showing strong signs of growth and doing the right thing, despite the company being a relatively new arrival to the regulated betting space. Wall hailed SB22’s commitment to innovation and the fact that it was already able to deliver industry-first solutions across the board.</p>
<p>“I’m really looking forward to being a part of such a seasoned group of talented people who are clearly taking SB22 to major player status in this dynamic industry,” Wall said in an official statement commenting on the appointment and his role within the company moving forward.</p>
<p>SB22 remains committed to significantly expanding its reach and clout both in the US market and internationally. SB22 CCO Vik Shrestha welcomed the arrival of Wall as an important addition to the team. Shrestha called Wall a good friend who just so happened to be an extraordinary fixture in the gambling industry and bring along with him a trove of experience.</p>
<p>His global experience and demonstrable track record of success will prove invaluable as we grow and expand our business. SB22 CCO Vik Shrestha</p>
<p>SB COO Vladimir Jovanovic was similarly pleased with the opportunity to bring Wall on board. He said that he had worked with him over the years and saw the successful launch of numerous sports betting operations guided by the man, which was what made him a good fit for SB22 as well. “He is a fantastic addition to our team,” Jovanovic concluded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SB22 remains just as prominent in betting markets. The company has a GLI33 certification for its omnichannel platform which features both powerful betting solutions along with excellent promotional capabilities.</p>
