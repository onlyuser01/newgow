<p>On Friday, Rush Street Interactive and Century Casinos inked a partnership agreement to launch BetRivers.com in West Virginia in 2021.</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive (RSI) and Century Casinos announced Friday they have partnered to launch online casino gaming in West Virginia next year.</p>
<p>RSI, Rush Street Gaming’s online division, said it plans to launch its website BetRivers.com in the state in the second quarter of 2021, pending regulatory approval and licensing from the West Virginia Lottery.</p>
<p>The company’s president, Richard Schwartz, stated in a news release that RSI is “the clear leader in online casino market share” in West Virginia’s neighboring state Pennsylvania, thanks to the operator’s “secure and reliable platform“, as well as its focus on player experience, transparency, and a large and innovative portfolio, Mr. Schwartz said.</p>
<p>“In partnership with Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack &amp; Resort, we are pleased to have the chance to offer gaming fans in West Virginia the unparalleled experience and service our customers have come to expect via BetRivers.com.” Richard Schwartz, RSI President</p>
<p>Under its brands BetRivers.com and PlaySugarHouse.com, RSI currently offers online casinos and sportsbooks in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The company operates online sports betting platforms in four other states, including Illinois, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa.</p>
<p>Fourth State to Offer Online Casino Gaming</p>
<p>Last summer, West Virginia became the fourth US state to launch online casino offerings via the launch of DraftKings and partner Hollywood Casino in Charles Town‘s mobile gaming offering on July 16.</p>
<p>West Virginia joined Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware to offer online casino gaming. In addition to Nevada, online poker is also available in those states.</p>
<p>In November, the state’s iGaming activities generated $2.1 million in revenue, a 30.3% jump from the previous month’s $1.6 million. November’s handle stands at $72.6 million, up 36.6% from October’s $53.1 million.</p>
<p>Mid-September, renowned online slot game developer NetEnt announced it will enter the West Virginia market through its partnership with leading iGaming and sportsbook BetMGM.</p>
<p>Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) launched its sportsbook and online casino in the Mountain State in November through a deal with the Greenbrier Hotel Corporation.</p>
<p>Century Casinos Temporarily Closes Canadian Properties</p>
<p>Due to the Alberta government’s recent measures to minimize the spread of Covid–19, Century Casinos announced last Wednesday the temporary shutdown of all its Canadian properties, including casinos and racetracks. The government is expected to consider the situation in four weeks and possibly lift the regulations.</p>
<p>Century Casinos owns multiple casinos in Alberta, Canada, and the US, such as the Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack &amp; Resort in New Cumberland, West Virginia, as well as properties in Colorado and Missouri.</p>
