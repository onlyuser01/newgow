<p>The leading sports betting and digital gaming company, BetMGM, announced Thursday that it inked a deal with A.J. Andrews, the American professional softball player.</p>
<p>AJ Joins BetMGM’s Family of Ambassadors</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, Andrews will serve as BetMGM’s newest content creator and brand ambassador. The collaboration will see the famous athlete appear on behalf of BetMGM for multiple broadcasting opportunities related to the upcoming baseball season. Moreover, Andrews will participate in fun events and social media content.</p>
<p>“A.J. is an all-around powerhouse who has been a trailblazer in sports throughout her career.” Matt Prevost, chief revenue officer at BetMGM</p>
<p>BetMGM’s chief revenue officer, Matt Prevost, shared his excitement about the recent collaboration. He revealed that the company is proud to welcome Andrews to its team. Andrews thanked BetMGM for the opportunity to add to the brand’s profile and awareness and shared his own passion for sports.</p>
<p>“I am so grateful for the opportunity,” Andrews said. Her chief goal as part of the team will be to also advertise for more women to get involved in sports, using BetMGM’s platform to share and inspire others.</p>
<p>Andrews is currently working with not-for-profit organizations to help young women gain the confidence they need to succeed in life. She is currently with the Chicago Bandits, a professional softball team. Andrews was the first woman to win the Rawlings Gold Glove Award.</p>
<p>Empowering Women and Female Athletes</p>
<p>Women have been part of athletic contests in the United States for many years now, not least through the successes of the national soccer team that advertised for equal pay in the sport between men and women, and even cited women’s more successful track record.</p>
<p>Andrews’ reputation and accomplishments continue to grow as she also won the Rally Spike Award and was featured in ESPN Magazine’s The Body Issue. She has also hosted a number of shows, including the Unapologetic: The Black Female Athlete,” MLBN’s “Play Ball,” and she is also recognized for her powerful motivational speeches through the empowHer project.</p>
