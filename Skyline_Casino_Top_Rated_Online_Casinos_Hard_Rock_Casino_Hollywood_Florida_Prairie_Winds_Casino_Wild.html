<p>Information about Thunderkick casinos</p>
<p>If you're looking for a great casino with Thunderkick games to play, you're in the right place. Our Thunderkick casino list is tailor-made to help you find the best casinos for you.</p>
<p>Thunderkick are known to deliver original, high-quality games, and like to stand out from the crowd when it comes to their competitors. On this page, we're going to take a closer look at Thunderkick and their games, as well as how to choose the right Thunderkick casino.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>A Scandinavian provider with a strong NetEnt influence</p>
<p>You've probably heard of NetEnt: after all, they're one of the most prominent providers out there, and this is reflected by the large number of NetEnt casinos on our site that feature their games.</p>
<p>Well, Thunderkick was founded by a breakaway pair of their developers in 2012. Based in Stockholm, they sought to use their wealth of experience to hit the market with their own ideas, which resulted in brand new Thunderkick casino games.</p>
<p>Today, they've spawned into a team of over 50 people, and their mission is to do things in their own way in an 'industry ruled by giants'.</p>
<p>But is this independent streak evident in their software and games? Let's take a look.</p>
<p>An innovative approach to casino games</p>
<p>One thing that sets Thunderkick apart is their willingness to try new things. They love to combine different tools to create original games, and have gained a reputation for showing innovation.</p>
<p>To start with, their games seem to jump out of the page at you when you scroll down their list of titles. They use engaging titles, such as Magicious and Flame Busters, to catch your eye, and their bold, colorful designs make it very tempting for you to click 'play game' and get spinning.</p>
<p>This bright aesthetic is backed up by an excellent real-time 3D Unity engine, which gives you some unique visual effects, such as a moving background.</p>
<p>Note: Turning Totems is a great example of this, with a series of native American totems turning on the spot instead of the traditional reel layout</p>
<p>They're also supremely skilled at using smart sound effects to keep the player's attention and their clever storylines wrap the whole thing up into a superb game-playing bundle.</p>
<p>The games are delivered in the HTML5 format, meaning they're super flexible and can be played on pretty much any device that you own.</p>
<p>With relatively few games, it appears that Thunderkick prefer quality over quantity and put a lot of time and effort into producing top-class games.</p>
<p>How to find the best Thunderkick casino for you</p>
<p>Thunderkick games are known for their superb gameplay and great aesthetic, so it would be a shame if you were conned into playing one in an unscrupulous casino. Unfortunately, this does sometimes happen, with dishonest casinos trying to trick people and using unfair practices to increase their profits.</p>
<p>This is where our list and casino reviews come in handy. Our team of reviewers have spent a lot of time reviewing all Thunderkick casinos and compiling this list to help you find the most suitable option.</p>
<p>To make sure your Thunderkick casino is authentic, use our list of Thunderkick casinos and select the 'Recommended' tab. Here, you'll get a selection of suitable casinos that are safe for you to play on in 2020.</p>
<p>You can also browse a list of new Thunderkick casinos by simply selecting the 'New' tab. These will be the hot new things on the scene, and could be the best choice for you if you are looking for something fresh.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can just click the 'All' tab to have the full list at your disposal and play to your heart's content.</p>
<p>If you're still feeling a little lost in all this, then feel free to check out our How to choose an online casino article, which will guide you towards choosing a great casino.</p>
<p>Thunderkick Casino Bonuses</p>
<p>One last thing we should mention: bonuses, such as those of the 'no-deposit' and 'first deposit' variety, can be utilised in a number of Thunderkick casinos on the list.</p>
<p>You can use the Thunderkick filter on our list of casino bonuses to do this. Again, these can be cut down to different categories to find the bonus of your choice. The page is continuously updated by our Casino Guru team so you'll always get relevant options.</p>
