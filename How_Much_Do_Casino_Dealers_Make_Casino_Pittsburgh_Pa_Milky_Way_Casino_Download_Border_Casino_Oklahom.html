    <h1>How Much Do Casino Dealers Make Casino Pittsburgh Pa Milky Way Casino Download Border Casino Oklahom</h1>

<p>Never ever I encounter a casino like this.</p>
<p>i managed to win 2600 euro and they took everything away.</p>
<p>i Noticed that small amount of money was adding up but the main money was earned by my bets on the french roulette on the netEnt.</p>
<p>they had this comp points do for me it was like a bonus.</p>
<p>when I did the kyc, they took all the money and gave me a bonus of 100 instead.</p>
<p>the reason was that money was earned due to a technical issue of the comp points</p>
<p>they could explained why exactly.</p>
<p>i started to play with the 100 euro ans d I earned another 500 euro.</p>
<p>they locked my account and told me that was a technical issue on my account and it will be resolved within 48 hours.</p>
<p>since then they changed the issue. It’s now down the soft provider.</p>
<p>everyday I’m requesting answer about what’s going on.</p>
<p>and they pretended it will be resolved.</p>
<p>Now they locked me from the chat without explanation</p>
