    <h1>Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa Royalton Punta Cana Resort And Casino Casino News Casino In Nashvill</h1>

<p>On 07.03.2023 I created an account on rocketplay.com without accepting any bonuses or Free Spins. I wanted to just play with my money only. So I deposited 20 EURO, played and won 600EUR. I requested the cashout on the same day (07.03.2023).</p>
<p>After 48 hours, my request was not processed by their "Financial department", although they specify a maximum processing time of 24 hours in their Terms &amp; Conditions. I tried to solve the issue by talking to them via live chat. The first time, they said that they have a 24-hour processing time and I should wait another 2 hours. I waited just to talk to another customer support agent to tell me that they have 72 hours of processing time. Back and forth in 2 days, I talked to 4 or 5 different agents, one of them saying that they can't process my request within my IBAN and I should redo the request with another eligible IBAN. But for that, they need to delete my payment method from their system. And that will take another 24 hours.</p>
<p>All good. I waited another 24 hours but I didn't receive any response from them. I contacted them again today and talked to another agent that said again that their processing time is 72 hours. I really think they are trying to fool me and waste my time so I will get tired of this back and forth and lose my fair-earned money.</p>
<p>They are not offering me any solutions at this moment. Please I need your help to cash out my funds, even if I need to change the IBAN or something else. I read their T&amp;C and they don't respect it.</p>
<p>I am attaching the scripts that I have, the emails received from them, and other proofs of my winnings. I specify that these funds were not wagered with any bonuses or FS. Only my deposited money.</p>
