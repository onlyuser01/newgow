    <h1>Tulsa Casino Hotels Silverton Casino Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Photos Casinos In M</h1>

<p>So i had signed up for this casino about 2 weeks ago and after i had signed up i needed help with making a deposit. On there website they say to contact them through there 24/7 live chat or email or phone number, I tried cntacting them live chat and it said there was no one able to assit like they were closed or whatever and they were out for over an hr, I tried calling the number online and the number didnt work i emailed them and got nothing back and when i was trying to figure out hto deposit since they werent answering i seen a bonus code and i thought it was a depositing bonus long story short i got stuck with a $100 free bonus when i didnt even want that i wanted to deposit more then that while playing this bonus i hit for $8,000 or a little over I checked to see if they wer online and they finally were so i reached out to them and told them ive been needing help for over an hr to deposit and now I hit for $8,000 and she had told me the max I can cash out was $100 which i called bs because i didnt even want that bonus that they werent open like they said they would be for over an hr to help me with my deposit so then she said she was going to give me this 100% no rule bonus to help me with my situation I repetedly asked her how much do I have to deposit to be able to pull all my money out because i was willing to deposit whatever i had to and the lady repeatedly told me only $50 dollars. I asked multiple times if I was going to be able to pull out all my money thats on my account and the lady told me repeatedly yes even before i made the deposit I asked one last time before doing it if thats all i needed to do was deposit $50 and ill be able to pull out all the money in my account and if she can explain to me what the bonus was she was adding to my account and what was supposed to happen was I get to pull out my money she said once i made the deposit reach back out to them and she closed the chat. After making the deposit I reached back out and told her I was done and if I can have help with withdrawing she then said I could only pull out $500 and I was confused because she just literally said less then 5 minutes before that i could pull out everything. Pretty much i feel like whoever I spoke to manipulated the situation knowing I didnt know what I was doing and Lied and I feel like they werent holding up what they said they were going to do and have 24/7 service and when i needed help I tried all forms of communication and each attempt was unsuccessful and then got stuck with a bonus i didnt even want or need and then whoever wants to manipulate and lie an when i asked where and who can i make a formal complaint to now i wont get response. So I feel like I should be able to withdraw all the money i rightfully earned and won and then we can cut ties because i dont want to be involved with a company that acts shady like them. I sent as many attachments of part of mines and there customer service and I have more but it wont let me upload them</p>
