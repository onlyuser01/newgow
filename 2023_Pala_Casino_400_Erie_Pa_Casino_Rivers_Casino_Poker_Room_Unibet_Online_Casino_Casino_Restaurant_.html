<p>The Myth review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Myth slot is themed around medieval fantasy.</p>
<p>Players will wander a chilly mountainside looking for dragons, precious stones, and magical wolves. The mythical world may bring to mind Game of Thrones and similar fantasy narratives.</p>
<p>The characters and setting have a familiar vibe that lovers of Celtic or Nordic lore may especially enjoy.</p>
<p>Win in The Myth slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of The Myth slot, is a calm instrumental tune that will bring to mind the traditional music of medieval times. This helps establish acinematic mood but doesn’t create much tension for gameplay.</p>
<p>The backdrop is a picturesque landscape with snowy mountains and a crystal lake. This adds to the sweeping sense of adventure in this game.</p>
<p>The Myth slot’s characters include symbols of a fierce Dragon, Skadi (a supernatural woman with icy eyes), and a plethora of ancient-looking stones. A bearded Viking adorned with blue warpaint seems to be the one most on the player's side. His expression is encouraging, as if he is about to follow us into battle along with the Wolf.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music of this game feel consistent with the theme and create a solid sense of place.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Myth slot is a five-reel, three-row game with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>After each spin, the player is offered the Risk’n’Buy feature. Players have the option to either continue playing or opt to move directly into one of the four random Bonus features (details below). If a player has won enough, they can risk their winnings in the bonus feature. If their winnings from the spin is not high enough they can buy into the feature using their account balance.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 94.8%, well below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Paytable for the high paying symbols</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend The Myth slot due to its low RTP and medium volatility.</p>
<p>With its devastatingly low RTP, this game is simply not redeemable despite its well-executed theme. It is unfortunately quite clear why this game is not more popular.</p>
<p>Even the most enthusiastic fantasy fans would do well to skip this one entirely and take their cash where it can pay off better.</p>
