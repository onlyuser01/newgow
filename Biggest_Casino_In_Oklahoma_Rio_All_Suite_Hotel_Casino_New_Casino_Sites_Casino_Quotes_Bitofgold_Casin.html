<p>Fulham FC and Fitzdares have teamed up and formed a new partnership that will see the sports betting brand and soccer club work on a number of joint marketing initiatives. The two organizations will work together to establish activations that will bring players “shared moments, history, and humor.”</p>
<p>Two Organizations Seeped in History Team Up</p>
<p>The partnership goes all the way back to the 19th century, argues Fitzdares CEO William Woodhams, who was thrilled to be teaming up with the soccer club, and he didn’t miss a chance to praise both organizations:</p>
<p>Dare I say, the only place better to watch football than The Fitzdares Club is at the Cottage. Fitzdares CEO William Woodhams</p>
<p>Fitzdares will do even more to ensure that fans are treated as they should be through a new dedicated menu available at the members-only club in Mayfair. The menu will be based on Fulham’s Craven Cottage home ground, the press release explained. Woodhams continued:</p>
<p>We will be adding a Craven Cottage Pie to our menu immediately to bring a taste of West London royalty to Mayfair. Fitzdares CEO William Woodhams</p>
<p>Understandably, there was a lot of excitement in Fulham’s corner, with the club’s sales director, Jon Don-Carolis, similarly pleased with the opportunity and welcomed Fitzdares as the club’s official UK betting partner. Don Carolis added:</p>
<p>Our organizations are proud of our heritage and embrace innovation whilst providing a closer and more personal experience for our fans and audiences. Fulham’s corner, with the club’s sales director, Jon Don-Carolis</p>
<p>He added that the two organizations were well aligned with each other, and they were two great organizations seeped in sports history that are coming together to create excellent opportunities for sports fans to feel closer to the action throughout the season.</p>
<p>Fulham’s Sports Betting Partnerships Continue</p>
<p>This comes against a backdrop of growing pressure on sports teams to sever ties with gambling sponsors and stop signing such partnerships in the first place. Fulham is presently also teamed up with W88, another sports betting firm, which is also the front-shirt sponsor for the club.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Fulham has weighed its decision against the current situation which is likely to see the Premier League feature sports betting companies as sponsors for the foreseeable future. Still, many Premier League clubs have come under fire from fans who have urged clubs to drop gambling partnerships.</p>
