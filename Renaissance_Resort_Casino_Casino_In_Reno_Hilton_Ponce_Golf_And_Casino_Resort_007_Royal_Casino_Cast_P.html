<p>NorthStar Gaming, a Canadian sports betting and online gaming brand has appointed Jennifer Barber as the company’s new chief financial officer. Barber has an extensive financial background and experience which will help NorthStar and its brands to establish themselves in key markets and continue to pursue growth and strategic objectives.</p>
<p>Introducing a Well-Seasoned Veteran on the Job</p>
<p>NorthStar founding partner and CEO Michael Moskowitz welcomed Barber’s addition to the team and praised her distinct qualities which will serve the company well. Commenting on her appointment, Moskowitz said:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to welcome Jennifer to NorthStar Gaming, she is a skilled financial leader who brings decades of financial management experience to our growing leadership team. NorthStar Gaming CEO Michael Moskowitz</p>
<p>He commended her experience in financial management and the fact that she is a seasoned executive who has worked in other executive positions that involved managing finances. This would bring immense value to NorthGaming’s own offer.</p>
<p>Barber brings much-needed experience to the team and she has previously worked in similar positions at Torstar Corporation. She was in charge of the financial reporting and management at the company, along with the information technology team. Her skills were further honed as part of the Torstar executive team where she was working actively to strengthen the corporate agenda and add value to the projects worked on.</p>
<p>She further improved her understanding of Torstar by serving in various positions over the years, which gave her a hands-on understanding of how the company worked. Torstar was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange before it was bought out by a private company. Barber also served as part of the Hydrogenics Corporation, another NASDAQ and TSX-listed company, earlier in her career when she worked as CFO &amp; corporate secretary.</p>
<p>NorthStar Gaming Launches Betting and Gaming Brand</p>
<p>NorthStar Gaming welcomes the new addition of Barber at a time when the company is looking to capitalize on its expertise in the gambling sector. The company launched the NorthStar Bets online casino and sportsbook in Ontario last week made possible by Ontario’s decision to legalize its private gambling industry. NorthStar prides itself on a tailored gambling offer that focuses on local expectations and needs from the segment and delivers on those.</p>
