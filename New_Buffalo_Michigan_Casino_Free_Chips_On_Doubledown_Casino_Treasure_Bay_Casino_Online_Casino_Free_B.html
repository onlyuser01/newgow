<p>Hunter Biden apparently photographed himself driving 172 mph to Las Vegas, according to newly released photos purported to be from his infamous abandoned laptop. According to a photo taken of the dashboard of his silver Porsche on Aug. 1, 2018, Hunter was traveling over twice the legal speed limit of Interstate 15.</p>

<p>The photos were published on Sunday, July 2, 2023 by the Daily Mail, along with threads appeaing to show Hunter texting multiple women awaiting his arrival in Sin City for a hot tub party. According to the British tabloid, the women were prostitutes.</p>

<p>“I don’t have a bathing suit and I really really wanted to wear a cute bathing suit,” wrote one of the women, saved in Hunter’s contacts as Cheryl. “But I don’t have any money to buy one so then I’m just going to have to be naked right?”</p>
<p>The future first son’s party didn’t receive rave reviews, however — at least according to one attendee, whom the Daily Mail quotes as writing: “Honestly babe the problem is you have too many girls there.”</p>
<p>The Vegas trip appears to have been part of a bender Hunter admitted to partaking in during a January 2019 conversation with a prostitute. That conversation — first reported by the Daily Mail in August 2021 — occurred after he filmed them having sex and forgot to turn off his laptop camera. During the conversation, Hunter reportedly recounted to his guest the Vegas trip five months earlier, saying that he spent “18 days going round from penthouse suite to penthouse suite,” sometimes at the cost of $10K a night.</p>
<p>No Las Vegas resort was named by the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>First Crack</p>
<p>But the bevvy of incriminating new laptop photos doesn’t stop there. One also appears to show Hunter Biden smoking crack while driving through a residential neighborhood in Arlington, Va. on June 12, 2018.</p>
<p>In Hunter’s 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things,” Hunter admitted to crashing a Buick Verano while speeding through Palm Springs, Calif. during another drug bender in October 2016. In the book, Hunter wrote that he was high for 12 consecutive days before entering an Arizona rehab.</p>
<p>Are the Photos Legit?</p>
<p>Though the Daily Mail didn’t say where it obtained the photos, most appear to have come from a right-wing website run by Marco Polo, a nonprofit firm headed by former Donald Trump aide Garrett Ziegler. The website, BidenLaptopMedia.com, is a collection of 10,000 newly uploaded Hunter files spanning 2008 to 2019.</p>
<p>The photos reportedly come from a laptop left in a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. That shop’s owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, said the laptop was left by a man identifying himself as Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>Isaac filed a defamation suit against Hunter Biden last year, alleging that he falsely insisted that the laptop was not his, but that it had been stolen or hacked instead. Hunter’s attorneys have since countersued for “the unauthorized accessing and dissemination” of “sensitive, private material.”</p>
<p>Material from the laptop first became public in October 2020, when the New York Post published emails that it claimed were stored there.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden has never publicly claimed ownership of the laptop. In a 2021 interview, he said it could be his, or it could have been hacked, or possibly be a Russian fabrication.</p>
