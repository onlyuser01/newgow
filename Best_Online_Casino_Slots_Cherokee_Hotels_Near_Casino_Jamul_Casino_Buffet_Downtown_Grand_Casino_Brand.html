<p>Postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2019-20 Premier League season will end on July 26. The new Premier League season 2020-21 is set to start on September 12 along with the English Football League (EFL).</p>
<p>September 12 Marks the Start of the UK Premier League</p>
<p>The new 2020-21 Premier League season in the UK starts on September 12. This was announced by the League yesterday. The Premier League 2019-20 season was planned to end back in May. However, with the growing spread of the respiratory disease COVID-19, the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season were pushed back. In fact, all major sports events around the globe were temporarily suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Sports in the UK were also suspended. Back on June 17, the UK officials gave the green light for professional sports to return. Although the cycle of the Premier League was changed, the new 2020-21 season will kick off on September 12 and will run through May 23, 2021. Keeping in mind the start of the new Premier League season 2020-21, the current season’s last game will be played tomorrow, July 26. On the other hand, the FA cup final game between Arsenal and Chelsea is set for next Saturday, August 1.</p>

<p>September 12 will also mark the start of the season of the English Football League (EFL). The schedule of the FA cup was delayed as well due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. But similar to the Premier League, the FA cup was allowed to resume play on June 17.</p>
<p>Turning our eyes to the Premier League once again, usually the players would have a break of three months between the competitive games. However, this year, such a break won’t be possible. Instead the teams will have little time to rest before the start of the new Premier League 2020-21 season. What is known so far is that there will be 20 clubs competing in the new season with the full list expected to be confirmed soon.</p>
