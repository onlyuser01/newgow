<p>Sports betting exchange Exbet has signed a new partnership agreement with OddsCraft ahead of its official launch. Having recently trialed Exbet beta, the former company is excited to capitalize on its innovative format once it launches.</p>
<p>OddsCraft is a renowned supplier of sportsbook technology that will provide Exbet with bespoke pricing for the exchange’s unique scalar markets. Like other exchanges, Exbet would allow customers to trade sports in the same way finance enthusiasts trade crypto.</p>
<p>The Exbet open beta welcomed thousands of consumers who staked millions of dollars on the platform, attesting to the potential of the platform. All existing bets were honored prior to the exchange’s temporary closure.</p>
<p>Set to include more markets than during its beta stage, Exbet originally planned to have its official launch in 2023. However, this approximate period was eventually pushed back to early 2024, when the platform plans to finally hit the market.</p>
<p>In any case, the leadership remains excited about the eventual launch and sharing a next-gen sports betting exchange with the world.</p>
<p>OddsCraft Will Fuel Exbet’s Unique Product with Reliable Pricing</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the new partnership, sharing their excitement to work together. OddsCraft’s co-founder, Robin Jakobsson, said that his team is “thrilled to partner up” with Exbet, which he lauded as an innovative idea.</p>
<p>Jakobsson explained that the platform Exbet is working on is an unprecedented product that “doesn’t exist elsewhere.” Because of that, OddsCraft’s team is excited to leverage its tech expertise to “deliver pricing that will facilitate what’s going to be a game-changing new sports betting product.”</p>
<p>David Evans, an Exbet representative, also commented on the matter. He noted that the crypto sector currently offers a wealth of trading products. However, there is currently no sports betting product that “speaks the language” of people who enjoy trading as a form of entertainment.</p>
<p>The representative said that trading enthusiasts are usually intelligent individuals who know “how to read charts, have a high appetite for risk and want to trade sports like they trade crypto.”</p>
<p>According to Evans, the partnership with OddsCraft will provide his team with the ability to reasonably price its products and offer a “completely unique” category of markets that no one else offers. This will allow Exbet to appeal to the millions of people who crypto enjoy trading and sports.</p>
<p>Fans should stay tuned for more news about Exbet’s official launch.</p>
