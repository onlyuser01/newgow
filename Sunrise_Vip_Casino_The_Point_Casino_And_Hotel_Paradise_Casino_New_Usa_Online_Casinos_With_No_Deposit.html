<p>UK-based social gaming and sports betting operator BetBull teamed up beBettor to utilize its responsible gaming data offering with regards to affordability checks.</p>
<p>Affordability Checks – beBettor’s Flagship Product</p>
<p>The partnership between BetBull and the independent technology and data science company beBettor will provide the gaming operator with instant geo-affordability checks for its UK customers via beBettor’s API services.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be working with beBettor on affordability.” Ian Tannok, Head of Safer Gambling, BetBull</p>
<p>Specialized in providing responsible gaming data and tools for the betting and gaming industry in their attempts to combat problem gambling and comply with constantly evolving regulatory standards, beBettor’s affordability checks represent the flagship product of the technology company.</p>
<p>“We’ve been really impressed with the beBettor team and their friendly support and approach has been first class. It was a major factor in our decision to proceed with integrating beBettor’s affordability solution.” Ian Tannok, Head of Safer Gambling, BetBull</p>
<p>BetBull’s Proactive Approach</p>
<p>The partnership signals a proactive approach from BetBull to better understand its customers and ensure a higher level of protection with regards to possible regulatory or legislative changes in the UK, while other stakeholders in the gaming, horseracing, and sports betting industries elect to oppose the proposed measure, warning of millions of losses if the measure is to be implemented.</p>
<p>The issue of affordability checks is a hot topic in the country recently, especially with the continuing consultation period initiated last year by the Gambling Commission and the government’s upcoming review of the Gambling Act 2005.</p>
<p>“It is great for us to announce our new partnership with BetBull who are at the cutting edge of the industry today. We have really enjoyed working with the BetBull team who are integrating the new affordability data we provide into their next-generation safer gambling frameworks.” Scott McGregor, COO, beBettor</p>
<p>Automated affordability checks provided by beBettor improve the rate of early identification for those at risk of excessive gambling, including people on the bankruptcy and insolvency registers, thereby providing an extra layer of protection for customers from developing gambling-related harms by spending beyond their means.</p>
<p>The social gaming operator BetBull is in the process of being absorbed in the $80 million joint venture it set with Nevada-based casino and hospitality operator Wynn Resorts, Wynn Interactive, as part of the land-based gaming company’s efforts to diversify its portfolio with the addition of online gambling verticals.</p>
