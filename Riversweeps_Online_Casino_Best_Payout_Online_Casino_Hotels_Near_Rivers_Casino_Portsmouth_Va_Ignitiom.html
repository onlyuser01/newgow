<p>The grand prize from the popular game is expected to hit $295 million for the next drawing scheduled for Monday, November 20, 2023</p>
<p>Early in October, one lucky player from California hit the Powerball jackpot, taking home some $1.76 billion. Since then, the grand prize of America’s favorite lottery has been gradually growing, starting from $20 million. Surviving the draws so far, the jackpot is getting closer to $300 million for its drawing scheduled for Monday, November 20, 2023.</p>
<p>With hours left to go, the grand prize from Powerball is estimated to hit $295 million. This is the sum if the winner of the jackpot selects monthly installment payments. In case the future winner picks a lump cash sum, they can take home some $135.8 million.</p>
<p>But first, to win the grand prize, a player needs to guess correctly all five white balls, along with the red Powerball from the upcoming drawing. Changes of that happening are slim or 1 in 292.2 million. Still, the overall odds of winning a prize from Powerball are 1 in 24.9.</p>
<p>Recently, a man from Albuquerque purchased tickets for Powerball, Mega Millions and Lotto America. Using the numbers he picked himself, the lucky man was able to hit Lotto America’s jackpot, taking home some $3.52 million.</p>
<p>One Lucky Lottery Player Takes Home $1M from the Drawing on Saturday</p>
<p>The latest Powerball drawing on Saturday saw no one guess correctly all white balls, 34, 50, 51, 61, 67 and the red Powerball, 20. Still, one lucky player guessed correctly all white balls, taking home a second-tier prize of $1 million.</p>
<p>Moreover, 11 players collected a $50,000 prize each for guessing correctly four white balls and the red Powerball from the drawing on Saturday. Some three lucky winners took home a Power Play Prize of $100,000 each as well.</p>
<p>More than 440,000 lucky players secured the lowest tier prize of $4 each, while nearly 140,000 took home an $8 Power Play prize each for guessing correctly only the red Powerball or one white ball along with the red Powerball from the past drawing.</p>
<p>So far, four out of Powerball’s five biggest jackpots have been won in California. The biggest-ever jackpot from the lottery game was hit back in November last year, a staggering $2.04 billion. The grand prize that dropped last month, again in California, was the second-biggest jackpot.</p>
