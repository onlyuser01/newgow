<p>Gaming and sports betting leader BetMGM has continued to drive differentiation and innovation to its brand through signing prominent Hollywood stars for its spots, and now – through the introduction of NHL Gold Blitz, an NHL-endorsed online slot that is now available to players in the Garden State. The game will soon be available in other jurisdictions where BetMGM operates, targeting the United States specifically.</p>
<p>NHL Gold Blitz has been developed by Digital Gaming Corporation, which specializes in creating tailored and player-focused games for the market in the United States and has been working hard through its B2B iGaming division to bring memorable experiences to casino players.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, DGC B2B iGaming Division CCO, Neill Whyte, welcomed the chance to work with BetMGM, a company that understands the importance of bringing "unique and diverse" content to players, and continue to stock its library with titles that lead to high engagement and entertainment.</p>
<p>"Our collaboration on NHL Gold Blitz does just that. A great game, a great brand and a great team," the executive explained confidently. BetMGM welcomed the news in kind, with VP of Gaming Product &amp; Content at BetMGM, Oliver Bartlett, arguing that the opportunity to work with both DGC and NHL has been an excellent chance for the company to create a first-of-its-kind slot for players.</p>
<p>"We are proud to offer this and many more unique games exclusively at BetMGM," Bartlett added. This is hardly the first time BetMGM has worked on building and launching NHL-themed games, with the company introducing various table games, such as baccarat, blackjack, and roulette that bore the signage of the NHL, and also releasing a themed live show, Dream Catcher to strengthen its offer.</p>
<p>BetMGM is an official betting partner for the NHL, which has prompted the two organizations to seek closer collaborations. In the meantime, NHL Gold Blitz should also be coming to more states before long, including in Michigan and Pennsylvania, but also Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>As to the game itself, it’s a 6x4 video slot which offers more than 4,096 ways to win and comes with an Instant Cash Collection, Wild Multiplier Free Spins, and jackpots to enjoy. BetMGM has been actively seeking to strengthen the experience players can enjoy in its casino in New Jersey, including through the most recent addition of Borgata Arcade to the Garden State and the available online casino platform there.</p>
