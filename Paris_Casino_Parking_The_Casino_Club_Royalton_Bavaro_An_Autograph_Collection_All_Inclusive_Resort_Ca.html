<p>The new commercial will also feature two of the company’s most prominent brand ambassadors</p>
<p>DraftKings has unveiled a brand new commercial featuring two of its brand ambassadors. The new commercial will also feature the American operator’s brand-new tagline, “The crown is yours.”</p>
<p>Preceding the new National Football League season by a few weeks, the new commercial will feature the retired NFL quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, as well as the comedian Kevin Hart. The celebrities will leverage their ambassadorial roles to promote DraftKings’ brand ahead of the NFL action.</p>
<p>The upcoming commercial is set to launch on Monday, August 21. It will promote one of the operator’s tempting promotional deals and welcome offers that provide players with hundreds of dollars in free bets.</p>
<p>The new tagline, meanwhile, is meant to highlight DraftKings’ titular royal theme while promoting the company as an operator willing to elevate its players. The tagline will be deployed across DraftKings’ channels and social media accounts.</p>
<p>Like Fitz-Magic</p>
<p>The new commercial will feature the two ambassadors benefiting from a DraftKings offer that provides players with $200 in free bets after placing a $5 bet. In the commercial, Hart says that the operator is spoiling him while Fitzpatrick would call the promotional deal “Fitz-magic.”</p>
<p>DraftKings’ chief marketing officer, Stephanie Sherman, addressed the launch of the new commercial and her company’s vision. She said that the DraftKings team really resonated with Hart’s lighthearted and witty humor. Because of his qualities as a comedian, Hart was the perfect person to bring DraftKings’ exciting promotions to life.</p>
<p>Sherman added that the new commercial reflects the company’s desire to innovate while continuing to engage fans. This is further reflected in DraftKings’ customer-centric approach and new tagline that suggests the operators’ players are the true kings.</p>
<p>DraftKings Continues to Defy Expectations</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the American operator published its Q2 2023 results. This was notably the company’s first profitable quarter since its listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange.</p>
<p>In addition, DraftKings’ favorable performance helped it defy the skeptics who believed the company’s performance would continue to decline.</p>
<p>While the company’s resilience will continue to be tested in the third and fourth quarters of the year, DraftKings remains fairly optimistic about its business. The operator is certain that its operations in Kentucky and Puerto Rico will be major contributors to its business that will help it excel in Q4.</p>
