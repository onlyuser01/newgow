<p>Australian clubs Sydney Swans and Macarthur FC have joined the Reclaim the Game initiative to ban betting ads and protect fans from gambling risks.</p>
<p>Reclaim the Game Awareness Campaign</p>
<p>New South Wales sports fans will soon be able to watch games without seeing betting ads. The state’s Office of Responsible Gambling has teamed up with two local sports clubs on a new project that will enable viewers in the Australian state to enjoy wagerings ads-free broadcasts.</p>
<p>Rules football club Sydney Swans and A-League soccer team Macarthur FC have signed up to the Reclaim the Game initiative and agreed not to consider any betting-related sponsorships.</p>
<p>Both teams also announced they are committed to fighting problem-gambling by educating their players, staff, and supporters on the dangers of gambling.</p>
<p>The Office of Responsible Gambling and Cricket NSW signed a similar agreement in October last year. The authority is currently in discussions with other sporting codes and clubs in order to announce further sign-ups later this year.</p>
<p>“Sport is a big part of our Australian culture, and it should be enjoyed without having to experience gambling advertising as part of a match.”</p>
<p>Natalie Wright, Director of the New South Wales Office of Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>Australian Sports Clubs Committed to Supporting Fans</p>
<p>Director Natalie Wright declared that the organization now has four major deals spanning three of the most popular sporting codes after beginning the initiative with cricket. “That really speaks to clubs recognizing their role in looking after their fans and their communities,” Wright said.</p>
<p>Sydney Swans chief executive officer Tom Harley stated that the partnership’s main goal is to acknowledge and offset the “normalization” of sports wagering. Therefore, no gambling advertisement or sponsorship will be allowed at Swans games at the Sydney Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>Harley noted that the club is extremely pleased to join the NSW Government’s Reclaim the Game awareness campaign to educate about the potential risks of gambling.</p>
<p>“As a club, we want to ensure we are looking after the wellbeing of our members, fans, and the wider community. This partnership does just that,” said Gino Marra, chairman of Macarthur FC. Marra stressed that the club is thrilled to support Macarthur fans and commended the collaboration.</p>
