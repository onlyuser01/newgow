<p>Future Anthem has secured a new milestone with the company, focused on leveraging AI and data science to garner real-time insights into consumer behavior and onboard consumers responsibly, analyzing one billion game sessions or some 100m hours of gameplay.</p>
<p>This is a seminal achievement for Future Anthem which was launched in 2019 and is for all intents and purposes, a pioneer in its respective field. The company leverages both machine learning and AI to ensure that it better understands how consumers interact with online gambling products.</p>
<p>The data that was analyzed by Future Anthem includes 89bn real-money spins, the specialist said in a press release. The company helps with both addressing problem gambling but also ensures that it leverages real-time personalization across a player’s journey to drive robust business performance.</p>
<p>Future Anthem’s unique industry nous and real-time personalization product is focusing on using data to improve acquisition, retention, and player sustainability in the long term. Future Anthem is powered by Microsoft Azure and it’s de facto the first data science platform that operates in the gambling industry. It’s an example of how such solutions can be used to drive significant business results and strengthen a company’s standing in gambling.</p>
<p>Future Anthem has processed metadata for 20,000 casino games, along with 200bn player transactions – a staggering number that Future Anthem has been able to then analyze with the help of its powerful data-driven solutions.</p>
<p>Commenting on the present success and its implications for the company’s future, Chris Conroy, Chief Data Officer, said that the company is continuing to grow and develop, leveraging AI to reach new heights.</p>
<p>Technology alone, though, is not enough to make this happen, as Future Anthem also depends on its in-house team of specialists such as data scientists, developers, product managers, and engineers.</p>
<p>"Operators and suppliers are keenly aware of the importance of integrating the latest technologies into their product offering, and real-time personalization is at the forefront of these advancements," argues Conroy. The new milestone outlined by the company is proof that Future Anthem is headed in the right direction, helping partner operators achieve the best possible results.</p>
<p>Future Anthem has recently appointed ex-IG executive Ann-Kathrin Baumgardt as its new VP of Sales and Customer Development for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, as the company continues to strengthen its presence in these geographies and has been facing higher demand for its products.</p>
