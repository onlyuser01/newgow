<p>The suspect, Domach Khai, 31, of Sioux Falls, was charged with first-degree robbery, aggravated assault, and other counts, Dakota News Now, a regional news site, reported.</p>
<p>He was charged with the following incidents:</p>
<p>January 20 robbery at Get-N-Go.</p>
<p>A second January 20 robbery at Paradise Casino.</p>
<p>January 22 robbery at Neon Casino.</p>

<p>Khai allegedly showed a knife during one of the January 20 robberies and during the January 25 heist. He reportedly left with cash in all four instances.</p>
<p>Kahi was apprehended by the Sioux Falls Area Joint Fugitive Task Force in front of a local apartment building. The South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation assisted in the arrest. Police were able to find Khai thanks to video footage from the crime scenes.</p>
<p>Bond was set at $100K, Clemens said. Khai was sentenced on three counts of first-degree robbery in 2015, the report added.</p>
<p>Oklahoma Casino Shooting</p>
<p>A Wyandotte Nation Tribal Police officer shot an unidentified man during a Thursday morning confrontation outside of Oklahoma’s River Bend Casino and Hotel.</p>
<p>The wounded man was rushed to a hospital in Missouri. He underwent emergency surgery and was listed in critical condition late on Thursday, an FBI spokesperson told Casino.org. He is expected to survive, the FBI added.</p>
<p>The suspect had been brandishing a weapon while in the Wyandotte, Okla. casino’s parking lot in the 9 a.m. incident.</p>
<p>The FBI and Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation took over the case because the incident occurred on Indian Trust land, according to the FBI.</p>
<p>Washington State Money Laundering</p>
<p>This week in Washington State, the ringleader of a drug trafficking operation was sentenced to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>The defendant, Cesar Valdez-Sanudo, 36, schemed to launder more than $1 million through casino gambling, according to Washington State Western District US Attorney Nick Brown.</p>
<p>When he was arrested at the Snoqualmie Casino, Valdez-Sanudo had three firearms in a vehicle, one with a homemade silencer. He pleaded guilty in June 2022 to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and carrying a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking crime.</p>
<p>Law enforcement seized approximately 143 pounds of methamphetamine (meth), 15 pounds of heroin, 35,000 suspected fentanyl pills, 24 firearms, and approximately $778,000 during their search of his Arlington, Wash. property.</p>
<p>Four Face Judge for Illegal Gambling</p>
<p>In Michigan, one of four people accused of illegal gambling at the Ludington Eagles Club pleaded guilty to a gambling charge this week at 79th District Court.</p>
<p>Gary Lee Mallion, 72, was ordered to pay $390 in fines. He was placed on six months’ probation.</p>
<p>Under the plea, three felonies were dismissed. The charges were conspiracy gambling, gambling house permitting for gain, and maintaining a gambling house for gain. Police alleged that pull tabs, punch boards, and games of dice were used to gamble at the Eagles club.</p>
<p>Three other defendants, Suann Marie Mortensen, 52, George Alan Karl, 65, and Thomas Lee Johnson, 62, are scheduled to appear in court next Wednesday.</p>
