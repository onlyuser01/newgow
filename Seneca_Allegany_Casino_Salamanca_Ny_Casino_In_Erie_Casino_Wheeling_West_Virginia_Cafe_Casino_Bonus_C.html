    <h1>Seneca Allegany Casino Salamanca Ny Casino In Erie Casino Wheeling West Virginia Cafe Casino Bonus C</h1>

<p>Dear Tomas and restohotel68,</p>
<p>We are glad to provide an update and explanation regarding the recent issues with the withdrawal process. All updates and explanations were provided to our User by email, we have nothing to hide, we are here to share details with Casino Guru Team.</p>
<p>The user initially requested a withdrawal to a Lithuanian IBAN. However, our payment provider does not process payments to this region, leading to the rejection of the withdrawal request. The user was promptly advised to choose an alternative bank and make a new withdrawal request.</p>
<p>Following this, the user's account and first withdrawal request were fully verified within a few hours, and the payment was executed accordingly to the new bank account provided. Unfortunately, due to holiday delays, our payment provider experienced an extended processing time for the transaction.</p>
<p>As of today, we have been informed by our payment provider that the timeline for the payment's return depends on the type of transfer involved. Although the user has provided documentation showing that their bank processed the payment on November 9th, our payment provider has not yet received it. It's important to note that neither Blazzio Casino nor our payment partner can influence the time it takes for the payment to arrive. The type of transfer chosen by User's bank takes more time, unfortunately.</p>
<p>This is the first instance we have encountered such a situation, and we deeply regret any inconvenience this has caused to the user. We completely understand the frustration and concern this delay may have caused.</p>
<p>We wish to assure all concerned parties that the funds will be paid to the user, and a withdrawal to a newly verified method will be arranged as soon as our payment provider receives this payment. We are actively monitoring the situation and will provide updates as soon as more information becomes available.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter. We are committed to resolving this issue as swiftly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Blazzio Casino Manager</p>
