    <h1>Dania Beach Casino Casino Games Free Play Casino In Myrtle Beach Lake Tahoe Casino Hotels Boonville</h1>

<p>Dear Kristina,</p>
<p>Yes it is correct, I still haven't receive my winnings yet since I won that money last December 5,2020.</p>
<p>What happened here was that I requested for a cash out through my Visa Card/Debit Card not a Credit Card. They said that they already processed it and it is already in my Bank Account but it did not went through. I sent them my Bank Statements from December 5 to January 14,2021 that shows nothing was being transferred from them. But they keep on insisting to ask my bank to locate the ARN number that they gave me. Which my bank officer said that they can not locate a ARN number it must be the Remitter to do a Destination Tracing to find out where the money went. But they keep on insisting to ask my bank for a statement that they have not receive the money. On my bank statements that I submit to them there was a note on it from my bank officer stamped and signed that the Remitter is the one should locate the ARN number by doing a Destination Tracing and my bank is only a receiver. There was no money in my bank statements that coming from them and that meant that the bank did not receive it.</p>
<p>You see my Visa Card is a Debit Card not a Credit Card so from International Transactions they need a SWIFT CODE BSB A/C. That's why the money did not get through my Bank Account. I point this out to them but they are not listening and keep on insisting that I should ask my bank for a statement that they can not find the ARN number on their banking system. I don't know why they can not locate it themselves through a Destination Tracing where the money went. If the ARN number is really true then there is no reason not to track it since they would have a paper trail for it. They would have a documents of the said transaction. I asked them if they can send me a copy of the transaction of the transfer of the ARN number to prove that it occur. I will show it to my bank if there is anything they can do about it. But they never send my a proof of the transaction. How would I know that they only making this ARN number up? It is easy for them to say ARN number but how true is it since there nothing that shows in my bank statement of any amount of money coming from them. As what my bank officer said, it is not possible for them to locate a ARN number. It should be the Remitter who do it by doing a Destination Tracing.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me with this Kristina. It is not fair what they are doing to me. They make me going back and forth to my bank and to them. It is so frustrating and depressing.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Maria Bella D***</p>
