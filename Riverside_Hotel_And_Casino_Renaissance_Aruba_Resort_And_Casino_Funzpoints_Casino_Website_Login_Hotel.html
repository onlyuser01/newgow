Real Madrid welcome their intercity rivals Atletico Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu, the venue where Los Blancos are undefeated since March 2022.

<p>Confidence is High at Santiago Bernabeu</p>
<p>Real Madrid are coming into the Madrid Derby after a brilliant performance in the Champions League. On Tuesday, Los Blancos defeated Liverpool 5-2 at Anfield, even though they were 2-0 down after 14 minutes.</p>
<p>Vinicius Junior was their hero that day, scoring two goals and recording one assist. Karim Benzema scored two as well, while Eder Militao put away one.</p>
<p>The win over Liverpool was their fifth straight victory in all competitions. They’re now one step away from moving to the next stage of the Champions League, while they’re also still in the competition for Copa Del Rey and even La Liga.</p>
<p>Carlo Ancelotti’s boys are second in the Spanish top flight, with eight points fewer than Barcelona. Nevertheless, the season is long, meaning that they still have a decent chance to challenge for the title. For that, however, they need to keep winning.</p>
<p>Atletico Madrid are Great at the Back (As Always)</p>
<p>Diego Simeone’s team is sitting in the No. 4 position in La Liga. They’re 18 points behind the table leaders, meaning that they probably won’t win the title. Still, they do have the motivation to keep fighting. Finishing in top 4 is their goal for the season, as it would take them to the Champions League.</p>
<p>To achieve that, they just need to keep on doing what they’ve been doing so far. And that means that they need to keep on playing great at the back. Atleti have conceded only 17 goals (same as Real Madrid), with no more than two goals conceded per game in their last 10 La Liga matches.</p>
<p>Real Madrid vs Atletico Madrid Prediction</p>
<p>Real Madrid have been great in the offense lately; Atletico Madrid have been fantastic at the back. We think both will continue playing well – Real Madrid will score, but probably not too many times. In fact, we think that the most likely outcome of Saturday’s Madrid Derby is a 1-0 win for the home team.</p>
<p>Picks: Real Madrid to win and under 2.5 goals</p>
