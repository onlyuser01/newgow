<p>The Tropicana is among the latest Las Vegas Strip properties to announce a reopening date following months of shuttering. Unfortunately, patrons will have to wait until the fall to gamble.</p>

<p>The Penn National Gaming casino is planning to resume limited operations at 10 am on Sept. 1. Concern over the spread of coronavirus shut the venue in mid-March.</p>
<p>Penn National’s other casino in southern Nevada, M Resort, resumed limited operations on June 4. Many Las Vegas gaming properties reopened in June.</p>
<p>What to Expect</p>
<p>Like with other Nevada casinos, the crowd on the gaming floor will be restricted to 50 percent of the capacity, as determined by building and fire officials. Visitors will see other health and safety precautions in place, too. Among these are the required wearing of face masks, except when eating meals or consuming beverages. Social distancing will be in effect.</p>
<p>Guests can select from several reopened restaurants in September, such as Bacio, Oakville, Red Lotus, Robert Irvine’s Public House, and Starbucks. The property’s food court will also resume operations then.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Sun reported that a Tropicana hotel room for two adults on Sept. 5 will cost $139, without fees and taxes, based on online information. But guests in September will not see live entertainment, nor will there be conventions or tournaments, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Previously this summer, an unspecified number of employees at the Tropicana who had been furloughed were notified permanent layoffs are possible sometime later this year, the Review-Journal said.</p>
<p>Now Under New Owners</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Penn National announced the sale of the real estate of the Tropicana to Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. It is a real estate investment trust. The transaction was for $307.5 million in rent credits.</p>
<p>GLPI was spun off from Penn National. The REIT owns the property assets of 44 casinos and related establishments and counts the Penn as its largest tenant.</p>
