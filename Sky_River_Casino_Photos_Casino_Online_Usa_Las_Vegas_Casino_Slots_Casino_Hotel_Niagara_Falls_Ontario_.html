<p>Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. (GLPI) has reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2022. The report states that the company’s total revenue for Q2 was $326.5 million, which is an increase compared to Q1 of 2021 when the company’s revenue was $317.8 million.</p>
<p>GLPI Completed Several Acquisitions in Q2 of 2022</p>
<p>Peter Carlino, GLPI’s CEO, and chairman commented on the increase in revenue. He stated that the company’s growth includes the acquisitions of real estate assets of Bally’s Corporation for a price of $150 million. GLPI purchased 3 casinos in Bally’s Quad Cities Casino &amp; Hotel in Rock Island, IL, and Black Hawk, CO.</p>
<p>Carlino also added that GLPI expanded its relationship with Bally’s by acquiring 2 Rhode Island casinos at the end of June. Bally’s Tiverton Casino &amp; Hotel and Bally’s Twin River Lincoln Casino Resort were purchased for a price of $1 billion.</p>
<p>While sharing details on the Rhode Island casinos, Carlino noted that due to the fact that they are the only 2 gaming facilities in Rhode Island, they “generate excellent operating results.” More importantly, Carlino said that the transaction features a master lease structure and a conservative rent, which allows GLPI with an opportunity for long-term growth, while also having “material downside protection.”</p>
<p>According to the financial results, GLPI’s income from operations in Q2 of 2022 was $237.1 million, which is a massive increase compared to Q2 of 2021, when the revenue was $212.1 million. Net income was $155.8 million, which has also increased significantly from Q1 in 2021 ($138.1 million).</p>
<p>Funds from operations (FFO) revenue was $215.3 million, adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was $231.6 million and adjusted EBITDA was $307.6 million.</p>
<p>Carlino Shared Some Words on the Future of GLPI</p>
<p>While reflecting on the second quarter of 2022, Carlino also shared some information on the near future of GLPI.</p>
<p>He stated that if the approvals for the Bally’s Twin River Lincoln acquisition are “not received on a timely basis,” the company plans to buy Bally’s Tiverton Casino &amp; Hotel and Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Biloxi in Mississippi for a price of $635 million.</p>
<p>Carlino noted that GLPI is well-positioned to deliver fantastic results in the second half of 2022 because the company is looking to expand and further “diversify its portfolio.” In terms of the recent growth of the company, Carlino said that GLPI is happy with the success it had so far and that it intends to invest in both new and existing tenant relationships. These factors will drive long-term value for the company’s shareholders, Carlino concluded.</p>
<p>GLPI estimates that AFFO for the year ending on December 31, 2022, will be somewhere between $908 million and $920 million.</p>
