<p>Super Diamond Wild review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The goal of Super Diamond Wild seems to be simplicity. Three by three grid, classic symbols, with just a few basic tweaks.</p>
<p>This is all presented with a one-armed bandit style set of visuals with glass fronted reels and flashing lights.</p>
<p>Low tier symbol gives a huge win if combined with the top (x10) multiplier</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>It helps greatly that all this is given a real surface shine by excellent, hi-def artwork and animations that make for a good looking slot from iSoftBet.</p>
<p>The music is easily faded into the background and has a soothing style that goes well with the stripped down nature of the slot machine.</p>
<p>Win thanks to hitting of 2 Wild symbols</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The three by three grid has five win lines covering the five straight lines you can have of three symbols on a grid of that size.</p>
<p>There are a few small tweaks to spice up the play by play but these are small changes like respins and a multiplier wheel.</p>
<p>On the whole the gameplay for Super Diamond Wild is very basic. For some players, this will be a selling point, for others a source of abject boredom.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbols substitute for all other symbols.</p>
<p>If two of the reels land a matching stack (i.e. three of the same symbol on both) and there are no winning combinations, then the remaining reel respins once.</p>
<p>Hit full screen of the same symbols and you multiply your winnings in the Bonus Wheel round</p>
<p>Hitting top multiplier in the Bonus Wheel almost guarantees a huge win</p>
<p>If you manage to land nine identical symbols in one spin, filling all the reels, you will trigger a wheel of fortune style mini-game which will give you a randomised multiplier between x2 and x10 for your win.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.66%. This is a little disappointing as our yardstick return to player is 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum of $/£/€0.05 to a maximum bet per spin of $/£/€50.00.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium to high. Given the low RTP this is not high enough to attract us.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Super Diamond Wild</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Super Diamond Wild is a visually pleasing slot. Well designed both at the gameplay level and at the simple level of graphics.</p>
<p>However, a low RTP scuppers its chances of getting a recommendation from us. Particularly with its moderate levels of volatility.</p>
