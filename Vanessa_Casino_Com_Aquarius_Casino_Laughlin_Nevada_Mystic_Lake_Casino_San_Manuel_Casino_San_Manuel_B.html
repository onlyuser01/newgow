<p>Escape IT, an IT-themed escape room, has finally opened its doors in Las Vegas after being delayed last year.</p>
<p>New IT-themed Escape Room Spans Over More Than 30,000 Square Feet</p>
<p>Escape IT spans more than 30,000 square feet and is described as a revolutionary new take on traditional escape room experiences. Developed by Jason Eagon, the founder of Fright Dome and the Saw escape room, and Warner Bros, Escape IT is inspired by one of the most horrifying film franchises of all time, “IT”, which is based on Stephen King’s book of the same name.</p>
<p>Escape IT has two multi-room escape adventures that bring to life the movie’s most iconic locations, such as the infamous Neibolt House, the Losers’ Clubhouse, the Derry Canal Days Festival, and the sewers below Derry. The attraction features 20 interactive rooms with state-of-the-art special FX, lighting, animatronics, and live actors to create a fully immersive and terrifying experience.</p>
<p>The attraction aims to put guests’ skills and critical thinking to the test as they try to escape the clutches of Pennywise, the Dancing Clown. There’s no turning back once visitors enter the town of Derry to search for the lost children.</p>
<p>Escape IT Chapter One is now open, and IT Chapter Two is set to open later this year. The attraction also includes carnival-styled midway games and a full-scale IT-themed retail store with photo opportunities and exclusive custom merchandise.</p>
<p>Escape IT can be found at the intersection of Symphony Parkway and Martin Luther King Blvd. Admission to this thrilling experience starts at $54.99.</p>
<p>Egan Escape Productions and Warner Bros. Executives Unveil Escape IT</p>
<p>Egan Escape Productions and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Themed Entertainment are responsible for Escape IT. Peter van Roden, the senior vice president of Warner Bros. Themed Entertainment, shared his enthusiasm for working alongside Egan Escape Productions, stating that their collaboration has elevated the immersive horror experience to new heights.</p>
<p>According to Jason Egan, the owner of Egan Escape Productions, they had a thrilling experience collaborating with Warner Bros. Discovery Global Themed Entertainment. He expressed his excitement in bringing to life some of their iconic characters.</p>
<p>Egan’s company is dedicated to creating the most imaginative and interactive experiences, and their latest project promises to be their most terrifying one yet. The welcoming of visitors by Pennywise the dancing clown into the town of Derry is an unforgettable experience that Egan and his team are eager to share.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Egan Escape Productions has developed other escape rooms inspired by well-known movie franchises such as SAW Escape and Escape Blair Witch.</p>
