<p>Gaming Innovation Group has appointed Ryan Collinge as its new senior vice president of business development for Platform and Sportsbook</p>
<p>Leading iGaming technology company that provides solutions, products, and services to iGaming operators, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), has appointed Ryan Collinge as the new senior vice president of business development for Platform and Sportsbook.</p>
<p>The news comes in the context of the company’s ongoing efforts to improve its commercial expertise and expand the reach of its fresh and revolutionary X-Suite Platform CoreX, Sportsbook SportX, and Artificial Intelligence-led features DataX and LogicX.</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art technology leverages the latest in AI and data-based solutions while aiming to provide safe end-to-end features focused on users that are prone to maximize growth opportunities for operators.</p>
<p>Flawless Reputation as a Senior Figure</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming and Gauselmann Group’s ex-director has built a flawless reputation in the industry, becoming an easily recognizable senior figure over the course of over two decades of experience.</p>
<p>GiG anticipates customer relations expert Collinge will transfer his wealth of commercial success onto them, after spending the past seven years playing a critical role in delivering contracts valued at millions of Euro for Blueprint Gaming and the Gauselmann group online and in the retail world.</p>
<p>Collinge significantly grew his reputation after he helped initiate an MBO of Playnation with Palatine PE prior to exiting the investment to Austria-based strategic buyer Novomatic nine years ago, in 2015.</p>
<p>From his new position of senior vice president of business development for Platform and Sportsbook, Collinge is expected to assist GiG’s highly ambitious strategic commercial initiatives, as highlighted by chief business officer Andrew Cochrane.</p>
<p>Using a smart combination of excellent products, the highest levels of service in the industry, and the brightest and best talent in the industry, GiG plans to strengthen its leading position while extending its worldwide footprint and fostering sustained growth.</p>
<p>GiG will attend the much-anticipated ICE London 2024 held between February 6-8 where it will showcase its complete X-Suite product range on Stand N9-140 at ExCel London.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Collinge described the opportunity to join GiG as “too exciting” to pass up, in the context of the giant growth potential of the business.</p>
<p>He also expressed his excitement regarding the new X-Suite of products and GiG’s plans for the future, adding they will join ICE and walk into the new year “full of ambition and anticipation for what we can achieve together.”</p>
<p>“Another Fantastic Addition” to the Senior Team</p>
<p>Chief executive officer for Platform and Sportsbook at GiG, Richard Carter, spoke about the excellent hires that they have made over the past few months, calling Collinge “another fantastic addition” to their senior team.</p>
<p>Carter added the new SVP’s appointment “will further help propel GiG forward to significantly scale revenue and acquire accomplished new partners.”</p>
<p>The CEO also praised Collinge’s exquisite reputation and solid background in the iGaming world while expressing certainty regarding the way his “high-level knowledge of the industry and strategic approach” will prove to be invaluable assets to the company during the fast growth period.</p>
<p>At the same time, the chief business officer for Platform and Sportsbook at GiG, Andrew Cochrane, described Collinge’s arrival as one that will provide “a fantastic boost” to their efforts to develop the business in the context of the important escalation in interest across all verticals since the successful launch of the X-Suite.</p>
<p>Cochrane also acknowledged Collinge’s expertise and proven track record at attracting commercial successes which he called “undeniably impressive,” explaining his appointment will reaffirm their capacity to attract some of the best talents in the industry.</p>
<p>In December, GiG completed a deal with KaFe Rocks as part of its plans to conquer the casino affiliate sector.</p>
