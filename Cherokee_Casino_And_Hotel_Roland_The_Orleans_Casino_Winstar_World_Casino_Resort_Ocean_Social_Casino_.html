    <h1>Cherokee Casino And Hotel Roland The Orleans Casino Winstar World Casino Resort Ocean Social Casino</h1>

<p>I'm done with online casinos. I interacted with just 2: silveredge and slots7. Both have made things a huge issue and caused me so many problems when anywhere else in the world it wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>I won the no deposit bonus and met all wagering requirements. I told them I don't have utility bills as I live at home. I have been trying to provide proof of address since Feb 23 now. I did everything possible and they always have some excuse. I've sent over 20 emails and can take screenshots of everything.</p>
<p>I also have been pressured to share my personal information. For example, on the statements it's like they can see every possible thing about me on there. That's messed up... for $100? They're pieces of s----.</p>
<p>So I had an account only at Simplii Financial. They wouldn't accept it and i tried so many other documents. I basically just sent them anything I had and none were accepted. Anywhere else in the world you walk in show ID boom. Casino, slots, etc. They say it's a virtual bank since it's online. But it's pretty much the same as any other bank other than they don't have a branch anymore. I don't see the issue.</p>
<p>Anyways, I actually end up opening a new student account. Both a regular and credit at the CIBC. Literally exactly what they asked for. "Regular bank and credit statement with address proof not virtual". I've also posted on Reddit about this and other people that use Simplii and other things told me that they're accepted super easily and with all these methods... ID or Simplii or whatever and its easy elsewhere. I told them about my experiences with Slots7 and Silveredgecasino but I'm going to repost with screenshots.</p>
<p>So I had to wait till April to get the bank statement since I just opened the account. Also, sign up for mail versus email which is pointless nowadays. I call them when it doesn't come in April and they say it takes 7+ business days or you can pay a few bucks at the bank.</p>
<p>So I walk to the bank and explain this all and what a b---- it has been. They told me that the mailed document doesn't show the address anyways. This is Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce like one of the biggest banks ever. What more can they want. I now even have 2 accounts because of these f---ing morons. I kind of wanted to open it anyways but still.</p>
<p>It's definitely not to verify identity. I've sent like 10 different proofs and every possible document. If you go to any place and just show ID it's accepted so not accepting every possible thing over $100 not to mention almost like an invasion of privacy at this point f---ing scammers.</p>
<p>So anyways, I get to the CIBC and she prints the statement they would mail and puts a special stamp on it. She highlights all the info related to me on the document like account number, name, address, etc. on the relevant documents. She told me this document has literally never been verified and is above and beyond because even the mailed or statement doesn't have that information. She also stamps the second part and it shows the bank address every possible thing you can imagine. They can see my phone number, name, address, that I live next to the bank, all my transactions, etc. She also told me it can all be verified officially through those documents so it's the highest form of verification.</p>
<p>I get an email back from them that they couldn't verify the documents. I told them they crossed the line I'm making a complaint and they're scamming me since I've done everything possible.</p>
<p>Read how ridiculous it is what I've gone through.</p>
