<p>Swedish gambling group Betsson AB teamed up with the innovation studio Incentive Games to develop a suite of free games for its Betsafe brand related to its recent launch in Kenya.</p>
<p>Betsafe Kenya Live Since December</p>
<p>Betsafe officially went live in Kenya in December 2020, determined to establish its presence among local sports fans, following on the sponsorship deals the brand signed with the two most popular football teams in the country.</p>
<p>In June, Betsafe came to the rescue to the financially struggling teams of Gor Mahia FC and AFC Leopards SC, signing 3-year sponsorship deals with the two rivals from the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) which were left in a dire financial state after their main sponsor SportPesa terminated sponsorship agreements and left the country.</p>
<p>“Africa is a new region for Betsson and we see its potential as one of the fastest growing online sports betting regions in the world. As with other regions, we are taking a localised approach to the Kenyan market.” Ciara Nic Liam, Product Director, Betsson Group</p>
<p>FTPs an Acquisition Channel</p>
<p>As part of that localized approach, Betsafe believes the offer of free-to-play (FTP) games and paid virtual sports games would be a major channel for the operator to acquire new customers, Ciara Nic Liam continued, hailing the leader role of Incentive Games in the area.</p>
<p>“We look forward to launching its games to our players shortly.” Ciara Nic Liam, Product Director, Betsson Group</p>
<p>Having a proven track record in developing free-to-play game titles for markets in Africa, and currently serving FTP game suites for BtoBet and BetLion, Incentive Games help operators by providing them with a cost-effective customer acquisition and retention tool, while promoting their brands in a secure way.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be aligned with the Betsson Group and providing bespoke free-to-play and pay-to-play games for the Betsafe brand. We do not take a ‘copy and paste’ approach to deliver games for clients.” John Gordon, CEO, Incentive Games</p>
<p>Being selected as a partner by the Stockholm group for its first African sports betting property is a recognition of the excellent work done by Incentive Games and their tailored approach.</p>
<p>“We pride ourselves on providing real value, and we are looking forward to helping another gaming brand launch effectively in the region.” John Gordon, CEO, Incentive Games</p>
<p>Entering a market where bettors recognize no one but SportPesa, Betsafe is well aware how high the bar is raised and that it needs to establish an industry-leading sports betting experience from the very beginning to have a chance to replace the famous operator in the hearts of local sports fans.</p>
<p>Giving them the bespoke suite of games provided by Incentive Games is a certainly good start.</p>
