    <h1>Everygame Casino Twin Arrows Casino Hit It Rich Casino Facebook Casino Strike Rio All Suite Hotel An</h1>

<p>I know very well what KYC is and it has been passed hundreds of times with no problem, unfortunately, this is the first time I met a casino that requires data illegally, I sent them all the required documents like id card, bill, screen skrill, selfie with their casino site in the background, confirmation of deposits and withdrawals from skrill to my bank account, I can easily pass any face / skype verification, I find it idiotic but I have no problem if it is necessary.</p>
<p>unfortunately my skrill account history contains many e-mail addresses of other people who are not customers of this pseudo casino company, including clients with whom I have financial transactions from time to time via skrill as I run a business and cannot share email data as it is illegal.</p>
<p>I offered them to send them all the data, my company NIP, etc., also each my business activities, I told them they could withdraw to my bank account if they see a problem with my skrill account, I can provide them with all the data but only those about me, I cannot share other people's data with a small casino which is not any state institution.</p>
<p>if the company was licensed in the UK gambling commission, I could provide such information, unfortunately the casino has the cheapest curacao sub-license which does not authorize this company to check such information (relating to other people)</p>
<p>unless the company simply doesn't care about the European directives on the GDPR.</p>
<p>I will repeat again, I will be happy to share all the data related to me, including the source of funds, etc., confirmation of deposits on my skrill account, etc.</p>
<p>the more that it is a very small amount and I cannot send this docs to company that does not inspire any trust, and looks to be run by crooks.</p>
