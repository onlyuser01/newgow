    <h1>Marksville La Casino Casino Pechanga Casino English Movie Potawatomi Hotel Casino Planet7 Casino GAN</h1>

<p>Provider of B2B online gaming technology and B2C online betting and gaming, GAN, announced its Coolbet brand is now available in the regulated Mexican market.</p>
<p>Slow and Steady Growth</p>
<p>The launch of GAN’s Coolbet in Mexico made the Latin American country the tenth regulated jurisdiction where the brand acquired by GAN in January 2021 is operational.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, the president of B2C for GAN, Endre Nesset, expressed the excitement and thrill among everyone at GAN “to be live and operating in the regulated Mexican market” by extending Coolbet’s reach to local players.</p>
<p>“We expect our share of the market to grow over time, but initially we expect both investment spend and revenue to be modest, as we gain familiarity with the market,” Nesset continued, emphasizing that the launch in Mexico “has been asset-light, with limited marketing spend focused on targeted social media and digital campaigns.”</p>
<p>As for the near future, Nesset outlined that Coolbet’s efforts will be concentrated on sponsorships to Mexican athletes and streamers to boost brand awareness among the locals and grow the brand’s presence in the market.</p>
<p>Local partnerships for the brand began on January 16 when Coolbet teamed with a locally licensed partner to allow it to use its brand and offer Coolbet as a viable sports betting option to eligible customers in Mexico.</p>
<p>Top-Market Odds, Localized Support</p>
<p>Coolbet is promising its players a unique sports betting experience based on leading products and localized customer service alongside top-market odds and a localized sports betting menu developed by the brand’s in-house team of bookmakers.</p>
<p>Available for wagering will be the most popular sporting events in Mexico and the Latin American region, including the 2023 Mexico Open, MLB Mexico, Copa Libertadores, Copa Sudamericana, Recopa Sudamericana, Formula 1, and many others.</p>
<p>The launch in Mexico marked Coolbet’s tenth jurisdiction of operation to add to the brand’s presence in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Chile, Estonia, New Zealand, Austria, and Germany, and the brand’s second Latin American country of operation.</p>
<p>Operating a gaming site and sportsbook software, the brand headquartered in Tallinn, Estonia, features over 350 employees and holds operating licenses in Estonia, Sweden, Malta, and the Canadian province of Ontario.</p>
<p>Last year, Coolbet joined the International Betting and Integrity Association (IBIA) as one of the organization’s trusted partners to assist it in discovering suspicious betting patterns and undertaking legal action to get rid of corruption and other underhanded tactics.</p>
