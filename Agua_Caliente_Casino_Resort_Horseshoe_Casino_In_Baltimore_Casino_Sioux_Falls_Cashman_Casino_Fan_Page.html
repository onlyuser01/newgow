<p>The land-based sector posted mixed results, showing that it still has a way to go before fully recovering from the pandemic</p>
<p>New Jersey’s gambling and sports betting operators posted $457 million of revenue in June, attesting to the post-COVID recovery of the sector. However, some of the state’s brick-and-mortar casinos are still recovering from the pandemic.</p>
<p>As reported by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the June 2023 period saw the state‘s nine casino hotel properties earn $241.6 million. This figure marks a year-on-year increase of 5.4% from June 2022 when the sector earned $229.1 million. The division added that year-to-date casino win for the nine casino hotels sits at $1.36 billion, which represents a year-on-year increase of 3.5%.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the internet gaming win for the period was $149.3 million. As noted by the regulator, this reflects a growth of 12.1% compared to $133.1 million for 2022. The online gaming sector reported year-to-date revenue of $930.8 million, which represents a solid 14.3% growth from last year’s $814.5 million.</p>
<p>Finally, New Jersey’s sports betting operators and racetracks reported revenue of $66.4 million, which translates into a stellar $69.1% increase from June 2022’s $39.2 million. The gross revenue reported by the companies for the year-to-date sits at $440.8 million, reflecting a $42.8% year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>The Casino Sector Still Has a Way to Go</p>
<p>The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement concluded that total gaming revenue recorded by casinos, racetracks and their partners was $457.2 million for the month. This marks a 13.9% year-on-year increase from June 2022 when the sector recorded total gaming revenue of $401.5 million.</p>
<p>For year-to-date, the total revenue reported by New Jersey’s gambling and betting operators was $2.73 billion, which reflects a year-on-year increase of 12.1% from $2.42 billion reported in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>Despite the favorable results, the retail sector continues to struggle to catch up with its pre-pandemic results. While the total revenue from land-based casinos in the state managed to surpass the pre-pandemic levels, certain casinos recorded lower revenues from in-person gamblers.</p>
<p>For example, Bally’s won $12.4 million from in-person gamblers, representing a year-on-year decline of 8.2%. Meanwhile, Borgata won $60.5 million, a YOY increase of 11.6%. Caesars won $21.4 million, up 11.4%. Golden Nugget, on the other hand, posted $11.8 million, down 6%. Hard Rock’s win from retail gaming also declined by 2.8%, sitting at $43.3 million. Harrah’s won $21 million, representing an increase of 3.8%. Resorts won $15.2 million, representing an increase of almost 11%. Finally, Tropicana won around $21 million, which translates into a decrease of 2%.</p>
<p>The mixed results show that New Jersey’s land-based sector is yet to fully recover from the pandemic.</p>
