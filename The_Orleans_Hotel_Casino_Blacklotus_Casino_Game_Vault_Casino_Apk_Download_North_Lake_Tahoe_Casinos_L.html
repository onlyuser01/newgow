    <h1>The Orleans Hotel Casino Blacklotus Casino Game Vault Casino Apk Download North Lake Tahoe Casinos L</h1>

<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply, finally atleast an official statement from Heybets. But of course this is very weird and my restricted area is/was absolutely not a secret to Heybets.</p>
<p>I came on to Heybets casino threw (.NL) websites, where Heybets was/is advertising for new players from the Netherlands. I asked either your VIP manager as CustomerCare staff, prior to my first deposit if i am welcome to play on Heybets, which they both agreed to (i have saved screenshots from that). Furthermore Heybets accepted my deposits and also let me place bets from (a restriced area), also i already did withdrawals which got accepted and processed before any strange KYC request was sent. Up to 3weeks ago, also the website was accesable from the Netherlands, only after my withdrawal request and my first complaints something was changed on the Heybets website to no longer let Dutch visitors on to the website (Also screenshots from that change are saved). Allthough the casino is still advertising on certain platforms stating you actually do accept players from the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The problem for me being from the Netherlands, only became a problem after winning, and when i wanted to make a bigger withdrawal. There was absolutely no problem to sign-up, to deposit, to play. To me it looks more that you don't accept winnings and nothing to do with not accepting players from a restricted area. Otherwise, just restrict it!</p>
<p>Also i would like to draw to your attention, there are more restriced area's where Heybets actually did the exact same thing to players (just read a few online player reviews). And there are restricted area's where you are still advertising for new players from that specific restriced area. Which basicly makes your policy to take money from everybody and to pay nobody.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no problem with not playing anymore on the Heybets website, once you tell me that players from the Netherlands are not allowed. But then don't accept them signing up, don't accept there deposits and certainly don't accept there bets.</p>
<p>For now i would just like to have my withdrawal request accepted and receive my account balance. Which is actual funds where you accepted bets for (just in case, i have also saved my complete betting history).</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
