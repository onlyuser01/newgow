<p>Data and AI technology market leader Stats Perform has announced a fresh 10-year distribution partnership with the European Handball Federation (EHF).</p>
<p>Stats Perform Enters New Partnership</p>
<p>Stats Perform has announced that it has entered a 10-year partnership to distribute the EHF’s premium club and National Team competitions through its Watch&amp;Bet video streaming service platform.</p>
<p>This agreement is the latest deal from the EHF’s media and marketing rights partnership with Infront and DAZN Group. The deal will bring more than 500 live streamed handball matches every season from the most-watched handball competitions to Stats Perform’s Watch&amp;Bet platform, which in turn opens up the matches to regulated betting.</p>
<p>According to Stats Perform Chief Rights Officer Alex Rice, handball is already one of the leading sports for watching and betting, and its popularity is still growing not just in Europe, but globally. “To have secured competitions like the EHF Champions League and the European Championships (EUROS) for the next ten years enables our sportsbook partners to provide their customers with a seamless, consistent, premium handball betting and streaming experience.”, he said.</p>
<p>EHF to Benefit from Expertise</p>
<p>Over the years, Stats Perform has managed to carve out a name for itself in the competitive and dynamic sports betting market. The company is well-known for its capacity for innovation, particularly through the implementation of AI technology, machine learning and computer vision. The company uses its sophisticated technology to offer better predictions, increased engagement and an overall better fan experience.</p>
<p>And it is this expertise and added value that Stats Perform offers to its clients and partners, and what it will provide to the EHF. The EHF live streams are only the newest addition to Stats Perform’s Watch&amp;Bet platform and join over 100 other competitors that already use the company’s services. Watch&amp;Bet allows licensed sportsbooks to offer high-quality live video streams of a multitude of popular sports to their customers at all times of the day. This includes football, tennis, basketball, cricket, rugby and many more.</p>
<p>The Watch&amp;Bet streaming platform’s video and sports data is distributed to regulated operators, who can use the data and statistics to craft exceptional betting experiences across various platforms, while also ensuring high standards for integrity.</p>
<p>Further Deals and Developments</p>
<p>Stats Perform has had a dynamic year filled with multiple partnerships, acquisitions and deals, of which the partnership with EHF is only the most recent.</p>
<p>Only a few days ago, Stats Perform managed to successfully purchase two powerful AI platforms from Thuuz Sports – a move that is guaranteed to further improve the betting and viewing experience offered by Watch&amp;Bet.</p>
<p>Some other recent highlights include the company’s partnership deal for in-play data with GVC Holding, as well as its title of exclusive betting streaming rights and betting data provider in Brazil.</p>
