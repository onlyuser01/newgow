<p>The leading gaming and hospitality company that operates nearly 30 properties in 10 different US states, Boyd Gaming, announced changes to its senior-level team. The company confirmed in a statement that it promoted four of its senior executives in a move that seeks to propel its organizational structure and strengthen its management team. Ultimately, Boyd Gaming's promotions seek to ensure the company continues to offer supreme services for its guests while at the same time benefiting from long-term growth.</p>
<p>Under the changes to its senior leadership team, the company confirmed the promotion of Ted Bogich for the role of Chief Operating Officer. He was elevated from the role he previously held as Executive Vice President, Operations for Boyd Gaming's Midwest and South region. Filling in the vacant role left by Bogich, the company selected Ward Shaw, who previously served as Senior Vice President, Operations, where he oversaw Boyd Gaming's operations in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois as well as Missouri.</p>
<p>Bogich's career with the company began back in 2004 when he was appointed Vice President and General Manager of Sam's Town Tunica. In 2007, he was appointed Vice President and General Manager of Blue Chip Casino Hotel. Then, in 2012, Bogich was promoted to Senior Vice President, Operations before his appointment as Executive Vice President, Operations in 2016. While he was promoted to Chief Operating Officer, he will also continue to oversee the company's Corporate Marketing, and Slot Analytics and Strategy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Shaw, who succeeds Bogich, is also a seasoned expert. He has more than 25 years of experience within the gaming sector and he first joined Boyd Gaming back in 2018 when he was appointed as Senior Vice President, Operations. Throughout his career, he held important senior-level roles with different multinational gaming companies.</p>
<p>Besides the aforementioned changes, Boyd Gaming confirmed that Steve Thompson, who served as Executive Vice President, Operations for the Nevada region, was promoted to the role of Chief Administrative Officer. The promotion comes as no surprise, considering Thompson's extensive experience with the company and his tenure which started back in 1983. Throughout his career with Boyd Gaming, he held several senior-level roles, providing it with expert advice and knowledge.</p>
<p>Filling the role of Thompson, the company selected Steve Schutte. Before his promotion, Schutte held the role of Senior Vice President, Operations for Boyd Gaming's Las Vegas local properties. Besides his new role that will involve overseeing the company's Nevada properties, Schutte will be in charge of Corporate Slot Operations, Food and Beverage, and Hotel Operations.</p>
<p>Keith Smith, Boyd Gaming's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the topic: "These appointments strengthen our management structure and help position Boyd for today’s dynamic and fast changing environment."</p>
<p>Additionally, he pointed out: "Each of these four accomplished executives has played a critical role in our Company’s success, and through their expanded roles we will further leverage their talent and expertise as we continue to drive long-term growth and efficiencies throughout our operations."</p>
<p>All four of Boyd Gaming's senior executive appointments are with immediate effect.</p>
