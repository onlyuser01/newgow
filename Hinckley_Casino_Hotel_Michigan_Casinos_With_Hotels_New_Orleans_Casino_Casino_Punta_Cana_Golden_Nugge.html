    <h1>Hinckley Casino Hotel Michigan Casinos With Hotels New Orleans Casino Casino Punta Cana Golden Nugge</h1>

<p>I had opened an account with yallabet a while back but finally decided to play with them. Made a few deposits and got lucky. Went through the the verification process which took longer then the 24 hours they said it would take. After finally being verified and was sent an email saying i am now able to make withdrawals i made a withdrawal of 800 cad. Waited and waited for confirmation of my withdrawal but got sent an unpleasant email saying that my withdrawal is still pending and that my account is under investigation and one the investigation is over they would approve my withdrawal. To me this is a way for them to stall and waiting to see if i cancel my withdrawal and lose my winnings. Which i dont know why my account would be under investigation. I will update what happens next</p>
