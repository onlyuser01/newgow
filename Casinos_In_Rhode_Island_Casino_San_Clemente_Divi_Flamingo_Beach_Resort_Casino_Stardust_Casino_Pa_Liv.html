<p>The leading supplier of games for the online gambling industry, Pragmatic Play, announced it expanded its partnership with Gaming1. Details regarding the expanded collaboration emerged Tuesday with the leading iGaming supplier agreeing to deliver games from its Live Casino vertical, powering Gaming1's brand, Circus. As a result, customers of the brand in the Netherlands and Belgium, two important European jurisdictions, will benefit from accessing new games from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The latest announcement takes the collaboration between Gaming1 and Pragmatic Play to a new level.
