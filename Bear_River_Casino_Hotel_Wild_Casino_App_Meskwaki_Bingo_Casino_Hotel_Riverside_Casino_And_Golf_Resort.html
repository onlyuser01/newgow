    <h1>Bear River Casino Hotel Wild Casino App Meskwaki Bingo Casino Hotel Riverside Casino And Golf Resort</h1>

<p>Yes it was the 15th the latest transaction i had stolen from me. What I think you misunderstood maybe I wasn't clear on was that it was a Bitcoin deposit so I have contacted my financial institution to see if we could reverse the transaction but once it is confirmed on the blockchain that this certain wallet address received it there's no way to reverse it and yes I have photographic evidence showing the Black lotus Casino website obviously on my account providing the wallet address for my Bitcoin deposit in both cases and also photos of the confirmation in the blockchain that that exact address received the deposit again the same for both transactions. I don't believe that this is an error or anything glitchy going on I believe it is just a scam of a "casino". My reasoning for believing that to be true is in dealing with my troubles and trying to get them to not only acknowledge the issue going on but I can't even get someone to have a continual conversation about the issue every time I am contacted it is like starting over from step One like they don't have any idea of the stuff I've already sent them they just want me to repeat from the beginning and it's just beyond frustrating. If there was no issues with Bitcoin or crypto deposits then why wouldn't they have anything posted saying that before players attempt to deposit??? They have automated messages as soon as you go to start a chat with one of their team members that say they're aware of the glitches going on with Bitcoin deposit s??? Hmmm? Maybe I'm wrong but to me it seems like I'm being scammed and I might as well kiss the money goodbye but if I can help any other players by sharing what I've gone through so that this doesn't happen to somebody else then at least some good has came from it.</p>
