<p>Dear bell2410,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. First, I’d like to explain to you what the difference is between closing the account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can reopen the account anytime, and the casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances (after the cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who are addicted/with gambling problems).</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that your only reason for the account closure request was missing payment methods? Could you please forward me the account closure requests? My email address is kristina.s@casino.guru. Alternatively, you can post it here.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
