<p>The League of Legends World Championship has kicked off and 22 teams will now try to battle their way to the finals on November 6. With a month until the grand event, we finally have some clarity on what we can expect from team performances.</p>
<p>Following the upset in the game versus FunPlus Phoenix, which we called successfully in September, Edward Gaming is still posted third at (+375) in the overall standing. The odds are going to start changing rapidly on a daily from this point on so you can reference them all at Betway in real-time.</p>
<p>FunPlus is still in the lead by slim (+200) in the overall odds listings. From now through the Group Stage which begins on October 11, we can expect rapid changes in the overall standings. FunPlus may be leaders but they will have to square up against many successful teams, including the defending champions DWG Kia, Royal Never Give Up, and their arch-rivals from Edward Gaming.</p>

<p>The Staying Power of Asian Teams</p>
<p>No other continent can boast the same excellence when it comes to the competitive League of Legends Championship. In the event’s ten editions so far, only one non-Asian team has won with South Korea and China dominating every season.</p>
<p>We should not expect this to change as FunPlus Phoenix won the event in 2019 but at least not too many past winners are posting very high in the current rankings. This means that many eyeballs are now on how DWA KIA and FunPlus are going to perform in the weeks leading up to the World Championship Finals.</p>
<p>While most worlds have come down to the wire between China and Korea in the past, this year it seems like LPL is in the lead with Edward Gaming, FunPlus, and RNGP posting the best odds to win.</p>
<p>Royal Never Give Up is almost priced out based on the current odds with the team posted at (+600) at the time of writing but this doesn’t mean they are going anywhere. Yet, an early bet on RNGP could pay off as the LPL is competitive enough to allow most teams to be perfectly familiar with each other’s quirks and know how to behave and play against one another.</p>
<p>While one team will be definitely dominant, we are bound to see highly-contested series that will never be one-sided and where a game cannot be called too early.</p>
<p>Europe and NA in the Doldrums? Not Entirely</p>
<p>European teams are some of the most accomplished powerhouses when it comes to esports, and yet they have been somewhat absent in the face of Chinese and Korean competitors. For all it’s worth, G2 and Fnatic have been constantly trying to tackle the Worlds and both teams ended up runner-ups in 2019 and 2018 respectively.</p>
<p>Presently, Fnatic is one of the few teams, along with Rogue, that will be representing the region it seems and they are posted at the rather long (+1400). If Fnatic can overcome these odds remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In the meantime, North America is going to send several teams of its own with Cloud9 and Team Liquid seemingly posting the highest chances of success from the region. These two powerhouses are posted at (+5,000) each. 100 Thieves are also there, but all North American organizations are posted as dark horses. Betting even $1 on each of these will bring you tremendous value.</p>
