<p>iGaming solutions provider Aspire Global has joined forces with TrueLayer, the self-proclaimed leader in online banking. As per the agreement, the latter company will supply the provider with innovative payment methods.</p>
<p>Aspire Global Adds TrueLayer Payments to Brands</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal with TrueLayer, Aspire Global will be able to implement the TrueLayer Payments solution to its offerings. As a result, Aspire will be able to enhance its B2B product and improve its brands. TrueLayer will notably supply its new partner’s divisions with robust low-cost payment options that include digital wallets, bank transfers and cards. Thanks to the baking leader, Aspire’s brands will be able to offer secure instant deposits.</p>
<p>The agreement is in line with Aspire Global’s usual hi-tech approach. The company, which has always embraced innovation, will be able to enhance the player experience by providing end clients with robust payment methods.</p>
<p>At first, the deal will cover only Aspire’s business in the United Kingdom. At a later date, the partnership will be expanded to also cover the provider’s offerings in other European markets as well. Customers in these countries will be able to use TrueLayer’s solutions to fund their accounts in mere moments, without the need to manually enter card details or share bank credentials. In addition, TrueLayer’s verification systems will allow verified accounts to make instant withdrawals.</p>
<p>Lastly, one of the best things about TrueLayers is that its integration is white-labeled and uses the operator brand and the player’s chosen bank, without the need for a third-party brand.</p>
<p>A Great Opportunity to Embrace Innovation</p>
<p>TrueLayer’s head of iGaming, Roberto Villani, spoke about his company’s solutions. He noted that many online gambling operators are seeking to lower fees and failure rates. Luckily, TrueLayer offers efficient and cost-effective account-to-account payments powered by open banking that help operators avoid many of these hurdles.</p>
<p>Villani also spoke about the agreement with Aspire Global and said that TrueLayer will be happy to help Aspire’s team offer better experiences to players.</p>
<p>We have gone further to offer operators instant account funding and instant payouts for players. We’re delighted to be working with the Aspire Global team to create a better player experience for its customers. Roberto Villani, head of iGaming, TrueLayer</p>
<p>Aspire Global’s head of ecommerce and payments, Gil Tal, also shared his thoughts.</p>
<p>The partnership with TrueLayer is another step in Aspire Global’s strategy to deliver the best payment experiences to our players. Gil Tal, head of ecommerce, Aspire Global</p>
<p>Tal called open banking a great opportunity for the industry to embrace innovation and improve player trust and retention.</p>
