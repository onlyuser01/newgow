<p>Lottery ticket-selling app Jackpocket announced it has launched operations in Idaho, providing lottery fans in the state with a new way to play their favorite lottery games.</p>
<p>Lucky Number 13</p>
<p>The launch of the third-party app in Idaho is bringing lottery games, including Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto America, Lucky for Life, Idaho Cash, Pick 3, and Pick 4 closer to players, providing a secure way for them to order official state lottery tickets.</p>
<p>The launch in Idaho placed the state along Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Washington DC as the 13th jurisdiction where the Jackpocket app is available for lottery play.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Jackpocket founder and chief executive officer Peter Sullivan associated the launch numerically by finding a new lucky meaning of the number 13, noting that the team at Jackpocket is looking forward to providing Idahoans with a new “digital-forward way to enjoy one of America’s favorite entertainment options.”</p>
<p>Following the launch, lottery players in the state can purchase lottery tickets utilizing the functionalities of the Jackpocket easy-to-use mobile app which allows them to place ticket orders, view an image of their ticket, check the results of lottery draws, as well as receive lottery prizes of up to $599.</p>
<p>The launch will also help the Idaho Lottery boost its sales and over $1 billion contribution to supporting local school districts’ needs since 1992, during times when Powerball and Mega Millions generate a combined $900 million in sales, as the Jackpocket app is expected to attract new players and help drive state revenue.</p>
<p>Making Millionaires, Supporting Sports</p>
<p>The app has brought over $190 million in lottery prizes to date, making 20 people millionaires, and to attract Idahoans to its app, Jackpocket is offering a free first ticket, while new players can receive a $2 lottery ticket just by downloading the app.</p>
<p>Jackpocket is well aware of the close links of lottery and sports and has established partnerships with several professional teams, such as MLB’s New York Mets, Colorado Rockies and Minnesota Twins, as well as NHL’s New York Islanders and NBA’s Dallas Mavericks.</p>
<p>As a member of the National Council on Problem Gambling, Jackpocket is providing lottery players with a range of consumer protection tools on its app, including daily deposit and spend limits, self-exclusion and access to responsible gaming resources via the app.</p>
