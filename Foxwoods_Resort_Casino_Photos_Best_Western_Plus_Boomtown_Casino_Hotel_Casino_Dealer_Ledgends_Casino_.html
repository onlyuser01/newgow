<p>ECA’s chairman described the deal with Clarion as an alliance that his team deeply cherishes</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming has announced an extension of its important partnership with the European Casino Association (ECA), a European trade body for land-based casino companies. As announced, the new deal will run through 2029.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the ECA will continue to host the International Casino Conference (ICC) at ICE, Clarion’s annual trade exhibition. As usual, the conference will launch a day before the main ICE show and will welcome casino leaders from all around the world.</p>
<p>The event is attended by major stakeholders of big companies and executives of some of the best casino operators. As before, the VIP representatives will discuss the latest developments in the sector and the future of the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>For reference, the ICC is a part of the ICE VOX conference and networking program.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Are Delighted to Extend their Alliance</p>
<p>Alex Pratt, Clarion Gaming’s group managing director, commented on the agreement with the ECA, saying that it is an important partner of Clarion. According to him, the association’s presence is integral to ICE, with the ICC being one of the most important events for land-based casino companies.</p>
<p>Pratt attributed some of ICE’s growth to the presence of the ECA and its members at the event.</p>
<p>The fact that ICE continues to grow and continues to attract international thought leaders, influencers and senior buyers is due in no small part to the contributions made by the ECA and its members. Alex Pratt, group managing director, Clarion Gaming</p>
<p>Stuart Hunter, Clarion Gaming’s managing director, also shared his thoughts on the matter, underlining the importance of working with the industry. He said that the cornerstone of ICE’s philosophy is the provision of the “very best professional business environment” for all of the verticals that Clarion serves.</p>
<p>Finally, Erwin van Lambaart, chair of the European Casino Association, said that his party is delighted to continue this partnership. He described the deal with Clarion as an alliance that his team deeply cherishes.</p>
<p>Since its foundation, this collaboration has consistently contributed to the growth and prosperity of the land-based casino industry, supporting the European Casino Association’s efforts to be the voice of the European industry at the national, regional and EU level. Erwin van Lambaart, chair, ECA</p>
<p>Van Lambaart was elected as chair of the association earlier this year, following Per Jaldung’s departure from the position. Back then, van Lambaart promised that he will work with ECA’s members, board and partners on the priorities for the future work of the association – a sentiment reflected in the current deal extension with Clarion.</p>
