    <h1>Doubledown Casino Codes Forum Caesars Casino Michigan Real Money Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Code</h1>

<p>I inform you that this casino withdraws money by bypassing the Mastercard secur check id a couple of times I refused the transaction through the verification APP of my bank and instead the money was still credited to the game account. BUT there is another week I refused a transaction from my bank of 500 euros. After 5 minutes I see the 500 euros disappear from my bank account (the transaction was REJECTED BY ME). Nothing on the casino account. The casino tells me the transaction has been canceled. I open a dispute with my bank and they tell me it will take some time. Today I decide to write to the casino (I state that I closed my account last week for these scams) and I discover that THEY have my money! THEY DID NOT EVEN CONTACT ME! If I hadn't written I stolen forever. Customer support tells me that I need to reopen my account to request a withdrawal. I do so via the chat. They ask me for an absurd amount of documents that I NEVER HAVE NEVER HAD TO SHOW IN OTHER CASINOS (I point out that my dispute is already proof that the bill is mine). I upload the documents and they ask me for other documents (proof that the payments on the gaming account were made with the CREDIT cards THEY ASKED ME TO SEND!). In the meantime they close my account again (and therefore I can no longer upload the documents (I get pissed off like a bull and who wouldn't?) They reopen the account and I send the documents. ! Their customer support told me to have it reopened to carry out the withdrawal procedures. They make fun of me !!! Now these PEOPLE are dangerous and the rating you gave to this casino is DANGEROUS as a scam. I in fact thanks to you I fell for it. I ask you to intervene to request information about my withdrawal (money that did not even have to be in their hands). And I invite you to be more serious with the reviews. 90% of the votes on this site are FALSE. Sorry say it but it is and they are confirmed by the negative reviews of almost all the casinos that you indulge in. When will the customers be finished who will you ask for the reviews?</p>
