    <h1>Casino Wild Horse Pass Az Okada Casino Grand Eagle Casino Casino Point Dive Park Durant Casino Resor</h1>

<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention, we are always willing to discuss situations relating the players and our casino as we try to provide the best gaming environment for all users and continue are incredible relationship with all of our partners.</p>
<p>I see the account closure request was sent for the 3rd of January which when any user makes this request we allow for a period of 24-48 hours for our compliance team to close the account.</p>
<p>Continuing this request a few hours later he asks on our customer service representatives "Where is my cashback" in which we responded that cashback does not apply to blocked accounts.</p>
<p>And then 2 days later he comes to support and states "reopen my account" with the intention of getting the cashback and more bonuses offered.</p>
<p>Following this, he kept asking for cashback and more of the deposit match bonuses that we offer to members.</p>
<p>The user claims to have lost 924 euros but this is false.</p>
<p>From January 6th the user did not lose 924 euros but rather 173 euros but with this 173 euros 32 of the 173 was bonuses that we gave the user.</p>
<p>So in total the user lost $140 during the account open.</p>
<p>The user has deposited $1117 and withdrew $650 and most of the losses occurred before the request of reopening the account.</p>
<p>If you would like we can share screenshots of transaction history, betting history, and data relating the player.</p>
<p>It seems unfair that the user is requesting 924 euros when in fact the user never lost close to that value before the account closure request let alone after the account closure request.</p>
<p>We understand that gambling addiction can be a problem but it is often the case when they reopen the account to earn as many bonuses as they can, maybe they lose some money, and then they complain to request money back so at the end the user makes even more than they have lost.</p>
<p>In this case the user is requesting around 7x more than what was actually lost.</p>
<p>We really enjoyed having eurogalaxy part of our community and this complaint is a surprise from our end as he seemed to enjoyed the platform throughout the entirety of his gameplay.</p>
<p>We hope that all parties understand and we are always here to clear up any situation that arises. We appreciate the request and hope that the supporting information is enough to shed light on the intentions behind it.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Del Oro Casino and Sportsbook Team</p>
