    <h1>Live Casino Hotel Philadelphia Packer Avenue Philadelphia Pa Island Resort And Casino Casino In Bilo</h1>

<p>Wazdan continues to expand rapidly through new and important markets and on the back of this expansion, the company has been doubling down its efforts to make sure that it has the right talent to help it preside over this growth. This is where Bekki D’Agata comes in as commercial director. D’Agata is relinquishing her position as head of sales and business development to step into the new post and support Wazdan where she is needed the most.</p>
<p>Wazdan Remains on a Growth Trajectory in 2022</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Magdalena Wojdyla and Izabela Slodkowska-Popiel have received promotions, bringing the internal talent into strategic posts with the pair becoming head of account management for Europe and head of account management for North America and Latin America respectively, the company confirmed in a press release shared via email.</p>
<p>Aurelia Szymon and Bartlomiej Kubat have been bumped to senior account managers, and the company has already celebrated the 10th anniversary of many of its original employees who were there when Wazdan was only starting to lay the groundwork for one of the most impressive gaming companies. Commenting on her promotion, D’Agata offered her gratitude and thanks to the company and what it has meant working with Wazdan:</p>
<p>It’s great to be part of a global team that is so ambitious in its approach to expansion and innovation, with the senior leadership being consistently reinforced with employees that are dedicated and consistently contribute to Wazdan’s company culture. Wazdan commercial director Bekki D’Agata</p>
<p>This rejuggling comes at a time when Wazdan boasts 47 new employees hired in 2022 so far. According to D’Agata, Wazdan has experienced many successes in the past year and from a commercial standpoint, the company is posed to advance and grow even further. Much of this is owed to Wazdan’s client-centric approach, D’Agata assures.</p>
