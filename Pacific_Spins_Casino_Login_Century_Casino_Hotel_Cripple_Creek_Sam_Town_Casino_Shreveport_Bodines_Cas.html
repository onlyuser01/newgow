<p>FanDuel, a leading iGaming company in North America and an official betting partner of the NFL, has once again teamed up with its long-time partner Rob Gronkowski to produce the sequel to last year’s Kick of Destiny.</p>
<p>Kick of Destiny 2, according to FanDuel’s official announcement, will see four-time Super Bowl Champion Gronkowski make his way to Las Vegas and attempt to successfully make a field goal just before the start of the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Kay Adams who hosts FanDuel TVs Up &amp; Adams show will serve as commentator during Gronkowski’s next “shot at destiny.”</p>
<p>Kick of Destiny 2 will boast a new interactive element that allows customers to make a free pick on whether they think Gronkowski will Make or Miss the kick. The promotion will be available through the FanDuel Sportsbook app and will provide eligible customers who pick correctly with an equal share of a stellar $10,000,000 in bonus bets.</p>
<p>Gronkowski Wants a Shot at Redemption</p>
<p>Gronkowski features in FanDuel’s new Kick of Destiny 2 ad where a shabbier version of him can be seen walking through the desert and regretting last year’s missed kick. However, Gronk gets saved by his new coach, Carl Weathers, who believes that this year will be different. John Cena will also participate in the campaign, rooting for Gronkowski to fail.</p>
<p>Rob Gronkowski commented on the new Kick of Destiny campaign, admitting that his previous miss devastated him. Because of that, he told FanDuel that he needs a shot at redemption.</p>
<p>I’m going to show America I can make that kick, even with all the pressure of doing it live in front of the entire country. No wind is going to stop me, and we’re going through the uprights this year for everyone who picks that I’m going to make the kick. Rob Gronkowski</p>
<p>John Cena also commented on the campaign, saying that he is excited to “play the villain” since this is a role he rarely gets to play.</p>
<p>I remember watching Gronk’s kick last year and am so excited to be working with a brand like FanDuel to make this sports moment more exciting for their fans, but do I think he’s going to make it? No chance! John Cena</p>
<p>Andrew Sneyd, FanDuel’s executive vice president of marketing, also commented on the matter, saying that last year’s campaign saw “tremendous engagement” from the company’s customers. Sneyd is looking forward to engaging NFL fans once again this year. In the meantime, he praised Gronkowski for his passionate, entertaining and trailblazing persona, saying that he is a perfect fit for FanDuel.</p>
<p>This is not Gronk’s first venture together with FanDuel. A few months ago, the famous NFL player teamed up with the gambling powerhouse for a new game called Gronk Spike Cornhole.</p>
