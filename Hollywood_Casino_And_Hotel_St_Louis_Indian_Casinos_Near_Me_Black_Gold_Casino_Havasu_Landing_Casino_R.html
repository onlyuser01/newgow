    <h1>Hollywood Casino And Hotel St Louis Indian Casinos Near Me Black Gold Casino Havasu Landing Casino R</h1>

<p>Thank you, Sabin Alexandru, for your reply.</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.casoo.com/en/static-texts/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>"Your Account must be registered in Your own, correct, name and personal details and it shall only be issued once for You and not duplicated through any other person, family, household, address (postal or IP), email address, Access Device or any environment where Access Devices are shared (e.g. schools, workplaces, public libraries etc) and/or account in respect of the Services. Any other accounts which You open with us, or which are beneficially owned by You in relation to the Services shall be "Duplicate Accounts". We may close any Duplicate Account (but shall not be obliged to do so)."</p>
<p>Please understand, that it is strictly forbidden, in the majority of the casinos, to have more than one account per IP address or household. There’s an important principle that says, "ignorance of the law is no excuse". It means that you can’t defend your actions by arguing you didn’t know they were illegal or forbidden, even if you honestly did not realize you were breaking the rules.</p>
<p>If you have won and there were funds being held by the casino we would intervene and try to negotiate. Unfortunately, you have played and lost your funds.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint as unjustified. I wish I could be of more help. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
