    <h1>Virgin River Casino Mesquite Nevada Gulfport Casinos Foxwood Casino Connecticut Penn Casinos Tampa C</h1>

<p>So on June 16 I received an email from CAFECASINO telling me about a promo they were offering for 200 free spins with an 80 dollar deposit as well as 100 free spins for 50 and 50 free spins for 20 on the game GOLDEN BUFFALO @ .40 forty cents per spin. I make me deposit of 80 dollars it says I have 200 spins. Now mind you in a daily casino player and have been screwed on promos before by not reading the fine print or the rules etc so I go out of my way to do so now prior to making the deposit. The only thing related to anything about a restriction or play thru or max spin or max win amount is a message on the email that states "what’s the catch" followed by "there is none" verbatim states that yeah ? Ok fine so I start up the game start my spins and as I reach spin 12, a message appears stating that I had reached my maximum win amount of 20 yes twenty dollars . I’m like wait what? Who in their right mind would of ever agreed to that promotion if the max cash out was 20 bucks? That’s not even remotely worth it or fair or logical like how wouldn’t you win over 20 with that many spins ? But sure enough it ended my game. I have screen shots of the site rules the bonus description the email and the dialogue I’ve had with two different supervisors both admitting to the misleading false advertisement used to lure customers into making a deposit and then bait and switching them after it’s too late. They have since sent out a site email stating " just a heads up the max cash out for the free spins is 20 bucks" which was sent out on the 17th more than 24 hrs after the fact solely as a way to try and save their asses if anyone else were to call them on their shady unethical scam they’re running. I offered to allow them to make things right and award me my remaining spins (188 ) or a comparable cash amount to which they replied they could offer me 35 dollars with a play thru requirement to which I laughed and turned down warning them to to fact that I was going to expose them globally to every platform I could find as well as social media review sites reddit .. you name is as well as reporting them to the gaming commission of curaçao and lastly my attorney to seek damages for the grief this has caused me. I hope that as many people as humanly possible see this inquiry and think twice before EVER signing up for this scam site or if you already have, not being fooled by their shady grimey twisted lies and manipulations. They are awful awful people and deserve everything they have coming to them I will provide any and all proof of this for everyone to see! Save your money and your integrity and stay far away from these crooks.. these criminals... you have been warned !</p>
