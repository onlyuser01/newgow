<p>DraftKings announced today an internal promotion that saw long-serving Stephanie Sherman assume the role of chief marketing officer to consolidate all marketing functions in the business under her leadership.</p>
<p>All-Round Marketing Executive</p>
<p>Sherman, who was one of the first employees of Boston-based DraftKings when she joined in 2013, would be responsible for future marketing efforts, providing oversight of the brand and agency campaigns, media buying, and influencer strategy, as well as other functions.</p>
<p>“When I started at DraftKings nine years ago, there was a genuine and collective sense that we were building something special, and zooming out to today, that has been validated more than I could have ever imagined. For all the accomplishments we’ve celebrated and adversity we’ve overcome, I take on this new position knowing there is still so much opportunity ahead along with brilliant people ready to deliver.” Stephanie Sherman, Chief Marketing Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>An instrumental team member since the early days of the daily fantasy and sports betting operator, Sherman stepped into the chief marketing officer role from the position of Senior Vice President of Marketing with a focus on customer acquisition and direct response marketing, two areas where industry competition is intense as operators seek to acquire market share in real-money gaming.</p>
<p>Marketing Industry Recognition</p>
<p>Having helped the business expand for nearly a decade to include sports betting, online casino gaming and digital collectibles, besides daily fantasy sport, as well as provide increasingly savvy and data-driven performance, Sherman received for two years in a row Adweek’s recognition as one of the “Most Powerful Women in Sports.”</p>
<p>“Since our early days as an insurgent daily fantasy business, Stephanie has been a driving force of our growth and contributed hugely to DraftKings becoming a household name and a global, multi-product digital entertainment company enjoyed by millions of consumers.” Matt Kalish, Co-Founder and President, DraftKings North America</p>
<p>Sherman, who managed acquisition marketing for its previous employer, Vistaprint, became the latest member of DraftKings’ executive team and will be responsible for further optimization of the company’s marketing capabilities to facilitate its transformation into a multi-brand organization.</p>
<p>“Stephanie’s consistently strong performance has earned the respect of the entire DraftKings team and she is recognized as one of our industry’s most dynamic marketing minds. I am thrilled to elevate Stephanie as our Chief Marketing Officer and gain her integral perspective within our executive leadership team,” Kalish added.</p>
