<p>FunFair Games has broken ground into the Belgium iGaming market for the first time. The innovation-driven supplier of iGaming content has been able to sign a distribution partnership with Napoleon Casino, which puts the company in a strong position to introduce its proprietary games to Belgian players and help scale its regional presence.</p>
<p>FunFair Games Makes Important First Step in Belgium</p>
<p>FunFair Games has focused a big chunk of its development efforts on social and multiplayer experiences. As a result, the company has been developing games that bring players together in a multi-player setting where a bit of competition between individuals helps keep the action going and game satisfaction high. FunFair Games commercial director Carlo Cooke welcomed the opportunity to work with Napoleon Casino.</p>
<p>He added that the launch of non-traditional content with a market leader was precisely what FunFair Games needed to continue expanding its reach in new and regulated markets. Cooke is looking forward to a strong start in Belgium.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Belgian players will have access to Astroboomers TURBO!, Hugo: Up and Away, and Five Ball Fiesta, among other top-performing titles. This entry is crucial for the supplier as well, as it clearly demonstrates FunFair Games’ ambition to grow in Europe and create even better opportunities for players across regulated markets.</p>
<p>Owned by Superbet Group, Napoleon Casino is a good and reliable partner for FunFair Games. Napoleon is respected by local players who are constantly seeking out its online products, among which will now be FunFair Games. The games will launch through Games Global, which will facilitate the partnership launch.</p>
<p>“We’re always keeping a finger on the pulse to ensure we offer our customers the most in-demand content,” said Napoleon Casino gaming content manager Melissa Deboelpaep. She added that the company has been following FunFair Games’ past ventures and confirmed that the casino was very much pleased to move forward with this content opportunity that will undoubtedly yield benefits to players at Napoleon.</p>
