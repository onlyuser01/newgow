<p>Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians adds GAN as software partner</p>
<p>The company will provide the tribal operator with Simulated Gaming software</p>
<p>GAN and Agua to launch the product in Q1, 2020</p>
<p>Renown casino software developer has inked a fresh gaming partnership with California-based tribal operator Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians.</p>
<p>GAN Brings Gaming Software to Agua Caliente’s Casinos</p>
<p>On Tuesday, October 15, GAN PLC announced a new gaming software partnership with California-based casino operator, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians.</p>
<p>GAN refrained from revealing any financial detail regarding the operation, but the companies are likely to begin software roll-out as early as Q1, 2020.</p>
<p>Agua Caliente Banda has a significant footprint in the U.S. iGaming and gambling verticals, numbering the 15th-largest operator in the country and the sixth-largest tribal operator.</p>
<p>The tribe owns Agua Caliente Casino and Indian Canyons Golf Resort located in Palm Springs, California and Agua caliente Resorts Casino Spa in Rancho Mirage, also in California.</p>
<p>GAN Chief Commercial Officer Jeff Berman welcomed the news and praised the operator for choosing to work with the company and make use of the Simulated Gaming solution:</p>
<p>“Southern California is a significant regional US gaming market, with the largest population concentration in the US, reinforcing GAN’s market position as the leading B2B enterprise software.”</p>
<p>A similar sentiment was expressed by Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians CIO Bill Olivier who had this to say about the choice of GAN as the operator’s latest partner:</p>
<p>“We selected GAN for its proven success in helping casino properties launch online gaming and for its ability to embed our on-property rewards program into an online experience. Equipped with GAN’s Simulated Gaming, we will now introduce our casino properties online to a wider audience of casino enthusiasts located in adjacent regional markets.”</p>

<p>This is a second big development for the tribal operator, after the company received the go-ahead from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to build a third casino property in Palm Springs, California.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, Chairman at the Bureau of Indian Affairs Jeff Grubbe highlighted the benefits of pushing ahead with a third project.</p>
<p>Congratulations Cathedral City on the groundbreaking of your new fire station today. We are honored to support the construction of this new state-of-the-art facility.https://t.co/dDw4VAxiSs — Agua Caliente (@AguaCalienteNDN) October 11, 2019</p>
<p>According to Grubbe, the construction around the casino would revitalize an undeveloped property and boost Cathedral City’s economy, plus create further job opportunities.</p>
<p>California already has a strong presence in the land-based gaming market. In Bakersfield, as Southern California is referred to, the number of physical casinos has reached 60, signalling strong demand for gambling products.</p>
<p>The Golden State’s tribal operator have a strong grasp on the casino economy and remain the dominant force in the state insofar as casinos are concerned.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, October 14, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians signed a new milestone sponsorship with NFL franchise Raiders and became a founding partner of the newly-built Allegiant Stadium which will host the team when it’s completed on time for the 2020 NFL season.</p>
