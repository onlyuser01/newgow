    <h1>St Joe Frontier Casino Boat Casino Near Me Fortunes Casino Sam S Town Hotel And Casino Shreveport Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Robert,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I fully understand how difficult the whole situation must be for you. I carefully checked the Bonus Terms on the website, and this is what I found https://www.orientxpresscasino.com/en/tnc:</p>
<p>„ Betting Rules</p>
<p>16.1. The casino expects you to follow the rules of each game while playing at the casino. We reserve the right to withhold any withdrawals and/or confiscate the winnings and bonuses for violation of the Betting Rules.</p>
<p>16.2. If a player attempts to gain an unfair advantage over the casino by using gaming strategies such as ‘Martingale’ and it is reasonably evident, then the casino will take action including the confiscation of winnings and bonuses.</p>
<p>16.3. When a player receives a bonus, additional betting rules may be applied. These are defined in the Bonus and Promotion Terms and Conditions or are defined in the specific terms and conditions of that promotion.</p>
<p>16.4. Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the deposit currently in play is prohibited."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if the casino shares all the relevant information on its website, there is not much I can do for you in this matter. I understand that it would be easier for the players if the maximum bets were controlled and enforced by the casino during the bonus play, but, unfortunately, that is not a common practice yet. It is not unusual for casinos, to put restrictions on the bonus play (restricted games, game providers, maximum bet etc.)</p>
<p>Are you aware of placing single bet higher than the maximum allowed? Could you please confirm that you have deposited €200 in one transaction? If yes, have you placed a single bet greater than €60? Please forward your game history to petronela.k@casino.guru. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
