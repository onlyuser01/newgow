    <h1>Isle Casino Casino Niagara Ontario Wyoming Casinos Laughlin Nevada Casino Illinois Casino Ranking of</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm glad you're asking. First of all, when you look at the casino, you can see all the considered factors in the "Reputation explained" tab https://casino.guru/BoVegas-Casino-review#tab=js-tab-reputation</p>
<p>Secondly, there' a whole article describing how we rate the casinos: https://casino.guru/our-casino-reviews</p>
<p>Regarding the user reviews: I can tell you it's pretty complicated. Many players break the casino's terms and conditions (for example they create 10 accounts in order to get a no deposit bonus for a registration), then they're winnings are voided for breaking the rule, but they'll still come to write a bad review on the casino.</p>
<p>Speaking about the complaints section, it's a very different story. The player needs to prove they're right and the casino needs to show evidence in order to defend against the accusations. Speaking about user reviews - anyone can write anything about the casino and in case there's no abusive language used in the review and the text makes some sort of sense, the review is approved.</p>
<p>There are also players who give 0 stars to a casino only because they're waiting for a withdrawal and once they receive it, they don't come back to change the review. There are always more people who come to give the casino a bad review, but those who are satisfied with the casinos services, they mostly won't come to write the review.</p>
<p>I know that some casinos are very upset about the reviews they get from players and they contact us regarding it. On the other hand, we wanted to give the community of players a chance to express their opinion about the casinos no matter if they're right or wrong.</p>
