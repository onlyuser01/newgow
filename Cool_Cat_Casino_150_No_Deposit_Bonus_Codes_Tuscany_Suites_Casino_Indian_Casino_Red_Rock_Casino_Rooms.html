<p>Before you play online poker for real money, you will probably want to find out a thing or two about whether poker is legal in the USA. The short answer is yes, you can participate in poker tournaments and cash games legally. There is no law that prohibits players from paying buy-ins to enjoy tournaments or cash games at a poker site that is accessible to them.</p>
<p>In terms of what laws operate, some states have better-established frameworks that allow online poker for real money in full capacity. For example, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada all host websites locally but also allow players to join various cash games.</p>
<p>These states are known as regulated poker jurisdictions where online poker for real money is put on a pedestal. However, if you happen to reside elsewhere in the United States, you can similarly access the best online poker sites.</p>
<p>The only difference here is that you may happen to play at a different but equally good brand than its counterparts in NJ, MI, PA, or NV. You will always be able to play online poker legally and find some great shared liquidity options available to you at the best card rooms we recommend.</p>
