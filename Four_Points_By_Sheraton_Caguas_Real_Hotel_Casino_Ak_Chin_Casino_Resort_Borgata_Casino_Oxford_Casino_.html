    <h1>Four Points By Sheraton Caguas Real Hotel Casino Ak Chin Casino Resort Borgata Casino Oxford Casino</h1>

<p>Since Saturday morning, the 20th of August, I've been trying to request a withdrawal and I can't do it!</p>
<p>I made the deposit using a method available for both deposits and withdrawals! I played! I won! When I went to request the withdrawal, a few hours later, the method was not available! They advised me to make another deposit, using a different method, one that was also available for withdrawals! I followed the guidance! I made a new deposit! I gambled more than the coefficient they gave me! I tried requesting the withdrawal a few times and they kept cancelling it! Finally, on Saturday night, after reaching out countless times via chat, they approved the withdrawal! According to their withdrawal policy, it was supposed to be done instantly or it could take up to 15 minutes! 2 hours later... Through the chat, they told me that the period was actually 5 days! That I should wait! Today, Wednesday, the 23rd of August, in the afternoon, they cancelled it! Claiming technical issues! They asked me to request it again "later"! Since then... I've tried about three times this evening, and they keep cancelling it, giving the same reason they did on Saturday morning! That it has to be done through the same method as the deposit! And they advised me to make another deposit using an alternative method! Even though the pix is still not showing up as a withdrawal option! And I'm requesting the withdrawal using the same method as the new deposit, following their instructions!!!</p>
