<p>Dear Yannick ,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus Terms and Conditions and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"2.6. Different games and game types contribute towards fulfilling wagering requirements to different extents. For instance, if a game type delivers 100% towards wagering, it means that if you bet €1, €1 will count towards completion of the wagering.</p>
<p>Below are the games’ bonus wagering contribution rates:</p>
<p>• Slot games: 100% (aside from list below which we reserve the right to update and forfeit any winnings if bonus funds are wagered on these games.)*</p>
<p>• All other games: 0%</p>
<p>*With an active bonus the following games are strictly forbidden to play, Table Games, Video Poker, Jackpot Games(Games from the Jackpots Section included), Live Casino and the following slot games: 1429 Uncharted Seas, Big Bad Wolf, Blood Suckers, Bonanza, Castle Builder, Castle Builder 2, Da Vinci's Treasure, Dead or Alive, Dead or Alive 2, Eggomatic, Hellboy, Hot Spin, Immortal Romance, Jackhammer 2, Jammin Jars, Jingle Spin, Jungle Spirit, Koi Princess, Lost Relics, Lucky Angler, Madame Destiny, Moon Princess, Peking Luck, Reactoonz, Rich Wilde and the Tome of Madness, Rise of Olympus, Robin Hood - Shifting Riches, Scrooge, Secret of the Stones, Secrets of Atlantis, Sinbad, Sushi Bar, Sweet Bonanza, Sweet Bonanza Xmas, The Dog House, Turn Your Fortune, Twin Spin, Victorious, Vikings, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, Wild Swarm, SugarPop, Danger High Voltage, Ozzy Osbourne, Razor Shark, Wild Frames, Aztec Bonanza, Lil Devil, The Dog House Megaways, Who wants to be a millionaire mystery box, Dark Joker Rizes, Reactoonz 2, Le Kaffee Bar, Beautiful Bones, Cherrypop, Deadwood, Jokerizer, San Quentin Xways, Caribbean Anne, Golden Beauty, Bronco spirit, Dragon Kingdom Eyes of Fire, 5 Families, Book of 99, Jammin Jars 2, Tombstone RIP. In case that this is breached the bonus and any potential winnings derived from the bonus will be forfeited."</p>
<p>However, we believe that restricted games should be blocked, and this rule enforced at software level, i.e., that the casino's software or website shouldn't let players place bets on the games that are not allowed to be played.</p>
<p>Could you please forward your game history along with any relevant communication to nikolas.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve your problem as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Nick</p>
