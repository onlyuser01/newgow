<p>Several snooker players have been suspended for allegedly breaching the rules concerning match-fixing. In the midst of an ongoing investigation, several players, including the former Masters champion Yan Bingtao, have been suspended.</p>
<p>Bingtao May Have Fixed Matches</p>
<p>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) is investigating allegations of match-fixing and, as a result, has suspended several players. Yan Bingtao, one of the most notable players the association penalized, will be unable to compete in the World Snooker Tour until the investigation has concluded.</p>
<p>After the WPBSA finishes its investigation, Bingtao and his fellow players’ suspensions will either be lifted or continued if they are deemed to be guilty. Still, the players were allowed to appeal the current suspension.</p>
<p>Bingtao is currently considered the 16th-best snooker player in the world and is one of the rising stars of professional snooker. Aged 22, Bingtao, also known as “The Tiger,” is a promising young player who upset John Higgins in the 2021 Masters final. This cemented Bingtao as the first debutant to win the tournament since 2008.</p>
<p>Five More Chinese Players Were Sanctioned</p>
<p>Bingtao isn’t the only suspended player who has been accused of match-fixing. Other Chinese players, including Lu Ning, Li Hang, Zhao Jianbo, Bai Langning and Chang Bingyu, were also banned from attending or competing during the World Snooker Tour.</p>
<p>Similarly to Bingtao, the aforementioned professionals will be unable to compete in the World Snooker Tour until the investigation is completed or subsequent charges are brought (or not). The five players are also allowed to try and appeal the decision.</p>
<p>This wave of suspensions follows an October case when the WPBSA found out that Liang Wenbo, another Chinese player, may have manipulated the outcomes of snooker matches for betting purposes. Following that, the association launched an investigation, which it has now expanded to probe into other pro snooker players as well.</p>

<p>BetVictor’s generosity was welcomed by Steve Dawson, the chairman of the World Snooker Tour. Dawson said that the bonus offered by the company will further incentivize the players to give their best.</p>
