<p>In a strategic move aimed at enhancing its casino offerings and driving profitability by fiscal year 2025, PointsBet Canada has appointed Brooke Hilton as its new Head of Casino. Hilton, a seasoned professional with over a decade of experience in the North American regulated iGaming industry, brings a wealth of expertise to her new role.</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada Gains a Strategic Edge with Brooke Hilton’s Expertise</p>
<p>Brooke Hilton, a native of Vancouver, previously worked with Ingenuity Gaming and Bally’s Interactive, where she served as Director of Business Development and Director of iGaming Product for North America, respectively. Additionally, she spent seven years with the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, honing her skills as a slot and tables product manager for the online casino and product specialist for the online casino.</p>
<p>Expressing her excitement about the new role, Hilton shared her enthusiasm on LinkedIn, stating: “It is with immense joy that I announce the beginning of my journey as the head of casino at PointsBet. I have dedicated myself to the Canadian iGaming industry for the past 10-plus years. I’m absolutely thrilled to align my passion with a company as influential as PointsBet Canada.”</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada’s decision to bring Hilton on board underscores the company’s commitment to staying ahead in the competitive Canadian market. Hilton’s extensive experience in managing casino operations and developing localized commercial strategies aligns perfectly with PointsBet Canada’s vision for growth.</p>
<p>As the company continues to expand its footprint in Ontario, Hilton’s expertise is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of PointsBet Canada’s casino offerings. With Hilton at the helm, PointsBet Canada is well-positioned to navigate the complex regulatory landscape and deliver innovative and engaging casino experiences to its customers.</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada Surges Amidst Ontario’s Booming iGaming Market</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada’s decision to appoint Hilton comes at a pivotal time for the company. The Ontario market, where PointsBet Canada currently operates, has shown promising figures in the recently released Q2 FY (2023-24) market performance report. During this period, Ontario witnessed a significant increase in total wagers, reaching CAD14.2 billion ($10.4 billion), up from CAD14 billion ($10 billion) in Q1. The majority of the revenue, CAD11.9 billion ($8.6 billion) in wagers, came from the casino vertical, including slots, bingo, and table games. There were 943,000 active accounts during this period, with an average monthly spend per active player being CAD191 ($140).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PointsBet, operating in Australia and North America, reported a slight 3% decrease in its total sports betting handle, which amounted to AUD611.0 million ($387.5 million) for Q1 FY24. This decline followed the sale of its US assets to Fanatics for $225 million. Despite the dip, the company experienced an 18% increase in total net win, reaching AUD58.2 million ($36.9 million) year-over-year.</p>
<p>Notably, PointsBet’s operations in Canada showcased significant growth, with a 111% increase in turnover to AUD44.2 million ($28 million) and a 212% rise in total net win to AUD5.4 million ($3.4 million) during the same period. PointsBet’s CEO, Sam Swanel, expressed optimism about the company’s profitable path and emphasized Canada’s attractiveness as a market, surpassing certain regions in the United States.</p>
