    <h1>Niagara Falls Ny Casino Hollywood Casino Joliet Il Casino In Murphy North Carolina Casino Night Outf</h1>

<p>The Broncos vs Chargers is one of the longest-running rivalries in the NFL, established back in 1960. The Broncos lead the all-time series 70–54–1, but the Chargers have been pretty good at home, especially since moving to Los Angeles from San Diego. In LA, they’re 3-2 since 2017, but their record at their new home arena – SoFi Stadium – is 2-0.</p>
<p>The same is the place where the Broncos vs Chargers clash of Week 6 will take place on Monday. Are we going to see the Chargers get their third win over the Broncos at SoFi Stadium? To see what we think, make sure to read our MNF preview.</p>

<p>The Broncos Offense Keeps Failing Them</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos are 2-3 in the 2022 NFL season, which is far from a good record, but they should feel lucky for winning two games considering how disastrous their offense has been. With 75 points scored in five games, they have the second-least productive offensive team in the conference.</p>
<p>The reason why this is so surprising is that their signal-caller in 2022 is Russell Wilson, who came to Colorado as a man meant to lift the Broncos to a whole new level. He moved from Seattle for a hefty fee, but so far, he hasn’t shown he’s worth his paycheck.</p>
<p>The worst thing is that he probably won’t do much in the MNF game either, considering that his team is facing super-motivated Chargers.</p>
<p>The Chargers Determined to Grab a Win on MNF</p>
<p>Excluding the poor performance in Florida in Week 3 when they lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Los Angeles Chargers have been excellent in the 2022 season. They are 3-2, with wins over the Las Vegas Raiders, Houston Texans, and Cleveland Browns.</p>
<p>In addition to losing to Jags, they also lost to the Kansas City Chiefs. It’s not embarrassing to lose to Mahomes &amp; Co., especially not at Arrowhead and especially not by just three points.</p>
<p>The key to the Chargers’ success in 2022 is their superb offense. These guys have scored a total of 122, which makes their offensive team the 6th most productive in the AFC. Even more important is the fact that their scoring average in the last two games is 32.0.</p>
<p>Broncos vs Chargers Prediction</p>
<p>The Broncos are poor in the offense in 2022, but their defense is good as usual. Still, the question is whether they’re good enough to stop Justin Herbert and his teammates in the TNF game. We think they aren’t. We think the Chargers are going to destroy them in Week 6.</p>
<p>Picks: Los Angeles Chargers to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
