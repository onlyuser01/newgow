    <h1>Paysbig Potawatomi Bingo Casino Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel Casino Fandango Carson City Nv Ame</h1>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I was playing Da Vinci Diamonds Quadruple on the 17th of May for a long time with bet Â£0.20. After numerous bets, I completed the first progression bar that gives you double items on one icon. This happened around 17:15 or later. After one spin of that event I won a bonus game (this means that during this game , double icons would appear and thus, more winnings) . The bonus game welcomed me and at that time I went for some minutes away. When I returned the game was gone. I loggen in again and I assumed that the game would redirect me to the bonus game I left open. This never happened. I played once or twice just to make sure that the game would give me the bonus. Again ,nothing happened. I contacted the support and they adviced me to delete cookies , clear all the internet windows and restart tha mobile. I did all but still nothing happened. They informed me that they would send the complaint to the team that deals with that matters. The thing is no that when I opened my history to search for my spins , I realised that more than an hour of gambling was missing- like I never played any games for more than an hour- which this is definitely not the case as the bonus game came at the end of this hour ( history missing from around 16:10 until 17:18 pm) and the next spin I could see was the first spin I gambled when I re started the game after the incident occurred. I don't want to be suspicious but I played a long time and it is to wonder why my game history is gone for all that time I basically was trying to hit the progress bar ..</p>
<p>They said they would inform me but I would be very glad to know your opinion as this looks not innocent to me ..</p>
