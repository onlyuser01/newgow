<p>Easing COVID-related restrictions resulted in an increase in gross gaming revenue (GGR) for the gaming industry in the Philippines. Judging by recent figures released by PAGCOR, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, the industry is on its way to rebound, after seeing GGR for the calendar year (CY) 2021 surpass $2 billion.</p>
<p>Philippine Industry on Its Way to Financial Rebound</p>
<p>PAGCOR announced its CY 2021 results, outlining that GGR for the gaming industry hit PHP 131 billion ($2.2 billion). Compared to pandemic-impacted 2020 when revenue halted at PHP 98 billion ($1.9 billion), an increase of 14.5% is observed. Moreover, the results for last year were further boosted by the easing of COVID-related restrictions.</p>

In contrast, during 3Q GGR halted at PHP 26.9 billion ($505 million) and in 2Q was even worse with PHP 21.7 billion ($421 million). Overall, 4Q was the strongest quarter followed by 1Q with PHP 30 billion ($582 million).</p>
