    <h1>Rising Star Casino Resort Rising Sun Greenbrier Casino Prism Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Seminole</h1>

<p>Hi I have made a deposit of 100kr with 100kr bonus so I had 200kr in total ..</p>
<p>I had the luck with me to start with coming up with an amount of approx. 15,000 when I then tried to pay out it could not be done because it is all on my Bonus Balance .. so I contacted live chat and he told me that. I had to wager 25 times my bonus amount 100 * 25 = 2500kr ... on slots</p>
<p>so I did when I could see the legacy of dead was inside the slots ..</p>
<p>then I had Luck with me again and won DKK 145,000</p>
<p>so now I thought I would pay out my money but the whole amount was still under bonus so I wrote to the chat again and explain ag I had played on games under the category slots .. customer service employee then wrote back that the 100kr should be saved played on a slots but it not wrong to play Play'n Go provider and I had to try on another video slots so I did and I quickly get rid of the 100 bonus which had to be played through 25 times to meet the Bonus required .. and now all money was in cash balance. .</p>
<p>I then chose to pay out DKK 150,000.</p>
<p>and then the problem came the withdrawal payout and wrote st they had to watch the game again and that was normal when it was such a high amount ..</p>
<p>today I got an email and my account is closed and I will not get my winnings !!</p>
<p>Since they think I have not complied with the bounce game that you can make a maximum deposit of DKK 50 per spin on the deposit bonus .. they refer to this link .. https://www.onecasino.com/promotions/deposits</p>
<p>but the link they refer to in the email where they close my account is not the same bonus I got. because here you only have to turn over the bonus amount 10 ...</p>
<p>but when I wrote with the customer service staff he sent me this link https://www.onecasino.com/information/bonuses</p>
<p>and here it does not say anything about the maximum deposit per spin .. it just says that I must wager 25x the bonus amount 100 = 2500kr</p>
<p>I was then inside and looking under bouns and could see that I had now turned over 100% 100X25 = 2500</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>it is so bad style from one casino to close my account and without paying out my my winnings 150,000</p>
<p>but they sure also very upset that I was so lucky to get so high for 100kr</p>
