    <h1>Inn Of The Mountain Gods Resort Casino Mescalero Casino Miami Photos Casinos Lake Charles Dreams Cur</h1>

<p>Good evening, something like that is not true, let's start from the beginning since they say it is a good casino and that it has a great performance!!</p>
<p>1: as a serious company the provider of gambling games.. when I made my first withdrawal they canceled it without even knowing why they canceled it!! Even the Live chat is just to exist it doesn't help you anywhere! Whatever problem you tell them, they say we will send it to the relevant department! You wait one to two whole days for them to write you a message that makes no sense! And substance! 2: after I asked them again what the problem is! They responded to me after a day again with an Email that identification is finally needed! I mean, they said that it is not necessary if the amount is greater than 500 euros. They say so themselves! 3: I start to do the identification, they asked me to take 7 photos with different poses, with the laptop behind my head, the first showing the casino, the second showing the casino and the chat open! Clean from behind! Then again the same to keep the mobiles to keep the cards they asked me for confirmation that I am the owner of the bank I had made a deposit I gave it I followed everything! I did everything as they wanted! After I'm done with these! I start Live Chat with PAUL, he said everything is fine and now you just have to wait for them to review your ID! He told me it will take 5 days!! After I waited, 5 days passed and they still haven't given me an answer! I message again and another representative answers me who had no idea what she was saying! The gentleman named Nico was telling me that they sent me an Email that a card is missing Lie! The simple excuse because I had given the card! But at first he told me that they texted me that they need some more papers! And I told him where they sent me because I don't see anything? He looked for it, I explained to him that I have sent this card! To PAUL after looking into it and seeing that I am right he told me that now you will wait for an answer from the relevant department again !! :4 first of all let's start from the beginning they did everything in their power not to give me withdrawal! They were trying to push me to play them and lose the money! But I'm not addicted, they fell for the wrong person! After seeing that nothing was happening they played their last card! They made a false accusation against me, they sent me an Email that I have other accounts! I told them I want proof? For the claim you are making against me, they still do not have an answer to my emails because they know very well that what they are saying is a lie. I put my money in and I want it all back, otherwise I will put my father who has connections with Cyprus and abroad and will sue for fraud. Are you sure it won't stay like this we will collect a lot? evidence against this company that has casinoin and something but together casino brothers. It's not the 900 euros, I got really angry with the deception they do and that they play with the psychology of the world! They think we are stupid that we don't understand what they are doing exactly I will gather other people who have the same problem here in Guru and we will make it legal procedures such casinos should be closed very soon! I'm waiting for a reply with evidence of IP and everything they say if they don't put the money, a lawsuit will be filed, we have found out who is behind the company in question! Thank you so much üôè Guru for letting us show the world it can be done! Thank you very much</p>
