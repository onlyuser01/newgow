    <h1>Tao Fortune Casino Parx Casino Shippensburg Pa Fortune Casino Online Casino In Biloxi Ms Resort Worl</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I came across this casino and was attracted by its claim to be decentralized with instant payouts, which should ideally keep my money safe...</p>
<p>On January 7, I made a couple of deposits into this casino</p>
<p>While playing without a bonus, I won a certain amount. The casino's currency is their DEGA tokens, so I can't specify the exact amount, but at that time it was $300</p>
<p>I decided to withdraw my funds, but I encountered an error</p>
<p>and I couldnâ€™t manage to withdraw my money.</p>
<p>Upon contacting support, they asked me to undergo verification (passport photo, utility bill, selfie with a passport and a sheet of paper saying "Hi, [Casino Name], [Current Date], and [Registration Email].") I registered with this casino for convenience since it advertises instant payments, it's a decentralized casino and such... but I had to send them the documents anyway.</p>
<p>I waited for a response for a very long time</p>
<p>One of their responses was:</p>
<p>"while reviewing your KYC request and the reason why you are waiting longer than usual is that, And I'm talking about one of the documents, for which we have to investigate exactly where you are coming from and it has to do with our country restrictions policy."</p>
<p>And now my account has been blocked and they are not processing the withdrawal.</p>
<p>I have been waiting for a very long time, but they are not providing me with any time frames.</p>
<p>Regarding their country restrictions policy</p>
<p>Russian Federation is not on their list of prohibited countries as per their regulations. So, I can't understand what the problem is and why I have been waiting almost a month where it is claimed that the withdrawals are instant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while entering data, the Russian Federation was listed among the countries</p>
