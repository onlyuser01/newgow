<p>Konami Gaming, Konami’s gambling supplier arm, has minted a new deal with Pariplay, one of the world’s biggest content providers and aggregators. Under the agreement, Konami Gaming will provide content to Pariplay’s renowned Pariplay Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Pariplay Will Distribute Konami Content</p>
<p>Konami is a big name when it comes to both video games and gambling content. The company has supplied operators with slot machines and gaming enterprise management systems for the last two decades and is known for its dedication to innovation and quality. Konami is also known for its attention to detail and unparalleled originality when it comes to games.</p>
<p>Per the deal with Pariplay, Konami will provide the aggregator with its online portfolio of popular land-based casino titles. The content will be integrated into Pariplay’s Fusion platform, allowing the aggregator’s partners to access a variety of Konami games. Thanks to this, gambling operators will be able to engage players with Konami’s rich selection of classic and innovative casino games.</p>
<p>The Fusion platform is a leading aggregation solution that is currently used by over 150 operators in the industry. It offers more than 14,000 games from over 80 renowned gaming suppliers. In addition, Pariplay Fusion offers a complete selection of player retention tools that allow companies to keep their customers.</p>
<p>Thanks to the agreement with Pariplay, Konami will be able to greatly expand its global footprint and launch its games with various operators across dozens of markets.</p>
<p>The Agreement will Help Konami Reach More Players</p>
<p>Konami Gaming’s president and chief executive officer, Steve Sutherland, commented on the new agreement. He praised the Pariplay Fusion platform for its expansive reach and said that the current deal would be a great way for Konami to “get its content in front of broader player audiences.”</p>
<p>Our portfolio of classic and modern titles has stood the test of time and this agreement with Pariplay will help us to continue to excel in both established and emerging markets. Steve Sutherland, CEO, Konami Gaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Callum Harris, Pariplay’s director of partnerships said that Konami Gaming rightfully deserves its reputation. He emphasized that the latter company is known to develop best-in-class titles, which is further attested by its history of success in the retail sector. Harris concluded that this success has translated well to the iGaming sector and said that Konami’s games would be a great addition to the Fusion platform.</p>
<p>It is a major boost to be able to add Konami’s games to the Fusion platform, and we are sure that they will perform very well in markets right across the world. Callum Harris, director of partnerships, Pariplay</p>
