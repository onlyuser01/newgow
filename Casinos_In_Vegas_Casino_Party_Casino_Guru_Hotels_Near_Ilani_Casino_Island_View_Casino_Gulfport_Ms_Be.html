<p>An unnamed registered punter at FanDuel Sportsbook won big on Sunday as they managed to win over half a million dollars after they wagered $20 on the exact score of the AFC and NFC title games. The outcome was so surprising that even FanDuel couldn’t believe what the NFL bettor pulled off.</p>
<p>In the Words of FanDuel’s Twitter Account – “There’s NO WAY. There’s Just NO WAY”</p>
<p>FanDuel Sportsbook, which recently became Buffalo Bills’ partner, took to social media to comment on the happening. The social media department of the sportsbook was concise: “There’s NO WAY. There’s just NO WAY. The most INSANE parlay you’ll ever see, guaranteed.”</p>
<p>The NFL bettor wagered $20 and managed to win just over $579,000 on two parlay bets. First, they wagered for the Bengals to win against the Chiefs with a 27-24 score. They also wagered on the exact score of the Rams versus the San Francisco 49ers 20-17.</p>
<p>Here’s what makes this bet such an incredible win. The Bengals managed to rally even though they were 18 down. A 31-yard goal by Evan McPherson in overtime clocked the 27-24 win against the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC and in doing so, the Bengals reached their first Super Bowl since 1988.</p>
<p>On the other side, the Los Angeles Rams star-studded team managed to help them overcome the 49ers and edge out the victory to reach the Super Bowl. Matthew Stafford made a huge impact as he led three straight fourth-quarter scoring drives to erase the 10-point lead that the 49ers had.</p>
<p>A Bet Such As This One is Mathematically Won Once in 10,000 Attempts</p>
<p>The NFL bettor’s combined odds for the parlay bet on the exact score of these two games were +2,895,000. Mathematic calculation suggests that the implied probability is 0.03%, meaning that a bet such as this one can be won once in 10,000 attempts. Bengals’ odds of winning 27-24 were +22,000, while the exact score of 20-17 in the Rams-49ers game had odds of +13,000.</p>
<p>While speaking to The Action Network, Kevin Hennessy, a FanDuel spokesman, said that it is truly amazing to witness a bettor win a ticket such as this one. Hennessy also spoke to Casino.org and said that there were two additional winners that night, and both of them wagered on the exact scores of the games. One of them won $58,000 by betting $2, and the other one wagered $5 to win $145,000.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is the most popular sports event to bet on in the US. The 2022 Super Bowl is scheduled to take place on February 14 at SoFi Stadium, and an interesting fact about it is that DraftKings will be the sole betting agency to run ads during the game after it agreed to pay $6.5 million.</p>
