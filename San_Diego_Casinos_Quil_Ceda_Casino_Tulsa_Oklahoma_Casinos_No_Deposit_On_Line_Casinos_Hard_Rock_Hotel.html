<p>The supplier of content and platform solutions for the sports betting vertical has teamed up with the pan-African operator to boost its reach and capacity</p>
<p>As a result, PremierBet will be able to continue leveraging new and advanced solutions for its sportsbook. The brand is one of the leaders in the pan-African market, with a strong presence in dozens of regulated markets across the region.</p>
<p>PremierBet and BtoBet Determined to Carry on in Africa</p>
<p>PremierBet and BtoBet have been partnering up since 2017 and now cover 23 jurisdictions in the continent. Under the terms of the latest partnership, the two companies will continue to work together with BtoBet powering PremierBet’s sportsbook in each of the operational markets.</p>
<p>PremierBet will benefit from BtoBet’s advanced solutions that lead to better and more worthwhile experiences for sports fans and bettors. Commenting on this opportunity, BtoBet managing director Dima Reiderman said that the company was particularly proud to continue and assist PremierBet on its journey in the region:</p>
<p>We are proud to have cemented this partnership extension, and that BtoBet will keep on supporting PremierBet as they further expand their presence and strengthen their position as the leading operator in Africa. BtoBet managing director Dima Reiderman</p>
<p>Reiderman further hailed the significance of BtoBet as a technological partner. The company, Reiderman, was a trusted provider of cutting-edge and flexible solutions for the betting market, and the decision to expand with PremierBet was a testament to this.</p>
<p>PremierBet spokesperson was similarly pleased to see BtoBet and the sportsbook continue their mutual journey together. The sportsbook similarly saw BtoBet as a provider of advanced and important solutions for the sector.</p>
<p>Growing in Africa and Beyond</p>
<p>“This agreement is an important building block in our long-term strategy to deliver an optimal player experience, and we are excited to continue to work closely with BtoBet to evolve the partnership,” PremierBet concluded.</p>
<p>BtoBet has been committed to building up its African presence. The company has been signing with a number of local operators, including UtopBet. BtoBet has been expanding its reach in new markets as well and successfully obtained a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Control Commission in Ontario earlier in 2023.</p>
