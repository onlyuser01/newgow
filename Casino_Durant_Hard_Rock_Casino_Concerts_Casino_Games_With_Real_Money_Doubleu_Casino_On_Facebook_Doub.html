    <h1>Casino Durant Hard Rock Casino Concerts Casino Games With Real Money Doubleu Casino On Facebook Doub</h1>

<p>Hello tiptizzie24,</p>
<p>Hello Peter,</p>
<p>I hope that you're well and safe.</p>
<p>Please note that we have reviewed your account and the issue you have encountered.</p>
<p>To start off, we see that you have deposited on the 12th of July using the bonus BIGCAT50. The terms of the promotion state that the bonus can be wagered on Non-progressive slots only and they can be seen here:</p>
<p>https://casinobrango.com/terms?class=bigcat50</p>
<p>From what we can see, you have finalized your first withdrawal request of $2,500.00 at 12:31:53 on 7/15/2023, Casino time. The second withdrawal request of $1,500.00 was finalized on 7/16/2023, and with this withdrawal, you have reached your $4,000.00 weekly withdrawal limit given that your VIP level is Silver. The details of each VIP level can be seen here.</p>
<p>https://casinobrango.com/vip-lounge</p>
<p>Given that you have submitted your third withdrawal request on the 22nd of July, in the amount of $2,500.00, you were not able to finalize it as you were still within your weekly withdrawal limits. On said day, you were able to request a total of $1,500.00. As you have decided to submit your withdrawal request for the full $4,000.00 you were required to wait until the 24th of July in order to be able to withdraw the full amount.</p>
<p>Therefore, the technical difficulties that indeed occurred during the 23rd of July, had no effect on your withdrawal status and limits.</p>
<p>Once you have submitted your following withdrawal request of $4,000.00 on the 24th of July, it was determined that you have played Progressive slots which is a violation of the Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
<p>We must also turn your attention to the fact that the Terms of the promotion remain in full effect all from the moment it was first claimed up until the the entire balance is withdrawn and a new deposit action is made.</p>

<p>7.1. General Bonus and Promotion Rules</p>
<p>w. "Once a bonus is claimed, the terms of that bonus step into effect immediately. These terms remain in full effect until a new Fund Action (Deposit or Bonus) is processed to your account and after the bonus has been cleared from your balance. Bonus Terms will remain in effect after Wagering has been met. Bonus Terms will remain in effect after a Withdrawal is processed. Bonus Terms will remain in effect after Playable Balance drops below $/â‚¬ 1. Depositing on top of your existing bonus balance does not void the Bonus Terms. Any violations of the terms while they are in effect, may result in all winnings being voided as per the Terms &amp; Conditions. The Terms of the promotion are not in effect once a new fund action (deposit or bonus) is made at the moment the playable balance is below $1.00. Refer to the term 7.1.i."</p>
<p>At the moment of your withdrawal request, it was established that you have played a 485 games on Progressive slots, wagering a total of $1,543.00 in the process.</p>
<p>Due to the violation made, the Payments team applied the term 7.1.w. thus voiding the winnings.</p>
<p>We hope the explanation provided is clear and understandable enough. Should you need any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
