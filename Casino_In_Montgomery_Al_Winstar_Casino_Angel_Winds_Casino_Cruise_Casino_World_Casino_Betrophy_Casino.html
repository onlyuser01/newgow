    <h1>Casino In Montgomery Al Winstar Casino Angel Winds Casino Cruise Casino World Casino Betrophy Casino</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is the first time submitting a complaint here so if I forgot something I apologize.</p>
<p>This issue with Bellona N.V. has been on going since June of 2022 in relation to responsible gambling not followed.</p>
<p>I opened an account with Silverplay played through money and then emailed with a self exclusion request with all my information etc. due to a gambling problem. Screenshots of correspondence with the site (Silverplay) will be attached. I emailed them stating to please contact their operater (Bellona N.V.) informing them I wanted to be blocked/blacklisted /self excluded across their system.</p>
<p>I was then able to open an account with Slotimo and through the same process as above it happened.</p>
<p>I received a response to say they have received my email and would be contacted by the relevant department in relation to the matter. I even went so far as to email asking for a direct email address to Bellona N.V. so I could contact them about the issue and received no such response.</p>
<p>They acknowledged my email for self exclusion across the operating system but failed to act and as such more and more accounts were allowed to be opened and played across their operating system.</p>
<p>I submitted a complaint with the sites and was told I do not meet the criteria for a refund, no explanation behind it.</p>
<p>I submitted a complaint through E-Moore and they more or less said that the information they received from Bellona N.V. shows I had multiple accounts using different emails (the ones in the email I requested for self exclusion) were used and I circumvented the system. I asked for E-Moore to provide this information to me as my personal information is on it and they refused to send it.</p>
<p>Please note: They have made a false statement in regards to me using multiple emails because if you have ever signed up to a site you will not be able to use that email address to sign up again. As such, the email addresses that Bellona N.V./E-Moore stated I used to circumvent the system I was able to open accounts with showing that these email addresses were never used on such sites.</p>
<p>I requested my personal information from the sites to prove that all accounts were opened with the same name, email address, DOB etc. to show that they failed on their behalf. I received only one transaction history. I received emails to state I never had an account with their site before yet I had screenshots of payments to prove they, again, were lying.</p>
<p>I am back and forth with E-Moore for nearly 4 months now and still nothing has been resolved reaching nearly 200 emails.</p>
<p>I have previously seen somewhere on this complaints that someone else had this issue before with the exact same case and it was resolved so I am here now trying to find help with this case as I firmly believe that I done everything within my power to state that I had a Gambling addiction, received a response to state they acknowledged it but failed to act and as such allowed me to open accounts with them and thousands to be deposited.</p>
<p>I have attached multiple screenshots of correspondence between the sites and also with E-Moore.</p>
<p>If you could help with this matter it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
