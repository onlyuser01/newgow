    <h1>Hotels Near Mystic Lake Casino Live Casino Hotel Casino Ignite 777 Iron Horse Casino South Point Hot</h1>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have the following problem.</p>
<p>I won € 250 on Voodoodreams. I wanted to have this paid out to me.</p>
<p>After I sent the requested documents, I was informed that the winnings could not be paid out because I paid in from a joint account. The € 20 I paid was refunded to me.</p>
<p>I and my wife have an account together with an individual disposal so that I can also prove that the account is rightfully mine. Should it still be the case that I cannot get the profit because of the joint account, then all the deposits that I have made would also not be valid, so that I would have to get all the deposits back ?!</p>
<p>My wife also has a player account at Voodoodreams with which she made deposits from the joint account, shouldn't this money be refunded?</p>
<p>We feel a little cheated, we don't see the difference between deposit and withdrawal.</p>
<p>The sum of all deposits from both player accounts is € 375.</p>
<p>No profit was paid out from this money.</p>
<p>I would be very grateful for your help.</p>
