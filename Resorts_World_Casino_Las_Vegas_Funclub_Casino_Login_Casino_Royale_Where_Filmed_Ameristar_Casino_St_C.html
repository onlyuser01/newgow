<p>Our SS Lazio vs. AS Roma prediction is that the 2023 Derby della Capitale is going to be a real barnburner</p>
<p>AS Roma is the favorite in the November 12 Serie A game, but its odds aren’t miles away from its city rival. In fact, Lazio’s odds to win the 2023 Rome Derby are +180. The draw is currently priced at +210.</p>
<p>The Lazio vs. Roma odds aren’t much of an indicator of what we can expect from this game, but one thing is certain – this is going to be one hell of a game.</p>

<p>Injury Problems Keep Pilling on for SS Lazio</p>
<p>Maurizio Sarri’s team is sitting in the middle of the 2023-24 Serie A table with a 5-1-5 record, which accounts for 16 points. That’s 12 points fewer than Inter Milan who’s at the top of the standings. Unfortunately for Lazio, there are another eight teams in between.</p>
<p>But Lazio’s plan for the 2023-24 season isn’t to win the Italian title; instead, it’s to book the ticket to the Champions League or at least the Europa League. For that, they need to break into the top 5, which shouldn’t be too difficult if they can get back onto the winning track.</p>
<p>They lost their most recent Serie A game to Bologna on the road with the final score being 1-0. They were the underdogs in that game, so the loss didn’t come as a huge shock. The reason for that was that they were without several key men in that game.</p>
<p>Ciro immobile was struggling with fitness, so he started the game from the bench. He’s fine now, but Lazio will miss Mattia Zaccagni, Adam Marusic, Luis Alberto, and Nicolo Casale in the Rome Derby.</p>
<p>These guys also missed Lazio’s Europa League game mid-week, but the Italian team still managed to grab a 1-0 win over AZ Alkmaar thanks to a goal by Immobile.</p>
<p>AS Roma Not Doing Great in Big Games</p>
<p>AS Roma has one point more than SS Lazio in the Italian Serie A, but it’s because these guys have had a relatively light fixture list. In fact, Jose Mourinho’s men have only faced two title contenders so far. And they lost each time!</p>
<p>First, AC Milan beat them at Olimpico 2-1 in September. More recently, they lost 1-0 to Inter in Milano. In fact, Mourinho’s boys have been disappointing in big games for a while now. The evidence of this is that their record in the Rome Derby is very poor.</p>
<p>They’ve won just three of the last 10 duels with Lazio, with each of those wins happening when they were the home team.</p>
<p>You’d think that it doesn’t matter who’s the host in the Rome Derby as Roma and Lazio use the same venue (Olimpico). However, the thing is that the home team gets to sell more tickets than the visiting team. That said, Lazio will be the team the home crowd will be rooting for on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lazio vs. Roma Prediction</p>
<p>In 2023, AS Roma has much better players than Lazio. But Lazio is in better shape considering that these guys have had a rough schedule so far in the 2023-24 season. They might not win the 2023 Rome Derby, but we don’t think they’re going to lose.</p>
<p>Picks: Lazio and Roma to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
