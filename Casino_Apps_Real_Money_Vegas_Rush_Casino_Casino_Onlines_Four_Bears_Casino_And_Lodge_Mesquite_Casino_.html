<p>In the past few months, Kambi Group has recorded a streak of exciting changes and new partnerships, including the September deal inked with tribal casino operator Ilani that guaranteed its entryway into the state of Washington, the acquisition of Shape Games for $78 million, and the agreement with PENN Entertainment concerning the migration of PENN’s Kambi-powered retail and online sportsbook to a PENN proprietary technology.</p>
<p>Now, the provider of sports betting technology solutions has made a new exciting announcement aimed at the Puerto Rico market. The supplier that caters to the needs of licensed Business-to-Consumer gaming operators has sealed a long-term sports betting agreement with LMG Gaming (LMGG). The latter is owned by the media company Liberman Media Group located on the island. According to the terms of the partnership, Kambi Group will supply its sportsbook to LMGG’s ApuestaPR sports betting brand.</p>
<p>ApuestaPR, Ready to Become Puerto Rico’s #1 Sports Betting Brand</p>
<p>Through a mix of state-of-the-art sportsbook technology and marketing opportunities on LMG’s Teleonce TV network, ApuestaPR plans to turn into the number one sports betting wagering brand in Puerto Rico on LMG’s Teleonce television network. ApuestaPR is determined to set itself apart from its competition using a one-of-a-kind marketing approach that reunites Kambi’s solid application programming interfaces and marketing tools with Teleonce’s celebrity endorsements and prestigious list of on-air hosts.</p>
<p>Besides its strong focus on mobile sports betting, ApuestaPR is also ready to provide Puerto Rico’s sports bettors with top–tier sportsbook solutions via a massive network made of retail outlets. Kambi’s co-founder and chief executive officer Kristian Nylén commented on the new agreement with LMG Gaming, calling it “an exciting opportunity” in the context of the company busy creating “the most engaging sports betting product” on the island. Nylén added that by harnessing Kambi’s “enhanced empowerment and marketing tools,” LMG Gaming should drive more player engagement via a customizable wagering experience.</p>
<p>“The Choice Was Clear”</p>
<p>LMG Gaming’s partner Winter Horton expressed the company’s excitement for joining hands with Kambi for their ApuestaPR sports betting business in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Horton explained that LMGG went through “extensive research” at the end of which “the choice was clear,” with Kambi in the lead for the position of “the best-in-class sportsbook in the industry” to partner with. He also expressed the company’s honor to be able to build their business in Puerto Rico along their side.</p>
<p>At the moment, Kambi Group employs over 1,100 staff members in offices spread across Australia, Denmark, Romania, the Philippines, Sweden, the US, the UK, and Malta where it also has its headquarters.</p>
