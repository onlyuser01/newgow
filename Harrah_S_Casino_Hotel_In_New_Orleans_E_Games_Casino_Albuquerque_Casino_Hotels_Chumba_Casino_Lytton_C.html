ParlayBay will gain access to new operators and their audiences whereas Hub88 will be a more appealing platform provider thanks to the increased number of games available.</p>

These promotional tools though come along with a number of excellent benefits, such as free bets, early-bird bonuses, cash drops, and other features ParlayBay is confident will resonate with sports betting crowds.</p>
