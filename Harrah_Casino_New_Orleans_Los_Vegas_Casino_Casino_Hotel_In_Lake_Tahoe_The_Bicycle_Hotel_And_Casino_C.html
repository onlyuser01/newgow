    <h1>Harrah Casino New Orleans Los Vegas Casino Casino Hotel In Lake Tahoe The Bicycle Hotel And Casino C</h1>

<p>I have been playing at BetPat for about a week. I registered through Roshtein using an affiliate link.</p>
<p>On September 12, 2021 I had some big wins and built up a balance of about $12,400 CAD.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning (September 13, 2021) and tried to log in. I was shocked to find out that BetPat closed my account. When I checked my email it said I have duplicate accounts so my account was closed. This is NOT true as I have not registered for BetPat before. They even verified my documents. There is no reason why my account should have been closed as I have followed all of the TOS. My account was only closed when I had large winnings.</p>
<p>I reached out to support via email and got the exact same generic message as a response. They have provided very little details.</p>
<p>All I want is to be treated fairly by this casino. The way they handled this is very clearly a way to scam customers.</p>
