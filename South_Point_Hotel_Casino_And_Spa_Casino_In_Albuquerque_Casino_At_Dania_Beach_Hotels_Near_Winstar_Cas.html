    <h1>South Point Hotel Casino And Spa Casino In Albuquerque Casino At Dania Beach Hotels Near Winstar Cas</h1>

<p>Pariplay, a NeoGames S.A. has struck a new partnership, this time with Playgon, a developer of innovative games, which will be joining the company’s Fusion platform. The partnership is important to Pariplay as it enables it to continue growing its aggregation platform and content while also granting Playgon the infrastructure necessary for the studio to reach new audiences and drive better conversions for partners.</p>
<p>Playgon is operating specifically in the Canadian iGaming market and focuses on live dealer casino games streamed from Las Vegas. Playgon features a number of cutting-edge features that the company believes allow it to innovate the industry while staying ahead of the pack. It deploys progressive web application (PWA) technology to create compelling and riveting experiences in several game categories, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat.</p>
<p>Playgon takes its offer a step further, though, by adding eTable games, for example, and putting an emphasis on developing experiences that make its products distinguishable in the long run. The eTable segment comes with the option to participate in single or multiplayer experiences, including a VIP experience that is personalized to match any preference and taste.</p>
<p>Pariplay Director of Partnerships has welcomed the addition of this new studio to the Fusion platform. Callum Harris had this to add:</p>
<p>Playgon has successfully developed a unique live dealer product with well-designed gameplay features that use cutting-edge technology to deliver a unique playing experience that particularly appeals to a different demographic.</p>
<p>Playgon CEO and President Darcy Krogh were equally pleased with the partnership opportunity, speaking about the long-term implications and what it means for the company. This integration with the Fusion platform makes it simpler to reach new audiences, Krogh explained. It’s beyond any reasonable doubt, she continued, that this integration would help accelerate the company’s ambitious growth strategy.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been very busy of late, making sure to continue with its global push. The company hired Doina Stefanescu as its VP of Delivery in August and it further expanded in Latin America through a successful license application in Buenos Aires City. North America has generally been an important part of the company’s long-term strategy as well.</p>
<p>The company confirmed in August that it’s also launching in Pennsylvania and made its ambitions for New Jersey known as early as May this year. The Fusion platform today is a powerful tool that helps operators find the exact gaming solutions their audiences need and want.</p>
