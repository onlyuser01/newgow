<p>Star Entertainment Group Increases Parental Leave Time</p>
<p>Star Entertainment Group has announced the implementation of a new parental leave policy. The company will increase parental leave for new parents. According to the company, this is an efficient, flexible, and family-friendly decision. The goal is to ensure for the staff a diverse and inclusive working environment. Parental leave would be available for up to two years after the birth or adoption of a child.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, new parents will receive increased parental paid leave from 10 to 16 weeks for principal carers. Secondary carers will see an increase of 4 weeks, and superannuation on all company-paid parental leave will increase with 2 more weeks for secondary carers.</p>
<p>Staff members who welcome a new member to the family would get 18 weeks total. Waiting periods on continuous service eligibility for all staff members who work for the company long-term will be removed.</p>
<p>Women in the Gaming Industry Applaud the New Policy</p>
<p>The company collaborated with Women at The Star, which is a working group formed by the staff members, aiming to promote gender equality.</p>
<p>Star Entertainment CEO and managing director Matt Bekier said that the company understands that family situations are different for each staff member.</p>
<p>He said that the team aimed to ensure that all parents receive support and feel safe to welcome their new family members. Bekier stated that the company’s new parental leave policy reflects the needs of staff members. It will ensure that they have the opportunity to grow personally and professionally.</p>
<p>Women in Gaming &amp; Hospitality Australasia CEO Helen Galloway said that Inclusive policies would help organizations attract and keep talented employees. She stated that The Star deserves applause on the new meaningful policy, which aims to provide equality in the working environment.”</p>
