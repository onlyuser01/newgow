<p>Louisiana Casino Developer Attacks Opposition in Slidell, Calls it ‘Unfounded’</p>

<p>Peninsula Pacific Entertainment (P2E) permanently closed its DiamondJacks Casino last year. The company blamed the pandemic for its decision not to reopen the Bossier City casino.</p>
<p>P2E is amid an expensive mission to transfer its casino license to Slidell. The company has proposed building a $325 million gaming property and hotel on Lake Pontchartrain’s Lakeshore Marina.</p>
<p>On November 13, parish voters will decide if they approve of allowing a casino to be built near The Blind Tiger restaurant. If a simple majority backs the ballot question, P2E will clear its largest obstacle in relocating to southern Louisiana.</p>
<p>Opposition Arising</p>
<p>Not everyone is in favor of allowing Peninsula Pacific to move.</p>
<p>Dr. Jason Goltz and his wife Chandler reside near the Lakeshore Marina. This summer, the couple launched a petition on Change.org and collected more than 1,440 signatures opposing the St. Tammany casino.</p>
<p>Following the support, Dr. Goltz, an orthodontist in town, filed a petition with the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, He argued that the state would be committing an illegal and unconstitutional act if it allows P2E’s casino license to be transferred to a new area. Dr. Goltz and his wife have since brought legal action in the 19th Judicial District Court seeking a judge to block the casino election vote.</p>
<p>The Goltz complaint says referendums regarding the authorization of casino gambling must apply parish-wide. The ballot question set to go before St. Tammany voters asks if they wish to legalize gambling in a single location — on vacant land near Interstate 10 on the marina. The casino’s targeted site is less than 1,000 yards from where the Goltz family resides.</p>
<p>Two other similar lawsuits have been filed seeking to interject in the casino progression.</p>
<p>Casino Defends Project</p>
<p>Representatives from P2E say the lawsuits oppose 1,700 construction jobs that the resort would create, and 1,000 permanent full-time operational positions. The casino operator claims the litigation arose because there’s widespread support for the project, and the minority opposition is trying to interfere with what’s likely a November vote to move the gaming development forward.</p>
<p>That’s why opponents are pushing unfounded lawsuits and deception to stop their neighbors from voting on this economic development opportunity,” said P2E spokesperson Jason Harbison.</p>
<p>Along with sharing gross gaming revenue by way of taxes with Slidell and the parish, estimated to be between $7.5 million to $9 million annually, P2E says with a successful referendum it will donate $5 million towards the Slidell ring levee. The company would additionally invest $30 million to build a sports and entertainment complex on the marina.</p>
