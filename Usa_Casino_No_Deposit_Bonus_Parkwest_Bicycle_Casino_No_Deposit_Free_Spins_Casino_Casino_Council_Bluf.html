<p>The UK gambling regulator, the Gambling Commission, announced a new important appointment. Earlier this week, the regulator confirmed it selected Nick Rust for the role of Chair of its Industry Forum. Assuming the role this month, he will hold it for a two-year term.</p>
<p>Announced back in September, the Industry Forum seeks to provide the Commission with insights and the views of the gambling operators. Representatives of the gambling sector, including stakeholders, will engage in different initiatives with advisory groups with a goal to ensure that the work of the Industry Forum is evidence-led.</p>
<p>Currently, Rust holds the role of Chair of the Starting Price Regulatory Commission. He is also a Non-Executive Director of Redcar Racecourse and a founding partner of the company that specializes in equine sports, GVS EQ. Other important roles that Rust holds include a trustee of the Injured Jockeys Fund. Throughout his extensive career, he held different senior-level roles within the gambling and sports sectors.</p>
<p>For six years, Rust successfully led the British Horseracing Authority, the regulatory authority responsible for horse racing in Great Britain. While a part of the Authority, he held the important role of CEO.</p>
<p>Marcus Boyle, the Gambling Commission's Chair, commented on the recent appointment. In a statement, he explained: "I am delighted that Nick has been appointed as the inaugural Chair of the Commission's Industry Forum." Finally, Boyle said: "Nick's extensive knowledge of the gambling sector makes him a valuable asset, and I am confident he will work with us to create a productive and insightful Industry Forum."</p>
<p>Upon announcing details regarding the new gambling Industry Forum back in September, Boyle also shared his excitement. At the time, he explained: "Weâ€™ve always listened to the views of the industry when deciding how best to make progress but this new forum will give us another way to work with representatives from the industry we regulate."</p>
<p>The announcement of the Gambling Commission comes after it recently confirmed it hired seven commissioners. Announced late last month, the gambling watchdog confirmed it hired Sheree Howard, Helen Dodds, Charles Counsell and Claudia Mortimore who will serve a five-year term. On the other hand, the Commission also selected Lloydette Bai-Marrow, Helen Philips and David Rossington as commissioners who will serve four-year terms. According to the Commission, the appointments have been in effect as of September 11, 2023.</p>
