    <h1>Silverton Casino Hotel Las Vegas Stratosphere Hotel Casino Play Casino Games Four Winds Casino New B</h1>

<p>On 04.07.2020 I sent withdraw request on 2.000 eur to bookmaker BABIBET.com.</p>
<p>On 09.07.2020 when I logged in to my account with BABIBET I saw that 5,547 eur had mysteriously disappeared from my account.I was even more astonished when I saw in my betting history that on the previous day 08.07.2020 ''someone'' played on my account and on several occasions lost my 5.547 eur on live betting.Also my withdraw request of 2.000 eur was canceled.</p>
<p>I called them right away on the live chat and when asked what happened to my 5.547 eur. because on that day 08.07.2020 I was not logged into my account with BABIBET, and I did not have any activities that day, so I did not cancel my withdraw request and I did not even play in sports betting.</p>
<p>I got a very strange answer:</p>
<p>Mariana L.: The cancelation is done directly from your account.</p>
<p>Mariana L.: Should you have any concern that access to your account has been compromised, we would like to suggest that you change your login credentials with immediate effect and to use a more robust password to prevent any breach occurring in the future.</p>
<p>Mariana L.: If you don't remember to have canceled your request, the only other possible option is that is was done by someone who knows your username and password.</p>
<p>ME : Can you inform me Who made that bets on 08.07.2020 and spend my 5.547.40 euro??</p>
<p>Mariana L.: Only he has your password can operate in your account.</p>
<p>ME : WHO is that ;; ONLY he has password can operate in your account.::</p>
<p>ME: Who has my password and can operate in my account??</p>
<p>ME: What are you talking about??</p>
<p>Mariana L.: I've already answered this question. Please don't insist on further.</p>
<p>I even received a recommendation for treatment for gambling addictions ?? !! ??</p>
<p>www.gamblingtherapy.org www.gamblersanonymous.org www.gamcare.org.uk</p>
<p>I sent many emails to BABIBET, as well as to their sports and technical provider, to send me the original document from the logged IP address to my account on 08.07.2020 to see if someone was logged in or not to my account with BABIBET, to find out who did this financial damage (of course in favor of BABIBET) because that day I was not logged into my account with BABIBET.</p>
<p>To date, I have not received a response from them or their provider.???</p>
<p>I believe that BABIBET made a scandalous scam by canceling my withdraw request and immediately then set up several lost fake bets in live in my betting history and thus dishonorably took my money in the amount of 5.547 eur.</p>
<p>Attached to my suspicion are dozens of player complaints against the BABIBET bookmaker that I met on various sites and bookmaker reviews, where they were financially damaged in literally the same way:</p>
<p>First, the withdraw request was cancelled , and then false losing bets were placed on their account, and in that way, their money easily passed to BABIBET.?!?</p>
<p>A complaint to their licensor was sent, so let me see how it will respond to this kind of fraud, because it is more than clear that this is not their first time to do this ?</p>
<p>Is this some new scandalous trend of money theft by bookmakers ????</p>
