<p>ORYX Gaming, a leading B2B provider of gambling offerings and turnkey solutions, has inked an expansion of its partnership with the online casino 888casino. The refreshed deal will see the former company launch its leading iGaming content in Spain through 888casino.</p>
<p>ORYX to Provide 888casino with a Myriad of Games</p>
<p>The two parties proceeded with the deal quickly and several of ORYX Gaming’s proprietary games are already available to Spanish customers. According to the agreement, more titles will be launched in the future, helping the provider establish a firmer foothold in the country.</p>
<p>Bettors in Spain can now play several of ORYX’s games, as well as games by Atomic Slot Lab, a subsidiary of ORYX’s parent company, Bragg Gaming Group. Additionally, the deal will see Braggs launch several games by Blue Guru, one of its newest partners.</p>
<p>Thanks to the agreement, 888casino’s Spanish visitors can now enjoy a large variety of great localized gambling content. The titles provided by ORYX Gaming boast a unique atmosphere and cover a variety of themes to choose from. Furthermore, the games feature exciting mechanics that will always keep bettors on the edge of their sears.</p>
<p>Spain is a crucial region for ORYX Gaming’s expansion strategy. The company already has deals with several operators in the country and is looking to establish itself as one of the powerhouses when it comes to providing games for Spanish punters.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Are Delighted to Continue Working Together</p>
<p>888casino’s vice president of marketing and head of casino, Talya Benyamini, is glad to see her company expand its relationship with ORYX Gaming. She is excited to provide casino visitors with “an increased portfolio of dynamic and exciting titles” which is exactly ORYX’s specialty.</p>
<p>ORYX Gaming and 888casino have a long-lasting relationship and are working together across numerous regulated markets. Recently, the latter company added ORYX games in its offerings for Sweden and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Chris Looney, Braggs Gaming Group’s chief commercial officer, is delighted to expand this relationship even more. He said that he is glad to be able to collaborate with 888 in so many markets and is looking forward to engaging Spanish users of 888casino with ORYX’s suite of titles. Looney added:</p>
<p>“Extending our successful collaboration to Spain is a great next step as we continue to execute our growth strategy across key regulated markets together with trusted and leading partners.” Braggs Gaming Group CCO Chris Looney</p>
<p>ORYX Gaming has been steadily expanding its footprint in the last few months. Around the end of 2021, the company signed deals with White Hat Gaming and Jack’s Casino Alliance, thus increasing its presence in Europe and beyond.</p>
