<p>The re-regulated Swedish gambling market, which will give further powers to the regulator, Spelinspektionen, is almost upon the country. As the deadline closes in with the new laws set to kick off on July 1, suppliers continue to pursue licensing.</p>
<p>Two new entities have obtained their B2B supplier licenses over the past few days, including MGA Games and Air Dice. Both companies have hailed this milestone and said that it played a significant role in their expansion in Europe, but also in their commitment to providing Swedish players with trusted gambling products that are only used by regulated and authorized operators.</p>
<p>Air Dice Group has welcomed the opportunity to be granted this licensure and permission. Air Dice Partner &amp; CBDO Erkki Nikunen said that the company was excited to have extended its presence in the regulated market and make it so that its products are readily available with licensed partner operators.</p>
<p>"Our business continues to expand across multiple regulated jurisdictions and the Swedish license is a testament to the hard work and exemplary standards of our whole team, technology and focus as a company," Nikunen said. Among the games that will be released on the market are many select titles, such as Wandering Devourer and Neon Shifter.</p>
<p>More titles though are promised in the pipeline with Air Dice Group confident that it will replicate its success in Europe so far in Sweden as well. Meanwhile, MGA Games has also been granted permission to carry on in the market.</p>
<p>MGA Games offers a bulkier selection of games as well, with the company featuring some 100 games, among which Circus Mystery, Ice Queen, Captain Nemo, and Jade Goddess, to name a few. The supplier was similarly thankful for the opportunity to strengthen its presence in the regulated market and remain an important part of its landscape.</p>
<p>Sweden has passed comprehensive changes to its gambling laws that will now see the gambling regulator go after suppliers that may be offering their products to unlicensed operators. Those unlicensed operators have been known in the past to target Swedish players, using their game portfolio as an argument to attract consumers.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Spelinspektionen will go after any brand that may have such arrangements in place, which makes it doubly important for licensed suppliers to ensure that their products are only available at licensed operators.</p>
