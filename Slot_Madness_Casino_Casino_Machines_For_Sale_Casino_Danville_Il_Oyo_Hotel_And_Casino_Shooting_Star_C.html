    <h1>Slot Madness Casino Casino Machines For Sale Casino Danville Il Oyo Hotel And Casino Shooting Star C</h1>

<p>They will deliberately delay the verification procedure, they will constantly demand more and more new documents, you can look at the complaints of other players - it's the same everywhere, everyone is tightening verification.</p>
<p>But most likely you will get your payout. I advise you not to waste time and immediately contact MADRE, since you are apparently from an EU country, you will be quickly paid out and after that I suggest you forget about this casino like a nightmare ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>My situation is much worse. I was harassed for a month and a half with additional verification checks. As a result, they found the most ridiculous reason not to pay the winnings of 400 euros. They said that they would return the deposits (150 euros), but spoiler: they did not return, I put 150 euros on the withdrawal, but they cancel the withdrawal. And they just ignore my chat and email messages.</p>
<p>Naturally, I filed a complaint with MADRA and received the following response:</p>
<p>"MADRE has found the claim admissible under Section 2.a of the Rules of Procedure. There it is stated that "These procedures shall apply for the out-of-court resolution of domestic and cross-border disputes concerning contractual obligations resulting from gambling contracts between Operators licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority and Consumers resident in the European Union through the intervention of MADRE which proposes an amicable solution (â€¦) Disputes raised by Claimants from outside the EU are admissible only if the Operator consents to submit to the proceedings. "</p>
<p>The operator stated regarding your claim: "Please note that the complaint is from Belarus and as per section 2.a) of MADRE Rules of Procedure, operators are not required to respond to cases from outside the EU."</p>
<p>Sadly, we need to inform you that we cannot handle your case.</p>
<p>We wish you all the best."</p>
<p>I have always thought that the Maltese license is one of the best licenses compared to curacao licenses, but apparently the Maltese license is one of the best only for people from the European Union, players from the rest of the world playing with a Maltese license = playing without a license at all. This is very sad for me :(</p>
