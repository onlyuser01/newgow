    <h1>Harrah S Hoosier Park Racing Casino Cosmo Casino Online Casino Free Bonus No Deposit Thunder Valley</h1>

<p>Hello Nick, I reached out to slot Gardens chat inquiring about my withdrawal request I made over 20 days ago via Bitcoin they escalated it and told me to reach back out in 24 hours so I did and I was told they denied it because I did not deposit with Bitcoin so they could not payout via Bitcoin. I then asked them why they could not do an ACH transfer or send a check being they've denied both banks that I provided the correct info for their answer was their experiencing extreme delays with ACH and check withdrawal requests therefore they will not be processing withdrawals that way until further notice. I then asked if I could have a list of the banks that they do accept being I've already been through two and in order to open another account I then have to wait another 30 days for that bank to send a statement which could and most likely be denied as well and I was told that they do not have access to that information. I also asked if I made a small deposit using Bitcoin could I then request a Bitcoin withdrawal and I was told no because that is not the method I used to deposit the money that I won with. I was able to screenshot most of the conversation if needed. I looked in my account and the $4,500 is not in there I also asked the agent how I was supposed to request another withdrawal when the money was not in my account and she said when I get new banking information then to email it to payments at slot Gardens.com. I am just at a loss at this point I've already opened up two other bank accounts which they've denied how many more bank accounts do i need to open before they approve one? Not to mention the additional 30 days I have to wait to get a bank statement. When you go to the withdrawal process and pick bank wire nowhere does it say you have to have a bank statement they don't tell you that until you provide them the banking information. Being they say they do not have a list of banks I have a feeling no matter what bank I send them they're just going to keep denying it until I just give up. Please advise thank you for your time</p>
