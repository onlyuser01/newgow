<p>The Battle of Malta for 2020 will take place online with the help of GGPoker with a $3 million Main Event inviting players to participate for as little as $550.</p>
<p>GGPoker to Host Battle of Malta 2020 with $3M GTD Main Event</p>
<p>GGPoker will hold the Battle of Malta, a landmark poker event, featuring a $3 million Main Event for the 2020 edition. The company has decided to stick with its successful online model.</p>
<p>GGPoker is now an official World of Series Poker (WSOP) partner, and has already brought to life some 54 WSOP events, and has helped the pivotal poker event adapt to the abrupt changes 2020 brought.</p>
<p>The 2020 World Series of Poker Online Series has been deemed a significant success even by the most skeptical observers, although admittedly many people couldn‚Äôt participate. With a great track record under its belt, GGPoker is hosting the Battle of Malta on November 1 through November 22.</p>

<p>The buy-in into the main event is $550 and the event itself brings $3 million in GTD, and the entire event is focused on low-to-mid stake players. Originally, the event was supposed to take place in October, but pandemic restrictions made it difficult to organize the event on time or make an adequate shift to an online format.</p>
<p>Interest in Battle of Malta Tipped to Grow</p>
<p>In 2019, the event saw interest amounting to 4,657 entries and a guaranteed prize pool worth $2.56 million. This year, the prize pool has grown. Commenting on these events, Director of Live Events and Sponsorships at GGPoker, John Scanlon, communicated the company‚Äôs elation to be able to provide players with an original edition of the Battle of Malta 20202.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honor to be unveiled as the organizers‚Äô preferred online partner, and I‚Äôm confident that this year‚Äôs Battle of Malta will be bigger and better than ever!‚Äù</p>
<p>Slawomir ≈öwitalski, the Country Manager for Casino Malta by Olympic Casino was equally excited at the opportunity to see the event happen, even though the format has changed.</p>
<p>≈öwitalski said that the team was disappointed to postpone the original event in October, but it had all turned out for the better with GGPoker now onboard and the Battle of Malta taking place despite all.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is with a heavy heart that Casino Malta had to postpone the much-awaited Battle of Malta live event, but we‚Äôre elated to partner with such a prestigious brand as GGPoker. We look forward to seeing everyone in Malta in 2021 for a very special Battle of Malta.‚Äù</p>
<p>GGPoker has decided to stay true to its schedule and push on with the event. Thanks to the availability of so many online poker events over the past months, the company found a way to bring the same level of thrill and excitement to the Battle of Malta even if the event is held remotely.</p>
<p>Having GGPoker‚Äôs Battle of Malta happen in an online format has its upsides, including a better-guaranteed prize pool, and possibly other perks such as the available bonuses at GGPoker‚Äôs European platform.</p>
<p>GGPoker is also an example of integrity as the platform has a zero-tolerance policy towards cheaters.</p>
