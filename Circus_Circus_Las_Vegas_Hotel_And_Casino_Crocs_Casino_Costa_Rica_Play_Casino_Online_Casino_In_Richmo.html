<p>The leading technology solutions and software provider, powering gambling operators around the globe, Everi Holdings Inc., announced a new partnership with the American professional soccer club from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Club Internacional de FÃºtbol Miami, also known as Inter Miami CF. Earlier this week, the company revealed that its leading mobile technology and advanced e-commerce platform for the entertainment, hospitality and sports vertical, Venuetize, will power the club's fan engagement mobile strategy.</p>
<p>Thanks to Everi's Venuetize platform, the club's supporters will be able to access engaging experiences. A statement released by the company reveals that Inter Miami CF selected Venuetize because of its mobile-facing approach and capabilities that enable fast updates for fans of the team with scores, news and additional information. At the same time, the solution provides options for exclusive merchandise, among other engaging benefits.</p>
<p>Darren Simmons, Everi's Executive Vice President and FinTech Business Leader, shared his excitement about the latest collaboration with the famous soccer club. "As the foundation for Inter Miami's supporter engagement mobile strategy, Everi's Venuetize platform is flexible enough to reach club supporters wherever they're at, with best-in-class marketing support," he said.</p>
<p>Finally, Simmons explained: "Our collective goal is to deliver a unique matchday experience that engages supporters at greater levels, all while giving them a platform to directly interact with the numerous offerings from the club."</p>
<p>The new collaboration will enable Inter Miami fans to access live updates such as scores and news. Thanks to the partnership, fans of the soccer team would be able to receive details regarding upcoming fixtures, buy tickets or receive details regarding transportation.</p>
<p>Additionally, fans of the team will be able to benefit from Inter Miami's unique mobile store. All of those capabilities are available via the club's mobile app which also offers a brand new UI. Ultimately, the app now provides a one-stop-shop option for fans that want to tap into engaging experiences and at the same time support their favorite team.</p>
<p>Details regarding the new collaboration come after Everi was recognized with an important award only recently. Early in May, the company confirmed it was honored with a 2023 Nevada Top Workplaces award. This marked the third consecutive such award for the company, recognizing its dedication to its employees.</p>
<p>Before that, in April, Everi reaffirmed its plans to secure assets from the privately-owned provider of integrated electronic bingo gaming tables, and other gambling products, Video King.</p>
