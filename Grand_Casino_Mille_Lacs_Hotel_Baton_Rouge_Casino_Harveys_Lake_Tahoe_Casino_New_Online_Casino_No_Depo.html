    <h1>Grand Casino Mille Lacs Hotel Baton Rouge Casino Harveys Lake Tahoe Casino New Online Casino No Depo</h1>

<p>I am writing to complain about this casino you are promoting. I find them deceptive as I registered on the 7th of last week to earn spins through registration, where the promotion was still in progress, yet I did not receive these promised spins. When I talked about this situation in the chat, they told me that there was a bug in the system and the spins would be added soon, and reassured me that the promotion was still active. However, today I received an email telling me that the promotion had ended. This is false advertising and I feel cheated. It's irrelevant if the promotion ended today; I had registered for it days ago. In conclusion, I would like to receive my spins.</p>
<p>As you can see in the attached photo, I asked if the spins would be added after the bug was fixed and they confirmed yes.</p>
