<p>Dota 2 The International 10 will finally take place after many setbacks along the way. The event, which was supposed to arrive in 2020, had to be deferred and, after a last-minute shift from Stockholm, to Bucharest, Dota 2’s biggest tournament may finally start in earnest.</p>
<p>With the eye-watering $40 million on the line, this tournament carries the largest prize purse to date. The previous edition was TI9 which featured $34 million. However, there is another twist to look forward to here as Team OG is returning to defend its title won in 2019.</p>
<p>OG made history by winning The International back-to-back in 2018 and 2019 and became the highest-earning esports team of all time. However, the odds put them at +1100 especially now when their offlaner, Sébastien “Ceb” Debs, had to undergo an emergency eye surgery and is recovering in France.</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain Coming in Strong in TI10</p>
<p>After a highly competitive Dota Pro Circuit, Paris Saint-Germain managed to place second behind Evil Geniuses with 1300 and 1700 DPC points respectively. Yet, they are priced as the favorites to win in the upcoming TI10 which will get underway on Thursday, October 7.</p>
<p>They are one of the few Chinese teams that have been able to avoid COVID-19 restrictions as fellow Invictus Gaming and Team Aster tested positive and had to withdraw from the competition. They might return, though, but as things stand they will most likely miss the event.</p>
<p>Even though PSG.LGD didn’t amass the most points during the DPC, they have been successful over a number of teams. They dominated the WePlay AniMajor, pulling ahead of Team Nigma and overcoming Evil Geniuses in a seamless 3-0 final.</p>
<p>Their standing at home is phenomenal and overall, PSG.LGD has been the most successful team this season, even though their showing in Major Events wasn’t always there. It’s safe to say that PSG.LGD is a justified favorite, although they won’t have it easy – not by a long shot.</p>
<p>OG’s Legacy Means a Lot to Team</p>
<p>While OG has undergone some profound changes here we are at the sidelines HOPING that the team can bring in another Aegies of Immortal home. This would be a phenomenal achievement for the franchise and one that nobody is bound to repeat any time soon. Yet, OG is posted at (+1100) for a good reason.</p>
<p>The original squad that won the 2018 and 2019 events has left the organization more or less and with Ceb now down, the team is definitely not going to have it easy. The team has also not made many dents in the overall DPC season and especially at major events where OG didn’t participate.</p>
<p>Normally, we would argue that they are darkhorse but with little information to go on and the fact that Ceb is absent (albeit he may return) we cannot realistically justify backing them up. Still, (+1100) is a good value if you want to have a long-shot bet on the side.</p>
<p>Evil Geniuses, Liquid and Nigma</p>
<p>If there are three teams that are going to be locked neck-and-neck, those are Evil Geniuses, Team Liquid and Team Nigma. Out of these, Liquid and EG have made the finals and won at least one. Liquid actually contested OG in 2019 in the grand finals but was ultimately defeated.</p>
<p>Evil Geniuses have been able to amass the biggest number of points which shouldn’t exactly surprise anyone. The team has been consistent in delivery and execution and they have played near-perfect games notwithstanding a few slips against PSG.LGD.</p>
<p>However, the North American powerhouse has had time to prepare and we feel inclined to back them up against PSG.LGD in the upcoming clash. Do you need an outright winner for the upcoming Dota 2 TI10? We say pick Evil Geniuses over PSG.</p>
