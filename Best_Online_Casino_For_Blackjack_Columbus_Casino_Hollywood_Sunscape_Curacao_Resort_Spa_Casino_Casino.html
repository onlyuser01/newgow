<p>A Straightforward Decision</p>
<p>In a statement, Amy Huchthausen, commissioner of the America East Conference said that with the expanding of the U.S. regulated sports betting market, the organization understands the risks which may come. Such risks may influence the well-being of student-athletes as well as the integrity of competitions which is why the Conference wanted to work with the experts from Sportradar.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Huchthausen acknowledged that Sportradar is a leader in the field of integrity services in the U.S. and globally. In conclusion, she added that the decision to trust and collaborate with Sportradar was straightforward for the America East Conference.</p>

Currently, the organization sponsors 18 sports including soccer, lacrosse, basketball, baseball, swimming, field hockey, and more.</p>
