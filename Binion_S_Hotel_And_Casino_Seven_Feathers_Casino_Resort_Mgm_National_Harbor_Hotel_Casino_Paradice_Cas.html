<p>Light &amp; Wonder has stormed Global Gaming Expo (G2E) with the announcement of a branded game under the Squid Game franchise. The Squid Game slot machine was introduced at the company’s booth at the gathering and as part of the newly-revealed Horizon cabinet.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder, which has been looking to continuously innovate its presence in both the land-based and digital sectors, has welcomed the opportunities to captivate audiences once again with its original take on Netflix’s all-time popular series.</p>
<p>The company has gone beyond simple IP or visual asset use and has ensured that Squid Game slot machine comes with a range of in-game rounds that have been inspired by the show’s gritty realism. Tug of War, The Glass Tile, Green Light, and Red Light are all part of the experience.</p>
<p>As to Horizon’s technical specifications, is a step up from the Jumbo cabinet, and it comes with 600,000 individual micro-LED pixels, 90-inches of display area and a 75-inch screen, iDeck, 27-inch touch screen, mobile charger, and a seamless onboarding and gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder CEO Matt Wilson welcomed the opportunity to welcome a new and exciting game to the company’s acclaimed portfolio, and particularly a title that is inspired by one of the most iconic TV phenomena.</p>
<p>"Light &amp; Wonder is proud to be the first slots gaming company in the industry to partner with Netflix’s Squid Game and bring this ground-breaking show to life across multiple casino gaming platforms," Wilson said.</p>
<p>He welcomed the opportunity to take a fan-favorite show and meld it with Light &amp; Wonder’s own gamification features and talent for building robust experiences. Squid Game is not a title ascribed to a particular medium either, as Light &amp; Wonder is confident that the excellent execution of the new game will allow it to win minds and hearts at both casino gaming floors and online.</p>
<p>This new title will further benefit from the improved and streamlined experience that the Horizon cabinet provides, Wilson added. As to the actual release of the game, Light &amp; Wonder so far intends to launch the TV-series inspired game at some point in 2024, starting with casino floors first.</p>
