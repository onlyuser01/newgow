<p>Scientific Games has become the new primary supplier of instant games for Loto-Québec. The companies have negotiated and agreed to a new five-year contract that will expand the number of scratch games available to players through Loto-Québec. This coincides with Scientific Games’ recent investment in Québec designed to expand the company’s production capabilities and ensure that it can provide a wider range of experiences to players.</p>
<p>Five Decades of Successful Partnership</p>
<p>Scientific Games has been working with Loto-Québec for more than 50 years and has been a trusted and loyal local employer, hiring and training talent locally. Thanks to Scientific Games’ World Lottery Association certification as a Responsible Gaming Supplier, Loto-Québec consumers have had a chance to experience some of the best lottery options over the past decades.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by Loto-Québec COO of lotteries and executive VP Isabelle Jean who said that Scientific Games’ help will be instrumental in building new and exciting games to keep players entertained. The company is also going to be instrumental in designing greener scratch cards to ensure that Loto-Québec minimizes its environmental footprint.</p>
<p>Scientific Games president, Americas &amp; global instant products Joh Schulz also spoke highly of the partnership and what the deal means for the company, as well as for their new partner.</p>
<p>World’s Biggest Instant Games Maker</p>
<p>Schulz was pleased that the firm’s investment in the Montreal facility is set to pay off by employing it to develop and deliver even more games to Loto-Québec.</p>
