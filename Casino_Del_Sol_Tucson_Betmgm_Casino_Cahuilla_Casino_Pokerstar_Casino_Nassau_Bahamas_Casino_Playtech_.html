<p>Playtech Outlines a Thriving Business in 2022</p>
<p>Playtech offered a trading update in which it broke down its most recent achievements and the recent for immediate optimism, citing that the September interim results have remained steady and justified in the months that followed.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA for the full year is now expected to hit €400 million, up 26% from 2021’s €317.1 million. The company enjoyed multiple successes in the Latin American region, driven by Snaitech.</p>
<p>In fact, the company was happy to report that the performance over the past year was more than enough to make up for the downturn experienced during the pandemic, which significantly suppressed results for the company.

<p>The focus of the event will be on the most exciting growth areas within the B2B division, with presentations from the management team covering the Americas and Live segments.</p>
<p>Regardless, Playtech’s business-to-business segment notched up a 17% growth from a year earlier, with the Latin American region truly driving the bulk of these operational results. The B2B sports betting and Snaitech retail subsidiary pulled off excellent performance, boosting results by 182% to €446 million in the first semester and notching up an adjusted EBITDA increase of 154% to €131.7 million.</p>
<p>Shedding Assets and Acquiring Strong Positions in the US</p>
<p>The company has definitely enjoyed successes during the year. The company’s biggest shareholder, Gopher Investments, completed the acquisition of financial services company Finalto for a sum total of Finalto. Playtech itself made some adjustments to its business structure, having shed its Casual and Social Gaming for $250 million in a bid to restructure and refocus its business more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Playtech is also not ignoring the huge opportunity that the US market presents to it, with the company expanding with live studio operations in Michigan and New Jersey, two of the biggest iGaming states by revenue as of right now.</p>
