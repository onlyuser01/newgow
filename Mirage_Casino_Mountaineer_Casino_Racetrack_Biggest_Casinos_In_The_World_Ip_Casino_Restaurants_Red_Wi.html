<p>The research has been extended and will continue until June 30, 2024</p>
<p>In a bid to unravel the intricacies of the evolving gambling landscape among young adults in Springfield, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) has greenlit additional funding for an ongoing study.</p>
<p>Gaming Commission Commits Additional Funds to Springfield’s Youth Gambling Study</p>
<p>The study, focused on individuals aged 18 to 24, is a collaborative effort between the Springfield Department of Health and Human Services, the New North Citizens’ Council, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences.</p>
<p>The newly allocated funds, totaling $34,772 from the commission’s Community Mitigation Fund, come as an extension to the initial $20,000 grant earlier this year. The decision was made during a recent Gaming Commission meeting, where Joe Delaney, chief of community affairs, highlighted the city’s commitment to sustaining the study through the end of June 2024, reported MassLive.</p>
<p>A diverse group of 10 young adults, convened regularly at the New North Council, has been delving into the gambling habits of their peers. With discussions intensified by the recent legalization of mobile and in-person sports betting, the group aims to shed light on the impacts of these changes.</p>
<p>Despite having met only six times so far, preliminary findings from the focus group are already showing promise, according to Delaney.</p>
<p>While formal results are pending, the commission commended the initiative, with Commissioner Bradford R. Hill expressing strong support for the program.</p>
<p>Hill emphasized the importance of the program highlighting the distinct nature of sports-betting consumers compared to traditional casino or lottery players.</p>
<p>According to a previous UMass report, “Social and Economic Impacts of Gambling in Massachusetts,” sports bettors are typically male, under the age of 45, and highly educated.</p>
<p>Commission Meeting Reviews Safety Measures at MGM Springfield</p>
<p>Aside from the study, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission also received updates on modifications to safety measures at MGM Springfield. Specifically, changes were made to railings aimed at preventing underage access to the gaming floor. MGM had initially installed the railings to address concerns regarding minors in a resort that boasts family attractions like a skating rink, cinemas, and restaurants.</p>
<p>However, the casino inadvertently hindered access to the GameSense office, where patrons can seek information on responsible gambling or assistance if they believe they have a gambling problem. In response, MGM promptly rectified the situation by adjusting the handrail.</p>
<p>Additionally, in November concerns were raised by Massachusetts Gaming Commission Chair Catherine Judd-Stein over the low utilization of responsible gambling tools, particularly pointing out DraftKings’ data showing less than 0.1% of customers actively using time limits and only 2.3% utilizing deposit limits. Judd-Stein emphasized the need to make these tools more appealing to customers, urging DraftKings to take action to improve the figures.</p>
