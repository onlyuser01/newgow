    <h1>Spirit Lake Casino Payson Casino Gvr Casino Warhorse Casino Omaha Station Casinos Jobs Casino Moons</h1>

<p>Thank you, Ksail, for your reply. I have checked the abovementioned rule 2.5.7. and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"2.5.7. Bonuses offered by our casino are intended for genuine recreational players only. Abuse of any bonus offer will not be tolerated. We reserve the right to investigate, cancel, suspend or lock any account if bonus abuse is suspected. If an account is confirmed to fall under the Bonus Abuse category, we reserve the right to void all winnings generated on the account. At our discretion, all bonuses and subsequent gaming activity may be revoked and voided, and deposits returned.</p>
<p>If Your activity in Our Online Casino, by itself, is not abusive, but Your activities with other online merchants, as indicated by our fraud detection tools, constitutes abuse of Our bonuses, promotions, policies or rules.</p>
<p>Examples of bonus or promotion abuse, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>delaying game rounds in any game, including free spins and bonus features, to a later time when you have no wagering requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaving large bets on the table, for example in blackjack, and returning to the game after bonus wagering has been completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>claiming free bonuses that exceed a 3:1 bonus to deposit ratio (free bonuses include but are not limited to Free Spins, Calendar bonuses, Scratch Card bonuses, Tournament prizes, Race prizes, Mailer bonuses, Goodwill bonuses awarded by account managers, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>playing games with bonus money to build up in-game value, lose the bonus funds, and then cash out on the built-up value during real-money play;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using strategies that take advantage of any software bug or failure."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I understand correctly that the amount that you deposited into your casino account is $75 in total? Could you please forward a screenshot of your bonus history?</p>
