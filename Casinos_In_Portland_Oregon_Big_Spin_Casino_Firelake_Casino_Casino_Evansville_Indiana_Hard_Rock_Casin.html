    <h1>Casinos In Portland Oregon Big Spin Casino Firelake Casino Casino Evansville Indiana Hard Rock Casin</h1>

<p>Yeah I kind of understand that I am advised to wait two weeks for it to be in my account. But my problem here is that just the same thing happened to me at their "Sister" casino (mountgold.com), where they handled everything in a very professional manner, and found out they had made a mistake very early on in the process, and instantly took corrective actions. I kindly asked customer service why I didn't get the same treatment there, without any real response to the question.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my case was sent to their payments team for investigation, and I was told to send them a copy of my bank statement, probably for them to check if I actually hadn't received the funds or if I was lying. That case has now been laying with their payments team for just shy of 20-24 hours, and I haven't even got as much as an update on where my case is. If they have a reason for my money not being in my account yet, I am totally fine with it, even if they have made a mistake, its no worries, we are all humans that make mistakes from time to time.</p>
<p>The core of my problem here, is that they don't tell me anything, and don't give me any info regarding where my case is, or if they have discovered any problem.</p>
