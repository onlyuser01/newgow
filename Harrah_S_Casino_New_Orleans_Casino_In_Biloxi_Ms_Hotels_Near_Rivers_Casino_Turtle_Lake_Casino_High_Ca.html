    <h1>Harrah S Casino New Orleans Casino In Biloxi Ms Hotels Near Rivers Casino Turtle Lake Casino High Ca</h1>

<p>Hello Casino Guru Team!</p>
<p>I signed up at Excite Win online casino on 12/22/22. From my first (small) deposit of 75 euros (via Cash to Code credit) I quickly played my way up to currently around 1,600 euros (also still open bets worth 200 euros).</p>
<p>I wanted to create a payout for the first time on Wednesday, 12/28/22. I was then informed that the payment can only be made via the selected deposit method. After it was not possible to pay out via CashToCode, I deposited 10 euros via my credit card. I was then able to successfully create a payout. Unfortunately, I was not able to request a payout of 1,200 euros, only the maximum of 500 euros, but I thought "better than nothing for now". The withdrawal request was subsequently denied on Friday 12/30/22 without justification. After I sent a message to support, I was told there were "technical problems". A renewed withdrawal request from 30.12. Customer support rejected me again:</p>

<p>Again, no reason is given here. I am happy to share with you all the communication I have had with support so far in the attachment. (I can no longer attach the last message with the renewed rejection due to the maximum attachments of 5, but I inserted the text above)</p>
<p>I would be happy if you could help me with this problem. The casino does not seem to be completely reputable.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance and best regards</p>
