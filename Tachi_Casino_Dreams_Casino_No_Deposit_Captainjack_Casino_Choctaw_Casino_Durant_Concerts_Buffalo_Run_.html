    <h1>Tachi Casino Dreams Casino No Deposit Captainjack Casino Choctaw Casino Durant Concerts Buffalo Run</h1>

<p>On the 3rd of September, 2023, I won 1200 Euros at Lion Gems and wanted to transfer them to my account in Luxembourg. I had made some transactions to this account before, but at this time I was only able to withdraw 800 Euros, with plans to withdraw the remaining 700 Euros later. However, the payment from Alf Casino was canceled numerous times, without any stated reasons or notification emails. In discussions with the casino through chat, I was advised to choose a different method for withdrawal.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate this, I made a deposit using my Austrian account, in hopes I could transfer my winnings there. But this method didn't work either. Subsequently, I continued playing and have now lost everything except for 800 Euros. In the chat I couldn't identify the right withdrawal method, as I was always told to "choose another method". At one point, I was reduced to a potential withdrawal of 500 Euros.</p>
<p>I have been going to all lengths in order to retrieve at least the 800 Euros. But all attempts have been canceled. I tried smaller amounts like 260, 240, 200, 100 Euros, and made deposits using Mastercard even when there was still a balance. My account balance is currently 100 Euros, which continues to shrink. I still have hope to get some money back. But if I lose these last 100 Euros, I will close my account. For now, I am waiting for your response.</p>
<p>I would like to clarify that I made my own cancellations as well in order to continue playing, or to change the withdrawal method. During one of the games, which continued playing automatically without my supervision, my balance increased dramatically. I initially thought this was from a winning, but later realised it was due to a cancellation by Alf Casino.</p>
<p>Due to the series of delays and cancellations, my balance is now virtually at zero. Just yesterday, I tried transferring the remaining 200 Euros to a Mastercard but was informed that the transaction had failed. I was also given the option to verify the transaction but it indicated that the verification was unnecessary. Given that I only have two accounts-- one in Luxembourg linked to a Mastercard, and an Austrian account--I am left feeling desperate. It appears that I can't retrieve any of my money. This is highly unusual. Alf Casino is able to take my money in an instant but won't allow me to withdraw.</p>
<p>I have taken a few screenshots. Perhaps you can assist me, or at least provide relevant information to future players. I'm close to losing my last 100 Euros, after which I'll swear off this casino for good.</p>
<p>Here's a lucky player who ended up very disappointed.</p>
