<p>Sportradar has become the new official data distribution and betting live streaming partner of the International Cricket Council (ICC).</p>
<p>The partnership between the sports betting data and sports integrity supplier and cricket’s world governing body will cover eight major men’s and women’s international events, starting with the men’s ICC World T20 which gets underway on 17 October. The agreement will last through to the men’s ICC Cricket World Cup in 2023.</p>
<p>Sportradar said it will deploy its Cricket Live Score Plus (CLS+) data-capture tool which will allow fielding positions and actions to be plotted for the first time. Additionally, the solution will provide live ball-by-ball match data to media platforms via bespoke feeds and dedicated channels.</p>
<p>The supplier also mentioned that it will provide the ICC with bet monitoring and reporting for all 275 top-tier matches the partnership covers through its universal fraud detection system (UFDS), which scans for irregular betting patterns.</p>
<p>ICC Head of Digital Finn Bradshaw said: "Innovative use of sports data is one of the key pillars of our digital strategy. This partnership with Sportradar will help us grow our global cricket fanbase and deepen our engagement with it."</p>
<p>Sportradar sports content and partnerships Managing Director added: "Cricket is among the most popular sports globally, and we see huge potential to grow its fan base still further, helping fans interact with the game on an even deeper level."</p>
<p>"Our partnership with the ICC is an exciting step towards engaging those new fans and, with the full breadth of our unique technology powering it, we will deliver enhanced cricket content globally – across a range of platforms."</p>
<p>Sportradar’s network includes 1,000 media and sports-betting clients across 80 countries. Its partners include football governing bodies UEFA and AFC, along with World Rugby and World Snooker and the darts’ PDC.</p>
<p>In September, the supplier went public after completing its initial public offering (IPO), officially listing itself on the Nasdaq stock exchange.</p>
