    <h1>Twinspires Casino Revel Casino Hollywood Casino Morgantown Pa Bitofgold Casino Wynnbet Casino Saga K</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>First to give a better understanding, why I did decide to do a complaint.</p>
<p>Folkeriket with comeon and mobilebet had a campaign called "Evolution 500.000". This campaign said that: every time you bet at least NOK 250 on qualifying games in the live casino, you get a share of the prize pool. This campaign was seperated into two round, so the total amount in the prize pool was 1 million NOK. The maximum amount of pieces was regulated to 200 pieces each day.</p>
<p>The first round was between 1st - 14th of december, and the money should be given to the players within 20th of december.</p>
<p>The second round was 15-31th december, and the money will be given to the players within 5th of January.</p>
<p>With that said, I played for 67.581 NOK on qualifying games that gave me 270 shares of the prize pool.</p>
<p>Second round I did play for 304.826 NOk wich should be 1277 share.</p>
<p>Now over to the problem:</p>
<p>I did get in touch with the support team, and waited for reply. They then told me that I should get 250 NOK for my participation in round one. I then asked the loyalty team, because I did get a feeling that this was a wrong amount. The 250 NOK, did i never recieve either</p>
<p>The respond from loyalty team was that in this case it was 80 NOK per share, and since I only had played for 112 Euros, I only should get one share of the prize pot (80NOK). This 80 NOK did i never recieve either.</p>
<p>To understand from here, that they haven't a clue what to do, is for each 25 Euros you play for, it is one piece. How can 112 euros then only be one piece?</p>
<p>I then got the message about this was a campaign with raffle and it was not shared pot.</p>
<p>With then giving them proof of my playing historic, with what the actually campaign said. The respond I got was that the case was closed.</p>
<p>Following the case and the terms for the casino, you can give a complaint to the casino, and ยง1.4 state that the casino have seven working days to give a respond.</p>
<p>With the formal complaint sent to the casino, I have still not recieved any respond (16.01) and it have now gone over the deadilne for respond.</p>
<p>In the terms of the campaign, they say: "Folkeriket reserves the right not to pay out a prize where the winnings are due to an obvious error or technical error (including incorrect payouts of games)"</p>
<p>At my playing historic says, i haven't done anything wrong, and played fairly. I can't either see that as a "obvious error", both since casinos often have campaign like that, and even when the state of text is in bold text (both in the terms and front page).</p>
<p>With all of the mails between me and loyalty/support they changed the whole campaign on 05.01.2023. This is long after the campaign was done, and i see that as fraud to not be able to give back to the players who have been participated in this campaign.</p>
<p>With all that being said and everything: I did get 1547 share pieces in this campaign, and as the E-mail from them said that each piece is worth 80 NOK, i see this as 123.760 NOK missing.</p>
<p>With all proof of them changing the campaign after the ending, what they have said, and what the actual campaign said in the time of the campaign, I see this as a SCAM, and hope that Casino.Guru can help me get what i have played for.</p>
<p>If you need some more proof or better explanation, I will give it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Truls</p>
