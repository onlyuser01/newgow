    <h1>Heart Of Vegas Slot Casino Seminole Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Hollywood Horshoe Casino Isle Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru representatives, dear Evelin,</p>
<p>Thank you for inviting us into this thread.</p>
<p>We've been investigating the player's case and now we are ready to provide you with our official statement, based on our records, Finance Team, Customer Support chat/tickets/emails, and high-management decisions.</p>
<p>Initially, the player account was closed due to a violation of our General T&amp;C's (link for them can found here: https://select.bet/en/terms-and-conditions). Our Security Department detected a violation of our duplicated accounts policy namely that you have another account with the username "kacsa2020". Since the account with username "kacsa2020" is opened prior to the new one with the username "kacsa2021", the older one is considered the second consecutive opened account, and as much was permanently closed.</p>
<p>In accordance with our T&amp;C's and policy, the player's account was closed and the wrongfully gained account balance has been redeemed, hence the total amount of player's deposits has been returned.</p>
<p>The total deposited amount was issued and returned to the player's bank account. Please, consider checking with your bank about the possible Track &amp; Trace procedure of the transaction, so you could have more information regarding your account deposit balance.</p>
<p>Once again, we would like to remind you about our Terms &amp; Conditions, point 3.8.1 of "Account and Personal Information"</p>
<p>"The playerâ€™s account must be registered in his/her own, personal and correct, name and personal details. The individual has to ensure that all data given at the registration stage is true, complete, and free from error. Registration is allowed only once per person, family, household address, email address, payment account number, site cookies, IP address, and shared computer, i.e. Public library or workplace and cannot share any of the aforementioned with a previously registered account."</p>
<p>We believe both parties will find this informative.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,</p>
<p>The Select.Bet Casino Team</p>
