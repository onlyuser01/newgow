<p>Players can side with the samurai or the oni to win huge prizes</p>
<p>A month after the release of Midnight Marauder, Relax Gaming, a renowned provider and aggregator of iGaming content, has launched a samurai-themed game called Torii Tumble. Bushido enthusiasts can fire the reels of this new game to immediately get transported to the Land of the Rising Sun and choose whether to fight on the side of good or evil.</p>
<p>Torii Tumble Metrics</p>
<p>Rows: 6</p>
<p>6 Reels: 6</p>
<p>6 Paylines: Up to 46,656</p>
<p>Up to 46,656 RTP: 96.1%</p>
<p>96.1% Volatility: High</p>
<p>High Min/Max Bet: 0.20-50</p>
<p>0.20-50 Max Win: 20,000x</p>
<p>Fight for Good or Evil</p>
<p>During a game of Torii Tumble, players will collect various Japan-themed symbols, including stylized letters and samurai-themed symbols.</p>
<p>The new game offers players a huge win potential with the maximum bet being 20,000 times the stake. Players can enhance their wagers thanks to a variety of engaging mechanics. For example, the game features a famous tumble mechanic, a multiplier ladder, as well as multiplier boosters and spin savers.</p>
<p>Players can grab wild symbols which greatly improve their chance to score winning combinations and win big. In addition, players can land on bonus symbols represented by a gong icon. Should they grab three such symbols, players will trigger the bonus round.</p>
<p>The bonus round is where Torii Tumble really breaks ground. Once players trigger free spins mode, they will be presented with a choice, allowing them to select multiplier mode, spin save mode or mixed mode.</p>
<p>Multiplier mode will see the players side with the notorious oni for an increased chance of triggering high multipliers. Spin saver mode, on the other hand, will ally players with the honorable samurai for an increased chance of landing on spin saver symbols. Mixed mode, as the title suggests, is the perfect solution for those who want to have the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Once the bonus round finishes, players can use a gamble feature for a chance to win even more spins.</p>
<p>An Exciting Release for Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Shelley Hannah, Relax Gaming’s chief product officer, commented on the new game. She said that her company’s players delight in atmospheric warrior-themed titles such as Torii Tumble, which is why her team is so excited about the launch.</p>
<p>The tumble mechanic has proven to be a hit with players across various markets and to couple this with engaging features such as the Multiplier Ladder will make this a sure-fire success, and we expect players will be thoroughly entertained with this title. Shelley Hannah, CPO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Relax Gaming offers a rich collection of proprietary and aggregated content, allowing its partners to greatly enhance their content offerings.</p>
<p>In June, the company released Cluster Tumble DreamDrop, another slot packed with innovative mechanics.</p>
