    <h1>Turning Stone Resort Casino Sky River Casino Oxford Casino Hotel Casino Belgi Online Game Room Casin</h1>

<p>Online casino operator Rootz announced this week it has been granted an operating license in Ontario, allowing it to offer its suite of casino games to players in the Canadian province from January 2023.</p>
<p>Following the approval, the Rootz family of casinos is ready to hit the regulated market of Ontario and offer online casino players a taste of the immersive slot play provided by the operator’s brands Wildz, Spinz, Caxino and Wheelz.</p>
<p>Commenting on the key development for the company, Rootz’s chief executive officer Lasse Rantala outlined that expanding the company’s footprint into new regulated markets is part of the “dynamic strategy that seeks to provide innovative gaming solutions to players around the world.”</p>
<p>Ontario is an important market for us, and we welcome the opportunity provided by AGCO to become a licensed operator and to enter into an operational agreement with iGO. Lasse Rantala, CEO, Rootz</p>
<p>Rantala added that he is thankful to the company’s team for the efforts to make this licensing achievement possible.</p>
<p>Offering a vast range of online games ranging from slots to live casino games and featuring a selection of old favorite titles and brand new releases developed in collaboration with some of the world’s top games developers, Rootz casinos strive to offer its players a safe and secure gaming environment.</p>
<p>… as an operator, we prioritize the need for safe, secure and fair play; the strict compliance requirements within regulated markets such as Ontario and Germany will provide peace of mind to our customers that they are enjoying play experiences with a licensed provider. Lasse Rantala, CEO, Rootz</p>
<p>Ontario became the second regulated gaming jurisdiction Rootz has obtained market access for, following in the footsteps of Germany. In September last year, Rootz received a license to offer online slot games via its wildz, wheelzgames and spinz German websites, signaling the operator’s compliance with Germany’s new State Treaty on Gambling.</p>
<p>Immersive Slot Play</p>
<p>Players in Ontario will be able to taste firsthand slots such as Big Bass Bonanza, Game of Thrones and Immortal Romance, while Rootz will be releasing new titles on a continuous basis, alongside promotions and featured games.</p>
<p>Most of the games offered at Rootz casino brands include demo play mode to allow players to figure out the mechanics of gameplay, including bonuses, rewards and even jackpots, while the lobby will surprise them with themes and styles not seen before.</p>
<p>The new license ensures that Rootz’ brands are compliant with the guidelines of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission (AGCO) and iGaming Ontario (iGO), including prevention of access to casinos for underage people and support for responsible gambling initiatives. Tools such as personal limits, timeouts, self-exclusion and reality checks are utilized by Rootz to make the online casino experience a pleasant and responsible one.</p>
