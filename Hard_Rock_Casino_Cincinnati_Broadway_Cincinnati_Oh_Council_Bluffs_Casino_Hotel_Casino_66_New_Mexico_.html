<p>Yahoo Boosts Social Gaming Presence with Wagr Buy</p>

<p>In an effort to further solidify its already expansive fantasy sports footprint and potentially expand further into sports wagering, Yahoo announced Tuesday it’s acquiring Wagr, a peer-to-peer sports betting app.</p>

<p>Financial terms of the transaction, which has already closed, weren’t disclosed. Privately held Wagr was the first social gaming company in the US to land a sports wagering permit, having done so in Tennessee.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Wagr is an exciting step in the development of the next generation of Yahoo Sports’ gaming portfolio,” said Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone in a statement. “Wagr stands out for their innovative emphasis on community and social engagement in sports gaming, which aligns perfectly with the Yahoo award-winning fantasy platform that has brought tens of millions of fans together around their love of sports for over 20 years.”</p>
<p>Yahoo is 90% owned by private equity giant Apollo Global Management, which has extensive gaming industry experience. Verizon Communications owns the other 10%.</p>
<p>Sensible Acquisition for Yahoo</p>
<p>Yahoo acquiring Wagr makes for a practical bolt-on acquisition for the buyer’s Yahoo Sports arm.</p>
<p>That’s one of the parent company’s most profitable and visited units. It has the second-largest fantasy sports platform, behind only ESPN, and has recently attempted to broaden its footprint in the sports wagering space.</p>
<p>Last year, speculation surfaced that Apollo wanted to merge Yahoo Sports with an established sportsbook operator, but a deal didn’t materialize. For Apollo, the acquisition of a sportsbook operator makes sense because Yahoo Sports has millions of fantasy sports players who could be converted to sports bettors.</p>
<p>That playbook was used by FanDuel and DraftKings, which started out as daily fantasy sports (DFS) companies, and now combine to control approximately three-quarters of the domestic online sports betting market.</p>
<p>Wagr will be fully integrated into Yahoo Sports. The target brings “extensive experience in social mobile app development, user experience and community driven games,” according to the statement.</p>
<p>Impressive Investor Roster</p>
<p>As has been the case with so many emerging growth companies in the fantasy sports and sports betting industries, Wagr attracted some well-known investors. Those include venture capitalists and professional team owners.</p>
<p>Wagr has attracted significant investments from renowned organizations, individuals, and prominent venture capital firms including Seven Seven Six, led by Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian; Greycroft; Pear VC; the Kraft Group, owners of the New England Patriots and New England Revolution; Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment, owners of the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils and BITKRAFT Ventures,” according to the press release.</p>
<p>Kraft Group was an early investor in DraftKings, among other sports companies. A group led by Harris is in pole position to acquire the NFL’s Washington Commanders.</p>
