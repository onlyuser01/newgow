    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Tampa Tampa Free Sweeps Cash Casinos Avi Resort And Casino Silver Sl</h1>

<p>The regulated Dutch market is one that Swintt has had its eye on ever since obtaining certification for its games there last year, CEO Mann said.</p>
<p>Swintt, which just signed a Lithuania-facing deal with 7Bet, has now further expanded its presence in Europe by inking an agreement with 711 in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Last year, Swintt secured a license from the Kansspelautoriteit, which allowed it to supply local operators with its products. As a result, the provider was now able to join forces with 711, allowing its players to access a huge selection of new games.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Swintt will power its new ally with titles from its SwinttPremium and SwinttGames collections. In addition, the company will supply the operator with aggregated content from third-party studios.</p>
<p>Swintt expects Dutch customers to love the SwinttPremium games, considering their popularity in Germany. The games that will make their way to SwinttPremium’s platform include titles such as Master of Books Unlimited, Extra Win X and Duolitos Garden. Innovative games like Aloha Spirit XtraLockTM and Candy Gold will also be available to 711 customers.</p>
<p>Finally, Swintt will leverage its SwinttStudios program to power the operator with games from other studios. As a result, gamblers in the Netherlands will be able to try out Fine Edge Gaming’s Stacking Bisons slot.</p>
<p>More games will be added to the deal in the following weeks.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Excited to Work Together</p>
<p>711’s chief operating officer, Gilles de Backer, lauded Swintt as “one of the most exciting and ambitious software developers” in iGaming. He added that he is very excited to join forces with the studio.</p>
<p>From classic slots to the state-of-the-art releases, there’s something for everyone in the Swintt catalog and we’re sure their titles will prove hugely popular with our players. Gilles de Backer, COO, 711</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Swintt’s chief executive officer, David Mann, said that the Netherlands is a very important market for his company. Mann explained that Swintt has been looking to expand its presence in the region ever since securing a license. Because of that, he is happy about the agreement with 711.</p>
<p>The regulated Dutch market is one that Swintt has had its eye on ever since obtaining certification for our games there last year, so we’re absolutely thrilled to now be able to offer a selection of our titles at 711. David Mann, CEO, Swintt</p>
<p>Mann concluded that 711 is a very popular brand in the country and will therefore be the “perfect platform” for Swintt to share its games with local gambling enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Last month Swintt released a new action-packed title called Jade Princess. In March, the supplier also penned a partnership agreement with PressEnter, allowing it to launch its games in new regions.</p>
