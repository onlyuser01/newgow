    <h1>Graton Resort Casino Hayward Casino Online Casino Top 7 Cedars Casino Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>In total, I've made 1200 Euro's worth of deposits on their website - their system charged me twice for one of the deposit's so 1400 Euro's has been debited from my bank account! - and prior to the account being blocked my balance was 1549.72 Euro's.</p>
<p>On Monday 6th September 2021, I emailed Customer Support and asked them to close my account with immediate effect and asked for any funds held on my account to be reimbursed to my bank account. Instead of refunding the money, Crazy Star simply locked access to my account and confirmed that I no longer had access to funds held on my online wallet. The only way to access funds was to reinstate the account - which I have requested approx. 4 working days ago - and they are stating there are 'no timescales' for the request to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Whenever I message someone from the Crazy Star Customer Service Team they simply restate 'there are no timescales for the request to be reviewed' and whenever I've stated that I feel they are being dishonest or fraudulent with their behaviour they reply "there is nothing like a scam about our casino".</p>
<p>In short, they have removed access to my online wallet - which contains over 1500+ Euros' on the premise that the request for my account to be unlocked is being removed - but they refuse to give any timescales as to how long this might take?!</p>
<p>I've done further investigations on the holding company (see below) and it would appear that EVERY casino linked to this business is unlicensed and they have endless reviews about stealing player funds etc.</p>
