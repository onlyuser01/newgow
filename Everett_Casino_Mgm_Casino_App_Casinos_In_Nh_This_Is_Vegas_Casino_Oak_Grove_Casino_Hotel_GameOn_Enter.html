    <h1>Everett Casino Mgm Casino App Casinos In Nh This Is Vegas Casino Oak Grove Casino Hotel GameOn Enter</h1>

<p>GameOn Entertainment has revealed that David Meltzer will be joining the company’s board of directors. The new appointment comes with the ambitious long-term goal to boost the company’s profitability by analyzing key performance metrics and introducing improvements across the board.</p>
<p>Meltzer Has Versatile Business Experience</p>
<p>Meltzer is a well-seasoned veteran who is well-versed in the gambling and entertainment industry. He previously served as chief executive officer at Leigh Steinberg Sports &amp; Entertainment, a consulting firm, and agency that represented athletes.</p>
<p>Other related stints include his position as co-founder of Sports 1 Marketing, a company that focuses on “maximizing the value of its clients” by creating unique business opportunities. Overall, Meltzer’s experience with both companies has enabled him to cultivate the skills that would now make him an important addition to GameOn Entertainment’s own board.</p>
<p>Welcoming the appointment of Meltzer, GameOn CEO Matt Bailey said that the new member of the board will be vital in ensuring that the company pursues its long-term strategic goals of achieving better revenue and profitability.</p>
<p>“An industry veteran like Dave will have an immediate impact on our business,” GameOn CEO Matt Bailey. Meltzer’s experience goes well beyond executive corporate structures and boards. He’s also a TV series producer and an author.</p>
<p>The Playbook Host and Well-Seasoned Executive</p>
<p>Meltzer is also hosting “The Playbook,” a podcast that is meant to offer aspiring entrepreneurs advice on how to navigate the investment world and do business. Summing up Meltzer’s competencies and experience, Bailey added:</p>
<p>“His network and experience in the precise space we are in is second-to-none. Dave is an excellent addition to the team who I’m excited to continue building the future of our company with.” GameOn CEO Matt Bailey</p>
<p>GameOn has also announced a few changes to its existing executive lineup. For example, J Moses stepped down from the role of a director of the board last week and became a non-board advisor to the CEO. Moses was immediately replaced by Carey Dillen, who is now the new chairwoman of the board.</p>
