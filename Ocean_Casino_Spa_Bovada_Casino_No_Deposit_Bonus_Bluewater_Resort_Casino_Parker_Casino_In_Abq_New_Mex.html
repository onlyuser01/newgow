<p>White Rabbit Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The world of Lewis Carroll’s Alice In Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass are an instantly recognisable source for all manner of whacky imagery and fantastical worlds.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are plenty of slot machines which have picked up Carroll’s mantle and turned his characters into slots. Few are as iconic as the White Rabbit, Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat, all of who make an appearance in this slot.</p>
<p>Not many slots have adapted from the book to a slot machine with as much aplomb as White Rabbit Megaways does.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are excellent in this slot. The characters on the reels are given a kind of halfway real CGI look that is just lovely and match perfectly with the detailed and gorgeous background, in which one can make out the caterpillar with its hookah.</p>
<p>All of this is accompanied by a well chosen musical track that avoids annoying the player and adds to the sense of atmosphere that the slot is aiming for.</p>
<p>Not only is everything beautifully designed and drawn, but it is all held together perfectly with a consistency of style.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>As the title suggests, White Rabbit Megaways makes use of the Megaways reel system. This means that as well as being an any way wins slot – where wins are awarded for any combination of identical symbols in adjacent reels starting from the left – the five reels will contain a random number of symbols between two and seven. As a result, the number of possible win ways changes from spin to spin.</p>
<p>The game also includes a randomly triggered feature, as well as two bonus games, including a Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, Cupcake and Feature Drop symbol.</p>
<p>Three Scatter symbols in one spin will trigger a Free Spin bonus with fifteen Free Spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins, the reels are changed. Every reel starts out with seven symbols. If a Cupcake symbol lands on a reel, the reel will extend, up to a maximum of twelve symbols. If a reel reaches twelve symbols high, that reel becomes a Queen’s Reel and between three and twelve free spins are added to the total number of free spins.</p>
<p>As a Queen’s reel, the 12 symbol high reel will have more high valued Red Queen and Wild symbols on it.</p>
<p>If waiting for the Scatter symbol to trigger the bonus for you is too much, you can buy straight into the Free Spin bonus using the buy button on the Feature Drop counter.</p>
<p>Each Feature Drop symbol that lands on the reel will reduce the price on the Feature Drop counter, lowering the price of buying into the free spins directly. If the price reaches zero, the Free Spin bonus will automatically trigger.</p>
<p>The Caterpillar Feature will trigger at random. When it does, the Caterpillar blows smoke rings that add multiplier Wilds at random to the reels.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 97.72%. Which is great, greatly exceeding our yardstick for average of roughly 96%, by over 1.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€200.00 per spin. This range encompasses everyone from the penny player up to the highest of rollers.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high. This means White Rabbit Megaways makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies, which target the highest possible variance. Combined with the high RTP, the maths alone makes this slot a strong favourite.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>White Rabbit Megaways is a masterpiece of slot machine design. It is attractive to look at, easy to play, and comes with a bunch of interesting features that are paced to escalate in a way that makes them thrilling.</p>
<p>On top of this, the maths makes it a great match for our preferred slot strategies. The high return to player and even higher volatility makes this one of the better slots out there.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend this slot.</p>
