<p>The leading provider of advice, information and support for anyone affected by gambling harm, GamCare, announced changes to its senior management team. The charity confirmed that its CEO, Anna Hemmings, has taken the decision to step down from her role. The announcement comes after she was at the helm of GamCare for five years and helped guide the charity through many obstacles.</p>
<p>With Hemmings as CEO, the charity grew its presence in the digital, as well as traditional channels, allowing it to expand further its support and education offering. At the same time, under the guidance of the CEO, GamCare focused on "enhancing the role of lived experience within the organization," a statement reveals.</p>
<p>An important achievement Hemmings played a key role in is the extended reach of GamCare. This enabled the charity to reach people that need support and help them effectively. Moreover, the CEO helped navigate the organization through the pandemic, the release of the Gambling Act and contributed greatly to processes related to new agreements.</p>
<p>According to GamCare, the charity's Chair, will spearhead the organization as CEO for the moment. This change will be in effect while GamCare officially recruits a new CEO. "​The board would like to thank Anna for her hard work during her tenure and wishes her all the very best for the future," explains the charity.</p>
<p>Margot Daly, GamCare's Chair of Trustees, pointed out that under the guidance of Hemmings, the charity expanded further its position and reached more people that need support and treatment. "She leaves GamCare in a stronger position and has ensured that more people than ever before have been​, and can now be,​ helped," said Daly.</p>
<p>The Chair of Trustees explained that Hemmings leveraged a unique and innovative approach that guided GamCare through different obstacles and enabled it to break from the traditional channels, entering into the digital realm. Finally, Daly said: "On behalf of the charity’s board, I would like to thank Anna most sincerely for everything she has achieved to bring GamCare to this point."</p>
<p>Hemmings commented on the topic as well, explaining that it was a privilege to be at the helm of GamCare for the last five years. She said that during that time, the charity changed in many ways and was able to reach thousands of people affected by gambling.</p>
<p>"I'm very proud of both the services and the staff and culture at GamCare, and I would like to thank all my amazing colleagues and the phenomenal network of stakeholders for their dedication and support during my time as CEO," said Hemmings. Finally, she pointed out that while it's time for her to explore new opportunities, she leaves GamCare in safe hands.</p>
