<p>Both Teams Want to Do Well in 2021</p>
<p>Both teams have very high ambitions in 2021, which isn’t surprising knowing that they have very strong rosters this season.</p>
<p>The Titans seem to have never been this strong in the franchise history, especially when it comes to the offense. Not only do they have one of the best running backs in the league (Derrick Henry), but starting with the 2021 NFL season, the Titans also got one of the best wide receivers on the planet (Julio Jones).</p>
<p>It’s a similar case when it comes to the Cardinals, whose quarterback, Kyler Murray, is expected to take a big leap forward in his third NFL season. They also have a pretty good defense, with outside linebacker Chandler Jones as the standout player.</p>
<p>Jon Jones’ little brother (who is 6’5, weighing 265 lbs) is the man who could make or break the Cardinals against the Titans. If he shines on Sunday and stops Tennessee’s offensive plays, it could be enough for his team to get a win.</p>
<p>Henry, Brown, Jones – Can Anyone Stop These Guys?</p>
<p>In 2020, the Titans running back, Derrick Henry, won the Offensive Player of the Year award, after rushing for 2,027 and scoring 17 touchdowns. The same season, wide receiver A. J. Brown recorded 1,075 receiving yards and scored 11 touchdowns.</p>
<p>These two were the only Titans to get an invite to the 2020 Pro Bowl and are expected to do pretty much the same in 2021. That seems like a guarantee that we’ll see Tennessee scoring a lot of points this season.</p>
<p>Last season they scored 491 points (second-best score in the AFC); this season, we expect them to do even better. The reason is that in addition to Henry and Brown, they now also have Julio Jones in their offensive team. The ex-Atlanta Falcons wide receiver is thought of as one of the best players in his position in the entire league.</p>
<p>The Cardinals look like one of the not-too-many teams that could put up a decent fight against Tennessee’s offense. The trouble is that the Titans’ offensive is just much more superior. However, this team’s defense isn’t that great, which is something the Cardinals offense will try to exploit. As a result, we could see plenty of points on both ends.</p>
