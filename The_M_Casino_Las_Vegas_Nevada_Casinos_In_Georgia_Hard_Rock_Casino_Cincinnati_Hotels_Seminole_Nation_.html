    <h1>The M Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casinos In Georgia Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati Hotels Seminole Nation</h1>

<p>Thanks for the reply, completely understandable and thank you for your continued assistance.</p>
<p>Minimum bet on their platform seems to be .25 cents. Wagering requirements weren’t visible as when I’d make a deposit post welcome bonus/initial deposit… the money would go straight to real money.</p>
<p>Also… I kind of caught them slipping. Please see below -</p>
<p>Do you see how one I can cancel and one I can not? They lock their customers into the welcome bonus forcing them to complete 50x wager requirements, DESPITE DEPOSITS AFTER THE INITIAL DEPOSIT.</p>
<p>Which is the perfect segway to further showcase how they cheated and lied and misuse their T&amp;Cs and make withdrawing impossible as they do their absolute best to delay approving verification.</p>
<p>So $6,506.70 was confiscated and they cited this rule…</p>
<p>58.3.3 in its entirety - 58.3.3 All Freespins, Freebets, Bonus Chips, are valid for a period of 7 days from the time when they are credited to the players’ account. After the period of 7 days the aforementioned promotional materials expire and are not claimable or refundable. Max winnings from Cashback / Loyalty Bonus are limited to five (5x) times the initial amount of Cashback Bonus given. Any winnings above that will be forfeited. Max winnings from season/special promotions (including, but not limited to, Christmas Bonuses, Easter Bonuses, Halloween Bonuses) for 200% and above Bonus threshold, are limited to four (4x) times the initial deposit amount. Max winnings for bonuses between 150% - 199% Bonus threshold, are limited to eight (8x) times the initial deposit amount. Max winnings for bonuses between 120% - 149% threshold, are limited to ten (10x) times the initial deposit amount. Max winnings for bonuses between 100% - 119% threshold, are limited to fifteen (15x) times the initial deposit amount. Max winnings for bonuses between 25% - 99% threshold, are limited to twenty (20x) times the initial deposit amount. Any winnings above that limits will be forfeited.</p>
<p>So this 130% welcome bonus that we established 1) could not be cancelled unlike the other bonus we can see from the image 2) no bet of $1.30 or anything to eliminate this amount could have been wagered 3) most importantly for this rule and wrongful confiscation - their T&amp;C rule mentions "INITIAL DEPOSIT."</p>
<p>This was not the initial deposit, this was the result of my betting after 5 $400 deposits including the initial deposit. Those were my funds and are not subject to having a cap of winnings as this was not the result of betting and winning with solely the first deposit and the welcome bonus.</p>
<p>They are being disgusting, cowardly and wrongly citing their terms and conditions. They aren’t automated in so many ways yet their "system" managed to take over HALF of my hard earned money.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, it took them over 9 days to fully verify my account despite them putting in WRITING that it takes up to 72 hours. I was unable to withdraw thus losing a 5k balance and then another 4k balance. Insanity.</p>
<p>"Dear Conor</p>
<p>We wish to inform you that all documents are reviewed by the relevant department within the next 72 hours.</p>
<p>Once your documents have been accepted, we will notify you accordingly via email.</p>
<p>You also had the opportunity to request a withdrawal any time."</p>
<p>The last part is also completely false as when I went to request a withdrawal it would decline even processing as my account wasn’t fully verified.</p>
<p>Long story short… I built my balance up to 15k from my 5th $400 deposit. I did not build my balance up from $1.30 that I couldn’t cancel or wager. On top of that, when I’d deposit the funds would go to "real money." And I have proof of this. Treasure spins has to be the most incompetent, untrustworthy, disgusting online casino to have ever existed. They are willfully and purposely negligent, don’t know how their own website works, lack automation, lack a live chat feature, and are incapable of admitting wrong doing.</p>
<p>I need you to step in and reach out and help. I blew many balances because of my inability to withdraw despite them saying it would only take 72 hours. I need the $6,506 e-transfered to me in one instalment and not this bullshit cap they put of $500 a day. They should be blacklisted in all honesty they don’t deserve a place on the internet.</p>
<p>Please help</p>
