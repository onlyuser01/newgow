<p>AutoBet will revolutionize the betting market, while REEVO will power Digitain with content</p>
<p>Digitain has made two important announcements, unveiling a deal with REEVO and the launch of AutoBet, a brand-new solution.</p>
<p>AutoBet Revolutionizes Betting</p>
<p>According to Digitain, AutoBet is an unparalleled betting feature that will change the entire sports betting industry. The provider explained that the new solution allows customers to be in control and define their preferred odds range. This provides an important level of customization, catering to the needs of various player types.</p>
<p>Digitain explained that AutoBet is intuitive and efficient. Once players log into their accounts, they can choose the event and market they wish to bet on and select their preferred odds range. If such odds exist, the system will automatically place the bet, saving players a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>In the meantime, gambling companies can customize AutoBet for single bets, multibets or both.</p>
<p>Zohrab Karapetyan, chief of sportsbook product at Digitain, said that he is thrilled about the launch of AutoBet. He said that his team is committed to delivering solutions that truly cater to players’ and operators’ needs.</p>

<p>Digitain Teams up with REEVO</p>
<p>In the meantime, Digitain formed a new partnership with REEVO, a fast-growing content provider and aggregator. Under the deal, Digitain secured access to REEVO’s rich portfolio of content, allowing it to tap into an extensive library of high-performance slot and table games.</p>
<p>The REEVO content will now be available on Digitain’s Centrivo Dynamics and Centrivo Universal platforms via the latter company’s aggregation service.</p>
<p>The deal was welcomed by Digitain’s director of international relations, Ashot Sahakyan, who said that his team has admired REEVO for a while. According to Sahakyan, the latter company shares his team’s commitment to innovation and customer and player-centric solutions.</p>
<p>This agreement reinforces our company and brand values to deliver the optimal and best performing iGaming content to our growing partners globally. Ashot Sahakyan, director of international relations, Digitain</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO’s head of sales, also commented on the matter, saying that her team is pleased to be teaming up with Digitain.</p>
