    <h1>Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Guitar Casino Casino With Hotel Near Me Vblink Casino Casino Meaning Pixb</h1>

<p>To Casino Guru, I come through this post to apologize for any inconvenience or inconvenience that I may cause or may be causing.</p>
<p>Because I really admire and am a fan of Casino Guru because he is honest and friendly.</p>
<p>But due to some complaints that I made and I have from some casinos, and in particular Casino PixBet, because I found and came to the conclusion that Casino Pixbet or some providers of slot games like Pragmatc Play, mainly about the Super game 7s.. are maliciously defrauding, manipulating and even programming respective slots and games, so that they do not pay the prize to the player.</p>
<p>I say this for the simple fact that I already know some online slot games and also their suppliers, and already knowing what the RPT payment values are for each game or slot specified here by me.</p>
<p>And because I'm talking about the game Super 7s from the supplier Pragmatc Play, and that this game has an RPT of about 96.7% payout, which you can find in several online casinos, and also in Pixbet Casino... This game is yes being manipulated, programmed not to pay the due prizes to the players and also showing many flaws in the betting process within the game... Something is not right, mainly playing this game in the PixBet Casino</p>
<p>Other Casinos that also have this respective game work perfectly for the player, but unfortunately on the website or even through the PixBet Casino app, this game has many flaws and apparent technical problems.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of being able to record my cell phone screen playing this game at another online Casino, whose name is irrelevant, and everything went smoothly both with the game itself and with the recording.</p>
<p>However, I needed to somehow recant the complaint I made about Casino Pixbet, so I decided once again to make a minimum deposit into my Casino PixBet account and play this same game, as I always played for the Casino.</p>
<p>So I started playing and did the same procedure I did at the other Casino, I set it to record my cell phone screen playing this game with real money.</p>
<p>When the recording ended, once again I lost all my balance inside the Casino playing this game, I went to watch the recording that I had made playing this game at PixBet Casino, and simply all the time I recorded the game, it stayed with the screen black, and at no time is it possible to see any image of the game, because I believe that something prevented the recording of the game from being able to be done on my cell phone screen.</p>
<p>I will attach here in this message, a recording that I made playing this same game in another online Casino, and also the recording that I made playing in Pixbet Casino, where no image can be seen for a brief and supposed conclusion of the problems and failures that this game is having at Pixbet Casino.</p>
<p>I thank Casino Guru in advance for their tolerance and patience with my attitudes.</p>
<p>I tried to attach the videos here, but I was unsuccessful</p>
<p>That's why I'm going to email</p>
