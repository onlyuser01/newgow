<p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr is still without a win since the start of the 2023 season of the Saudi Pro League, but they probably feel good about their chances ahead of the trip to Al-Hasa, where they’re going to play against Al Fateh this Friday</p>
<p>Even though the roster of Al Nassr is packed with superstars – Cristiano Ronaldo, Sadio Mane, Talisca, Marcelo Brozovic, to name a few – this team isn’t doing well in the 2023 Saudi Professional League.</p>
<p>These guys lost their first two games of the new season, meaning that it’s high time for them to start playing better. That said, the big question is whether they’re going to get their first win of the season on Friday, August 25, when they travel to Al-Hasa to take on Al Fateh.</p>
<p>Al Fatah vs. Al Nassr Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Al Fatah +350 Draw +235 Al Nassr -182</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 2.5 -175 Under 2.5 +135</p>

<p>Al Fateh Looking for Its First Home Win Over Al Nassr Since 2016</p>
<p>Al Fateh is 1-1-0 in the 2023 Saudi Professional League, while last season, we saw this team finish sixth with a 13-4-13 record. What’s interesting is that only six of those 13 wins happened on this team’s turf.</p>
<p>Speaking of home turf, Al Fateh has won only one game against Al Nassr at Al-Hasa in history. It happened in 2016, and they’re winless at home against this opponent in seven games.</p>
<p>Al Fateh has played one home game in the new season. It happened on August 13 when we saw them draw 1-1 with Al Taawon. Moroccan winger Mourad Batna was brilliant in that game. Actually, he’s been Al Fateh’s best player so far, along with Feras Al Brikan, who was this team’s scoring leader in the previous season.</p>
<p>Al Nassr is Great Offensively, Poor in the Defense</p>
<p>With players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Sadio Mane, and Talisca in the front three, Al Nassr looks capable of scoring against any opponent in the 20232 Saudi Professional League. Plus, this season, this team also has Marcelo Brozovic in the middle of the field, as well as Otavio who’s yet to make his debut after coming from Porto a few days ago.</p>
<p>That said, Al Nassr’s fans have nothing to worry about their boys doing well offensively, but what about their defense? In one word, it’s horrible. The defense is Al Nassr’s Achilles heel in 2023, as evident that they’ve already conceded four goals after two rounds.</p>
<p>The worst thing is that their opponents in those two games were Al Ettifaq and Al Taawon, two teams that aren’t famous for being great offensive powerhouses.</p>
<p>Al Fateh vs. Al Nassr Prediction</p>
<p>Al Nassr will win this game, we have no doubt about that. A third straight loss in the 2023 Saudi Professional League would mean that there’s something seriously wrong with this team. But we don’t think it is. Al Nassr’s defense is leaky for sure, but its offense is good enough to make up for it.</p>
<p>Pick: Al Nassr to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
