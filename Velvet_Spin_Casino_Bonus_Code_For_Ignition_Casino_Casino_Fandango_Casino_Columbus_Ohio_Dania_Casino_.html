<p>Tori Magnum, 21, is being held at the Clark County Detention Center on two felony counts of sex trafficking a child under 18 and two felony counts of living from the earnings of a prostitute, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. She is due in court April 29 for a preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>Vice detectives encountered Magnum on March 29 when responding to a fight between her and one of the girls at an apartment on South 13th Street in Las Vegas, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>One girl told police Magnum choked her for at first refusing to work as a prostitute. According to the teenager, she was to split her earnings with Magnum.</p>
<p>On March 28, the girl met a man in downtown Las Vegas. He invited her into his vehicle and paid $300 for sex. Magnum received $200. The girl kept $100, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.</p>
<p>The second girl said she met Magnum in late March. Magnum asked if the youth wanted to work as a prostitute. Magnum then sent her to a hotel on the Strip. She was paid an undisclosed amount to have sex. She received $40 for the encounter, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Magnum told authorities she knew the girls were working as prostitutes, but denied having a role in these activities. She said the youths were paying rent to stay at her home.</p>
<p>Police found photographs of the teenagers on a website that posts prostitution advertisements, according to KLAS-TV. The photographs showed them “in sexual positions or partially nude,” the television station reported.</p>
<p>‘Cowboy Buckles and Boots”</p>
<p>This is one of several recent cases involving suspected sex trafficking on or near the near the Strip.</p>
<p>Last fall, police in Las Vegas arrested a 49-year-old man accused of telling an underage female to charge $500 for each sexual encounter as a prostitute.</p>
<p>She also was told to look for men wearing “cowboy buckles and boots” as potential good customers.</p>
<p>The juvenile was told to make each customer drink a shot of liquor to be sure the person was not an undercover officer, police said.</p>
<p>Prostitution Legal at Brothels</p>
<p>Prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas and Reno, but is permitted at legal brothels in some rural Nevada counties. Nevada is the only state with legal prostitution.</p>
<p>Last year, Lyon County sex worker Alice Little sued Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) for ordering brothels closed during the coronavirus pandemic. She called the closures “arbitrary.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Little dropped the legal battle against Sisolak, saying it was financially costly, according to the Reno Gazette-Journal. She said her legal bill had reached six figures. A GoFundMe effort to raise $80,000 had only collected $14,200 by January, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>On her website, Little lists herself as “a proponent of sex positivity and women’s rights.” She says she is a founder of Hookers for Healthcare.</p>
<p>Sisolak has ordered brothels and other adult entertainment venues, including nightclubs and strip clubs, to close at least through May 1 to curtail the spread of COVID-19.</p>
