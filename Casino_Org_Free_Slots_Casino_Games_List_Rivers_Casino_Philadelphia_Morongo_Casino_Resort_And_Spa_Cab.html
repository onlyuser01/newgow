<p>February marks another strong month for the gambling operators in Atlantic City, New Jersey, based on results released by the regulator on Wednesday. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) released the gaming revenue results for the operators in February 2022.</p>
<p>In January 2022, racetracks, casinos and their partners reported $381.7 million in total gaming revenue. This marked a 10.3% increase when compared to the $346.2 million in total gaming revenue reported for the same period in 2021.</p>
<p>The same positive trend carried on last month, considering that total gaming revenue hit $373.3 million. This result marked a significant 29.5% increase when compared to the $288.3 million in total gaming revenue reported in February 2021.</p>
<p>Breakdown of the total gaming revenue shows that total casino win for the nine casinos and hotel properties hit $212.4 million last month, marking a 43.3% increase when compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Further breakdown of the casino win also shows more than 40% increase for slot machine and table game win. During February 2022, slot machine win hit $153.9 million, while table game win hit $58.4 million, marking an increase of 42.9% and 44.5% respectively.</p>
