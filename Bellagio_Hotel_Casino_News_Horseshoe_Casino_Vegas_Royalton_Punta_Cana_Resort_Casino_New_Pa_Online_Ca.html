<p>Vegas Golden Knights Looking Unbeatable</p>
<p>The Golden Knights lead the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals 2-0, blowing the Florida Panthers each time. In Game 1, they won 5-2 with five different players scoring a goal. Five different Vegas players got on the scoresheet in Game 2, which the Golden Knights won 7-2. Jonathan Marchessault and Brett Howden each scored two goals in that match.</p>
<p>Jonathan Marchessault now has 9 goals in 9 games.</p>

<p>Marchessault is Vegasâ€™s scoring leader, which is why itâ€™s no surprise he did great against the Panthers. Howdenâ€™s performance came as a sort of surprise considering that he scored just 7 goals in the 54 games he played in the regular season.</p>
<p>Another surprising thing is that Vegasâ€™s second-highest scorer Jack Eichel did not score a single goal in the two games of the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals. He did, however, record four assists.</p>
<p>Florida Panthers Need Help of Their Fans</p>
<p>The Panthers got to the postseason after booking the last available spot in the Eastern Conference. On the road to the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals, they knocked out the Boston Bruins (4-3 in the series), Toronto Maple Leafs (4-1), and Carolina Hurricanes (4-0).</p>
<p>When it started looking as if theyâ€™d lifted their form to the maximum, the Stanley Cup Finals came. And the Panthers got destroyed by the Golden Knights in both games played so far. They still have a chance to fight back, and this time, itâ€™s on their turf.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, they havenâ€™t been great in Florida this season. They were 23-5-13 at home in the regular season, while going 3-0-3 in the postseason.</p>
<p>Vegas Golden Knights vs Florida Panthers Game 3 Prediction</p>
<p>The Vegas Golden Knights are way, way better than the Florida Panthers. Theyâ€™ve got a much better roster, with a number of players who could shine on Thursday. That said, we think itâ€™s very likely theyâ€™re going to win Game 3, although probably not by a huge margin as was the case in the previous two games of the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals.</p>
<p>Pick: Vegas Golden Knights to win</p>
