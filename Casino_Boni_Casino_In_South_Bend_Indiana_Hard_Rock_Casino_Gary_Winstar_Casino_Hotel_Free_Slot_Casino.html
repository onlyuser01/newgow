<p>Sports betting operator LV Bet has inked a stadium naming rights partnership with Boreham Wood FC, a British National League soccer team. The company hopes that it can establish its brand and lead to higher visibility with Boreham Wood fans as well as sports audiences through coverage on Sky Sports, BT Sport, and Twitch.</p>
<p>Gambling Companies Remain Confident in Sports Partnerships</p>
<p>The stadium plays hosts numerous events, including the Arsenal’s Women’s Premier League games and Men’s U-18, 19, and 23. LV Bet has followed up on numerous partnerships across Europe and the United Kingdom, with a West Bromwich Albion alliance and engaging with various social initiatives and campaigns.</p>
<p>Through the latest tie-up, LV Bet hopes to achieve better recognition and associate its name with Women’s football. LV Bet CMO Markin Jablonski had this to say about the tie-up: “Boreham Wood FC has been great to deal with as we begin this partnership together. We have some great plans to activate our relationship that include plenty of initiatives to support the local community.”</p>
<p>Boreham Wood FC is similarly excited at the opportunity to be associated with LV Bet. “In truth, this partnership has already allowed me to hire a new community coach full time, as well as to start planning for a number of schools and community initiatives that will assist local parents and youngsters, so there will be a direct benefit and reinvestment into the community as a consequence,” added club owner Danny Hunter.</p>
<p>Not Everyone Supports Sports Gambling Signage</p>
<p>The partnership comes at a time when the British public is increasingly polarized when it comes to sponsorships between sports teams and gambling companies. As reported in September, there has been a growing momentum against displaying gambling signage on players’ shirts or other parts of their main attire.</p>
<p>There have been numerous similar partnerships between sports teams and gaming companies over the last few months. Parimatch signed three agreements with English Premier League (EPL) clubs last month, adding Aston Villa, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, and Southampton as partners.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the company celebrated its ongoing relationship with Serie A soccer club Juventus. LV Bet is now planning to run its partnership with Boreham Wood FC over the next two years.</p>
