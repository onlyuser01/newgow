    <h1>Casino Matrix 8 Online Casino Canada Hot Springs Casino Prarie Band Casino Ndb Casino Spelinspektion</h1>

<p>The leading iGaming content provider, Spinomenal, announced it secured a new license, allowing it to continue to expand in Europe. Earlier this week, the company confirmed that the Swedish Gambling Authority (SGA), the gambling regulator in the country, awarded the company with a business-to-business (B2B) suppliers permit. The regulator, also known as Spelinspektionen, granted the supplier permit to Spinomenal, effectively allowing the company to continue to supply operators in Sweden with its popular games.</p>
<p>Holding a supplier license is a requirement in light of the upcoming change to the market in Sweden planned for this summer. Once the new rules come into effect, providers of gambling software such as games and technology will be required to have a valid B2B suppliers permit from the Swedish Gambling Authority. Given the recently secured permit from Spinomenal, the company will be able to continue to grow in the region, delivering its content to new operators.</p>
<p>Lior Shvartz, Spinomenal's CEO, shared his excitement about the latest announcement in a statement. "Sweden plays a significant role in our expansion strategy and we’re elated to announce that we have secured our B2B suppliers permit from the SGA," he explained. Finally, Shvartz noted: "This permit showcases our commitment to operating lawfully within leading regulated markets and we look forward to keeping on sharing our games with Sweden's slot players."</p>
<p>Thanks to the new B2B permit, operators in Sweden will be able to enjoy hit games from Spinomenal such as Lucky Jack – Dagger Of Destiny, Book of Rampage and Majestic King, among others. Additionally, players in the country will be able to continue to enjoy popular titles that stand out with great storylines and engaging functionalities.</p>
<p>Recently, other leading iGaming operators and suppliers also secured a license from the gambling regulator in Sweden. Earlier this month, the iGaming technology company, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), confirmed it was awarded a license from Spelinspektionen.</p>
<p>Before that, Booming Games, a popular and fast-growing provider of games for the iGaming vertical, also confirmed it was awarded a license by the regulator. Thanks to the B2B gaming license from Spelinspektionen, the company can continue to deliver its popular content to operator partners, while adhering to the upcoming regulatory changes within the market.</p>
<p>Back in April, Pariplay, the leading aggregation platform and a subsidiary of NeoGames, also secured a supplier license from the Swedish Gambling Authority. Similar to the other providers, the license enabled the company to stay compliant with the upcoming changes to the online gambling framework.</p>
