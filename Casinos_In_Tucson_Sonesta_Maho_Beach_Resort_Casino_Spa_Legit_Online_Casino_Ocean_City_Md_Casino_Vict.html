<p>Wynn Resorts and Genting Settle Copyright Spat Over Resort World Las Vegas Design</p>

<p>Two feuding Las Vegas neighbors have finally agreed to put their differences aside — or should that be similarities? Wynn Resorts and Genting have reached an understanding about the architectural design of the $4 billion Resorts World Las Vegas, which the Malaysian casino giant is currently building across the Strip from the Wynn Las Vegas and its sister property Encore.</p>

<p>Just before Christmas, Wynn Resorts filed suit against its new neighbor, claiming the building slowly taking shape across the street was too similar to its own properties and that this amounted to copyright infringement and a violation of its “architectural trade dress.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit sought a temporary injunction to halt the Resorts World project while the offending elements were removed. These included the concave hotel tower and bronze glass which Wynn claims have become trademarks of Wynn properties.</p>
<p>Change of Plans</p>
<p>Responding to the five-count trademark infringement and unfair competition lawsuit, Genting said halting the installation of the current glass design would cost the project $169 million and result in the dismissal of approximately 500 construction workers.</p>
<p>The company added the property would look “dramatically different” on completion, “dispelling any suggestion that a reasonable consumer could confuse the two resorts for each other.”</p>
<p>The two parties were set to meet in a Las Vegas courtroom Tuesday, where Genting was expected to provide proof to back these claims. But instead, the two parties put their heads together and found a mutually satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>Genting’s senior vice president for public affairs and development, Michael Levoff, said in an official statement that changes would be made to the design of the Resorts World project following negotiations with Wynn Resorts.</p>
<p>On Schedule for 2020</p>
<p>“This mutually beneficial settlement will allow Genting to continue to develop Resorts World Las Vegas with minimal impact to cost and the overall project timeline,” Levoff said in a joint press release issued by both parties.</p>
<p>“The new design changes offered by Genting will resolve the concerns we expressed about the similarity of the design,” added Wynn Resorts Chief Communications Officer Michael Weaver. “We welcome and look forward to Resorts World Las Vegas’ opening. Their future success will benefit all of Las Vegas.”</p>
<p>Resorts World is being built on the site of the historic Stardust Casino, which was demolished by Boyd Gaming in 2007. Boyd planned to build its Echelon Place project on the plot but that was abandoned during the recession.</p>
<p>Resorts World Las Vegas was initially slated to open in 2016 but has been delayed due to several redesigns. It is scheduled to open in 2020.</p>
