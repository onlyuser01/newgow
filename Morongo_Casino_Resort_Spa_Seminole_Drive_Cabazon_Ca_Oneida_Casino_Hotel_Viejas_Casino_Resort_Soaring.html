<p>In March 2021, Betway’s chief executive officer Anthony Werkman announced that the leading provider of first-class entertainment across sports betting, poker, casino, and bingo was handed a sports betting license from the Regional Council in Darmstadt</p>
<p>Now, the brand has announced the extension of the same license. Automatically, Betway will be able to keep providing its top-tier offerings to customers in the country’s regulated market.</p>
<p>Betway Is Proud to Secure a License Extension</p>
<p>CEO Werkman spoke about the license expansion with excitement, explaining that it would further help them offer their “much-loved products to sports betting fans in Germany”. Werkman described the brand’s sponsorship portfolio as an “industry-leading” one that would help them enhance their commitment to supporting the types of sports that domestic customers know and appreciate.</p>
<p>Plus, he added that the gaming market in Germany, which is known for nurturing a safe and responsible gambling environment, will benefit from their leading products thanks to their new German office opened in Düsseldorf and the talented crew there. The company plans to promote its future expansion in the country using enhanced localization for its sportsbook offerings, simplified access options, and a number of new job openings.</p>
<p>The Super Group-owned brand is known for showing its support for a number of high-profile sports in the country. Their impressive portfolio in German soccer features the winner of the 2022 Europa League, Eintracht Frankfurt, together with Hertha Berlin, VfB Stuttgart, Schalke 04, and Werder Bremen.</p>
<p>Tennis is another sport that has harnessed the support of the brand in Germany. Betway is currently Boss Open’s Official Betting Partner, as well as the betting partner of the Hamburg Open and the Terra Wortmann Open. Together, the three tournaments represent three of the four Association of Tennis Professionals tournaments that are held in Germany.</p>
<p>Last May, the sports betting and gaming brand announced it turned into Hamburg European Open’s official sponsor for 2022. The partnership was an expansion of the “fantastic relationship” that the two parts were already enjoying and harnessing since 2021. The event which spread across nine days between July 16 and July 24, 2022, reunited a number of high-profile and promising tennis players.</p>
<p>The list included Danish player Holger Rune, Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, German player Andrea Eprkovic who was the tournament’s ambassador, and Top 10 American player Danielle Collins who made it into the Australian Open final.</p>
