    <h1>Casino Portsmouth Va Sonesta Maho Beach Resort Casino Spa Arctic Monkeys Tranquility Base Hotel Casi</h1>

<p>Software developer Spotlight announced the continuation of its ten-year partnership with casino resort Lake of the Torches. As a result of a new agreement, Spotlight’s premiere software, SpotlightCRM v4, will replace Lake of the Torches’ current system.</p>
<p>Spotlight’s New Solution Provides a Solid Improvement</p>
<p>I.C. Intelligence has operated under the name Spotlight since 2013. The company is based in Las Vegas and Louisiana and primarily focuses on developing, refining, and marketing its signature SpotlightCRM platform to land-based operators.</p>
<p>Jeff Baldi, Spotlight CEO, noted that it was reassuring to see a long-time partner like Lake of the Torches continue to use their software and reasserted the company’s commitment to future success.</p>
<p>V4 represents our future and dedication to driving premier customer experiences through elegant tech. Jeff Baldi, CEO of Spotlight</p>
<p>Spotlight’s customer relationship management system (CRM) offers configurable real-time notifications for engaging with clients and possesses integrated communication capabilities. The newest V4 version of the software provides a better, more streamlined, and customizable interface with expanded AML-related compliance features and native mobile support. The new design aims to improve customer contextual experience and provide a flexible solution for any gaming resort.</p>
<p>The Resort Lauded Spotlight’s Products</p>
<p>Lake of the Torches Resort Casino is managed by the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians. The venue is located on the shores of Pokegama Lake and has 101 rooms, restaurants, a pool area, and an 8,500-square-foot convention center. Guests at the resort can also enjoy blackjack tables and over 800 slot machines.</p>
<p>Lake of the Torches Resort Casino CEO Bill Guelcher expressed his delight to continue the venue’s partnership with Spotlight:</p>
<p>Over the years, we have… consistently achieved our performance goals by integrating Spotlight into our daily business. Bill Guelcher, CEO of Lake of the Torches Resort Casino</p>
<p>Guelcher noted that the two companies had established a solid relationship which he was looking forward to continuing.</p>
<p>Lake of the Torches Continues to Invest in Modern Management Solutions</p>
<p>The resort recently made a similar deal with Table Trac, a casino management system developer. Lake of the Torches purchased the company’s CasinoTrac system, which automates and monitors various aspects of the casino floor. The Table Trac team noted that their solution would improve the player experience, loyalty, and retention. The developer will provide long-term support to fine-tune the software for the casino resort’s specific needs.</p>
<p>Lake of the Torches has consistently ranked among the top casinos in Wisconsin during the two decades it has been in business. The recent software purchases should help the resort keep its casino business viable and up-to-date for the foreseeable future.</p>
