<p>On September 21, IGT launched an appeal, trying to overturn the High Court’s decision and continue its battle against the British regulator</p>
<p>International Game Technology (IGT), a leading supplier of products and solutions to the global casino industry, has discontinued its appeal against the High Court’s decision to stop it from pursuing damages from the UKGC.</p>
<p>For reference, IGT disagreed with the regulator’s decision to select Allwyn as the next National Lottery operator and claimed that Camelot’s loss would induce damages. However, the High Court said on July 28, 2023, that IGT has no legal standing to pursue damages.</p>
<p>On September 21, IGT launched an appeal, trying to overturn the decision and continue its battle against the British regulator. However, the provider has now decided to drop its appeal and, on January 9, 2024, received approval from the Court of Appeal to do just that.</p>
<p>Both IGT and Camelot were unhappy with the UKGC’s decision at first. Camelot, however, gave up earlier and eventually joined forces with its former rival, Allwyn.</p>
<p>IGT added that it will no longer pursue a claim for damages against the UKGC.</p>
<p>The UKGC Believes It Held a Fair Competition</p>
<p>In the meantime, the UKGC said that it “remains resolute” that it has run a fair and robust competition and has granted the fourth National Lottery license to the worthiest operator. The regulator promised that its evaluation process has been carried out fairly and in accordance with the body’s statutory duties.</p>
<p>The UKGC also pointed out that it will prioritize working to implement the decision, saying that this would provide benefits to both the participants and good causes. Right now, the regulator is on track to provide the license on February 1, 2024.</p>
<p>For reference, the National Lottery is among the biggest lotteries in the world. Launched in 1994, the lottery has so far raised over £47 billion for 670,000 good causes across the United Kingdom. Its contributions have supported arts, sports, heritage and communities and have transformed the lives of many people.</p>
<p>The UKGC added that Allwyn is a company that is committed to investing in the National Lottery, allowing it to grow further, innovate its products and raise more money for good causes in Britain. The regulator concluded that it does not intend to make further comments on this matter.</p>
