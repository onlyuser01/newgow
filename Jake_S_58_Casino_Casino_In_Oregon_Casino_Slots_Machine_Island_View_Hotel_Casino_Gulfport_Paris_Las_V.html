<p>The betting handle reported in November 2022 by licensed sports betting operators in New Hampshire increased to $93.1 million, new data reveals</p>
<p>The regulatory body in charge of sports betting, the New Hampshire Lottery, has announced its latest report, outlining that November marked a strong month for retail and mobile sportsbooks in the state.</p>
<p>November Sports Betting Handle Soars</p>
<p>In total, the combined retail and mobile betting handle in November hit $93,090,530. This marked the third month in a row with an increase in the betting handle, considering that a month earlier, in October, it halted at $91.3 million. Moreover, the $93.1 million betting handle reported in November marked the second-best result for 2022, surpassed only by the $99.5 million combined betting handle reported in January 2022.</p>
<p>While the betting handle increase month-over-month in November, gross gaming revenue (GGR) decreased. Back in October 2022, GGR was $9.1 million, marking the best result since the start of the year. Yet, after one month, in November, the GGR plummeted to $4,963,600. This result was close to the $4.5 million and $4.2 million in GGR reported in July and August 2022 but also fell behind the $7.4 million reported in September.</p>
<p>Considering the decrease in GGR, the state collected less tax revenue. The $9.1 million GGR reported in October resulted in $4.5 million in proceeds for New Hampshire. However, in November, the state’s revenue share decreased to $2.2 million, which was lower than in October and September, but higher than the figure from August.</p>
<p>Mobile Betting Handle on the Rise</p>
<p>According to a breakdown provided by the New Hampshire Lottery, the betting handle from mobile sports betting increased in November, hitting $69.1 million, up slightly when compared to the $68.2 million result from October.</p>
<p>GGR from mobile betting in November was $5.4 million and could not surpass the GGR reported a month earlier, in October. The state’s share based on the reported GGR in November was $2.4 million, still behind the results from October and September, but an improvement from the figures from August and July.</p>
<p>On the other hand, retail sports betting has seen $24 million in betting handle in November. This marked an increase when compared month-over-month, but GGR from the activity plummeted to negative $422,119. Despite that, the betting handle from retail sports betting has been continuously growing and in fact, the result from November marked the highest figure for 2022.</p>
<p>Located in the Northeastern US, New Hampshire borders Maine, Massachusetts and Vermont and is the only state that currently offers sports betting. Both Massachusetts and Maine have legalized the activity but are yet to launch their regulated sports betting markets, while Vermont hasn’t even legalized sports wagering yet.</p>
