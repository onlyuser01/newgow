<p>One of the fastest-growing sports companies in North America, PrizePicks, announced Thursday a new partnership with the United States' premier form of motorsports, NASCAR. Under the terms of the new multi-year collaboration, PrizePicks was designated as NASCAR's official Fantasy Sports Partner.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, PrizePicks will benefit from brand exposure and VIP opportunities via multiple events this year while NASCAR is celebrating its 75th season. The deal will kick off with the NASCAR Cup Series Geico 500, set to start Sunday at the Talladega Superspeedway.</p>
<p>The new collaboration with NASCAR marks the first deal with a major US sports league for PrizePicks. However, it follows other collaborations signed earlier this year. The recent tie-up marked the third collaboration for PrizePicks after the company forged deals with Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves, as well as Major League Soccer's Atlanta United recently.</p>
<p>Joe Solosky, NASCAR's managing director, shared his excitement about the partnership in a statement saying: "PrizePicks has consistently shown itself to be a fantasy platform with a loyal fanbase and wide variety of sports offerings." Finally, he explained: "This partnership is an opportunity for both organizations to expand and increase engagement with new and existing fans."</p>
<p>Adam Wexler, PrizePicks' Co-Founder and CEO, was similarly excited about the company's partnership with NASCAR. "We've always taken great pride in the fact that a great deal of our marketing and partnerships remain true to our southern roots," he pointed out. Last but not least, Wexler said: "Working with NASCAR is the best of all worlds, an organization based in the South with a national footprint that is consistently growing on our platform."</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, PrizePicks is expected to increase the popularity of motorsports within its platform. It was back in 2021 when the company introduced its NASCAR fantasy offering. In the last year, the interest in those offers soared by 400%.</p>
<p>The fantasy offering for NASCAR enables fans to challenge each other by predicting Fantasy Scores, Laps Led, and Cars Passed. Additional functionalities allow projections for NASCAR Points, Fastest Laps and Starting Position, delivering engaging opportunities for NASCAR fans.</p>
<p>Only recently, NASCAR forged a deal with Powerball, the popular American lottery. Announced in February, the deal designated Powerball as the Official Lottery Game of NASCAR. That collaboration launched a season-long promotion and delivered exciting new experiences for NASCAR and Powerball fans.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the agreement with PrizePicks will help further expand the fan base of NASCAR. At the same time, NASCAR continuously ranks as one of the first sports on weekend television and in 2023, NASCAR's Digital Platform recorded 65 million visits, representing a solid increase of 7% year-over-year.</p>
