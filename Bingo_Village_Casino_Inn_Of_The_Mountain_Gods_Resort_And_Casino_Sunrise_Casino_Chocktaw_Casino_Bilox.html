<p>Brigid Simmonds has served the BGC since its inception in 2019 and has been instrumental in its development. Having served the body for four years and a half, Simmonds will finally depart, leaving behind an organization that is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>The outgoing chair said that the opportunity to serve the BGC and represent some 110,000 gambling industry workers for almost half a decade has been a privilege. She said that she really enjoyed working with all BGC members to raise standards within the industry, create a culture of safer gaming and build public trust.</p>
<p>Simmonds thanked everyone who has supported her throughout her years as the BGC’s chairman.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the Executive Committee, colleagues, members, charities and stakeholders, who have supported me and worked very hard to deliver all of the achievements of which the BGC is rightly proud. Brigid Simmonds, outgoing chair, Betting and Gaming Council</p>

<p>Michael Dugher, the council’s chief executive officer, paid tribute to Brigid, thanking her for the incredible work she has done for the organization. He highlighted her contribution in launching the organization and bringing together the different sectors. Dugher also praised the outgoing chair’s change program that sought to raise standards on safer gambling.</p>
<p>Brigid is a high-integrity leader who is rightly held in huge regard, not just in the betting and gaming industry, but across so many other industries and sectors, and across the political divide. Michael Dugher, CEO, Betting and Gaming Council</p>
<p>In the meantime, Dugher said that he is looking forward to welcoming a new CEO in the spring and assuming the role of chairman. He promised that he would leverage his new position to continue raising the safer gambling standards in the UK.</p>

<p>For reference, BGC members support over 110,000 jobs, contribute some £7.1 billion to the economy and raise £4.2 billion in taxes to fund vital public services.</p>
