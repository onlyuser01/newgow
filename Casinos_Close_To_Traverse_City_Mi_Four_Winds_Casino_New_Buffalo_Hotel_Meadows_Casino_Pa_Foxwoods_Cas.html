<p>Alexander Volkov to Try and Outbox His Namesake</p>
<p>Alexander Volkov is famously good striking-wise, with 65% of his wins happening by knockout/technical knockout. He also has nine wins by decision, which he got by outboxing his opponents. This guy tends to throw huge volumes of strikes, with his UFC average being 4.88 significant strikes per minute.</p>
<p>Volkov also has three wins by submission, which is not so much of a surprise as he’s a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He also utilizes his BJJ skills to protect himself from getting taken down to the ground. So far, he’s been okay in takedown defense, repelling 71% of his opponents’ attempts.</p>
<p>Still, in most of his losses, he got taken down multiple times. For instance, in the fight with Curtis Blades, which Volkov lost by a unanimous decision, Blades made 14 takedowns. This is something that should worry Volkov a lot ahead of UFC Fight Night 221. Why? Because Alexander Romanov is an excellent wrestler.</p>
<p>Can Alexander Romanov Take Volkov Down?</p>
<p>Volkov has a longer reach than Romanov by five inches and will probably try to keep his Moldovan opponent at a distance. Romanov has never fought such a tall opponent as Romanov who is five inches taller than him.</p>
<p>Outboxing Volkov seems like a mission impossible for Romanov. Instead, his best chance to win the fight is to try and take the fight to the ground. The good news for him is that he definitely has the skillset to do so.</p>
<p>Romanov is a fine wrestler who averages 5.18 takedowns per fight. He even made two TDs in the fight with Marcin Tybura which he ended up losing. Tybura managed to save himself from Romanov’s embrace, but Tybura is better than Volkov in terms of TD defense (79%).</p>
<p>Alexander Volkov vs Alexander Romanov Prediction</p>
<p>We’re certain that Alexander Volkov has spent the last couple of months polishing his takedown defense knowing how good his next opponent is on the floor. If he manages to stay on his feet against Romanov, he’s going to win the fight. We think he can pull it off.</p>
<p>Pick: Alexander Volkov to win</p>
