<p>The one-year scholarship worth $50,000 will be renewed based on funds availability and recipient eligibility</p>
<p>Provider of integrated entertainment, sports content and casino gaming, PENN Entertainment, announced the creation of a military scholarship as part of its ongoing commitment to supporting veterans and military students on active duties.</p>
<p>Support for Military Students</p>
<p>The creation of PENN Entertainment Military Scholarship at Penn State Berks in Berks County where PENN Entertainment is headquartered will be endowed through a multi-year $50,000 commitment aimed at helping student veterans and active-duty military students achieve their educational goals.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, PENN Entertainment’s senior vice president of Public Affairs and chairman of the ESG Committee, Eric Schippers, hailed the partnership with Penn State Berks for the scholarship that will further strengthen the company’s support for the military and its local community.</p>
<p>“PENN is passionate about honoring and empowering our nation’s heroes and this scholarship adds to our overall military recruitment and recognition efforts,” Schippers said.</p>
<p>The new scholarship at Penn State Berks, part of Pennsylvania State University, provided as part of the commitment to helping student veterans and active-duty military students achieve their educational goals in a supportive environment will be awarded for one academic year.</p>
<p>All veterans, active duty, reservists, or National Guard members that are currently enrolled at Penn State Berks can apply for the scholarship. Based on funds availability and the condition that the recipient continues to meet the eligibility criteria of demonstrated financial need, the scholarship could be renewed.</p>
<p>Recognition for Their Services</p>
<p>Todd Migliaccio, interim chancellor at Penn State Berks, outlined the importance of such scholarships for students who need to feel financially secure to achieve their educational goals, as well as a sign of recognition from the local community.</p>
<p>“Opportunities like the PENN Entertainment Military Scholarship are important, not only to financially support our student veterans so they can focus on their academic successes but also to let them know that they are important members of the Penn State Berks campus community,” Migliaccio said.</p>
<p>Philanthropy is crucial to sustaining Penn State University’s tradition of education research and service to communities and around the world, with $2.2 billion raised between 2016 and 2022 under the motto of “A Greater Penn State for 21st Century Excellence.”</p>
<p>Scholarship programs provide equal opportunities for students from every background, supporting a transformative experience throughout their education and empowering them to fulfill their potential later in their careers by becoming leaders and bringing benefits to the world we share.</p>
<p>With 43 properties across 20 states, live online sports wagering in 16 jurisdictions and iCasino in five states, PENN Entertainment established itself as one of the leading gaming operators nationwide.</p>
<p>PENN’s portfolio includes popular brands such as Hollywood Casino, L’Auberge, Barstool Sportsbook, and theScore Bet Sportsbook and Casino.</p>
