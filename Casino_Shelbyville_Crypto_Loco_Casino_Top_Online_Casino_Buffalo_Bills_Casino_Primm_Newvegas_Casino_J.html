<p>Jack Della Maddalena Going for Another Knockout</p>
<p>Jack Della Maddalena started his MMA career in local competitions, before getting a chance to prove himself globally in Dana Whiteâ€™s Contender Series in 2021. He took his chance and earned himself a UFC contract.</p>
<p>A couple of months later, he made his UFC debut, defeating Pete Rodriguez by TKO at UFC 270. He did the same in his next fight (against Ramazan Emeev), as well as in his third UFC fight (vs Danny Roberts). For the TKO wins against Emeev and Roberts, Della Maddalena won the UFC Performance of the Night Bonus.</p>

<p>The three TKO wins in the UFC didnâ€™t come as a surprise to those who are following his career. This guy is famously good striking-wise, with 11 of his 13 career wins happening by either a knockout or technical knockout.</p>
<p>The Australian tends to land a lot of strikes in every fight (8.45 per minute), although theyâ€™re usually not too powerful. Itâ€™s the sheer volume of punches that usually defeats his opponents.</p>
<p>Can Randy Brown Make Use of His Height and Reach at UFC 284?</p>
<p>Randy Brown is four inches taller than Della Maddalena and has a 5-inch longer reach. Itâ€™s not that his Australian foe is short; itâ€™s just that Brown is taller than an average welterweight. And heâ€™s been using this fact to his advantage.</p>
<p>With his long arms and decent boxing skills, Brown has the ability to keep the opponents away from him. This explains why in his previous three UFC fights, he won by decision each time. Heâ€™ll probably try to outbox Della Maddalena as well, although we could see him try and make a takedown or two.</p>
<p>The brown belt in BJJ doesnâ€™t make too many TD attempts (only 0.69 on average), but even that is superior to Della Maddalena whoâ€™s never taken anyone down in the UFC.</p>
<p>Jack Della Maddalena vs Randy Brown Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a boxing match, with both fighters probably trying to make as many significant strikes as possible. We might see Brown also attempt to make a takedown, but we doubt itâ€™s going to result in him winning inside the distance. It could, however, help him win the judgesâ€™ affection and win by points.</p>
<p>Picks: Randy Brown to win by decision</p>
