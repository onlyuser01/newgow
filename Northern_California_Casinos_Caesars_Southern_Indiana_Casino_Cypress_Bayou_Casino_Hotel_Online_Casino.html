<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) has signed a partnership extension to its existing relationship with sports and gaming operator Novibet. As a result, Novibet will continue to use the automated affiliate compliance and screening tool – GiG Comply. This extension represents the trust that both parties put in each other.</p>
<p>GiG Comply is a powerful solution that has made it possible for gaming and betting operators to carefully analyze relevant business opportunities and realize them while remaining complaint with local laws, prerequisites and expectations.</p>
<p>This compliance effort focuses exclusively on advertisement and marketing content that GiG Comply can scan through web pages, follow up on links, and ultimately look for "red flag" words that essentially breach regulatory standards, alerting Novibet, and clients in general, to shortcomings in the marketing offer.</p>
<p>The tool makes it easy to ensure that operators areaware of such breaches and can act quickly to amend instances of such issues. GiG Comply takes snapshots from affiliate campaigns and how each partner brand is used in marketing efforts to ensure that they remain on the right side of gambling regulation.</p>
<p>This partnership signifies much to both partners as well. GiG CMO Jonas Warrer sad that it was a proud moment indeed to see a partner choose to extend an existing collaboration and entrust GiG Comply with protecting the said brand’s name and reputation.</p>
<p>"Extending the partnership shows that our marketing compliance tool reflects Novibet’s commitment to sustainability and responsible gaming," Warrer added.</p>
<p>Novibet International Affiliate Manager George Gerakanakis welcomed the opportunity to be building upon this partnership with Novibet, and said, that it was an important stepping-stone in furthering the company’s ambitions which focus on bringing a fully compliant gaming experience to bear.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership with GiG, Gerakanakis is confident that the company’s standards for any compliance matter were set very high. "With the recent extension of our partnership, the relying GiG Comply tool will continue to support the affiliate compliance team across the regulated markets we operate in," he concluded.</p>
<p>Novibet exited the United Kingdom some five months ago in February, with the UKGC confirming that the company had handed its licenses in. Since then, the company has been working actively to expand its reach in other markets. As to GiG, the company achieved success with Crab Sports in Maryland, United States. GiG Comply remains one of the foremost solutions in ensuring that affiliate partners meet brand needs and standards.</p>
