    <h1>Catawba Two Kings Casino Reviews Bahamas Casino Horseshoe Casino Hammond Hotels With Casinos Near Me</h1>

<p>Have had two terrible experiences with this casino. On August 27/28 2023 I participated in a special Weekly 30 Free Spins bonus.</p>
<p>I won $301.14 CAD that needed to be wager 45 times ($13,551.3)</p>
<p>There are only a few games you can play with bonus funds, which I did. I was very lucky and made my wager requirements 13,560/13,551.3.</p>
<p>I won $14,358.42 CAD. I was congratulated on my win and I was beyond excited!</p>
<p>Then began the withdrawal issues. I first tried to withdraw $1000 CAD with interac. Got rejected because I deposit with crypto and you need to use the same method. Then I tried to withdraw $4000 to crypto, that got rejected because I needed to upload some info for verification. Everything was cool so far, and I followed the rules.</p>
<p>Then I tried to withdraw $2000 after many live chats and emails with the same response "That it takes time, it's in queue and the finance department needs to review and verify" After 72 hrs of back and forth messages they emailed me saying my withdraw has been rejected and my winnings confiscated which was $ 10938.78 CAD (because I gambled a bit while waiting for my withdraw approval). The reason they gave was I have exceeded the maximum withdrawal limit of the special Weekly 30 Free Spins bonus. The max is $200 which is the amount they left in my account and I was able to withdraw quickly.</p>
<p>I was crushed, but what could I do?</p>
<p>I understand rules are rules and I should of been more aware of bonus terms. But in the last week especially the last 72 hrs no one could of told me that. They allowed me to believe I won that amount and I could withdraw it. Also how was the funds available to withdraw if only $200 was allowed/withdrawable. I was also able to bet with the amount.</p>
<p>Despite being very upset that I lost over $10,000 I still stuck around but today is the last draw. I got an email of a non deposit bonus of 50 spins. I thought ok let's try this again, I've read the terms this time.</p>
<p>However the link didn't work and I couldn't activate it. I contacted live chat and they told me the bonus is not available to me because my bonus ratio is quite high in order to receive bonuses. So they can't provide me with anything but I can play with my own money.</p>
<p>When I asked what this means the agent said my bonus balance has been affected as the ratio of bonuses received compared to my total deposit amount has exceeded the limit for further crediting at the moment.</p>
<p>I am done with this casino. I don't know if anything can be done. But I want others to know and be aware of their poor customer service and miscommunication. I do not like the was I was treated.</p>
