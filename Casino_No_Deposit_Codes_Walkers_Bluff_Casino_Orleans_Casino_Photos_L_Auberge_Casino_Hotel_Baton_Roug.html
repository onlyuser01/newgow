<p>The Denver Nuggets are 1-0 against the Minnesota Timberwolves and are favored to win again. One o the main reasons why that is the case is that today’s game is played on their turf</p>
<p>The Nuggets lead the Playoff series 1-0 against the Timberwolves. Their second game is on the program tonight (April 19), and Jokic &amp; Co. need to try and get another win before the series moves from Denver to Minnesota.</p>

<p>The Nuggets Looking for Another Big Win</p>
<p>In the first game of the Timberwolves vs Nuggets Playoff series, the boys from Denver won 109-80. They didn’t score too much, but they (unsurprisingly) did fantastic defensively. That’s actually the lowest number of points they conceded in a game in 2023.</p>
<p>We expect to see them do good in the defense again, but what about their offense? Well, Denver’s best player Nikola Jokic wasn’t too impressive in the first game, scoring just 13 points. He did record double-figures in that game by recording 14 rebounds.</p>
<p>This time, we think he’s going to score way more than before. We might also see his colleague Jamal Murray do great offensively tonight. Of course, only if Minnesota players don’t patch up the holes in their defense.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves Need to Up Their Game ASAP</p>
<p>The boys from Minnesota are famous for being good in their defense, but they didn’t show it too much in the previous game with the Nuggets. Their offense was even worse, which was sort of expected. They’re not very good scoring-wise but people expected them to score 100+ against Denver for a simple reason – the Nuggets usually concede a lot.</p>
<p>If they want to make the Playoff series more interesting, the Timberwolves will have to up their games. The trouble is that the No. 2 game is played in Denver and they’re not good on the road. The evidence of this is that the boys from Minneapolis are 2-5 in their last five away games.</p>
<p>Timberwolves vs Nuggets Prediction</p>
<p>The Nuggets will almost certainly win again, but we should witness a different kind of game to their first one. We expect the visitors to put on a much fiercer fight this evening, but in the offense and defense. That probably won’t work out for them, especially if Denver’s talisman Nikola Jokic gets in a beast mode.</p>
<p>Pick: Denver Nuggets to win &amp; over to hit</p>
