    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tampa Seneca Creek Casino Gambling Casinos Gold Strike Casino Tu</h1>

<p>A month after launching games with BetMexico in LATAM, CT Interactive, a developer of online gambling software, launched its games on Favbet.hr. The deal follows an earlier deal between the supplier and Favbet that saw CT Interactive seal an agreement with the operator’s Romanian brand.</p>
<p>Favbet is an experienced gambling operator with over two decades of experience in the market. Founded in 1999, the brand’s products are currently enjoyed by over 3 million customers.</p>
<p>In addition, for the last five years, the company won a number of awards at various iGaming events and award ceremonies.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal with CT Interactive, Favbet.hr will be able to further grow its offering, providing Croatian players with exciting gaming experiences. The supplier, meanwhile, will reinforce its European presence, following earlier launches in Slovakia with KajotWin, in Montenegro with Sbbet and in Bulgaria with ELITBET.</p>
<p>CT Interactive also expanded in the key Italian market, launching its Hot Luck Jackpot Solution in the country.</p>
<p>Romanian Audiences Adored CT Interactive’s Content</p>
<p>Representatives from the two companies expressed their thoughts on the deal. CT Interactive’s head of business development for the EMEA region, Milena Tsankarska, said that her team is glad to reinforce its existing relationship with Favbet. She is certain that the new deal will be as fruitful as the old one.</p>
<p>We are very proud to strengthen our partnership with Favbet. This deal proves that our previous collaboration has been incredibly rewarding for both parties. Milena Tsankarska, head of business development EMEA, CT Interactive</p>
<p>CT Interactive’s CRM, Kiril Kirilov, also commented on the matter, labeling the Croatia-facing agreement “another successful step” in the supplier’s expansion in the country. He promised that very soon even more exclusive CT Interactive content will be available to Croatian players.</p>
<p>Finally, Anna Amelina, Favbet’s casino manager, praised CT Interactive for the quality of its products and its overall reliability. She said that the provider’s products have resonated with the operator’s Romanian audiences, which is why the deal in Croatia was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>With its commitment to quality, CT Interactive has become a trusted and reliable gaming provider that always manages to surprise us and our customers with new and creative games. CT Interactive’s products have been a hit on our Romanian platform, so it felt natural to deepen our partnership. Anna Amelina, casino manager, Favbet</p>
<p>Last year, Favbet further reinforced its offerings in Romania thanks to a content agreement with BF Games. In addition, the casino operator secured games from 3 Oaks Gaming, further strengthening its product offering in Europe.</p>
