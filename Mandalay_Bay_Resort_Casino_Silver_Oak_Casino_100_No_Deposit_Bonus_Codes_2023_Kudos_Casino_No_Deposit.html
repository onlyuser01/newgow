<p>The Gunners, the moniker of one of the Premier League’s best-known soccer teams, have welcomed Betway as their OfficialGlobal Betting Partner. As such, Arsenal and the established bookmaker will work together to popularize their brands with their respective audiences and strengthen the fan experience through new activations and value-added experiences for soccer aficionados.</p>
<p>The new partnership is designed to significantly improve the experiences for fans and how fans around the world interact with their brand across betting and social media platforms, giving everyone involved a reason to be happy.</p>
<p>The Super Group-owned brand and Arsenal will work together on work and deliver global activations that meet the mark and add value to how soccer fans interact with their favorite team on game days. All of this is carried out while both partners subscribe to the highest responsible gambling practices as well.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity, Betway Group CEO Anthony Werkman said that the entire company was thrilled to be teaming up with Arsenal Global Betting Partner.</p>
<p>"We are excited to work together to deliver great content and experiences for Arsenal’s huge global supporter base and Betway will also be working with the club to ensure the partnership follows industry marketing protocols and important responsible gambling practices."</p>
<p>The partnership will include the circumference branding of the Emirates Stadium, home of Arsenal, which has a capacity of 60,000 people. Betway will in the meantime support both the team and its fans in achieving better engagement and satisfaction from match day experiences, Werkman added.</p>
<p>Understandably, the partnership was welcomed on a similarly strong note by Arsenal Chief Commercial Officer Juliet Slot. Slot welcomed the opportunity to see Betway become the soccer club’s official global betting partner and help strengthen the relationship between the organization and its fans.</p>
<p>"We are excited to work with Betway to bring more experiences for our supporters across the world and promote the importance of responsible gambling," Slot added, emphasizing the importance of responsible play once again. Betway has been actively collaborating with various sports leagues and organizations in a bid to reaffirm its commitment to this segment.</p>
<p>Besides soccer, Betway has recently increased its presence in tennis through a partnership with Andy Roddick, who has become an ambassador for the brand. Betway similarly became an Official Betting Partner for the National Bank Open powered by Rogers in Canada, another high-profile tennis competition.</p>
