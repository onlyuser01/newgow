<p>Unikrn Esports is one of the most innovative betting agencies, offering versatile markets and opportunities to place a bet. The platform runs esports betting markets on a number of games, including CS: GO, LoL, Dota 2, COD: Warzone, PUBG, PUBG Mobile, Halo, StarCraft II, and others.</p>
<p>The platform offers a great variety of promotions, flexible banking methods, crypto deposits, and exclusive, performance-enhancing features such as Connekt and UMode that completely reimagine how you can bet and on whom.</p>
<p>Our Unikrn Esports review goes into some detail to explain how all of this comes together and why we rank Unikrn as our best, most inventive, and worthwhile esports bookmaker.</p>
<p>Unikrn Esports Promotions and Bonuses</p>
<p>Unikrn invites you to have your pick of the litter choosing from three available promotions designed to boost your experience and enjoyment while betting on esports markets. You can pick from cash and crypto promotions or opt into the Unikrn Umode bonuses. For each one, there is some way to boost your bankroll and offer yourself a good way to begin your esports betting journey.</p>
<p>Unikrn First Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>The first bonus is a 300% matched bonus, one of the best bargains you will get at any esports betting site. Unikrn allows you to deposit up to $100 for a total bankroll worth $400 when you start, i.e. the $100 you deposit and the $300 in bonus funds.</p>
<p>The offer is only eligible for new customers who reside in eligible regions. To activate the bonus, you need to deposit at least $10. Unikrn also offers a flexible deadline to complete the bonus within 90 days and also meet the 3x turnover requirement.</p>
<p>UKG Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>UKG or UnikoinGold is the native cryptocurrency developed exclusively for the needs of esports betting at this esports betting agency. Naturally, to encourage esports bettors to give it a shot, Unikrn has come up with a neat bonus system.</p>
<p>You will need to use your UKG crypto wallet to participate, so this promo is intended at punters who are a little more tech-savvy. The bonus offers a 300% matched rate up to 30,000 UKG. You can deposit up to 10,000 UKG as your maximum deposit, and use the 30,000 UKG extra you receive based on the bonus. The wagering requirement is 3x.</p>
<p>Umode: Bet on Yourself</p>
<p>The next type of promotion you may opt into is the Umode initiative. There, you will get a chance to bet on yourself and whether you would be able to meet a certain requirement as part of your video gaming. Players based in the United States can use this solution to legally place an esports bet on themselves.</p>
<p>The way the feature works is, you get a $10 bonus you can now use to bet on yourself. The winning condition is usually not a stretch, as you will be able to choose what specific goal you would want to achieve. It could be a simple objective such as winning a game or scoring a specific amount of points.</p>
<p>There are no obligations here and UMode is a very relaxed solution you can use to bet on yourself while playing League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Dota 2, Fortnite, Halo, and PUBG right now, with the list growing.</p>
<p>Unikrn Esports Markets to Bet On</p>
<p>Unikrn offers an overwhelming and delightful variety of markets you can bet on. The website features some of the biggest variety of esports games, with some 27 titles available. In fact, if you know a game exists and you want to place a bet on it, you can definitely do so at Unikrn Esports.</p>
<p>The platform features titles such as Call of Duty: Warzone, Apex Legends, and Valorant. You will find multiple markets for:</p>
<p>Hearthstone</p>
<p>Fortnite</p>
<p>Rocket League</p>
<p>Starcraft</p>
<p>Mortal Combat</p>
<p>Street Fighter V</p>
<p>PUBG Mobile</p>
<p>World of Warcraft</p>
<p>It goes without saying that you will find all cornerstone esports games here, including Overwatch, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), League of Legends, and Dota 2. Naturally, Unikrn focuses on all available tournaments for the games, including Beyond the</p>
<p>Summit, ONE Esports, Challengers Korea, Legends Champions Korea, StarLeague, and many other familiar events that are a part of the esports world and specific games.</p>
<p>Bettors will have no trouble finding a game, team, or event they want to bet on whether this is upcoming games or games already in progress. In-play is another possible market you can bet on as well.</p>
<p>Unikrn Esports: What Types of Bets Are There?</p>
<p>Unikrn is without a doubt one of the most advanced endemic esports bookies we have had the pleasure to try and enjoy. It’s more than an esports betting agency. It offers features that gamers would appreciate.</p>
<p>In terms of market variety, you will definitely be in no shortage of great options, including outright bets and the number of rounds a game is going to go up to. Each esports game has its own specifics, so you can’t expect to find the same bets for League of Legends as you will for a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) game.</p>
<p>Yet, some similarities remain, and specifically when it comes down to match winners or over/under bets. Some bet archetypes remain the same and you won’t have to worry too much about them. However, specific conditions will be slightly different.</p>
<p>For example, Unikrn runs a variety of Special Markets, which you may have heard spoken of as “Proposition Bets.” Proposition bets have to do with some specific goal in the game and whether the team would achieve it.</p>
<p>Can you guess the Correct Kills or if a Bomb Will Explode? These are just some of the wagers you can put UnikoinGold and FIAT money on. There are also over/under bets on the Total Kills scored by both teams or each team individually.</p>
<p>Yet, this doesn’t exhaust the variables, as the esports book can get much more intuitive and inventive with the creation of special markets. The bigger and more anticipated an event, the bigger pull it would have and therefore, you could see as many as 100 proposition bets available for it.</p>
<p>Unikrn Payments: Free to Choose</p>
<p>Unikrn offers a mixture of banking options that make payments very easy. You will have a number of user-friendly and familiar payment options to expedite any deposit and cashouts, choosing from credit and debit cards such as Visa and MasterCard.</p>
<p>Bettors can also facilitate all transactions by opting for Bitcoin and UnikoinGold, especially if you feel cryptocurrency makes banking easier. Meanwhile, Unikrn Esports allows you to cash out with Rapid, Instant ACH, Neteller, Skrill, eCheck Select, and PayPal.</p>
<p>The best part about UKG is you can win it by completing various objectives as part of the platform. Players can use the Connekt function to link their gaming accounts with Unikrn and start earning rewards. It’s very simple to do, too:</p>
<p>Link Game Play &amp; Earn Win &amp; Use</p>
<p>You can earn UnikoinGold by playing a plethora of mainstream first-person shooter games, MOBAs, and sports simulators. Further to that, you can then use your bounty to enter prize draws and get a shot at winning real in-game items for specific games. The raffles’ items can be worth over a $100, making Unikrn’s system of distributing awards second-to-none.</p>
<p>Unikrn Reddit: What Does the Community Think?</p>
<p>Unikrn has drawn praise from community members on Reddit, with the majority of Redditors agreeing that Unikrn Esports is a genuine platform offering a lot besides betting. The Connekt features have been evoked in conversation as a clever way to earn something extra for gravitating around the Unikrn community, and UMode has been described as legit.</p>
<p>Redditors have given an overall good rating to the platform, although some users have pointed out that further optimization is necessary. One case described a situation where a bettor’s wagers failed to register on the first game and they lost because Unikrn applied the wager to his second game that he or she had no intention of winning.</p>
<p>With this said, it’s good to keep in mind that Unikrn has a few foibles of its own, and sometimes being a little careful pays off. Overall, nobody has accused or brought up Unikrn on charges of any foul play and TrustPilot gives the bookmaker a 4.4/5.0 rating, with over 150 consumer reviews.</p>
<p>Follow Unikrn on Twitter and Social Media</p>
<p>Unikrn is very active on social media and Twitter specifically. With over 22,00 followers, the company has established a good footprint online. The updates have to do with both competitive video gaming as well as innovations Unikrn Esports has introduced itself.</p>
<p>Ranked mode is set to return to Riot's #VALORANT 🔥 pic.twitter.com/MS3m5x6Z33 — Unikrn (@UnikrnCo) June 19, 2020</p>
<p>Unikrn has a number of supported channels of communications gamers turn to, including Reddit, Discord, Stream, Twitch, YouTube, and Instagram. You can DM or address questions to the company via any of these channels, but for anything account-related, you may be best off tapping the services of Unikrn’s professional customer support.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>Unikrn has plenty to offer in the customer support department. As part of our Unikrn Esports review, we made sure to test every option. Live Chat is certainly the quickest and it definitely proves handy if you are in a hurry.</p>
<p>Outside of that, you can email with the typical response time being 15-60 minutes. However, Unikrn does keep official working hours. Presently, Unikrn’s support agents work between 8:00 and 23:00 CET (Central European Time).</p>
<p>Restricted Countries</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Unikrn Esports isn’t allowed to operate as a betting agency in all countries where the website is available. Players can still accumulate loyalty points and tokens, but they won’t be able to stake FIAT or cryptocurrencies for the purposes of esports betting. In this sense, some jurisdictions are more privileged than others.</p>
<p>It’s always best to check with customer support and the website’s T&amp;C’s to catch yourself up on which countries are allowed to support esports betting.</p>
<p>It’s Worth Betting at Unikrn Esports</p>
<p>Unikrn Esports is what we can call an outlier. The website offers a somewhat traditional product in the form of esports betting but then pushes the entire experience in a completely different direction. The accumulation of unique currencies, live streams, a variety of markets, self-betting mode, and the ability to accumulate loyalty points and coins while you play your favorite games are unprecedented, giving Unikrn Esports the high-ground in the esports betting world.</p>
