    <h1>Free Game Casino Casinos Cerca De Mi Orleans Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Hooters Casino Hotel Las Veg</h1>

<p>Hello, I have been trying for quite some time to resolve my significant withdrawal issue with cashwin. Let me preface by saying that when I sign up for a site, I am never, ever interested in bonuses.</p>
<p>In summary, I make a first deposit and then a second, continuing to play. I make sure that the money used in the gaming session was real, not bonus money. I end up with a sum higher than what I deposited and decide to withdraw.</p>
<p>The statement from my profile was as follows:</p>
<p>Real balance €670</p>
<p>Withdrawable balance: €620</p>
<p>Bonus balance: €50</p>
<p>I decided to first withdraw €500 and leave the remaining amount in the account.</p>
<p>The withdrawal process requires me to verify my identity first, so I submit all the documents, proof of residence, and so forth. Everything is standard. When I request a withdrawal, a notification informs me that I must not have active bonuses in the account to do so. I contacted the live chat, and they tell me that to withdraw, I have to cancel the bonus. After several days of waiting, my withdrawal status changes from "pending" to "completed" on Friday 12/01/2024. Today, noticing that it hadn't been credited yet, I decided to contact customer service again for explanations. They told me that they had retained the €450 and left me a "gift" of the same €50 I had deposited. I want to resolve this issue as soon as possible since I did not voluntarily choose to cancel the bonus, and what's more, I never played it but always only used (as I always do) my deposited balance. Browsing this forum, I notice that I am not the only one who has encountered this issue which often seems evident. Before defining it as a "scam" and taking legal action, I am asking for help in this section, hoping that someone with good sense can finally resolve my problem. Thank you!</p>
