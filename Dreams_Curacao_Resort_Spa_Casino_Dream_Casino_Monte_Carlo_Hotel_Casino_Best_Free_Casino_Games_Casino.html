<p>Wanted Wildz review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Wanted Wildz has an ominous Western theme.</p>
<p>Players will ride through a mysterious town and encounter a reanimated skeleton with a bandit’s kerchief and a loaded pistol in his hand. If players want to escape by dawn, they’ll need to help with a gold heist.</p>
<p>This slot is a good find for fans of Wild West narratives, and Día de Muertos aesthetics.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The dramatic Western soundtrack is embellished with drumbeats and the ominous sound of rattlesnake tails. This is echoed in the rattling and clicking of the reels as they spin, adding further tension.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with classic Western objects including leather boots, a sheriff’s star badge, a cowboy hat, and a sack of gold coins.</p>
<p>The most striking symbol is the living skeleton dressed as a bandit with a cowboy hat, kerchief, and bag of loot. His eyes are red as they glare out from the reels, and it's clear that this supernatural being means business.</p>
<p>The skeleton is drawn in a style that brings to mind Día de Muertos, or the Day of the Dead originally celebrated in Mexico.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, players will see a beautifully illustrated sunset and the buildings of an Old Western town. Those with sharp eyes will notice signs on the nearest buildings reading ‘Bank’ and ‘Saloon.’</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a unique, dark interpretation of a classic Western theme.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wanted Wildz is a five reel, three row slot with 20 win lines.</p>
<p>The maximum win for Wanted Wildz is x15,000 players’ total bet.</p>
<p>The gameplay is quick and smooth, ensuring players' attention will be held.</p>
