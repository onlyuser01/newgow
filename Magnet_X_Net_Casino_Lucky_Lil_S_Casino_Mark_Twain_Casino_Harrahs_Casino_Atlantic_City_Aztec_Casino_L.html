<p>November gaming revenues in Nevada continued to decline year over year, the monthly report released by the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) revealed Tuesday, posting $771.16 million generated during the month by casinos statewide. Las Vegas Strip casinos accounted for $349.8 million in revenues, a 32.46% decrease year-over-year.</p>
<p>Decline in Revenues Continued</p>
<p>The November total revenue figure represents a 17.75% decrease from the $937.53 million Nevada casinos posted for the same month in 2019, and a second straight month of decline, but compared to the 19.5% slump of the industry in October, gives hopes that the rate of decrease is slowing down.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year starting July 1, 2020, which represents 5 full months of operations through November 31, 2020, gambling revenues statewide posted 21.64% drop compared to the same period the prior year, while casinos on the Strip sank 36.11% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Strip Decline Weighs on Total</p>
<p>The decrease in revenues for the Strip casinos for November which is by tradition a busy month featuring the 4-day Thanksgiving Day holiday weekend, was due to several factors among which the low footfall due to the 57% slump in airline traffic, as well as the reduced maximum capacity on casino floors to 25% by Gov. Steve Sisolak in an attempt to tackle the resurgence in new daily coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Strip revenues were down across almost all gaming verticals, led by table games influenced by the drop in baccarat, 45.3%, but even excluding the revenue from the game that usually drives total gaming numbers, table game revenues declined by 32.1%. Slot machines generated 29.2% less, while wagering was off 33.4%.</p>
<p>According to NGCB senior research analyst Michael Lawton, since the re-opening of the casinos in June, Strip properties accounted for 87.1% of the decrease, as excluding the Strip, Nevada revenues were down only 7.4%. Casinos were forced to close down mid-March to support statewide efforts to curb the further spread of the coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>Unlike the Strip properties, casinos in downtown Las Vegas posted a modest growth of 1.74%, to $52.99 million, helped by the first full month of operations for the newly-opened Circa Casino Resort which opened doors in the end of October, while casinos on the Boulder Strip posted 18.2% increase to $68.57 million.</p>
<p>The biggest increase was registered from casinos in the Balance of Washoe County, 50.7%, but relatively low in nominal numbers, $7.19 million, as Reno, the biggest nominally-wise, posted 6.2% decrease, to $47.23 million.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Revenues Holding Steady</p>
<p>Sports betting handle posted a single-month record of $61.8 million in November, almost double the amount Nevada sportsbooks collected a year ago, influenced by the all-time record handle from wagers on football, $56 million.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks took $609.6 million in wagers, modestly down compared to last year, as football bets accounted for $502 million, having an extra Sunday and not having to compete with hockey and basketball. 56.4% of all bets placed during November were through mobile wagering.</p>
