    <h1>Red Roof Inn Tampa Fairgrounds Casino North Star Mohican Casino 29 Casino Red Rock Casino Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Gambling industry testing and certification service provider Gaming Laboratories International (GLI) recently bolstered its executive team with a new high-profile appointment. Industry veteran Thorsten Toms will aid the company’s client solutions vertical, leveraging his past regulatory experience.</p>
<p>Toms Combines Technical Skills and Industry Knowledge</p>
<p>Toms should be a valuable addition to the Gaming Laboratories team. He has over a decade of industry experience, previously serving as the director of gaming administration for the Gun Lake Tribal Gaming Commission. In that position, he oversaw licensing, audit, and IT operations and gained a nuanced understanding of the regulatory process.</p>
<p>Another of Toms’ strengths lies in his extensive technical and automation knowledge, honed over nearly 20 years of work on various software projects. He also demonstrated a keen interest in the latest innovations, as showcased by his participation as a panelist during the 2022 GLI Regulators Seminar, discussing the benefits and risks of cryptocurrency and NFTs.</p>
<p>The unique combination of efficiency-focused technical expertise and an inside perspective on developing and conducting compliance audits related to sports betting and iGaming makes Toms a valuable addition to any company in the industry.</p>
<p>GLI Expressed Gratitude to Have Him on Board</p>
<p>GLI senior VP Kevin Mullally lauded Toms’ vast skills, expressing hopes that they would aid the company’s land-based and online offerings.</p>
<p>As a former regulator and longtime IT professional, (Toms’)… extensive industry knowledge and experience as a trainer will augment our talented lineup. Kevin Mullally, senior VP of government relations and general counsel at GLI</p>
<p>Kelly Myers, GLI client solutions team manager, also had only positive remarks for the new hire. She paid particular attention to Toms’ extensive expertise with the tribal regulatory community and stated that the company would leverage his substantial training experience.</p>
<p>He is highly skilled at clearly communicating technical information to a non-technical audience, and we are excited to have him join our diverse and talented team. Kelly Myers, client solutions team manager at GLI</p>
<p>Thanks to Toms’ deep understanding of information technology and passion for system automation, he’ll be able to assist GLI’s worldwide client base and familiarize them with the company’s vast array of services.</p>
<p>This Appointment Is the Latest in a Series of Reshuffles</p>
<p>Toms’ appointment as client solutions executive is the latest in GLI’s recent hiring spree. In June, the testing and certification service provider attracted a duo of seasoned executives to bolster its client-facing operations. Just a month later, the company appointed a new manager of client services for the Asia-Pacific region, signaling a continued focus on improving customer experience.</p>
<p>September marked another high-profile hire, with Elizabeth Dorgan Bermeosolo becoming the new government relations and business development executive for the Spanish region. The spike in new appointments indicates GLI’s desire to cement its position as one of the world’s leading assessment services providers.</p>
