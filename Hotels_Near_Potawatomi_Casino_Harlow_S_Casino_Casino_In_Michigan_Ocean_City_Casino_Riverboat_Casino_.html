<p>Online poker tournaments are full of fun and excitement, but sometimes they can drag on for a bit too long. For players that want a faster tournament experience, PokerStars has a solution with the new Spin &amp; Go Flash format.</p>
<p>Spin &amp; Go Flash tournaments are faster than the average Spin &amp; Go with smaller starting stacks and quicker levels. So, you can vie for amazing jackpots in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>About Spin &amp; Gos</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Spin &amp; Gos, they are fun, fast-paced tournaments that are exclusive to PokerStars. Players join three-seat tables and the tournament rakes place in a hyper-turbo format where levels are three minutes along.</p>
<p>Buy-ins start at a just $1 and go all the way up to $25. The prize pool is randomly drawn, and the first-place payout can be anywhere from two-times to 1000-times your buy-in. Second and third place players also receive 8% to 10% of the prize pool, so players don’t leave the table empty-handed.</p>
<p>How Spin &amp; Go Flash Kicks Things Up a Notch</p>
<p>In the newly introduced Spin &amp; Go Flash tournaments, everything goes much faster. You begin with a smaller stack than in the usual Spin &amp; Go games (300 chips versus 500 chips) and levels are just one-minute long. Everything else is the same, so you’re paying the same rake and getting the same payouts as in the original Spin &amp; Gos.</p>
<p>Take a look at the trailer here:</p>
<p>The is the first new addition to the PokerStars offering since the site added 6+ Hold’em games in July. Also known as short-deck poker, the game is played with a smaller deck of cards. All of the cards between 2 and 5 are removed from the deck. The variation has become incredibly popular at PokerStars, and it’s great to see that the site continues to add new games for players to enjoy.</p>
<p>If you like fast-paced action, you can also play Zoom Poker. This is PokerStars’ fast-fold variant, where you’re moved to a new table every time you fold or win a hand. You can play over 100 hands per hour, which allows you to build your bankroll quicker.</p>
