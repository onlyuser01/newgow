<p>Game 2: Can the 76ers Set the Pace Against Raptors?</p>
<p>When the 76ers faced the Nets in the playoffs, the team lost in their opening game. However, the Sixers quickly rebounded to their A game, managing 4 victories in a row, having used the first game as a litmus test.</p>
<p>The Saturday game, though, was completely dominated by one player alone – Kawhi Leonard, Toronto’s top man who managed to clinch 45 fantastic points in the opening game, completely stealing the thunder from his opponents.</p>
<p>The Raptors’ Pascal Siakam showed a no less brilliant game, contributing 29 points to the overall effort and securing a very comfortable lead for his team, helping push the Raptors to double-digit advantage by the third quarter.</p>

<p>The Sixers Have a Lot to Show For</p>
<p>The Sixers have reasons to be worried, but they also have their own talent to rely on. Both Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons are prominent players able to perform well under pressure. Embiid averages 26 point per game and though Simmons’ results are much lower, at 16 points per game, the pair are a reliable element of the 76ers squad. Here’s the snag, though.</p>

<p>Embiid’s somewhat subdued performance is understandable with the athlete still recovering from a sore knee. Apart from Leonard, the team had to handle Sege Ibaka and Mac Gasol who both focused on locking down Embiid.</p>
<p>Siakam Takes the Spotlight</p>
<p>As if the Sixers didn’t have enough problems already when Siakam showed himself as a worthy side-kick of Leonard, succeeding to score 29 points over the course of the game.</p>
<p>Leonard was strong in a defensive position, too, stopping a handful of attacks himself, resulting in quick counter-attacks finished off by Siakam. The Sixers are a formidable team, but their current overall shape may not be enough to push them through that second game with Raptors.</p>
<p>With the hours counting, we are looking forward Game 2 in the matter of hours.</p>
