    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Candyland Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Nyny Casino Pool Tusc</h1>

<p>Mat<strong><em>* Me</em></strong></p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>The casino keeps delaying my verification by repeatedly refusing the transfer confirmation of the payment to the casino that they asked for. Because I'm not fully verified, I can't withdraw my money. I've been trying to verify myself since March 15, 2023. The documents with ID and invoice are verified, but the transfer confirmation is rejected again and again. Getslots requires the transfer amount, the transfer time, the transaction number, the IBAN and the BIC on the transfer confirmation</p>
<p>are shown , as well as the name of the bank , the full address of the bank and also my full address . All proof of the transfer confirmation that I sent was rejected by Getslots, including a proof of transfer that I had ordered from the bank.</p>
<p>I am at the Bank Comdirect and the time of the transfer, which was made on March 13th, 2023, is not noted, the IBAN and the BIC are not visible on the transfer either, but I sent another document on which the IBAN and BIC together with my name clearly visible , the document has been rejected . It's about 740 euros that I can't pay out because I'm simply not verified, I don't use a bonus and I don't accept any free spins either, although I have a withdrawable balance of 740 euros, I was given a bonus of 50 euros into the account, but I deleted this immediately as soon as I noticed it, I only add it because Getslots' very good reputation is emphasized on their platform. I see Getslots' reputation very differently. However I would like to ask you to help me to verify my account so that I can withdraw my money. If you need any other information</p>
<p>or require evidence , please let me know .</p>
<p>Thank you Ma<strong><em>* Me</em></strong></p>
