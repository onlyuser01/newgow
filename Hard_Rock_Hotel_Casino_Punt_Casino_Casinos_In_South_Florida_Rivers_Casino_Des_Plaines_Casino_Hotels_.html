    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punt Casino Casinos In South Florida Rivers Casino Des Plaines Casino Hotels</h1>

<p>The sports betting and gaming operator appointed three new executives, expanding its talent pools with seasoned industry veterans</p>
<p>Superbet unveiled several new high-level changes to its management core, onboarding Stephen Parry as COO, Andrei Dușu as CBDO, and Glyn Hughes as CFO. These appointments coincide with the promotion of Adam Lamentowicz to VP of Superbet International, extending the operator’s ongoing restructuring efforts. The new talent will be instrumental in Superbet’s continued growth, helping it remain competitive despite challenging market conditions.</p>
<p>The Appointments Represent a Significant Injection of Talent</p>
<p>The most notable of the recent appointments is the addition of former William Hill International CEO Stephen Parry. His appointment as chief operations officer will leverage his two decades of leadership experience, strengthening Superbet’s operational capabilities and optimizing all verticals across its global footprint. Parry’s vast industry knowledge and successful track record make him the perfect fit for such a responsible position.</p>
<p>Andrei Dușu becomes Superbet Group’s chief business development officer (CBDO). His track record includes senior leadership positions at Google and OLX Group and co-founding the automation platform Flawless. His expertise and familiarity with the latest technologies will be instrumental in identifying new growth opportunities, forging strategic partnerships, and driving Superbet’s international expansion plans.</p>
<p>Finally, Superbet chose former IWG CFO and executive VP Glyn Hughes to assume the post of chief financial officer (CFO). His extensive financial acumen and experience across several distinct industries will be crucial in managing the operator’s fiscal operations, enhancing performance, and ensuring robust governance. Hughes’s strategic mindset will support Superbet’s growth trajectory, strengthening its market position.</p>
<p>Internal Achievements Also Received Recognition</p>
<p>Adding to the three new hires, Superbet recognizes and rewards internal talent, as evident in Adam Lamentowicz’s promotion to VP of Superbet International. Lamentowicz has been integral to the company’s success in Poland, contributing to its expansion and delivering exceptional results. His promotion will utilize his skills in the European market, highlighting the company’s commitment to nurturing talent from within.</p>
<p>Such drastic leadership changes continue Superbet’s ongoing restructuring efforts. The company recently appointed two new chairpeople to aid its strategic vision. Superbet CEO Johnny Hartnett noted that the new appointments would provide the operator with crucial capabilities across many sectors and geographies, advancing the company’s ambitions.</p>
<p>“As we embark on the next stage of our growth journey, it is incredibly exciting to add experienced and capable leaders like Stephen, Andrei, and Glyn.” Johnny Hartnett, Superbet CEO</p>
<p>The new appointments mark a milestone in the company’s global expansion strategy. Adding experienced leaders and promoting internal talent reflects Superbet’s dedication to operational excellence, strategic growth, and delivering an unmatched gambling experience to its European clients. The team’s collective expertise and industry knowledge will help the company excel in the evolving landscape of the global sports betting and gaming industry.</p>
