<p>The game features the four horsemen of the apocalypse and sports four different engagement mechanics</p>
<p>Leading gambling operator bet365 announced the launch of a new original game called Apocalypse Riders X. Adding to the operator’s first-class portfolio of casino games, bingo products and sports betting offerings, the new release will engage players with many innovative features.</p>
<p>Designed to revolutionize the market, Apocalypse Riders X incorporates many engagement mechanics. For example, the game uses xBomb, a new licensed mechanic developed by No Limit City. In addition, the game includes familiar mechanics from the same developer, such as xWays, xNudge and xSplit.</p>
<p>As a result, Apocalypse Riders X players can win big with the game’s maximum win being a whopping 20,000x.</p>
<p>As a global powerhouse, bet365 is well-versed in the iGaming sector and knows what players love. The company boasts a customer base of more than 90 million people across multiple jurisdictions, allowing it to see what works and what does not.</p>
<p>Apocalypse Riders X is a game that is designed to appeal to many customer demographics. It will join bet365’s lineup of 150+ exclusives, helping the operator differentiate its content from its competitors.</p>
<p>Bet365 has been working with NoLimit City since 2022 when the two parties first joined forces. Since then, the two companies have worked together on exclusive titles such as Mercenary X, which was released last year and featured the xWays, xNudge and xSplit mechanics.</p>
<p>Four Horsemen Warrant Four Engaging Mechanics</p>
<p>Bet365’s games software production manager, Marie Deane, commented on the new release. She pointed out that the other two licensed titles featuring No Limit City’s proprietary and award-winning mechanics have proven to be a resounding success.</p>
<p>Deane added that her team is “very pleased” to introduce the new game and the brand-new xBomb mechanic.</p>
<p>4 deadly horsemen warrant 4 deadly features which we have balanced in such a way as to offer a feature hit frequency within 4 spins whilst maintaining the potential players would expect of any No Limit City game – a massive 20,000x! Marie Deane, games software production manager, bet365</p>
<p>According to Deane, Apocalypse Riders X is an exclusive game that bet365’s customers are going to truly enjoy.</p>
<p>Bet365’s products are available in 22 different languages, helping it appeal to players all over the world. The company’s global expansion was further reinforced by new deals, such as the agreement with Sandy’s Racing &amp; Gaming in Kentucky and the arrangement with Bragg Gaming in Ontario.</p>
