<p>A 35-year-old poker pro from Atlanta is on top of the poker world. Daniel Weinman won $12.1 million, the biggest prize in World Series of Poker (WSOP) history, and his second bracelet on Monday afternoon. Weinman outlasted a record-breaking field of 10,043 entrants who generated a massive $94 million prize pool for the Horseshoe Las Vegas tournament.</p>

<p>Weinman beat Steven Jones, a 35-year-old real estate broker from Scottsdale, Ariz., in a battle of top pair (J-J-8) vs. top pair with a better kicker (J-J-K). When the ace of hearts hit the river, Weinman turned to his ecstatic rail to celebrate.</p>
<p>Jones still won $6.5 million, his first cash in a $10K event, and an extraordinary showing for an amateur player.</p>
<p>The final table restarted a little more than two hours earlier, with Weinman and Jones facing Las Vegas poker pro Adam Walton. Jones had been in first place with 40% of the chips with Weinman trailing and Walton, who had been the final table chip leader, in command of a short stack that wasn’t all that short. He held 83 big blinds to Jones’ 119.</p>

<p>Aggressive play sent Walton to the rail within an hour of the game’s restart. He finished the day $4 million richer than when he started when his pocket 8s failed to improve against Weinman’s pocket aces. This gave Weinman 74% of the chips in play, a lead he never relinquished to Jones.</p>
<p>With more than $3.7 million in career earnings, Weinman previously won the 2015 WSOP Circuit Cherokee Main Event. His previous best WSOP Main Event finish was 173rd place.</p>
<p>Weinman’s win ends the longest WSOP streak without an American Main Event champion: four years.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, during the first day of final-table play, Jones won a sizable pot from Germany’s Jan-Peter Jachtmann during four-handed play to vault into the lead for a few hands before Walton finally sent Jachtmann to the rail.</p>
<p>That ended the chances of a potential champ from Germany for the third time in the last five years.</p>
