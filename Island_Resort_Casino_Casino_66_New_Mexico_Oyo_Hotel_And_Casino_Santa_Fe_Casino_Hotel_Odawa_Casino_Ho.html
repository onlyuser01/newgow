<p>Problems withdrawing at Leovegas</p>
<p>bruceyellowhead said:</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My names is Bruce and I have been a player at Leovegas for sometime now, I recently won a large amount of money on Sunday night/ Monday morning may 15th/16th; I attempted to withdraw my first increment of 4000$ and was told I have to wait til everything is check (win,account,ect.) before I can start withdrawals, Thursday may 19th,2022 came and I was given the green light to start withdrawals, I did 3 and that was the max for the day and I couldn’t do anymore til the next day. The next day came and I receive an email saying I need to verify again they wanted a bank statement so I sent them that and again I was given green light to go ahead and withdraw again which I did. Again I did 3 withdrawals and reached my limit for the day and the agent Mitko or Mitka said come back tomorrow (Saturday May 21.2022) and we can withdraw the rest for you. I wake up Saturday morning and again they are asking for a variety of things including 10 prepaid disposable Mastercards, that I used which were purchased from my local corner store Circle K</p>
<p>I had previously used these kinds of cards numerous times at leovegas and the first casino I ever played at Jackpot City, And I have never been asked to provide them, I’ve used them many times at leovegas in the past and they have never asked for them so I had no idea of knowing that I would need to save them; and once you use the balance on them they are useless; and then I would just throw them in the garbage, the cards they are asking for are from a few mouths ago and they are all disposable prepaid cards. I feel like they are trying to do everything possible not to honour my win, as they never asked for anything before this but now I actually won something they are trying to make it very difficult for me to withdraw my money. I have done everything they’ve asked up until this point, and this request from them might be what they were finally looking for, so they don’t have to honour my win, Everything they’ve asked for after the fact I was told I can withdraw my win they already had, they already had my I’d my bank statement ect., as I was already verified before this, so I gave them what they asked for even tho they had it already, and now this, they want these cards even tho they most likely know there prepaid cards, because before when I used my bank card that was new, same bank, same card just expirie date was diffent, I had asked my bank for a new bank card so when I used it at leovegas for the first time, immediately they requested that I send it in to them, why wasn’t that done with these prepaid cards as soon as a used them? But now months later they want them, make absolutely no sense and I find it absurd.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can get some advice from other players or some one that’s familiar with this kind of situation, the reason I made a profile here and wrote this is because I had previously seen a comment from someone at Casinomeister, comment on another review telling them that they have a strong relationship with Leovegas and they will reach out the them.</p>
<p>Thanks and I look forward to hearing for advice.</p>
