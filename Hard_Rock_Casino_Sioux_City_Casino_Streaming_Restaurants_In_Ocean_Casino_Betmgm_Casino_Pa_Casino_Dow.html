    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Sioux City Casino Streaming Restaurants In Ocean Casino Betmgm Casino Pa Casino Dow</h1>

<p>So earlier this month I decided I wanted to close my account with casino yabby. Due to being told I could redeem a deposit bonus by one support member then being told the bonus was no longer available after i made my deposit. Also frequent connection issues that happen to much making slots reel spin time different every spin as well as preventing you from being able to stop the reels with any consistency. So contact thier pitboss/supervisor email requesting I have my account closed. A few days later thought to myself I had a monthly cashback reward coming at the end of the month from the couple hundred dollars I had played like most months. As well as free weekend spins due to my via rank. So contact them back and say I have monthly cashback and free spins I would like to claim if they would reactivate my account for me. Why not cashout on a free bonus before closing my account with them and win $50-$100 of my money back right?</p>
<p>They do activate my account but the first weekend I go to redeem my free spins while talking to support I start making my usual comments like gotta pay that child support. Or need some new shoes. This time it was I'm hungry and need some lunch money. Support says I have a gambling problem and closes my account. I explain to then that I was making a statement basically saying come on I want to win. But refuses to listen and saying he is trying to look out for their players well being. But personally think they did not want me to cash in on a free bonus knowing I had no intentions of depositing another cent with them.</p>
