<p>Australian golfer Minjee Lee has become the first woman golf player brand ambassador for the powerful hospitality giant</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands Corp. has hailed the seminal achievement of this partnership and argued that the ambassadorship will demonstrate how sports can play a crucial role in nurturing and developing leadership skills in women.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands Champions Women Golfers</p>
<p>Of course, the partnership is also promoting women’s golf as Las Vegas Sands Corp. hosts such events at its resorts in both Macau and Singapore. Lee will not just be playing golf to carry on the Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s banner, but also have appearances at various company events and helping garner support for communities.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands chairman and CEO Rob Goldstein welcomed the arrival of the new ambassador and said that it was a part of the industry’s very identity to empower young women to help them compete and present them with better opportunities.</p>
<p>Our goal is to showcase Minjee’s success as inspiration for others to aim to their highest potential. As an Australian native of Korean heritage, we’re especially excited to have her visit our Asia-Pacific properties, along with supporting initiatives in the United States. Las Vegas Sands chairman and CEO Rob Goldstein</p>
<p>Lee was similarly pleased to have this opportunity and play her part in supporting women in sports, especially in golf. She acknowledged that the sport has developed significantly over the past years with women’s events gaining more prominence and athletes achieving better results.</p>
<p>“It’s great to have Sands recognize this momentum and step up to be part of our movement,” the golfer said.</p>
<p>Time to Embrace Women’s Golf as Sports Betting Expands</p>
<p>The rise of female golf has opened up opportunities to bet on more events in the golfing world, expanding a brand new avenue for sports fans.</p>
<p>The fact that women athletes are consistently performing well in the sport is also adding to the availability of contests to wager on. Female golf events are now covered by regulated betting markets in the United States and trading desks as worthwhile events to bet on.</p>
<p>This interest in betting markets on female golf is also correlating to higher viewership, better sponsorship deals, and an overall boost to the female golf ecosystem. Apart from this, there is also mini-golf which has been picking up quite a bit of momentum.</p>
