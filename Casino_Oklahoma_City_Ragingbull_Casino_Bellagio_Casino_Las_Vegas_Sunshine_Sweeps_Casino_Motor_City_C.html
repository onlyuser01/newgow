<p>SuperDraft has tapped Game Play Network to create a well-rounded product in the iGaming segment, extending on its existing line of products.</p>
<p>Turning SuperDraft into Industry Leader</p>
<p>Following a successful tie-up with Caesars Entertainment Inc., daily fantasy platform SuperDraft is now teaming up with Game Play Network, Inc. to expand its offer beyond betting contests and add various casino-style games to its existing line of free-to-play sportsbook products.</p>
<p>SuperDraft CEO and founder SuperDraft Steve Wang has welcomed the news, recognizing the potential that this new partnership brings to the platform. In a statement to the press, Wang argued that the tie-up with Game Play Network is an opportunity to “materially advance SuperDraft’s online gaming vision to provide sports fans and iGaming players with engaging and easy-to-understand ways to play and win.”</p>
<p>There is another benefit from teaming up with the iGaming platform, says Wang. His company is now looking to distinguish itself in the US market, targeting each segment with expertise and consumer focus, and the partnership with Game Play Network is another step in this direction, with the ultimate goal being shaping SuperDraft as an industry leader.</p>
<p>Presently, GPN operates with access to 40% of the adult US population and can provide actionable iGaming solutions for real money on the spot. Casino gambling is recognized as the more profitable vertical of the two when compared to sports betting.</p>
<p>Creating a Well-Rounded Product</p>
<p>Game Play Network CEO and co-founder David Marshall welcomed the partnership and said that he was excited to be working with the Caesars family. “It’s exciting to start our new B2B platform with an innovative company like SuperDraft, under the umbrella of one of the best known and largest casino companies in the world,” Marshall added.</p>
<p>Similar to Wang and Marshall’s statement, Caesars sports &amp; online gambling co-president Eric Hession argued that the tie-up would lead to a well-rounded portfolio that encompasses both sports and casino gambling, making it available for everyone.</p>
<p>“By integrating the offerings of these two companies, we can provide more opportunities for players to earn and experience the benefits of Caesars Rewards,” he concluded.</p>
