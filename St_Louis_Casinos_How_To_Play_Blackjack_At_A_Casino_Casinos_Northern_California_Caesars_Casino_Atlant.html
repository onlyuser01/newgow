<p>Global provider of advanced esports wagering products and technology Esports Technologies announced today it had filed a new patent application for its multiplayer battle games.</p>
<p>Enhanced Esports Bettor Engagement</p>
<p>Esports Technologies filed a new patent application covering its multiplayer battle games’ modeling system, which utilizes a modified statistical distribution to model possible outcomes in multiplayer battle games involving players and teams.</p>
<p>Data analytics is a key competitive differentiator for our company. Esports Technologies’ dedicated quantitative analysis team has found what it believes to be a novel way to extract maximum value from the data that is constantly being generated in MOBA games.” Bart Barden, COO, Esports Technologies</p>
<p>The patent application filed by Esports Technologies describes in detail the systems and methods behind the company’s statistical tool used to represent “the exact score distribution of kills in multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs).”</p>
<p>Such discrete probability distribution, when applied to an esports event, significantly enhances the modeling of probabilities within the event, allowing for more precise gaming odds that can contribute to the engagement with esports bettors.</p>
<p>This patent could significantly elevate the state of the art in esports wagering.” Bart Barden, COO, Esports Technologies</p>
<p>Protecting Its IP</p>
<p>The new patent application filing is the latest action undertaken by Esports Technologies to protect its portfolio of intellectual property (IP), following two other patent applications filed in June and August 2021.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the summer, Esports Technologies filed a patent covering its proprietary live streaming technology that allows sports and esports wagering integration across most of the popular streaming platforms, among which are Twitch, YouTube, Hulu, Facebook Gaming and others.</p>
<p>In August, the technology provider filed a provisional patent application to protect artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology that generates odds models applicable to a betting algorithm in esports tournaments and on various stages of tournaments. For that technology, the tech company received industry-wide recognition, having been selected as a finalist in the Tempest Esports Business Awards.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Esports Technologies filed another patent application, this one for its innovative betting exchange system that, according to the company, “would substantially elevate the esports wagering experience for high-volume bettors and traders.”</p>
<p>Founded in Nevada in the fall of 2020 by a group of gamers, sports fans and esports professionals with experience across iGaming and digital marketing businesses, Esports Technologies is looking to define, shape and grow the esports wagering ecosystem, according to the company.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Nevada and with additional personnel located in Dublin, Ireland, the tech company is providing its advanced product, platform and marketing solutions to service providers and end-users.</p>
