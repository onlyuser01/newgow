<p>Dear Ivan,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. From the document you attached to this complaint, it seems that you’ve been accused of some type of fraudulent activity. The casino mentioned these two terms:</p>
<p>"9.7 We have a zero-tolerance policy towards inappropriate play and fraudulent activity. We will have the right to withhold or otherwise decline or reverse any pay-out or winning amount(s) or amend any policy in the event that we suspect you are abusing or attempting to abuse any of the following: (i) bonuses; (ii) palp errors; or (iii) specific policy or rules determined in respect of an existing game or a new game. It is clarified that we may determine that such an abuse has taken place also if your activity in our Online Casino/Sportsbook, by itself, is not abusive, but your activities in other Online Casino/Sportsbooks in addition to our Online Casino/Sportsbook, taken as a whole, constitute such abuse of our bonuses, promotions, policies or rules."</p>
<p>„7.8 you do not otherwise conduct criminal or unlawful activities and/or intend to utilize the Player Account in connection with such activities; you do not use or intend to use or intend to allow any other person to use the Online Casino/Sportsbook or the Player Account for any prohibited or unlawful activity, including but not limited to fraud or money laundering, under any applicable law, including without limitation the laws in your jurisdiction and the laws that apply to us;"</p>
<p>Is this the only explanation from the casino? If there is any other communication between you and the casino, please forward it to kristina.s@casino.guru (or you can post it here).</p>
<p>Also, did you accumulate your winnings by playing with a bonus, or your real money only?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
