    <h1>Mr Beast Casino Twin Arrow Casino Georgia Casino Bok Homa Casino Gsr Casino Casino Adrenaline Player</h1>

<p>I have deposited and played at Adrenaline for a couple of weeks. They recently send me a coupon via email for 75 free spins, which I activated and used. Was able to win roughly 1.5mBTC. The wagering requirements werd around 30x the free spin bonus winnings, so I ended up with around 35mBTC wager requirement. During this time I played several different slots, and won a few jackpots. I looked at my account when I was around about 0.5 mBTC away from being able to cash out. My balance at the time was around 42 mBTC (around $700 usd).</p>
<p>I went back into the games to wager the last of the requirement, and the second I did, my account balance dropped by 40mBTC.</p>
<p>Ok, wtf.</p>
<p>Great, so I'm assuming there is some max withdraw cap. Makes sense, there usually are. However, the max withdraw cap on free spins is .005, or 5mBTC. So the amount they took out was way too high regardless.</p>
<p>The site doesn't allow you to see your balance history, and only logs the last 50 spins.</p>
<p>I tried calling the number, it took me to a recording in a different language that just repeated over and over. Fine, live chat.</p>
<p>Well the link there doesn't work either.</p>
<p>Go figure.</p>
<p>So I figured I would just withdraw the measly 1.7mBTC they left in my account.</p>
<p>Low and behold, the minimum withdraw is over 2.5mBTC.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>Something is definitely not adding up.</p>
