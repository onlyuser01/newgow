    <h1>Vegas Casino Hotels Hotels Near Treasure Island Casino Osage Casino Pawhuska Sycuan Casino And Resor</h1>

<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>We have reviewed the complaint of player Martin121 in detail.</p>
<p>Here are the details of the player's account</p>
<p>1)The player Martin121 2023-05-12 deposited 90000ARS to his game account using a prepaid card.</p>
<p>2) Player Martin121 on 2023-05-12 applied for withdrawal of 77800ARS to skrill wallet.</p>
<p>On 2023-05-12, additional verification of player Martin121 account was initiated based on suspicious activity on the player's account.</p>
<p>The additional verification was initiated according to the rule item:</p>
<p>2.4.1 The finance department may postpone processing a withdrawal request due to additional verification.</p>
<p>2023-05-12 having studied the history of the client's game Risk Department found the following:</p>
<p>According to the regulations of our casino to withdraw funds the client must make x3 of the deposit amount to be able to withdraw funds.</p>
<p>1) All deposits of player Martin121 were wagered in Roulette VIP/Spaceman/ games with maximum betting returns. (All betting actions were made intentionally to make the deposit turnover x3 according to the rules of our casino), with the difference in bets and losses or winnings did not exceed 10-15% of the balance of the client, and more than 95% of customer bets were made exactly this way.</p>
<p>2) Player Martin121 made a deposit with a prepaid card, and withdrawal of funds was requested on the skrill wallet.</p>
<p>We have reasonable evidence to claim a violation of AML policy, which is in gross violation of project regulations.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, the Casino Risk Department has ruled that the player purposefully carried out all actions to launder funds.</p>
<p>According to the rules of our casino:</p>
<ol>
<li>Casino reserves the right to monitor all transactions with a view to prevent money laundering. Furthermore, Casino reserves the right to examine with special attention, and to the extent possible, the background and purpose of any complex or large transactions and any transactions which are particularly likely, by their nature, to be related to money laundering.</li>
</ol>
<p>Betting activity will be monitored for irregular patterns.</p>
<p>2023-05-12 player account Martin121 was closed without the right to open and the balance was canceled due to violations of the rules of our casino, according to paragraph rules:</p>
<p>14.6. In that case, if we should close your account because of collusion, cheating, fraud, money laundering, other criminal activities, or breach of the Terms of Use, which damaged us or any other third party, the balance of Your Account will be non-refundable and deemed to be forfeited.</p>
<p>2023-05-15 An email was sent to the player with detailed information about the reason for closing his account to his email: mer<strong><em>*</em></strong>ro@gmail.com.</p>
<p>As you can see all actions in relation to the player's account were performed strictly within the rules of our casino, which are publicly available and are not hidden from anyone.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p>Smokace Casino Risk Department.</p>
