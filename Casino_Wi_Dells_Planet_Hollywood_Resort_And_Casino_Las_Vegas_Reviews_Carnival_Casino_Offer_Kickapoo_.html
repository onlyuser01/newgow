    <h1>Casino Wi Dells Planet Hollywood Resort And Casino Las Vegas Reviews Carnival Casino Offer Kickapoo</h1>

<p>The micro-share horse racing syndicate is hoping that the addition of an ex-Betfair head of marketing will boost its footprint in Ireland and the United Kingdom</p>
<p>To this end, MyRacehorse has appointed Will De Nardo as its marketing director and global gaming advisor for the region. De Nardo will seek to expand the company’s footprint in the targeted markets and help elevate the brand’s name, translating into long-term success.</p>
<p>MyRacehorse Brings More Marketing Talent to Boost Company Reach</p>
<p>De Nardo is joining the company following a 10-year stint with various Flutter Entertainment brands. He used to work as Betfair Head of Racing, his latest job with his former company and has also held various other positions as part of Sky Betting and Gaming and FOX Bet.</p>
<p>The company allows racing fans to share ownership of racehorses, which is a unique concept that has taken off since it was introduced in the United States in 2019. The rate of ownership is around $55 and the platform has already cultivated a solid customer base in the United States, with more than 50,000 owners sharing 110 racehorses across the United States, the United Kingdom Australia, and Ireland.</p>
<p>MyRacehorse is fully committed to expanding its unique ownership model in the United Kingdom and Ireland moving forward. De Naro welcomed the opportunity to strengthen the company’s efforts to grow on the international scene:</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to be joining MyRacehorse at such an exciting time for the company, as we look replicate the successes of the US and Australian businesses in the UK and Ireland. MyRacehorse marketing director Will De Naro</p>
<p>De Naro said that he was very excited about MyRacehorse and what the company does and confirmed that he would seek to contribute to it actively and help the company grow and reach its ambitious goals. MyRacehorse UK and Ireland managing partner Jules Pittam was similarly pleased to be adding a prominent veteran from the industry.</p>
<p>“He will be influential in enhancing the ownership experience as well as working with new partners as he develops gaming opportunities around the world,” Pittam said.</p>
