    <h1>Empire Casino Yonkers Santa Fe Station Hotel Casino Casinos In Northern California Fremont Casino Ho</h1>

<p>The affiliate business is a greasy pole – you go up, you go down. Gambling.com Group has bucked the trend by establishing itself firmly on an upward trajectory and the latest acquisition of BonusFinder.com, a website that collects and reviews the information of thousands of casinos from all over the world, attests to Group’s unmatched business acumen.</p>
<p>Gambling.com capped its acquisition offer at $67.5 million, comprising of an initial $14 million payment on transaction close and earnout payments in 2022 and 2023. The affiliate expects the deal to reach a total price consideration of $47 million which will constitute 3.5x the projected 2023 revenue of the acquired entity.</p>
<p>All the Answers You Need in One Place</p>
<p>Gambling.com is effectively buying the publisher, NDC Media, which in turn owns BonusFinder, and in doing so, the company brings another important asset under its sprawling umbrella. The acquisition is a match as BonusFinder.com’s product offer coincides with Gambling.com’s business model and complements it.</p>
<p>Speaking of the acquisition, BonusFinder chairman Fintan Costello said that the two entities would operate well within the North American market.</p>
<p>“Gambling.com Group has demonstrated its leadership position within the online sports betting and iGaming industry, and its proprietary technologies and experience will provide BonusFinder with the tools to maximize growth in this exciting new era of North American regulation.” BonusFinder chairman Fintan Costello</p>
<p>Even though Costello mentions North America, the website and built-in tool have become a globally recognized facilitator of matching players with trustworthy casinos. BonusFinder has established itself as an independent authority providing players with an authentic insight into gaming brands.</p>
<p>Two Companies with Great Synergies</p>
<p>BonusFinder is well-positioned in the Canadian market, and Gambling.com is expecting to see the asset yield significant results in the anticipated mass regulation of the iGaming market in the years to follow.</p>
<p>Gambling.com Group CEO Charles Gillespie commented on the partnership and welcomed the opportunities that it revealed:</p>
<p>“Over the past five years, Fintan Costello and his team have developed a professional, industry-leading, performance marketing business with a customer-centric and brand-driven approach.” Gambling.com Group CEO Charles Gillespie</p>
<p>Gillespie confirmed that the asset acquisition would allow the company to scale its presence in the North American gambling market. He touched on the anticipated launch in Canada and welcomed Ontario’s iGaming market opening up for private companies on April 4. At the turn of the year, Gambling.com grew its footprint in North America by acquiring Roto Sports, the operator of RotoWire.com</p>
