    <h1>Prism Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Oroville Casino Golden Dragon Online Casino Orion Stars Casino W</h1>

<p>Dear Elina.</p>
<p>2020-07-28 10:43 the first account was created.</p>
<p>2020-07-28 12:10 the player sent a letter to close his account for a reason:</p>
<p>"I want close my account permanently. I have gambling problem and I play too much."</p>
<p>The player's account was closed 2020-07-28 12:22 as per the request and the letter.</p>
<p>Under rule 7.5 of the Allreels Casino:</p>
<p>7.5 If a player closes his casino account due to "problems with gambling" / "loss of self-control over the game" / "gambling addiction", in this case, the player is prohibited from playing on the sites of the casino partners, which are indicated in the license of this casino.</p>
<p>The player undertakes not to open a new account. The casino is not responsible for opening by you a new account and any losses that you may incur after opening a new account. We reserve the right at any time to close an account that was created on violation of these rules.</p>
<p>Later on 2020-07-28 13:31 a second login was registered to someone else's name but from the same IP address.</p>
<p>Which gave rise to a violation of paragraph 2.6:</p>
<p>2.6. When creating an account, your personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, such as name, email address etc. You're not allowed to create multiple accounts: only 1 account per person. You're not allowed to create an account for any other person, family member, address (mail or IP), email or device. Any other accounts besides your main Allreels account are considered duplicates. The Casino reserves the right to block multiple accounts without notice.</p>
<p>If we decide to delete a duplicate account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>all bonuses, free spins and winnings that you received by using this account will be canceled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Company has the right to confiscate deposits that were made with a duplicate account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the second registration is considered to be duplicative and in violation of Rule 2.6, it was closed without being able to open.</p>
<p>Since a player has violated Rule 7.5 and Rule 2.6, both accounts are blocked without the right to open.</p>
<p>The player is not allowed to play on this casino site and partner sites.</p>
