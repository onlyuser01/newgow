<p>Relax Gaming has announced it has obtained a vendor transactional waiver with the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, marking its debut in the US via BetMGM</p>
<p>The 2010-founded business-to-business iGaming aggregator and provider that specializes in speed-to-market and innovative gaming, Relax Gaming, has obtained a vendor transactional waiver with the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.</p>
<p>The new transactional waiver was obtained under RLX Gaming, which is Relax Gaming’s US brand name.</p>
<p>Marking Its Debut on the US Market</p>
<p>The supplier that launched the revolutionary five-tiered progressive jackpot Dream Drop Jackpots product awarded with GGA’s Product Launch of the Year in February 2023, has finally made its highly-anticipated debut in the US via BetMGM.</p>
<p>The waiver represents an important milestone for the company that can this way cross off New Jersey as the first state on its list of US states for which the company has prepared serious growth plans.</p>
<p>The partnership agreement inked with the iGaming and sports betting operator is also considered a “landmark deal” that will make RLX Gaming’s premium in-house content accessible to BetMGM customers.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s state-of-the-art online casino hosts more than 1,500 games, making the brand one of the largest state-by-state exclusive jackpot networks.</p>
<p>The list of available titles soon to go live thanks to the new partnership will include iconic games like Epic Joker and The Great Pigsby.</p>
<p>Thanks to the RLX Gaming launch in the Garden State, the brand further proves its continuous efforts to see its ambitious growth plans all across North America come to life.</p>
<p>The New Jersey debut follows the “remarkable success” of Relax Gaming’s debut in Ontario.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s and now also RLX Gaming’s chief executive officer, Simon Hammon, described the New Jersey launch as a landmark moment and also as “one of the biggest” launches in a regulated market to date.</p>
<p>Hammon also praised BetMGM’s ethos which is fully compatible with their own vision.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company’s chief regulatory officer, Alexia Smilovic Ronde, further explained that both the acquisition of the new transactional waiver and the debut in New Jersey represent “just the beginning” of their endeavors to grow in US-regulated markets.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s vice president of gaming products and content, Oliver Bartlett, took the opportunity to welcome Relax Gaming/RLX Gaming into the US iGaming market while expressing their delight to become the first operator to attract “their diverse and engaging portfolio of games to our award-winning online casino.”</p>
<p>In September, Relax Gaming and Livespins announced an important distribution deal, followed by the October news of a partnership with the innovator and disruptor of the iGaming vertical, Stakelogic.</p>
