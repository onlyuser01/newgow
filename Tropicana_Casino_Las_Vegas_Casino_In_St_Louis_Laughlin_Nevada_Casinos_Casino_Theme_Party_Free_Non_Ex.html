    <h1>Tropicana Casino Las Vegas Casino In St Louis Laughlin Nevada Casinos Casino Theme Party Free Non Ex</h1>

<p>i got it , they just robbed my money. its day robbery, just feeling bad to people who will be new victims who will put hard earned money and once they win it will all be gone as they stop responding through all means and we are left nowhere to go and ask anyone, bcoz they just don't care .</p>
<p>please show me only one bet which covers only outside bet of atleast 24 numbers. Any outside bet spread combination maximum i added was 12 numbers in outside bet and 12 inside bet for few times, i was never 24 outside combination. and if i had won outside bet which is 1 to 1 there is no choice i could make any profit . i won 100x and 500x bets bcoz they were inside bets.</p>
<p>fun here is not just ""all winnings and bonuses associated with the gameplay will be deemed void"" they even rob the money you deposited and make it zero lol.</p>
<p>Any outside bet spread combination on Roulette games that cover 24 or more (64%) of the 37 unique number spots on the table is strictly prohibited. For example, betting on both Red and Black, which covers 36 of the 37 possible outcomes, falls under this category. In the event that a player engages in such a prohibited combination, all winnings and bonuses associated with the gameplay will be deemed void, and the player may be subject to account suspension or closure.</p>
<p>not responding to mail and customer care or even so called telegram or whatsapp links show there commitment to fair betting,</p>
<p>now they came up with newly added rules of 7.4. Restricted activities. its presently added and if they want to say it was there earlier then why was it not mentioned even once in so called one mail response i got for my 10 or more mails sent, and why not in customer care chats .so if they want us to believe this rules was there the time i played why is it not mentioned in mail or customer care chats??? why was only rules 14.10.2.4 mentioned???</p>
<p>the so said mail i received once mentioned rules 14.10.2.4 and now they avoid talking about it bcoz that rules are for promotion and bonus so they want to skip that,</p>
<p>this was exactly as i expected from bettilt .</p>
