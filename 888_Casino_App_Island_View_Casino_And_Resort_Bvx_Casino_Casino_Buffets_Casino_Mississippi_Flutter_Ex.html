<p>Flutter Entertainment has confirmed that it would continue to work with OpenBet to maintain and scale up operations in Australia through the former’s Sportsbet brand. The new partnership extends through the end of 2025 and enjoys support from both companies.</p>
<p>As a result, Sportsbet will continue to use OpenBet’s industry-leading tech and services that guarantee a high level of sports betting entertainment for consumers in the country. Flutter Entertainment’s trade update revealed that the company did well in the third quarter, and not least through its Sportsbet brand.</p>
<p>Flutter similarly expects an increase in operations this quarter owing to a jump in cricket betting handle, with Australia driving a lot of this revenue. Cricket results are already beating previous ones on record.</p>
<p>Sportsbet Stands out as Trusted Name in Australia’s Betting Game</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sportsbet continues to deliver an outstanding experience and is a leading sports betting agency in the Australian online market. An estimated 18 Australian brands have gone online in a bid to leverage new verticals of betting as the pandemic has descended on the country as the rest of the world.</p>
<p>To cope with the influx of betting customers, Sportsbet and Flutter have found OpenBet to be a vital partner. Commenting on this partnership extension, OpenBet CEO Jordan Levin argued that the company was happy to be joining Sportsbet for another four years and help provide bettors with a safe, responsible, and immersive experience:</p>
<p>“This renewed partnership with Flutter Entertainment once again demonstrates how OpenBet is at the heart of driving sports betting entertainment to the world’s biggest brands.” OpenBet CEO Jordan Levin</p>
<p>The OpenBet’s platform was previously owned by Scientific Games, but was later acquired by Endeavor Holdings in September for €1.05 billion ($1.2 billion). OpenBet will get more exposure to the US betting market through Endeavor Holdings, which has already detailed plans to use the product as part of its sports portfolio with IPs such as the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and IMG.</p>
