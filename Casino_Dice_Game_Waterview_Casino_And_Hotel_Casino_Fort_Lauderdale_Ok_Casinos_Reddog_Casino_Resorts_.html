    <h1>Casino Dice Game Waterview Casino And Hotel Casino Fort Lauderdale Ok Casinos Reddog Casino Resorts</h1>

<p>In a bid to address the issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, Resorts World Las Vegas is set to unveil a cashless wagering ecosystem when the casino opens on June 24. Customers will be able to play table games, slots and dine at the resort without using cash or credit cards. The 4-billion dollar casino is tipped to be the most technologically advanced casino on the famous Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Malaysian-based developer Genting Berhad has partnered with local software developer Sightline Payments+ to create an end-to-end cashless infrastructure that will be deployed throughout the entire resort.</p>
<p>Cashless Upgrades tipped to create next-generation Casino</p>
<p>As online casinos and sportsbooks embrace digital payment solutions, the leadership team at Resorts World has taken a bold step to create a new customer experience. Senior Vice President of Casino Operations, Rick Hutchins, believes that customers won’t miss getting their hands on good old-fashioned physical moolah.</p>
<p>“Our vision at Resorts World Las Vegas has always been to provide first-of-its-kind experiences across every element of the resort, including gaming. Through our partnerships with best-in-class gaming technology partners, we will offer our guests a fully integrated experience, not just on the gaming floor, but across the entire resort,” Hutchins said. This comes at a time when Resorts World has been adding to its workforce extensively.</p>
<p>Mobile App Integration a Way of the Future for Land-based Casinos</p>
<p>As online casinos and sportsbooks move towards the acceptance of bitcoin payments, Resorts World executives believe that this will successfully translate across to physical properties. Sightline Payments overcame several hurdles in the initial installation of the cashless system. The company received approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 2020 for the use of the cashless wagering system.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 Pandemic Brins about acceptance of digital payments</p>
<p>The shift towards the acceptance of digital payments has been accelerated by the pandemic in the US market. Sightline senior executive Jonathan Michaels believes this will bode well for the revolutionary system at Resorts World.</p>
<p>“Over the course of the pandemic, you saw a huge rise in contactless payments and less use of cash,” Michaels says. “I don’t think those trends are going to reverse. People realize how easy digital payments are to use. Certainly, younger demographics will grasp this more easily, but I believe that across the board, people are going to embrace this technology.”</p>
<p>Resorts World casino will feature 117 table games, 30 poker tables, and 1,400 slots, all connected via the cashless payments system in the casino. Cashless payments have already been rolling out at other casinos around Las Vegas and beyond.</p>
