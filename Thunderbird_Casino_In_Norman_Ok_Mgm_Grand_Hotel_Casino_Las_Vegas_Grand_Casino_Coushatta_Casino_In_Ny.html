    <h1>Thunderbird Casino In Norman Ok Mgm Grand Hotel Casino Las Vegas Grand Casino Coushatta Casino In Ny</h1>

<p>Canadian gaming content and technology provider Bragg Gaming announced that it has signed a licensing agreement with the provider of slot games for land-based casinos Sega Sammy Creation (SSC).</p>
<p>Content-Led Expansion Strategy</p>
<p>The licensing agreement with SSC will see Bragg Gaming gain exclusive rights to distribute select titles from the slot game supplier’s portfolio to iGaming operators in the US, UK and other global markets and continue delivering on the company’s content-led expansion strategy.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming’s group director of Content Doug Fallon outlined the agreement as part of Bragg’s efforts to expand its game portfolio comprising game titles developed in-house and by third-party studio partners and affirm its position as a “growing, content-led business-to-business provider of iGaming solutions to operators in regulated markets.”</p>
<p>“This new licensing partnership with SSC brings to our content library an established, well-known brand that we believe will resonate with players in North America and across our global platform,” he continued, announcing that the company would first introduce SSC titles to players in the US and UK next year before proceeding to make this new content available in additional global markets.</p>
<p>Recognized Slot and Video Games Provider</p>
<p>A unit of Japanese holding company SEGA SAMMY Group, popular with its pachislot and pachinko machines businesses and its SEGA-branded video game entertainment systems, arcade games, and content, SSC is a globally recognized game provider that is well recognized across North American gaming markets and the addition of its content to Bragg Gaming’s platform will further strengthen Bragg’s position in North America.</p>
<p>Chairman and chief executive officer of SSC Scott Winzeler expressed the excitement of the company “to partner with Bragg and be able to bring its “proven land-based content to a broader audience of iGaming players over the coming years,” convinced that the “strength of Bragg’s RGS platform and their diverse array of well-known operator partners” provide an opportunity for SSC to reach players anywhere in the world and offer them SSC’s “strongest content.”</p>
<p>The agreement terms provide for the licensing of select SSC titles which will be adapted for markets in North America, Europe and other regulated online gaming jurisdictions and will become part of the “powered by Bragg” library of exclusive slot titles, among other content provided by Bragg’s partner studios.</p>
<p>Last month, Nasdaq-listed Bragg Gaming announced that the acquisition of Wild Streak Gaming and Spin Games and the consolidation of the companies together with Oryx Gaming under a single Bragg brand completed, facilitating the group’s product rollout in North American markets under the group’s banner.</p>
