<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>Vegas Casino Online is a dedicated gaming operator licensed and operated in both Panama and the United Kingdom. The website offers a dedicated online casino experience for US players, a decent overall gaming variety, free spins, and all sorts of real money bonuses for you to enjoy.</p>
<p>In my Vegas Casino Online review, I will take a look at the company behind the brand, customer support, banking, promotions, and games, among other things. I will help you find out more about the variety of bonuses as well as give you a detailed breakdown of the available payment methods.</p>
<p>Now, I have reviewed Vegas Online Casino thoroughly to help you make up your own mind whether it’s worth playing at this casino. I believe there are several very good reasons to pick this casino.</p>
<p>Then again, I recommend that you stick with the review and decide for yourself.</p>
<p>Vegas Casino Online Owner and Company Information</p>
<p>The company behind the brand is none other than Main Street Vegas Group. They have been operating casino brands since 1999 cementing their presence in the online gaming industry. The company also operates Las Vegas USA, another popular online casino brand.</p>
<p>Vegas Casino Online has been online for two decades now and it provides fantastic promotions as well as the opportunity to bank with cryptocurrencies. The same applies to all brands owned and operated by Main Street Vegas Group.</p>
<p>Vegas Casino Online Welcome Bonus &amp; Promotions</p>
<p>Claiming a bonus at Vegas Casino Online is simple enough. The casino has a large selection of bonuses that may alternate based on the day of the week. Players will have access to the entire selection of brilliant bonuses geared towards all budgets and preferences.</p>
<p>There are several new players’ promotions to start with. I have sampled all of them, offering you a quick peek behind the curtain and what to expect from each promo.</p>
<p>400% Bonus up to $10,000</p>
<p>The massive 400% bonus allows you to top up your bankroll to $10,000 in cash. The bonus applies to online slots, scratchcards, and keno only but is definitely worth picking up. To trigger the bonus, you will need to use the promo code 400BONUS.</p>
<p>150% Bonus up to $3,000</p>
<p>If gaming comfort is what you are looking for, Vegas Casino Online is the right casino for you. The 150% bonus will top up your bankroll up to $3,000 and be available on a range of games, including slots, video poker, and more.</p>
<p>I personally find this promotion to be very handy as it allows me to alternate between games I enjoy and some that require more skill than others. The bonus needs a promotional code to work, i.e. IDBVEGAS. New players can claim the bonus once at any time.</p>
<p>To roll over this bonus, you will need to meet a 40x wagering requirement applicable to both your deposit and bonus. Now, this is a little steep, I admit. You should generally have no trouble rolling over your bonus in the specified time window, though.</p>
<p>200% Double Match up to $7,000</p>
<p>Another massive bonus is the 200% double match you can scoop up to the tune of $7,000. The bonus is applicable to a whole range of games, including slots, scratchcards, and keno. To trigger the promotion, just punch in the dedicated promotional code, SLOTS200.</p>
<p>Daily Vegas Casino Online Real Money Promotions</p>
<p>Each day of the week can be a cause of celebration. The casino packs its offer with a whole lot of worthwhile bonus offers to choose from.</p>
<p>Players are welcome to come and have their pick of the litter, choosing from excellent daily bonuses. The promotions run from Monday to Sunday, and you can have any promotion you feel would fit your strategy, including:</p>
<p>Double Match Up Monday for a $200 match bonus</p>
<p>Cashback Monday for up to $500 without playthrough requirements</p>
<p>Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays: T-Blend for extra chips, free spins, and new games</p>
<p>Wild Wednesday for a 300% match bonus</p>
<p>Triple Weekend Winner for a 250% match bonus</p>
<p>Vegas Casino Online free spins are part of some of the daily bonuses, which will make your experience all the more worthwhile.</p>
<p>Even More Bonuses by Vegas Online Casino</p>
<p>One thing I found particularly exciting about this casino is the sheer volume of bonuses. There are dozens upon dozens of great offers. Presently, the casino runs a dozen or so great promos:</p>
<p>Birthday Bonuses</p>
<p>Monthly Bonuses</p>
<p>Season Bonuses</p>
<p>Anniversary Bonuses</p>
<p>$1,000 Weekly Reward</p>
<p>Refer-a-Friend Promotion</p>
<p>Loyalty Program</p>
<p>All of these deposits are great and they will allow you to grow within the casino’s hierarchy and share great moments. The Refer-a-Friend bonus will grant you $20 for every friend you refer successfully and who deposits at least $50.</p>
<p>The weekly $1,000 reward is dished out in 10 separate installments worth $100 each throughout the week. If you decide to stick around, you will find the Loyalty Program quite useful, too.</p>
<p>You will receive points for each wager you place. In my estimates, you need to wager between $8 and $15, and the amount may range based on the game. Accumulating loyalty points will determine your ‘Player Class’ status as well as allow you to redeem every 100 points back for $1 in cashback.</p>
<p>You will find various other promotions, including tournaments and even the occasional Vegas Casino Online no deposit bonus. I recommend keeping yourself appraised by visiting the promo section regularly.</p>
<p>Payment Methods: How to Bank at Vegas Casino Online</p>
<p>The banking methods at Vegas Casino Online are intuitive and allow players to deposit and withdraw from the casino fairly easily. Now, I will have to warn you that for the quickest service, you will need to use Bitcoin.</p>
<p>All other payment methods work just fine, but they may take a little longer than Bitcoin transfers, which is up to 48 hours at the outside. Other payment methods include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Bitcoin, Check via Mail, Check via Courier, and ACH Direct Deposit.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>To deposit, you will have to pick from one of several payment options. You generally have Bitcoin and credit and debit cards for these transactions.</p>
<p>Visa, MasterCard, Maestro – $20/$5,000.00 (no fees)</p>
<p>Bitcoin – $5/$500 (no fees)</p>
<p>All deposit methods are intuitive, quick, have great limits, and don’t ask for any fees. Keep in mind that once you place a deposit, Vegas Casino Online’s customer support will reach out to verify your identity. This is part of the AML and KYC checks that the casino has to carry out.</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>Withdrawals at Vegas Online Casino are once again flexible and quick. Players will be able to pick from a number of payment methods and request a quick transaction time. Players can withdraw using the following payment methods:</p>
<p>Check via Mail – $150.00/$399.99 (free)</p>
<p>Check via Courier – $400.00/$2,500.00 (free)</p>
<p>ACH Direct Deposit – $150.00/$1,250.00 (free)</p>
<p>Bitcoin – $150.00/$5,000.00 (free)</p>
<p>All withdrawals are flexible enough to provide you with the necessary comfort you expect. ACH Direct Deposit is only available for US players and US banks only. Bitcoin withdrawals take around 48 hours. There are some withdrawal limits per week based on the status of the player, too. They are allocated as follows:</p>
<p>Player Class Weekly Max Regular $2,000 Silver $3,000 Gold $4,000 Platinum $5,000 Diamond $5,000</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all pending withdrawals will be quickly vetted by the casino before being sent out from the website to your method of choice for receiving the funds. Another thing I noted was that unless you roll your deposit money five times, you will be subject to withdrawal fees.</p>
<p>Enjoy Great Games by Vegas Casino Online</p>
<p>Now, to the good part! Vegas Casino Online has lots and lots of games to offer you across multiple categories, including video poker, table games, specialty games, and naturally slots. There are over 250 fantastic games developed by Real Time Gaming (RTG).</p>
<p>True, the company doesn’t necessarily have the most glamorous graphics, but RTG is committed to a special brand of casino games that have their own signature style and memorable gameplay. Overall, the titles you will find at the casino are most certainly worth your attention.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest selection of titles you will find at Vegas Casino Online. Powered by RTG, there are close to 150 slot games you will want to try. We have collected the names of all available titles in alphabetical order for your convenience.</p>
<p>Achilles Haunted Opera Prince of Sherwood Aladdin’s Wishes Hen House Rain Dance Aztec’s Millions Hidden Riches Realm of Riches Aztec’s Treasure High Fashion Red Sands Aztecs Treasure Hockey Hero Return of the Rudolph Basketbull Honey to the Bee Roberta’s Castle Big Bopper Haunted Opera Ronin Big Shot Hen House Rushmore Riches Boy King’s Treasure Incan Goddess Samba Sunset Bubble Bubble It’s a Mystery!

Wok And Roll Hairway to Heaven Penguin Power Wooden Boy Happy Golden Ox of Happiness Polar Explorer Year of Fortune</p>
<p>The slot portfolio is filled with various cool games. Real Time Gaming has developed a number of new titles you can try yourself, such as Cash Bandits 3, Magic Mushrooms, Diamond Fiesta, Vegas Lux, 5 Wishes, Storm Lords, Mermaid’s Pearls, Fish Catch, Trigger Happy, Banana Jones, Ancient Gods, Stardust, Scuba Diving, and so many other great games.</p>
<p>The list of games is definitely impressive. We strongly recommend checking out Megasaur and Aztec’s Millions, as they are the RTG’s network progressive jackpot games and absolutely worth having a look at!</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>Vegas Slots Casino has a bunch of cool games to offer you when it comes to the table games segment. You will be able to pick from casino classics such as baccarat, blackjack, and various versions of roulette and hold’em poker. We have put together a full list of the games you can expect to find here as well.</p>
<p>Baccarat Match Play 21 Blackjack Pai Gow Poker Blackjack Perfect Pairs Pontoon Caribbean Draw Poker Red Dog Caribbean Hold’em Roulette Caribbean Stud Poker Super 21 Craps Texas Hold’em Bonus Poker European Blackjack Tri Card Poker European Roulette Vegas Three Card Rummy Face up 21 War Let’em Ride</p>
<p>Players will get to enjoy all sorts of awesome table games as mentioned. You will get to play European Roulette, which offers one of the best house edges, but also experience some unique card games, such as Super 21, Roulette, Red Dog, Pontoon, Pai Gow Poker, and even good old War. Speaking of card games, we strongly recommend trying Vegas Slots’ video poker portfolio.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Video poker is one of the most generous types of games out there. The theoretical return can easily exceed 100% and the game is loosely interpreted as a skill-based game, although luck plays a big role once again.</p>
<p>7 Stud Poker Double Bonus Poker Joker Poker Aces and Eights Double Double Bonus Poker Loose Deuces All American Poker Double Double Jackpot Poker Mistery Bonus Poker Bonus Deuces Wild Double Jackpot Poker Pick’em poker Bonus Poker European Slot Poker Seven Wild Deuces Wild Jacks or Better</p>
<p>Almost all of these games’ basic theoretical return exceeds 99.54%. The one that usually has the poorest return, i.e. Bonus Poker Deluxe (97.59%) is not featured by Vegas Online Casino. Overall, the video poker selection is great.</p>
<p>You can benefit from a bonus and play a game that arguably requires a little more skill than most slots to produce better results.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>Contact email : [email protected]</p>
<p>: Contact number : n/a</p>
<p>: n/a Live chat: 24/70</p>
<p>Customer support is available to everyone who needs help at Vegas Casino Online. Players have to contact customer support to verify their accounts. You can get in touch via email at any time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a live chat window. The service is available 24/7 and you can speak to a support agent. It will take you only 30 seconds to connect. Customer support works equally well on both the instant and download casino. There is no contact number, but the other methods would work just fine.</p>
<p>Mobile Casino</p>
<p>Thanks to its dedicated instant play platform, Vegas Online Casino is quite easy to access remotely on any type of handheld device. There is no specific Vegas Casino Online app that you need to download and install.</p>
<p>Instead, you get to play directly in your mobile browser and enjoy yourself on the go. Most games will work well, courtesy of Real Time Gaming (RTG). Some, though, may require Flash to run and they could be difficult to launch on an iOS device.</p>
<p>It’s not ideal, but the casino’s gaming offer is getting better by the week. However, keep in mind that around 150 of the games are available for mobile and work just fine with any operating system.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you will have access to every single feature the casino has to offer, making it possible for you to enjoy quick banking, promotions, and more.</p>
<p>Who Makes Sure You Are Safe</p>
<p>Right, so the company behind the casino has already hosted a number of successful projects so far. Main Street Affiliates host four of the most popular casino projects, including Las Vegas USA, Slots Plus, Sun Palace, and Old Havana.</p>
<p>Of course, this shouldn’t be your criteria for determining if a casino can be trusted. Instead, I dug a little deeper and found several reasons to stick with the casino. First, these guys have an SSL encryption, which means that your private data will always be safe.</p>
<p>Secondly, the CDS certification helps to ensure that the Random Number Generator (RNG) produces verifiable outcomes. Now, I understand why most players at VegasCasinoOnline.eu would want to see the hallmark of a distinguished regulator at the bottom of the casino’s website.</p>
<p>However, it’s just not the market the casino operates in. They certainly can improve things by securing a license, but my first wish would be to see an upgraded user interface.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Vegas Casino Online has managed to deliver across the board, providing you with a range of games, banking options, and a great selection of promotions. The casino can use a quick lift up to make the user interface more appealing, but outside of that, the casino has a decent offer that you will want to explore.</p>
<p>Overall, there are some flaws in the design, but when you put the offer together you will find a casino that is ready to cater to your every gaming desire. To me personally, Vegas Casino Online is definitely one of the best Real Time Gaming casinos and I enjoyed playing there a whole lot.</p>
<p>Sure, the looks are a little dated, but the casino makes up for that generously by introducing over 20 viable promotions you can claim on different occasions.</p>
