<p>Croatia is quickly shaping up as an important market for suppliers looking to break into Europe and shift their reach toward the east part of the continent. As such, the country is suitable for established companies who wish to push their products in a vibrant market that is picking up steam.</p>
<p>This is precisely what BF Games, an established and dynamic studio, is doing through a new partnership with Arena Casino, a local brand. The alliance is building upon a similar tie-up with PSK, a brand owned by Fortuna Entertainment Group in Croatia.</p>
<p>BF Games, which is known for a number of prominent titles, including the upcoming Sweet Reward, has developed a number of outstanding games, including Cave of Xmas, Stunning Cash, Lucky Ticket 81, and many others across dozens of game mechanics and themes.</p>
<p>The new partnership with Arena Casino will allow the supplier to swiftly deploy 30 titles with the brand, including more popular options such as Royal Crown, Book of Gods, Stunning Hot, and more. Meanwhile Arena Casino sports one of the biggest game libraries in Croatia which means that it has a sizable gaming audience to try out new titles.</p>
<p>BF Games is confident that its titles will prove of sufficient interest to help the supplier bolster its footprint in the market and add to its active customer base. BF Games is keen to consolidate its presence in European markets but is also preparing to pivot more aggressively towards other regions such as North American and Latin America.</p>
<p>BF Games Head of Business Development Claudia Melcaru was excited at this new opportunity, seeing in it a chance to significantly grow the companyâ€™s presence in the country. She described Arena Casino as an incredibly popular option with local players and said that she was looking forward to seeing how the brand would benefit from the "smash hit games" brought on by BF Games.</p>
<p>BF Games has definitely been on the offensive in Europe. The company launched its content with Stanleybet.ro and Superbet.ro in Romania. While scoping out the Eastern European market, the supplier also decided to take a plunge into Bulgaria, another up-and-coming market where companies such as Pragmatic Play have been setting up development capabilities.</p>
<p>Not least, BF Games made its ambitions for the US market known and has procured the services of SCCG Management to ensure that it begins working on expanding in the region.</p>
