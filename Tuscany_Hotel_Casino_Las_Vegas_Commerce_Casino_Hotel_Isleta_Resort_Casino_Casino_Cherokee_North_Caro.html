<p>Hollywood star Vince Vaughn is going to be the new face of Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino’s online gambling products across the United States.</p>
<p>“Prince Vaughn” Will Promote Caesars iGaming Offerings Across the US</p>
<p>Wedding Crashers star Vince Vaughn is taking on the role of “Prince Vaughn” as the actor has become the new brand ambassador for Caesars Entertainment’s Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino division.</p>
<p>The actor will be promoting all of Caesars’ iGaming products that are offered through various platforms.</p>
<p>Vaughn, who has been amusingly duped by the Sultan of Slots and the Ruler of Roulette, will take part in future marketing campaigns, including all platforms such as TV, social media channels, web promotions, and so on.</p>
<p>In addition to Caesars iGaming products, Vaughn will also actively promote and participate in events and initiatives in connection with Caesars Entertainment’s loyalty program called Caesars Rewards.</p>
<p>This will include showcasing the integration of the iGaming app with the Caesars Rewards program, the features the app offers to customers, and the gaming products that are offered through the app.</p>
<p>Vince Vaughn has embraced the partnership and has noted his love for Las Vegas and gambling: “Working with Caesars is special for me. With my long history of love for Las Vegas and gaming, I am excited to be part of the royal family with Caesar and Cleo.”</p>
<p>Chief Marketing Officer of Caesars Digital Sharon Otterman also noted that Vaughn fits right in in the role of Prince of Caesars’ iCasino embodying the entertainment experience Caesars customers have with the company’s cutting-edge iGaming mobile application.</p>
<p>Caesars Already Released the First Ad Starring Vaughn</p>
<p>This is not the first time Vince Vaughn has partnered with Caesars Entertainment. He collaborated with the company in connection with the World Series of Poker (WSOP®). In the 2022 edition, Vaughn took up the important job of Celebrity Master of Ceremonies on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Vaughn has already starred in his first ad for the casino behemoth. In the new Caesars spot called Full Caesar, one can also see the familiar faces of comedian JB Smoove and Archie, Cooper, Eli, and Peyton from the Mannings, the notorious football family. The ad showcases the perks players get through Caesars Rewards.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino currently operates in 27 US states. Its launch in April 2021 was part of the company’s efforts to further expand the North American iGaming market.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment operates numerous retail casinos across the US and in Ontario, Canada, however, it seeks to develop a strong presence with its online and mobile gambling products by differentiating the player experience it offers from other brands with unique features such as quick payouts, cash-out features and many more.</p>
