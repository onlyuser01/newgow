<p>After announcing the launch of a new game portfolio together with Coolbet at the beginning of May and preparing to develop fresh signature-style games, business-to-business iGaming content provider Push Gaming is ready for a new release. The company has announced the launch of a sequel to one of its most popular slot series, Fat. The new game is called Fat Banker and it will become accessible to all partners in regulated markets across its network.</p>
<p>Fat Banker Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Reels: 6</p>
<p>Rows: 6</p>
<p>Paylines: 50</p>
<p>RTP: 96.43% | 94.45%</p>
<p>Hit Freq: N/A</p>
<p>Max Win: 25,000x</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0,10/100</p>
<p>Explore Wall Street’s High Life in the Twenties</p>
<p>Fat Banker invites fans of the popular Fat series to embark on yet a new captivating adventure, after exploring the comic Fat Rabbit, Fat Santa, and Fat Drac universes over the years. This time around, the developer will carry players back in time, to the 1920s. There, they will meet the main game character, a fat and wealthy banker who loves his luxurious life.</p>
<p>Along with his loyal wife and dog, the banker will keep scooping up big wins up to 25000X the original bet. The action takes place before the dramatic crash of the market in 1929, during the glory years when Wall Street was a place of eye-catching luxury and wealth.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the game has been designed with luxurious buildings in the background, completed by the relaxing jazz music heard playing while the reels are spinning. The game is packed with symbols of cigars, top hats and cigars, and the wealthy businessman’s red-headed wife and dog (top-paying symbols). Hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs are the lower-paying symbols available within the game. The game’s wild symbols are represented by a money bag and the fat banker. The silver safe, multiplier, and bullion symbols can also be landed during the free spins round.</p>
<p>Special Game Features</p>
<p>Commenting on the new launch, Push Gaming’s chief executive officer James Marshall explained the game is an expansion of their “much-loved Fat Series” while bringing a one-of-a-kind twist to the constantly growing franchise. Marshall also expressed his feelings of excitement in relation to the team bringing the 1920’s theme into the spotlight alongside fresh multipliers, instant win prizes, and extra features.</p>
<p>Bullion Symbols</p>
<p>These symbols can be landed on any of the six reels. They will automatically trigger bet multipliers up to 100x. Players must land a silver safe symbol on the sixth reel in order to be granted a prize.</p>
<p>Red Car Feature</p>
<p>This feature is triggered at the end of a reel spin. When the Wild Money Bags symbol has multipliers tied to it, the Silver Safe and Bullion symbols can also be randomly added to the reels to beef up the wins.</p>
<p>Free Spins Round</p>
<p>Landing the Fat Banker symbol together with the Wild Money Bag symbol will send players straight into the Free Spins round. Here, players receive five free spins. Next, the Banker symbol will start to move around. Landing any of the Wild Money Bags will boost the progress meter, causing the Fat Banker to grow and triggering more free spins. During the free spins round, the Red Car mechanism part of the base game turns into a Gold Car.</p>
<p>The game is available for play on all devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
