<p>R Franco Digital, the digital arm of R. Franco Group, has increased its presence and exposure in the Spanish market</p>
<p>The company is expanding through a new content deal with 888casino, a renowned global brand that brings some of the most powerful iGaming products to the local market where R. Franco Group is headquartered.</p>
<p>The partnership will yield dividends to both participants, allowing the 888casino brand to significantly expand its clout in the regulated market in the country while also giving R. Franco Digital a better read of the local gaming landscape and the opportunity to bring its products to new audiences.</p>
<p>888casino’s player base is already impressive and so is the company’s catalog which will now be enriched with R. Franco Digital’s own picks, including Vacuum Buster, Cyborg 30L, and Witches South.</p>
<p>R. Franco Digital has confirmed that more products will be introduced with 888casino over the coming months. The partnership was hailed by 888 VP B2C of Casino Talya Benyamini who said that the partnership with R Franco Digital is a significant opportunity to grow the operator’s existing quality library of titles in Spain and appeal to local players more strongly.</p>
<p>“In addition to developing our own titles in-house, partnering with developers like R Franco Digital is a critical part of our content and product leadership strategy and ensures that we offer players new and differentiated experiences,” Benyamini explained.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, R. Franco Digital CCO Mario Benito noted that the partnership represented a significant watershed for the company and its journey in the regulated Spanish market. Benito praised the opportunity to be working with one of the definitive market leaders in the face of 888casino and said that the tie-up would no doubt help grow the supplier’s customer base.</p>
<p>R. Franco Digital Pursues Global Growth Opportunities</p>
<p>He further added that the company was very excited to further explore this opportunity with 888 and bring more games to both R. Franco Digital’s home market and beyond. As to the company’s expansion, R. Franco Digital has been striking important content partnerships in places such as Latin America and Europe.</p>
<p>R. Franco Digital presently provides products through the IRIS 4.0 platform which is available at 40 providers across the sports and casino verticals. The company has confirmed that it has a number of new partnerships on the waitlist with their names revealed later in the year.</p>
