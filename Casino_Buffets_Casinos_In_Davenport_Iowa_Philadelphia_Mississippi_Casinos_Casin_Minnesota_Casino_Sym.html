<p>Josh Tromans-Jones is the Chief Innovation Officer at Symplify, and today we sit down with him to talk about a range of matters. Josh walks us through how Symplify leverages its powerful AI-driven CRM ecosystem to put operators in control of their own data. He explains how the company has blazed a trail in the cross-channel marketing automation for marketers and CRM teams and talks about the prominence of regulation in this modern day.</p>
<p>Q: Josh, can you tell us a little more about Symplify’s core proposition and why you have been in the news so much of late? What makes companies seek out Symplify’s products and services?</p>
<p>Symplify’s AI driven CRM ecosystem is built on 20 years’ industry experience, and this creates truly</p>
<p>personalised player experiences. We’ve been around since before marketing automation became a movement and the reason, we know that, is that we were the first company to automate flows for our customers. The service leverages cutting edge technology to empower operators to confidently take control of their own data.</p>
<p>Our success stems from working closely together with our partners’ customers and developing bespoke features that enable the CRM team to be best in class. We bring you the future of igaming CRM, now.</p>
<p>Symplify is a leader in cross-channel marketing automation for marketers and CRM teams. Our platform is equally adept for the digital and land-based casino space. Partners have 11 different communication channels at their fingertips and a powerful AI customer retention operation that optimises retention and reactivation.</p>
<p>As a business we’re constantly innovating our offering and working with more partners which explains why we’re often grabbing the headlines within the iGaming media. PlayNorth and Soft2Bet are two of the most recent clients we’ve signed and there was lots of news interest in the fact we’ve enhanced our Responsible Gaming Engine to bring it in line with the latest UKGC criteria.</p>
<p>Q: How important is to have a good responsible gambling awareness as part of a gaming company’s CRM system today and do you see business in the industry meeting a certain standard?</p>
<p>Good operators have a duty of care to their customers when providing sports betting and casino experiences. It’s imperative that gaming experiences are within a socially responsible environment to project players from the harms of addictive gambling. Our relentless commitment to RG has seen us add a core AI element to the Symplify service that provides more robust and independent means to keep players safe, rather than self-exclusion and self-imposed restriction tools.</p>
<p>Our proprietary Responsible Gaming engine uses an algorithm to determine a player’s risk of developing into a problem gambler. Once a pattern is identified it assigns an appropriate player rating so operators can step in before the situation deteriorates. This is especially important as we move into an incredibly busy period within the sporting calendar, against the backdrop of a cost-of-living-crisis, where the World Cup will take centre stage. The tournament will bring multiple games to TV screens daily and a wave of new users or more engaged users. AI helps operators quickly gain a deep understanding of their audience and communicate with personalised messaging, at the right time.</p>
<p>Identifying problem gamblers is a complex process and relies on building and adapting algorithms using case studies. Machine learning capabilities have been integrated into Symplify that are applied to markers of harm and respond to changing behaviour. Accurate data is the biggest factor as AI’s impact diminishes when the data is weak or the problems not well defined.</p>
<p>Q: Can you tell us a little more about your recent entry into the UK market. What does align with the UKGC guidelines mean for Symplify?</p>
<p>Symplify made the decision to enhance its Responsible Gaming Engine to bring it in line with the latest UKGC criteria. The Responsible Gaming Engine is now fully UKGC compliant after passing the highest technical standards demanded by the department. It’s widely recognised that the UKGC is one of the most influential regulatory bodies and it is a proud moment for the business to know we’re compliant.</p>
<p>Our RG Engine automates the risk categorisation of players which forms a pivotal element within Symplify’s CRM ecosystem. Highly accurate results are achieved by algorithmically analysing player activity such as deposits and wagering patterns. These categories are then used in other parts of the Symplify ecosystem such as multi-channel send-outs to "at risk" players.</p>
<p>Additional RG security is provided by exploring session duration, login activity and other factors. The RG Engine works across multiple verticals and is designed to support operators in creating bespoke journeys to automate the communication. A specialist Symplify RG team is available on demand to optimise the process if required.</p>
<p>Q: Have the customer/regulatory needs evolved in a way that has made Symplify introduce a fundamental change of its platform in the past year?</p>
<p>For us regulatory compliance isn't new, however it is something that has absolutely grown in prominence. At every step we have consulted with partners to ensure they are part of the development cycle that ensures the platform is best of breed, when it comes to housing Responsible Gaming measures. Measures have included Bonus API, automatic ring fencing of at-risk players via Symplify Sendgate. Compliance is no longer European centric, and we operate our Gaming vertical on the global stage, so for Symplify, compliance is one of the most important features we have.</p>
<p>Q: Can you wrap up by telling us why businesses in the gambling industry should seek out Symplify and what added value they can enjoy?</p>
<p>Symplify is a trailblazer in cross-channel marketing automation for marketers and CRM teams. We work in sync with our partners to gain an in-depth understanding of their business needs to better support them on their individual growth strategies. We pride ourselves on an ever-expanding portfolio of clients which depend on us to bring customer journeys to life with true omnichannel engagement. The Symplify support service gives partners direct communication with our team to ensure you’re best placed to power your sales processes and take your marketing communication to the next level.</p>
