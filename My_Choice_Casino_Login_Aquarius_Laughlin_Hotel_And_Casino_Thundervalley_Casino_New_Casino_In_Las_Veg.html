<p>Inter Miami vs. Charlotte FC is one of the most interesting duels of the Leagues Cup quarterfinal</p>
<p>Lionel Messi has been nothing short of brilliant since coming to Inter Miami, but his new teammates haven’t been as great. This goes especially for those playing in the defensive line, who’ve allowed too many goals (four in the previous game). This is actually great news for Charlotte CF whose only chance of beating Inter Miami is to outscore the “Herons.” So, can “The Crown” do it?</p>

<p>Lionel Messi and the Herons Eager to Keep Scoring</p>
<p>Lionel Messi has played only 294 minutes for Inter Miami so far, but he’s already scored 7 goals for his new team. Two of those happened in the previous game, in which the Herons defeated FC Dallas on penalties, after 4-4 in regulation.</p>
<p>It’s Messi who the Herons need to thank for that, but the question is whether he can keep on bailing them out. The thing is that Inter Miami’s defense has been so leaky lately that there’s a worry they might get outscored by Charlotte FC.</p>
<p>The worst thing is that it’s not just their defensive line that’s been bad, but their midfielders have also underperformed in a couple of games in the Leagues Cup 2023. The job of the midfielders is to control the game, ensuring that the ball stays in their possession. However, they lost possession in a couple of crucial moments in the previous game, allowing FC Dallas’s forwards to exact their counterattacks.</p>
<p>Charlotte CF’s Only Option is to Go All-In on the Offense</p>
<p>Everyone seems to realize that it’s impossible to defend against Lionel Messi. This guy looks unstoppable right now, with some of his teammates from the Inter Miami attacking department also looking very good lately.</p>
<p>That said, Charlotte’s only road to victory on Friday is to try and outscore Inter Miami. The good news is that these guys are good offensively. They’ve scored eight goals so far in the Leagues Cup, while in the 2023 MLS, they’ve scored 30 goals so far (in 23 games).</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Charlotte FC Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Miami’s coach Tata Martino will probably try to patch up his defense, but we don’t think this will prevent Charlotte FC from finding the net at least once on Friday. This means that it’s going to be Messi again who will get to bail the Herons out. Knowing that he’s arguably the best player ever to walk the earth, we think he’s going to do it once again.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
