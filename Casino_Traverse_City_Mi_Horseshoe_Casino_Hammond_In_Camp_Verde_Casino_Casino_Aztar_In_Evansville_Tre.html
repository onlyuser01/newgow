<p>Liverpool isn’t doing great in the English Premier League, but in the Champions League, they have two wins after three rounds. It’s almost the opposite when it comes to Glasgow Rangers, who have all losses in the UCL so far.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Reds are playing Manchester City next weekend in the Prem, their players might not be 100% focused on Wednesday’s UCL game. Is this something Rangers can take advantage of? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Rangers Going All-In in Front of Their Fans</p>
<p>At Ibrox Stadium, Rangers are usually very good. They did lose 3-0 to Napoli the last time they played a UCL game at home. However, the Italians were simply brilliant in that game, putting on a truly vintage performance.</p>
<p>This time, Rangers’ opponent might not be too fired up. Actually, we expect it to be the other way around. If they don’t want to finish at the bottom of the group table, Rangers need to go for a win on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They will have support from the stands, which could put them in beast mode. The trouble is that they might not have the manpower to beat such a big team as Liverpool.</p>
<p>Liverpool Players Might be Thinking (Only) About the Premier League</p>
<p>Before the start of the 2022-23 season, Liverpool was the second favorite to win the Premier League. However, after 10 rounds of the Prem, they got only 10 points. Their most recent game saw them lose 3-2 to Arsenal in London, and they’re going to have a huge task on their hands next weekend when they welcome Manchester City at Anfield.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, their minds might already be set on Sunday’s EPL spectacle. Another problem is that they have some serious problems with injuries, which is why coach Jurgen Klopp might decide to give some backup players a chance in Scotland.</p>
<p>Rangers vs Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Oddsmakers see Liverpool as an odds-on favorite in Wednesday’s game, but we think Rangers have what it takes to turn the game into real drama on the pitch. That said, we expect to see plenty of goals at Ibrox, although Rangers probably won’t score enough to win any points.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool to win; Over 3.5 goals</p>
