<p>Powered by Tally Technology Group, the new game grants football fans a chance to win prizes by submitting correct predictions for upcoming games of the team</p>
<p>Los Angeles Rams and football fans alike are in for a treat this season, thanks to the launch of a new predictor game that features plenty of prizes. The new game, which enables players to forecast games to win different prizes, is powered by Tally Technology Group and presented by Pechanga Resort Casino, the leading entertainment and gaming destination.</p>
<p>The new Rams Pick ‘Em contest, marks the fifth such activation for the famous football team. The free-to-play mobile-web predictions game challenges Rams and football fans to predict correctly the outcome of upcoming games of the team.</p>
<p>Testing their knowledge and ability, the game allows players to submit predictions five days before a game. The predictions for the game remain open and can be subject to change before kickoff. Similar to other predictor games, the Rams Pick’Em contest will feature weekly and season-long leaderboards, allowing sports fans to collect points.</p>
<p>Within the weekly leaderboard, players that rank between 1st and 10th place will secure prizes that can be gift cards to RamsFanShop.com, autographed memorabilia and merchandise, as well as Rams tickets and others. On the other hand, the season-long winners will have a chance to win unique prizes such as a 2024 Rams suite experience, 2024 season tickets or all-inclusive club seats for one of the team’s future preseason games. Additionally, sports fans that participate in the game and submit a pick will automatically enter a drawing that would award two tickets for the NFL Championship game this year.</p>
<p>Another Successful Collaboration between Tally and the Rams</p>
<p>Brad Vettese, Tally’s CEO, explained that the company was delighted to once again join forces with the Rams for this new activation. He highlighted that Tally helped deliver the first Rams Pick’em game, the first Rams $1 million Perfect Pick grand prize, along with other thrilling activations. “It is a great partnership, and one that we value immensely,” said Vettese in conclusion.</p>
