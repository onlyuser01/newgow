<p>888Poker is returning to Bucharest, with a freshly revealed graphic for the upcoming 888Live. The operator will also be sponsoring the 2019 Wold Championship, continuing to be a notable backer of on-site tournaments.</p>
<p>888Poker Reveals Bucharest Live Schedule</p>
<p>Held from March 4th through March 10th at the Intercontinental Hotel in Bucharest, Romania, the 888Live event will prove a strong draw for the regional community.</p>
<p>The event promise to fetch entrants at least €300,000 judging by the 2018 performance when the prize pool hit the neat €360,192.</p>
<p>With the London Live taking place now and serving as a precursor and a first event for the overall 2019 888 poker bonanza, event winners will stand a chance to fetch a package for the world’s crowning poker festival, the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in July.</p>
<p>The package specifically covers the buy-in into the Main Event and it’s part of 888’s half-year promotion, allowing skilled players to make their way through into the most significant event of the year.</p>
<p>888Live Bucharest Tournaments Worth Your Money</p>
<p>Presently, 888Live Bucharest promises to run a handful of events that will immediately catch your eye. The Opening Event 1A on March 4th starts with a €230 buy-in at 17:00 +2 GMT. If you haven’t had a chance to win a free pass for the Main Event, you can opt for the Satellite to Main Event starting at 21:00 in exchange for €115.</p>
<p>888Live Bucharest events range between €60 and €1,700, with re-entries varying between 2 pe for the opening event and unlimited for almost all other events. The Turbo Deepstack is set up as a Freezeout and the Deepstack allows one additional re-entry.</p>
<p>Tuesday, March 5th, is pretty much a repeat of the same events, with Opening Even 1B and another Satellite to Main Event underway, which eventually gets you to Wednesday when the Main’s first day kicks off.</p>
<p>The satellites will continue even then, giving late arrivals an opportunity to proceed. On March 7, you will see a Ladies Event with a quite comfortable €60 buy-in.</p>
<p>How to Enter in the Bucharest 888Live</p>
<p>If you are itching to get into the fray without sparing precious penny, 888poker has you covered. The “888 Steps” is a multi-tiered competition consisting of six rounds. You can start playing with as little as €0.01 and eventually blasting your way through a comprehensive qualifying package that will cover all expenses related to:</p>

<p>€200 in bonus credit deposited into you 888poker balance</p>
<p>A buy-in for the Bucharest LIVE Main Event</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can wait a bit and join straight into one of the higher levels, as 888Poker imposes no restrictions. If you prefer, you can also drop by the full schedule of the event.</p>
