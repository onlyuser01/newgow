    <h1>St Kitts Marriott Resort Royal Beach Casino Casino Hinckley Mn Mayag ez Resort Casino Attire For Cas</h1>

<p>2022 AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am is the third PGA Tour event to take place in California this year. A favorite event of Hollywood celebrities like Bill Murray, Kevin Costner, and many others, is teeing off Thursday, February 3, 2022.</p>
<p>Apart from the star power in the audience, the tournament is going to have plenty of golfing superstars on the court. Patrick Cantlay, the world #3 is the biggest name on the list, followed by Daniel Berger and Will Zalatoris.</p>
<p>The three lead the way when it comes to favorites, as you can see in the section below.</p>
<p>2022 AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am Odds</p>
<p>Player Odds Patrick Cantlay +700 Daniel Berger +1100 Will Zalatoris +1800 Jason Day +2000 Jordan Spieth +2000 Justin Rose +2500 Cameron Tringale +2500 Maverick McNealy +2800 Seamus Power +2800 Matt Fitzpatrick +3300 *Odds taken from DraftKings on February 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Where and When</p>
<p>Where : Pebble Beach, CA</p>
<p>: Pebble Beach, CA When : Thursday, February 3, 2022</p>
<p>: Thursday, February 3, 2022 How to Watch: NBC Golf Channel</p>
<p>Patrick Cantlay Looking for His First Win Since September</p>
<p>Oddsmakers see Cantlay as the #1 favorite to win the event, although the odds of +800 suggest he might struggle to achieve his plan. The probable reason why the odds on the #3 player in the Official World Golf Ranking aren’t shorter is that Cantlay is without a win since September.</p>
<p>He finished the 2020-21 PGA Tour with two straight wins – BMW Championship (Maryland) and Tour Championship (Georgia). However, since then, he hasn’t done much.</p>
<p>Since the start of the year, he took part in two PGA Tour events. The first of those was the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Hawaii, which is where he finished in the #4 position. His second tournament of 2022 was The American Express, where he ended in the #9 place.</p>
<p>Sure, Cantlay hasn’t been playing too great but the guy surely has the talent to get back on the winning track and the Pebble Beach event seems like a perfect opportunity for that. The thing is that a number of elite golfers have decided to skip this event including Jon Rahm, Collin Morikawa, and many others.</p>
<p>What this means is that Cantlay’s biggest rival for the trophy is going to be last year’s champion, Daniel Berger.</p>
<p>Can Daniel Berger Retain His Title?</p>
<p>With an eagle on the last hole, Daniel Berger won himself the trophy at last year’s AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. It was his fourth PGA Tour win. However, since then, Berger hasn’t won anything in PGA Tour, but we did see him winning the 2021 Ryder Cup with Team US.</p>
<p>He surely has big plans for this year’s event but retaining the title really doesn’t seem very likely. Still, we are probably going to see him finish high, possibly even in the Top 3.</p>
<p>Pick: Patrick Cantlay</p>
