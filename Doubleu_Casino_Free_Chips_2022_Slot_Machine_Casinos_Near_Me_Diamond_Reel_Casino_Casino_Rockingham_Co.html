<p>The proprietor Atari crypto token will now be part of esports betting agency Unikrn’s ecosystem, offering both companies various benefits. Atari is planning to release a crypto casino later this year.</p>
<p>Unikrn Adds Atari Token and Products to Increase Network Value</p>
<p>The Atari Token introduced by the world’s leading consumer and entertainment brand, Atari, will now be part of esports betting agency Unikrn’s ecosystem to boost the betting, gaming and shopping experience. All of these verticals will be powered by Atari’s new token.</p>
<p>The partnership is yet another significant milestone for the Atari Token as the integration with the Unikrn’s ecosystem will allow the companies to test and see reception of the token in various verticals, including gambling and shopping.</p>
<p>As per the partnership, Unikrn will also have access to Atari’s catalog of gaming classics, including Centipede®, PONG®, and Asteroids®, the official press release stated. The token will be available for use as part of Unikrn’s UMode platform, a skill-based wagering initiative whereby players bet on themselves to achieving specific milestones within a game.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Unikrn co-founder and ex-Microsoft Ventures CEO Rahul Sood said that together, Atari and Unikrn are pioneers in the gaming industry ushering in progress in the industry.</p>
<p>Sood noted that betting will continue to be a significant part of the future operations of the company, and interest will only increase, prompting Unikrn to seek a partnership with Atari that will ultimately benefit its own community.</p>
<p>Atari CEO Says Both Companies Stand to Benefit from the Partnership</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Atari CEO Fred Chesnais has shared his opinion of the partnership and the Atari Token’s prospects. “Today we have forged another essential partnership to support Atari’s journey into cryptocurrency and blockchain-based entertainment experiences,” Chesnais noted.</p>
<p>He hailed Unikrn’s thriving ecosystem and said that it would provide stakeholders with additional utility and value. Similarly, the addition of Atari products to the Unikrn system will also prove of particular interest to Unikrn players.</p>
<p>Atari has seen a string of recent partnership designed to give the proprietor token a boost. The company struck a partnership with the Arkane Network, enabling developers to integrate the Atari Token in their products.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Atari joined hands with the Litecoin Foundation to help facilitate the use of LTC across its own gaming network. The Atari Token was also introduced to the Native Gaming Casino and it’s expected to debut on Atari’s own crypto casino, which is slated to debut later this year.</p>
