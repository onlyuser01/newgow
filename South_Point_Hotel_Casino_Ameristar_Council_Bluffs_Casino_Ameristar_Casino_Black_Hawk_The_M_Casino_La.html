    <h1>South Point Hotel Casino Ameristar Council Bluffs Casino Ameristar Casino Black Hawk The M Casino La</h1>

<p>Last week sept 25th I withdraw 2500$. I still don’t have it…all my verification was accept and they where telling me that the withdraw was proceeds on their side and was on my bank side…(see file)</p>
<p>But yesterday 29th sept I receive the 2500$ back in my Wildz account ??? I just asked them to explain me the situation and they tell me that will be escalated to the finance/verification team.</p>
<p>Today I just received a request from the verification team that a document is missing. Yet the past week all the evidence that asks me had been accepted my withdraw was in progress according to the status there remained only the acceptance step of my bank approved. Yesterday my withdraw was returned to my account without explanation and today I receive an email telling me that two documents are missing, one of which I do not understand what they want (see file)??? Especially since since last week my account has been verified status accepted ??? I'm starting to think that this casino is fraudulent and they continue to fool customers whit back and forward chat with lies</p>
