<p>777 Diamonds review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>777 Diamonds uses a few classic slot symbols like the Bar, Cherry and Bell to create an old style one-armed bandit feel. However, the main twist is that everything is rendered as precious stones. The Cherries are ruby orbs on emerald stems, the bells are cut from yellow sapphires, and, of course there are plenty of actual diamonds on the reels too.</p>
<p>The theme makes for a gentle twist on a familiar form.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Like many simple one-armed bandit inspired slots, the graphics aren’t too fancy. The symbols are well drawn and the animations clear but basic.</p>
<p>The music is a gentle piano track that might be a little low energy for a slot. It’s pretty relaxing, but most people play slots for excitement, which this rather undercuts.</p>
<p>The overall effect is of a gentle lounge style game, rather than the high speed flashy style of many slots.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>777 Diamonds uses a standard five reel, three row format. This comes with 25 win lines.</p>
<p>There is a gamble feature which players can use after a winning spin. It is the standard infinite deck of cards in which players can choose to bet their winnings either in a quadruple-or-nothing bet on the next card’s suit or a double-or-nothing bet on the card’s colour.</p>
<p>The gameplay is simple and pretty standard. That might not appeal to everyone, but it puts it on a par with most of the competition.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Bonus symbols on any one spin will award the player free spins. Three Bonus symbols gets a single free spin, four gets the player three free spins, and the maximum of five symbols gets the player ten free spins.</p>
<p>There are no additional bonuses to play.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 94.00%, much lower than our yardstick for average of roughly 96%. 94% is simply too expensive for us to recommend this slot and may explain the slot’s relatively low popularity in general.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.01 up to a maximum of $/£/€25.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a weak match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility. Given the low RTP, there is no volatility high enough to make this game appeal to us.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The poor RTP is enough to ruin this slot for us.</p>
<p>For those who are willing to pay the 6% per spin, the slot doesn’t offer very much for your buck. The style is simple, the bonuses are basic, and the volatility is middling.</p>
<p>Give this one a skip.</p>
