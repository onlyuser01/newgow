<p>Casumo, an innovative, award-winning and mobile-first iGaming company, has reinforced its leadership team with the addition of Francesco Postiglione as its chief executive offer. In this role, Postiglione will replace Oscar Simonsson, Casumo’s co-founder, who served as CEO for a time.</p>

<p>Postiglione also boasts four years with Napoleon Sports and Casino. He joined the operator as its general manager in 2017 and became CEO of its online operations in late 2018.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Napoleon Sports and Casino, Casumo’s new hire worked for Betclic Group for almost four years. His tenure with Betclic saw him work as head of Italy between 2013 and 2016, and as a managing director of international markets between 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>His earlier experiences saw him create and head Neomobile Gaming, which was behind Casino Planet – Italy’s first mobile-only casino operator. Postiglione also founded Giocacomodo.it and served as CEO of its Internet division.</p>
<p>Simonsson Welcomed Postiglione to the Casumo Family</p>
<p>Oscar Simonsson, one of Casumo’s founders, welcomed Postiglione on board. He said that the new appointee was the perfect pick for CEO and is certain that Postiglione will help his team drive innovation.</p>
<p>Francesco is the ideal candidate to take the helm at Casumo and we are confident that he will bring his wealth of experience and passion for innovation to the role. Oscar Simonsson, co-founder, Casumo Group</p>
<p>Simonsson added that the Casumo Group team is thrilled to welcome Postiglione as its CEO and is looking forward to working under him.</p>
<p>Postiglione also released a statement on his new position, sharing that he is glad to join Casumo. He praised the company for its knack for innovation and said that he cannot wait to lead the team to new heights.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to join Casumo, a company that I have long admired for its innovative and customer-centric approach to online gaming. I look forward to leading the team as we continue to grow and deliver the best possible gaming experience to our players. Francesco Postiglione, CEO, Casumo Group</p>
