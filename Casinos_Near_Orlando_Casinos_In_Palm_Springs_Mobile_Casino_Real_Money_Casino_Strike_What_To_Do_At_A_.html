    <h1>Casinos Near Orlando Casinos In Palm Springs Mobile Casino Real Money Casino Strike What To Do At A</h1>

<p>since I filed the complaint here - I did receive correspondence from them. However, they’re blatantly jerking me around. I sent them the ID once, they requested again. I sent a utility bill, my address, my name, recent (this is on their docs as approved for verification). First they said it’s an envelope so they denied. (It’s not an envelope by any measure it is a sheet of paper). Then they said it was a "notice". I responded clearly stating it was a BILL from my county utility company. It’s literally a sheet of paper. Unbelievable really. Copy pasting some correspondence below. The document in reference below never changed - their reason for denial changes. It’s exactly what they ask for. A direct bill with all information from my utility company.</p>
