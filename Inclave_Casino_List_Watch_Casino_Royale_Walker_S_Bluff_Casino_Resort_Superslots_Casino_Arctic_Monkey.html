    <h1>Inclave Casino List Watch Casino Royale Walker S Bluff Casino Resort Superslots Casino Arctic Monkey</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I signed up with BitStarz last night.</p>
<p>Based on the good rating from "Casino Guru".</p>
<p>So far I've only had good experience with it.</p>
<p>In total, I deposited around € 2000 and in the end I had around € 5000 in credit.</p>
<p>My account was already fully verified.</p>
<p>The first payout via Ethererum of € 500 then worked.</p>
<p>With regard to the speed of payment and verification so far, everything is really good!</p>
<p>However, when I tried to log in again a few hours later, my account was blocked.</p>
<p>After consulting the live chat it was only said that the reason was "bonus abuse".</p>
<p>I never claimed a bonus!</p>
<p>And no free spins or anything like that!</p>
<p>However, inquiries were not answered. It just said that the decision was final.</p>
<p>So I only played for real money and now I'm being told that there is nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>I shouldn't get my money paid out either.</p>
<p>From the Bitstarz Casino side, the case is closed, they say. Without being given a single reason, they simply keep € 4,500 real money from me.</p>
<p>I've experienced a lot but that's really amazing.</p>
<p>Mainly I won the money in LiveCasino playing Evolution games.</p>
<p>When asked by email, I was given a link for the "Bonus Conditions".</p>
<p>A clear answer why I was banned and a certain "example" of what I did wrong could not be given to me!</p>
<p>All I really want now is my money.</p>
<p>If you make mistakes you can talk about them and then have to see them.</p>
<p>But I didn't make a mistake. And you just refer to the conditions ??</p>
<p>I hope so much that the Guru Team can help me here ... !!!</p>
