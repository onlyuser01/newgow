<p>The debate surrounding the introduction of a statutory levy in the United Kingdom to help fund treatment and research of and into problem gambling has been a hotly debated topic, opposed by industry representatives, and now very much a whisker away from becoming a tangible reality.</p>
<p>During the public consultation about the introduction of a statutory levy on gambling operators, which will charge a percentage of their revenues that will be contributed to fund gambling harm research and help with prevention and treatment, GambleAware CEO Zoë Osmond spoke of the importance of navigating and guiding this process carefully so that it is impactful enough.</p>
<p>Yet, the benefits of such a move by the government are already well-established. "Following years of uncertainty, the levy will provide clarity of funding for the gambling harms sector, support long-term planning and prevent duplication of work," Osmond said.</p>
<p>Osmond believes that thanks to this decision, the levy will transform how the prevention and treatment of gambling harms happen. This includes people who are already suffering from problem gambling, but also those who are at risk, including their family members.</p>
<p>There is already enough data to indicate that there are many people in Great Britain who could benefit from proper treatment with specific strategies that need to be executed in a guided and controlled manner to achieve maximum impact.</p>
<p>"A public health approach is the most effective and cost-efficient way of addressing societal issues like gambling harms," Osmond added, outlining what can be done to ensure that treatment and prevention indeed reach their intended mark and create value for consumers.</p>
<p>Osmond spoke of GambleAware’s own strategic commission skills, capacity, capability, and experience. She also noted that the organization has been known to work collaboratively to achieve the ultimate goal which is to help tackle problem gambling across Great Britain, as well as collaborate with counterparts in Scotland and Wales and work closely with the National Health Service.</p>
<p>GambleAware also has planned how to make the most out of the additional funds that would be coming in, with some of the proposed measures including the co-commissioning of various levels of interventions as well as the introduction of more public campaigns that will further help the public grow aware of the issue, and importantly – how to seek help if any red flags begin to appear in ordinary behavior.</p>
<p>"Lastly, a smooth and stable transition to the new system is vital," Osmond adds, as the additional money coming in would not necessarily mean a safer gambling environment unless the transition is done right.</p>
