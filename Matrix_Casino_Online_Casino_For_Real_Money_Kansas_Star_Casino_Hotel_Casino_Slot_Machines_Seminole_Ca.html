    <h1>Matrix Casino Online Casino For Real Money Kansas Star Casino Hotel Casino Slot Machines Seminole Ca</h1>

<p>Zeal, a provider of internet lotteries, has achieved and secured anew milestone by further strengthening its geographical reach through a dedicated launch of online games in Germany. This considerably expands the company’s clout and reach of operations, bringing fresh opportunities.</p>
<p>This partnership is facilitated by LOTTO24 AG, a subsidiary of the company, and its shops. As a result, players will be able to access new games, and the rollout follows a license approval by the Joint Gaming Authority of the Federal States (GGL).</p>
<p>ZEAL has welcomed the opportunity, with company Chief Executive Officer Helmut Becker saying that the German license obtained by the firm would allow it to create brand-new gaming experiences.</p>
<p>He described the strategy of the recent past as one of "determined investments" that was finally bearing fruit.</p>
<p>"ZEAL's clear focus remains online lottery brokerage. With online games, however, we now have another product area that should quickly gain weight," Becker added. There are other benefits, too, though, and they impact consumers as well.</p>
<p>For one, ZEAL has long stood as a champion of regulated and legal gambling. The company has dispensed significant efforts to ensure that it helps guide players to safe and licensed products and portals, which will continue as part of its new licensure in Germany.</p>
<p>The company is very much confident that it will be able to continue to deliver on this mission. ZEAL Instant Games Managing Director Julian Tietz reiterated the company’s position and said that ZEAL wishes to uphold the highest standards of safe and responsible gambling above all else.</p>
<p>Tietz added that ZEAL goes well beyond regulatory recommendations and the established gambling framework to ensure that it fulfils this objective. The company has been known to utilize a range of solutions to this end. The company has been putting AI applications and other tech to ensure that consumers are always safe and protected.</p>
<p>ZEAL is determined to scale its presence in Germany through online games, and by ensuring that it is maintaining a healthy attitude towards responsible gambling as well.</p>
