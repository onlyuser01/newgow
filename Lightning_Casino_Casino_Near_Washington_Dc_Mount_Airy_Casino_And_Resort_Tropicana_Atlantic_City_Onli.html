<p>Boyd Gaming Corporation plans to create a new Treasure Chest Casino in Kenner, LA. A press release issued by the gaming operator following a January 5 press conference stated that the company intends to replace the existing riverboat casino with a “state-of-the-art, ground-based gaming facility.” The new casino is expected to open for business in the latter part of 2023.</p>
<p>Boyd Looks for Treasure</p>
<p>The Treasure Chest casino will be a single-level structure and will include several new restaurants and bars. Nearly 10,000 square feet of conference and meeting space will also be available. A FanDuel-branded sportsbook and parking will be located directly next to the casino entrance. The 47,000square-foot casino is expected to be the main attraction, offering a wide variety of innovative gaming options.</p>
<p>Keith Smith, CEO and president of the company, said in a release, “With this project, we are proud to reinvest in a community that has been an important part of the Boyd Gaming family for more than 27 years.”</p>
<p>Kenner Mayor Ben Zahn stated that Treasure Chest was an invaluable corporate and community partner over the last 27 years. Treasure Chest supports the local Police Department and City Council districts, as well as its capital projects.</p>
<p>More Jobs and Revenue for the Community</p>
<p>Smith added that the all-new Treasure Chest is going to bring more jobs, tax revenue and visitors to the City Of Kenner and Jefferson Parish. It is expected to significantly enhance the Treasure Chest name and give guests a “more enjoyable gaming entertainment experience.”</p>
<p>Treasure Chest has been a floating casino located on Lake Pontchartrain in Kenner and is being moved onto land as part of a $90-million expansion. This was expected after Boyd Gaming Corp. was granted a renewed lease by the City Council last January. It was made possible through a 2018 Louisiana law that allows floating casinos to be moved onto land.</p>
<p>The casino was right in the middle of the pack in terms of revenue. There were 15 floating casinos in operation in Louisiana last year, and Treasure Chest was ranked eighth in revenue for the five-month period from July to November.</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming plans to start construction on the project this summer.</p>
