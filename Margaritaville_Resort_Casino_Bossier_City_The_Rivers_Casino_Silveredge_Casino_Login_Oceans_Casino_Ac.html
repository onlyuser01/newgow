<p>Busy head of the month for iGaming platform supplier EveryMatrix. The company did not only announce a fresh content deal with German slot creator Apparat Gaming on Tuesday, but it also scored a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario. The provider is now getting ready to go live in the Canadian province and secure its foothold in the market that opened at the beginning of April.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Getting Ready to Go Live</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s fresh Canadian license will serve as a guarantee for players’ safety when engaging with the supplier’s online turnkey products. The distributor will offer its proprietary gaming content along with its casino and sportsbook technology developed in-house to operators that are also preparing to launch in the same market. The list of offerings will include games from Armadillo Studios and Spearhead Studios, two gaming studios combining over 100 branded games with the North American theme in place. Some of the most popular games released by the two studios are The Lioness which introduces players to Mixed Martial Arts champion Amanda Nunes and John Daly Spin It And Win It, a game inspired by John Daly’s character, an American golf pro.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Americas’ president Erik Nyman called the registration approval from the Canadian regulator “an important milestone” for the company in its expansion on the North American continent. Nyman added the company was “very excited” to be able to offer its products to current American customers and a plethora of additional operators ready to penetrate the largest gaming jurisdiction in Canada.</p>
<p>What Will EveryMarix Gain From Entering Ontario’s Market?</p>
<p>The gaming market in the province was finally opened at the end of three long years of heated negotiations and preparations. Its Final standards regulating all online gaming and betting activities along with the banning of autoplay, fresh gambling advertising and integrity requirements, and limitations on game designs were officially published last September.</p>
<p>The market has, ever since, become essential for the region and also a critical component of the global iGaming universe. Fresh operators are joining it periodically and the market is constantly expanding, thanks to the way it guarantees a safe and protective gaming environment for gamblers who are at risk of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>As a member of the iDEA Growth in the US, World Lottery Association, and European Lotteries Association, EveryMatrix will grow its further reputation and expand its visibility in the industry by entering the Ontario market. The company will deliver its online gaming software, content, and services to a plethora of Tier 1 operators and fresh brands. The platform will allow operators to scale and choose their preferred modular products based on their exact needs.</p>
<p>At the moment, EveryMatrix employs over 650 staff members and caters to the needs of 150 global customers. The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario also gave Greentube the green light to launch on the Ontario market by issuing a similar license.</p>
