<p>B2B multiplayer engagement software developer BeyondPlay announced that it had signed a new partnership with slots game creator Big Time Gaming. BeyondPlay will include some of Big Time’s products in its operator-oriented portfolio of multiplayer-enabled games.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Have a History of Successful Cooperation</p>
<p>BeyondPlay Founder and CEO Karolina Pelc announced the news on the company’s LinkedIn page. She expressed high hopes for the new partnership and likened it to their 2017 collaboration with Big Time Gaming, LeoVegas Group, and CasinoGrounds.com. Together, they launched the slots game Danger High Voltage during a Letsgiveitaspin live stream on Twitch. The launch included an early iteration of a set of custom betting features that allowed betters to play together.</p>
<p>It was one of the first times we saw the true potential of the gaming community coming together. Karolina Pelc, founder, and CEO of BeyondPlay</p>
<p>Pelc described the experience as a sneak peek into the future. According to her, the now legendary slot title allowed BeyondPlay to experiment with shared playing experience as a new form of spectator engagement. The campaign won the LeoVegas Affiliates’ “Most innovative marketing campaign of the year” award and proved that live streaming was a potent tool for driving engagement. The trend has since gained momentum, and live streaming new game releases have become standard practice for many operators.</p>
<p>BeyondPlay Focuses on the Multiplayer Experience</p>
<p>BeyondPlay’s CEO did not elaborate on the details of the new partnership. It is safe to assume that it will build on the company’s previous cooperation with Big Time Gaming in the multiplayer genre. Pelc lauded Big Time’s extensive collection of quality titles and their ability to introduce revolutionary game mechanics. She expressed gratitude for the game developer’s continued support and demonstrated confidence that the two companies could repeat 2017’s success.</p>
<p>The excitement about where this partnership can take us is… BIG TIME. Karolina Pelc</p>
<p>According to BeyondPlay, their new product will be just as promising as the previous collaboration between the companies. The LinkedIn post announcing the new project stated that there would be an official press release with detailed information this week and a post from BeyondPlay Chief Operating Officer Jacqui Gatt.</p>
<p>The B2B software developer recently had another chance to show off its technology via a partnership with Pragmatic Play. BeyondPlay’s software enables operators and suppliers to offer a multiplayer experience on existing content. Multiple players can join a single slot game session, interact with each other and combine their stakes. It will soon become clear how the company’s newest product will refine this experience.</p>
