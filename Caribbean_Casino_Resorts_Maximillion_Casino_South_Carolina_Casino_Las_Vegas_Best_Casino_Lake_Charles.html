<p>Salsa Technology, a company that specializes in the provision of various iGaming products and solutions, has announced a new partnership with Darwin Gaming, a prominent supplier that has developed a range of signature games for the industry, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>Players will get to experience a variety of high-quality games that are created by Darwin Gaming’s skilled in-house team and which will now be onboarded with Salsa’s dedicated aggregation platform, Salsa Gator. Darwin Gaming is a company that develops innovative instant win and crash games and Salsa Gator is an aggregator that will help the company focus on the Latin American and Brazilian markets in particular.</p>
<p>The integration of the games is seamless and facilitated by Salsa Gator’s experience in handling and onboarding new products and making them available to its network of partner operators, and their audiences. This latest expansion allows Salsa Gator to further strengthen its leadership position as one of the go-to options for operators looking to actively expand their game libraries.</p>
<p>Darwin Gaming has built a reputation as a supplier that provides outstanding products across the board and makes it possible for players to enjoy mobile-friendly titles. Thanks to this tie-up, Salsa Gator and its network will have access to popular choices by Darwin such as Luva Melhor do Mundo and Luva PowerBasket.</p>
<p>The platform also delivers more innovative and out-of-the-box titles, such as LuvaSuperGoal and Crash Evolution, all of which are designed to make sure that players are having the best possible experience. The partnership was welcomed by everyone involved, with Darwin Gaming COO Rui Pena saying that this alliance added to the "vibrant spirit of Brazil and the heartbeat of Latin America."</p>
<p>Darwin Gaming was a company that creates the right type of products that will appeal to Salsa Technology and its customers, Pena explained. Pena did not miss to praise Salsa for the company’s achievement in establishing a powerful distribution network as well, saying:</p>
<p>"Salsa’s strength is a perfect match for the energy and creativity of our games. We're especially eager to showcase our crash games and video bingos, where the pulse of Latin passion meets gaming excellence."</p>
<p>As to Salsa, Company Head of Marketing &amp; Sales Eliane Nunes welcomed the chance to be adding yet another prominent developer and supplier in the face of Darwin Gaming. Nunes said that the Salsa Gator platform is set to benefit greatly from this new partnership and ensure that the supplier’s crash and instant win games are an immediate success in Brazil in particular.</p>
<p>Salsa Technology has been rapidly scaling its presence in the iGaming market and particularly with its aggregation solution, as the company recently added RSA, another established supplier, to strengthen its presence in the Brazilian iGaming market.</p>
