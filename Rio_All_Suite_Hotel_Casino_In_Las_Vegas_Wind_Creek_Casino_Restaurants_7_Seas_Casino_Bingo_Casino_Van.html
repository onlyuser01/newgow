    <h1>Rio All Suite Hotel Casino In Las Vegas Wind Creek Casino Restaurants 7 Seas Casino Bingo Casino Van</h1>

<p>I used 4000 words earlier so I'll keep it short this time. Once you leave this page you can reload and start at 0 .</p>
<p>At vegadreams I achieved a turnover of €50 for the €680 bonus of €1800 out of €1800, although I came up to €65 with €50 + deposit bonus and played it down completely to €5 and with the last €5 the profit is €1800 € went completely to the bonus credit instead of my real credit. I was able to pay out a real balance of €1200 afterwards because I was so lucky. But from the actual 1800 €. The problem is I've been waiting for my €1200 since November 1st, 2022 and I'm supposed to upload something new every time for verification of the addressee, although I've done it 3 times. After 48 hours, an e-mail is sent to me in which it said 2 times I should mean it Verifying account which I have already done and just waiting for confirmation. The address button was still pending on the vegadream side. After writing to a casino employee online from there he sent me a new link to re-upload my address verification. I did this again. Today 05.11 09.00 I get the threat to verify my account otherwise my account will be blocked. So I uploaded it clearly and clearly 3 times even and I was paid 2 times 500€, the 1200€ are noted as outstanding in the history. They want to block my account and do not accept my verification.</p>
<p>I also have screenshots</p>
