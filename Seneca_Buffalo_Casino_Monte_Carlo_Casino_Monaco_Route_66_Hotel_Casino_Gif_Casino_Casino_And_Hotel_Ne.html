<p>The operator of iGaming and sports betting content, bet365,has signed a landmark deal with Push Gaming, an established B2B gaming supplier that will provide its range of top-shelf titles to the brand and strengthen its presence in the online casino sector.</p>
<p>Bet365 will benefit from a range of games and titles readily provided by Push Gaming, such as Fat Series, Jammin Jars’, Razor Shark, and Big Bamboo, among dozens of others. The partnership is not limited to a single jurisdiction, as Push Gaming and bet365 will seek to scale this collaboration across multiple territories, the press release confirmed.</p>
<p>Push Gaming Director of New Business Fiona Hickey welcomed the opportunity to see her company work with one of the most important iGaming brands in the sector. This tie-up gives a considerable chance to Push Gaming to move forward with its growth plans. Commenting on bet365, Hickey said:</p>
<p>It’s a brand that needs little introduction and is a sign of our current ambitions as we continue to expand where players can enjoy our title.</p>
<p>Hickey said that her company was excited to be able to introduce its games across a range of markets with one of the best top-tier operators. A bet365 spokesperson was similarly excited about the opportunity to see the supplier’s cutting-edge content added to the operator’s own shopping windows.</p>
<p>"The likes of Razor Shark and Jammin' Jars will be a valuable addition to the breadth of incredible entertainment we already offer and we’ll have a keen eye on what else Push brings to the table going forward," bet365 stated. They did not miss mentioning how successful Push Gaming has been over the past several months and its rapid pace of expansion and scaling of its international offer.</p>
<p>Push Gaming has been building up its presence all over Europe and the world. The company has put a particular focus on the market in the Netherlands most recently, with several tie-ups. A partnership was established with Kindred Group earlier this year, and another collaboration with 711 was signed in May.</p>
<p>Push Gaming has also been making strides with Chanz, a multi-jurisdictional online casino operator with a presence in Sweden, Denmark, and Estonia.</p>
