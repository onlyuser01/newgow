    <h1>Hustler Casino Borgata Hotel Casino Spa Reviews 3 Rivers Casino Kewadin Casino St Ignace Epiphone Ca</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play has become the latest supplier of online casino content to team up with Swiss4Win.ch, the online casino gaming brand of Casinò Lugano. This is an important partnership for both companies. Swiss4Win.ch is a local player that has been meticulously building up its presence in the market and hoping to ensure that it remains the go-to option for its existing audiences and attract new ones.</p>
<p>Part of this attraction has been conducted through the listing of new and capable suppliers, such as Pragmatic Play. Swiss4Win.ch has had a number of similar partnerships over the last months. Moving forward, the company will benefit from Pragmatic Play’s award-winning titles, including options such as the all-time favorite Peaky Blinders, Wolf Gold, and Gates of Olympus, all of which are well-established franchises in iGaming.</p>
<p>Casinò Lugano is also a prominent land-based casino brand in the country. The digitalization of its casino facilities has become a part of its overall strategy to remain competitive and sustainable with online casinos in Switzerland enjoying a special status whereby they can only be run by local companies.</p>
<p>Casinò Lugano CEO Paolo Sanvido was excited to be collaborating with Pragmatic Play. He described this as a "huge win" for the company. "We are proud to launch Pragmatic content as the first online casino in Switzerland, giving our players many exclusive titles that other operators cannot offer," concluded.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Chief Operating Officer Irina Cornides was similarly pleased with the events and welcomed the opportunity to be providing software for Swiss4Win, a local heavyweight company, which she praised. She further added that Casinò Lugano was an impressive and historic land-based operator and that this new partnership would help both companies excel in the Swiss market.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Pragmatic Play has entered the highly lucrative and promising market. Pragmatic Play has been working with a number of prominent brands and operators worldwide. The company recently revealed a partnership with Betway. In March this year, Pragmatic Play also confirmed that it is working to create a dedicated 888casino live studio. In South Africa, the company expanded with Hollywoodbets just a month after that in April.</p>
