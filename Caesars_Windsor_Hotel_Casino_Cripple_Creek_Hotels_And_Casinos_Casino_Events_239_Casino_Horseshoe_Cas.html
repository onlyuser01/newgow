<p>Dear Stefkataseva,</p>
<p>I would recommend you apply for the self-exclusion of your accounts if you feel you are struggling with your play.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, clearly state the reason for deactivating your account and specify the time period. Also, the email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as the casino support receives many requests per day. If it is marked visibly you will stand a better chance of having your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period ___ (permanently).</p>
<p>The reason for my decision is xxx (gambling problems)</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and that the self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send emails to casino support of the casinos you wish to self-exclude in:</p>
<p>(you can CC me at tomas@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>As the issue is not specific to a single casino, the complaint will now be closed. If you have any casino-specific issues in the future don't hesitate to contact us and we'll do our best to help. Thank you for your understanding. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any issues with online casinos in the future.</p>
