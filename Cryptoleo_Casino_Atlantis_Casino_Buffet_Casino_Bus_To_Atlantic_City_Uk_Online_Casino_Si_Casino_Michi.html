    <h1>Cryptoleo Casino Atlantis Casino Buffet Casino Bus To Atlantic City Uk Online Casino Si Casino Michi</h1>

<p>There are really a lot of book games, almost like sand by the sea.</p>
<p>We all know Book of Dead, Book of Ra and many more.</p>
<p>Many are enthusiastic about Book of Dead and I can't understand it.</p>
<p>Provider Pariplay has a game called Torros Gold!</p>
<p>The game is just like Book and Bulls. With one big difference - the chances of getting into a free game.</p>
<p>When you play Book and Bulls it really takes a long time to get a free spin; on very rare occasions you may get a free spin at the beginning.</p>
<p>Now from the point of view of my feelings, I would say at Book and Bulls-100 spins / 3-5 chances of a free game / 1-2 free spins</p>
<p>At Torros Gold I always play with automatic - mostly 25 spins. And it often happens that you have 3-5 chances of a free game - in phases you also get 1-3 free games!</p>
<p>That shouldn't mean that the free spins are all great, but even there I often have the feeling that there is something good here.</p>
<p>Since I have been playing, I have often received books 5 times, which is worth 200 times the bet - just like bulls-detto.</p>
<p>The characters themselves play in the books, if I compare them-come just as often or as little as in the other book games.</p>
<p>The difference is as follows. if you have book and bull the book free spins, what does a full picture with the character A count when you wager 1 euro? 150 euros!</p>
<p>With Torros gold this letter has a higher value. For a full picture with the letter a you get 500Eur for 1 euro!</p>
<p>And that's exactly why Torros Gold is the best book game - at least for me - you should really try it!</p>
<p>But I'm more happy when 3 bulls come. I then often compare it with book and bulls from Gamomat-Wild get stuck -10 free games.</p>
<p>At Torros Gold, with 20 cents, I've often made 100euro to 130!</p>
<p>There are also free spins, so you'll be happy when you see a game.</p>
<p>But the fact that you often get a free game with the wilds increases the chances that the 3rd or 4th time you get a good free game</p>
