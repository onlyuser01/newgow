<p>Information about Revolut casinos</p>
<p>Revolut is a UK-based financial technology (Fintech) start-up that offers a range of online banking services, including card payments, currency exchange and commission-free stock trading, to name just a few. In July 2021 it became the most valuable UK tech start-up in history, reaching a value of $33 billion.</p>
<p>Consumers can use Revolut to buy almost anything online with its physical or virtual debit cards recording millions of transactions per year. There are also many online casinos that accept Revolut as a deposit method, and you can find the best ones with Casino Guru. This page will show you how to do that, as well as give you more information about Revolut's service, how to make a deposit with it, as well as casino bonuses on 0ffer from Revolut-friendly casinos.</p>

<p>Revolut – a Fintech unicorn that's now mainstream</p>
<p>London has a reputation for being a global hub for fintech start-ups, and Revolut is one of the many success stories from there. Founded by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko in July 2015, it arose from a 'fintech incubator' in the Canary Wharf – a type of collaborative program that searched for new financial ideas.</p>
<p>Revolut stood out from other start-ups with the level of funding that it attracted. It earned 'unicorn' status after securing $250 million from DST Global in 2018 and it received a Challenger bank license in the same year.</p>
<p>In 2019, it started to offer commission-free stock trading to its customers who could invest on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange via the Revolut app. Soon after it agreed a partnership with Visa that opened up 24 new markets and brought in 3,500 more employees.</p>
<p>Another huge funding round just before the pandemic put the Revolut's value at £4.2 billion, and, possibly fuelled by lockdown, its customer base expanded considerably.</p>
<p>After applying for licenses in the UK and the USA, Revolut started to enjoy mainstream success in 2021, with around 15.5 million customers in its database. Its status as the UK's most valuable Fintech start-up is confirmed, and we can now consider it as a true rival to established high street banks, such as Barclays and HSBC.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of Revolut</p>
<p>Revolut prides itself on its easy-to-use service. Its app is super user-friendly, with a great design and a range of services available at your fingertips. You can decide whether to invest in stocks, make an instant payment to a friend or pay for items via Google Pay in just a few clicks.</p>
<p>Another advantage is its safety. As well as holding a banking license and being a UK-legislated company (meaning it has to comply with UK law) it also has fingerprint detection and sophisticated identity verification for its banking app. If you lose or forget your PIN then you can get a new one in a few easy steps, and you can also block your card quickly via the app.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about banking charges then Revolut is a great option as there aren't any. Transfers and payments are free, which makes a welcome change to the fees sometimes associated by traditional banks.</p>
<p>Revolut's normal service is free of charge. However, if you want to use Revolut's premium services, then you will have to pay a monthly fee of up to £12.99 ($18) a month. This will get you the 'Metal' package that includes 1% cashback and higher withdrawal and exchange limits, but might be expensive for a lot of people.</p>
<p>It also pays to keep an eye out for Revolut's ATM withdrawal fees in other countries: you have to pay if you surpass a certain limit. You may also have to pay a currency exchange fee in some places. For specific amounts, make sure you check the terms and conditions should you sign up.</p>
<p>How to use Revolut in online casinos</p>
<p>Revolut has earned a reputation as a user-friendly service, and the good news that making a casino deposit with it is also simple.</p>
<p>To do this, make sure your casino account is fully open and that you have your Revolut card or app to hand. Then, it's just a case of choosing 'Revolut' from the list of banking options in the casino's deposit section and entering your card details and the amount you want to deposit. If 'Revolut' isn't available, then you can select VISA or Mastercard instead and it should work just the same.</p>
<p>Once you've clicked 'confirm', you should see the funds hit your casino account right away. A delay of an hour or two is possible, although quite rare – if it's more than this, then it might be a good idea to contact Revolut or the casino to find out what the problem is.</p>
<p>Revolut also allows casino withdrawals, which typically take longer than deposits and sometimes come with a fee attached. This will depend on the casino you use, and some sites may not allow withdrawals at all.</p>
<p>How to find the best Revolut online casino</p>
<p>On this page, you'll see a list of online casinos that accept Revolut deposits. There's also a series of useful filters that will help you find the ones you need – 'All', for example, will give you the complete list of available Revolut sites on the Casino Guru database.</p>
<p>To refine this list, a good option is to select the 'Recommended' tab. This will give you the very best casinos that accept Revolut – ones that our team deem to give you the best chance of a great playing experience.</p>
<p>You can also see the latest Revolut casinos added to the list by selecting 'Newly opened'. While some of these are so new that they may not have a rating yet, they might offer some tempting deals as they try to make a name for themselves. Take care with these, though.</p>
<p>If you want to find Revolut casino sites with games by a specific provider, then you go to the 'Game provider' filter and tick the relevant box. For NetEnt casinos for example, just select the box with its name next to it.</p>
<p>Note: You can also use filters to find casinos with a particular currency and withdrawal limit, among others, so take a minute to have a look around!</p>
<p>Revolut casino bonuses</p>
<p>If you're a fan of online casino bonuses, then the good news is that some Revolut sites have deposit bonuses or no deposit bonuses that they offer to new and existing players.</p>
<p>To find these, you can go to Casino Guru's list of casino bonuses and choose 'Revolut' there. These can be narrowed down to specific types, too, by clicking your preferred option, such as no deposit bonuses, in the 'Bonus type' section. Alternatively, go to our list of no deposit bonuses and choose the 'Revolut' box there.</p>
<p>Any bonus you find should be up-to-date and ready for you to use thanks to our team's hard work.</p>
