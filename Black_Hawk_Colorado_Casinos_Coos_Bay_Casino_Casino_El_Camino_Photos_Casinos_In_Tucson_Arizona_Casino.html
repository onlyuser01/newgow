<p>In a Thursday tweet, Joe Cunningham, the gubernatorial candidate for South Carolina, has expressed his support for sports betting. Talking to his followers, he stated that it is time for the industry to become legal and reap all of the benefits that come with it.</p>
<p>The Amount of Money Cannot Be Passed</p>
<p>In his tweet, Cunningham stated that legalizing sports betting in South Carolina is about “giving people more freedom” and generating revenue that can be used for various good purposes. Some of the areas that the money can be used are for fixing up the roads and schools.</p>
<p>According to Cunningham, over 30 US states, including all of South Carolina’s neighbors, have legalized sports betting and are able to enjoy the fruits that come with it. He stated that around $7 billion are likely to be wagered on the Super Bowl, but since South Carolina hasn’t legalized sports betting yet, it won’t receive any money from it.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that sports betting is currently illegal in South Carolina, bettors are likely participating in illegal activities, as Cunningham thinks. His point is that the residents are betting either way, but with a regulated industry, players will be protected and the money will go to various projects in the state.</p>
<p>South Carolina Does Not Have Any Legal Sports Betting Options Currently</p>
<p>At the moment, South Carolina laws deem sports betting illegal. That is why residents that want to place wagers on sports need to travel to the neighboring states. Not only that, but the South Carolina tribes have even made a push to open their gaming facilities in North Carolina, South Carolina’s neighboring state. The Catawba tribe got the green light at the end of 2021 to build a permanent casino.</p>
<p>The construction of Catawba Two-Kings Casino Resort began in July 2021, but it was stopped as a legal battle emerged. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians were fighting against, but the years-long dispute did not end in their favor.</p>
<p>If Cunningham’s plans succeed, South Carolina residents will be able to wager on sports legally, but a timeframe hasn’t been set yet. So far, there have only been two attempts to legalize wagering in the state in 2019. A joint effort by the House and the Senate called for legalizing all forms of commercial gambling, gambling, and betting included.</p>
<p>Then, a second effort, which included the creation of a gambling commission to study gambling, was made, but both of these failed after one reading in a committee. After the failed attempts in 2019, there weren’t any runs for sports betting to be legalized in South Carolina in 2020.</p>
