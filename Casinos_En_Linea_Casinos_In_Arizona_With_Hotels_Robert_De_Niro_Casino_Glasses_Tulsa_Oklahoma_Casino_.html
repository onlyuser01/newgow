    <h1>Casinos En Linea Casinos In Arizona With Hotels Robert De Niro Casino Glasses Tulsa Oklahoma Casino</h1>

<p>Hello Levi H and Joanna,</p>
<p>I'm sorry for the delay, we were consulting the case internally.</p>
<p>Purely from the legal perspective, the casino may be right. Hovewer, when making our ratings, we take many more factors into account. To pay out all winnings that are legitimate according to the T&amp;Cs is a necessary condition for having a good rating, but not a sufficient one. There are many more factors to consider. One of these factors is the overall user experience, including whether the casino is safe. In our view, a good user experience means that players don’t need to read the full T&amp;Cs (in fact nobody does that, maybe with the exception of some bonus hunters) and can rely that they’ll be treated fairly. In our view, safety means that it’s not easy to accidentally do something that will cancel your winnings.</p>
<p>Bonus maxbet is a standard rule, however many casual players don’t know about it. Because of this, we believe that the best thing to do is to enforce this condition using software. Only because this isn’t that easy for casinos to do, and almost no casino does this at the moment (we hope this will change in the future), we don’t penalize casinos for not having this feature. However, on the other hand, we expect the best casinos to individually look at every case where this rule may have been broken by an honest mistake.</p>
<p>The only reason for this rule’s existence is for casino to defend itself against bonus hunters. In this particular case, it’s clear that this rule was broken by accident and also that depositing with a balance of 63 cents doesn’t give the player any opportunity to abuse the bonus or get any other advantage over casino. So, this isn’t something that a bonus abuser would do. But it’s something that lots of casual players would do, unaware that it could have fatal effects on their future winnings. And we believe that the best casinos should create a safe environment for players and shouldn’t void their winnings because of honest mistakes like this.</p>
<p>If they do so, it may be justified from the legal perspective, but in our opinion, it’s not justified for casinos that care highly about their customers. Therefore, we ask Magical Spin Casino to look at this case from the player’s perspective and prove it cares also about player experience and not only about paragraphs.</p>
