    <h1>Casino Murder Case Harris Casino Lake Tahoe Northwood Casino Casino Metropolis Sweep Coin Casino Sta</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru Team,</p>
<p>I am writing to file a complaint against Stake, an online casino that I recently played on. I had a very unpleasant experience and I believe that they are taking advantage of problem gamblers.</p>
<p>Stake has been extremely dishonest and has not upheld responsible gaming checks and responsibilities required by law as i self excluded and was allowed to open several new accounts and continue gambling I have lost a significant amount of money due to their practices, and I would like to request a refund for the same.</p>
<p>It is unacceptable that they are ignoring responsibilities with regards to self-exclusions, KYC, AML, and CDD policies. As a problem gambler, it is difficult enough for me to control my gambling habits, and their actions have only made this more difficult.</p>
<p>I urge you to take immediate action to rectify this situation and prevent other vulnerable customers from falling into the same trap. It is imperative that they enforce self-exclusion policies as required by law and license and collect the necessary information to prevent excluded players from accessing their sire.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you could investigate my complaint and take appropriate action against Stake. I hope that this issue will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
<p>Dear Stake Casino,</p>
<p>I am writing to express my deep frustration and disappointment with your platform and the way you have ignored my self-exclusion requests. As a problem gambler, I have self-excluded from your site more than once in an attempt to control my gambling habits. However, it has become apparent that you are taking advantage of problem gamblers and failing to enforce self-exclusion policies as required by law and license.</p>
<p>As a crypto currency casino that holds an Antillephone Curacao Gaming license (8048/JAZ), you are obligated to perform the required KYC, CDD, and AML checks as mandated by law and license. However, it is clear that you are not upholding your responsibilities and are ignoring your duties to protect vulnerable customers like myself.</p>
<p>Despite my self-exclusion, I was able to create</p>
<p>more than one new account and deposit a significant amount of money and continue gambling. This should not have been possible, and it is clear that you are not taking the necessary steps to prevent excluded players from accessing your site.</p>
<p>I am seeking a refund due to your failure to collect the relevant information and prevent excluded players from opening new accounts and depositing or betting on your site. In total, my deposits are over $1500, which I should not have been able to deposit in the first place.</p>
<p>It is unacceptable that you are ignoring your responsibilities with regards to self-exclusions, KYC, AML, and CDD policies. As a problem gambler, it is difficult enough for me to control my gambling habits, and your actions have only made this more difficult.</p>
<p>I urge you to take immediate action to rectify this situation and prevent other vulnerable customers from falling into the same trap. It is imperative that you enforce self-exclusion policies as required by law and license and collect the necessary information to prevent excluded players from accessing your site.</p>
<p>I am deeply disappointed in the way you have ignored my self-exclusion requests and hope that you take the necessary steps to address this issue and provide a resolution.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mounir</p>
