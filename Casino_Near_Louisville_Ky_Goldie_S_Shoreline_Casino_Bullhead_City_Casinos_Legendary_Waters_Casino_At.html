<p>Pariplay Ltd, the innovative iGaming content provider and aggregator, known for its paradigm-shifting Fusion platform and Ignite studio development program, has taken another critical step towards its goal to penetrate the North American and Canadian markets. The supplier has elected Matthew Kelemen as its Business Development Director for the North American region.</p>
<p>Why Is Pariplay Interested in North America?</p>
<p>The area is essential for Pariplay given its continuous presence and gradual growth in all regulated gaming jurisdictions. The aggregator has also vocalized its long-term plans of turning into the number one iGaming supplier of content for the North American market by significantly increasing the reach of its successful Fusion aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Fusion is currently home to thousands of iconic titles from the hands of some of the most popular and reputable game developers in the industry. The platform also consists of a number of essential tools used for the conversion and retention of new players that are capable of significantly enhancing player value.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s Managing Director Adrian Bailey confessed the Gibraltar-founded company with 12 years of experience in the field has gained a lot of ground in both Canada and the United States in 2021. Bailey also added that Pariplay is “delighted” to further advance its footprint in the region by adding Kelemen to the team.</p>
<p>The Business-to-Business provider of Random Number Generator games is currently working together with the Canadian-based NeoPollard Interactive, an award-winning provider of iLottery solutions in North America. Pariplay also holds licenses in Michigan, New Jersey, and West Virginia. In December, Pariplay and Gaming Realms signed a deal that would allow the iGaming studio to benefit from the Fusion aggregation platform to reach new customers.</p>
<p>What Will Kelemen Add to the Team?</p>
<p>Kelemen is based out of Stratford, Connecticut. He has gathered over 23 years of experience working in the iGaming industry, where he held different positions, including senior roles at prestigious companies like RealTime Gaming and Boss Media, or Peak Interactive.</p>
<p>His primary duties job as Pariplay’s new Business Development Director for North America will require him to use his competence and expertise in the supplier’s targeted markets to further the supplier’s presence in the region. As part of its expansion plans and marking a strong start of the year, Pariplay signed a massive multi-state deal with Golden Nugget Online Gaming at the end of January.</p>
<p>Kelemen has also expressed his thrill to become one of the important Pariplay team members taking the “clear and extremely exciting” trip towards the company’s ultimate goal of becoming the leading iGaming provider on the continent.</p>
