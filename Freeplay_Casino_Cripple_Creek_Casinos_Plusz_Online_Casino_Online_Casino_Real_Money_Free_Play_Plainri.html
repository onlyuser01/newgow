<p>Evolution continues to build momentum across North America and the United States in particular. The premier developer of live casino content for the iGaming industry has announced the launch of a second dedicated Live Studio in New Jersey to meet demand and offer more opportunities to partner operators, with round-the-clock coverage.</p>
<p>The second studio is in fact the fifth such property that the firm has been able to establish in the United States, anticipating a resurgence of the iGaming market as such. Presently, Evolution is a licensed supplier in Michigan, West Virginia, Connecticut, and New Jersey, all of which have authorized live casino as one of the available products to gamble on.</p>
<p>Commenting on this release, Evolution CEO of North America Jacob Claesson said that this is another exciting landmark for the company in the region and that Evolution’s sole aim was to continue and provide excellent value to the iGaming market, offering operators the tools they need to engage and entertain players. These games and products are designed to help operators stay ahead, Claesson said.</p>
<p>The second studio comes more than four years after the company introduced its first property back in August 2018. All has been done with the blessing of the NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement, which cleared the supplier to go right ahead with the launch. Operators will now have the opportunity to access even more of the company’s distinct products, including a new Football Studio, which is the first version of the "top card game" that is available in North America.</p>
<p>The release of Football Studio also follows on the release of another ambitious project announced earlier in September with First Person, a series of games that give players a slightly more private online gaming setting that they can enjoy. Evolution, though, has even bigger plans for the market.</p>
<p>"More tables and games will be launching in the coming weeks and months as we continue to hire additional people, continuing to build our incredible team in North America and offer exciting new opportunities to both operators and players," Claesson said in the official press statement. In the meantime, the company has definitely not been sitting idle. In August, Evolution introduced Live Craps to the US market.</p>
