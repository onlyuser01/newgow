<p>Kansas City Chiefs Hoping for Their Third Straight Win</p>
<p>After a surprising loss to the Detroit Lions at Arrowhead in Week 1, the Kansas City Chiefs went on to win the following two games. First, they beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 17-9 on the road. Then, they destroyed the Chicago Bears 41-10 at home.</p>

<p>In both of those wins, Kansasâ€™ Patrick Mahomes-led offense was brilliant. The QB threw for two touchdowns against the Jags and three TDs against the Bears. The Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce recorded a TD in each of those games.</p>
<p>Further, the Chiefs did great running the ball as well, particularly in the game with Chicago. Running backs Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Isiah Pacheco scored a TD each. When it comes to Kansas Cityâ€™s defense, they did okay, especially in the game with Jacksonville. We saw them keep Trevor Lawrence and the Jags to zero touchdowns.</p>
<p>New York Jets Praying for a Miracle</p>
<p>The Jets won every single game against the Chiefs that took place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. However, the most recent of those happened in 2017 when Patrick Mahomes was still at college. Alex Smith was the Chiefsâ€™ QB that day, while the Jets signal-caller was Josh McCown.</p>
<p>Six years later, the Jets were supposed to have a real superstar in the QB role. The man in question is Aaron Rodgers who started in Week 1 but suffered a season-ending injury. Backup quarterback Zach Wilson took his place, helping the Jets beat the Buffalo Bills in their first game of the 2023 NFL season.</p>
<p>However, he didnâ€™t do much in the following two games, in each of which he and his offensive teammates scored just 10 points.</p>
<p>Chiefs vs. Jets Prediction</p>
<p>The Chiefs are way, way better than the Jets. We think theyâ€™d beat them even if Aaron Rodgers werenâ€™t injured. With Zach Wilson as the QB, the New Yorkers stand no chance against the visitors from Kansas City.</p>
