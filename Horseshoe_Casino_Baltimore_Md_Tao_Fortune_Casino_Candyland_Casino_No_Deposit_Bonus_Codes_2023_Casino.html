    <h1>Horseshoe Casino Baltimore Md Tao Fortune Casino Candyland Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Casino</h1>

<p>So I also have massive problems with the casino at the moment I was able to gamble away thousands of euros despite the ban and yes the account was closed due to gambling addiction and the management knew about my problem CasinoGuru does not publish my complaint or my rating I think CasinoGuru is very deep here is in it. Here is my review and story at the same time:</p>
<p>This casino or the two casinos Gama and Cat are one and the same act absolutely negligent, I was able to register as a blocked player in this casino even though the management itself caused the casino to be blocked due to gambling addiction, and that's how it went pretty quickly Thousands of yours landed in this casino but that wasn't enough I stole a colleague's credit card in my relapse and I was able to deposit at this casino with it without any problems now the colleague has of course reported it to the police I of course said there in which casino I got the money gambled away and the police were and are sure that this casino is obliged to reimburse the deposits, so I emailed the casino to ask them to primarily book back the deposits that took place with the stolen credit card, but instead of the casino cooperating here what it is Actually, according to their license, you should be taken for a fool here. They ask for receipts from my credit card, which was verified a long time ago, but they don't want to know anything about the stolen one because the gentlemen here are sure that they have to reimburse you. They try to delay the matter by keeping my data in the kyc loop for years when I asked for contact details, i.e. a telephone number that I can give the police officer who was processing, there was no reaction at all, you know here that what I did is also a legal problem for the casino, but okay If the ladies and gentlemen think it is too late, I will initiate a chargeback for my card and I will also recommend the police and my colleague to do the same for his because both parties here are entitled to get the money back I because I can be proven was blocked and my colleague either way because I stole his card and access data if Gama or Cat Casino think that they also want to pay the fees for the chargeback then please I have tried to clarify this matter peacefully</p>
