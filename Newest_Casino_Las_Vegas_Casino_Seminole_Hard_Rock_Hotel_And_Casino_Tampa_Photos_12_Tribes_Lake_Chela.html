    <h1>Newest Casino Las Vegas Casino Seminole Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tampa Photos 12 Tribes Lake Chela</h1>

<p>Dear CasinoGuru Team and Harsheet99,</p>
<p>We have double-checked the situation that happened and would like to share the result of the investigation.</p>
<p>Firstly, we never mentioned that the player made bets with violation to meet the wager requirement of any bonus, he played on his own funds.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a fact that the player repeatedly bet on red+black+0 in the same round. Harsheet99 has made 7 out of 16 bets with violation of Anti-Fraud Policy. Screenshots with bets' details were provided to the CasinoGuru team via email earlier.</p>
<p>Therefore, the player's account was suspended and the winnings were confiscated in accordance with our Anti-Fraud Policy, which states the following:</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS (https://goldenstar-casino.com/terms-and-conditions)</p>
<p>Anti-fraud Policy</p>
<p>(p. 2.1) "We use special techniques to combat fraud in order to prevent any type of financial fraud at the Casino. Any attempt of fraud will result in immediate suspension of the Gambler’s account with the right of confiscation of all the funds in favor of Сasino."</p>
<p>(p. 2.2) ''The player is not allowed to use any strategies playing any table games, such as roulette, card games and others. The Casino reserves the right to cancel all Player's winnings using such strategies.''</p>
<p>(p. 2.4) "The Company has a strict anti-fraud policy and utilises various anti-fraud tools and techniques. If the player is suspected of fraudulent actions including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>low risk roulette play where the player betting equal stakes for both black/red or even/odd covering 25 or more out of 37 numbers on the table (Placing bets on black/red only covers 36 of 37 possible numbers)."</p>
<p>Finally, the player has already been notified a few times about our investigation and action taken and requested all the necessary data and documents for the refund of deposited funds (a screenshot of the email was already shared with CasinoGuru team via email too).</p>
<p>We hope for your consideration of the aforementioned details and fairness in resolving this complaint as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact us in case of any additional questions!</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Golden Star Casino team</p>
