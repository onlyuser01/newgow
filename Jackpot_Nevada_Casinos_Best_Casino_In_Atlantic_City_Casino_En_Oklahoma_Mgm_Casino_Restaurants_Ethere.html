    <h1>Jackpot Nevada Casinos Best Casino In Atlantic City Casino En Oklahoma Mgm Casino Restaurants Ethere</h1>

<p>I joined Bitstarz several weeks ago. I deposited 10 Litecoin, and did not use the sign up bonus offers that were available, as I wanted to be able to easily withdrawal if I were to win.</p>
<p>I ended up winning a marginal amount compared to my deposit, and requested a withdrawal of $1500.</p>
<p>The requests started small. They wanted my drivers license, front and back and utility bill. They received those. They then told me that I needed to go out somewhere and find a newspaper, and sign and date the newspaper, and then also include that in the selfie with my ID. They received that. Then they told me that I needed to go out somewhere local, and send a picture of myself next to a recognized geographic location. They received that.</p>
<p>I also went above and beyond and sent them a video of myself with my ID in hand so that we could resolve whatever confusion there was. The next response I received was telling me that my documents were obviously edited, and therefore, the entirety of my account balance was being confiscated.</p>
<p>I was absolutely sure there was some mistake or something. The number of documents I had submitted, how could this be the response. Every subsequent attempt to contact bitstarz has resulted in a staff member telling me that the previous decision is final.</p>
<p>I have asked for specific information on what they believe to be edited. They have refused to offer specifics. And since they arent edited, they wont have a response to the matter.</p>
<p>If a casino can arbitrarily decide to confiscate account balances, and offer no explanation or evidence into the matter, there is a major problem. I did not abuse their bonuses. This was all winnings done off of legitimate deposits.</p>
<p>I am going to include the same documents they received, and Im hoping that either my withdrawal can be processed, or they can return the funds that I deposited.</p>
