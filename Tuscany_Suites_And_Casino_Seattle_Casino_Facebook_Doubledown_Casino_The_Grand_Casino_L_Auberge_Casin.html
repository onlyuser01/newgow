    <h1>Tuscany Suites And Casino Seattle Casino Facebook Doubledown Casino The Grand Casino L Auberge Casin</h1>

<p>Was told right from the start after being refer to play here by my dad and boyfriend, so we stay in one roof and they player it with the bonus no deposit and dont like the casino, well I liked the games and played the no deposit also, then I met the wager.... Was told by support they are going to delete my winnings and money all together because I cheated.... Dont know how but I was furious and raised hell on that person...... So next day I played it again and my money was still there so I kept on playing and I got fed up with what happen yesterday's commotion with support person so this time I asked them to not tell me anything else by what I want to know, still got the runaround and I put my winnings and more all together for a withdraw, in the terms it says they will take out what I can't keep so that's why I did that. I don't know what they mean by I'm a cheater and I won't get paid out.... Makes no sense to why if my boyfriend and dad was playing for fun on their site, with all the correct and true information like me and I'm a cheater? Because I like the games they say I cheat? Why am I called a cheat and told I have multiple accounts on their site by support? I called a lot of times and they don't answer.... Well I made a deposit of like a dollar in BTC so they have my BTC account on file.... Still all day not nonething..... Pending withdraw so let's see how it goes.... Cant get a hold of management.... Or anyone in charge andbim tired of being told 10,000 different things....</p>
