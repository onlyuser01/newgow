<p>The provisional license in New Jersey will allow Hacksaw Gaming to expand its US reach</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a leading provider of slots, scratchcards and instant win games, announced that it has secured a provisional license in the state of New Jersey. The supplier hopes to launch in the state by the end of the year, providing local companies with access to its premium content.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming’s initial foray into the US market was earlier this year when it entered West Virginia. The supplier later joined forces with the American gambling powerhouse DraftKings, powering its business in the state with its cutting-edge products.</p>
<p>The provisional license in New Jersey will allow Hacksaw Gaming to expand its US reach, and supply games to operators in a second state. According to the company, its products should be available in the Garden State by the end of the final quarter of the year.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming described the new license as a “further catalyst for growth” and noted that it would allow it to remain ahead of its competitors.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming’s growth continues to be underpinned by its partnership with Light &amp; Wonder and the latter company’s robust platform reach. According to the company, the diversification across states and the expansion of its footprint are in line with its broader strategy to reach wider audiences.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming Is Unstoppable, CEO Cordes Says</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive officer, Marcus Cordes, commented on the launch in New Jersey, praising the opportunity to reach more operators and players with Hacksaw’s content. He said that the company is “unstoppable” and poised for success in the United States.</p>
<p>We are ecstatic to see the rate at which we are broadening our horizons, and the headway we are making in getting the recognition our content deserves. There is no doubt that Hacksaw will thrive in the US. Marcus Cordes, CEO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>New Jersey isn’t Hacksaw Gaming’s only new market. A month ago, the company also entered the Colombian gaming market thanks to a major agreement with Betplay. In addition, Hacksaw Gaming has been bullish on expanding in Italy, as attested by recent agreements with NetBet and Europbet.</p>
<p>In September, the leading content provider also expanded its presence in the Balkans, launching content in Bulgaria with Inbet.</p>
