    <h1>Megastar Casino Wow Vegas Casino Online Tachi Palace Hotel Casino Nd Casinos Casino In Battle Creek</h1>

<p>I made a deposit of 25 dollars and got 50 bonus for being my first deposit. I lost the bonus balance and continue playing with my original deposit, which I turned in 325 dollars. I sent all the documentation required to verify my account, which was quickly accepted, and then I requested a withdraw. Hours later, I received an email saying my withdrawal was decline and that ALL MY WINNINGS WERE VOIDED. I only requested to withdraw 125 dollars via Bitcoin... I left the remaining 200 dollars in my account to continue playing. I attach the email I received:</p>
<p>Dear Agustin,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience regarding your withdrawal of $ 125.26 via Bitcoin.</p>
<p>While reviewing your account we've noticed that the following rule was broken:</p>
<p>A promotion cannot be used in conjunction with any other promotional offer or existing account balance. If you happen to redeem bonuses on top of an existing playable balance, any winnings will be voided and original deposit reimbursed in your account.</p>
<p>By redeeming coupons on top of your positive account balance you've broken the above stated rule. We have denied your withdrawal, voided your winnings and your bonus.</p>
<p>Please note your deposit of $ 25.00 has been credited back to your casino account to try your luck once more on our latest games.</p>
<p>Kindly have a look at the casino Terms and Conditions to avoid breaking any of our rules in the future which may result in your winnings being voided</p>
<p>Should you require any further information or assistance, please feel free to contact us.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Lucie</p>
