    <h1>Station Casino Jobs Tuscany Suites Casinos World S Biggest Casino Wow Vegas Casino Login Aquarius Ho</h1>

<p>I have been having a problem trying too receive my funds. I withdrew £550 to my card that was cancelled due too my new bank card arriving replacing my old card details, because off this I can not have my money funded in too my new card details due too not been able too send a pdf document too slotzo from my bank proving my old card has been cancelled. The reason for this is because starling bank does not produce this kind off document. My bank sent me a email that has the starling bank logo a reference number and the banks phone number attached and explains my card with last 4 has been cancelled and replaced with my new card plus the last 4. I was told that can not be accepted and they need a PDF document. This went on for days just asking me for this document. I was then asked if I can get a issued communication from my bank stating the bank does not produce the document that confirms my old card is now cancelled. I asked my bank and I was sent a email stating this. I have tried sending this, but when sending a message too slotzo on there site there ain't a option too attach files, but sent a message explaining all this, but no reply. I tried emailing this, but says failed too send. All my other emails i have sent to other non related stuff sends with no problems just fails when sending too slotzos email address. The only way I could send these attachments was on there live chat, but my account has now been closed so can't access live chat. I have also when my account was open uploaded my ID passport a photo off my new bank card which I made a £10 deposit then withdrew it, I got that withdrawl off £9 back £1 fee for withdrawls and also uploaded a pdf bank statement all where accepted. I have sent screenshots off the live chats with Starling Bank telling me they do not produce cancelled card documents the email is enough proof off a cancelled card and that's the reason they don't produce a pdf document. The only thing I haven't sent is a photo off my old bank card due too it being badly damaged.</p>
<p>I really do not know what else too do here apart from make a complaint and see if someone can help me. If slotzo potentially think this could be fraud or whatever slotzo should take the phone number from the email I have shown and phone the bank using the reference number that is also attached and phone the bank. I just need a help with this.</p>
<p>I have attached screenshots off the live chat with Starling Bank and a photo off a email from starling bank.</p>
