<p>The leading iGaming content provider, Yggdrasil, announced the launch of a new slot game in collaboration with the omnichannel supplier of gambling games and machines, Reflex Gaming. The duo confirmed Monday the launch of Bugs Money, a new slot that offers quality graphics, thrilling features and a colorful design.</p>
<p>The new title marks the latest game that is a part of the YG Masters portfolio. Bugs Money reaffirms the strength of the partnership between Reflex Gaming and Yggdrasil as it marks the 13th such title within the YG Masters initiative.</p>
<p>Powered by Yggdrasil's state-of-the-art technology called GATI, the new game can be easily launched with different operators and jurisdictions. This is because the innovative technology enables operators to leverage a regulation-ready, preconfigured and standardized development toolkit that allows fast distribution.</p>
<p>Mat Ingram, Reflex Gaming's CPO, shared his excitement about the announcement in a statement saying: "This game has been a lot of fun to create. Itâ€™s another original concept from our studio." He explained that Bugs Money can quickly turn volatile and escape the "tranquil setting."</p>
<p>Moreover, Ingram pointed out that the Free Spins add to the thrill further by increasing the volatility and delivering a super volatile mode. Finally, he said: "Allowing players to set their own volatility in the Free Spins feature offers greater engagement and ensures the title appeals to a wide demographic."</p>
<p>Yggdrasil's Head of Product and Programs, Stuart McCarthy, was also excited and noted: "Bugs Money is a playful, fun and vibrant title with straightforward yet engaging gameplay." In conclusion, he explained: "Our partnership with Reflex Gaming has been fantastic to date with over 10 titles launched and we are excited to introduce yet another premium game to our wide operator network."</p>
<p>Bugs Money is described by Yggdrasil as a title that offers a colorful design in combination with engaging features such as Free Spins as well as Glow Wilds reel modifiers.</p>
<p>To trigger the Free Spins feature, players need to land three or more scatter symbols. Activating the feature enables the players to select 3, 7, 10 or 15 Free Spins. The maximum multiplier varies depending on the number of spins and can be 50x, 20x 10x and 5x respectively.</p>
<p>According to Yggdrasil, this feature "allows players to directly set the volatility of the Free Spins feature and encourages user participation." While players are into the bonus round, a Queen Bee symbol can appear on the center reel. This can increase the multiplier by 10x, creating potential for huge wins that can be up to 500x.</p>
<p>Besides Free Spins, Bugs Money offers a Glow Wilds reel modifier bonus. Whenever this bonus feature is activated, either during Free Spins or base game, the game settings change from day to night and upon spinning of reels, glow bugs can land on random positions, adding wild symbols. During this round, the Queen Bee can also appear, granting a chance for big wins.</p>
