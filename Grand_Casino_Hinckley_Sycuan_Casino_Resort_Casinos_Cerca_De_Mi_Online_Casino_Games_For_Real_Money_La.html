    <h1>Grand Casino Hinckley Sycuan Casino Resort Casinos Cerca De Mi Online Casino Games For Real Money La</h1>

<p>Hi patronela</p>
<p>What do you mean fully verified? When I signed up with them I gave them all of my personal details(address, phone number, full name and date of birth)and was approved for an account and was able to deposit with my debit card 5 or 6 time and via Bitcoin once. They didnt ask for any further information from me. They approved.y deposits quickly and easily and immediately. Only when i won $3k did they ban my account and block me from being able to sign in(and subsequently refuse to let me have my winnings as well)</p>
<p>Also, they have a thanksgiving promo going on that is based on points earned and i was in it to win it! I was rapid betting $10 a spin as fast as I could press the button to build up points to win that contest...and was climbing the leader board rapidly and was going too win the 15k dollars now doubt. That was the whole reaosn why i was depositing so much money in such a short time because I was looking at potentially winning 15k in the contest! But theres no hope of that. I know this and it makes me sick but no one has any power over these people. They take and take and take then cant even pay a small win. Its sickening.</p>
<p>As for the chargeback question- I had a bunch of unauthorized charges on a credit card awhile back and my bank did the full investigation and ruled in my favor and returned the funds that were taken. The charges definitely weren't from online casinos. They were random pos shopping charges.</p>
<p>Thay said, it holds absolutely NO relevance towards what this casinonis doing to me. I just signed up with them and I just started depositing with them. I just looked at my bank account just now and the charges havent even fully posted yet---and a charge must be posted before its can be disputed lol! So what they are claiming wouldn't even be possible! Not by me...not by anyone!</p>
<p>As for supporting documents....what are u refering to? Would you like me to upload a bank statement showing the charges and the signed state</p>
<p>ment from my bank president on my behalf?</p>
<p>I will send your whatever you request but it shouldnt make any difference because the facts are the facts</p>
