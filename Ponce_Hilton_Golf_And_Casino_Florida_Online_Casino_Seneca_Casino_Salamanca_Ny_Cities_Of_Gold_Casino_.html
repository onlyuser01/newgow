<p>The Detroit Lions vs. Dallas Cowboys is the Saturday Night Football game of Week 17. It’s on the program on December 30, 2023, at AT&amp;T Stadium, with a live broadcast on ABC</p>
<p>Both teams have been sensational in the 2023 NFL season, but it’s the Detroit Lions who have been in better form. They won their last two games, while the Cowboys lost their previous two. Still, to be fair to the boys from Texas, they played against two really tough opponents, each time away from home.</p>
<p>Now, the Cowboys are playing in front of their fans at AT&amp;T Stadium where they’re 7-0 in 2023. Will they stay undefeated at home after the Week 17 clash with the Lions? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Detroit Lions Want to Keep Playing Great</p>
<p>The Lions are 11-4 in the 2023 NFL and have already clinched the NFC North. They will play in the Playoffs no matter what happens in the remainder of the regular season.</p>
<p>However, they also have a chance to win the No. 1 seed in the National Football Conference (NFC), which would mean skipping the first round of the postseason.</p>

<p>For that to happen, they need a little bit of luck, that is, to see their NFC rivals fail (primarily the San Francisco 49ers). They also need to win their two remaining games.</p>
<p>Beating the Minnesota Vikings at home in the final round of the regular season seems like an easy job, but the same doesn’t apply to the Week 17 game with the Cowboys.</p>
<p>They’ve got a very poor history against this opponent, losing each of their last five meetings. Further, they are without a win at AT&amp;T Stadium (formerly known as Cowboys Stadium) since 2011.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys to End Their Losing Run</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are 10-5 in the 2023 season, but we saw them lose their last two games. This, however, doesn’t mean they’re in a crisis. On the contrary. The reason why they lost those two is that they played against two really tough opponents – the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>The Cowboys played both of those games on the road, but they’re coming back to AT&amp;T Stadium in Week 17. That’s where they’ve got all wins in the 2023 season. Will they add another one? Well, you can be 100% certain that they’re planning to do so.</p>
<p>They need a win to get back in the race for the NFC East title. They currently have one win fewer than the Philadelphia Eagles who are at the top of the division. However, they could get back to the No. 1 spot if they win their remaining two games.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions vs. Dallas Cowboys Prediction</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are our pick for the Saturday game of Week 17. Their offense is second overall in the NFL while sitting in the No. 1 spot when it comes to home games. This is why we think they’re going to run riot on the Detroit Lions’ defense. But what about the other way around?</p>
<p>Even though Jared Goff &amp; Co. have been brilliant so far, we doubt they can produce much against Dallas’ defensive team, which is fifth-best in the league.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Cowboys -6.0</p>
