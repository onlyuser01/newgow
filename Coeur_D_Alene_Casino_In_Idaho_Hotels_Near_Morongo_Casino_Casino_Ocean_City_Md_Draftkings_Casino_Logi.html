    <h1>Coeur D Alene Casino In Idaho Hotels Near Morongo Casino Casino Ocean City Md Draftkings Casino Logi</h1>

<p>Dear brownemunde5,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>Could you please advise which documents you have already provided and when exactly did you send the last one?</p>
<p>Have you provided all the required documents as soon as possible and in the correct format?</p>
<p>Have you received any explanation from the casino as to why your account was blocked?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
