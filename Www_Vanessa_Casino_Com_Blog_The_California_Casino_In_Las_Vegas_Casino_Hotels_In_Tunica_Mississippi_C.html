<p>Catena Media is expanding its reach in the regulated gambling market in the United States. The company will be part of the sports betting launch for Kansas which recently regulated its sports wagering industry and is preparing to launch on time for the National Football League season.</p>
<p>Catena Outlines Plans for the Sunflower State</p>
<p>The official date for the upcoming NFL season is set for September 8, although operators will already be accepting wagers on September 1 with the permission of authorities. Catena, too, is looking to set up its affiliate services in the Sunflower State, as it continues to grow business and scale operations in the United States.</p>
<p>Catena is confident that its experience in the regulated gambling markets puts it in a strong position to continue delivering on a strong overall product and offer. The company is one of the best data and research-driven affiliate agencies in US gambling.</p>
<p>Speaking about the imminent launch in Kansas, the company outlined broad strokes for other upcoming developments in Massachusetts and Maryland set to debut in 2023, along with Ohio. Catena’s main drivers of content and information creation are Legal Sports Report and The Lines which have proven highly informative and worthwhile assets to consumers.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, Catena Media VP for the content of North America, Dustin Gouker, said that he had big expectations from the upcoming launch and referred to the company’s pole position:</p>
<p>Our strong portfolio of national and regional sites puts us in a solid position ahead of the huge customer acquisition period we see when any new state launches sports betting. Catena Media VP for the content of North America, Dustin Gouker</p>
<p>Gouker confirmed that the company is excited to dive into this new opportunity. Catena published its financial results just recently, noting a slowdown in overall revenue with a 5% drop. Regardless, the company remains one of the most prominent players on the market and can deliver excellent content and added value for sports fans, readers, and casual sports audiences.</p>
<p>The company announced plans to scale down European operations to prioritize its US market. Recently, Catena joined NJ.com to deliver its content locally in the Garden State and reinforce its position in the state.</p>
