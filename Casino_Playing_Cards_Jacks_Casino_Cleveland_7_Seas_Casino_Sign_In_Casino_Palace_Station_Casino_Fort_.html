<p>History isn’t sure, but SportsBetting.ag was officially launched either in 2002 and 2003. Since then, the sportsbook has been gaining momentum, making headlines for all the right reasons, and bringing US bettors and sports fans many cherished moments to remember. In today’s SportsBetting review, we take a look at this betting website’s journey to the top.</p>
<p>We will talk about the available sports markets you can bet on, drop a few hints about the payouts and maximum amounts you can win based on specific wagers, and give you a good read of what makes SportsBetting the leading online betting website in the USA.</p>
<p>Available Sports to Bet On</p>
<p>The sports you can bet on include over 32 sports, which range from traditional betting markets, such as the NFL, Hockey, Basketball, Baseball, College Football and College Basketball to Golf, Horse Racing, Motorsports, and others.</p>
<p>Every sport has its own dynamic and you can expect to find different league, tournaments and competitions available at different times of the year. You will be able to pick from a rich field of contests and often have a flexible bet to place. Here are all the sports you can bet on:</p>
<p>NFL Entertainment Auto Racing Financials Baseball Horse Racing Basketball Lottery Football Martial Arts Golf Politics Hockey Rugby League Soccer Rugby Union Sports Sims Snooker Table Tennis Wrestling Tennis Chess Aussie Rules Handball Boxing Futsal Cricket Lacrosse Cycling Volleyball Darts Esports</p>
<p>The betting field is very diverse. Each main market has dozens, and potentially hundreds of available competitions to bet on. The exact number of active contests can easily exceed 30,000 events you can bet on.</p>
<p>Some notable alternative betting markets here include Sports Sims, Politics, Entertainment, and even Esports, providing you with a vast field of competitions to bet on.</p>
<p>User Interface</p>
<p>The SportsBetting user interface (UI) is quick and intuitive. You will be able to access the online betting section by heading directly to navigation and clicking on /sports. Once you do, this will bring the entire betting panel, including the Events Panel, Main Betting Window, and Bet Slip. Just above the main panel, you will find a number of quick links for your benefit, which include:</p>
<p>Sportsbook</p>
<p>Getting Started</p>
<p>Promotions</p>
<p>Sports News</p>
<p>The time zone and date will be set to Eastern time, which is helpful when planning to bet on markets you are not entirely familiar with, such as European Table Tennis for example. All available contests are available in collapsible menus, so you can quickly remove any sports or events you are not interested in.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the betting slip will allow you to keep track of all bets you place. If you are not sure where to start, just go to the sports archetype you want to bet on, for example, Soccer. Once you click, the dropdown menu will display all Top Leagues, which include:</p>
<p>EPL</p>
<p>La Liga</p>
<p>Serie A</p>
<p>Ligue 1</p>
<p>Bundesliga &amp; others</p>
<p>Each event will have its own set of events to pick from. For example, if you click on Baseball, you will find a variety of available markets to study, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>MLB</p>
<p>MLB Futures</p>
<p>MLB Player Futures</p>
<p>Chinese Taipei</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>Baseball – Futures</p>
<p>South Korea</p>
<p>Baseball Props</p>
<p>MLB – World Series</p>
<p>MLB Season Specials</p>
<p>This seems like a lot to take in, but you don’t have to worry about information overload, as you can always collapse the menus and just choose the individual markets you would be the most interested in.</p>
<p>What Types of Bets Does the Sportsbook Offer?</p>
<p>There are always several types of bets that will be available. With thousands of betting contests available at SportsBetting.ag, it’s not exactly a surprise that having even more filters and options is always a handy feature. Each bet type is set to offer you a different return, we have calculated for you, but first let’s take a look at the main ones. They include:</p>
<p>Moneylines</p>
<p>Spread</p>
<p>Team Points</p>
<p>Totals</p>
<p>Futures</p>
<p>The offer extends to other types of bets as well. For instance, you can rely on various Parlays, Teasers, NFL Pleasers, and a variety of Proposition Bets. Each bet type is worthwhile on the condition that you understand the betting conditions and feel confident you can turn a profit.</p>
<p>We will now give you an example of how powerful certain types of bets are. For example, Parlays, especially when you successfully combine multiple selections and guess them correctly.</p>
<p>Selections Payout 2 teams +264 3 teams +600 4 teams +1228 5 teams +2435 6 teams +4741 7 teams +9142 8 teams 175-1 9 teams 335-1 10 teams 642-1 11 teams 1226-1 12 teams 2342-1 13 teams 4473-1 14 teams 8541-1 15 teams 16,306-1</p>
<p>Proposition bets are a world of their own, and pinpointing them down to a T would be difficult. A proposition bet can be any bet, really.</p>
<p>They are usually listed as Props on the website and you will find them under the main betting events. Very often, they are summed up in categories to make your life easier.</p>
<p>Props Categories</p>
<p>The main Props categories are:</p>
<p>Player Props</p>
<p>Game Props</p>
<p>By clicking on either, you can see the whole lot of available options you can bet on. At the time of the review, there were tons of available props. Here are some quick ones we summed up for you, but they are by no means the only props.</p>
<p>Soccer</p>
<p>Cards</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>Tackles</p>
<p>Assists</p>
<p>Passes &amp; more</p>
<p>NASCAR</p>
<p>Winning Manufacturer</p>
<p>Winning Team</p>
<p>Best Finish in Group 1</p>
<p>Best Finish: Rookies</p>
<p>Best Finish: Stewart-Haas Racing</p>
<p>Live Betting</p>
<p>SportsBetting.ag invites sports fans who value the thrill of the moment to place a wager on the available in-play markets on the website. To find the live markets, you can hop to the “Live Betting” section from navigation, which will bring you to a separate part of the website, tailored for following events in real-time and placing quick wagers.</p>
<p>The sportsbook allows you to pick from Event View, Multi View, My Wagers, Calendar, and more importantly Rules, where you can familiarize yourself with how the live betting campaign works precisely.</p>

<p>7% Horse Rebates</p>
<p>The $25 Horse Free Play bonus works like any other risk-free wager at SportsBetting. You make a bet and if it fails, the casino will reimburse you up to $25. As to the 7% Horse Rebates, the bonus is an opportunity to minimize your losses and enjoy a little more in the way of bankroll.</p>
<p>Sportsbook Bonuses</p>
<p>Mobile Betting $50 Free Play</p>
<p>Win or lose, you are in for a treat. All mobile bets worth up to $50 will be reimbursed immediately if they lose. This means that you can risk as much as $50 as soon as you enter and bet from a mobile device. Here is how it works</p>
<p>Place a bet from your mobile device</p>
<p>Win and collect your winnings</p>
<p>Lose and contact customer support</p>

<p>20% Esports Rebate</p>
<p>Apparently, esports is huge at SportsBetting.ag. This could mean only one thing, bonuses. And right as rain, the sportsbook delivers with the 20% Esports Rebate. What this means is that you get back 20% of your losses and up to $250. Now, the only drawback is that you would have to use your Esports Rebate on casino games instead of other sports bets.</p>
<p>SportsBetting Casino</p>
<p>If you would rather wind down with a quick and casual casino gaming, you will find the SportsBetting Casino to be spot on. The website offers a selection of Slot, Table, and Video Poker Games, not to mention the Live Dealer Section for having a shot at a Las Vegas-like experience without ever leaving the house.</p>
<p>SportsBetting Poker</p>
<p>While SportsBetting’s card room isn’t the biggest, it still offers busy tables. Players who are looking to play low-stake games will be very happy to try and the website runs various Sit &amp; Go’s. There are some $100,000 in guaranteed tournament prizes at weekends, which is still a bit of a minnow, but a good way to add variety to your sports betting.</p>
<p>Restricted Countries and Who Can Play</p>
<p>SportsBetting.ag accepts players from all 50 states in the USA, offering a competitive betting offer and a true alternative to many local sportsbooks. However, players from the following countries wouldn’t be able to access the website:</p>
<p>Australia</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>Malta</p>
<p>Panama</p>
<p>United Kingdom</p>
