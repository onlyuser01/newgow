<p>Fat Drac review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fat Drac is themed around the immortal story of Dracula.</p>
<p>On a moonlit night, players will make their way towards a mysterious castle. Haunting characters and spooky artifacts await as players aim to best the legendary vampire.</p>
<p>This slot is a fun choice for players who enjoy occult-themed slots and, of course, fans of vampire lore.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a haunting melody with an eerily festive tone. Players will feel they have stepped into an extravagant party with just a hint of the macabre.</p>
<p>The animation style has a whimsical flair and may bring to mind films such as The Nightmare Before Christmas. The reels are filled with dashing skeletons, stern gentlemen, and ornate goblets. Other symbols include stylised card suits cut with ornate designs.</p>
<p>The Fat Drac symbol shows a stout and fierce dracula with the blue-ish complexion of the undead. An adorable bat also makes an appearance, hanging from a golden beam.</p>
<p>The setting is a spooky nightscape with a majestic castle waiting in the distance. The windows glow softly as if luring players to join the ghoulish party.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fat Drac is a five reel, five row slot with 40 win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay is smooth and quick, ensuring players stay engaged.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Fat Drac symbol and the Goblet symbol.</p>
<p>Upon landing, the Fat Drac symbol can reveal any paying symbol or a Bat symbol.</p>
<p>When the Bat symbol appears, it prompts an Instant Prize to be awarded to the player. A total of seven possible Instant prizes are kept beside the reels to be won. These prizes shift during each spin.</p>
<p>At random, the Fat Bat feature may be triggered. During this feature, the Fat Bat gathers all the available Instant Prizes and awards the total amount to the player.</p>
<p>When the Coffin symbol lands, players are presented with 4 tiles to choose from. While in the base game, players may be awarded Goblet symbols or Bat symbols when they choose. During the Free Spins feature, players may also be awarded between +1 and +5 additional free spins.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when a Fat Drac symbol lands along with one or more Goblet symbols.</p>
<p>Throughout the Free Spins feature, the Fat Drac symbol will remain on the reels. When Goblet symbols land, the Fat Drac symbol will gather them to be added to a meter. As players fill this meter, the Fat Drac symbol will grow in size and extra free spins will be awarded.</p>
