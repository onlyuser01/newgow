<p>Dabble, a platform that focuses on social sports betting experiences in Australia, has teamed up with PandaScore, one of the preeminent companies that develops and deploys esports betting and gaming solutions, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release. PandaScore will now work with the social betting platform to launch the latter’s first esports betting offer in the Down Under.</p>
<p>Both companies are hailed as innovators in their respective sectors and they are bringing their respective products together to create brand new experiences for esports fans and Dabble customers. Esports has been fast-evolving around the world, with betting markets on numerous games now available as part of the commercial and social sportsbook landscape.</p>
<p>Dabble will be tapping into PandaScore’s feeds that cover hundreds of pre-match games from a number of competitive titles, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, possibly to soon be replaced with Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, League of Legends, and others.</p>
<p>PandaScore provides its odds round-the-clock to empower Dabble and its customers to place a social wager as they see fit. Commenting on this brand new opportunity, PandaScore Senior Sales Manager Dasha Kirilishina welcomed this opportunity to work with Dabble and offer esports fans new opportunities to experience their favorite products.</p>
<p>Dabble, Kirilishina said, is a company known for its love for innovation, touting PandaScore’s own advantages as well:</p>
<p>"We offer the most comprehensive esports odds, powered by the best data in the business. We combine this with our team of expert traders to ensure partners such as Dabble can offer the best value and experiences to their players."</p>
<p>Not least, Kirilishina said that the partnership is welcomed by her company as a collaboration that will bring benefits to the people who love or want to bet on esports, as well as the two companies. Dabble CEO Tom Rundle was similarly excited about the opportunity.</p>
<p>He said that Dabble has long been looking to expand into the social esports betting experience, and the addition of PandaScore was the right partner to achieve this. According to Rundle, esports fans in Australia stand to benefit from an unrivalled betting experience.</p>
<p>PandaScore has been one of the most prominent esports odds solutions and tech providers. The company’s feeds are so reliable and trustworthy that companies such as Betfred and William Hill have decided to work with PandaScore.</p>
