    <h1>Ameristar Hotel Casino Casino In Ga Windstar Casino In Okla Seminole Casino Coconut Creek L Auberge</h1>

<p>Dear Roger,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the terms and conditions, and I found this:</p>
<p>"9.1.2.2. Bonus Betting Rules:</p>
<p>· Placing wagers that are 30% or more then the value of the bonus (the smallest one among them) currently in play within the bonus wagering requirements are fulfilled.</p>
<p>· Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the smallest Cashback Bonus currently in play."</p>
<p>Our position closely explained in Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#max-bets: The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>However, if software enforcement of maximum allowed bet is not possible, each case is judged individually, so that only players who have broken the rule knowingly and systematically to gain an advantage aren’t paid out.</p>
<p>Roger, please could you forward me your game history from the bonus play? My email address is kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
