<p>The industry-leading iGaming software provider, offering innovative solutions that power land-based, mobile and online gambling operators across the globe, Digitain, announced a new European-facing partnership. The company's efforts this time are focused on the regulated gambling sector in Portugal after joining forces with LeBull.pt, a leading gaming brand in the country.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new partnership, announced Thursday, Digitain agreed to deliver its award-winning sportsbook platform. Moreover, under the terms of the new agreement, LeBull.pt will benefit from the company's sportsbook services as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the new collaboration seeks to strengthen the Portuguese gaming brand. At the same time, the strategic collaboration plays an important role in Digitain's growth on the Old Continent, allowing the company to expand its foothold.</p>
<p>Tiago Pereira, LeBull Portugal's Head, was excited about the freshly minted agreement with Digitain. "Digitain has been our compass from day one, helping LeBull.pt navigate the maze that is offering sportsbook in a highly regulated market like Portugal," he explained in a statement. Pereira outlined that Digitain offers supreme services and quality support, making it a perfect partner for LeBull.</p>
<p>"Portugal provides a lot of opportunities to create market share and growth in comparison to other regulated European countries," he added. Finally, Pereira said that LeBull is looking forward to the success the new partnership will bring and the growth the company will experience in Portugal, powered by Digitain.</p>
<p>Vardges Vardanyan, Digitain's Founder, was similarly thrilled regarding the new deal with LeBull. "Portugal is a growing regulated market, and we are delighted to work with the management of LeBull. We share the same vision in bringing new player experiences into the Portuguese market," he explained.</p>
<p>Finally, Vardanyan pointed out: "We, therefore, look forward to supporting and growing the LeBull brand together over what is an exciting time with our award-winning sportsbook platform technology and services."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Digitain announced a new partnership with BETER. Back in July, the company confirmed it will power BETER's ESportsBattle tournaments, as well as Setka Cup table tennis tournaments.</p>
<p>Before that, in June, Digitain hired Martin Martirosyan for the role of Group Deputy CEO. The C-suite appointment sought to strengthen the company's leadership team by bringing a seasoned veteran with significant experience. Throughout his career, Martirosyan accumulated significant knowledge and skills. Joining Digitain as its Group Deputy CEO, he said that he plans to propel the company's growth in strategic markets across Europe and beyond.</p>
