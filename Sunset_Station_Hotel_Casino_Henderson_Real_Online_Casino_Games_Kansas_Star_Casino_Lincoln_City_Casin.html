    <h1>Sunset Station Hotel Casino Henderson Real Online Casino Games Kansas Star Casino Lincoln City Casin</h1>

<p>So I went through the entire complaint, the evidence you provided, and many of your past complaints you submitted here to get the best idea about your behavior and I would like to summarize it for you.</p>
<p>You opened accounts in various casinos of this brand using different email addresses, which is usually the first personal detail casinos use to detect other accounts created by the same user. Moreover, you have not provided the direct request to self-exclude from all casinos owned by Versus Odds B.V. including all your email addresses. I only see that they informed you that some of your accounts and email addresses were blocked and that you were successfully self-excluded from a few of their casinos, which by the way, doesn't guarantee that all associated casinos will block your accounts immediately. Especially when you deliberately use multiple email addresses to overcome the casino's blocking system.</p>
<p>This is not the first casino you tried to close your account in due to gambling problems and this is not your first complaint, so you should be well aware of how we evaluate cases like this and that you must keep in mind that we cannot help without proper self-exclusion request. Also, you cannot expect that Curacaco-licensed casinos will automatically block your accounts in all sister casinos. You can expect treatment like this in casinos licensed by, for example, MGA. This and much more have been explained in various complaints you submitted to our website. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/betitall-casino-player-requests-a-refund-after-self-exclusion</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/thor-casino-the-player-s-requesting-a-refund-of-his</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/art-casino-the-player-s-requesting-a-refund-of-his</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/lapilanders-casino-player-s-requesting-a-full-deposit-1</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/gambola-casino-player-s-requesting-a-full-deposit</p>
<p>and many more.</p>
<p>So considering all of the above and that you didn't request self-exclusion from this specific casino prior to making deposits plus your account is now closed, there is not much we can do for you and we don't think you are entitled to a refund. I can only recommend that you always request self-exclusion from each specific casino and do not expect that casinos are the only subjects responsible for your actions. When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, the best way to self-exclude is via email. Email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence if itâ€™s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible. With such a request you also have a better chance to refund any deposits made after this request.</p>
<p>I apologize, but considering the information above and your previous complaints we are not able to proceed further with this case and I am forced to close it. If you do not agree with our decision, you can always try contacting the licensing authority, but I don't think they will have a different opinion.</p>
<p>And lastly, I would highly recommend finding an institution to help you with your addiction (https://casino.guru/problem-gambling-help-centers), otherwise, at this point, it looks like pure speculation and abuse of the self-exclusion system in online casinos.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding, I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
