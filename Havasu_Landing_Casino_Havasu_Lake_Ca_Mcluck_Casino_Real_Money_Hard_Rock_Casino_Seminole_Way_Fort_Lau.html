<p>Gov. Hochul stated that the process is starting anew, with a promise of increased communication, as her team actively seeks to reach an agreement that benefits all parties</p>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York has stressed yet again her detachment from the ongoing negotiations between her office and the Seneca Nation concerning a potential casino in the Rochester area. However, she emphasized that she is not directly participating in the negotiations, the timing decisions, or engaging in discussions with external individuals regarding this matter at the moment.</p>
<p>Local Leaders Surprised by Casino Deal Talks Involving Gov. Hochul’s Office</p>
<p>Speaking during the grand reopening ceremony at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, Gov. Hochul clarified that she had recused herself from the negotiations and would be informed of the details alongside the public, reported 13WHAM ABC.</p>
<p>The negotiations have sparked controversy and raised eyebrows among local leaders and lawmakers, who were surprised to learn about the talks involving a casino deal. The governor’s office has been handling the compact talks on behalf of Gov. Hochul due to her recusal from matters related to Delaware North, the company where her husband is employed as the senior vice president and general counsel.</p>
<p>The previous announcement of a new tribal gaming agreement between the governor’s office and the Seneca Nation, which potentially included a Las Vegas-style resort casino in Rochester, sparked criticism for not involving relevant state lawmakers and local officials in the negotiations.</p>
<p>Governor Hochul Allegedly Stalling Compact Renewal for Corporate Benefit</p>
<p>Following the refusal of the New York Assembly to pass a statute authorizing Gov. Hochul to sign the Seneca contract, the Seneca Nation’s President, Rickey Armstrong Sr., accused the governor of deliberately stalling the compact renewal, which could benefit Delaware North.</p>
<p>Despite the setback, Gov. Hochul assured that discussions with the Seneca Nation are still ongoing. She emphasized her commitment to seeking a good outcome for all parties involved and working with an outstanding team on the matter.</p>
<p>As negotiations continue, lawmakers from Rochester have expressed their concerns regarding the potential impact of a casino project in the area. The Greater Rochester Majority Delegation has been engaging with all relevant parties, including the Governor’s office, local stakeholders, and the Mayor’s office, to ensure that any agreement between the Seneca Nation and New York State is transparent and well-informed.</p>
<p>In May, the Seneca Nation sought public support for a fair gaming compact as their current agreement with New York State is set to expire in December. They organized community support events throughout May, encouraging people to sign letters to state leaders, urging them to expedite the negotiation process and sign a new deal before the end of the State Legislature session on June 8. The Nation emphasizes its positive economic impact in the region, with three casino properties employing around 3,000 people and providing significant indirect support to the local economy.</p>
