    <h1>Suncoast Hotel And Casino Casino Royal Ala Casino Harrah S Casino New Orleans Pit River Casino Grand</h1>

<p>So after depositing a lil under 200.00 usd I picked a promo bonus code and started playing was up to 2000 then after awhile I lost it all back...no surprise. So during my play I finally made it past the first level member.. so long so long to get to level 2. Anyways after losing all my money I decided to use my loyalty points well after losing that I went to chat with support, Luke was the one that I was speaking to. So I told him that I wanted to close my account because I have put a lot of money into the casino and I haven't won anything yet so please close my account. Well Luke in doing his job asked what the reason was so I told him and then he asked a few more thing can't recall long story short when he felt I was not backing out of closing my acct. He said "what if I gave you a bonus for one last time" and I'm sure that's what he's is told to do. And because I'm a gambler I asked him " for how much" and he said "150" and I thought about it and before I could say yes he had said " that my account was credited and good luck. " So I'm like ok and went and played. Well luck was on my side or Luke pushed a button long story short I ended up winning a lil over 2900.00. so I went to the cashier to see how much I had played on the play thru.. well to my surprise all but the 150 he gave to not close my account was in the cash portion. So I went to withdraw the money all happy I didn't withdraw everything just 2500 after forfeiting the 150 has normal when you withdraw and winning money on a bonus. Well today I went to see if the withdraw was complete due to Mondays and Thursdays are the only days they do withdraws and noticed that they had reversed my withdraw due to "correction" by administration. So I go-to chat support. Even longer story short. They said that bcuz I had used my loyalty points bonus and not had a deposit in-between my last and one and the 150 that I was given to not close my account that I was not entitled to it. So I spoke to a supervisor and told him the situation how I was trying to close my account and how Luke had given me that 150 to stay and now that I want some money they're trying to keep it well long story short he the this issue is not with VIP and finances team quote unquote and they're going to review it without me and make a decision which wow crazy to think that the whole time I was trying to close my account and they gave me money to stay and I end up winning but they don't want to give me the money I didn't give myself the bonus I didn't punch anything bonus codes to get that bonus I use my loyalty points because they called loyalty points cuz I was a true loyal to the site right but now I get no money.. so I got to wait 24 to 48 hours to find out what the decision is and should I don't think everybody knows what this they're going to decide right.</p>
