<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>Dear Richard,</p>
<p>These are the selected parts of the rules that I found in the casino's Terms &amp; Conditions (available HERE):</p>
<p>"The Casino reserves the right to disqualify winnings in case the following events occur:</p>
<p>Player has more than one active account at the Casino (unless given prior approval by direction)</p>
<p>Wrong or false registration information.</p>
<p>MOREOVER, SILVEREDGECASINO.COM SHALL:</p>
<p>Only register a single account in the name of a particular person: multi-account practices are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Not make a payment in excess of two thousand (US$2,000) out of a User Account to a Player until the Player's identity, age and place of residence have been verified.</p>
<p>If it becomes aware that a person has provided false information when providing due diligence documents, not register such person. Where that person has already been registered, Silveredgecasino.com shall immediately cancel that person's registration as a Player with the company."</p>
<p>And, these are selected rules from the casino's Bonus Terms (available HERE):</p>
<p>"The Casino will occasionally offer Promotional Coupons as Free Chips. The maximum withdrawal amount for any free chip given is $100. For example if you are given a $ 100 free chip and request a withdrawal amount of $500, you will only be approved for $100.</p>
<p>Free Chips cannot be used in succession by the Player. If a player redeems a free chip, regardless if the offer was sent to the Player via the Casino or they redeemed it via Customer Support, they cannot redeem a second Free Chip and be eligible for a withdrawal on that Free Chip’s winnings. It is the sole responsibility of the Player to ensure they are following the Free Chip rules. Withdrawals will be denied at the approval stage with the Payments team if this rule is broken.</p>
<p>In case a Player uses a coupon or a promotional offer that they aren’t eligible for use, all and any winnings created from that promotion are forfeited.</p>
<p>The Player may not redeem multiple no-deposit bonuses. Free processor offers are meant merely for our regular faithful customers and you should have an active depositing account unless otherwise stated in order to cash-out on a free chip offer. Should a Player redeem one no -deposit bonus and then be subsequently offered another one, the Player must make a real money deposit for the Player into their account in the interim in order to be eligible to redeem the second no-deposit bonus.</p>
<p>In case a Player redeems a no-deposit promotional offer that he or she is not entitled to, any winnings generated from that promotion will be voided.</p>
<p>The Player has the right to just one free chip between deposits; any winnings caused by multiple free chips will be null. For instance, should two free processors be redeemed by a Player in a row, they are not going to have the capacity to get any winnings by playing on said processor created. They are free to enjoy the games on the site however.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, the max cash-out for all no-deposit bonuses can’t surpass 1 times the sum value of the bonus redeemed. All free chips valued at or below $100 will have a cash-out limitation of no longer than, nor less than, $100.</p>
<p>Welcome courtesy bonuses have a maximum withdrawal amount of $100.00 for all NEW players.</p>
<p>Should funds that are won by a Player be higher compared to max cash-out sum, these surplus funds will be removed upon withdrawal. No additional sum will be paid.</p>
<p>All No Deposit Bonuses are subject to the Wager Conditions and Maximum Withdrawal Limits recorded above.</p>
<p>If you use any bonus to collect a characteristic guarantee(s), or additional bonus rounds, and use a following deposit and or bonus to redeem built up attribute bonus rounds, the winnings coming from said bonus round(s) shall invalidate all or any winnings. No deposits will be refunded."</p>
