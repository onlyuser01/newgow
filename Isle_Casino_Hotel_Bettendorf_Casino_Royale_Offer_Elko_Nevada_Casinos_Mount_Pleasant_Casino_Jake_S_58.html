<p>Online sports betting and gaming group bet365 announced it has been named the Official Betting Partner of the upcoming boxing match between Chris Eubank Jr and Liam Smith.</p>
<p>‘Huge Night of British Boxing’</p>
<p>Anticipating a landmark year for British boxing, bet365, through its partnership with the event and promotional company BOXXER, has moved to boost its brand awareness among fans of boxing by becoming the official betting partner of the match on January 21, 2023.</p>
<p>“Live on Sky Sports and brought to you by our partners at BOXXER, we’re thrilled to be part of this huge night of British boxing,” a spokesperson for bet365 commented on the announcement, drawing attention to the upcoming “explosive night” of boxing.</p>
<p>Prior to the match at the Manchester Arena, the two middleweight British boxers separated by only one year in age boast 32 wins each but Eubank Jr has tasted defeat only on two occasions as compared to Smith’s three losses and many predict a close fight with the odds slightly titled in Eubank Jr’s favor.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be an explosive night on January 21st, and bet365 has you covered with a huge selection of pre-fight markets, the bet365 spokesperson continued, propping the operator’s “industry-leading In-Play product” to “take center stage once the bell rings, offering live odds and bet boosts throughout” the match.</p>
<p>Eubank Jr has been involved in fewer demanding fights than his opponent and many believe his speed and power will be too much for Smith to overcome, who, on his turn has still to prove that he is capable of winning a so-called ‘marquee’ fight, giving him an extra source of motivation.</p>
<p>In-Arena Branding</p>
<p>The partnership will allow bet365 branding to appear prominently across all pre-promotional activities such as press conferences, open workouts and weigh-ins, as well as at the arena during the fight night, featuring 360-degree branding across the ring corners, ropes and toblerones, and on the venue’s screens, banners and boards. bet365’s logo will also feature on the ring canvas and arena barriers.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, bet365 will continue to be the official odds partner of BOXXER for the event and will also feature via integration with BOXXER’s social and digital channels, while bet365 odds will be displayed at the platform in the build-up to the match and the platform will be exclusive for in-play optimizations.</p>
<p>Fans of boxing at bet365 in select international markets already enjoy live streams of BOXXER’s shows as the partnership between the promotional platform and the Stoke-on-Trent-based brand aims to enhance customer experience globally.</p>
