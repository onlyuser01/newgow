<p>SBC Summit Barcelona 2022 was truly something to remember with the conference drawing around 6,000 delegates, one of the biggest attendances on record, and in fact the largest crowd that the event has been able to pull in. With its careful planning from September 20 through September 22, and thousands of distinguished guests, attendees, and speakers, the SBC Summit Barcelona proved to be one of the focal points of the gambling industry in Europe.</p>
<p>Casino Guru News was present at the event and across its panels. The team managed to provide potential partners with details on what the company does and why, collected interesting interviews, and ran extensive coverage of the many important panels. Casino Guru even had Šimon Vincze, Casino Guru's Sustainable &amp; Safer Gambling Lead, among the speakers at the "Affordability in a new era" panel.</p>
<p>SBC reported excellent satisfaction rates as well, with the hosts confirming that 92.6% of attendees were very likely to repeat the event and come back. The floor featured 200 booths exhibiting their products with close to 400 speakers attending. SBC CEO &amp; Founder Rasmus Sojmark was thrilled with the latest edition and what it meant for the industry.</p>
<p>"I keep receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback and could not be happier with our performance. I would like to thank all our exhibitors, sponsors, speakers, and attendees for their support, and I’m thrilled to hear that everyone got what they came for," Sojmark said cited by SBC News.</p>
<p>SBC also carried out a detailed survey to petition attendees about their likes and dislikes about the event with the overwhelming majority praising SBC Summit Barcelona, the organization, conferences, exhibition floor, and even the networking parties that brought people together. People agreed that a lot of hard work must have gone behind the event, and it showed. The iGaming &amp; Casino zone was among the most attended with 34.6% of all attendees, followed by 27.6% for the Sports Betting Zone.</p>
<p>The newly introduced Emerging tech, Blockchain, and Metaverse zone also stoked interest among attendees who were excited. All in all, SBC Summit Barcelona 2022 was a blast as Casino Guru News can confirm. The speakers featured the legendary Molly Bloom who proved a little too camera shy, DAZN Group CEO Shay Segev, Sportradar CEO and Founder Carsten Koerl, and many other notable guests and industry specialists.</p>
<p>Next on the list, SBC is organizing the Latinoamerica event which will take place on November 1-3.</p>
