<p>Football Fuels Mississippi Sports Betting As Casinos Handle $37.9M in September</p>

<p>Mississippi’s state-licensed sportsbooks handled nearly $37.9 million in bets in September, nearly double the amount it had for the previous month. That’s according to information released by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, football accounted for the increased action. With a full month of regular season NFL and college gridiron games available, bettors gambled nearly $25.7 million. That represents 67.8 percent of all dollars wagered.</p>
<p>Parlay cards, which are considered separate even though many are strictly tied to football games, accounted for almost $6.5 million in handle.</p>
<p>The state’s casino sportsbooks generated revenues of $5.6 million. With a 12 percent tax rate, the state collected $675,790. The state kept more than $450,000 of that amount, with the remainder divided among the municipalities hosting the state’s casinos.</p>
<p>The September handle was the third-best for Mississippi, trailing only last November ($44.5 million) and December ($41.8 million). It also marks the first time the handle has jumped over the $30 million mark since March, and that $32.4 million total was primarily due to the NCAA college basketball tournament.</p>
<p>Mississippi vs. Iowa</p>
<p>As one of the first states that launched sports betting after the Supreme Court’s repeal of PASPA, Mississippi has now been taking bets for more than a year.</p>
<p>The $37.9 million bet in Mississippi is slightly less than the $38.5 million Iowa’s sportsbooks handled last month. However, while both states are similar in population (Iowa is home to 3.2 million people compared to Mississippi, with 3 million), Iowa’s total includes mobile sports betting. More than 56 percent of the money wagered in Iowa was through a mobile device.</p>
<p>Mississippi currently does not allow bets to be placed off of casino grounds. It currently has 26 casinos with sports betting licenses across the state.</p>
<p>Handle Up From Last Year</p>
<p>The September handle marked the second consecutive month the sportsbooks’ handle increased month-to-month in the state. In August, Mississippi’s books took nearly $19.9 million.</p>
<p>October’s handle may very well increase from last month, but not necessarily because of football. Earlier this month, Houston businessman Jim McIngvale placed a $3.5 million bet on the Houston Astros to win the World Series at the DraftKings Sportsbook at the Scarlet Pearl Casino in Biloxi.</p>
<p>Compared to a year ago, the September 2019 handle represents a 19.2 percent increase from the same month. However, the taxable revenue increased by less than $130,000. That’s due mainly to the 17.3 win percentage the sportsbooks had in September 2018, versus the 14.9 percent rate they had last month.</p>
<p>Most of Mississippi’s action took place at its coastal casinos. The region, home to a dozen casinos, generated $25.4 million in bets last month, including $16.9 million in football alone.</p>
<p>The state’s seven northern casinos, all located near Memphis, Tenn., accounted for $7.4 million in wagers, with $5.1 million of that going toward football.</p>
<p>Mississippi’s seven central casinos generated $5.1 million in sports wagers, with $3.6 million bet on football.</p>
