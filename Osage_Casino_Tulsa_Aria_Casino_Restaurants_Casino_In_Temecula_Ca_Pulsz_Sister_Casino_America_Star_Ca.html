    <h1>Osage Casino Tulsa Aria Casino Restaurants Casino In Temecula Ca Pulsz Sister Casino America Star Ca</h1>

<p>I have cleared the wagering requirements for the No Deposit Bonus.</p>
<p>The support told me what I needed to withdraw. Some initial deposit and betting, and KYC. I made my first deposit and made a bet.</p>
<p>Then I sent a driver's license and a resident card for KYC. (Sorry, but those are Japanese.)</p>
<p>Then they sent back a boilerplate.</p>
<p>I thought the Japanese material was not good. However, I don't have an ID card that can be used in English.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don't have a passport. However, in order to do what I could, I sent a bank balance certificate (in English) instead of a resident card.</p>
<p>Then they sent me boilerplate.</p>
<p>When asked what the problem is, they reply with a boilerplate.</p>
<p>The photos I send are in 4k resolution.</p>
<p>The photo can be read as long as it is not in very small letters.</p>
<p>I don't understand what the problem is because they only reply to boilerplate sentences.</p>
<p>Therefore, I do not know how to correct the material.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
