    <h1>Pittsburgh Rivers Casino Hotels Near Cherokee Casino Nc Harrahs Casino Laughlin Hard Rock Casino Las</h1>

<p>Hello. First of all, duelbits is where my friend told me to play, then I realised my sibling is also playing online casinos. We decided to open up accounts, he used my code on his account and I used his on mine. So we could share refferals. There was nothing about it in ToS of duelbits. Firstly we used to chat on this website, I got permanently mute, but did not care. After 2/3 years I've got permanently banned with about 750$ in refferals. When I asked support why is it about, they said it's multi-account, so they decided to ban me. Tried contacting them, but they said there is no way of my account getting unblocked ever again, even if I tried to provide all information needed about me and my sibling. The ToS got changed about 1 month ago, then right after my account got banned. The ToS now says "Multiple accounts per household IP/Subnet. If multiple natural persons from the same household wish to access duelbits.com please inform our Support first and complete the verification for each of them. Our Support will gladly assist you in the verification and explain to You everything, that is needed from You." But I did not even get a chance to read it, support did not message me about anything, and when I try to contact them via e-mail, they just say "Account won't be reopened." But the ToS got changed literally month ago, and right after that my account got banned. I can provide all informations needed, that I am a brother of another user on duelbits. Thank you.</p>
