<p>Greentube, a Novomatic division, has added its iGaming content portfolio to Spanish operator CasinoBarcelona.es. The deal between the content supplier and the Iberian operator marks another step within the regulated European market. The release specifies that the integration is carried through the Tecnalis platform, launching a number of esteemed titles, including Book of Ra, Sizzling Hot, Lord of the Ocean, and Diamond Link.</p>
<p>Greentube Carries on With Expansion Efforts</p>
<p>The expansion of Greentube has been quite consistent recently with lots of new deals in Europe and North America. In August, the content supplier made its debut in the newly open and regulated Ukrainian market through an agreement with FirstCasino.</p>
<p>In May, the interactive division of Novomatic entered British Columbia via the British Columbia Lottery Corporation. Two months later, they continued their expansion in a second Canadian province, Quebec, after a deal with Loto-Quebec. In September, a third North American deal was struck for Greentube – this time with GNOG, seeing its casino games introduced on the New Jersey regulated market.</p>
<p>How Is Greentube and CasinoBarcelona’s Alliance Looking?</p>
<p>Greentube is an established name in the gaming industry with a history spanning more than two decades. The company made its first steps via the 3D sports game Ski Challenge in 1998, but back then, the company was operating under a different name, Dürrschmid &amp; Reisinger OEG.</p>
<p>The content supplier has proven itself a pioneer in repeatedly introducing high-quality entertainment. In 2000 the company was renamed Greentube Internet Entertainment Solutions AG, and in 2010 it became a property of Novomatic.</p>
<p>CasinoBarcelona.es operates in Spain and is part of Peralada Group, which has built a solid reputation for itself in the past 40 years. Xavier Ballester, CEO at CasinoBarcelona.es, also commented on the deal in the light of their long-term cooperation with Novomatic:</p>
<p>“We are very happy to further extend this partnership and, in this way, provide our players with excellent content from Greentube.” Xavier Ballester, CEO at CasinoBarcelona.es</p>
<p>The key account manager for Spain and Italy at Greentube, Graziano Pozzi, expressed his delight about the company’s prospects in Spain:</p>
<p>“Novomatic’s land-based titles are well-established performers for CasinoBarcelona.es, and we strongly believe that by building on this rich heritage, we can create a partnership that takes both parties to the next level.”This was the second deal in the country in less than two months. In September, Greentube signed an agreement with another leading operator, Casino Gran Madrid Online.</p>
