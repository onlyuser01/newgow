    <h1>Alliante Casino Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort D Iberville Ms Casino Rea</h1>

<p>Hello, good day dear team and everyone involved,</p>
<p>I signed up at Drip Casino, verified my account and made a first deposit for my first welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Maxbet rule: No bets exceeding €5 were adhered to, and forbidden games were not played. I check this in the Bonustherms/Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>After a successful first deposit, I checked the maximum betting rules and which games were allowed and prohibited, so I played bonus games that are deposited in the casino and are only allowed and available for bonuses, RM (real money games) cannot be played with the bonus, so I played a bonus game that was available and also allowed, I won around €4700 and when I left the game I bet my credit with another game that is also allowed and can be played with bonus money, which is also a bonus game because of that Winnings are part of my bonus money and are not real money. That was clear to me! When I did this I bet and wagered the required turnover, when I wagered part of the balance during the night, I wagered the remaining part the next day</p>
<p>to meet the required wagering requirement.</p>
<p>After successfully converting the credit, I brought a sum of €6155 to the cash register and made a request for around €800!</p>
<p>This was rejected when I saw it 2 days later, I made a new request in the same amount, this was immediately canceled again after a few minutes!</p>
<p>I went to the operator/agent and asked what the problem was:</p>
<p>He accused me of a DELAY IN THE RUNE and that I had made MISSIONS and they were NOT COMPLETED.</p>
<p>He recommends that I log out, clear cookies and cache, then re-enter the casino and enter the game I was using (name XY) and end the missing money or the round there.!</p>
<p>I followed the instructions and did exactly that, when I went into the game no bet was made on my part, credit was not refunded by the game and the round was already over, or the slot/game didn't move!</p>
<p>Live chat agent/operator reported it to technical support! I have to wait for an answer now! Screenshots are present of verification (KYC) approved, deposit history and recent play history. Withdrawals were repeatedly canceled.</p>
<p>When I opened Casinoguru and checked for ongoing complaints regarding this casino, I discovered that I am not the only one and that 2 other people have the exact same problem, we are specifically accused of delaying rounds and or placing bets and not to have this completed.</p>
<p>It is the first payout request in this (Casino-Drip), at the sister casinos of this company the payout requests always worked without any problems because I am familiar with the rules and know the bonus system is the same and works 1 to 1 in the same way as at the sister casinos !!</p>
<p>I ask for help and a solution to the problem</p>
<p>Send me an email so I can send the documents to you. I would like to thank you for your willingness to help and wish everyone involved a good day.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Thomas</p>
