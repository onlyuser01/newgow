<p>The leading online betting platform and gaming operator, Sun International, announced a new appointment. On Friday, the company revealed it hired the services of Michael Owen, the former star from Manchester United and Liverpool, to the role of brand ambassador.

Moreover, Owen will bring score predictions and signed memorabilia, among other engaging activities. Outside of the soccer vertical, the legendary player is also a racehorse trainer and owner and has been engaged in horse racing for years.

<p>It was back in 1997 when Owen started his soccer career with Liverpool when he was at the age of 17. This made him Liverpool's youngest goal scorer, as well as a player. Throughout Owen's career, he was part of Newcastle United as well as Manchester United, among other globally-recognized teams. Overall, he has appeared more than 500 times and has more than 220 goals on a club level.</p>

<p>He pointed out that he is looking forward to sharing his extensive knowledge with SunBet's passionate fan base. Finally, Owen pointed out: "I am thrilled to be joining one of South Africaâ€™s leading brands and one which shares my passion and enthusiasm for football, horse racing and other pursuits."</p>
<p>Simon Gregory, SunBet's CEO, was similarly delighted to see Owen become a brand ambassador for the company. "We are absolutely delighted to have Michael on board as a brand ambassador to provide and share his deep insights of the game of football with SunBet customers," he said. Gregory predicted that soccer fans and fans of the English Premier League, will find Owen's advice invaluable and enjoy his predictions, analysis, insights and commentary.</p>
<p>"As a former player at the highest level, he knows exactly what goes through the minds of players and managers at key points in a match and during the course of an arduous season and brings this to bear in his commentary and analysis," explained SunBet's CEO in conclusion.</p>
