<p>The 2023 Formula One is coming to Vegas! The first F1 race to take place in Sin City since 1982 is scheduled for Sunday, November 19 â€“ the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p>
<p>The penultimate race of the 2023 Formula 1 season is just around the corner. Max Verstappen has already secured the championship, but the destiny of many other drivers could be decided after the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Sergio Perez is hoping to secure the No. 2 spot, but Lewis Hamilton is determined to ruin his plans. Then there are Fernando Alonso, Lando Norris, and Carlos Sainz, each with a chance to break into the top 3 in the 2023 F1 Driversâ€™ Championship standings with a win at the 2023 Las Vegas GP.</p>

<p>Reasons Why Verstappen is the Top 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix</p>
<p>The Red Bull Racing superstar won 17 of the 20 Formula 1 races run in 2023. This fact makes it counterintuitive to think of any other driver as a serious contender in the Las Vegas GP.</p>
<p>Verstappen has simply been driving on a much higher level than anyone else in the competition. He also has the best card in Formula 1, as well as the best team.</p>
<p>His Red Bull Racing teammates have helped him many times this season to break all sorts of records â€“ including the one for most race wins in a single campaign â€“ so maybe now is the time for him to take one for the team?</p>
<p>What weâ€™re talking about is a scenario in which Verstappenâ€™s role in the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix is to help his colleague Sergio Perez win the race. The reason? A win on November 19 would mean securing the No. 2 spot in the World Driversâ€™ Championship standings.</p>
<p>Sergio Perez In Need of a Win in Sin City</p>
<p>Sergio Perez is sitting in the No. 2 place in the F1 standings. The Mexican currently has 258 points, which is 22 more than third-placed Lewis Hamilton. Knowing that the race winner gets 25 points, Perez could collect enough points to make sure that the Englishman wouldnâ€™t be able to leapfrog him.</p>

<p>Alonso moves up to fourth, Norris to fifth ðŸ‘€#F1 #BrazilGP pic.twitter.com/iZPfPjQMgc â€” Formula 1 (@F1) November 5, 2023</p>
<p>Even if Hamilton won 18 points on Sunday by finishing second, Perez would still secure his spot in the overall rankings with a triumph in Vegas. If Perez won the 2023 Las Vegas GP and Hamilton came second, the point gap between the two would be 29 points.</p>
<p>Obviously, Perez has the motivation to win the Sin City race and so does his team. Verstappen might try to help his teammate on Sunday, but this doesnâ€™t mean others will raise a white flag. On the contrary, there are a few more drivers determined to give their utmost in Nevada.</p>
<p>Battle for 3rd (and 4th) Spot in the F1 Driversâ€™ Standings</p>
<p>Fernando Alonso (198 points), Lando Norris (195), and Carlos Sainz (192) are the three drivers who stand a chance to take the No. 3 spot from Lewis Hamilton. The chance of that happening isnâ€™t too high considering that the 7-time champ is bound to take the remaining two races super seriously.</p>
<p>However, this doesnâ€™t mean those three guys have nothing to fight for. Considering that only a couple of points separate them, theyâ€™ll be battling for the fourth spot, which is currently in Alonsoâ€™s possession.</p>
<p>2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix Prediction</p>
<p>Sergio Perez is our Las Vegas GP pick. Heâ€™s a fantastic driver whoâ€™s a part of the best team in Formula 1. Further, this guy has already proved that he knows how to win races â€“ he won two of the three races his teammate Verstappen failed to win in 2023.</p>
<p>Pick: Sergio Perez to win</p>
