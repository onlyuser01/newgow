<p>AC Milan Dreaming of Their First Champions League Title in 16 Years</p>
<p>I Rossoneri are the second-most successful club in the history of the Champions League/European Cup with seven titles in their collection. The last time they won it, however, was a relatively long time ago. It happened in 2007.</p>
<p>Since then, they haven’t done much in this competition. The furthest they went in the UCL was the quarterfinal stage. The good news for them is that they got a good chance to get to the semifinal this season. For that to happen, they need to knock Napoli out of the competition.</p>
<p>What’s giving them confidence that they can do it is that they destroyed the Sky Blues 4-0 in their first game of April. The most impressive fact about that win is that it happened on Napoli’s turf.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the heaviest loss Napoli suffered at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona since losing to Bologna 5-1 in September 2000. Back then, the name of the stadium was Stadio San Paolo.</p>
<p>Napoli Players are 100% Focused on the Champions League</p>
<p>Napoli is the new champion of Italy. Even though there are nearly two more months left before the end of the 2022-23 Serie A season, it’s almost certain that Napoli will win the trophy. This is going to be their first Serie A title since 1990 when legendary Maradona was their captain.</p>
<p>During the Diego era, the Sky Blues from Naples also won the UEFA Cup (now known as the Europa League). What’s interesting is that this team has never won the Champions League (or its predecessor, the European Cup).</p>
<p>In fact, reaching the quarterfinal in the 2022-23 UCL season is their best achievement in this competition. Can they take a step further?</p>
<p>AC Milan vs. Napoli Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a very interesting UCL quarterfinal, with both teams going far and beyond to win. We think AC Milan is going to win the first leg, but we’re not sure whether that’s going to be enough to take them to the semis. It’s because we think they’re going to win by only one goal, something Spalletti’s boys can annul in Naples a week later.</p>
<p>Pick: AC Milan to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
