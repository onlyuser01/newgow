    <h1>Mega Ball Casino Fire Kirin Casino Topaz Lodge Casino Toronto Casino Flandreau Casino BetMGM to Now</h1>

<p>Pariplay, a subsidiary of NeoGames SA has announced that its aggregation solution has now facilitated a new launch for Ignite partner Skillzzgaming</p>
<p>As a result, Skillzzgaming titles will be debuted on the US iGaming market through the Fusion platform, which aggregates and distributes games with top-tier operators. Skillzzgaming’s products are now available with BetMGM, one of the leading iGaming and betting brands in the market.</p>
<p>Pariplay Brings Skillzzgaming to the US with BetMGM</p>
<p>The launch is hailed by both Skillzzgaming and Pariplay. The supplier has demonstrated its ability to help third-party partners launch in coveted markets and guide promising studios into some of the most promising iGaming jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Pariplay and BetMGM presently have a health collaboration that covers all markets in which Pariplay holds a license to operate in. As a result, BetMGM players will have access to a number of top-performing titles by Skillzzgaming, including Fruit Blast, along with other top choices.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Pariplay commercial director Shivan Patel said that the launch constituted a proud moment to have facilitated the launch of Skillzzgaming content with BetMGM. Patel added:</p>
<p>As an Ignite partner, it is especially satisfying that we have been able to make Skillzzgaming our first third-party launch through Fusion in this market. It is a key achievement and the start of what we see as an epic growth journey. Pariplay commercial director Shivan Patel</p>
<p>Skillzzgaming CEO Eran Sharar was equally pleased with the opportunity to launch in the US market and through none other than Pariplay and BetMGM. The operator commands a considerable player base in the US market, making it a perfect choice for Sharar as well.</p>
<p>BetMGM Makes for a Strong Local Partner for Skillzzgaming</p>
<p>Sharar said that the Ignite program has provided his studio with the opportunity to further boost its reach and enter a highly lucrative market and opportunity such as the United States. The fact that Skillzzgaming’s titles are appearing with BetMGM, though, is also proof that Skillzzgaming is on the correct path.</p>
<p>Pariplay has cultivated a very strong local footprint in the United States. The company has boosted its presence in the US market through a partnership with Resorts Digital in New Jersey. Another successful attempt to strengthen the company’s presence in the market was made earlier in January through a partnership with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino.</p>
