<p>The judge’s decision, issued on November 9, not only voids the existing lease but also mandates that Nassau County planning officials restart the entire process, including new hearings with the county legislature. The ruling is seen as a significant victory for Hofstra University, whose campus is adjacent to the proposed casino site, and has been a vocal opponent of the development.</p>

Poser highlighted the importance of public participation in decision-making and conveyed eagerness to contribute to the planning process while ensuring the community is protected from potential environmental risks.</p>

In a statement, the company conveyed its dedication to the Nassau Hub project, asserting that Las Vegas Sands is moving forward with their proposal for an integrated resort and entertainment center at the Nassau Hub with pride and enthusiasm.</p>
