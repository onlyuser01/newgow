<p>New Mexico Racetrack Licensee Hopeful Promises ‘Moving Grandstand’ for Onlookers</p>

<p>One man hoping to land a New Mexico racetrack license is following the advice of the iconic stripper Gypsy Rose Lee: ya gotta have a gimmick.</p>

<p>Daniel Lee, CEO of Full House Resorts, wants to build the La Posada Del Llano resort casino in Clovis, New Mexico featuring a horsetrack with a “moving grandstand.” The bleachers would hold hundreds of people and move along the track in unison with the horses, allowing spectators to “race side-by-side with the horses for every dramatic second of the race,” according to a company-issued press release.</p>
<p>While betting on horses is the quintessential American gambling experience, it’s often viewed from a stand where viewers only really see horses and their jockeys as they fly by. While fans can be heard screaming for stallions to “get there,” they often miss the very moment that they do — unless it’s seen on a large-screen TV.</p>
<p>You Are There</p>
<p>In an era of hi-definition television and all-inclusive stadium experiences, sitting down to watch horses run around a track might seem closer to watching paint dry than an action-packed day of sports entertainment.</p>
<p>In a typical race, spectators in the grandstand only see two brief moments of a race: its start and the closing seconds at the finish line,” Lee said. “By reinventing the viewing experience, we intend to open horse racing to a new generation of fans.</p>
<p>“We believe that eastern New Mexico [where we intend to build] has tremendous potential to attract visitors from throughout the area, including from nearby Amarillo, Lubbock, and other parts of western Texas,” Lee said.</p>
<p>Earlier in August, Full House reported second quarter revenue totals increased by 2.8 percent over the previous year. The La Posada del Llano proposal comes as Full House is “on the verge of another moment in our company’s growth,” Lee said when speaking of the company’s second quarter results.</p>
<p>Sixth License Up for Grabs</p>
<p>The New Mexico Racing Commission began taking applications for the state’s sixth racing license in May of next year, and officially announced the applicants at its Thursday, August 23 commission meeting, although the names had previously been released.</p>
<p>Along with the racetrack, the proposal includes an 18-hole golf course and is aimed at recognizing the region’s Hispanic heritage. Lee is on board with that vision.</p>
<p>“We wanted to design a facility that the City of Clovis — and really, the entire State of New Mexico — can be proud of,” Lee said. First, he will have to beat out four competitors, which include Clovis Racetrack and Casino, L&amp;M Entertainment, Coronado Partners, and Hidalgo Downs.</p>
