    <h1>Sunland Park Racetrack Casino Sunland Park Nm Buffalo Creek Casino Penn Casino Si Casino Casinos Nor</h1>

<p>I have made two payouts. One for 2000$ and another for 600$.</p>
<p>It has been over 48 hours and I have not received any money. Playfina has not responded to any of my emails. The chat people are like robots; they keep telling me that my money is being processed and that they sent it to my bank and that they sent me an SMS code and an email with a password to access my funds. First of all, they don't send money direct to banks - they go through Gigabyte, hence the password. I told them that I receive all the other promo emails they send me but that I did not receive their email with password and it is not in my sms messages either. They asked if I checked my junk folder...the level of incompetence is mind boggling. They have not tried to rectify my problem. They tell me to contact my bank, and say what??? My money is still sitting in the casino account. I am able to cancel the 2000$ payout and use that money if I wanted to play -- if my money was processed, that 2000$ would not be available for me to play. They pretend to escalate my issue to the finance department and then the technical department - no one has gotten in touch with me to fix this issue and they have my 2600$ and I believe they are trying to steal my money. This is by far the worst casino experience of my life and not one person working there has the ability or desire to solve problems. I want my money back and then my account to be closed with these people as they are truly causing me a stress I don't need. I have proof that my money is still sitting on their site. I have not had anyone contact me trying to solve my issue from their company. This is horrible and I will not stop until I get my money back. I have proof that the 2000$ is still there as "cancellable" cash, they are blatantly dishonest.</p>
