    <h1>Tachi Palace Casino Resort Barona Resort And Casino Tachi Palace Hotel Casino California Bayou Casin</h1>

<p>Roxane Lukas, a specialist in HR, organization, and coaching will become the new chief people capability officer (CPCO) at casino game developer Light &amp; Wonder. She will be responsible for boosting performance, engagement, and inclusion.</p>
<p>This Is Her First Position in the Gambling World</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder is Lukas’s first foray into the gambling industry. She graduated from New York University with a Master’s degree in Executive development, continuing her education at the University of Santa Monica, where she obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Spiritual Psychology. Lukas later rounded out her education with certifications in Soul-Centered Facilitation and Consciousness, Health, and Healing from the University of Santa Monica. She also completed IMPAQ’s B State’s Breakthrough Leadership Team System course to receive credentials as a licensed facilitator.</p>
<p>Lukas spent the first few years of her career with assessment and coaching company BeamPines and clothing giant Levi Strauss &amp; Co, where she honed her leadership and executive development skills.</p>
<p>The Bulk of Her Career Was in the Video Game Industry</p>
<p>Her big breakthrough came in 2004 when she started work for video game developer Electronic Arts (EA). Over the course of nearly eight years, she grew from HR manager at the studio’s Redwood Shores office to VP, leading the company’s global HR team. Lukas helped the game developer’s growth from 300 to 2500 employees and 25 new countries and assisted with the smooth integration of over 15 acquisitions.</p>
<p>After her work with EA, Lukas became senior VP at fashion brand operations and services provider TechStyle, where she managed the company’s talent during its critical maturation stages. After that, she returned to the video game industry, becoming chief people officer at mobile game developer Scopely. Once again, her work focused primarily on scaling the company’s leadership practices and leading its global people team amidst rapid international expansion.</p>
<p>Amidst her work with high-profile companies, Lukas founded two coaching and consulting projects but has currently decided to put this work on hold.</p>
<p>Lukas Joins L&amp;W amidst Plans for Future Growth</p>
<p>As Light &amp; Wonder CPCO, Lukas will leverage her significant experience to oversee the company’s people functions and will help the company’s 5,000 employees across six continents excel in an engaging, inclusive, and high-performance environment.</p>
<p>The incredible teams, culture, and opportunity to have impact have inspired me to join this amazing company. Roxane Lukas, CPCO, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder CEO Barry Cottle expressed his excitement to have Lukas join the management team. He noted that the company prioritized attracting the top talent in the industry, and this recent hire was no exception.</p>
<p>The significant expertise, leadership, and experience that Roxane possesses will only strengthen our abilities to further cultivate our high-performance culture and expand our team of Creators worldwide. Barry Cottle, CEO of Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>The L&amp;W CEO stated that the company aimed to become the leading cross-platform global game provider. The highlights of Lucas’ career have often put her in a position to manage rapid international growth. If Light &amp; Wonder’s ambitions come true, she will have another prime opportunity to put these skills to good use.</p>
