    <h1>Seven Mile Casino Vegas Casino Online Real Money 4 Queens Casino Hotels Near Firekeepers Casino Batt</h1>

<p>B2B provider of online casino gaming technology, content and services EveryMatrix released today its fourth quarter and full-year 2021 financial report, posting strong financial performance.</p>
<p>Profit and EBITDA Growth</p>
<p>The leading supplier to the online gaming industry posted a gross profit of €13.9 million ($15.8 million) for the fourth quarter and €51.5 million ($58.5 million) for the full year to mark an increase of 26% on the Q4 2020 result and 32% on full-year 2020 profit.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to report excellent results for the fourth quarter and 2021 as a whole in terms of strong gross profit and EBIDTA growth, onboarding of new clients, and deals signed.” Ebbe Groes, Group CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>The company registered growth in EBITDA which amounted to €4.4 million ($5 million) in Q4 2021 and €19.7 million ($22.4 million) for the full year 2021 to register a growth of 23% and 65% on Q4 2020 and full year 2020, respectively.</p>
<p>The strong financial performance EveryMatrix registered in 2021 was attributed to growth in past product investment, successful launches with new client brands that expanded the group’s footprint with tier 1 operators and progress across markets in the US.</p>
<p>But there were also significant regulatory headwinds in Europe that significantly impacted the company’s performance in the online casino vertical, EveryMatrix CEO Groes outlined.</p>
<p>“We delivered this result despite the regulatory changes in Germany which have impacted the Casino segment significantly. This achievement proves the positive effect of the bold leap EveryMatrix took when investing heavily in product and technology. It has given us a strong, diverse and competitive product offering and the ability to attract new clients.” Ebbe Groes, Group CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Key Milestones</p>
<p>In January, EveryMatrix reported the OddsMatrix sports betting solution had achieved a record turnover in the fourth quarter of 2021 and reached a significant milestone of over €100 million ($133 million) per month of total bets.</p>
<p>The group signed with four new tier-1 operators in the fourth quarter, all four operating on markets outside of Europe, to increase its 2021 tally to eight.</p>
<p>In addition, EveryMatrix launched eight new client brands turnkey projects in Q4, to contribute to a total of 19 turnkey launches in the year and affirm EveryMatrix’s presence across regulated gaming jurisdictions such as Denmark, Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Romania, and Mexico.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix RGS, EveryMatrix’s gaming content aggregation platform, was live with nine partners by the end of the fourth quarter, available across 15 regulated markets, offering 18 game titles, among which three from Spearhead Studios.</p>
<p>Among other key milestones reported by the company are the integrations with CasinoEngine of game content from ten-game vendors, as well as 13 payment integrations to bring the total to 80+.</p>
<p>Groes concluded by expressing his confidence about the group’s prospects, based on the number of active leads, client and new product launches that further demonstrate the momentum with the company’s “innovative product offering and highly scalable and modular software platform.”</p>
