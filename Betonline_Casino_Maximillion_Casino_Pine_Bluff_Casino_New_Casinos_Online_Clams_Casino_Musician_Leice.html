<p>The leading online casino and sports betting brand, managed by BVGroup, the Gibraltar-based online gambling operator, Parimatch, announced a new partnership with the professional soccer club based in Leicester, England, Leicester City Football Club. Details regarding the new collaboration emerged in a statement released on Monday, August 21, 2023.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new partnership, Parimatch was designated as the team's Official Betting Partner. The latest deal represented a partnership renewal, as Leicester City FC and Parimatch have collaborated before. Now, the new deal will be in effect for the 2023/24 season, the leading online casino and sports betting brand confirmed.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Parimatch will benefit from increased exposure via the team's pitch-side LED advertising boards. The leading betting and gaming brand will engage in different activations such as interviews at the King Power Stadium. Moreover, Parimatch will benefit from offline advertising and website banner rights, allowing it to reach new soccer and sports fans as well as bettors.</p>
<p>Harj Hir, Leicester City's Head of Partnerships, shared his excitement about the latest announcement saying: "We’ve enjoyed a successful relationship with Parimatch since they first joined the Club at the start of the 2020/21 season, and we’re delighted to extend our partnership with them." Finally, Hir pointed out: "We’ve helped to grow each other’s international profile over the past few years, and we now look forward to building on that success."</p>
<p>Filip Pirozenok, the Head of Parimatch UK, added: "We are delighted to continue working with Leicester City Football Club and to be their Official Betting Partner for another season." In conclusion, he explained: "Partnering with Leicester City ensures that Parimatch can tap into Championship advertising, while allowing us to offer exclusive promotions, competitions, and giveaways to our customers."</p>
<p>Leicester City FC is a soccer club with a rich history. It was founded way back in 1884 and was previously known as Leicester Fosse FC. While the team plays its home games at King Power Stadium, they also compete in the EFL Championship. As noted, Leicester City previously collaborated with Parimatch a few years ago and the new deal builds upon that success.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Parimatch is a brand with solid experience in the betting and gaming vertical. It currently has a strong presence in European markets such as the UK and Ukraine and offers a variety of online gambling options, including sports wagering.</p>
