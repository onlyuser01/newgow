<p>Queen’s Day Tilt review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The high middle ages were a time of chivalry when the values of honour, chaste love, and protection of the weak were as popular in the literature of the time as they were ignored in the grubby reality people lived in. It was around this time that tales of King Arthur became popular on the European continent along with the joust.</p>
<p>Queen’s Day Tilt takes you back in time to a joust of the period. The background is an almost fairytale castle and the foreground a sports ground in which knights could knock seven bells out of each other.</p>
<p>Whoever gets more winning combinations is the winner of this bonus game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are lovely, with heraldic symbols pinned to sandstone blocks making up the majority of the reels. The win animations and sound effects have a nice heft to them and make watching the symbols break immensely satisfying.</p>
<p>The music is a bit repetitive and has that faux-medieval piping sound which can become very grating very fast. Overall though a triumph of design.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Queen’s Day Tilt has an almost unique gameplay style among slot machines; rather than having win lines, wins are awarded for rows of symbols vertically or horizontally, starting anywhere i.e. any two or three symbols in a group will pay out (excluding diagonals).</p>
<p>This makes for a fast-paced game with a win that develops through a few stages, ramping up the tension and keeping the player engaged.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols, and appears at random on non-winning spins.</p>
<p>Wild symbol appears randomly in the base game</p>
<p>Symbols are removed when they are part of a win. If you clear the entire grid of symbols, you trigger the Queen’s Day Bonus. If you have one symbol left, the Tilt feature can activate, removing that last symbol and triggering the Queen’s Day Bonus anyway.</p>
<p>Last symbol on the grid might start the free spins bonus</p>
<p>The Queen’s Day Bonus gives you five Free Spins. During the Free Spin rounds a multiplier of two is applied to all wins, this multiplier increases by one every time you win with both knight symbols on a spin.</p>
<p>You can retrigger the Queen’s Day Bonus.</p>
<p>If you win with both the knight symbols in one spin in the base game, then you trigger the Game of Accession. In this game only the two knight symbols are put on the reels and one free spin awarded. Before the spin you pick one of the knights to win. If your chosen knight ends up with the most winning combos on the spin, then you double your winnings from the triggering spin. A draw triggers a new respin and a loss means you are paid out your winnings from the triggering spin with no multiplier.</p>
<p>Pick your knight for a bonus round - Game of Accession</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Queen’s Day Tilt is 96.36%, a respectable amount which is a little higher than the roughly 96% we use for average around here.</p>
<p>The bet sizes on the site we tested started out at $/£/€0.10 and ran up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin. Most people’s bet size preferences will fall somewhere in that range.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is very high, making this a fantastic game to use with our preferred slot strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The real winner of the Queen’s Day Tilt is Queen’s Day Tilt. The blend of interesting gameplay, fast-paced action, charming visuals and high RTP and volatility all add up to a strong recommendation from us for this slot from Play'n GO.</p>
