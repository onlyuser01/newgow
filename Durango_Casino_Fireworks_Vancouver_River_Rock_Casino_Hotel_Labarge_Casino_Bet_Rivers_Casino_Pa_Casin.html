<p>Elevating guest experience across Great Canadian venues will be much easier with Live Nation Canada on their side</p>
<p>Gaming and hospitality operator Great Canadian Entertainment announced today it has agreed upon an exclusive partnership with Live Nation Canada that will bring some of the biggest names in music and comedy to its venues in Canada.</p>
<p>Live Music and Comedy Shows</p>
<p>The agreement reached between Great Canadian Entertainment and Live Nation Canada will see the live entertainment company serve as the exclusive booking agent for the events while both partners will promote the programming jointly.</p>
<p>Gavin Whiteley, chief marketing officer of Great Canadian Entertainment, commented on the development, thrilled that Great Canadian partnered with “the premier live entertainment promoter in the world,” Live Nation Canada.</p>
<p>“This partnership will bring some of the biggest and most exciting artists to our exceptional venues, providing guests with unforgettable experiences they will cherish for years to come,” Whiteley said.</p>
<p>Great Canadian Entertainment currently operates 25 gaming, entertainment and hospitality facilities in Ontario, British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, and is planning on opening the country’s largest casino resort, Great Canadian Casino Resort Toronto, later this year.</p>
<p>The brand-new CA$1 billion ($749 million) casino resort with a 400-room hotel, expanded covered parking, and multiple on-site dining options, will also feature a 5,000-person entertainment venue, The Theatre, where famous musicians and comedians will also perform once the resort opens to the public.</p>
<p>Other venues that will feature through the strategic alliance with Live Nation Canada will be the brand-new The Arena at Pickering Casino Resort, River Rock Casino Resort, Hard Rock Casino Vancouver, Molson Canadian Centre at Casino New Brunswick, and The Schooner Showroom at Casino Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Committed to Elevating Guest Experience</p>
<p>Seeking to elevate the experience at Great Canadian Entertainment’s live venues from coast to coast, the partnership is the latest display of the company’s commitment to delivering world-class entertainment and experiences to its guests across all its casino and hospitality venues.</p>
<p>Leveraging Live Nation Canada’s global presence, vast industry network and relationships with artists and musicians, Great Canadian Entertainment is expecting to raise the bar by offering a wide range of events and the best live experiences nationwide.</p>
<p>One of Great Canadian’s 12 Ontario venues, Casino Woodbine, hit the newswires in April after awarding a massive CA$3.2 million ($2.4 million) progressive jackpot to a Toronto-based solutions contractor and Great Canadian Rewards member, Marcelo Loyola.</p>
