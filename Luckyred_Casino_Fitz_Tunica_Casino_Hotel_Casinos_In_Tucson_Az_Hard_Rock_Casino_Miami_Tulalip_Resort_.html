<p>Six of the most esteemed gambling operators in the United States have joined forces to fight against gambling harm. The companies have pledged to be more responsible and protect their customers.</p>
<p>Operators Will Work for a Safer Gambling Market</p>
<p>The six operators in question are BetMGM, DraftKings, Bally’s Corporation, MGM Resorts, Entain and FanDuel. All of them promised to adhere to twelve fundamental principles of safer gambling. The initiative comes just in time for Responsible Gaming Education Month.</p>
<p>The principles are based on four fundamental pillars, which include operating in regulated jurisdictions only, conducting responsible business practices, making sure that online gambling is fun and providing tools to support players who might need them. This includes self-exclusion, loss limits and other responsible gambling solutions.</p>
<p>In addition, operators promised to protect vulnerable people from harm and to prevent underage gambling at all costs. The six companies have also vowed to support the establishment of a national hotline for those who have been harmed by gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Operators will furthermore update their responsible gambling initiatives and donate money to organizations that research problem gambling.</p>
<p>The Companies Are Fully Committed to Being More Responsible</p>
<p>BetMGM’s chief legal officer, Joshua Jessen noted that his company has always strived to be socially responsible and caring for its players. He asserted that the whole BetMGM team is committed to the 12-point pledge and promised that the operator would do everything to stop problem and underage gambling.</p>
<p>Chrissy Thurmond, senior director of responsible gaming at DraftKings, said that DraftKings is delighted to join this “landmark effort.” She said that DraftKings is happy to adopt the 12 principles, which she believes will benefit consumers all over the United States.</p>
<p>Martin Lycka, senior VP for regulatory affairs at Entain, called the 12 principles “an important milestone” for the industry and said that he is thrilled to see so many major companies commit to a safer US gambling market.</p>
<p>Lastly, Adam Warrington, VP of responsible gaming at FanDuel, said that his company is looking forward to working with the rest of the brands. He said that the operator is excited to collaborate with the remaining companies to protect the entire industry.</p>
<p>This news comes just a few days after FanDuel announced it would double down on its responsible gambling efforts. The company recently renewed its agreement with the seven-division boxing champion Amanda Serrano. Serrano was chosen as one of FanDuel’s brand ambassadors and will help the company promote healthier gambling.</p>
