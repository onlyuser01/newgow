<p>EveryMatrix, the leading business-to-business technology and content provider, announced it has been awarded a new public tender by Veikkaus, the Finish state-owned gaming and lottery monopoly.</p>
<p>Veikkaus Selects EveryMatrix for Gaming Tender</p>
<p>The terms of the new collaboration will see Veikkaus leverage EveryMatrix’s leading casino content including its iGaming Integration Platform and CasinoEngine solution. Additionally, the operator will benefit from gaining access to a growing catalog of the supplier’s 65 gaming providers which will continue to expand even further. The Finish state-owned gaming and lottery monopoly also gains access to content from Armadillo Studios and Spearhead Studios, as well as a growing list of providers that are a part of EveryMatrix’s SlotMatrix. The selection of EveryMatrix as the partner of Veikkaus comes after a competitive tender process. With that in mind, the terms of the new agreement cover six years.</p>
<p>“We are very happy and look forward to starting cooperation with EveryMatrix.“ Jan Hagelberg, chief product officer at Veikkaus</p>
<p>Jan Hagelberg, Veikkaus’ chief product officer, outlined that the monopoly is happy about the new partnership with EveryMatrix. He explained while offering the best content is a key priority for Veikkaus, it also focuses on offering safe online casino entertainment for its customers. Last but not least, Hagelberg pointed out that EveryMatrix has a wide range of gaming portfolio offering some of the best games in the industry.</p>
<p>Currently, the Finnish monopoly Veikkaus has more than 2 million customers. The operator is a member of the World Lottery Association (WLA) and part of its revenues are redirected toward different Finnish programs and campaigns including youth work, health campaigns, as well as culture and science initiatives, among other programs.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Has Similar Partnerships in Place</p>
<p>Stian Hornsletten, EveryMatrix’s chief commercial officer, deemed the recently awarded tender a major milestone for the company. He revealed that the company already has established partnerships with other state-owned monopolies and currently has all the needed experience to offer the best services for Veikkaus. Last but not least, Hornsletten said: “Our team looks forward to supporting Veikkaus in their journey, and we are keen to get started as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Winning Veikkaus as a client marks another major milestone for EveryMatrix.“ Stian Hornsletten, chief commercial officer at EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Only recently, EveryMatrix announced a new deal with Supremeland Gaming. The collaboration was revealed last week and saw Supremeland become an exclusive partner for EveryMatrix’s SlotMatrix. Now, thanks to the recent tender awarded by Veikkaus, EveryMatrix continues to expand its global footprint.</p>
