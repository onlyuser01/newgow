    <h1>Wingate By Wyndham Lake Charles Casino Area Ameristar Casino St Charles Mo Los Angeles Commerce Casi</h1>

<p>Well, Metaspins ran a story-telling promotion where they had you complete the ending for a story they had started.</p>
<p>I participated, which involves you going to a Google form with a limited amount of characters allowed to write the ending of this story.</p>
<p>So after Halloween was over, you got to vote from 1-10 a few handpicked stories that the staff at Metaspins deemed worthy as finalists.</p>
<p>So I go to vote, and right away I noticed that some of the finalist stories were way over the character limit. I brought this to the attention of the staff and they acknowledged it.</p>
<p>Anyways, the terms stated winners will be picked (5 winners) and credited 3 days after Oct 31</p>
<p>4 days in and the voting is still happening</p>
<p>Then the winners are posted…. Only the top 3 winners are posted. What about the 4 &amp; 5 positions winners ?</p>
<p>So of the top 3 winners, one of the stories was 3 times as long as the other two and way over the character limit.</p>
<p>I inquired about this, and the other two missing winners</p>
<p>I was told that the staff decided to allow the big story through because it was very good and that the other two winners have been credited but not posted.</p>
<p>So I asked, and was told they have made an exception to the terms and conditions. Violating their own terms and conditions???? U kidding me?</p>
<p>Now what’s rather interesting is that when you write your ending for this story. You are forced to use google forms which has a preset character limit.</p>
<p>You actually cannot submit anything over that limit, it won’t let you.</p>
<p>Soooooooo how in the heck did that super long story hey through ?</p>
<p>What bugs me here is that, the terms and conditions got this promotion were violated.</p>
<p>A person gets to cash out $300 USDT because someone on the inside decided they would break their own laws so to speak?</p>
<p>wheres the transparency with the last two winners. Or is this whole promo a total sham ???</p>
