<p>A Las Vegas casino will continue to hold its place in the world of NASCAR, as the South Point Hotel and Casino has extended its sponsorship deal with Richard Childress Racing (RCR) through the 2018 season. This will mark the seventh year in a row in which South Point and RCR have partnered on at least one car.</p>

<p>“The South Point Hotel &amp; Casino is excited to be continuing our partnership with Richard Childress Racing in the 2018 season,” said South Point owner Michael Gaughan.</p>
<p>The sponsorship will see the casino as the primary sponsor of the #21 Chevrolet Camaro driven by Daniel Hemric. The car will primarily be seen on the NASCAR Xfinity Series, the secondary level of racing that acts as a minor league competition below the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.</p>
<p>New Driver in 2018</p>
<p>Having Hemric driving the South Point car will be a new look for the partnership. Since 2012, the South Point/RCR relationship was linked to Brendan Gaughan, who is the son of Michael. Last year, Gaughan finished in the top 10 of the driver championship point standings, making the 2017 Xfinity Series Playoffs.</p>
<p>“Watching Brendan carry our colors these past couple of years on the track and into Victory Lane has been a lot of fun,” Michael Gaughan said. “We’re looking forward to continuing the accomplishments during this coming season with Daniel Hemric. Daniel is a great driver and we know he will represent the South Point well both on and off the track.”</p>
<p>Hemric, 26, saw his first sustained success in NASCAR in 2015 when he competed full time on the Camping World Truck Series. In 2017, he joined Richard Childress Racing, where he compiled seven top-five finishes in his first season on the Xfinity Series.</p>
<p>“Daniel made it to the XFINITY Series Championship 4 this past season and we look forward to another season of watching him compete for the championship,” RCR Chairman and CEO Richard Childress said.</p>
<p>South Point Loves NASCAR</p>
<p>There has been a longstanding relationship between South Point and NASCAR, one that has resulted in many partnerships between the two entities.</p>
<p>Last month, it was announced that a second Cup Series race at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway (LVMS) would be known as the South Point 400 as part of a multiyear agreement between the track, resort, and NASCAR. The race will take place on Sept. 16 next year.</p>
<p>“Racing has been one of my life’s greatest passions, and it’s a dream to be deeply involved with a sport I love,” the senior Gaughan said in a press release announcing the race sponsorship.</p>
<p>“The South Point and LVMS have had a long and strong partnership,” he said, “and we can’t wait to be part of the track’s second tripleheader weekend next year.”</p>
