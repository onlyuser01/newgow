<p>Online gambling and sports betting will be arriving in Saskatchewan, Canada, early next month, a new report reveals.</p>
<p>SIGA Reveals PlayNow Is Expected to Launch on November 3</p>
<p>Last week, the Saskatchewan Indian Gaming Authority (SIGA), revealed that the launch of the first and only online gambling and single-event sports betting website called PlayNow.com is expected on November 3, 2022. Under an operating agreement with SaskGaming, SIGA will be the official operator of PlayNow in the province. This will effectively deliver regulated and legal sports betting and online gambling activities for residents of one of the two landlocked provinces in Canada.</p>
<p>“Saskatchewan’s first and only legal online gaming and sports betting site, PlayNow.com, will be available to Saskatchewan residents beginning Thursday, November 3, 2022,“ reads a statement released by the Saskatchewan Indian Gaming Authority</p>
<p>Besides the upcoming launch of the PlayNow platform, SIGA unveiled a sponsorship agreement with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, the professional Canadian football team based in Regina, Saskatchewan. As a result of the collaboration, PlayNow’s logo was embroidered on the team’s jerseys. According to SIGA, additional promotions and activations for sports fans will be introduced via the PlayNow platform soon.</p>
<p>The upcoming launch is the result of efforts dating back to last year. In September 2021, the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) inked an innovative first-of-its-kind deal with the Saskatchewan province, enabling SIGA to launch PlayNow. Bobby Cameron, FSIN’s Chief, shared his excitement by saying that the agreement will bring economic benefits to First Nation communities and residents of the province. SIGA revealed that Saskatchewan residents that are age 19 or older can already start pre-registering for the PlayNow platform.</p>
<p>PlayNow Expected Offer Safe and Secure Entertainment</p>
<p>Zane Hansen, SIGA’s CEO and president, revealed that being the exclusive provider of sports betting and online gambling in Saskatchewan brings excitement. He acknowledged that the Authority will offer secure and safe entertainment for sports fans and gamblers. Hansen explained that at the same time, SIGA will reinvest proceeds into Saskatchewan province.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be the exclusive provider of Saskatchewan’s first and only legal online gaming site, which will provide a safe and secure option for residents to play their favorite casino games and bet on their favorite sports teams online.“ Zane Hansen, president and CEO at SIGA</p>
<p>SaskGaming’s president and CEO, Susan Flett, added that the upcoming launch of single-event sports betting and online gambling will expand the entertainment options for Saskatchewan’s residents. Last but not least, Flett deemed the timing of the launch perfect, considering the province will be hosting the 109th Grey Cup in November.</p>
