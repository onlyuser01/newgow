<p>Nuvei continues to pivot towards the North American market with the company now teaming up with GAN in what is an alliance forged to help expand the company’s footprint in the region. The two companies have worked together for a while, first coming together to spearhead a launch in Ontario last April.</p>
<p>Nuvei and GAN Seek to Grow North American Presence</p>
<p>Now, though, the pair wants to see their efforts spread to the rest of Canada and the United States, with North America remaining a priority. Nuvei, which delivers on advanced payment systems, will be able to reach more customers through GAN’s proprietary technology. Commenting on this opportunity, Nuvei chairman and CEO Philip Fayer said:</p>
<p>“Offering gaming operators a fully customizable payments platform, including local acquiring solutions and a full suite of payment methods through a single integration, is at the heart of our vision for the future of payments in both gaming and broader verticals.” Nuvei chairman and CEO Philip Fayer</p>
<p>He welcomed the opportunity to be entering the Norm American market in collaboration with GAN, which is a great step forward for the company. Fayer was confident that the North American iGaming and interactive wagering industry will continue to develop as Nuvei meets consumers’ needs and provides a seamless payment solution.</p>
<p>Nuvei is a purveyor of advanced payment options that make it simpler and easier for sports fans and casino players to onboard themselves with their favorite digital brand. The company has already signed a number of high-profile partnerships in North America, first with Hard Rock Digital, and now with GAN among others.</p>
<p>Preferred Payment Partner Globally</p>
<p>GAN president of enterprise solutions Don Ryan was equally happy with the development and said that the company was pleased to be adding Nuvei as its trusted partner in the North American market. He argued that together, GAN and Nuvei will be able to create best-in-class solutions that will enjoy rapid adoption by operators in the region.</p>
<p>In March, Scout Gaming picked Nuvei as its payment partner for the United States. The company also struck other important partnerships, signing up with Real Luck Group in Q4, 2021.</p>
