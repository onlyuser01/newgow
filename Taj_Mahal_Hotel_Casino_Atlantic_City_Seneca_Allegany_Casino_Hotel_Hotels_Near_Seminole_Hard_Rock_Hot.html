    <h1>Taj Mahal Hotel Casino Atlantic City Seneca Allegany Casino Hotel Hotels Near Seminole Hard Rock Hot</h1>

<p>After it started accepting license applications in May, the Michigan Gaming Control Board announced that it approved 15 provisional licenses for online and sports betting. The leading industry operators FanDuel, William Hill, DraftKings, and PointsBet have secured a provisional license in Michigan.</p>
<p>15 Provisional Licenses Approved by Michigan Regulator</p>
<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) announced yesterday that it approved 15 provisional licenses for platform providers in the state. Those providers will be supporting both commercial and tribal casinos’ online gaming and sports betting offering in Michigan.</p>
<p>In a statement, MGCB’s executive director, Richard S. Kalm, revealed that the regulator was able to approve provisional licenses “following the filing of the administrative rules for online gaming and sports betting Dec. 2 with the Office of the Great Seal”.</p>
<p>“The platform providers’ ability to meet the requirements of the laws and rules will determine which entities can be licensed for launch first.“ Richard S. Kalm, MGCB executive director</p>
<p>Kalm acknowledged that further regulatory requirements are pending and must be met before the launch of online sports betting in Michigan. He added that the launch date depends on how quickly the operators can meet those requirements.</p>
<p>Leading Industry Operators Secure Provisional Licenses in Michigan</p>
<p>According to the MGCB, provisional licenses were issued to GAN, William Hill, FanDuel, Golden Nugget, and PointsBet. Furthermore, Rush Street Interactive, Kambi, Fox Bet, Wynn Sports as well as Parx Interactive, and Penn Sports Interactive have also secured a provisional license. DraftKings, TwinSpires, Roar Digital as well as NYX Digital Gaming were also among the operators who have secured a provisional license in Michigan.</p>
<p>The Michigan regulator also noted that besides the pending regulatory requirements, each operator will need to undergo independent testing of platforms and games. Consequently, the regulator needs to approve the operators’ internal controls which ensure gaming integrity. Furthermore, MGCB revealed that operators will need to secure occupational licenses for some employees.</p>
<p>With that in mind, back in May, the MGCB started accepting license applications. The regulator has allowed operators and platform providers to introduce their applications prior to the launch. Although residents can download the applications and create accounts, wagers cannot be placed before the launch of sports betting in Michigan.</p>
