<p>Dear ymymym,</p>
<p>The fact you self-excluded yourself in a Dama n.v. casino doesn't mean that all your accounts in other casinos of the same owner will be blocked or self-excluded automatically. Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>I am afraid that if you do not have a self-exclusion request and your account has been closed, there is not much more we could do in this case and we cannot ask the casino to refund your deposits. I understand your frustration, but this evidence is necessary for us to proceed with a case like this.</p>
<p>My recommendation going forward is to ask for self-exclusion in casinos where your account is not self-excluded yet. The email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible. I would also strongly recommend that you always save your self-exclusion request so that you have a valid proof of such action.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings xxx xxx,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx (gambling problem)</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please, let me know if there is anything else I could help you with, otherwise, I will be forced to close this complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
