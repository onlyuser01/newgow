<p>Dear Customer,</p>
<p>Please be informed that your account has been closed in our casino due to registered collusion which is a clear breach of our Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Please be informed that all your activity has been thoroughly investigated and the decision has been made based on evidence we received from this investigation.</p>
<p>As it is stated in our Terms and Conditions (Fraudulent Activity, article 131) , Casino Sieger has a zero tolerance policy towards inappropriate play, bonus abuse, player’s collusion and fraudulent activity. If, in Our sole determination, the Player is found to have cheated or attempted to defraud Us or any other User of any of the Games in any way including, but not limited to, game manipulation or payment fraud, or if We suspect the Player of fraudulent payment, including use of stolen credit cards, or any other fraudulent activity (including any chargeback or other reversal of a payment) or prohibited transaction (including money laundering), We reserve the right to suspend and/or close the User Account and to share this information (together with the Player’s identity) to other online gaming websites, banks, credit card companies, and appropriate agencies.</p>
<p>Also allow me to inform you that with closing your account all your winnings will be waived and any withdrawal request will be rejected, which is also clearly stated in our Terms and Conditions (Closing account, article 63).</p>
<p>The decision that has been made is final and non negotiable, and without possibility of reopening of your account or any type of refund.</p>
