    <h1>Mr Lucky Casino Movies In Red Rock Casino Casino Offers Bodines Casino Hollywood Casino Charles Town</h1>

<p>Silverback Gaming, a proprietary studio of the tech provider GAN, has released Golden Calaveras, a new game that celebrates Mexico’s Day of the Dead. This is notably the first game the studio has released since its acquisition by the tech giant and will be released as a part of Relax Gaming’s Silver Bullet program.</p>
<p>Players Can Multiply Their Bet by 50,000x</p>
<p>Golden Calaveras is an exciting 3×5 slot that provides many opportunities. The game has 10 paylines that count in both directions. The high-volatility title allows players to multiply their bet by as much as 50,000x.</p>
<p>During a Golden Calaveras game, players will collect various symbols, including Mexican-styled letters, sombreros, banjos, candles and skulls. When spinning the reels, players may also earn special Golden Calaveras symbols. After each spin, the skull coins will flip, revealing various bonuses. Lucky players may also get an oversized Mega Skull symbol that yields a total of nine Golden Calaveras, bringing players guaranteed wins.</p>
<p>There is a multiplier track under the reels that players should keep in mind. Consecutive combinations will boost the multiplier, helping gamblers earn more from their bets.</p>
<p>A Free Spins Game Will Keep Players at the Edge of Their Seats</p>
<p>There is another type of symbol that players can earn when spinning the reels – Freespin gravestones. When the reels land on three such symbols, players will get an instant 20x win and trigger the bonus game that takes them to a nighttime version of the Mexican town.</p>
<p>Once the bonus game is triggered, players will get either 10, 20, 50 or 100 free spins. During the bonus game, the multiplier will increase with each spin, allowing players to cash in on some huge rewards. In addition, gravestones will now award gamblers with 2 additional spins.</p>
<p>Players can also buy free spins and enter the bonus game instantly in markets that permit such features.</p>
<p>Silverback Worked Hard to Deliver an Authentic Experience</p>
<p>Raphael Di Guisto, founder of Silverback Gaming, spoke about the new title. He said that the company truly wanted to release something that is both fresh and engaging.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to produce a game that feels authentic, from its design and graphics to the gameplay and sounds. We have also included features that are available to offer to the various jurisdictions the game is available in, including a Bonus Buy for those that allow it. Raphael Di Guisto, founder, Silverback Gaming</p>
<p>Di Guisto said that the game will be available in operators’ lobbies starting September 27.</p>
<p>Simon Hammon, chief executive of Relax Gaming, lauded Silver Bullet for making such a great title and said that he can’t wait to launch the game on Relax’s Silver Bullet platform.</p>
