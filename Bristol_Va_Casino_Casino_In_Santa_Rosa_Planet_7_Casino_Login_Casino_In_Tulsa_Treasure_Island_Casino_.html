<p>888 and Nuvei already boast existing agreements in Europe and Ontario</p>
<p>Canadian financial technology specialist Nuvei unveiled a new partnership agreement with 888, a global gambling juggernaut. As per the deal, the former company will enhance the operator’s payment capabilities, helping it expand its presence in the United States.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, 888 will leverage Nuvei’s superior tech platform, acquiring reach, instant bank-to-bank payments and profound knowledge of iGaming to bolster its business while preventing risk.</p>
<p>Nuvei’s Instant Bank Transfer is the first payment method for instant account-to-account deposits and payouts in the US. This means that 888’s American customers will now be able to directly move funds between their 888 account and their bank card.</p>
<p>This is not the first time 888 and Nuvei have worked together. The fintech specialist has been powering 888’s European business with solutions ever since 2017. In addition, the tech company helped 888 make a foray into the Canadian province of Ontario, which legalized iGaming last year.</p>
<p>The new agreement with 888 cements Nuvei as a leading fintech provider to the iGaming industry. The company is well-known for its solutions that help operators maximize revenues while providing players with intuitive payment options.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the provider also penned a partnership arrangement with Resorts Digital Gaming.</p>

<p>Representatives of the two companies shared their thoughts on the agreement. Nuvei’s chairman and chief executive officer, Philip Fayer, said that his team is excited to grow its relationship with 888. Fayer noted that the fintech provider is excited to help the operator expand by powering its US business with many key solutions.</p>
<p>Optimizing card payment acceptance is a key component of the cashier experience, and Nuvei has decades of experience supporting operators maximize their revenue growth. Philip Fayer, chair &amp; CEO, Nuvei</p>
<p>Noam Klivitzky, 888’s vice president of US marketing, recognized the importance of such solutions. He said that seamless deposits and withdrawals are “critical to the overall platform experience” and something that players appreciate a lot.</p>
<p>At 888 we’re committed to offering the most comprehensive iGaming experience in the market, so we’re excited to add Nuvei’s card acquiring capabilities alongside its Instant Bank Transfer solution. Noam Klivitzky, VP of US marketing, 888</p>
<p>Klivitzky praised Nuvei’s history of helping iGaming operators optimize their performance through fintech solutions.</p>
<p>Speaking of 888, the company recently welcomed Per Widerström as its new chief executive officer. The appointment came shortly after the departure of 888’s director of business development, Yariv Lavi.</p>
