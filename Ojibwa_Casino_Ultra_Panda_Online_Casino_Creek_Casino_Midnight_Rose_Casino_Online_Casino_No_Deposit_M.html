<p>Money Train 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed on the Wild West, but with a steampunk twist.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves in a desolate scene with the ruins of a town crumbling in the desert. It’s immediately clear this game will have a darker mood.</p>
<p>Framing the reels is a souped up monster train, adorned with metal spikes. Players will enjoy the impressive detail of the machinery.</p>
<p>The symbols are colourful, but rendered in less high definition that lovers of the original Money Train might hope. The mad scientist character is especially mesmeric with his malevolent grin.</p>
<p>Overall, this game effortlessly blends a steampunk aesthetic with Wild West energy for a winning cocktail.</p>
<p>Big win in the Money Train 2 slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The mournful music twangs like it would in a Western film when the hero has fallen on hard times. This makes it loud and clear that this is no cheery cowboy world.</p>
<p>The animation of the sunset illuminating the dusty air is undeniably beautiful despite the sinister vibe. Further enhancing the apocalyptic feel is an abandoned windmill eerily spinning in the wind.</p>
<p>The characters hit a fun balance between cowboy and steampunk, making for an ultra cool look. The quality of the character animation feels lower than the game's predecessor, but nonetheless they set the right mood.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Money Train 2 is a five reel, four row slot, with forty win lines. Each of the individual symbols spins independently.</p>
<p>A respin feature is triggered whenever two Scatter symbols land. Each Scatter is assigned a randomised value and the respins begin. The respins continue until a winning combination lands. The player receives +1 to their multiplier for each respin that occurs.</p>
<p>When a win lands, the multiplier is applied to the Scatter’s randomised values as well as to the winning combination.</p>
<p>The rugged pacing of this game feels just the right to keep tensions high.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all other symbols to complete pay lines.</p>
<p>Things get interesting with the Money Cart bonus round. This is triggered when players land three or more Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels.</p>
<p>Some of the special symbols that appear in the Money Cart bonus round</p>
<p>The Persistent (gold) symbol is allowed to sub in for the Bonus symbol when players are triggering the Money Cart bonus round.</p>
<p>When the bonus round begins, symbols that trigger the feature unveil a number which is displayed as a multiplication of the bet, then three spins are awarded.</p>
<p>Persistent Collector symbol collects all multipliers for all following respins</p>
<p>When players fill a reel with symbols, they will unlock an additional reel. Players can do this up to twice in a single bonus round.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
