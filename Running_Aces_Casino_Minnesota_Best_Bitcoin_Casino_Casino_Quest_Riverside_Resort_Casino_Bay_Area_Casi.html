    <h1>Running Aces Casino Minnesota Best Bitcoin Casino Casino Quest Riverside Resort Casino Bay Area Casi</h1>

<p>Casino Guru, the self-proclaimed ultimate guide to the casino world, has reported that it has helped hundreds of players get refunds in May. Thanks to the company’s Complaints Resolution Center, unfairly treated bettors have received a total of $915,000 back.</p>
<p>Casino Guru Helps those in Need</p>
<p>The aforementioned number sets a new record for the company, whose workers spent 1,114 hours on the cases to make sure the players got their money back. In total, the team received 822 complaints and successfully resolved 265 of them.</p>
<p>Casino Guru’s Complaints Resolution Center is quickly growing as the go-to place for those who have been mistreated by operators. As more people grow aware of the company’s services, the influx of complaints ramps up. For reference, in May 2021, there were only 452 complaints. A year later, this number is almost twice as high.</p>
<p>2022 has been an eventful year for the company. Since its beginning, Casino Guru has successfully helped 1,113 players and has had almost $3 million returned to them. Casino Guru remains committed to promoting safer gambling and helping those who have gotten in trouble with operators.</p>
<p>As an example of what problems the Complaints Resolution Center deals with, its biggest resolved complaint this year was helping a player get his $181,000 in winnings back. The player had requested a loss limit which, in turn, had restricted his account and had made him unable to withdraw his prize.</p>
<p>The Team Is Proud of Its Work</p>
<p>The lead of Casino Guru’s complaints team, Petronela Kontos, praised her team’s achievements. She noted that helping so many players and earning their trust feels incredible. Kontos believes that the Complaints Resolution Center has come really far since its launch three years ago. According to the lead, she can now proudly say that Casino Guru’s complaints team has become the leader in the segment. Kontos also teased that Casino Guru will continue working on new improvements to ensure a frictionless experience.</p>
<p>Kontos thanked Casino Guru for investing in the team. She noted that the complaints resolution center is always working free of charge, which means that it constantly needs support. Lastly, Kontos said that she is happy that Casino Guru allows the team to help people and concluded that her team members are proud of the impact they are leaving behind.</p>
<p>Casino Guru has a very important role in the contemporary gambling ecosystem. Not only does the platform help with the resolution of problems, but it also helps to prevent them. Players will likely avoid operators with a lot of complaints. Therefore, companies now have all the reasons to be fair and just to their customers.</p>
