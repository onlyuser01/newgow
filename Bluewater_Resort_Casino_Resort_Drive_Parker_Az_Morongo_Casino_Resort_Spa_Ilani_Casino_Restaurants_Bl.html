<p>We’re three rounds into the 2022-23 Premier League and Liverpool have only two points. Nevertheless, the Reds are still second in the list of EPL title favorites, priced at +600. What this means is that bookmakers still have faith in Jurgen Klopp’s boys. They expect them to start playing better ASAP, with a win over Bournemouth on Saturday, August 27, looking like a certainty.</p>
<p>Knowing that Bournemouth have won only one Premier League game against Liverpool in history, it’s no surprise the Reds are seen as huge favorites this coming weekend. In fact, it seems that the real question in this match isn’t whether Liverpool are going to win, but with what difference?</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Bournemouth Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline</p>
<p>Liverpool -1250 Draw +1000 Bournemouth +2200</p>
<p>Goals Over/Under</p>
<p>Over 2.5 -278 Under 2.5 +220</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Date : Saturday, August 27</p>
<p>: Saturday, August 27 Time: 10:00 AM ET</p>
<p>10:00 AM ET Place: Anfield in Liverpool</p>
<p>A Must-Win Game for Liverpool</p>
<p>There are several reasons why anything but a win over Bournemouth would be seen as huge upset for Liverpool. First of all, the Reds are desperate for points as they got only two after three Premier League rounds.</p>
<p>They played 2-2 with Fulham on the road, after which they drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace at home. Finally, on Monday, they lost to Manchester United 2-1. As a result, they’re now seven points behind table leaders Arsenal, and five points behind the #1 EPL title favorites, Manchester City.</p>
<p>That said, failure is not an option for them if they want to challenge for the trophy this season. Another reason why they’re expected to win is that they usually do great on their turf. At Anfield, Liverpool are unbeaten in the Premier League for more than a year.</p>
<p>They also have a fantastic home record against Bournemouth, with four wins in the five EPL games they two have played so far. An interesting fact is that in three of those, we saw three goals scored. We think something similar might happen on Saturday as well.</p>
<p>Bournemouth Praying for a Dignified Defeat</p>
<p>It’s very likely that everything in Bournemouth knows that their team is not going to do great on Saturday. The Cherries have won against Liverpool only once in the history of the club and we probably aren’t going to see them get their second victory anytime soon.</p>
<p>The thing is that they’re not a very good team. They played in the Championship last season and are among the top relegation candidates right now. Actually, the odds that they will get back to the Championship are just -250.</p>
<p>They did start the season in top gear, beating Aston Villa in the first round. However, in the following two games, they lost – Manchester City beat them 4-0, Arsenal won 3-0.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Bournemouth Prediction</p>
<p>Anything but a dominating win for the Reds would be a huge upset. Everyone seems to know this, including the bookies who are giving super-short odds on Liverpool.</p>
<p>This is why bettors might want to consider putting their money on other markets, like handicap a.k.a. spread, for example. Liverpool (-2.5) looks like a good bet with the odds of -110. We also expect to see Liverpool’s best player Mohamed Salah put away a goal or two. The odds on Salah to score anytime are currently -152.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool (-2.5); over 2.5 goals; Mohamed Salah – anytime goalscorer</p>
