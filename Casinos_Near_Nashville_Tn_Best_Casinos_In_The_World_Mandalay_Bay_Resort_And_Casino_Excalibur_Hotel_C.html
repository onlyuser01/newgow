    <h1>Casinos Near Nashville Tn Best Casinos In The World Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino Excalibur Hotel C</h1>

<p>Dear team,</p>
<p>I am playing BlackJack at Speedybet since April 2020. I am a big gambler. My deposits so far are about € 600.000. My withdrawals are about € 530.000.</p>
<p>In June 2020, there was a verification process. I had to submit my bank statements and all other belongings (source of income). While this process was happening, Speedybet blocked my account and withheld all pending transaction, which is fine and understandable.</p>
<p>I provided all required documents and my accounts was unblocked and my withdrawals were processed. My winnings vary from € 2.000 to € 11.500 (highest). These are processed very quickly (same day) normally.</p>
<p>In October 2020, I got the message that Speedybet has to do a verification again. This time they called it a Souce of Wealth verification, which is fine again, since I know there are certain regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>I provided all the required documents, but this time there responding time was much slower. I received updates in a week, asking for more and more documents. I provided and then a week later they requested more (clarification). This happened a few times.</p>
<p>Finally they asked for some final documents to clarify some transactions in my account. These were regarding loans I provide to some friends. I am a professional gambler. I make big money, I spend big money and so now and then I help some friends out with giving them some loans.</p>
<p>Speedybet wanted clarification regarding these loans. I told them I am the provider. I am not borrowing money as you can see in my bank statements. This was not sufficient, they wanted to see signed loan agreements, which did not exist. These loans were on a verbal basis. I trust these people because they are my friends. Also repayments were visible in my bank statements.</p>
<p>Speedybet told me that they will not process my case if I do not submit signed loan agreements and they asked me to create them now with the parties.</p>
<p>Fine once again, I contacted my friends, explained the situation and asked them to sign the loan agreements with full repayment schedules and sent them to Speedybet.</p>
<p>Speedybet asked for more information regarding the parties who send the documents, copy of their ID's or Passports, which I also provided (not sure if they can do this regarding Privacy, but in the sake of completeness I submitted).</p>
<p>Now this last step happend 10 days ago, 24th November. Normally they give me an update every 5 days or maximum 7 days, but now I am not hearing anything. It is the final step and they just had to check 2 simple loan agreements.</p>
<p>I keep contacting them by chat or e-mail, but they keep telling me that they cannot give me an update and that the case is still with the relevant department. I am not getting more information than this.</p>
<p>I have 2 withdrawals pending, one of € 3.500 and one of € 10.125.</p>
<p>I am not sure if they are doing this because of the amount. I have had bigger withdrawals than this in the past (€ 10.000+). And it is not like that I am winning more than I am spending. I can understand that they want to check the source of my wealth. But I have provided everything and they still keep stalling and delaying.</p>
<p>It not acceptable that this process should take over a month. And that they are taking 10 days to give any substantive answer.</p>
<p>I am really getting frustrated, because they keep delaying and delaying and not giving me any answer. The only thing they keep saying is "be patient, you will get an update soon, you will be contacted by mail, sorry we cannot speed this up".</p>
<p>I hope you can do something about this, because this is taking way too long.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Dan</p>
