<p>No. 2 Georgia on Upset Alert Visiting No. 13 LSU in Baton Rouge</p>

<p>The No. 2 Georgia Bulldogs (6-0) travel to Baton Rouge to take on the No. 13 LSU Tigers (5-1) in an SEC match up that highlights week seven of the college football season. If oddsmakers have it right, the game in Death Valley will be a hotly contested affair.</p>

<p>Las Vegas sportsbooks have the visitors spotting LSU eight points, and the over/under at 50.5 points. The Tigers are seeking revenge for a bad loss a week ago when they traveled to Florida and fell to the Gators 27-19.</p>
<p>LSU already has two victories this year over Top 10 teams (No. 8 Miami, No. 7 Auburn), and look to make it three on Saturday when the game kicks off at 3:30 pm ET.</p>
<p>Georgia faces their first real test in LSU. The Bulldogs have just one win over a ranked opponent (No. 24 South Carolina), but Saturday begins three consecutive games versus Top 25 programs.</p>
<p>We’ve got some tough games,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. “I think that our tests are upcoming. I think we play some good football teams starting this week with what’s an extremely physical, well-coached football team, in a tough place to play.”</p>
<p>Despite being ranked the number two team in the nation, Georgia is at 6/1 to win the College Football Playoff National Championship. That line is longer than No. 3 Ohio State and No. 4 Clemson (9/2).</p>
<p>Marquee Games</p>
<p>There are two other games featuring Top 25 programs squaring off against one another.</p>
<p>No. 7 Washington (5-1) travels to No. 17 Oregon (4-1) for a Pac-12 showdown that, at least on paper, should be a close one. Las Vegas books have the visiting Huskies spotting the Ducks just a field goal.</p>
<p>The nationally televised primetime ABC game of the week pits Big Ten powerhouses No. 15 Wisconsin (4-1) against No. 12 Michigan (5-1) in the Big House. The Wolverines are 8.5-point favorites over the Badgers.</p>
<p>A few notable games that bettors believe will be close include No. 14 Florida (5-1) playing at Vanderbilt (3-3). The Gators are favored by just a touchdown. No. 6 West Virginia (5-0) could also have its hands full when the Mountaineers travel to Iowa State (2-3). The visitors are favored by just 6.5 points.</p>
<p>No Upset Here</p>
<p>No. 1 Alabama (6-0) is expected to have yet another ho-hum easy game when the Crimson Tide welcome Missouri (3-2). The defending national champs are favored by four touchdowns.</p>
<p>Alabama has played just one ranked team, No. 22 Texas A&amp;M, where they won 45-23.</p>
<p>Coach Nick Saban’s team is averaging 56 points per game, the most in the entire nation. Its defense gives up just 16 points per game.</p>
<p>After Missouri, Alabama plays Tennessee in a game that should be another sleeper for fans. The Crimson Tide’s season truly begins when they travel to LSU on November 3. Still, the ESPN Football Power Index Matchup Predictor gives Alabama an 80 percent chance of winning.</p>
