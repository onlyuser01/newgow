<p>This exciting partnership will see Trustly become the exclusive payments provider for the newly launched NFT loyalty marketplace STN Charms</p>
<p>Collaborating with Station Casinos showcases the integration of cutting-edge technology and innovative gaming concepts, bringing players a seamless and secure payment experience within NFT-based loyalty programs. The partnership will bolster both companies’ long-term objectives, strengthening their market presence and demonstrating the benefits of strategic collaborations.</p>
<p>Players Will Benefit from Quick and Efficient Payments</p>
<p>STN Charms, launched by Station Casinos on 31 March, introduces players to a unique loyalty concept. The platform allows players to earn digital charms that can be collected, levelled up, bought, and sold on the marketplace. This concept adds a new dimension to traditional loyalty programs, leveraging NFT technology to create engaging and valuable player rewards.</p>
<p>As the exclusive payments provider for STN Charms, Trustly will power the platform’s payments infrastructure. Players can use Trustly’s Open Banking Payments solution to facilitate secure and instant deposits and withdrawals within their STN Charms wallet. Trustly’s VP of Gaming, John Parsons, noted that the project highlighted the benefits of an integral payment system for the members-only marketplace.</p>
<p>Our work with (Station Casinos) has allowed us to show how Open Banking technology can assist in creating a ground-breaking loyalty program. John Parsons, Trustly VP of Gaming</p>
<p>Trustly will collaborate with CentralAMS, which currently powers Station Casinos’ digital wallets and is the operator’s merchant of record. This three-way partnership creates a convenient and user-friendly experience for players, allowing them to manage their funds within the NFT loyalty marketplace. Such convenience is paramount to creating a healthy financial ecosystem, empowering users to capitalize on their successes.</p>
<p>Trustly Remains at the Forefront of Innovation</p>
<p>The collaboration between Trustly and Station Casinos highlights the growing convergence between online payments and innovative gaming concepts. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have gained immense popularity for their ability to monetize unique digital assets, and the integration of NFTs into the loyalty marketplace concept adds a new layer of excitement for players.</p>
<p>Trustly’s involvement in this project underscores its commitment to supporting the gaming industry’s evolution by delivering cutting-edge payment solutions that enhance player engagement and satisfaction. Such initiatives will be instrumental for the company’s ambitious expansion efforts as it leverages its recent purchases to create a robust and cutting-edge payment system.</p>
<p>By partnering with Station Casinos in powering STN Charms, Trustly continues to solidify its position as a leading player in the Open Banking payments space. Creating exceptional experiences in traditional and emerging gaming concepts perfectly aligns with the company’s long-term goals as it aims to solidify its palace as one of the industry’s go-to payment providers.</p>
