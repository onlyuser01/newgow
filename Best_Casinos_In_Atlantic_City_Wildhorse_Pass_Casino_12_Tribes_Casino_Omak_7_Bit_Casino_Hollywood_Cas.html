<p>Kindred seeks to be a positive influence and promote initiatives such as the MFC Foundation’s programs</p>
<p>Kindred Group, the principal club sponsor of Middlesbrough FC, has vowed to donate its front-of-shirt sponsorship space for the upcoming match against Millwall FC. According to the gambling operator, its logo will be temporarily replaced by the logo of the MFC Foundation.</p>
<p>Kindred, which is the company behind leading betting brands such as 32Red and Unibet, said that the move seeks to draw attention to the foundation’s award-winning work. MFC Foundation’s work consists in raising aspirations and improving the life chances of people across Teesside.</p>
<p>The increased visibility will promote the non-profit’s invaluable work. For reference, MFC Foundation’s activities are supported and funded by a number of influential commercial partners, such as Kindred Group.</p>
<p>Kindred is also a supporter of MFC Foundation’s Think With Your Feet, a program that enables local men to meet, play soccer and discuss their mental health issues.</p>
<p>In addition to donating its front-of-shirt sponsorship space for the upcoming match weekend, Kindred also donated its hospitality access to the Millwall fixture to participant from MFC Foundation’s Walking Football and East Cleveland Fitness sessions.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Boro’s players will also wear MFC Foundation’s logo during the warm up session on Saturday.</p>
<p>Kindred Group Is Committed to Making a Change</p>
<p>Kindred Group’s managing director for the UK, Neil Banbury, explained that the company is determined to implement a new kind of sponsorship model. To that end, Kindred seeks to be a positive influence and promote initiatives such as the MFC Foundation’s programs.</p>
<p>We are in a position to positively influence clubs and communities and take that responsibility seriously. That’s why it’s great to be able to highlight MFC Foundation – and its range of work across the region – in this weekend’s game. Neil Banbury, MD UK, Kindred Group</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lynsey Edwards, MFC Foundation’s head, thanked Kindred for its support, praising the opportunity to reinforce the importance of MFC Foundation to the wider soccer community.</p>
<p>We’re grateful to the support from our partners that supports the varied work we do across the region, and we look forward to building on that in the months ahead. Lynsey Edwards, head, MFC Foundation</p>
