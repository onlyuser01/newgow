<p>FanDuel is shining the spotlight on golf as one of North America’s biggest sports betting companies is choosing to go for a tailored approach to promoting its market and driving interest in them.</p>
<p>FanDuel Puts Emphasis on Golf Contests</p>
<p>As a result, the company introduced a new commercial that will feature Jordan Spieth, a three-time major winner, and other notable golfers from the PGA Tour, including Will Zalatoris, Abraham Ancer, and Harold Varner III.</p>
<p>FanDuel is the official partner of the PGA Tour, which puts the betting giant in a unique position to leverage its assets and introduce sports fans to a yet new and equally-intriguing sport. While golf is still more of an acquired taste, betting on legal golf has surged in recent years.</p>
<p>In addition to appearing in FanDuel’s new commercial, Spieth, Ancer, Zalatoris and Varner will partner with FanDuel on social media support, which will include odds boosts and content surrounding FanDuel Free-to-Play initiatives. FanDuel statement</p>
<p>The new marketing campaign coincides with the US Open which is getting underway on Thursday at The Country Club in Brookline. FanDuel hopes that its marketing campaign will be a more sustained effort to bring more sports fans into the golf fold. The ad is slated to run through February 23 and comes with a dedicated $200 bonus available as free bets.</p>
<p>How Big Is Golf in the United States Really?</p>
<p>Naturally, FanDuel has noted the untapped potential of golf fans and sports bettors who finally have a legitimate betting option on their hand. Following this logic, the company has decided to move golf to its own category and push for it to become a more prominent pick among recreational and sharp bettors.</p>
<p>Mike Raffensperger, FanDuel Group CMO, has confirmed that the PGA Tour partnership has enabled FanDuel to boost the popularity of the sport and elicit stronger betting action. The two companies have worked together for almost a year now, since signing their partnership in August 2021.</p>
<p>Over that time, FanDuel has shown active interest in PGA Tour, promoting the tour on its official media channels and running distinct promotional materials. But it’s not just some outlandish appreciation for golf that FanDuel has.</p>
<p>Rather, the company is aware that the market is underserved and that it has the means to tap into a market full of sports fans who are eager to spend on bets watching golf.</p>
