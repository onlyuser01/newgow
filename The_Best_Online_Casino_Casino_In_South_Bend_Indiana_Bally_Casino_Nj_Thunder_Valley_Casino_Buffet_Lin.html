<p>The 2023 NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race is on the program on Sunday, November 5, at Phoenix Raceway, where four drivers will race for the title. Read our NASCAR Championship prediction to see who we think will become the 2023 champ</p>
<p>It’s time for the biggest NASCAR Cup Series race of 2023! The grand finale of the 2023 season is happening this coming Sunday in Phoenix where one of the drivers that made it to the Championship 4 will become the new champion.</p>
<p>Yes, the NASCAR Cup Series is going to get a new champion because last year’s winner Joey Logano failed to survive the Playoffs cut-off. Instead, the following four drivers are competing for the 2023 NASCAR title – Ryan Blaney, Christopher Bell, Kyle Larson, and William Byron.</p>
<p>As per NASCAR rules, each driver from the Championship 4 has 5000 ranking points, meaning that the previous results won’t matter in Phoenix. Instead, the one driver who finishes the race before the other three will be crowned the champion. This, however, doesn’t mean that they need to actually win the race. Anyone can do it, but judging by the 2023 NASCAR Phoenix odds, it’s likely that it’s gonna be one of the Championship 4 drivers.</p>
<p>2023 NASCAR Championship Race Odds</p>
<p>Driver Odds Kyle Larson +160 Ryan Blaney +260 William Byron +325 Christopher Bell +450 Kevin Harvick +1800 Tyler Reddick +2200 Denny Hamlin +2200 Martin Truex Jr +2500 Joey Logano +2800 Brad Keselowski +5000 Chase Briscoe +5500 Kyle Busch +6000 Chris Buescher +6600 Ross Chastain +7500 Chase Elliott +7500 Ty Gibbs +7500 Bubba Wallace +12500 Daniel Suarez +15000 Alex Bowman +15000 Aric Almirola +15000</p>

<p>Championship 4 Drivers Favored to Win in Phoenix</p>
<p>The four drivers that are competing for the title are seen as the top four favorites to win the 2023 Phoenix race. This, however, doesn’t mean that one of them actually needs to win this race to get ahold of the trophy. Instead, the new champ just needs to do better than the competition.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at the 2023 Championship 4 drivers who will compete for the NASCAR Cup Series title on Sunday. Kyle Larson comes in to Phoenix as the only past champion of this group.#kylelarson #yungmoney #nascar75 #hendrickcars #championship4 #phoenixraceway pic.twitter.com/hzeMOEOwn0 — Larson Land (@LarsonLand) October 30, 2023</p>
<p>Nevertheless, each of the Championship 4 drivers is super-motivated to win on November 5, not to mention that they all seem to love this event. Each of them finished in the Top 10 last season, with Kyle Larson being the one that’s already won this race in the past. He did it in 2021, which brought the championship his way.</p>
<p>Can he do the same thing again two years later? According to the 2023 Championship Race odds, the answer is yes. The Hendrick Motorsports driver is the No. 1 favorite to win the Phoenix race with odds of +160. Some may think of this as surprising given that he finished outside the Top 10 in four of his last six races.</p>
<p>Each of the other three drivers from Championship 4 has been in better form than him, most notably, Ryan Blaney, who won last weekend’s race.</p>
<p>2023 NASCAR Championship Race Prediction</p>
<p>Surprises do happen in Phoenix, but we think one of the Championship 4 is going to win the race on Sunday. But we don’t think it’s going to be the No. 1 favorite Kyle Larson. Instead, our pick is Ryan Blaney. This guy wasn’t too great in the regular season, but since the start of the Playoffs, the Team Penske driver has been fantastic.</p>
<p>Pick: Ryan Blaney to win</p>
