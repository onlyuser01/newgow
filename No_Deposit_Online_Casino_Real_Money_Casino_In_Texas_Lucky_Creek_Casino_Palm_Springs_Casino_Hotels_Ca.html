    <h1>No Deposit Online Casino Real Money Casino In Texas Lucky Creek Casino Palm Springs Casino Hotels Ca</h1>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I'll make this hopefully short and sweet.</p>
<p>Background -</p>
<p>Been with Magical spin for approx 3 years, successful deposits, successful use of vpns for certain desired software play, bonuses successfully recieved according to deposit ratio, no problems what so ever.</p>
<p>Issue -</p>
<p>Entire history and activity erased from my active account (even when a deposit was successfully made within the 30days of the issue). Absolutely no data held in any of the betting, transaction, deposits, bonuses logs.</p>
<p>Made contact with live chat to initially request my monthly cash back bonus which is normally automatically applied from the 1st to the 5th of every month. (This has never been something I've needed to do, hence automatically added)</p>
<p>I argued with the representative regarding my account being actively used over a period of 3 years, where she was stating this to be incorrect they state that the account has NEVER had any active sessions, no deposits made or literally anything accessed prior to connecting with them.</p>
<p>After several minutes, they closed the chat.</p>
<p>I had then contacted them again with this issue roughly 4 more times via chat, still resulting in the same responses. I then contacted support and they handballed back to chat stating this kind of issue they could deal with. I wasn't taking no for an answer.</p>
<p>They then tried adding free spins to my account after I had successfully convinced them (with emails as proof in deposits) that I'd been on the site for years. These spins didn't not allow me to play the games (vpn tried from several countries via several vpn provider apps) they then swapped it for cash balance of $5 aud, this still resulted in game errors.</p>
<p>I contacted support AGAIN with screenshots.</p>
<p>Please see the attachment of the emails back and forth with no resolution.</p>
<p>Remembering that this all began AFTER My account was wiped yet they won't deal with the issue.</p>
<p>Get_game_link_game_not_available is the error, is that not an error where an account has not been fully activated interms of command prompts or something similar? I.e - Software - enabled/disabled - Disabled kinda issue</p>
<p>Hope all this makes sense</p>
<p>The attachment "screenshot" labelled ones are the attempts via chat to have the issue resolved. (There are many more chat related screenshots where the casino reps are handballing back and forth but I was unable to attach these due to Max limit for attachments etc)</p>
<p>The most important attachments are the magical spin support email attachment and the error message attachment.</p>
<p>Basically my question is: this get_game_link_game_not_available error is not something I can handle at my end is it? As stated I have used the recommended VPN app they gave me (windcribe) connected successfully to many locations including the recommended Japan, Norway, Canada etc locations they had asked me too so from where stand this is</p>
<p>MagicalSpins technical department related issue, correct?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Kleigh</p>
