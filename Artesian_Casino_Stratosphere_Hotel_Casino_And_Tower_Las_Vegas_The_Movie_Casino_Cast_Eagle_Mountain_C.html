<p>Sports Bettors Like Los Angeles Rams for Super Bowl, Las Vegas Likes New England Patriots</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Rams are taking more Super Bowl money than any other team in the NFL, as bettors are rushing to print ticket slips on the longest odds possible.</p>

<p>After opening as long as 20/1, oddsmakers have shortened the Rams’ Super Bowl odds due to a flurry of activity on the 2017 NFC West champions. The Westgate SuperBook currently has the team at just 10/1 to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy.</p>
<p>Westgate football oddsmaker Ed Salmons tells ESPN that in addition to the Los Angeles Rams, the sportsbook has taken considerable money on another California team. Salmons says despite going 6-10 last year, the San Francisco 49ers have plenty of gamblers believing in their 2018 chances.</p>
<p>“Both of those teams (Rams and 49ers) have difficult schedules, but the public has shown just a ton of support for them,” Salmons stated.</p>
<p>The 49ers won five straight to end their season after acquiring quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo from the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Odds</p>
<p>Despite the Rams taking the most money at the SuperBook, oddsmakers online and in Las Vegas still believe the Patriots are once again the team to beat.</p>
<p>The SuperBook has Tom Brady’s squad at just 6/1 to win Super Bowl LIII, which will be held February 3, 2019, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Should the Pats win their third title in five years, each $100 bet will net $600.</p>
<p>The defending champion Philadelphia Eagles are next at 8/1 along with the Pittsburgh Steelers. After the Rams, it’s the Minnesota Vikings (12/1) rounding out the top five.</p>
<p>As for the winless Cleveland Browns, there’s actually been some action on the Ohio team for Super Bowl 53. After opening at 250/1 at online sportsbook Bovada, the site has shortened their championship odds to 100/1.</p>
<p>If the Browns pull off the seemingly impossible and win their first Super Bowl, a $100 wager would net $10,000 on the current line.</p>
<p>Season Win Totals</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook recently unveiled odds on season win totals for each of the NFL’s 32 teams. And not surprisingly, the Patriots top the list with 11 wins.</p>
<p>The Eagles and Steelers are next at 10.5, followed by the Green Bay Packers and Vikings at 10 wins. The SuperBook has the Rams at 9.5 wins.</p>
<p>As for those Browns, the 0-16 squad is listed at 5.5 wins at the SuperBook. They aren’t alone in the NFL gutter, as the Arizona Cardinals share the same win total.</p>
<p>While the Patriots have won 12 or more games in eight straight seasons, oddsmakers say there’s some concern this year due to Brady being 41-years-old when the regular season begins. “There just isn’t as much margin of error for the Patriots at this point,” Salmons explained.</p>
<p>Prior to the 2017 season, the SuperBook had the Patriots’ win total at 12.5. Bets on the over won, as New England went 13-3.</p>
