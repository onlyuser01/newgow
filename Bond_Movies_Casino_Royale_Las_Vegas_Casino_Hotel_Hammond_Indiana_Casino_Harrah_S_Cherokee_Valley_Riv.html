    <h1>Bond Movies Casino Royale Las Vegas Casino Hotel Hammond Indiana Casino Harrah S Cherokee Valley Riv</h1>

<p>Good evening. I hope you're well. On the 13th of October, I made my first deposit at this particular casino. I also took their welcome sports bonus package. I deposited 200 euros and received another 200 euro bonus. For 1.5 days, everything was fine until Sunday. Suddenly, on Sunday, I couldn't place bets and no error messages were displayed. To this day, 4 days later, despite several emails and live chats, the problem has not been fixed. Not only that, but they can't even provide any information about the issue. All I get are the same old reassurances that they regret the inconvenience and that they'll fix the issue promptly. As I said, my account has the bonus enabled and after 1.5 days of play (I've been unable to play the other 4), my remaining balance is 511 euros. The bonus rollover period is 14 days and expires on the 27th of October. These 4 days that I've been unable to play count against my rollover period. I believe this is the root problem with betting. They're probably waiting for the 27th to roll around and the system will automatically cancel my bonus since it hasn't been rolled over, forfeiting all worth 510 euros including my 200 euro deposit. After that, all I'll have to back up my claims will be their emails. My account balance will be zero, the bonus will have been legitimately cancelled and they'll just play dumb. Please, if you can, say something to them because this betting issue seems to have been deliberately engineered by them so I wouldn't complete the rollover in time and lose my entire balance.</p>
