<p>Thank you for your response, Drift Casino.</p>
<p>We accept that it is the responsibility of players to make sure that they don't create multiple accounts at the same casino. Not because we think it's the right way to do it, but because it's the industry standard, and we cannot penalize all casinos that don't enforce the 'one account per player' rule the way we consider best.</p>
<p>However, in accordance with our fair gambling codex (https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#duplicate-accounts), we do believe that each case should be considered separately.</p>
<p>If the casino finds out that a player has created many separate accounts and used the full bonus amount on each of them, it is likely that this is a bonus abuser, and the casino has every right to penalize them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a casual player mistakenly creates two accounts and doesn't use them both to play bonuses that should only be received once per player, or to gain some other unfair advantage, the casino shouldn't necessarily penalize them just because it has a rule that can be used against them.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the casino is acting in accordance with its Terms and Conditions and do not dispute that the player has opened two accounts, but feel that the circumstances surrounding this should be explored further if winnings are confiscated.</p>
<p>Can I please ask the casino to provide further information regarding this?</p>
