<p>The newly created German regulator Gemeinsamen Glücksspielbehörde der Länder (Gambling Authority of the Federal States of Germany – GGL) has announced it was prepared to take on the task of regulating the transnational online gaming market in the country. The announcement was made after the Gambling College met for the last time on December 13. At the end of the meeting, members of the body responsible for making decisions regarding federal gambling regulations handed over their files to the GGL in a symbolic act. Now, the GGL is ready to start tackling its chores.</p>
<p>Important Milestone Reached</p>
<p>According to GGL board member Ronald Benter, “an important milestone of the State Treaty on Gaming 2021 has been reached.” Benter spoke about the extra competencies that the GGL team will bring to the table that is expected to boost the regulation of the online gambling market and carry it to a whole new level. The main task that has been the object of the important transfer refers to the GGL supervising the regulation of the German gambling market that will take effect starting January 1, 2023. The main responsibilities of the GGL will be to assess all gambling providers and give them the necessary approval at a national level. This will be done by making sure that all gambling providers holding a valid permit will correctly adhere to the current rules meant to protect gamblers against gambling harm, addiction, and manipulation.</p>
<p>The GGL has already started taking legal action against gambling providers outside the law as well as against advertisements targeting their services starting July 1, 2022.</p>
<p>The GGL to Take Remits from Different German States</p>
<p>In the past, federal gambling regulation has been handled by several state-level departments. This means that the freshly empowered regulator will be busy taking different remits from different states. For example, the federal state of Sachsen-Anhalt will transfer its virtual slot machine and online poker brief, while Hamburg will hand over its commercial lotteries. Finally, Hessen will transfer its sports and horse race betting, Niedersachsen will hand over its lottery brokerage, and Rheinland-Pfalz will hand over its charitable lotteries.</p>
<p>GGL board member Benjamin Schwanke explained the regulator was fully prepared to get started. Schwanke spoke about the “appropriate structures and processes” that have been set up and completed for the regulation of the online gaming market starting next year. The GGL expects to use the Gambling College’s expertise and experience to its benefit. The regulator expects to hire around 20 new experts from the Saxony-Anhalt State Administration Office at the head of the new year. The fresh employees will bring their expertise regarding the licensing and supervisory methods applied to online poker and online slot machines.</p>
