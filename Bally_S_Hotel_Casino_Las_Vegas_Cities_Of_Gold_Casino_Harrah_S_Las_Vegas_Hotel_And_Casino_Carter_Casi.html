<p>Super Group Limited has extended its global footprint in the US by acquiring Digital Gaming Corporation, getting access to 12 new markets</p>
<p>The NYSE-listed international digital gaming company that offers first-class entertainment confirmed the acquisition of the online gambling and sports betting company that offers market access in a dozen US states, including eight live markets.</p>
<p>The new deal will allow Betway’s and Spin’s parent company to further expand its global presence in the US by entering these markets and continuing its profitable growth in the region.</p>
<p>Super Growth, “Well-Positioned to Enter the US market”</p>
<p>Super Group’s chief executive officer Neal Menashe expressed excitement for being able to officially usher DGC into the group while looking forward to starting working “more closely” with them in their endeavor to apply their already proven toolkit to the US market.</p>
<p>Menashe also spoke about the group’s “healthy balance sheet” and “consistent track record of driving profitable growth”, both of which recommended Super Group as a good candidate for penetrating the American market.</p>
<p>At the moment, DGC is live in Arizona, Iowa, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado, Indiana, and Ohio. All of these states are already making use of the Betway brand exclusively licensed from Super Group. In Q1, DGC plans to also go live in Louisiana and this way become the fourth state to benefit from the Betway Global technology platform, alongside Ohio, Virginia, and Arizona.</p>
<p>Ohio, the Freshest US State to Host the Betway Brand via DGC</p>
<p>Last Sunday, DGC launched the Betway brand in the Buckeye State via a partnership agreement signed with Belterra Park owned by Boyd Gaming. This prompted Ohio to turn into the freshest US state to give the green light to the regulated market for sports betting.</p>
<p>DGC’s executive vice president Bruce Watemeyer expressed their thrill to be going live “in the great state of Ohio” and also to be able to get access to sports aficionados across the state. He also called the decision “an important step” for the company busy expanding its “best-in-class offerings”.</p>
<p>The company that calls itself “the home of premium online gaming solutions” has been busy investing in Ohio through its partnership with the Cleveland Cavaliers that began in February 2021. Now, DGC is eager to finally welcome sports fans from Ohio to the Betway experience. Super Group has several licenses in various global jurisdictions and it is a premier name in important markets in Europe, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>The group’s online gambling and sports betting options are backed up by top-tier technology, which allows its quick and effective entry into new markets worldwide. The group’s customer experience is a fully customizable one thanks to the proprietary data analytics and marketing engine. In November, the group announced its third-quarter results for 2022 were in line with its full-year guidance.</p>
