    <h1>Boulder Station Casino Casino Martin Scorsese Western Village Hotel Casino Sparks Nevada Wind Creek</h1>

<p>There are thousands of slots belonging to the buffalo genre, but not all of them rise up to players’ expectations. Yggdrasil and Jelly’s fresh release is one of the gems in the industry. The game introduces players to a peaceful atmosphere with lots of American Indian elements, a gorgeous national park in the background, and a relaxing soundtrack. The game incorporates Yggdrasil’s Game Engagement Mechanic and it is packed with colossal Gigablox symbols that can easily reach impressive 4×4 sizes.</p>

<p>Buffalo Blox Gigablox Symbols, Free Spins &amp; Buffalo Bets</p>
<p>The American Indian culture is omnipresent in this collaboration between independent real-money game studio Jelly and the leading publisher of online gaming content Yggdrasil. The game is packed with symbols of totems, dream catchers, and feathers which give it a noble feel. The new slot counts 12 characters ranging from low-paying cards to high-paying symbols like eagles, wolves, buffalos, and bears. Buffalo Blox Gigablox counts two special symbols, the wild symbol represented by a coin and the scatter symbol represented by a diamond).</p>
<p>A minimum of six coins triggers wins between 2x and 1,000x during the base game. A minimum of five scatters triggers the free spins round supervised by the majestic buffalos roaming the beautiful Native American lands.</p>
<p>To trigger the free spins, players must land a minimum of five scatters. Once an activation has been completed, players will clearly see the exact number of free spins they will receive for each diamond symbol, ranging between one and two free spins. The total number of free games is represented by the sum of the numbers displayed on the diamond symbols. While playing a free game, players get a chance to hit even greater wins in exchange for fewer coins.</p>
<p>Players are also given the opportunity to pay an extra 25% of their original bet size to double up their shots of activating the Free Spins games.</p>
<p>GATI-Powered Slot</p>
<p>The new release belongs to Yggdrasil’s Masters portfolio and it was created with the help of the provider’s prestigious GATI technology. GATI allows Yggdrasil’s partners to use readily configured toolkits to develop new games and create fast-moving games with top features.</p>
<p>The company’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy spoke about Jelly’s consistent “great” game releases with the help of the same YG Masters program in the past couple of years. McCarthy added the new release was “certainly no expectation” while emphasizing that these successful games highlight “the value that a great mechanic can have to enhance the player experience.”</p>
<p>Jelly’s marketing lead Victoria Newbolt expressed the company’s delight to be able to use the Gigablox mechanic in one of their releases.</p>
<p>At the end of May, Yggdrasil collaborated with Bang Bang Games for the release of a retro slot game called Jokrz Wild ULTRANUDGE. At the same time, Yggdrasil and Jelly launched Big Benji Bonanza, a popular Wall Street-themed game with the Super Staxx free spins proprietary mechanic.</p>
