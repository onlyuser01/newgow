<p>Information about Amaya casinos</p>
<p>Amaya Inc., now trading under the name The Stars Group Inc. (TSG), is a major provider of interactive gaming products and services and owns a wide range of gaming brands, including PokerStars, BetStars and Full Tilt. TSG Inc. itself operates within Flutter Entertainment plc, a result of a merger between the two giants to form one of the biggest betting companies in the world.</p>
<p>While TSG represents one of the largest poker enterprises in the world – running and sponsoring many international events – they also offer non-poker gaming products such as casino games and sports betting.</p>
<p>On this page, you'll be able to see a selection of online casinos with Amaya (or TSG) games. You'll also be able to read about Amaya's history, including how it became TSG, along with details on how to choose the best Amaya online casino and bonuses offered by these sites.</p>

<p>Amaya - the poker specialist now part of one of the world's largest gaming entities</p>
<p>Amaya Gaming started life back in 2004 by creating land-based solutions for casinos and betting operators in Canada, but quickly transferred to the online betting industry with the growing popularity of internet gaming. The company became a leader in interactive casino, sports betting and lottery software, and acquired several prominent betting firms as their success grew.</p>
<p>The company hit the headlines in 2014 by announcing a $4.9 billion acquisition of Rational Group — the parent company of PokerStars and Full Tilt — making Amaya the largest public online gaming company in the world – it also placed them at the forefront of a hugely popular online poker market.</p>
<p>Yet less than two years later, Amaya suffered a huge controversy. CEO David Baazov was hit by five charges of insider trading from AMF, Quebec's securities regulator. The scandal rocked the company and Baazov, who had helped build Amaya into a gaming giant, was forced to quit the company.</p>
<p>Note: The controversy paved the way for the company to rebrand to The Stars Group in 2017 in an effort to distance itself from its former CEO. It also moved its headquarters from Montreal to Toronto, and traded under the initials TSG or TSGI — a nod to the success of its Stars franchises, including PokerStars.</p>
<p>Amaya (or TSG) has since gone from strength-to-strength in the gaming industry by expanding further into non-poker markets while retaining its position near the top of the online poker industry. In 2019, it announced a gigantic $11 billion merger with Flutter Entertainment that saw Flutter as the dominant partner. The new company boasted five divisions, housing major betting exchanges like Paddy Power, Betfair and SkyBet.</p>
<p>Today, players should feel safe using TSG content under the Flutter name. The company is a member of the UK's Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) which is dedicated to safe gambling and protecting consumers.</p>
<p>Amaya games and software</p>
<p>A quick look through our selection of Amaya slots will reveal a broad range of themes and styles, which is down to the various subsidiary and partner companies that Amaya employs to develop them — as well as the company producing some in-house titles.</p>
<p>Many of the titles feature superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, thanks to a 2013 agreement between Amaya and Warner Bros. to exclusively develop DC-Comics-inspired slots games. A similar deal with Paramount means you'll also see movie-based titles like Forrest Gump and the Italian Job. A key aim appears to make bright and bold graphics that grab the player's attention, and you can also see this in non-franchise offering such as Enchanted Beans and Rags to Riches.</p>
<p>Note: You can try out these games for free in our list of free Amaya slots: it makes sense to do this before staking money to see if they're worth playing for real.</p>
<p>As well as slots, the company also offers a range of online poker games under its various poker subsidiaries — Poker Stars being the most famous — along with table games and fixed odds games.</p>
<p>Amaya's games are powered by modern software that loads quickly and is well-equipped for mobile games as well as desktop versions. Its content is translated into over 20 different languages, making it accessible around the world. The software is extremely secure and comes with an RSA 2048-bit code-signing certificate from VeriSign that guarantees its authenticity.</p>
<p>How to choose the best Amaya casino online</p>
<p>Amaya, or TSG, have a top reputation for providing highly secure gaming content, but this doesn't necessarily mean we can say the same about all the sites that use it. As such, we need to be sure to find a safe Amaya casino to play on, and this page is designed to help us do that.</p>

<p>How to find Amaya casino bonuses</p>
<p>Casino bonuses are popular with players as they offer extra credit or spins once you make a deposit – deposit (welcome bonuses) — or even before you put any money down at all, like with no deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>To find bonuses offered by Amaya casinos, simply head to our list of casino bonuses and find 'Amaya' in the game provider filter. You might want a particular bonus type, in which case go to the 'Bonus Type' filter and select the 'No Deposit Bonus' box, for example. You can also see these by going to list of no deposit bonuses and selecting 'Amaya'.</p>
<p>Every bonus that you see will be completely relevant and up to date due to our team's diligent work.</p>
