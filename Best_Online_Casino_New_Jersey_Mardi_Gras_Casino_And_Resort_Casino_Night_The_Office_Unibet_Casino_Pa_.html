    <h1>Best Online Casino New Jersey Mardi Gras Casino And Resort Casino Night The Office Unibet Casino Pa</h1>

<p>The global provider of content for the iGaming industry offering unique products that stand out with quality and innovation, Pragmatic Play, announced it expanded the reach of its leading portfolio. The company revealed Wednesday it joined forces with Pasino.ch, the famous Partouche Groupe-owned brand.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, the leading content from Pragmatic Play is now available for Pasino.ch customers. This collaboration significantly expanded the leading developer's presence in Switzerland. What's more, the new deal expanded Pragmatic Play's European footprint as well.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, which is already live, Pasino.ch customers can enjoy popular titles from the leading developer such as Sweet Bonanza and The Hand of Midas. Additionally, the partnership delivers award-winning games such as Big Bass Bonanza and Gates of Olympus for customers of the brand. The latest deal significantly expands the operator's offering, considering that its customers can benefit from Pragmatic Play's complete portfolio of slots.</p>
<p>In a statement released on January 4, 2023, Rupert Ecker, the Managing Director of Pasino.ch, explained that the brand as well as Group Partouche are focused on delivering high-quality entertainment for its customers. "Pragmatic Play's range of games is thus another important partner and delivers a further upgrade to our licensed Swiss online casino with its popular games," he added.</p>
<p>Ecker said that the brand is excited to deliver such a large number of quality titles for its customers. Finally, he predicted that Pragmatic Play's content will be well-received by Pasino.ch customers.</p>
<p>The latest deal in Switzerland helps Pragmatic Play solidify its leadership position as a developer and provider of iGaming content for the online gambling industry in Europe. In fact, late last month, the company boosted its presence in Italy via a deal with Sportbet, a leading operator in the country.</p>
<p>Before that, again in December, Pragmatic Play joined forces with mycasino. This collaboration boosted further the company's Swiss market presence. Besides Europe, last month Pragmatic Play expanded its footprint in Brazil as well via a collaboration with Aposta Ganha, a popular operator in the country.</p>
<p>Speaking about the rollout of content for Pasino.ch, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, Irina Cornides, said: "The Partouche Groupe is a big name in land-based casino, and its Pasino brand brings that well-deserved reputation online."</p>
<p>"We are proud to be in perfect alignment with the group's aim of providing high-quality entertainment, and it presents the perfect opportunity for us to put our award-winning games in front of even more players and grow our footprint in the Swiss market," said Cornides in conclusion.</p>
