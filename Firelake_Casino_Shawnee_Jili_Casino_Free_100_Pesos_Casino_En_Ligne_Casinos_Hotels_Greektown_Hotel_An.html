<p>CES 2023, one of the most-anticipated events showcasing leading technology from around the world, wrapped up on Sunday, enjoying an increase in visitation ahead of the initial expectations</p>
<p>Famous as one the most influential tech event in the world, CES 2023 started January 5 and ran through January 8, 2023. The event enjoyed an increase in visitation, as it gathered more than 115,000 industry experts, data released by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), the owner and producer of the event, revealed.</p>
<p>More than Visitors 115,000 Attend CES 2023</p>
<p>Considering the impact of the pandemic and the spread of omicron, last year’s edition of the event drew less than 50,000 attendees. In contrast, the usual CES attendees are approximately 170,000. Although this year’s CES didn’t surpass that number, the 115,000 pre-audit attendees marked the highest number of visitors for a global tech event since 2020. What’s more, the number of attendees for the latest event surpassed the expectations of the organizers.</p>
<p>Additional details released by the CTA reveal that this year’s event was held at a 70% larger space than CES 2022. In fact, CES 2023 used nearly 2.2 million net square feet of space at The Venetian Expo and the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>
<p>The Popularity of In-Person Events Returns</p>
<p>The prestigious tech event attracted more than 3,200 exhibitors. From that total, approximately 1,000 were new exhibitors. There was an estimate of 40,000 international attendees from more than 140 countries around the globe at CES 2023, judging by pre-audit figures of the organizer.</p>
<p>The CTA estimates that there were 4,800 media members from 69 different countries attending the CES 2023. Last but not least, some 60% of Fortune 500 companies were represented at the prestigious tech event. Giants within different industries such as Google, Canon, Delta, Amazon, Bosch, Samsung, Panasonic and Microsoft, among many others attended the recent edition of the event.</p>
<p>“CES 2023 was the great reconnection and rocked by every measure – from attendance to the keynote stage to press conferences and product debuts on the exhibit floor – showing the entire world that in-person events are BACK!“ Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, CTA</p>
<p>Gary Shapiro, CTA’s president and CEO, acknowledged that the visitation of the CES soared for this year’s event. He outlined that the increase in visitation reaffirmed that after the interruption enforced by the pandemic, the popularity of in-person events is back. In conclusion, Shapiro predicted that the innovations presented at the CES 2023 will help by delivering new ways to “improve our lives and create a better future for the next generation.”</p>
<p>The 2024 edition of the tech event is planned to take place in Las Vegas between January 9 and January 12, 2024. Additional details regarding the event can be expected in due time.</p>
