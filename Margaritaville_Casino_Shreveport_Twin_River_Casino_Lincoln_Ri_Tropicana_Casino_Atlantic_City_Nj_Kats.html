    <h1>Margaritaville Casino Shreveport Twin River Casino Lincoln Ri Tropicana Casino Atlantic City Nj Kats</h1>

<p>Hi Kristina! Thank you for responding so quickly!</p>
<p>I wish I could say the verification seems to be the only issue, however as I said in my first message (as of yesterday, November 10th) I am no longer even able to log in. It doesn't say my account is terminated, but that the "site is down for maintenance".</p>
<p>I joined on October 12th, and I have an email stating I was fully verified on the same day (I uploaded the 3 main items they requested).</p>
<p>I made deposits on October 13th, 14th and 17th of $30 neosurf vouchers each.</p>
<p>On October 20th I received my first rejection, requesting a selfie holding my ID, which I fulfilled on the same day via email to the security address I was given by the online chat.</p>
<p>The following week, in October 27th I received my second rejection. To which I replied again with all requested documentation including what they ask for on my profile just for safe measure.</p>
<p>I received my last rejection on the 2nd of November with the same reason as the previous two, which is that "we are missing your handheld picture ID." Again, I sent over all information to both the security email and the support email.</p>
<p>After the second rejection I contacted their online chat, and during that conversation the chat option disappeared from my dashboard. I am no longer able to contact them from the website, but anyone else can (I have had 3 separate people now create accounts to see if the website is "under maintenance" for them (it's not) and if they can access the support chat (they can).</p>
<p>I have attached as well a screenshot from my inbox showing all of the outgoing emails fulfilling their requests, and absolutely no response from them minus the automated "rejected your withdrawal".</p>
<p>I reached out to them again yesterday with every document requested, and asked that we resolve this issue cordially before I am forced to go public with my complaints.</p>
<p>Again today, I am still unable to access my account.</p>
<p>I really don't like to complain or shame a company publicly, but I really have been backed into a corner here. I am getting no response, strange and erratic behavior from the website, and all after depositing.</p>
<p>I can email you proof of the vouchers as well if you'd like. Checking their balance through neosurf it shows where it was redeemed (I also have screenshots of this)</p>
<p>Where I was told to send the final document:</p>
<p>First submission of requested selfie:</p>
<p>Second and third:</p>
<p>All of the incoming and outgoing messages (a thread):</p>
<p>Please let me know anything else you need.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lindsay</p>
