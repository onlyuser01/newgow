<p>Relax Gaming has chosen StarCasino Italy for an exclusive early launch campaign for Money Train 4 ahead of the global launch</p>
<p>The popular aggregator and supplier of one-of-a-kind gaming content, Relax Gaming, has announced the exclusive early launch of its blockbuster game Money Train 4. The launch comes prior to the global launch of the latest title in the series.</p>
<p>StarCasino Italy, “Filled With Pride”</p>
<p>The rather humble head-start of the first game in the now epic Money Train series in 2019 did not foretell the massive success that the following games would record in 2020 (Money Train 2) and 2022 (Money Train 3).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the franchise managed to build up a solid and well-deserved reputation due to the extremely entertaining features and massive wins associated with the games.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the easily recognizable franchise has few competitors in the world of online gambling. The interesting crossover between video games and movies introduced by the fourth and latest title in the series, Money Train 4, follows the same formula of great success.</p>
<p>Correctly anticipating the uproar that the release of the fresh slot would cause worldwide, cherry-picked StarCasino Italy used the voice of managing director Stefano Tino to express their pride for being selected as the pioneer operator to host the game that would seal the iconic series.</p>
<p>Italian players accessing the StarCasino platform have been given the honor to access the fresh game straight out of Relax Gaming’s ovens one day ahead of the official global launch of the game scheduled for September 20.</p>
<p>Domestic players in the country will therefore be the first to try their luck at winning 150,000x their original stake with the help of the top features like the Respin Feature and the Money Cart Bonus Round.</p>
<p>The online casino that belongs to the reputable Betsson brand was created with the purpose of providing premium content to Italian players in the market, making the partnership with Relax Gaming a natural one.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming “Could Not Be Happier” to Offer Italians Early Exclusive Access</p>
<p>As acknowledged by Relax Gaming’s chief commercial officer, Nadiya Attard, StarCasino is a “fantastic brand” in Italy, the country that is rapidly turning into a top-ranking one for the provider. Accordingly, giving it access to the new release one day ahead of everyone else made perfect sense for the company.</p>
<p>Similarly, Star Casino Italy’s managing director, Stefano Tino, commented on the powerful sense of anticipation around the launch of the last title of the franchise, something that the entire team was looking forward to seeing.</p>
<p>Attard further added that Italians have already proven their passion for previous iterations of the series, with many of them being “huge” Money Train fans. As a result, Relax Gaming “could not be happier” to be able to provide them with early and exclusive access to the release a day early.</p>
<p>Greece is another European country where Relax Gaming likes to offer its content as part of its plan to expand globally. In April, the supplier inked a partnership with Betsson here right after signing a similar agreement with ng into a top-performing one for the provider.</p>
