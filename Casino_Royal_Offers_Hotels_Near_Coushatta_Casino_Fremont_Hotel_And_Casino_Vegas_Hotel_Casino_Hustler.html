<p>Service Organization Controls 2 (SOC 2) is a prestigious North American certification that recognizes the efforts of companies toward security policies, procedures and their dedication to ensuring the highest standard of data safety. On Thursday, the global gaming company, Kindred Group plc, announced that its flagship brand, Unibet, secured the recognizable SOC 2 certification. The company revealed that its brand, which is currently a leading provider of sports betting and gaming services has secured SOC 2 Type 2 compliance status for the market in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The certification follows an extensive probe that was led by MNP LLP. The auditor scrutinized and assessed Unibet’s current practices and controls. Additionally, the brand’s data management, risk assessment and access controls were also subject to evaluation. In addition to Unibet’s operations, MNP also looked into the systems and data collection of the brand’s Ontario partner, Pala Interactive. That probe, Kindred said, met the “Trust Service Criteria of security and processing integrity requirements.”</p>
<p>“Kindred have always been driving toward exceeding industry standards for information security and privacy.“ Sören Thörnlund, chief technology officer, Kindred Group</p>
<p>Sören Thörnlund, Kindred Group’s chief technology officer, explained that the achievement reaffirms the company’s commitment to ensuring the highest standards of information security within the industry. According to him, the protection of the company’s platform and customer data ensures “a safe and secure commercial offering to all our markets.” Finally, Thörnlund said that Kindred is delighted to see that its brand has secured SOC 2 certification, an achievement that complements the company’s core values.</p>
<p>The Certification Marks an Important Achievement for the Company</p>
<p>Amanda Brewer, Kindred Group’s country manager Canada, was excited about the new certification that recognizes the company’s dedication to the highest security standards for data and information security. She pointed out that the achievement confirms Kindred’s commitment to ensuring the safety of clients’ data. “It demonstrates our dedication to meeting and exceeding industry best practices while maintaining a high level of trust and confidence in our services,” said Brewer in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to announce our successful completion of SOC 2 (Type 2) audit without any reported exceptions.“ Amanda Brewer, country manager Canada, Kindred Group</p>
<p>The latest security certification comes after recently, Kindred announced a new collaboration with Matchis, the Dutch Center for Stem Cell Donors. Announced earlier this month, the collaboration seeks to help raise awareness about stem cell transplants and at the same time, help find donors for ill patients.</p>
