<p>Lottery.com’s freshly formed subsidiary Sports.com has inked a new multi-year partnership with Berlin-based leading provider of sports content to brands, media companies, and digital publishers Data Sports Group. The exclusive deal will allow the subsidiary of the popular technology company with a focus on lotteries to offer sports-focused content generated by Data Sports Group. Online publishes of digital content from all parts of the world will be granted access to the fresh content.</p>

<p>Sports.com will get access to content from major sports events and leagues including the Olympic Games, the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and the Professional Golf Association, along with a plethora of esports contests. Sports.com users will be provided with real-time results, in-game scoring, team rosters, event schedules, league standings, and tables, to name just a few of the available coverage. The sports data content will become available for mobile and web platforms and it will be covered in multiple languages.</p>
<p>Data Sports Group’s chief executive officer Sowbhagya Shett spoke about the new partnership, expressing their excitement for being chosen as the partner of Sports.com’s first sports data platform. Sheet added that Lottery.com had already proven its understanding of the “tremendous value of sports results and sports content” in the international digital content industry.
