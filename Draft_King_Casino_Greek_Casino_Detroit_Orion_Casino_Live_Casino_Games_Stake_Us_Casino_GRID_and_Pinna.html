    <h1>Draft King Casino Greek Casino Detroit Orion Casino Live Casino Games Stake Us Casino GRID and Pinna</h1>

<p>Pinnacle continues to build upon its momentum in the esports segment by expanding its multiyear partnership with GRID for a fifth year</p>
<p>The extended collaboration will focus on the continuation of the Pinnacle Cup Series, a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive competition that has been accepted well by the esports community and is Pinnacle’s further dedication to the vertical.</p>
<p>Entering the Fifth Year of Successful Esports Partnership</p>
<p>GRID and Pinnacle are collaborating for high-quality data provided by the former, which has enabled Pinnacle to establish itself as one of the go-to companies when it comes to sports betting markets for the esports segment.</p>
<p>Notably, Pinnacle has maintained a prominent status in Counter-Strike competitions, covering events by offering excellent market uptime, unique betting options, and full tournament coverage of virtually every major competition from the competitive video gaming world of the game.</p>
<p>Now, GRID and Pinnacle are talking about further expanding their mutual collaboration. The companies are hoping to soon begin offering betting products for Valorant, another fast-paced first-person shooter developed by Riot Games.</p>
<p>GRID and Pinnacle will continue to collaborate as the former helps Pinnacle B2B solutions thrive and leverage new markets and opportunities for esports betting fans. Commenting on this collaboration, Pinnacle CEO Paris Smith said:</p>
<p>For the last four years, the shared vision of advanced betting on esports between Pinnacle and GRID has been solidifying the foundation on which we have managed to build together a unique value proposition for the esports fans. Pinnacle CEO Paris Smith</p>
<p>Time to Take on Valorant and Expand Products</p>
<p>Smith hailed the opportunity to see GRID and Pinnacle continue to work together, noting that her company was in a position to continually innovate the esports betting experience as a result and create even more intuitive and trendsetting solutions for the sector. She also spoke highly of the Pinnacle Cup series, considered another important milestone by the company.</p>
<p>GRID chief sales officer Mikael Westerling was similarly pleased with the developments and hailed the opportunity to see GRID and Pinnacle enter yet another chapter of their collaboration. The expanded partnership will have a strong focus on improving and innovating the VALORANT offering, which can still catch up to the Counter-Strike portfolio.</p>
<p>Empowering Pinnacle to get there will be the next logical step in the companies’ alliance, Westerling explained.</p>
