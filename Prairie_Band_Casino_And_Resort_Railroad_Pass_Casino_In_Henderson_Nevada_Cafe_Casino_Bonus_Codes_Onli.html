    <h1>Prairie Band Casino And Resort Railroad Pass Casino In Henderson Nevada Cafe Casino Bonus Codes Onli</h1>

<p>The supplier and developer of innovative and cutting-edge iGaming content has now joined Markor Technology’s distribution platform</p>
<p>Galaxsys is a company that has focused heavily on the development of fast games and skill games, two specific verticals adapted for the needs of modern players.</p>
<p>These products will now be more accessible to players and third-party operators thanks to Markor Technology, which aggregates and provides businesses with a variety of noteworthy products.</p>
<p>Bringing Innovative Gaming Products to Markor’s Platform</p>
<p>Markor Technology focuses on PAM &amp; White Label solutions for operators, which allows brands to launch with a strong platform from the very start and have a pre-configured solution they can put to use right away.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership opportunity, Melissa Summerfield, Markor Technology’s CEO, hailed the opportunity and said that the company’s game aggregation platform is one of its biggest strengths. The chance to partner with strong up-and-coming studios that had a clear and defined vision for the iGaming industry was precisely what Markor Technology was all about. She further added:</p>
<p>Despite only being founded a year ago, Galaxsys is already a multi-award winning studio with an experienced management team that knows what it takes to provide quality content. Melissa Summerfield, Markor Technology’s CEO</p>
<p>The games provided by Galaxsys will further strengthen Markor’s growing portfolio of opportunities for the sector. Galaxsys is also planning to introduce no fewer than 30 launches ahead in 2023 which Summerfield said her company was very much looking to host on the aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Markor offers a powerful product with 6,000 products by tier-one suppliers. Markor is focused on constantly expanding the reach of its platform and uses in-house tools and technology to give partner operators an additional marketing and infrastructural boost when they seek to access top content and introduce it to players.</p>
<p>Partnerships Built on Shared Values Are Built to Last</p>
<p>Galaxsys head of sales Teni Grigoryan was similarly pleased with the opportunity. Grigoryan noted that partnerships built on shared values were the ones that would succeed in the long term. “We strongly believe in the big success of our cooperation with Markor Technology, which has already brought impressive results,” Grigoryan noted.</p>
<p>Markor Technology has been doing alright in recent weeks. The company signed Skywind, a supplier of both slot and live casino content, to its aggregation platform as a partner this week. Markor also managed to obtain an important market entry in Ontario, Canada with the company securing a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission in the province.</p>
