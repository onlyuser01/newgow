    <h1>Casino Bonuses Best Casino Atlantic City Casino Free Casino Castle Newest Casino In Las Vegas Kiron</h1>

<p>Global technology and software company specializing in the development of virtual sports and iGaming content Kiron Interactive announced it expanded its global footprint by securing a new license. The company confirmed Monday it secured a gambling supplier license in Greece, boosting significantly its global footprint.</p>
<p>Kiron secured the license from the gambling regulator in the country, the Hellenic Gaming Commission (HGC). Thanks to the license, the company can now deliver its instant games, as well as virtual sports products to operators within the regulated gambling market in the country.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this marks a milestone in the company's expansion as Greece is an important European market. The license from the HGC allows Kiron to engage with new partners which in turn will help its innovative and engaging content reach new audiences within the regulated market.</p>
<p>In a statement released on April 3, 2023, Kiron's Co-CEO, Steven Spartinos, shared his excitement saying: "We are incredibly pleased to have been granted a license to provide our games to a Greek audience, and this is also an important milestone for us as we continue to bring innovative and dynamic content to additional regulated markets."</p>
<p>He explained that the company is planning to sign multiple partnership deals and expand significantly in the region. Finally, Spartinos explained: "We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to working together with Greek operators to introduce our content to local players and grow our brand in this buoyant market."</p>
<p>It was recently when Greece implemented new regulations. Back in 2021, the country enforced new gambling legislation that allowed new operators to enter the country. This effectively enabled local casinos and sports betting operators to join forces with innovative and engaging studios and technology companies, enhancing their offerings.</p>
<p>The latest license comes on the heels of an important recognition secured by Kiron. Back in March, the company confirmed it was recognized by the Asia Gaming Awards. At the time, the company secured an award in the best Fantasy/Virtual Solution category, during a glamorous event taking place at the Manilla Marriott Hotel in the Philippines.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Spartinos said that Kiron Interactive is honored to secure this award. "This is a testament to our whole talented team which maintains its high standards year after year for our clients in Asia as well as globally," he explained. Finally, Spartinos congratulated the winners and acknowledged that this was another fantastic event for the gambling industry.</p>
