<p>iSoftBet, an iGaming operator, has entered into a partnership with the Czech national lottery, Sazka. As a result, iSoftBet will provide Sazka with the underpinning technology on which the lottery and now a new casino platform are based.</p>
<p>iSoftBet Partners with Sazka in the Czech Republic</p>
<p>Following its re-regulation in 2017, the Czech Republic’s gambling market is expanding once again. The most recent proof, a deal between the national lottery operator and an established iGaming company.</p>
<p>iSoftBet is teaming up with Sazka, the Czech Republic’s national lottery operator. Sazka has sought the services of iSoftBet in a bid to introduce a variety of high-quality and modern casino solutions.</p>
<p>iSoftBet will be joining Neogames, the current provider for Sazka, with the pair of companies elaborating a vast portfolio available to Czech plyers with an interest in gambling.</p>
<p>The content will appeal to players of all backgrounds and budgets, with specific solutions brought to the table, such as:</p>
<p>Slot games</p>
<p>Table games</p>
<p>Video poker</p>
<p>iSoftBet will also provide Sazka with a suite of tools that will allow the operator to monitor activities in real time, giving Sazka the opportunity to enforce better security measures as well as track aberrations in customer spending.</p>
<p>In light of the partnership, Sazka iGaming Director Jan Haryna commented: iSoftBet has an excellent reputation for generating significant revenues for brands via its leading content platform and for producing high-quality games that perform consistently well across regulated markets. We are very excited to be partnering with iSoftBet and look forward for a long and fruitful partnership.</p>
<p>iSoftBet Chief Commercial Officer Michael Probert also noted his satisfaction with the latest developments.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Probert the tie-up with Sazka represents an excellent opportunity to enhance his company’s footprint and offer.</p>
<p>He continued by saying that the excellence of iSoftBet’s games had been one of the key reasons why the company continues to expand into new markets with success.</p>
<p>iSoftBet has authored a variety of notable games in the past year or so, with titles including the Pearl of Orient and The Nutcracker gaining significant traction over their short span.</p>
<p>In anticipation of its 2019 expansion and scaling of operations, iSoftBet added Mark Claxton, a former IGT and Playtech slots expert as Head of Gaming in December, 2018.</p>
<p>The Czech gambling market continues to grow, albeit modestly. In June, 2018 the market posted its results for 2017, with total revenue hitting the impressive $1.8 billion, marking a 1.1%, which some saw as a feeble growth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Czech’s industry continues to gather steam, as exemplified by the string of most recent partnerships.</p>
