<p>Top LoL Picks for July 30 – August 5</p>
<p>There is a lot of League of Legends action across the League of Legends Pro League (LPL) and The League of Legends Development League (LDL), with some games clearly favoring one party by too much. However, we have been able to go through the majority of matches and find at least three excellent LoL betting opportunities.</p>
<p>LGD Gaming vs. Oh My God Pick</p>
<p>First, there is LGD Gaming (-166) playing Oh My God (+115) on Sunday. LGD Gaming is currently ranking 12th in the LPL after a series of bad beats and an underwhelming performance.</p>
<p>Conversely, Oh My God has been able to push to 8th position and has much fewer losses compared to the teams ahead of them. Posted at (-166) favorites, LGD Gaming is tipped to succeed in the weekend game.</p>
<p>Yet, we believe that Oh My God’s current standing in the LPL gives them a significant edge and you should probably pick OMG over LGD Gaming for this one.</p>
<p>Pick Oh My God to Win (+115)</p>
<p>Royal Never Give Up vs. Team We Pick</p>
<p>There seems to be yet another great value betting opportunity. Royal Never Given Up currently ranks 10th in the overall standing in the LPL and is nevertheless posted as favorites at (-217).</p>
<p>This comes to Team We’s listing as underdogs at (+148). While the oddsmakers at MyBookie.ag seem to think that RNG has the upper hand here, our gut tells us that Team We will continue to carry on their momentum.</p>
<p>They are riding a four-game win streak and, with the games against Rogue Warriors and Invictus still pending, there is a good chance that Team We could be coming with a six-game winning streak for the game on August 3.</p>
<p>The only thing we feel you ought to be aware of is that Team We will be playing many more games than their opponents, leading to a drop in their performance.</p>
<p>Pick Team We to win (+148)</p>
<p>Edward Gaming vs LNG Esports Pick</p>
<p>The game between Edward Gaming and LNG pits two distinct LPL teams against each other. Edward is currently standing in the LPL group standing with LNG being third. The odds put Edward Gaming as a strong favorite at (-303) against LNG’s (+194).</p>
<p>However, Edward did lose two consecutive games and is set up to play versus Victory Five on Friday. Meanwhile, LNG has had some issues to address with its roster, but this seems to be in the past now.</p>
<p>Pick LNG Esports to win (+194)</p>
