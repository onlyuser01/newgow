<p>Panda's Fortune 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot has an East Asian animal theme.</p>
<p>Players will begin by journeying into the Chinese countryside. There, they will find mysterious relics, and most stunning of all, majestic panda bears.</p>
<p>This game provides a fantasy of Eastern culture with a spiritual flair.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A calming string tune plays in the background, accompanied by peaceful bird sounds. This soundtrack will make players feel like they’ve arrived at a high-end spa. Those who would prefer to play without the relaxing music will easily be able to click mute.</p>
<p>Upon spins, the music becomes more dramatic, ensuring that some tension is added.</p>
<p>The quality of the animation is fair, though the style of the symbols varies as if they were completed by different artists.</p>
<p>Most of the wildlife symbols are drawn as if they are carved statues or ornaments. This adds exotic flair and makes them seem especially decorative. The exception is the panda, which is drawn realistically.</p>
<p>The panda symbol looks out directly at the players while chewing a mouthful of bamboo. When part of winning combinations, the panda animates and turns its head adorably. It’s easy to become attached to this gentle-looking bear and imagine it as a playful pet.</p>
<p>The other animal symbols include stylised butterflies, lions, and fish. The lower-paying symbols are made up of letters and numbers embellished with colourful designs.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see an idyllic landscape of rolling hills, blue sky, and temples. The reels themselves are housed under an ornate roof with lanterns hung on each side.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Panda's Fortune 2 is a five reel, three row slot, with 25 win lines.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol. The Wild symbol will only appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>Each symbol besides the Bonus symbol has a special golden equivalent. The golden version of a symbol may appear on any reel.</p>
<p>The Golden symbols have the same base value as their non-gold equivalents, but can increase winnings through multipliers that they add.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land 3 or more Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels. Players will begin the feature with 12 free spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, every position Golden symbols land will be marked golden until the end of the feature. From that point on, only Golden symbols will land in those positions.</p>
<p>If players land 3 or more Bonus symbols during the Free Spins feature, they will be awarded 8 more free spins.</p>
<p>Throughout the Free Spins feature, special reels will be in play for the duration.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.51%, well above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€ up to a maximum of $/£/€ per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility East Asian animal-themed slot.</p>
<p>The adorable panda host of this game would be a draw in itself, but the robust RTP and high volatility also make this game great from a strategy perspective.</p>
<p>Players looking to maximise their wins will be pleased by this game’s profile, as well as the cute animal friends.</p>
<p>The fantasy journey into Asia is upheld well by this game’s graphics and animation as well.</p>
