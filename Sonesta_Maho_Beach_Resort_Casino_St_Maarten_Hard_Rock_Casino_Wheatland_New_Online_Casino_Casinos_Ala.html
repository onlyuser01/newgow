<p>This strategic purchase expands PLN's portfolio, known for turning niche sports into betting sensations, and positions them to capitalize on the surging popularity of this unconventional sport</p>
<p>Pro League Network (PLN), a sports entertainment company, has ventured into the world of slap-fighting by acquiring the renowned SlapFight Championship.</p>
<p>JT Tilley Takes the Helm as Creative Director at PLN</p>
<p>The acquisition brings not only the SlapFight Championship assets but also the expertise of its Founder and CEO, JT Tilley, who will now take on the role of creative director within PLN. Tilley, whose background spans sports, entertainment, comedy, and music, is tasked with shaping the creative direction of PLN’s entire sports portfolio, emphasizing entertainment value alongside betting opportunities.</p>
<p>SlapFight, established in 2017 by Tilley, has transformed slap-fighting into a legitimate sport with strict rules and a growing fan base. Notable fighters, including former UFC Heavyweight Champion Tim Sylvia and home-grown talents like Wolverine, The Bell, and Neanderthal, have graced its roster. The championship’s live pay-per-view and tape-delayed events have drawn millions of social media impressions, especially on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.</p>
<p>Since PLN secured wagering rights for SlapFIGHT in 2022, the sport has gained recognition in six US jurisdictions, making it available for betting enthusiasts through DraftKings. With this acquisition, PLN takes full control of SlapFight Championship, encompassing branding, content libraries, and social media channels.</p>
<p>In October 2022, slap-fighting officially became regulated in Nevada after approval by the Nevada Athletic Commission.</p>
<p>PLN Unveils Ambitious Plans for SlapFight</p>
<p>PLN’s co-founders, Mike Salvaris and Bill Yucatonis, expressed their enthusiasm, saying: “We couldn’t be more excited to add SlapFight to our portfolio and are looking forward to growing the brand, as well as introducing SlapFight fans to other PLN sports.”</p>
<p>They also highlighted Tilley’s talent for developing sports that are not only easy to comprehend but also captivating to watch and likely to go viral. This collaboration aims to bring even more unique sports experiences to the audience.</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of the deal, PLN plans to establish a state-of-the-art studio in Branson, Missouri, where Tilley will oversee the creation of a new entertainment series, including “BFC Extreme.” This series will showcase a regular roster of athletes competing in emerging PLN sports, promising an immersive sports and entertainment experience. Tilley shared his vision, stating:</p>
<p>When I first met the PLN team last year it was clear that we shared a vision for the future of sports entertainment – one where sports that may be considered ‘niche’ could, if produced correctly, be appealing to a broad audience and engaged with across multiple channels – including betting, fantasy and watch-alongs. PLN creative director JT Tilley</p>
<p>PLN, founded in 2022, has gained recognition for promoting alternative sports and creating wagering opportunities, filling under-optimized slots on the sports calendar. It boasts a portfolio of over 16 brands, including the World Putting League, CarJitsu Championship, XTreme Long Drive, Pro Footgolf, National Carrom League, Strongman, T3 TouchTennis, and Beastball.</p>
