<p>XB Net, a leading provider of premium content from the world of horse racing in North America, has been able to secure a new top-tier partnership that will result in the delivery of more actionable data from the New York Venue of Yonkers Raceway.</p>
<p>Thanks to this new partnership revealed via email and on the company’s LinkedIn page, XB Net will be able to distribute the data not just within the United States, but also with any international partner that is interested in bringing more North American horse racing action to their audiences and fans.</p>
<p>Yonkers Raceway was not picked by chance either. The venue is a leading horse racing meeting space, and it hosts three of the most important harness racing events every year. Those are the Messenger Stakes, the Art Rooney Pace, and not least – the Yonkers Trot. The tournaments often run sizeable prize pools, with the International Trot over the past weekend featuring a $1m prize purse.</p>
<p>Тhis partnership opportunity was naturally welcomed by XB Net Senior Vice President International Simon Fraser who said that his company and he were delighted to be able to share data from the Yonkers Raceway, a venue with a strong track record in the horse racing way.</p>
<p>That was what Fraser described as a "progressive partnership" and one that is well worth remembering. He also spoke about the importance of delivering data to international operators from the best venues and races in the most reliable way possible:</p>
<p>"For many global operators, this can represent a significant step towards being able to develop and educate around the popular sport of Harness Racing. It has a loyal and active following, and provides an exciting area into which some can broaden and diversify their content timetables."</p>
<p>XB Net has been able to secure a respectable standing in the North American horse racing market. The company has been involved with various partnerships that span the full range of experiences, from racing content to managing international rights, live broadcast, video streaming and so much more. In fact, XB Net is providing low-latency feeds from more than 2,500 meetings and over 25,000 races every year.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hard work put in by XB Net, fans from around the world stay focused and up-to-date, while horse racing continues on an international scale. XB Net presently provides data and works with a number of established companies from all across the world. Some of the biggest partners of XB Net to date include Flutter, William Hill, Entain, bet365, and others.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, XB Net announced a partnership with Betindiaraces. The company continues to build its international footprint.</p>
