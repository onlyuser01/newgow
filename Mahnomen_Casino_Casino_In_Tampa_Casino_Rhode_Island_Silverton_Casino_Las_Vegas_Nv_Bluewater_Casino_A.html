<p>Travel to the Far East Next to the Wooden Kokeshi Japanese Dolls</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive officer Nicola Longmuir spoke about KokeshiPop, inviting players to join the beautiful Kokeshi Japanese dolls on their journey to the Far East. Longmuir described the game as being “packed” with large multipliers and a maximum win capped at 10,000x. The CEO called the new slot ”another stellar addition” to their constantly-growing catalog of slots.</p>
<p>The game has a cool design with beautiful and subtle elements that belong to Japanese culture with a special emphasis on origami. The slot features an expandable grid surrounded by a pagoda-like structure in a rural location. All symbol animations and winning ways light up nicely as soon as the reels stop spinning. To create a winning way, players must land matching symbols on a minimum of three adjacent reels starting on either of the sides. The game features 12 regular paying symbols, with low-paying symbols like 10-A cards ranks, amulets, cats, and swords for medium-paying symbols, and colorful characters in the form of high and the super-high-paying symbols. The wild symbol is represented by a waving cat, which is a substitute for all regular paying symbols. The wild symbols can only pop during free spin rounds.</p>
<p>Free Spins and the Kokeshi Multiplier</p>
<p>When players land at least three scatters, the Free Spins mode is activated. Here, players receive a minimum of five free spins with the reels starting at four symbols high with a potential to expand and reach up to 33,614 paylines. When all the reels are unlocked during Free Spins mode, players are given the Kokeshi Multiplier which boosts the value of the current multiplier by up to 20x.</p>
<p>Prior to entering the feature, players can also use the Gamble Wheel to win as many as 12 free spins. In some jurisdictions, the game comes with the Buy Bonus or Buy Max Bonus options. KokeshiPop will first be exclusively available for AvatarUX’s partners. It will reach the global market next year.</p>
<p>At the beginning of October, AvatarUX inked an aggregation deal with Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
