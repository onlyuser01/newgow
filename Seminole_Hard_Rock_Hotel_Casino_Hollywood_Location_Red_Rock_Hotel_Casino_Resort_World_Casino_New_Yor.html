<p>In February, Aruze filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the State of Nevada. Last week, the company announced it’s shuttering its Las Vegas office and laying off 100 workers as part of that process.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the Play Synergy purchase weren’t disclosed. Pending court and regulatory approvals, Play Synergy said the transaction could be finalized within the next 30 days. Aruze is the maker of the Rock Paper Scissors Instant Win slot machines, among other electronic gaming machines.</p>
<p>The company’s lone shareholder is Japanese businessman Kazuo Okada, and its U.S. clients include brick-and-mortar and internet casino operators.</p>
<p>With the acquisition, Play Synergy is assuming “responsibility for, the related sales, service, support, and operations of Aruze’s slot route and operations.”</p>
<p>Play Synergy May Save Some Aruze Las Vegas Jobs</p>
<p>As noted above, Aruze announced last week that it plans to eliminate 100 jobs at its Las Vegas headquarters. But it’s possible some of those roles may be saved.</p>
<p>Aruze, Play Synergy, and all other stakeholders in the process have worked exceptionally well together to provide the vast majority of Aruze team members with new employment opportunities,” said Play Synergy President Frank Feng in the statement. “This, along with interest from others in the industry, has had the result of minimizing the disruption to those impacted and their families.”</p>
<p>Play Synergy didn’t mention how many of those 100 jobs, if any, could be saved. The buyer of the Aruze U.S .slot operations also highlighted a commitment to the seller’s customers, noting it expects a smooth transition.</p>
<p>“Play Synergy understands that this process can be unsettling to Aruze’s current customer base, and wants to reassure each of them that our team, including those that will be joining us from Aruze, are committed to a smooth transition, along with a focus on excellence in customer service,” according to the statement.</p>
<p>Play Synergy Story</p>
<p>Play Synergy has three primary divisions; slot machines, table games, and technology. The company’s gaming machines include the Lucky and Penny series of slots, as well as electronic keno and poker offerings. Its table games include variations of baccarat, blackjack, and poker.</p>
<p>“We started in the table game business and have developed a collection of market-proven winners, including our flagship table game, Golden Frog Baccarat,” according to the company.</p>
<p>Play Synergy’s SMRT Choice table game technology provides casino operators with live player analytics. It can be customized across various iterations of baccarat, blackjack, and poker.</p>
