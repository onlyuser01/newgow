<p>Information about Rival casinos</p>
<p>Rival are a global provider of desktop and mobile casino games, including their innovative i-Slots, and they also offer a full turnkey solution for operators. Read on to find out more about them and how you can find the best Rival Gaming casino for you to play on.</p>

<p>Rival Gaming: combining innovative i-Slots with turnkey solutions since 2006</p>
<p>If you want a platform to announce your presence, then GiGse is a great place to start. The international event provided the setting for Rival Gaming to hit the gaming scene with a bang in 2006, and the company has since made a big name for itself in the casino industry.</p>
<p>Its first few years saw Rival build its reputation as a supplier of solid slots titles such as Cream of the Crop and Hole in Won.</p>
<p>Where Rival Gaming really stood out, though, was through the introduction of its popular i-Slots titles: story-based games that entertain the user with soap opera-style plotlines as they play.</p>
<p>Always looking to expand its range, the company introduced its Mini-Games selection in 2012 — games focused on quick and simple play — as well as video slots Smoking Gun and Diamond Dragon, not to mention a string of other titles to keep casino players happy.</p>
<p>Rival also operates in other areas within the online casino industry. Its Casino Controller is a platform that allows operators to set up their own casino system and is part of a full turnkey solution that allows Rival to cater for a large section of the iGaming market.</p>
<p>Rival Gaming slots and software</p>
<p>Rival Gaming's two main services to the iGaming industry come in the form of highly engaging slots and software expertise in the form of their Casino Controller software solution. Here we can take a look at these two areas in a little more depth.</p>
<p>Rival slots</p>
<p>Let's look a little further into Rival Gaming's video slots, also referred to as i-Slots, the engaging plot-based games that the company offers.</p>
<p>One of these is Smoking Gun, a fun Wild West-themed adventure with nice graphics and even nicer features. The jackpot is 2,000x the stake on the line, which could result in a gigantic payout, and great free spins rounds offer a brilliant diversion.</p>
<p>Japan-O-Rama uses classic 80s-style arcade music to take players on a tour of classic Japan, with its sushi, sumo wrestler and Godzilla symbols. You can activate bonus features when you get three or more of the Geisha or Sumo symbols anywhere on the five reels, during which you go to a new 'Pachinko' game screen to win special prizes.</p>
<p>Games like Winsanity and Hot Hand also show Rival's ability to create classic-looking games. While the graphics suffer a little, the gameplay is enhanced by impressive multipliers giving you the chance to win a lot of money. These two titles certainly cater for fans of simpler slots games.</p>
<p>It's always a good idea to try out games for free before depositing funds, so be sure to check them out on our list of free Rival games and slots in our database of free casino games.</p>
<p>Rival software</p>
<p>Rival Gaming's expertise in the software field means that their games are powered efficiently and run well in both mobile and desktop formats. The quality of graphics depends on which game you're playing, but the latest titles show off some sleek touches and engaging special effects.</p>
<p>An important thing for gamers today is an ability to run on mobile devices, and Rival uses HTML5 technology to run their titles smoothly for mobile casino players.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning Rival's software solution: Casino Controller. Available to merchants for immediate use upon purchase, it is a powerful, easy-to-use platform that allows operators to run an online casino efficiently. It comes with a range of features: these include a user-friendly yet highly developed interface, a useful data-mining tool, and inbuilt advertising and marketing plans. Customers can also get training as to how to use it more effectively, as well as fraud detection software.</p>
