<p>Westgate LV SuperBook Posts Odds for Vegas Golden Knights Games</p>

<p>The NHL’s newest team, the Vegas Golden Knights, aren’t expected to do much in their inaugural season, but the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook really doubts their chances in the team’s first game of the season.</p>

<p>The oddsmakers made the city’s first professional sports team a huge underdog when they go on the road against the Dallas Stars, Oct. 6.</p>
<p>Vegas is a plus-220 pick against the team from Texas, while the Stars are minus-250 on the money line. The team won just 34 games last season and was one of six squads in the Western Conference to not make the playoffs. Winnipeg, Los Angeles, Arizona, Vancouver and Colorado were the others.</p>
<p>The lines were announced before the expansion draft and Westgate officials said the line could move before the start of the season. They also had picks for over and under, which is 5.5 and a minus-110 for either team. The spread for the game was 1.5 goals for the Golden Knights at minus-135.</p>
<p>Home Sweet Home</p>
<p>The odds for the group are a little better when they make their debut at T-Mobile Arena on Oct. 10. It will be the Golden Knights third game, they play Arizona three nights before in Phoenix. They then host the Coyotes in their newly built arena.</p>
<p>The matchup could provide fans with a satisfying evening. The home team has the same figure as the visitor with a minus-105 straight up, but is a heavy favorite, with a 1.5 goal differential and a minus-330.</p>
<p>The more interesting wagers may be the proposition bets, which range from enticing to exotic. The traditional bet of whether the team will win the Stanley Cup is available.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the team is last at 200-1. One of the more unconventional offers is what will the temperature be at McCarran Airport when the puck is dropped at the home opener, Oct. 10.</p>
<p>The over and under is set at 74.5 degrees, with, much to the dismay of local residents, the over favored at plus-150.</p>
<p>Team Takes Shape</p>
<p>Wednesday was the expansion draft, where the organization got to pick one member that was unprotected by the other 30 squads in the league.</p>
<p>The Golden Knights selected several quality athletes, including Stanley Cup goalie, Marc-Andre Fleury, Nashville forward, James Neal, and Ottawa defenseman, Marc Methot.</p>
<p>General Manager George McPhee focused on youth as more than half his selections were under the age of 25 and the first year executive, who came from the Washington Capitals, believes the team will be immediately competitive.</p>
<p>“We’re certainly delighted with the way it went,” McPhee said.</p>
<p>Bettors might be as well. The line on how many games the team will win in its first season was set before the draft at 24.5. Many believe with a weaker Western Conference that the Golden Knights have a chance to easily surpass that mark.</p>
