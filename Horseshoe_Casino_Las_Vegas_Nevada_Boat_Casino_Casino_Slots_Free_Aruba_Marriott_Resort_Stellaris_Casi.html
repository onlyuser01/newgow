<p>Virtue Poker Asks Player to Beat Phil Ivey for $7,000 Reward</p>
<p>Decentralized peer-to-peer poker platform Virtue Poker is launching the Ivey’s Table promotion today, Wednesday, April 15, offering poker players a chance to play against Phil Ivey, the legend himself, in a $12,500 tournament with a shot at $7,000 for finishing first on June 7 when the main event will take place.</p>
<p>Giving away seats in a private game against me @Virtue_Poker. Costs $0 to play and you could be heads up with me for $7k at https://t.co/fpnPqFo7ld. RT and download for entry. Stay safe out there. More info: https://t.co/cG4KNEjnSU pic.twitter.com/M4w3B2j6g5 — Phil Ivey (@philivey) April 15, 2020</p>
<p>Players will face Ivey in Short Deck Texas Hold’em, which the platform has described as the player’s “new favorite game.”</p>
<p>With qualifications as simple as you playing at the site, every player has a chance to win at least $5,000 for first place and then, if they have eliminated Ivey from the table, an additional $1,000 bounty placed on the poker pro’s head will be added to the final payout.</p>
<p>To play at Virtue Poker, all you need to do is go to the official website and hit the download button. The poker suite works with Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Once you are set up, what you need to do is join The Short Deck Leaderboard and make sure you finish first or second.</p>
<p>Even if you finish first or second, though, you would still need to have completed at least 200 Sit &amp; Go tournaments, so keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Win the Random Drops for a Seat at the Final</p>
<p>There are also random drops for three extra seats. These “random” conditions that will qualify you for the event, include playing your first Sit &amp; Go at the platform or, you can also get an entry if you have participated in over 100 Sit &amp; Go tournaments, or even retweeted the official announcement on the social media.</p>
<p>All players will get a chance to win one of the following prizes, depending on their final placement in the tournament:</p>
<p>1st: $5,000 + $2,000</p>
<p>2nd: $3,500</p>
<p>3rd: $2,500</p>
<p>4th: $1,000</p>
<p>5th: $500</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you bust Ivey and win the tournament, on top of the $1,000 for beating the pro, you will also get an extra $1,000. This way, the total prize for first place could become $7,000.</p>
<p>You have time to qualify through May 24, giving you plenty of time to make the Ivey’s Table challenge and show your poker skills.</p>
<p>The player who eliminates Phil will also receive a personal tweet of endorsement, putting their name on the poker radar very quickly. Outside the Ivey’s Table,Virtue Poker offers a selection of other promotions, including a $10,000 Main Event package for the World Series of Poker (WSOP).</p>
<p>Every newly registered user begins with 50,000 Virtue Poker Points (VPPs) giving you plenty of currency to join the Sit &amp; Go tournaments or explore any of the other promotions. The platform accepts Ethereum (ETH) as well.</p>
