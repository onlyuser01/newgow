<p>Egyptian-Themed Slot With Free Spins</p>
<p>The fresh release brings the popular Egyptian-themed in the spotlight, a “mainstay within iGaming for many years”, as Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy called it. The fact that this theme is so popular and appreciated by players is one of the main reasons why it was chosen for the new slot. The game is expected to turn into one of the hottest games of the summer. McCarthy expressed the studio’s thrill and excitement to “add another top-class book-style game” to their “ever-growing YG Masters Portfolio” with the help of AceRun.</p>
<p>Yggdrasill used McCarthy’s voice to explain its eagerness to work “closely” with AceRun in the future, giving birth to “fantastic gaming experiences”. Book HOTFIRE brings homage to other classic sacred book collecting titles players of the genre are used to. The main purpose of the game is to collect as many sacred books as possible under the watch of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh, in order to engage in a lucrative bonus round that could trigger a massive win of up to 6,440x the stake.</p>
<p>Free Spins and Wheel of Fortune</p>
<p>When a minimum of three book symbols are seen landing on any position on the reels, players receive 10 free spins. Prior to the bonus round being initiated, players must spin a wheel of fortune. The landing symbol on the wheel will turn into a special symbol during the free spins round. During the bonus round, the special symbol will automatically expand and cover all three positions on the reel provided enough symbols can activate a win.</p>
<p>When at least three book symbols are seen popping up anywhere on the reels while the free spins feature is still in play, the bonus feature is retriggered for an endless number of free spins and greater prizes.</p>
<p>AceRun’s head of development Jeroen van der Heijden referred to past slots released via the YG Masters program as “incredibly impressive”. He also expressed the studio’s pride to have released the modern and sleek game together with Yggdrasil, hoping the game would deliver the type of timeless gameplay that players are known to appreciate. At the beginning of August, Yggdrasil announced the release of Monsters VS Gigablox, Hot Rise Games’ latest title together. At the end of July, the developer launched MexoMax! MultiMax, is a new MultiMax series mage with an Aztec theme.</p>
