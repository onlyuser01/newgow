    <h1>Aquarius Casino Laughlin Nevada Casino In St Ignace Pa Hollywood Casino Hollywood Lawrenceburg Casin</h1>

<p>That's actually an interesting idea that never came to my mind, but I guess there would be some issues with it:</p>
<p>1) I know that Casino Guru founders never wanted to run their own casino, because we want to be objective as much as possible and we don't want to encourage people to play in casinos. I'd say that creating an own slot would be a way of encouraging people to play in casinos.</p>
<p>2) We have sometimes good relations with certain people from different casinos, but we don't have too many friends among game providers. I don't think that anyone would create this for free and I'm not sure if we would be willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>3) This is actually the most important point - since every slot needs to have some RTP and volatility, we could start getting complaints from players who lost money or many spins in a row on our slot. They would be just unlucky, but it would be very difficult to convince them that we're a website focusing on honest casino reviews while they would be losing money on our slot. Generally speaking, most of people would be losing and when people lose money, you don't want to expose your brand to them.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm going to ask others what they think about it ðŸ™‚</p>
