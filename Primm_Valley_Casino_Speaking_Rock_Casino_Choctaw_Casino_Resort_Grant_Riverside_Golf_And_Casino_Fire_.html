    <h1>Primm Valley Casino Speaking Rock Casino Choctaw Casino Resort Grant Riverside Golf And Casino Fire</h1>

<p>Dear 7anoosh,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"BLOCKING</p>
<p>You an opportunity to take a break or self exclud yourself from gambling if you feel that gambling is becoming a problem.</p>
<p>You can take a break for a definite or indefinite period of time; however, if you do not feel you can stop playing online casino of your own volition, you have the option to suspend your account by entering a date of your choice.</p>
<p>If it is a definite period of time for the closure the account will automatically be reopened after the chosen period. If you feel that the chosen period of time is not suited for you anymore, closed for indefinite or if you want closed your account without any option to reopen please contact our Customer Support team and we will assist you with future information.</p>
<p>This can be done by yourself from the website or you can contact your Customer Support team that will help you.</p>
<p>If you consider self-exclusion, please contact all the gambling providers with whom you have active accounts, and ask them to block you. Also, we recommend that you consider installing software that will allow you to block access to gambling sites over the Internet. Details can be found at the bottom of this page."</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings SlotV Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@slotv.com (you can CC me petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
