<p>Betsson has secured Nicole Regnier, a former professional soccer player, as its newest ambassador in Colombia. Regnier used to play for Atletico Madrid in Europe and is a known name in women’s soccer. She is also a popular commentator of sports derbies back home, which is going to help the company use her profile to raise awareness for its own operations in the country.</p>
<p>The Right Pick to Expand in Colombia</p>
<p>However, Betsson is also keen to make it so that it helps sports in Colombia as well. Commenting on this opportunity, Betsson Colombia country manager Santiago Melo said that the company was excited to be working with Regnier who is an important soccer legend in Colombia as one of the first female soccer players to have brought fame to her country by performing well in international competitions. Melo added:</p>
<p>I am certain that together with Nicole and our regional ambassador, Mario Alberto Yepes, we will advance in our purpose of being a company recognized for its sports experience and an exciting portfolio of services.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by Regnier as well who said that she was both happy and full of expectations about the future and what Betsson and her were going to achieve. She also added that the company and herself had a lot in common, including their passion for soccer, but also a shared commitment to involving more women in female soccer.</p>
<p>Betsson has been steadily growing its international footprint, which has translated into strong results during the third quarter. The company reported Q3 revenue of €200.3 million or roughly $200.7 million at the time of writing. Regnier will be an important part of Betsson’s strategy to expand in Latin America. She also played in Rayo Vallecano before retiring and becoming a sports commentator for networks such as ESPN.</p>
