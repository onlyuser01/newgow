    <h1>Diamond Jo Casino Worth Fortune Coins Sweeps Casino Silver Reef Casino Resort Casino And Resort Near</h1>

<p>Hello, I made a profit with a bonus. It is clear to me that the amount of the bonus will not be paid out. However, the binus was already deducted from the 1400 euros. However, my entire game history was deleted by the casino, as I have violated the guidelines according to the terms and conditions (Martingale at Roulette)</p>
<p>I don't even know if the amounts cleared by the casino were justified or not. In other words: You could have deleted other winnings and I can NOT do anything about it.</p>
<p>At the moment I am in the process of clarifying to get at least something over 200 euros paid out. This is the amount that was left of the 1400 euros after the casino deducted my "Martingale winnings". It said the payout was approved and I've been waiting for a week now. Upon request, it was said that it would take 3-5 working days, so the money should come today.</p>
