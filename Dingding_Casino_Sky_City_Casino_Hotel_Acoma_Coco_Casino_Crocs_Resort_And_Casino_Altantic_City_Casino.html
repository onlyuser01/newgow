    <h1>Dingding Casino Sky City Casino Hotel Acoma Coco Casino Crocs Resort And Casino Altantic City Casino</h1>

<p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>On the contrary, I think that controversy dominates the contemporary world and I might even call it a "fashion trend"</p>
<p>I'm a father of twins who love Marvel movies. The full repertoire of these movies has been playing in our house almost daily for the past 5 years, so I know the dubbing of the movies almost from memory. Even though the Marvel movies are aimed at children ages 8 - X and are presented as family movies, there are catchphrases and expressions that "Weather girl" in our Crazy Weather game "isn't good enough" for. And we are comparing a "family movie" to a casino game, where only registered persons over the age of 18 are allowed to enter the casino. Does my reasoning need further comment? If so, we still have the "endless animated series" South Park Town. Sure, it's aimed at older "kids" J but it's still a cartoon series - thus kid-friendly and I think the popularity of this series is huge despite being more than controversial. Plus, the dub of South Park can be tolerated on public television where access is not blocked to under 18s ... And now I've only given two Hollywood examples and I could go on for hours - as a film buff, I know dozens and dozens of similar examples :-)</p>
<p>I contend that we live in a controversial world and we live controversial lives. So I don't think the comments of the animated announcer in Crazy Weather offends anyone, and if it does, they don't need to play the game. The purpose of the character's commentary is not to offend anyone but to entertain - just like MARVEL and many others who reach for similar controversy in their work. Do you think we did anything wrong ? no, definitely not - we just did it differently and I think the character comments "speak to 99% of the players soul"</p>
<p>Well, I can reassure you - there are two of us, I also knew the providers, the names of the games and their principle. But it's not that there are more providers - we're just getting older and remember less :ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>But seriously. Yes there are many providers. It's just that in 2015, which you recall, there were about a third of the casinos compared to 2021. Just as casinos are increasing, providers are also increasing. The market is simply growing and now during the "covid era" this market is growing even faster. And just as there are good and bad casinos, there are good and bad providers. Many small ones will fall through the net of the gaming market, many without ambition, many without the necessary effort and "drive" We at Casimi will do and are doing everything we can to stay in this net for a long time. We are serious about iGaming!</p>
<p>Basically, even the game Crazy Weather, is a partial answer to your question/thought with the "oversaturated market" - it is necessary to differentiate ourselves, it is necessary to make games differently. Everyone today is doing 81 ways games, 27 ways games, games with scatters and 10,15,25 bonus games etc etc etc and everything is the same. Nobody wants to stand out from the crowd - everybody just follows the beaten path. We at Casimi have one foot on the "known path but the other" we go "out of line" and maybe run the risk of stepping in something every now and then" Sometimes it smells and it's a good game and sometimes it doesn't and it's a crap</p>
