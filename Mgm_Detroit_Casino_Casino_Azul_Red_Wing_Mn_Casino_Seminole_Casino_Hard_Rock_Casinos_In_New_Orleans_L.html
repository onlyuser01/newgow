    <h1>Mgm Detroit Casino Casino Azul Red Wing Mn Casino Seminole Casino Hard Rock Casinos In New Orleans L</h1>

<p>I signed up to the casino to put on some bets during the World Cup at the end of last year.</p>
<p>I made a deposit of 100 EUR but had not yet placed any bets when they contacted me asking to provide verification documents.</p>
<p>I had not requested a withdrawal, had not placed a bet. I am verified at multiple gambling institutions and have always done so by uploading my documents to the website directly using a secure form.</p>
<p>Izibet on the other hand wanted me to send the documents via an unsecured email. Indeed they would not send my personal data to me without protecting it yet expect me to send it to them in this insecure manner.</p>
<p>I refused and requested that they provide a secure upload of which I would be happy to send the mentioned documents to verify one self.</p>
<p>Furher to this, I submitted a GDPR request to them last year, it was ignored and never settled despite the law. I sent a reminder to them about this which again was completely ignored by the company of which I have today submitted a complaint to the ICO in Malta.</p>
<p>Beyond this, I also previously submitted a request to the ADR they provide (also based in Malta) and again no response was received from this process either. As such as well as the complaint made to the ICO for the breach in law, I am ready to submit a complaint to the MGA.</p>
<p>I ask that you team here can find a way to mediate and settle this issue. At the end of the day I no longer have any interest to bet or play with such a company and just want the 100 EUR that they have effectively stolen from me returned.</p>
<p>It's a small amount that I have not missed much over the past 10-11 months but there is a principle behind it.</p>
