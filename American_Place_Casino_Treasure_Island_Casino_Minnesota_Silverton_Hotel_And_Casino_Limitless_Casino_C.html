<p>The portfolio of international sports betting partnerships of the National Hockey League (NHL) continues to expand after an announcement today revealed the professional league teamed with Austria-based Interwetten.</p>
<p>Increase Brand Awareness</p>
<p>The partnership between the NHL and Interwetten made the online sports betting firm an official partner in Austria and Germany of the North American hockey league. The agreement will allow the bookmaker to increase its brand awareness across its core markets by offering individualized entertainment experiences for sports fans and secure betting products for sports bettors.</p>
<p>Excited to welcome Interwetten as an official partner of the NHL, the league’s vice president of International Business Development and Partnerships John Lewicki commented:</p>
<p>“Interwetten is a leader in the sports betting category, delivering great entertainment to their customers through creative marketing initiatives. We look forward to working with Interwetten to engage the ever-growing hockey fanbase across Austria and Germany.” John Lewicki, VP, Business Development and Partnerships, International, NHL</p>
<p>The partnership will provide Interwetten with official NHL branding for its sports betting offering in Austria and Germany, premier marketing positions on the league’s digital assets, including NHL.com/de and NHL.com’s official German version, as well as rights to use official NHL marks, logos and designations for its dynamic marketing campaigns and authentic fan experiences.</p>
<p>“As a reliable sports betting provider, we focus our engagements and collaborations in sports with long-term partnerships that enable maximum entertainment. We are proud that we have a multiyear partnership with the NHL – the best ice hockey league in the world – and the SIG Group.” Stefan Sulzbacher, Spokesman for the Board of Directors, Interwetten</p>
<p>The agreement will also provide Interwetten with access to a full portfolio of media assets controlled by the NHL among which custom digital, social and email marketing campaigns that help the league’s partners to build brand awareness and drive new customer acquisition.</p>
<p>Sportradar Supports NHL’s International Partnerships</p>
<p>The partnership with Interwetten is supported by the Official Betting Data Rights Partner of the NHL, Sportradar, which is providing the league with data-driven marketing solutions and digital marketing campaigns through its ad:s platform to help the NHL develop sports betting partnerships outside of North America.</p>
<p>The partnership between the NHL and Interwetten is similar to the deal signed between the professional hockey league and Liga Stavok to make the Russian-based sports betting brand the Official Sports Betting Partner of the NHL and Official Sportsbook of the NHL in Russia and the CIS region. That agreement was also reached with the support of Sportradar, which is an established partner of the Russian betting operator.</p>
<p>For Interwetten, the arrangement with the NHL marked the latest agreement with a sports organization following recent strategic sponsorship deals with the German Ski Association (DSV) and the Austrian Ski Association (ÖSV).</p>
