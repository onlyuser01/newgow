<p>The Texans are preparing for a new season in the NFL, and they have chosen Caesars Entertainment to boost awareness for their brand through digital channels and more.</p>
<p>Houston Texans Tap Caesars as Official Casino Partner</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment has teamed up with the Houston Texans becoming the official casino partner for the team. The partnership went live yesterday, ahead of the 2021 NFL regular season.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Texans President Greg Grissom has praised Caesars Entertainment as a brand that aligns perfectly with the sports franchise’s own commitment to creating memorable experiences for fans.</p>
<p>“We have some great events lined up for this upcoming season that fans will not want to miss, and this partnership with Caesars is just another example of how we continue to look for ways to enhance the experience,” Grissom added.</p>
<p>Caesars Rewards will be an official sponsor of the “Schedule Pick ‘Em” game that runs on the official Texans mobile app. Fans will have a chance to set a matchup prediction and benefit from various rewards, including game tickets, a trip to a Caesars casino or sportsbook, and more.</p>
<p>Many Rewards to Be Plucked from “Schedule Pick ‘Em”</p>
<p>There will also be an all-inclusive trip to Las Vegas for each game, which should boost engagement with fans and reflect positively on both brands. Caesars Rewards members will have access to a luxurious suite at NRG Stadium, the Texans’ home field, from where they can watch the game. Both organizations will push their intellectual property and recognizable signage through each other’s digital platforms.</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed by Caesars Digital co-president Chris Holdren, who asserted, “Caesars Entertainment is committed to expanding relationships with leagues and professional sports teams, and we’re thrilled to team up with the Houston Texans.”</p>
<p>He added that the company is looking forward to providing fans with extraordinary experiences by leveraging Caesars Entertainment’s bulky portfolio across hospitality, entertainment and sports experiences.</p>
<p>Caesars’ push across the United States has been notable. The company is live in at least eight states with a sports betting product, and it has been putting a lot of work into its mobile app.</p>
<p>The Texans are likely hoping that some of Caesars’ success wears off on them. They went 4-12 last year as part of an abysmal season that included three different head coaches. Houston’s latest, former Baltimore Ravens assistant head coach David Culley, stepped in at the end of January and will make his field debut tomorrow when Texans take on the Green Bay Packers in the two teams’ first preseason game.</p>
