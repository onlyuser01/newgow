<p>Stakelogic has expanded its presence in Romania by signing a new local and prominent operator, with the company adding MaxBet.ro as its latest partner in the fast-evolving iGaming market in the country.</p>
<p>Both brands are tier-one companies in the iGaming industry, offering a strong, unique, and innovative products to their audiences. This is the first time that the two have worked together, too, as Stakelogic is only now debuting on MaxBet.ro and intends to scale its presence in Romania in general.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Stakelogic Senior Sales Manager Danila Dzehs said that the company brings an unrivalled level of fun to local audiences, making for exciting and entertaining gameplay across the board that can now be shared with players at MaxBet.ro.</p>
<p>He thanked the opportunity to see his company’s games arrive on another important market in Europe and argued that Stakelogic’s titles have already made their mark on another European market.</p>
<p>"This is another important partnership for us, adding a player-favorite operator to our impressive roster of customers. We now look forward to seeing MaxBet.ro players enjoy the max entertainment our games have allowed us to build our reputation on," Dzehs added.</p>
<p>Stakelogic features a ton of interesting classic and video slots for players to explore. Some of the most popular options are Multi6Player, Multi-Player, Bonus Runner, Runner RunnerMegaways, Big Runner Deluxe, along with games such as Treasures of Ra, Spartans vs ZombiesMegaways, Greedy Fox, Money Track 2, and more forthcoming releases that will be integrated directly with the MaxBet. rose portfolio.</p>
<p>MaxBet.ro Promotional Manager Secaci Matei was similarly excited about this partnership and said that the addition of the supplier’s games would allow the company to essentially "turbo-charge" its offer and add games that make sure that every spin at the website is loaded with fun.</p>
<p>"Classic or video, the developer’s slots are proven with players across Europe and they will absolutely be a big hit with ours in Romania," Matei wrapped up. Stakelogic has been pushing actively across the European region, including Sweden where the company teamed up with Glitnor Group and its casinos, Happy Casino and Lucky Casino, and Greece, where the supplier obtained a license recently, and rolled out with Fonbet. Similarly, the company expanded in Latvia.</p>
