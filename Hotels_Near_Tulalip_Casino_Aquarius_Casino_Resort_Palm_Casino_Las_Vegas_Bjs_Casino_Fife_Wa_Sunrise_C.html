<p>The global provider of B2B sportsbook and iGaming services has finally reached its launch stage, making an entry into the highly-lucrative market</p>
<p>FSB is teaming up with Fitzdares, a long-standing partner of the company, which is also a licensed operator that is currently licensed in Ontario. The company is now deploying its full suite of sportsbook and online casino aggregation solutions, along with support for the operator’s back office platform and more.</p>
<p>FSB’s First NA Launch Won’t Be Its Last</p>
<p>This marks the fourth continent in which FSB has been able to set up shop, with the company expecting to continue its global growth from there on in. FSB interim CEO Adam Smith has hailed the launch and its significance for the company.</p>
<p>He called it “positive news” and a hugely important milestone for his company, adding that Fitzdares was the right partner to explore the Ontario betting and gaming market with. Smith continued:</p>
<p>This enhanced relationship is a testament to the ambition we have to grow stronger together with our partners across multiple jurisdictions and regulated growth markets like Ontario. FSB interim CEO Adam Smith</p>
<p>He also confirmed that a second partner launch is imminent, as FSB is looking to consolidate its presence in the North American market. FSB CRO Ian Freeman was similarly optimistic about the significance of this development and what it meant for the company’s long-term opportunities:</p>
<p>Ontario will be a key jurisdiction within our core markets strategy and we’re passionate about playing a major role within one of the world’s leading and well-constructed regulated markets. FSB CRO Ian Freeman</p>
<p>All of this aligns with FSB’s plans announced at the end of the 2022. Back then, the company stated that it would focus on launching in Ontario, but it will not immediately push into the United States, focusing on its bastions and further growth in Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Europe. Ontario, though, remains a priority as well.</p>
