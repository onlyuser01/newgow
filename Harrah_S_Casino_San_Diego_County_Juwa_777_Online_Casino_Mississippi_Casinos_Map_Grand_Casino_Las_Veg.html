    <h1>Harrah S Casino San Diego County Juwa 777 Online Casino Mississippi Casinos Map Grand Casino Las Veg</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The reason I contact you today is that justbit.io is withholding my balance of 1.63533799 btc and 5.12948 ethereum and havenâ€™t given any indication that they are going to release it.</p>
<p>I have played with justbit.io since 10th of August 2023. It has been a pleasant experience until 17.10.23. 17.10.23, I received an email alleging a violation of paragraphs 59, 22 and 64 in their terms and conditions. I categorically deny these accusations.</p>
<p>Throughout my gameplay, I've maintained a standard approach to my gameplay. Justbit.io have encouraged it with increased limits, VIP managers and VIP bonuses indicating their perception of me as a losing player. I received these deposit bonuses and VIP offers often (I never accepted any bonus from them), all the way up until the same day as their email with accusations, 17.10.2023.</p>
<p>I have not taken advantage of any error or incompleteness at their site. All my activity has been in good faith and are in line with what any other gaming provider.</p>
<p>None of the terms 59, 22 and 64, which they (falsely) claim I have breached, says they can withhold my balance indefinitely or claim direct forfeiture, which they seem to be doing. I am yet to receive my deposits and/or winnings. 1.20318046 btc out of the 1.635335599 btc account balance consist of deposits. The eth on my account is winnings. I have deposited 4.2202212 eth and withdrawn 6 eth. I still have 5.12948797 eth in my account.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'd like to emphasize that the credibility of their assertion regarding breaches of terms appears to be minimal. I haven't placed a single spin or bet with justbit.io in weeks and they promptly approved my withdrawals without any hesitation during this time.</p>
<p>There is no serious ill-intentioned activity that takes weeks and multiple withdrawals before it clamped down upon. I want to emphasize I not have any ill-intentioned activity. This is done arbitrarily. This is done out of greed.</p>
<p>Your prompt attention to this matter is highly appreciated. Let me know if you need anything from me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Orde0</p>
