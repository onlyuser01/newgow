    <h1>Nugget Casino Wendover Nevada City Of Gold Casino Casino Royale 007 Theme Casinos In Laughlin Nevada</h1>

<p>Let me tell you something Charlie congrats and thank you for sharing your story because it means that you truly manned up and admitted your problem which 95% of addicts can’t or won’t do and I read what you said about 49 out of 50 spins where garbage well it can get a lot worse and I have over 8000 screenshots on my phone from a few online casinos and I’ve played them all and I have 1000% proof that they all cheat now I understand what a bold comment I’m making to whomever reads this and if a casino wants to call me out on this we’ll there’s a great chance that I’ll be able to tell them how they are cheating and proof with my screenshot s so stay away I’m not saying people can’t ever win but they are CHEATING again one more time I have indisputable proof one casino told me they are renting the software to there games ❤️🤣🤣🤣 seriously you know why they said that ? So they can pass the blame of the proof I have on to someone else random number generator you ever hear of that ? Well anyway what if I told you some slots run on an algorithm which after an hour or so runs the same outcome over and over again for instance I have the same screenshots of a certain slot I play and my screen shots are all on different days and my phone shows the date and time and yet I can show you the same winning screen shot multiple times on at least 5 different days do you understand that it’s impossible meaning we can’t even count the odds let alone 95% of the entire game is on my screen shots on multiple days as many as 10 or more I just found this out by accident and whomever reads this would you reply how this can possibly be random number generator? It’s not I can tell you what is going to happen on the next spin try me and I haven’t decided what I’m going to do with all this information especially the new stuff but if anything they aren’t cheating with running the algorithm they obviously don’t have a clue because a player could wipe them out like me I could change my bet from $1 to $10 When I know that the next spin or close to it will pay out 30 to 50 times my bet but I can also say while this is stupid in there part I can show how they cheat in 10 20 or even 30 different ways and we have the great people at guru on our side doing all they can and all these places still are willing to cheat us and be criminals? What if there was no guru imagine how bad it would be if it’s this bad with all those incredible people trying to protect us !! So again congrats and thanks for the mono stay strong and don’t doubt anything I’ve said in my above message because you will lose I have no reason or financial gain in any of this other then to warn others from getting there money stolen from them and I believe in god and believe there’s consequences when we do wrong or intentionally do things to hurt others so I commend you for your honesty and story although I may write a book for online players telling what to look for but if they read the book they will NEVER play understood? And it’s all true and any financial gain would go to addiction counselors or governments who turn these crooks in it must stop and on some websites they claim that they are closely monitored by some group that checks them for percentages of payout and that they are playing fair 100% baloney again cheating 10 to 30 different ways cmon again whomever is up for the challenge let me know if you think anything I’ve said above isn’t true or if you can prove me wrong and saying you won 5, 10 or 20k has nothing to do what I said above even a blind squirrel can find a nut so stop playing or check with guru and do your homework before depositing too bad I didn’t learn or hear about guru until recently and don’t be afraid to mention what the gurus rating is of that casino before depositing and read what other players have said it helped me out tremendously ✌️👍👏</p>
