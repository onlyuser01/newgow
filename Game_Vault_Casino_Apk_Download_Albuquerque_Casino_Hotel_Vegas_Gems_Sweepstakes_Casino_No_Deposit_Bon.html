<p>The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau (LVCVA) is expecting roughly 300,000 out-of-towners to make their way to Sin City for the Thanksgiving holiday this week.</p>

<p>The agency says those individuals will collectively spend around $226 million between Wednesday and Saturday, and more than 91 percent of the city’s 147,600 hotel rooms will be occupied.</p>
<p>Rooms can still be booked at several marquee properties including The Palazzo ($364 per night), Wynn ($179), and Bellagio ($195). Keep in mind the rates do not include taxes or those pesky daily resort fees.</p>
<p>Should 300,000 people make their way to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, it would be a 1.4 percent increase on the 2017 holiday.</p>
<p>Consumers have a lot to be thankful for this holiday season: higher wages, more disposable income, and rising levels of household wealth,” AAA Travel Senior VP Bill Sutherland said. “This is translating into more travelers kicking off the holiday season with a Thanksgiving getaway, building on a positive year for the travel industry.”</p>
<p>For those making their way to Las Vegas this week, the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada says peak travel times on I-15 southbound will be Saturday between 11 am and 6 pm PT, and Sunday between 11 am and 3 pm. The commission warns drivers to be prepared for longer commutes throughout the week.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving is a time when families come together, and while Las Vegas is known for its array of offerings allowing one to escape mundane life of wherever back home is, Sin City has become a favorite destination for many to spend the holiday.</p>
<p>The AAA ranks Las Vegas as the No. 5 2018 Thanksgiving destination. The association ranks its top 10 cities based on online and tour bookings made through the AAA’s travel agency.</p>
<p>Las Vegas follows Orlando at No. 1, New York City, Anaheim, and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Cancun, Dallas, Honolulu, Washington, and Miami round out the top 10.</p>
<p>AAA spokesman Michael Blasky said a stronger economy putting more money in Americans’ pockets is fueling a travel increase. It’s predicted that 48.5 million travelers will drive despite the highest nationwide gas prices in four years.</p>
<p>“Motorists have become accustomed to this year’s more expensive gas prices and won’t let higher fuel costs deter them from taking Thanksgiving road trips,” AAA gas price expert Jeanette Casselano stated.</p>
<p>VIP Guests</p>
<p>Las Vegas offers up the ultimate Thanksgiving smorgasbord when it comes to experiences, activities, and dining. Casino.org published its “15 Places to Eat Thanksgiving Dinner in Las Vegas 2018” earlier this month.</p>
<p>While 300,000 people are expected in Las Vegas Wednesday through Sunday, many more will be watching from around the country and world, as Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson arrive in Las Vegas for their one-on-one golf match on Black Friday.</p>
<p>The pay-per-view spectacle will pit the two golf superstars against one another in a $9 million winner-takes-all match. The competition is being played on MGM Resorts’ Shadow Creek Golf Course.</p>
<p>The match isn’t open to the public, but fans can watch the competition on television for $19.99.</p>
