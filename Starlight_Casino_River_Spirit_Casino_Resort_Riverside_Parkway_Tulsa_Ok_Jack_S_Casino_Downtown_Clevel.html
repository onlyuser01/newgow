<p>Hell Hot 100 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot has a fruit machine theme with a hellish setting.</p>
<p>Facing down a reel filled with classic fruit graphics, players will sweat their way through spins in the fiery fantasy world. Despite the heated twist, all the fruits definitely seem fresh and inviting rather than roasted.</p>
<p>Players looking to kick back with something classic may be drawn to this game, though the fruit machine theme will be familiar.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Reels spin with a satisfying ticking that will bring to mind an old- school casino slot machine. Occasional coin jingles complete the effect and players will find it easy to imagine they’re catching the cold coins straight out of the slot upon wins.</p>
<p>With the classic fruits animated in bright colours, the symbols will be familiar to experienced players. Just grapes, red cherries, sliced watermelon, and sour lemons are all plentiful on the reels. The style of animation is modern, with defined dark outlines around every piece of fruit.</p>
<p>The backdrop is a gradient of red and black, red, and orange. Sparks flutter up through the air occasionally, suggesting the game is taking place over a hot fire, or perhaps Hell itself.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and sound effects succeed in creating a classic fruit machine vibe and adding a Hell-themed twist.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Hell Hot 100 is a five reel, four row slot, with 100 win lines.</p>
<p>The Gamble feature allows players to potentially double their winnings by selecting a card from an infinite deck. If their card beats the dealer’s, they can play again if they choose to.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol pays out in any position on the reels.</p>
<p>There are minimal Bonus features available in this game.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.0%, exactly our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€1 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this average RTP, low volatility fruit machine-themed game.</p>
<p>Strategy conscious players should avoid this game for its sunken volatility alone, but any player will be less than impressed by the lack of varied bonus options.</p>
<p>The slot’s theme offers little to make up for these mediocre qualities. Players would have no difficulty finding a classic fruit machine game with more verve and a host of bonus features.</p>
<p>It is of little surprise that the popularity of this game is low, as it brings nothing that couldn’t be found in better quality elsewhere.</p>
