<p>The American Gaming Association has responded to a draft bill called "Betting on our Future Act," introduced by Congressman Paul D. Tonko, that aims to ban online and electronic advertisements of sports gambling. The bill would effectively limit the opportunity for licensed sportsbooks and gambling companies to promote their products.</p>
<p>The bill was submitted ahead of last Sundayâ€™s Super Bowl game, with the congressman arguing that the "unfettered advertisements" were running rampant ever since the Supreme Court of the United States legalized the activity in 2018. These "uncensored promotions," Tonko stated, needed to be put in check.</p>
<p>The trade group has responded to this proposal through its SVP Chris Cylke who said that AGA and its members opposed any attempts to ban or limit casino gaming advertisements, including the part that concerns sports gambling in the United States.</p>
<p>Rather than achieving the desired effect, a bill such as "Betting on our Future Act" would backfire and limit consumer exposure to legal and regulated betting products, allowing the illegal gambling sector to gain a foothold once again in the United States at a time when its reach has been steadily declining.</p>
<p>This, AGA said, was because of the responsible advertisement legitimate operators have been putting forward. Not least, a proposal such as this raised serious freedom of speech and constitutional concerns among industry members.</p>
<p>AGA reminded us that there are more than 5,000 commercial and tribal gaming regulators in the country. Cylke insisted that the industry was fully committed to maintaining a responsible gambling environment, which included the way the industry advertises its products and that, it would be dangerous to flirt with blanket bans that would stop legitimate operators from making their products known.</p>
<p>"Congress should instead focus its attention on combatting the predatory and pervasive offshore illegal market that offers no responsible gaming measures, age verification or problem gambling resources," Cylke concluded.</p>
<p>The call for a ban on gambling advertisements comes at a time of record interest in sports betting, as accounted by AGA and GeoComply, both of which gauged unprecedented numbers during Super Bowl LVII weekend.</p>
<p>AGA said that during its latest survey with bettors, 71% of respondents confirmed that they had seen responsible gambling messaging, a proof that the regulated market is having a strong impact on helping consumers find safe and secure betting options online.</p>
