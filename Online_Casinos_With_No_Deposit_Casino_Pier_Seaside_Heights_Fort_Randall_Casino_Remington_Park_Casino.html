<p>The globally-recognized iGaming operator and solutions provider, Soft2Bet, unveiled details on Tuesday regarding a new partnership with EveryMatrix's business-to-business aggregator SlotMatrix. The collaboration enabled the company to significantly expand the diversity of its games by bringing in content from SlotMatrix, including games from Armadillo Studios.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new collaboration, Soft2Bet was designated as one of the SlotMatrix Exclusive Partners. This enables the company to tap into a plethora of games from leading iGaming suppliers such as Nocturne Studios and JVL. To gain access to those games, Soft2Bet integrates SlotMatrix.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest deal, Soft2Bet will gain access to exciting and fan-favorite titles from Armadillo Studios. The iGaming developer's games have already proven to be popular within the US gambling market by delivering engaging mechanics. At the same time, the expert team of developers at Armadillo Studios strives to offer and create the best and most unique gaming experiences for online customers.</p>
<p>Daniel Mitton, Soft2Bet's Director of Gaming and Business Development, shared his excitement about the potential of the new partnership in a statement released on June 27, 2023.
