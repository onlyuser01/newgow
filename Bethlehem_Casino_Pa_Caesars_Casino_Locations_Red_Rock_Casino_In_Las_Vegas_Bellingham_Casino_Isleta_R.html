    <h1>Bethlehem Casino Pa Caesars Casino Locations Red Rock Casino In Las Vegas Bellingham Casino Isleta R</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play has deployed a dedicated Live Casino studio that is branded with Stake.com’s signature style and IP. The latest studio features 12 tables that will help bolster Stake’s Live Casino offer and introduce players at the gaming brand to dedicated and immersive experiences.</p>
<p>Stake.com Adds Branded Casino Powered by Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>To ensure that players are enjoying the best possible gameplay, Stake.com has chosen Pragmatic’s established technology and relied on the company’s track record for building outstanding solutions. Among the featured games are blackjack, roulette, and baccarat, which will be available to Stake.com’s global audiences.</p>
<p>Stake.com is following in similar footsteps as other established companies. Previously, Unibet, M88, Betway, and 888 have all worked with Pragmatic Play to establish dedicated Live Casino products that help the companies create a branded product that is easily marketable and focuses on their name and design exclusively.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides welcomed the latest opportunity with Stake.com and said that the company was committed to maintaining growth in the Live Casino segment, not least thanks to this new partnership.</p>
<p>The opportunity to deliver a branded studio that elevates the betting experience of Stake customers is one that we couldn’t shy away from, and we expect the new facility to be well received. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>Stake.com co-founder Edward Craven also welcomed the opportunity to work with Pragmatic and develop a dedicated custom studio that is designed to showcase Stake.com’s unique capabilities. Craven said that the company was very excited about the Live Casino product and content and was looking forward to seeing how the player base would respond to the new product.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been on a mission to expand its reach in new markets and with existing brands. The company recently announced that it is opening a studio in Sofia, Bulgaria, and vowed to hire 2,000 people by the end of 2023. Pragmatic Play’s expertise transcends Live Casino solutions and also includes bingo and slots.</p>
<p>The company recently introduced the Crown of Fire retro slot in a bid to consolidate its presence in the slot vertical. Pragmatic currently pushes out seven new slot titles each month and it’s also expanding its portfolio in the Live Casino segment through branded deals and boosting its overall production capacity.</p>
<p>The company is also present in the bingo segment, which is another important part of its market offer. The deal with Stake.com is a good one for Pragmatic Play as it would justify its rapid expansion in Europe and the creation of new streaming facilities.</p>
