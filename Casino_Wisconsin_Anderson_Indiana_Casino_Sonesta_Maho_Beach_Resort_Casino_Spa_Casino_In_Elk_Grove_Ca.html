    <h1>Casino Wisconsin Anderson Indiana Casino Sonesta Maho Beach Resort Casino Spa Casino In Elk Grove Ca</h1>

<p>i'm not quite sure whether it's really just because the politicians don't have a clue. they most likely don't - the fact, that people completely unfamiliar with the subject, evaluate and regulate very special and specific topics is unfortunately part of everyday politics. usually it's not very noticeable, at least if the affected population group is relatively small, doesn't put up enough resistance (or doesn't know how to stage this resistance in a media-effective way) or if there is no lobby with enough influence and capital.</p>
<p>(just to put my statements in the right perspective: i think that the misguided decisions concerning education policy or, for example, the care sector are far more drastic and worse than gambling issues.).</p>
<p>but the point is, however: the new laws and everything that is attached to them are, in my opinion, very well thought out (as stated in one of the previous posts: Generation of additional funds through taxation, strengthening of the state gambling monopoly, data collection &amp; initialization of various control instances also and especially concerning money transfers). Unfortunately, this is not even an aluhut theory, just a list of facts.</p>
<p>it doesn't matter at all what the decision makers actually know about the gambling industry or whether they know the gamblers' needs. or if they have an idea of how a meaningful support of gambling addicts (and those at risk) might look like. because thatÂ´s simple not the purpose of the exercise - it never was.</p>
