<p>Juicy Stakes Poker is one of the newest websites in the world of online poker, and as such, it has had to go some scrutiny. The website was launched way back in 2009 under a Curacao license, but it has taken the brand a while to appear on the Internet poker map.</p>
<p>Today, the website caters to both players in the US and Australia, and elsewhere, extends some juicy poker bonuses and has a vibrant poker community. Juicy Stakes Poker offers a very tempting 200% bonus up to $1,000 on your first deposit.</p>
<p>Our guide will help give you a first look at Juicy Stakes – the available games, payment options, software, bonus codes, poker network, support, and Reddit opinions by your fellow players.</p>
<p>Before you continue with the Juicy Stakes Poker review, rest assured that we have done our best to provide you with the most accurate information synthesized from both our own research and what we have read on community boards from fellow players.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker Bonus Code</p>
<p>Claiming the $1,000 Welcome Bonus at Juicy Stakes Poker is a piece of cake. All you need to do is set your account and make a minimum qualifying deposit, which is $25. To claim the bonus, though, you will need to use the Juicy Stakes Poker bonus code, 100JUICY, and trigger the promo.</p>
<p>Once you receive the funds matched at 200% up to $1,000, you are ready to play. To release your bonus, you need to start playing and earn Frequently Player Points or (FFPs). They are released in increments of $5 for every 83.335 FPPs you rake up.</p>
<p>And to get those, all you need to do is join ring games for $1 Rake (1FPP) or tournaments for $1 Fee (7 FPP). Releasing your bonus is very natural and as long as you play a bit every day, you should have no trouble meeting the 90 days deadline.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker Promotions</p>
<p>Players who are looking for more in the way of poker bonuses won’t regret stopping by Juicy Stakes Poker. The card room has quite a few opportunities for players looking to boost their bankroll outside the Poker Welcome Bonus. We have provided you with a brief overview of each.</p>
<p>Depositor Freeroll</p>
<p>The Depositor Freeroll is a monthly tournament offering a chance to join the namesake tournament. What you need to do is deposit $25 and earn at least 10 FPPs to participate in the event.</p>
<p>To register for the tournament, you need to go to the ‘My tournaments’ tab and click on ‘Tournaments I have a ticket for,’ followed by a click on ‘Juicy Stakes Depositor Freeroll.’ Keep in mind that you need to turn over 50% of your freeroll cash winnings as gross rake before you can withdrawal.</p>
<p>Non-Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>The Juicy Stakes Poker no deposit bonus is not a traditional one. Rather the website has a non-deposit bonus designed to help you play using a unique currency known as Gold Chips. However, you do have to pay for the currency with FIAT money beforehand.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get players confused, but once you figure out the logic, it’s going to be alright. You can buy GCs at a rate of $5 for 20 GCs, $25 for 100 GGs and $100 for 400 GCs. You can convert your FPPs into 1 Gold Chip.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Rakeback</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker is no different when it comes to rake. The operator collects the fee to support tournaments and offer a state-of-the-art experience to US players. Now, in terms of rakeback, Juicy Stakes averages 36% of what you have paid in rake fees during the week.</p>
<p>There is no minimum amount you must achieve. Both Australian and US players are eligible for this website feature. Comparing rakeback, Juicy Stakes pulls ahead of other poker sites, including Americas Cardroom where the rakeback is solid but still 26%.</p>
<p>Bovada and BetOnline in comparison average 1.5% and 5.7% rakeback on average, which is still not too bad.</p>
<p>Deposits and Withdrawals</p>
<p>Players from the USA will be happy to know that Juicy Stakes Poker offers a very decent selection of payment options. The website features nine depositing methods and five withdrawal options presently. Every transaction and detail is broken down neatly in an infobox, so you always know what to expect. You can bank with one of the following:</p>
<p>Visa</p>
<p>MasterCard</p>
<p>American Express</p>
<p>Skrill</p>
<p>Neteller</p>
<p>Sofort</p>
<p>Bitcoin</p>
<p>Cash Transfer</p>
<p>Neosurf</p>
<p>The minimum deposit is $25 and the maximum deposit $5,000. Withdrawals will vary based on the payment method you use. The minimum amount you can cash out is $25 via Skrill and Neteller.</p>
<p>Most processing time is listed as 48 hours but you will need to wait 4-6 business days for Check transfers and 15 business days for Bank Transfers. Most players prefer to go after the more intuitive cashout options, such as Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Some fees may apply here and there, but all of those are duly displayed in an infobox you can access by clicking on the little icon next to each payment method. The maximum withdrawal amounts will range from $1,050 for checks to $2,560.</p>
<p>There are no fees for withdrawals via Skrill, Neteller, and Bitcoin, so most US players tend to opt for these payment options when available.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker Software &amp; Games</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker has a selection of great games and flexible betting limits, from No-Limit Hold’em and Fixed Limit Hold’em to Omaha Hi/Lo. The stakes start at as low as $0.01/$0.02 and go all the way up to $500/$1,000 in some games.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes also features versions of Stud poker, for those who prefer to try something different. Gameplay at the website is powered by an intuitive HTML5 platform, which makes it easy to participate in the action.</p>
<p>You can bet $0.02/$0.04 on all available games and gradually find games that ask a little more in the way of commitment. The maximum on most games can vary between $10/$20, $50/$100, and $500/$1,000 as mentioned before.</p>
<p>So far as cash games go, the lowest you can bet on is $0.01/$0.02 on No-Limit Texas Hold’em. Overall, there is a good variety and selection of titles available. To top its offer off, Juicy Poker runs Sit &amp; Go’s ranging from $0.50 and $200.</p>
<p>You can find a number of three, six, and eight-player tournaments and there is a great variety. However, most players on the website tend to gravitate towards games that require $10 or less to participate in.</p>
<p>Another addition is the availability of MMTs or Multi-Table Tournaments. These events run from Monday through Sunday offering players enough variety. The cash prizes will vary between $500 and $1,000, but there are usually bigger events during the weekend.</p>
<p>Overall, US players will find enough worthwhile games and tournament action to choose from at Juicy Stakes Poker.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker Network</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker network is none other than the Horizon Poker Network. The network is a member of the same poker ecosystem as is Intertops poker. Now, Horizon doesn’t attract nearly as much interest as does Ignition Poker, but it’s still a vibrant community where hundreds of online poker players come to play.</p>
<p>While Ignition is solely focused on the United States, the Horizon Poker Network allows players from Australia to also participate, offering a slightly more diverse online ecosystem. Previously, Juicy Stakes used to be part of the Cake Poker Network.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s hard not to be happy with the quality offered by Juicy Stakes Poker, even if the website is still catering to fewer people than the #1 and #2 poker sites for US traffic.</p>
<p>What Countries Is Juicy Stakes Poker Available To?</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker has a truly global footprint, albeit there are some restrictions you ought to be mindful of. Presently, the website doesn’t accept players from Spain and France and some specific US states, including:</p>
<p>Kentucky</p>
<p>Louisiana</p>
<p>Maryland</p>
<p>Missouri</p>
<p>New Jersey</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>This list is often subject to changes so a quick stop by the Terms &amp; Conditions never hurts. You can catch yourself up on what jurisdictions are currently restricted by opening a chat window with Juicy Stakes Poker support, too.</p>
<p>How Does Juicy Stakes Poker Do on Mobile?</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker feels and plays great on mobile devices. The website is fully optimized to provide players with the necessary level of comfort thanks to HTML5. In other words, both Android and iOS users will have no issue running poker directly through the instant play platform.</p>
<p>As soon as you set your Juicy Stakes account, you can already log into the lobby and explore the variety of games, tournaments, and promotions available to all players.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker Support</p>
<p>To get in touch with support, you can rely on a 24/7 line of communication either via the live chat option or by emailing to [email protected]. The customer agents will be able to assist with any difficulty you may experience playing at Juicy Stakes Poker.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker Review – A Final Word</p>
<p>Overall, Juicy Stakes Poker is a great, even if somewhat low-key online poker card room. It’s designed to cater perfectly to the tastes and needs of US players and supports global access to provide a motley player base.</p>
<p>The website’s dedication to bringing you the best multi-table tournaments, sit &amp; go’s and adequately-priced cash games are appreciated.</p>
<p>Players may download a dedicated poker client and play from a desktop computer or Mac if they prefer, but the Instant Play option works a treat, and players are encouraged to go mobile as often as they like.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker offers a state-of-the-art poker experience complemented by frequent tournaments, great bonuses, and a reliable 24/7 customer support that is always there for you. If you are looking for a slightly less competitive and soft poker room where safety and security are high and games flow easy, Juicy Stakes Poker is your go-to solution.</p>
