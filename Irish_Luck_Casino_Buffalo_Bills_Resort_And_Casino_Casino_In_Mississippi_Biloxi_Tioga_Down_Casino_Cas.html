    <h1>Irish Luck Casino Buffalo Bills Resort And Casino Casino In Mississippi Biloxi Tioga Down Casino Cas</h1>

<p>This milestone achievement enables the company to provide its games to operators that hold an MGA license, allowing it to grow its reach</p>
<p>The leading online casino games developer powering the iGaming sector, Octoplay, announced it secured a license from the gambling regulator in Malta, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). Details regarding the new license emerged Monday. Thanks to the latest approval from the MGA, Octoplay can now provide its leading services and content to operators that hold a license from the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Holding an MGA license allows the company to deliver its fan-favorite and popular slot machine games to new partners. The license enables Octoplay to provide MGA-licensed operators access to its remote game server. By tapping into the company’s remote gaming server, the gambling operators can expand their offering, gaining access to a range of slot games and thrilling titles, such as Bullet Bonanza, Lolicat and Pearly Shores, among others.</p>
<p>Only recently, Octoplay announced it secured an ISO 27001 certification. The innovative supplier confirmed back in July that it secured the highest technical standard for its information security as well as data management. Now, the recent license from the MGA complements the company’s growth and it comes after it secured licenses in Sweden, Romania and the UK, among other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Securing the License Marks an Exciting Moment for Octoplay</p>
<p>Carl Ejlertsson, Octoplay’s CEO and founder, explained that the company delivers a wide range of games that every operator will like. Moreover, he outlined that Octoplay seeks to expand the reach of its games by accessing different regulated markets. “Securing our Malta license is a major step forward to achieving this, and we look forward to seeing our games land in the lobbies of popular online casino brands in markets across Europe and beyond,” said Ejlertsson in conclusion.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Octoplay inked a new content agreement with Rootz. Thanks to that collaboration, Rootz and its brands gained access to a range of games provided by the leading iGaming content provider.</p>
<p>“We are committed to obtaining a license in every single regulated market in the world and securing our Malta license has been a priority for us. This license significantly increases the distribution of our games in core jurisdictions across the globe.“ Nick Vuchev, commercial director at Octoplay</p>
<p>Nick Vuchev, Octoplay’s commercial director, was similarly excited about the recently secured license in Malta and explained that this was one of the company’s priorities. Additionally, he highlighted that Octoplay considers expanding the reach of its games by securing licenses in different jurisdictions across the globe.</p>
<p>Vuchev added that the company is proud of the newly secured license from the regulator in Malta. Finally, he said that through this license, Octoplay will further expand the reach of its content and deliver it to new operators.</p>
