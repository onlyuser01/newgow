<p>Dynamic online slots and casino games provider BGaming has scored a strategic deal with the international sports betting company Parimatch.</p>
<p>BGaming Pens a Deal with Parimatch</p>
<p>As per the deal, BGaming will power Parimatch’s offerings with several of its best iGaming titles. Some of those will include games such as Dig Dig Digger, Fruit Million, and WBC Ring of Riches. The new games will help to attract more clients to Patimatch’s offerings and will improve the bookmaker’s overall standings.</p>
<p>BGaming, on the other hand, also has a lot to benefit from the deal. Mainly, the deal will help the business-to-business company to establish a stronger presence in Belarus – a market it has set its eyes on. Once it has established a strong foothold, BGaming will be able to easily expand within Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>This, however, isn’t BGaming’s first step in this market. BGaming first stepped in Belarus through another strategic deal that the slots and casino games provider inked with the online betting operator GrandCasino back in April 2021.</p>
<p>BGaming is Glad to Expand in Its Country of Origin</p>
<p>Alexandr Shavel, BGaming’s head of the business development department, spoke more about the deal and the importance of Belarus to the company.</p>
<p>For starters, BGaming is a studio of Belarusian origin, Shavel explained, confirming that this is why the B2B company is so focused on it.</p>
<p>“We think the Dig Dig Digger slot, produced in association with Belarusian comedian Vadim Galygin, will be extremely popular among players,” Shavel said.</p>
<p>The online slots and casino games provider added that it has been approved by Belarus’ gambling regulator and will continue adding up more games for Parimatch players in the future.</p>
<p>As for the deal itself, Shavel said that BGaming is delighted to be able to partner with Parimatch and is looking forward to conjointly working with the operator in this and other markets.</p>
<p>In total, BGaming’s portfolio of over 70 games has been adopted by more than 550 casinos across the globe. Although Belarus holds a sentimental value for BGaming, it isn’t the only region where the company operates.</p>
<p>The provider recently secured deals with various operators in various regions. At the beginning of December last year, BGaming was approved by Greece’s gambling regulator, the Hellenic Gaming Commission, making it the second big licensing for the company after Malta. Then, at around the end of 2021, BGaming scored yet another important deal, this time with the leading German social gaming operator Ousley Games.</p>
