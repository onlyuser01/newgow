    <h1>Best Western Plus Casino Royale Center Strip Palms Casino Resort Reviews Casinos In Mobile Alabama B</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am writing this complaint as Gunsbet support have constantly said to contact DPO Dama N.V. which I have done and they have went silent now on the matter so now I am trying to resolve this through here.</p>
<p>This matter is in relation to responsible gambling not followed towards the player.</p>
<p>Please note.</p>
<p>An email that was sent and received from Dama N.V. states blocking dates were correct initially with the 2019 year. Dama N.V. have also stated they cannot help with regards to refunds as they are the Data Protection Officer and only deal with Data not in regards to funds.</p>
<p>A message that I wrote to Dama N.V.:</p>
<p>I'm contacting you in relation to the blocking dates again. In previous emails you stated that I was correct with 25.11.2019 and you confirmed as such in your emails.</p>
<p>This is again confirmed then by the chat transcripts and the various messages through the multiple sites that confirmed this date above and previous dates. (Screenshots can be provided)</p>
<p>A message to all support in this email(Sent to sites operated by Dama N.V.):</p>
<p>This blocking date was confirmed by the administration Direx N.V. which should have transferred/stayed the same when the take over was done by Dama N.V., you still have records as such of previous sites signed up to in 2019 as can be seen from the information that has been provided to me by you. Data retention was completed by Direx N.V. but not followed through with by Dama N.V., it may have been human error or a technical fault but the evidence is there to state that the administration at the time, Direx N.V., had blocked me from accessing their sites and when you took over the action should have been continued as such. This unfortunately was not the case. That error falls with you and your sites administration as the information was passed along but failed to continue on your end.</p>
<p>I refer you to (Terms and conditions):</p>
<p>Data Recipients</p>
<p>We may pass information that you have given us to other entities within our group of companies and to our business partners. These companies include our parent companies, their parent companies and all of the subsidiaries of these respective companies, as well as other companies with whom we carry out business and hold necessary agreements. Data processing of your information may be undertaken by the Company or by another entity in our group of companies, which may use a third party to fulfill such data processing needs.</p>
<p>Employees of the Company, more specifically Data Protection Officer, Money Laundering Officer, Payments &amp;Anti-Fraud analysts, Customer Support agents, Customer Retention team members, VIP player managers as well as other selected employees, shall also have access to your Personal Information for the purpose of executing their duties and providing you with assistance.</p>
<p>Also in regards to your (terms and conditions):</p>
<p>Releasing Data To Third Parties</p>
<p>Should the Company undergo any changes to its structure such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a partial acquisition, it is most likely that our customersâ€™ personal data will be included within the sale or transfer.</p>
<p>Dama N.V. knew everything about my personal information and also acquired my personal information from Direx N.V. as can be seen through the information provided back to 2019. If my personal information was not acquired through the "takeover" of Direx N.V. how did you, Dama N.V., acquire my information? The operation of the sites stayed the same and the only thing that changed was the ownership which went from Direx N.V. to Dama N.V.</p>
<p>As the records state, which have been provided by Dama N.V., and clearly show my Data was acquired by Dama N.V. in the "takeover" my information was not blocked across the system, I was not informed by Direx N.V./Dama N.V. of such an event.</p>
<p>This is the evidence that was requested of me to show proof of the administration blocking initially but failing to continue to carry out the action throughout it's system. My email and personal information was initially blocked under Direx N.V. but failed to continue to do so under the new ownership of Dama N.V.</p>
<p>This is the above statement that was sent to Gunsbet and several other Dama N.V. operated sites and the answer I received was contact DPO Dama N.V., I did and received no response.</p>
<p>The issue I have is Direx N.V. had all my information on file and as per the emails I received if I attempted to sign up to any sites my information was blocked immediately (Name, DOB, Address, etc.) Dama N.V. took over and they allowed the sign up to happen yet kept my information from Direx N.V. and could provide it to me when requested.</p>
<p>They did not follow through with my request and as such I am requesting a refund of funds for the lack of responsible gambling towards the player which they had that information on file but failed to follow through with.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
