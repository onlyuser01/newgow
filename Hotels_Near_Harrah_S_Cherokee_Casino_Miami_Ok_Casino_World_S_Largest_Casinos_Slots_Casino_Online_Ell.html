    <h1>Hotels Near Harrah S Cherokee Casino Miami Ok Casino World S Largest Casinos Slots Casino Online Ell</h1>

<p>i would like to say to begin i have jumped through hurdles to do what this site has asked. i had multiple attempts of trying to withdraw from the site, changing currencies from aud to btc. supplying everything they kept asking for, one thing after another but we came through, well i came through. even learning how much i am even spending with crypto etc hasent been easy. i finally achieved a withdrawel of 45 mbtc on the 17/12 which is 1100 aud.</p>
<p>so this led me to believe that all the hurdles where crossed on this issue. so i went in hard and played and did my part with no issues at all with any deposits why would they, after all their getting paid. im here speanding thousands of dollers constantly losing and then finally getting a win of and go for the withdrawel, at the same time showing off this site to my friends whilst they are saying its a mission to get a withdrawels out of them but me thinking that i got it all figured out i try to do a withdrawel of 249mbtc roughly 6200 in aud.</p>
<p>which exceeds the withdrawel limits they have set at 140mbtc. so i change the withdrawel to 140mbtc which is still pending from the 23/12/22 no emails or any information passed on to me i have had repeated attempts to try figure out what the problem is with the same replys of</p>
<p>we kindly ask you to wait as your withdrawel is in a line up queue to be reviewed.......</p>
<p>so i ask for whaat reason with non answers .</p>
<p>day after day asking i also have x6 other withdrawels pending waiting and hoping that they honour their word but i get the same answer of</p>
<p>we are sorry but it will be a couple hours or some other ridiclious excuse.</p>
