<p>Sports Information Services (SIS) has announced two senior appointments as part of its international growth strategy. The former head of trading, Adam Conway, has been promoted to head of competitive gaming and Aiden Tracey, who worked as a racing trading manager, has been promoted to head of racing trading.</p>
<p>SIS Is Looking To Strengthen Its Products</p>
<p>The SIS product director, Conleth Byrne, shared a few words on the new appointments and said that with the two new appointments, the company is looking to strengthen its trading and competitive gaming products.</p>
<p>Byrne also added that these products proved to be extremely popular on the international scene and the number of operators that are integrating them is increasing. He concluded by saying that both Conway and Tracey have plenty of experience and will be valuable assets to SIS in its quest to grow.</p>
<p>With Conway’s appointment, SIS will accelerate the product offer and continue to build on the success of its esports product. Conway has over 20 years of working experience in the gaming and betting industry and will oversee SIS Competitive Gaming’s operations.</p>
<p>SIS Competitive Gaming has specifically designed for sportsbooks and it provides bettors with the chance to bet and watch live broadcasts of H2H esports events such as esoccer, CS:GO and ebasketball.</p>
<p>Tracey, on the other hand, has been part of the SIS team for the past five years. He joined the company as a horse racing trader. With the new appointment, he will be overseeing racing trading offering that provides customers with more than 100,000 wagering opportunities annually.</p>
<p>SIS is looking to capitalize on the market opportunities, which is why the company has announced quite a few appointments in 2022. Apart from the 2 new promotions, SIS also appointed Julian Wheeler as its new chief technology officer. Wheeler has over 20 years of working experience and will oversee the tech department of the company.</p>
<p>SIS Is a Leading Multi-Channel Supplier of Live Betting</p>
<p>SIS was founded in 1986 and thanks to its comprehensive service, the company managed to rise to the very top of the industry. It provides engaging content that spans across greyhound races, horse racing, live number draws, esports and virtuals.</p>
<p>The main goal of SIS is to maximize the value of its partners with short-form betting events every 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Some of the leading brands that SIS has partnered with throughout the years include bet365, Betway, BetVictor, Betfair, Admiral, Meridianbet, William Hill, Unibet, SkyBet, Paddy Power and PointsBet.</p>
<p>In March, SIS expanded its partnership with bet365 and thanks to the new agreement, bet365’s greyhound racing offers have been boosted. Both companies are set to reap the benefits of the deal, which will apply over the next 5 years.</p>
