    <h1>Free Casino Slot Games For Fun No Download Best Odds In Casino Casino Near Palm Springs Palace Casin</h1>

<p>Hi, let me introduce myself, my name is Giuseppe. I signed up on April 16, 2022 on casinoly1.com attracted above all by the graphics that represent the Roman Empire (I'm from Rome). I started by depositing € 850 and then making a total of € 10,150 deposited within 18 days. I then started to win and my rank became that of Senator (you are rewarded with a ranking that goes from Roman Citizen to Emperor, for a total of 5 levels) with the possibility of withdrawing € 15,000 per month. So I started to withdraw, but in a month, given the long waiting times, they paid me only € 9,000. I would also have been satisfied after all, but at a certain point I found myself demoted to the rank of Roman citizen (the first degree), with the possibility of a maximum withdrawal of € 500 per day and € 7,000 per month. I asked the reason for this relegation and they justified themselves by saying that the progression is due to the deposit-withdrawal-bet ratio. Now it is clear that always having a positive balance I don't need to deposit money, but I play an average of € 20-30,000 every day for a period of 6-7 hours a day, but my rank remains steady. I also made a bitcoin deposit to see if the crypto currency withdrawal was faster, but nothing, within 10 days they paid me only € 1,500, which a month makes € 4,500 compared to the € 7,000 that theirs promises. VIP page. In fact, on this page they describe the advantages for Vip players, writing that they have "Financial Privileges" that allow them to "enjoy incredibly high withdrawal limits in record short times" (verbatim). I wrote countless times to VIP assistance, but first they justified themselves with a technical problem in payments, then always in an approximate way, they told me that progress is managed by the software and complies with the "terms and conditions" of the site; but that is not true, because the terms are what they advertise with "incredibly high withdrawals and in record time". Moral: I'm winning € 181,000, and doing a calculation I should be able to collect my winnings within 5-6 years. Is all this possible? A "pension" can also be good for me, but that at least respected the amounts and times of their regulation. Exasperated, frustrated and even bored, because I strive to win but receive very little, I wrote to them to make a compromise, that is, I give up a percentage of the win if they pay me in a single solution and then I delete myself from the site forever; but they did not utter a word in response to my proposal. Please give me a hand, I don't want privileges, I want the right.</p>
<p>Thank you. Joseph.</p>
