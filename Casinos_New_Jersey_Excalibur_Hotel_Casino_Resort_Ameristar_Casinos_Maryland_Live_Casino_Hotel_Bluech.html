<p>Pragmatic Play Ltd has revealed two new Indian-focused table games by the name of Andar Bahar and Roulette India. The games will seek to expand on the existing player base while adding new experiences that may attract new players as well.</p>
<p>The first addition to the Pragmatic Play’s lineup is Andar Bahar, a card game that is a player-favorite option with the majority of Indian consumers. Pragmatic Play has spruced up the traditional gameplay by adding poker-style side bets, including a straight flush for those who seek to have even more fun out of their gaming sessions.</p>
<p>The game is available for multiple devices and is built on HTML5 to guarantee compatibility with Android and iOS firmware. Andar Bahar is a live dealer experience where players get to play in the company of a professional live dealer who makes it easy for people to follow through with the action.</p>
<p>Live Roulette India Adds Twists to a Traditional Game</p>
<p>Next, the company brings a unique twist on a popular casino classic in Roulette India. The game is available 24 hours every day and streamed with the help of multiple 4K cameras.</p>
<p>There are numerous additional features here, including custom and special bet types, the company explains in an official press release. According to Pragmatic Play, Roulette India is the latest successful foray into the tailored casino experience that features a specific approach to local markets.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely had this to add: “Andar Bahar is an iconic card game that will appeal to many, and we’re very pleased to be able to add it to our offering.</p>
<p>Combined with Roulette India, we’re continuing to add more niche game content to our Live offering, and we’re extremely excited about the trajectory our Live Casino offering is on.”</p>
<p>Building up the Portfolio in Existing and New Markets</p>
<p>Both games focus exclusively on the live segment in a bid to strike home with Indian players and traditional player bases that are keen to explore games from other cultures. The low-streaming latency technology used by the company guarantees a smooth and fulfilling experience that will make these two games easy to play and experience on the go.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has marked several successful deals over the last weeks. The company an A1 supplier license to expand its operations in Greece and the company’s products were launched with QTech Games.</p>
