<p>The industry’s leading provider of next-gen betting content and data BETER has agreed to power the esports data company Abios with its esoccer and ebasketball content. This deal was made possible by Betbazar, a company that connects suppliers with operators.</p>
<p>Abios Wants to Capitalize on Esports’ Popularity</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, Abios will now be able to distribute data for BETER’s acclaimed esoccer and ebasketball data. The latter company covers more than 14,000 matches every month, providing valuable insights to esports bettors. As a result, Abios will be able to reinforce its offer and create an “all-in-one esoccer and ebasketball product for sportsbooks.”</p>
<p>Through this deal, Abios seeks to capitalize on the rapidly growing esports betting market. The company believes that the pandemic has laid the foundations for a flourishing esports betting industry, especially when it comes to digital versions of beloved sports such as esoccer and ebasketball.</p>
<p>In addition, such esports are becoming increasingly popular among sports fans during the off-seasons when not much happens.</p>
<p>Capitalizing on the Popularity of Esports</p>
<p>BETER is happy to assist Abios and provide it with its esports data. Gal Ehrlich, chief executive of the former company, shared that his team is looking forward to working with Abios and supplying it with BETER’s esports content. Ehrlich also thanked Betbazar for making this deal possible and providing BETER with a valuable partner such as Abios.</p>
<p>Abios’ founder and chief executive, Oskar Fröberg, also shared his thoughts on the deal. He lauded BETER as an industry leader when it comes to betting and gaming content.</p>
<p>By expanding our esoccer and ebasketball offering through our partnership with Betbazar and BETER, we hope to help sportsbooks fill in the gaps in the highly seasonal sports calendar and provide engaging 24/7 content for sports fans. Oskar Fröberg, CEO, Abios</p>
<p>Fröberg added that Abios knows how profitable esports can be and hopes to satisfy the growing demand for esports betting data and products.</p>
<p>Lastly, Max Sevostianov, chief operating officer for Betbazar, said that Betbazar is happy about this new partnership.</p>
<p>It is a privilege to be able to perfectly match the right buyer with the right seller in this way. BETER has exactly the right products to ensure Abios’ continued growth. Max Sevostianov, COO, Betbazar</p>
<p>According to Sevostianov, it attests to the growing popularity of esports and next-gen offerings as a whole. He noted that such products are slowly becoming a staple to each betting company’s portfolio as operators and data providers aim to cater to younger punters.</p>
