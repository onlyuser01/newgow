<p>Gamanza will now explore opportunities to further expand its market reach and distribution</p>
<p>Swiss online gaming operator, Gamanza Games, announced the launch of the first in-house developed title, Air Racer, exclusively with the company’s online casino operator partners.</p>
<p>Another Milestone for the Business</p>
<p>The launch of the first certified crash game in the regulated Swiss iGaming market offers online players with jackpots.ch, goldengrand.ch, GAMRFIRST.ch, and 7melons.ch an opportunity to taste the thrill and excitement of the exhilarating action of Air Racer.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of Air Racer, Gamanza’s chief commercial officer Robert Civill outlined the development as another milestone for the company which became “the first platform to launch an online casino operation under Swiss iGaming regulations.”</p>
<p>Hailing the launch of the “first crash game on the market” as “another feather in the cap,” Civill was delighted to see the game go live with Gamanza’s partner sites, expecting “to see Air Racer maintain strong commercial performance on a long-term basis while the company is planning to “follow up soon with more unique, arcade-style game releases, as well as some classics.”</p>
<p>Offering players thrilling crash mechanics and a range of betting options, including the facility to place up to three bets per game, Air Racer brings a unique and exciting genre to the local iGaming landscape. Equipped with an auto-play mode, the game also allows players to set target multipliers for each bet via its auto cash-out feature.</p>
<p>Setting High Industry Standards</p>
<p>Being the first certified crash game in Switzerland means that Air Racer’s immersive gaming experience will set a high standard for gaming experience and innovation for the games that will follow. For the Gamanza Games, the launch of Air Racer signifies the company’s commitment to catering to the needs of regulated markets by delivering exceptional gaming solutions.</p>
<p>Incorporated in 2019 after an investment from one of the largest leisure and entertainment groups in Switzerland, Stadtcasino Baden AG, Gamanza Group AG paves the way for the first legal online casino, Grand Casino Baden’s online brand, jackpots.ch.</p>
<p>From the moment of its inception until it is fully acquired by its investor in 2021 to become part of the Stadtcasino Baden group, Gamanza signed partnerships with five other land-based casinos in the country.</p>
<p>Combining its know-how in iGaming with its parent’s experience and reputation in brick-and-mortar gaming, Gamanza offers an appealing proposition for land-based casinos seeking to enter the iGaming space, providing support during the licensing process and modern tools for success.</p>
