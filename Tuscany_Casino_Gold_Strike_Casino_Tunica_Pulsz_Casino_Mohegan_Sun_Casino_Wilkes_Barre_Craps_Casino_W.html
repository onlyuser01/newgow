    <h1>Tuscany Casino Gold Strike Casino Tunica Pulsz Casino Mohegan Sun Casino Wilkes Barre Craps Casino W</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I request a full refund of all deposits made at this casino as I have a permanent self-exclusion on the sister casino Vegas plus. The CEG guidelines under which Vegas plus which activated permanent self-exclusion operates state the following:</p>
<p>SELF-EXCLUSION</p>
<p>The self-exclusion option is a brokerage service offered by Cura√ßao eGaming.</p>
<p>By sending a request for self-exclusion, the end user (player) activates a mandatory procedure for the operator</p>
<p>to interrupt the services to the end user for a minimum of 6 (six) months as per the IP-Agreement between CEG and the operator. Go</p>
<p>to the seal of your casino website to request the self-exclusion feature.</p>
<p>RESPONSIBLE GAMING, SELF-EXCLUSION, CODE OF CONDUCT</p>
<p>Introductory</p>
<p>In this section, the rules and regulations regarding general policies on Responsible Gaming,</p>
<p>Self Exclusion and Application of the Code of Conduct ("CoC") and Responsible Gaming Standards and Self Exclusion</p>
<p>("SRGS").</p>
<p>The Operator is responsible for the proper execution of the general policies and CoCs of the CEGs</p>
<p>CEG determines the most important general policies for End Users. Policies are transparent and therefore made</p>
<p>and these policies should be in line with international standards of good practice</p>
<p>industrial. The Operator, as the one who deals directly with the End Users, is responsible for the correctness</p>
<p>execution of such policies.</p>
