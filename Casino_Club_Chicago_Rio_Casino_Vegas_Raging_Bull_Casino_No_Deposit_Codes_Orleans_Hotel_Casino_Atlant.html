    <h1>Casino Club Chicago Rio Casino Vegas Raging Bull Casino No Deposit Codes Orleans Hotel Casino Atlant</h1>

<p>Is "this" the money that gets snatched out of your balance WHILE PLAYING? Where as the "other bonus $" you have to omit from the withdraw??</p>
<p>Like.... I was playing. Spinning. My balance got up way too high for a withdraw (limits). Raised my bet to like $2.50 and was spinning trying to get it to allowable withdraw. While I was spinning I noticed my balance was short $530 since last spin. THIS brought me down to about $85 before I noticed it and never could get it back to the $100 min/max withdraw.</p>
<p>Lost that money AND the hard work that went into it.</p>
<p>THIS has happened to me 3 times. 3 different Casinos</p>
<p>I feel this is an extremely SHADY practice. 2 of those times I was never able to make the withdraw. 1 of those times I was only able to withdraw the $50 on a $100 max w/d</p>
