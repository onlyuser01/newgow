<p>The leading iGaming content provider, Spinomenal, announced the return of its popular and fan-favorite Grand Holiday Tournaments. The company confirmed Wednesday that the tournaments return this September, offering multiple different rounds, culminating with a Super Round and a total prize pool of 500,000€ ($542,900).</p>
<p>Judging by a statement released by Spinomenal, Grand Holiday Tournaments will start on September 28, 2023. Then, for six months, they will run through February 28, 2024, delivering thrilling experiences for participants and a chance for big prizes.</p>
<p>The Grand Holiday Tournaments will include seven distinct tournaments. Those include Wealth Seekers, Holiday Spirits, HalloWins, New Year Luck, Stana's Gifts, Winter Fortunes and Festival of Love. Not unexpectedly and as the names suggest, the tournaments match popular holidays.</p>
<p>Nir Ronen, Spinomenal's CCO, shared his excitement about the recently launched tournaments. "Grand Holiday Tournaments has become a firm fixture for slots enthusiasts and we’re thrilled to welcome back this year's competition," he said. Finally, Ronen pointed out: "The seven separate tournaments bring something for everyone and of course, there is the substantial 500,000€ prize pool in reach for players. Good luck to one and all."</p>
<p>An important feature of Spinomenal's tournaments are the impressive prize pools. Every round of each tournament, including the Super Rounds, includes its own prize pool. This makes the total aggregate prize pool for all tournaments throughout the Grand Holiday campaign a staggering 500,000€ ($542,900).</p>
<p>To easily track their progress, players who participate in the Grand Holiday Tournaments can check the Leaderboard. Once a player reaches a qualifying score, they will be added to the Leaderboard. This information, Spinomenal explains, can be found via the player's toolbar. Additionally, the company confirmed that an overwhelming majority of its popular slot games will participate in the thrilling tournaments that are set to launch on September 28, 2023.</p>
<p>One important feature for all different tournaments is the Super Round. This unique round enables players who participate in the tournaments to significantly increase their scores. During the Super Round, points earned by the players are doubled, granting them a chance for a higher spot within the Leaderboard. What's more, players who progress within each round of each tournament will benefit from 10% of their score which will be "set aside as credit," reveals Spinomenal. To further boost their score, players will see this credit added to their Super Round scores.</p>
