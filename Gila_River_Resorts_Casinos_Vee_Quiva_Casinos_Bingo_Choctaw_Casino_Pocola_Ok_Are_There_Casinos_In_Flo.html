<p>NorthStar Gaming, a Canadian-based gaming operator that is yet to launch operations, unveiled this week the brand under which it will operate online casino and sports betting, NorthStar Bets.</p>
<p>Local Roots and Pride</p>
<p>Originating from a Canadian-based media and trusted news organization with a history spanning back 128 years, NorthStar Gaming is determined to provide a made-in-Ontario casino and sportsbook gaming platform that will offer players a unique local and premier user experience.</p>
<p>“The NorthStar Bets brand pays tribute to our local roots, as a proudly Canadian-owned and operated brand, we take great pride in providing Ontarians with a hyperlocal gaming experience. We hope to inspire a sense of home team pride in our players as they discover our platform and unique NorthStar Bets content.” Michael Moskowitz, CEO and Founding Partner, NorthStar Gaming</p>
<p>The NorthStar Bets brand will also seek to provide timely, relevant and engaging sports betting insights and content to its customers, alongside their favorite games, by utilizing partnerships with reputable and established media players such as Torstar Corporation which was hired to deliver omnichannel advertising and marketing services.</p>
<p>“We’re very excited to work with NorthStar Gaming as they prepare to launch a market-leading online gaming business in Ontario,” said Torstar Corporation interim chief executive officer Lorenzo DeMarchi.</p>
<p>“With Ontario’s regulated online gaming and sports betting market set to open this spring, we’re sure there will be strong interest from our Toronto Star readers, particularly our sports readers, in the growing popularity of wagering content. Now, with the NorthStar Bets integration, readers will have access to gaming related insights and storylines at their fingertips.” Lorenzo DeMarchi, Interim CEO, Torstar Corporation</p>
<p>In turn, the content creation team at NorthStar Bets will deliver sports betting and wagering content to readers of the thestar.com that will be accessible in a dedicated section of the website operated by Torstar.</p>
<p>High-Profile Partnerships</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, NorthStar Gaming signed an exclusive partnership to use targeted video and social content with Canada’s first sports betting content network, Parleh Media Group.</p>
<p>The content network that launched a sports dedicated news and information channel in Toronto in October, Parleh TV Toronto, will collaborate with the company to produce a range of dynamic sports betting-themed videos, podcasts, and social media content.</p>
<p>Also in February, NorthStar Gaming announced a long-term partnership with leading independent provider of premium sports betting and technology services Kambi Group that ensured its soon-to-launch sportsbook will be powered by Kambi’s sports betting solution.</p>
