<p>Casino entertainment company, Caesars Entertainment, announced the launch of its sports wagering mobile app, Caesars Sportsbook, in Kansas.</p>
<p>Kansas Sports Fans Can Now Use Caesars’ Sportsbook App</p>
<p>The company revealed Thursday that it launched its mobile betting app. As a result, sports bettors can now download the app on Android, iOS and desktop devices. Caesars’ sportsbook app is famous for its performance speed but it is also easy to use. Currently, Caesars’ mobile app is the only sportsbook app that offers a customer loyalty program. Sports fans in Kansas can gain access to unique rewards and experiences by accessing Caesars Rewards, the company’s leading customer loyalty program. Wagers placed via the mobile app enable the users to earn Tier Credits as well as Reward Credits. Consequently, the users can redeem those credits in exchange for experiences that include bonus cash within the app, culinary experiences and discounted getaways at select Caesars destinations around the US.</p>
<p>Celebrating the launch of the app, the leading operator announced a special sign-up offer for first-time bettors. To access “The Full Caesar” offer, users need to download the app, register, deposit funds and place their first bet. Upon placing their first bet, those users will receive an additional 1,000 Rewards Credits and 1,000 Tier Credits. What’s more, if the user’s first bet doesn’t win, they receive a one-time free bet that is equal to the amount first wagered by up to $1,250.</p>
<p>The Company Continues Its US Expansion</p>
<p>The recent launch in Kansas reaffirms Caesars’ growing presence in the Midwest. Previously, the company introduced its leading entertainment experiences at popular destinations that included Harrah’s North Kansas City, as well as Harrah’s and Horseshoe Council Bluffs in Iowa and Isle of Capri Hotel Boonville in Missouri. On the other hand, by now, Caesars Sportsbook is live in 26 US states. From that total, in 19 locations the company offers mobile betting services, but it also operates a significant number of land-based sportsbooks around the whole country.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to deliver a world-class sports betting experience that matches the championship pedigree Kansas is known for.” Eric Hession, co-president of Caesars Digital</p>
<p>Eric Hession, Caesars Digital’s co-president, said that the company is excited to launch its leading sportsbook for customers in Kansas. He pointed out that the application is user-friendly but at the same time, offers unique experiences via Caesars Rewards. In conclusion, Hession pointed out that the company is thrilled to launch its sportsbook app in the state just in time for the football season.</p>
