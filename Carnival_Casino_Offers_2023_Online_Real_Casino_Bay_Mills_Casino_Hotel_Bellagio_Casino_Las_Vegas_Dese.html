    <h1>Carnival Casino Offers 2023 Online Real Casino Bay Mills Casino Hotel Bellagio Casino Las Vegas Dese</h1>

<p>Hello Spinx,</p>
<p>I am very sorry, I know gambling addiction is a serious problem and all casinos should approach this issue responsibly. However, I contacted the casino representative and they closed your account as soon as possible, when you asked for self-exclusion. Unfortunately, this self-exclusion doesn't block you from opening accounts with other casinos licensed by Cura√ßao. This authority doesn't provide a self-exclusion option similar to Gamstop.</p>
<p>I apologize I am not able to do more for you under these circumstances, because the casino proceeded correctly and blocked your account. Unfortunately, your deposits can't be returned, as the casino wasn't aware of your problem before you asked the support to close your account. Also all your deposits were played through and in this case there is nothing we can do about it. I can only recommend you to use blocking software, which will prevent you from accessing gambling websites. You can read more about it in this article:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/responsible-gambling#apps-and-tools</p>
<p>Other available softwares are for example:</p>
<p>www.gamblock.com</p>
<p>www.betfilter.com</p>
<p>You can also try to ask your bank to set the limit for transactions. Again, I am really sorry, but we cannot continue resolving this case.</p>
<p>Please, check out the article I am mentioning in this message, you may find many useful information there.</p>
<p>Take care and I hope this will help at least a little bit with your problem.</p>
