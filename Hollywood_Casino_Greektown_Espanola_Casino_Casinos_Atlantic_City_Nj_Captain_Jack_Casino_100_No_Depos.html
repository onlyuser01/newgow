    <h1>Hollywood Casino Greektown Espanola Casino Casinos Atlantic City Nj Captain Jack Casino 100 No Depos</h1>

<p>Developed by Mindspa Health, Gambless is a mental health platform that helps users cope with gambling addiction. Rated as the #1 app for gambling addiction, Gambless has more than half a million users globally.</p>
<p>English Speakers Have Significantly Higher Risk of Problem Gambling</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the platform announced the results of its first-ever annual report. Gambless revealed that it has collected and analyzed data for the last year and compiled the report which includes the responses of 3,500 tests completed by users of the mobile app. The whitepaper analyzed different language groups to determine if one group may be more likely to be impacted by problem gambling. Consequently, the report found that English speakers are 57% more likely to be impacted by problem gambling when compared to Italian speakers.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the Italian speakers were the group that had the lowest score in terms of problem gambling. On the other hand, Russian speakers scored 28% higher than Italians, meaning that they are more likely to experience problem gambling, according to the new report. The ban on gambling advertising that is active in Italy since 2019 is one of the reasons why that group had the lowest score. Additionally, the report said that English speakers may be impacted more because of “aggressive CRM marketing comms” by operators on the UK market.</p>
<p>The Study Shares Unique Insight for Problem Gambling around the World</p>
<p>The study also found that 96% of the users that participated in the test suffered from a form of problem gambling. This does not come as a surprise, considering that the application is mainly focused on treating, preventing gambling harm and helping people who suffer from problem gambling.</p>
<p>But what is worrying is that a significant number of problem gamblers admitted that they accepted various bonuses without reading in full the specific terms and conditions. Gambless found that overall this was observed among 70% of the problem gamblers.</p>
<p>From the total user base that Gambless has, the biggest part of the users, some 25% are from the UK and Ireland. On the other hand, 23% of the users are located in the US and 10% in Australia. Another 15% of the users are based in Italy, 4% in Canada and 3% in Russia. The remaining 20% of Gambless app users live in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Focusing on gambling brands, the study found that Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill, Skybet, Betfair and bet365 were among the most-mentioned brands by UK gamblers. On the other hand, the same list in the US leads with DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM and Bovoda. In Australia, TAB, Aristocrat, Neds as well as Sportsbet are the most mentioned gambling brands.</p>
