<p>While construction of the new casino is still ongoing, Hard Rock unveiled new details regarding the location</p>
<p>In July 2019, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed into law a bill expanding land-based gambling options for the state, granting approval for six new casinos. The international giant and leading gaming and entertainment company, Hard Rock secured a license, allowing it to construct and develop a new Hard Rock Casino Rockford. Consequently, the company opened a temporary casino location in Rockford, while the construction of Hard Rock Casino Rockford started.</p>
<p>Now, as reported by RockRiverCurrent, after securing approval, allowing it to extend its operations through November 9, 2024, from the Illinois Gaming Board on Thursday, the company released renderings, unveiling new details regarding the upcoming Hard Rock Casino Rockford.</p>
<p>The brand-new casino is expected to offer plenty of gambling entertainment options. Such would include six live poker tables, 44 live table games, as well as some 1,300 electronic gaming machines. Fans of sports betting would also have the option to place a wager via the brand-new sportsbook at Hard Rock Casino Rockford.</p>
<p>Opening Expected Late Summer of 2024</p>
<p>Geno Iafrate, Hard Rock Rockford’s president, thanked the gambling regulator in Illinois for their efforts and continuous support for this project. He explained that developing a casino location in Rockford had been a dream for the company for more than two decades.</p>
<p>Iafrate said that the progress on the permanent casino is evident for anyone passing by on I-90, which further helps build the excitement. He explained that Hard Rock Casino Rockford is expected to open its doors in late summer of next year. Finally, Iafrate said: “Hard Rock will deliver on its promise of a premium destination casino that will be well worth the wait.”</p>
<p>“Hard Rock Casino Rockford thanks the Illinois Gaming Board for its continued commitment to work with us in building the casino facility Rockford has dreamed about for more than 20 years.“ Geno Iafrate, president of Hard Rock Rockford</p>
<p>In addition to the gaming floor, the new location is expected to offer plenty of other amenities. Visitors to the permanent casino resort location will be able to enjoy Hard Rock Café, as well as an entertainment venue called Hard Rock Live applicable for multi-use and offering 1,600 seats. Moreover, visitors would be able to enjoy the Plum VIP Lounge, as well as the Council Oak Restaurant.</p>
<p>Being close to I-90 will greatly help with access to the new Hard Rock Casino Rockford. At the same time, guest parking will feature approximately 1,800 spaces, allowing thousands of visitors to enjoy the new casino. Last but not least, judging by the recently released renderings, visitors to Hard Rock Casino Rockford will be greeted by a 90-foot tall checkerboard guitar replica of Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Famer Rick Nielsen, positioned at the front entrance.</p>
