<p>How Does Pulsz Casino Work?</p>
<p>Pulsz Casino is set up as a social gaming website, which gives it a significant pull in the United States for one. The casino uses its own unique social gaming currency, the Gold Coins, which are not real money.</p>
<p>This is precisely why the casino is available in the majority of states as of right now. Social gaming and social casinos are popular and legal, and they provide you with a legit gaming environment to experience your favorite Vegas-style games in a safe and enjoyable setting.</p>
<p>Pulsz Casino Mobile App</p>
<p>Pulsz Casino will make sure that you have the opportunity to play your favorite games on any operating system or device that you want. This is why the casino brings a dedicated Android app that you can use to play at the casino directly through your mobile. If you prefer though, you need not download the Android app.</p>
<p>You can simply use the web browser instead. iPhone and iPad users can also benefit from an iOS app that you can download from the App Store. Just the same, Pulsz Casino is optimized so that its players can get the best experience possible. Once again, should you choose to, you may as well play from your browser without any issues.</p>
<p>Safari and Google Chrome are both great options, although if pressed, we must acknowledge that the apps provide much better overall comfort and are more resilient to random shakes that may flip the view mode.</p>
<p>How to Buy Pulsz Gold Coins</p>
<p>If you want to play at Pulsz Casino, you will first be happy to know that it’s completely free to get started. On-site purchases are voluntary and they most commonly have to do with you purchasing some extra Gold Coin(s) that will help you play a little more. The Gold Coin(s) packs come at various prices and offer free Sweepstakes Coin(s) as a bonus.</p>
<p>For example, you can purchase the 10,000 Gold Coin(s) package for $1.99 or the 785,000 Gold Coin(s) package for $99.99, which is the best way to top up your bankroll if you choose to.</p>
<p>Pulsz Casino also runs many contests and tournaments where you can get some freebies as you go, and the website will also let you enjoy yourself a bit more through random allocations of Gold Coin(s) that you can immediately put to good use.</p>
<p>Is Pulsz Casino Safe?</p>
<p>Pulsz Casino is safe and secure. It operates as a legitimate website that will provide you with all the comforts you expect from a fantastic social gaming experience.</p>
<p>Players are welcome to explore a website that offers advanced SSL encryption, a random number generator (RNG) gameplay introduced by highly-trusted suppliers, and more.</p>
<p>Pulsz Casino is licensed to operate in every state in the United States outside of Idaho and Washington, meaning that you can enjoy your gaming legitimately and without giving it a second thought.</p>
<p>The website uses geofencing to comply with strict gaming laws in the United States, meaning that players from prohibited jurisdictions may not play. Not least, the website makes sure that it’s front and center. This may seem like a minor thing but it’s very important.</p>
<p>On Facebook alone, Pulsz Casino has more than 112,000 followers and they maintain a very strong presence across other social media channels, such as Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. The encryption by the website is 256-bit, which is the current web standard for encrypting data and making sure that your data is safe.</p>
<p>The same level of security and safety applies to the mobile app which will make it very easy for you to enjoy a fulfilling experience no matter what device or medium you choose.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>Customer support at Pulsz Casino is precisely where you expect it to be. The website makes sure to meet and answer your queries with expediency. There is one significant downside with the customer support here – it does not offer live chat, which is a gross omission.</p>
<p>Still, we maintain that Pulsz Casino’s overall customer support is decent. You can get in touch via email (which we recommend) or jump to a Facebook chat – which is also fairly quick, but it’s possible that you could experience a slowdown because the site is processing too many requests.</p>
<p>Pulsz Casino Banking &amp; Payments</p>
<p>Pulsz Casino is all about making the experience convenient for you. Players will see and welcome a variety of banking methods that make it very easy to buy more Gold Coins and get started with the game right away. You will have a range of opportunities to do just that, including:</p>
<p>JCB</p>
<p>Skrill</p>
<p>American Express</p>
<p>MasterCard</p>
<p>Visa</p>
<p>Trustly</p>
<p>The same payment methods will be available to you via the mobile app as well as the desktop website. They all work well and easily. A small drawback here is that Pulsz is a social gaming casino which means that you won’t be able to withdraw any of the money that you actually win in the casino.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other payment options to explore and the casino may change them in the future or based on different states. Overall, Pulsz has a robust payment system that will make it easy for you to top up your account and play your favorite online slots game anywhere in the United States for the most part.</p>
