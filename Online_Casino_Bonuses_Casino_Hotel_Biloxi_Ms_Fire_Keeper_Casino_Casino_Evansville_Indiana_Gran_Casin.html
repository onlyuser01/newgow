<p>Gennady “GGG” Golovkin (42-1-1) is heading into his next fight on Friday, December 18, facing off with Kamil Szeremeta (21-0-0), an undefeated fighter who has 21 wins to his name. Similar to the fight between Canelo and Smith, the pair has stayed away from the ring for more than a year.</p>
<p>Golovkin will now return to defend his middleweight title against Szeremeta who is posted as a heavy underdog (+1100) to win against GGG’s staggering (-2750) advantage. The odds certainly don’t seem to favor Szeremeta who is facing an A-grade opponent who has gone 12 rounds against Canelo Alvarez in 2017 ending in a highly-disputed draw.</p>

<p>Since then, though, Golovkin has defeated Sergiy Derevyanchenko to win the IBF and IBO middleweight belts whereas Szeremeta managed to pull a victory over Oscar Cortes. Fears are that Szeremeta doesn’t have what it takes to stop GGG as their Knockouts (KOs) stand at 5 and 35 respectively.</p>
<p>Golovkin can go the distance and he can knock out an opponent easily. How is Szeremeta going to overcome two distinct advantages?</p>

<p>What are Gennady Golovkin and Kamil Szeremeta odds?</p>
<p>Presently, GGG is favored as a shoo-in by every sportsbook we have checked. Operators post Golovkin as a sure winner, and even after a one-year hiatus from the ring, he is carrying the most backing. Golovkin’s only loss is to Canelo Alvarez by unanimous decision in 2018.</p>
<p>Golovkin has not lost a fight since and he is not likely to start against Szeremeta. Kamil’s age may be a bit of an advantage, he is 31, but this hardly makes a difference against an opponent as well-trained as Gennady.</p>
<p>Kamil seems confident, and he recently said: “I want this title for Poland and my family. GGG is a great champion, one of the best in history, but it is time for a replacement.” Having fought twice as fewer fights, though, Szeremeta will have to find a way to outlast and outscore Golovkin.</p>
