    <h1>Casino Hotels In Albuquerque New Mexico Havasu Landing Resort Casino Casino New York Temecula Casino</h1>

<p>This is a total scam casino. I played over 20k in deposits. I had a balance of about 15k.</p>
<p>I then TRIED to cashout $4k. They did everything in the world to not cash me out. Then they told me I exceeded the $10 rule when I was playing.</p>
<p>I played $5 a spin for days. Only after winning did I raise my bet to 6.25 and then 12.50.</p>
<p>So they said since I exceeded the betting limit they would do me a favor. I'm not lying I can post all emails back and forth. They would do me a favor and wire me $1k and that I forfeited</p>
<p>The rest of the money. This is no joke. This is straight fraud. This is RTG gaming. Nothing but a scam. They did everything for a week to tell me about verifying. I did. They even called my business to verify.</p>
<p>I only wish more people could find this and read it. To know to stay away . The first page of reviews is all paid for reviews,ADS not real reviews.</p>
<p>Please save your money from these cheats.</p>
