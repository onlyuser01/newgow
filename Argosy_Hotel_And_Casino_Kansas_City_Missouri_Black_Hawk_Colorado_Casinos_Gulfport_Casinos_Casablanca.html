    <h1>Argosy Hotel And Casino Kansas City Missouri Black Hawk Colorado Casinos Gulfport Casinos Casablanca</h1>

<p>I use to have an account with Spin Casino which belongs to the Palace group and they operate a few other casinos such as Jackpot City Casino. My account was recently deactivated because I didn't upload my documents in time (i.d.,bank statement). My account can be reactivated once I upload these documents, which isn't a problem for me and will be done when I decide that I feel like having another gamble.</p>
<p>For some unknown reason $108 was taking from my bank account from Bayton, which is where all charges from Spin Casino go too. This $108 was taking about a week after my account was deactivated, so there was no possible way I could have made this deposit and I don't see why I should be charged a fee of this proportion for having my account deactivated. I never won anything, so never got around to uploading my documents to completely verify myself.</p>
<p>I contacted the casino firstly on live chat, but the person I spoke to couldn't assist me, so they gave me the email for their operations department. The operators department seem to like ignoring emails if it has anything too do with money. I suppose they get a lot of emails from problem gamblers trying to get a refund on their losses. This isn't my problem though and i have had an unauthorized charged and don't deserve to be ignored, just because my query has something too do with money. Their response time is 24-48 hours, but it has now been a week and I said a follow up email after 72 hours. Too be honest, I doubt i'll ever hear from them.</p>
