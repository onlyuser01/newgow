<p>Provider of payment solutions Nuvei Corporation announced that it has reached an agreement with 888 Holdings to take charge of payment processing for the Gibraltar-based gambling group’s newly launched SI Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Innovative Payment Services</p>
<p>The agreement between Nuvei Corporation and 888 Holdings will see Nuvei’s Instant Bank Transfer technology power payments for the sportsbook brand launched in partnership with Sports Illustrated as the popular sports magazine is looking to establish a presence in sports betting and iGaming in the US. The payment specialist will provide seamless, real-time bank account funding experience to customers and enable them to make deposits on the sports betting platform via “the most convenient, secure and fast payment method,” something which is “at the core of what Nuvei does,” according to its chair and CEO Philip Fayer.</p>
<p>We are excited to partner with 888 to provide an iconic brand such as Sports Illustrated the ability to launch strong into the U.S. sports betting and iGaming market, improving its player acquisition strategy through our best-in-class user experience, state-of-the-art risk management and instant payments.” Philip Fayer, Chair and CEO, Nuvei Corporation</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement with Nuvei, Head of US at 888, Yaniv Sherman, pointed to the innovative services the payment solutions provider brings to SI Sportsbook to expand its platform’s capabilities. SI Sportsbook also utilizes official sports data and data-driven content provided by Genius Sports, as well as data services from LSports.</p>
<p>With high-growth opportunities across the U.S., it’s important for us to deliver a first-class betting and gaming experience, which includes a diverse suite of payment options. Partnering with Nuvei enables us to enhance the player experience and further the position of SI Sportsbook as a cutting-edge platform in the market.” Yaniv Sherman, SVP, Head of US, 888 Holdings</p>
<p>Seamless Deposits</p>
<p>Nuvei’s platform integration with Plaid, a Dutch-based fin-tech company utilizing the open banking concept, will guarantee players at SI Sportsbook have access to approximately 11,000 financial institutions in the US, while Plaid’s user-initiated bank account verification will add another security layer to Nuvei’s sophisticated risk management checks. Nuvei’s proprietary platform also implements conversion-boosting features and one-click deposits for returning players.</p>
<p>Debuted earlier in the month in Colorado, SI Sportsbook, which features a sports betting platform integrated with sports news, analysis and betting information from Sports Illustrated, is expected to expand into Indiana, Iowa and New Jersey in the coming months. Launches in other US gaming jurisdictions can be expected in the coming years.</p>
