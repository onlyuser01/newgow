<p>The first Derby della Capitale of 2023 is on the program on Sunday, March 19, when SS Lazio welcome AS Roma at Stadio Olimpico in Rome</p>
<p>Lazio is currently in the No. 3 place in the Italian Serie A, but its archrival Roma is just two points behind, sitting in the fifth position. What this means is that if Roma wins, it will overtake Lazio. Let’s see whether it’s going to happen or not.</p>
<p>Lazio vs Roma Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Lazio +163 Draw +200 Roma +179</p>
<p>Goals Over/Under Odds Over 2.5 Goals +163 Under 2.5 Goals -200</p>

<p>Ciro Immobile to Miss the Derby della Capitale</p>
<p>Lazio’s best striker Ciro Immobile will miss Sunday’s game. Actually, last season’s top-scorer will probably miss two weeks at least due to a hamstring injury. This could be a huge problem for the Sky Blues for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, Immobile is their scoring leader with 9 goals in 20 matches in the Serie A this season. Mattia Zaccagni has scored only one goal fewer, but scoring isn’t his main job. Instead, he’s a midfielder who’s meant to help his team establish dominance in the center of the pitch. When it comes to proper strikers, Lazio has no real alternatives to Immobile.</p>
<p>Another reason why his absence could trouble Lazio is that his teammates haven’t been in much of a goal-scoring mood lately. In the two Serie A games they’ve played this month, they failed to score a single goal.</p>
<p>Mourinho to “Park the Bus” on Sunday</p>
<p>In their most recent Serie A game, Jose Mouriho’s boys conceded four goals against Sassuolo at home. You can be 100% certain it didn’t go well with the Portuguese manager, who’s probably spent the last week working on ways to ensure anything similar won’t happen ever.</p>
<p>AS Roma’s strongest weapon is its defense, so what happened in the Sassuolo game? Well, the men from Rome tried to dominate the game and the opponents hit them on the break. That wasn’t the first time that AS Roma conceded a lot of goals to relatively mediocre rivals. On the last day of February, Mourinho’s team lost 2-1 to Cremonese.</p>
<p>This Sunday, AS Roma players will probably let the opposition have the ball. This way, they’ll be able to stay organized at the back and try to keep a clean sheet.</p>
<p>Lazio vs Roma Prediction</p>
<p>Lazio is the host team of the Derby della Capitale, meaning that most of the spectators at Stadio Olimpico will be rooting for the Sky Blues. In such circumstances, Lazio players are likely to push forward, with those playing for Roma defending with all they got.</p>
<p>If Immobile were there, Lazio would be way more dangerous. This way, the hosts don’t look capable of scoring against Roma, at least not too many times.</p>
<p>Pick: Lazio and Roma to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
