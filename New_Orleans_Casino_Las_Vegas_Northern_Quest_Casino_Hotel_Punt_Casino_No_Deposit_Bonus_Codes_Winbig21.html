    <h1>New Orleans Casino Las Vegas Northern Quest Casino Hotel Punt Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Winbig21</h1>

<p>888casino will host games by Playtech, a company that focuses on providing operators with top-level content and iGaming solutions. The partnership will cover multiple states and it comes as part of the two companies’ broader appetites for the North American market, the press release detailed.</p>
<p>Playtech will offer 888casino both of its RNG and Live Dealer games which will be made available to customers in New Jersey as the partners first push together into the US market. Playtech is prepared and willing to provide 888 Holdings with its best iGaming solutions, which 888casino hopes will lead to a stronger pull with local consumers.</p>
<p>New Jersey is one of the most competitive markets in the United States currently, but in terms of iGaming potential, Michigan may actually be catching up and soon surpassing it. This means that the multi-state agreement negotiated by the two partners will most likely soon turn its eye to other lucrative opportunities.</p>
<p>At the same time, executives from the industry have already spoken strongly for the adoption of broader iGaming measures in the United States, something that has lagged behind sports betting legalization but is finally catching up.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new opportunity with 888 Holdings, Playtech COO Shimon Akad said that he was delighted to be expanding with a trusted partner in the US market. "Live Casino is Playtech’s newest proposition to the U.S. market and it is giving operators the opportunity to diversify their offering, resulting in great demand for our industry-leading software," the executive added.</p>
<p>888 US President Howard Mittman did not hesitate to offer compliments to Playtech and its established track record in the creation and deployment of RNG and Live Dealer products. Mittman expressed strong confidence that the new partnership will allow Triple Eights to pursue a much stronger overall content offer in the iGaming vertical and lead to better engagement opportunities for the company.</p>
<p>In the meantime, 888casino has been working on other equally-important partnerships. The company has negotiated a deal for a dedicated live studio with Pragmatic Play. Seeking to strengthen its Live Casino offer, 888casino also negotiated a similar deal with EveryMatrix, a content aggregation platform, to help it add more products to its US offer.</p>
<p>Playtech has also been expanding in North America with most recently the company announcing plans about Ontario, Canada’s iGaming heartbeat. In the US, however, Playtech and 888casino will most likely focus on the Michigan market next.</p>
