    <h1>Tulalip Resort Casino Hotel Cherokee Casino Tahlequah Lake Tahoe Hotels And Casinos Casinos In Tampa</h1>

<p>The GamblingNews podcasts are delivering a wealth of knowledge on various aspects of the gambling industry and one aspect that can never be overlooked is security. We invited Peter Bassill, the founder and CEO of Hedgehog Security, to sit down with us to discuss how the company is helping gaming operators around the world ensure their systems are safe from attacks.</p>
<p>Hedgehog Security is a penetration testing and information security consultancy that has been providing its services for more than 11 years. Bassill launched the company in 2009, but has over 25 years in the information security industry. Hedgehog’s unique approach, which includes the use of white hat hackers, to testing systems and determine where weaknesses might be found has given it a definite advantage over the competition. The company goes deep into the operations and doesn’t just provide a cursory sweep, but explores from every angle to determine if exploits are possible.</p>
<p>The iGaming industry rose quickly over the past couple of years and, as new operators began to introduce online gaming solutions, not all took the necessary precautions to ensure they were protected. Hedgehog is now working diligently with the iGaming industry so operators can protect themselves better and, ultimately, protect their users, as well. It’s a process that deserves constant attention as new threats regularly appear.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges facing cybersecurity companies is a lack of understanding on the part of the customer. Many companies don’t comprehend how information security works and how it can be exploited, which makes it difficult for companies like Hedgehog to provide an adequate level of service. However, Bassill and the rest of the team have been able to counter these limitations and provide data that helps Hedgehog’s customers realize the potential for damage. In doing so, the company is able to thoroughly examine networks and provide solutions that help prevent attacks that could cost companies millions of dollars.</p>
