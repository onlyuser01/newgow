<p>American sports betting and daily fantasy giant DraftKings has named the famous DJ Steve Aoki as a brand ambassador of its DraftKings Marketplace. The Grammy nominee will promote the operator’s brand and its blockchain-based products.</p>
<p>Aoki Will Promote DraftKings’ Blockchain Products</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Aoki will promote DraftKings’ Web3 content. The partnership will focus on the operator’s daily fantasy NFT mix, Reignmakers. The latter is a game where players can collect NFT player cards and participate in various fantasy sports challenges. As someone who is an integral part of modern culture, Aoki will recommend this innovative product to its fans and will emphasize how they combine sports, entertainment and culture.</p>
<p>In celebration of this partnership, DraftKings will release a new Aoki 2022 All-Star Access Pass that provides its owners with special access to private Reignmakers Football contests during the upcoming Football season. During these contests, players can challenge their peers to win rare prizes. The pass is set to launch on September 14 and the contests will continue until the end of the football season. Contest winners may earn exclusive monetary rewards and prizes. The luckiest ones will get to meet Aoki in person. For example, the final week’s contest will reward lucky players with an entry to an Aoki Poker Night event.</p>
<p>DraftKings and Aoki will furthermore work on new NFT collections that feature DraftKings-specific utility. According to the operator’s announcement, customers who purchase these collections may earn additional prizes. The latter range from VIP betting experiences to tickets for Aoki concerts.</p>
<p>The Grammy Nominee Is Happy to Join the DraftKings Family</p>
<p>Matt Kalish, co-founder and president of DraftKings North America, welcomed Aoki to the team. He lauded the two-time Grammy nominee as a globally-recognized star and said that DraftKings is happy to have him on board.</p>
<p>Steve Aoki is globally recognized for his contributions to the music industry and more recently, for his involvement with digital collectibles. I am excited to welcome him to the DraftKings family. Having him on board will provide us with a refreshing perspective for future, community-driven projects, and I look forward to bringing new experiences to our customers and to Steve’s fans. Matt Kalish, president, DraftKings NA</p>
<p>Aoki shared his thoughts on becoming DraftKings’ brand ambassador. He said that he is very happy about the opportunity to work with the company and usher in a new chapter in the history of fantasy sports.</p>
<p>I am excited to be working with DraftKings to build out the next generation of fantasy sports. Through Reignmakers Football, DraftKings customers can have ownership of their rosters in an innovative way that Web3 can provide. Steve Aoki, DJ</p>
<p>DraftKings recently made preparations to launch in the state of Kansas ahead of the National Football League season.</p>
