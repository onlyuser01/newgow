<p>Randy Freer, one of three recently appointed members to the Board of Directors at 888 Holdings, has resigned from his duties with immediate effect, the betting and gaming operator announced.</p>
<p>Outside Commitments behind Resignation</p>
<p>Publishing a short statement to investors, Gibraltar-based gambling group 888 Holdings announced the resignation of Freer from his duties as an Independent Non-Executive Director (NED) at the FTSE250-listed gambling group.</p>
<p>Commenting on Freer’s resignation, 888 Holdings chairman Jon Mendelson thanked him for his contribution during his short time with 888 and wished him well for the future.</p>
<p>Freer was one of the three new NEDs, together with Andrea Gisle Joosen and Andria Vidler, who joined the Board of 888 in July as part of the Board’s expansion to nine members following the acquisition of William Hill and the changes to the team of the UK-based gaming company, but due to his outside commitments, he now stepped down.</p>
<p>Chairman, CEO and Entrepreneur</p>
<p>Freer’s other commitments include his position as chairman of Sinclair Broadcast Group, the media that runs 19 regional sports networks under the Bally Sport brand, formerly owned by Fox, as well as the CEO of his own firm, The Freer Company.</p>
<p>A media and technology expert, Freer set The Freer Company with the idea to provide business vision and brand narrative advice to companies from a wide range of industries.</p>
<p>Before setting up his own advisory business, Freer served as chief executive officer at Hulu, the US subscription streaming service. He joined Hulu from 21st Century Fox where he was in charge of the media’s global entertainment and sports television assets.</p>
<p>“With the highly relevant skills and experience of our recently strengthened board, we continue to see exciting opportunities ahead as we deliver the group’s growth strategy and generate further stakeholder value,” concluded Mendelson.</p>
<p>Earlier in August, the Gibraltar-based online gaming group released its financial results for the first half of the year, posting a double-digit decrease in revenue year-over-year mainly due to the new safer gambling policies in the UK and the closure in the Netherlands.</p>
