<p>TwinSpires‚Äô launch in New Jersey marks the eighth state where the company‚Äôs sportsbook offerings are available, in addition to Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Arizona, which it targeted in August. Furthermore, this will be the third state where its iGaming offerings are available.</p>
<p>To celebrate the occasion of its online gambling products in New Jersey, the betting operator has decided to launch a tempting inaugural promotion in the state, described as the ‚Äúbest-ever sign-up promotion.‚Äù</p>
<p>Passionate sports bettors who register to TwinSpires‚Äô platform right now can earn as much as $1,000 worth of bonus bets. Similarly, iGaming enthusiasts who join the operator at launch are eligible for as much as $500 of risk-free casino play over a 24-hour period.</p>
<p>The Company is Backed by a Team Devoted to Quality</p>
<p>The vice president of marketing at TwinSpires, Sean Phinney, spoke about the launch of the company‚Äôs iGaming and sports betting solutions in the Garden State. He revealed since TwinSpires is the official betting partner of the famous Kentucky Derby, most passionate sports bettors in the state would already have heard the name of the operator.</p>
<p>TwinSpires is backed by the team behind one of the world‚Äôs greatest sporting events, the Kentucky Derby, and as such has a ‚Äúlong history with the greatest two minutes in sports,‚Äù according to Phinney.</p>
<p>The vice president of marketing added that he and the whole TwinSpires team are excited to use their nearly 150 years of wagering history within the United States of America and provide the sports betting and iGaming enthusiasts in New Jersey with their ‚Äústate-of-the-art online sports betting and iGaming products, promotions and offers.‚Äù</p>
<p>Twin Spires is currently owned by Churchill Downs Incorporated, the parent company of Churchill Downs, the popular thoroughbred horse racing racetrack based in Louisville, Kentucky. However, according to the latest hearsays, the parent company is currently considering selling the Twin Spires racing brand in a transaction that can potentially reach as much as $1.5 billion. The latter was reported to Bloomberg by sources who preferred staying anonymous.</p>
