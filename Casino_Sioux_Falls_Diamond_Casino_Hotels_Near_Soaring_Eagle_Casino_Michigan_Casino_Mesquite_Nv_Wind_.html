<p>Stats Perform is already leveraging its data partnership with Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) by sealing a deal with GVC to provide the company with real-time data for in-play tennis markets.</p>
<p>Stats Perform Spearheads In-play Tennis Data for GVC</p>
<p>Sports data specialist and supplier Stats Perform has struck an agreement with GVC Holdings to become the exclusive data provider for the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA). This is the latest in a string of initiative undertaken by GVC to strengthen its portfolio and introduce solutions exclusively focused on ensuring the safety and fairness of sports betting contests.</p>
<p>The agreement extends to a period of six years and is the first deal Stats Perform has sealed since it became the official provider of sports data for the WTA on November 24. As per the agreement, Stats Perform will provide GVC with real-time data from all competitions hosted by WTA in the in-play market vertical.</p>
<p>The deal spans the period between 2021 and 2026 and consolidates both companies’ efforts to raise awareness for their products and expand their portfolio. Commenting on the partnership, Stats Perform chief betting officer Andrew Ashenden noted that his company was delighted to leverage its data expertise and bolster GVC’s offer:</p>
<p>“We’ve long discussed the opportunity with our customers to improve the fan and betting experiences for sports such as tennis through applying our data collection and AI expertise, and are delighted that GVC is aligned with our vision.” -Stats Perform chief betting officer Andrew Ashenden</p>
<p>Providing accurate and actionable data and product is a key tenet within GVC, which recently rebranded as Entain, with a particular focus on legal jurisdictions and dropping a small segment of its portfolio to focus exclusively on these priority markets.</p>
<p>To boost its Advanced Responsibility Care (ARC) program, GVC has kicked off several new initiatives, and brought Dr Mark Griffiths on board to lead consumer protection. Commenting on the most recent tie-up, GVC commercial director Jamie McKittrick said that the WTA tennis tour is one of the most popular events across multiple markets for the company’s consumer base.</p>
<p>Stats Perform Seals New Deal with NZC</p>
<p>While GVC has been busy boosting its product from a consumer and industry standpoint, Stats Perform has been signing more worthwhile partnerships. The company struck a deal with New Zealand Cricket (NZC) allowing it to continue serve as the organization’s go-to data partner for both domestic and international competitions.</p>
<p>Thanks to this renewed partnership, NZC may now integrate data across all of its digital platforms, social media channels and any associated broadcasts. According to NZC’s Alex Rice, the partnership with Stats Perform will allow the organization to boost global engagement opportunities and break down the experience more accessible to the average fan.</p>
