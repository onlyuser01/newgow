<p>The Buffalo Bills vs. Kansas City Chiefs is arguably the biggest game of Week 14 of the 2023 NFL</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are 6-6 in 2023, which isn‚Äôt great, but none of their losses was too disappointing. Meanwhile, the reigning NFL champions, the Kansas City Chiefs are 8-4, but with a couple of crazy losses, one of which happened last weekend when we saw them lose 27-19 to the Green Bay Packers.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bills Hoping for Another Triumph at Arrowhead</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills have a surprisingly good record against the Chiefs at Arrowhead. They won six of their last 10 trips to Kansas City, with two of their losses happening after overtime. The last time they played there, they beat the Chiefs 24-20.</p>
<p>Can they do something similar again? The Bills vs. Chiefs odds aren‚Äôt in their favor, but they‚Äôre not too long actually, suggesting that they do stand a chance to win on Sunday. They‚Äôre currently seen as three-point underdogs, which may surprise you given that their recent run isn‚Äôt too impressive.</p>

<p>The Bills are 1-3 in their last four games, with their only win being a 32-6 blowout win over the New York Jets. When it comes to their losses, they all happened against respectable opponents ‚Äì the Philadelphia Eagles, Denver Broncos, and Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
<p>Plus, two of those losses happened by no more than a field goal. One of those is the defeat to the Eagles in Buffalo‚Äôs most recent game (on November 26), which saw them lose 37-34 after overtime. After that game, they had a bye, meaning that they‚Äôd had one extra week to prepare for the clash with last season‚Äôs Lombardi Trophy winners.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs Looking to Bounce Back After a Surprising Loss</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Chiefs lost to the Green Bay Packers 27-19 on the road. They had a chance to equal the score late in the game, but Patrick Mahomes‚Äô Hail Mary pass did not reach its destination.</p>
<p>It wouldn‚Äôt save the day for the Chiefs, but this way, it‚Äôs fair to say that Mahomes did not have a good evening. He threw 21-for-33 for 210 yards, recording one TD pass and one interception. His passer rating for that game was 79.1, which is his fifth-worst passing performance of 2023.</p>
<p>The reason why this should worry him and the Chiefs‚Äô offense is that in Week 14, they‚Äôre taking on one of the NFL‚Äôs best defenses. If they‚Äôre going to win, Mahomes needs to up his game.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills vs. Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>The Bills are good defensively, but Mahomes is the best QB in the league and he should be able to find a way to outsmart them.</p>
<p>This goes especially given that he‚Äôs been getting some criticism for not being too efficient lately. He can shush his critics with a passing masterclass in the Buffalo Bills vs. Kansas City Chiefs Week 14 game.</p>
<p>Pick: Kansas City Chiefs -2.5 (-115)</p>
