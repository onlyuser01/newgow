    <h1>Hollywood Casino Maryland Heights Casino In Mississippi Biloxi Vegas X Org Casino Casino Buffet Near</h1>

<p>Hi. I signed up to this casino and was told verification wasn't necessary. I was lucky enough to win $3750 and found I could only withdraw $750 a day. My first withdrawal of $750 was processed and received into my crypto wallet in around 4 hours, great. This is where things changed.</p>
<p>I submitted my second withdrawal on 30 May 23. 24 hours later I was now told I need to verify my account. I submitted my documents immediately and they took 2 days to process with lots of issues with some of it as they were asking for impossible documents on my crypto account.</p>
<p>On 02 Jun 23 my account was now fully verified.</p>
<p>A few hours later I received an email that my withdrawal was rejected as my wallet address was incorrect. This is impossible as I use the same crypto wallet for every withdrawal and it was the exact same wallet address that just 3 days earlier they used to pay my first withdrawal which I recieved, no problems. This all convenientely for them, happens just before a weekend that I was also advised that they do not process withdrawals on.</p>
<p>I have sent numerous emails asking why they cancelled my withdrawal and they are now not replying at all.</p>
<p>This is a blatant attempt to delay my withdrawals.</p>
<p>It has now been 5 days since I tried to make my first withdrawal and still nothing. How can they tell me my own crypto wallet address is incorrect when It is copied and pasted from my own wallet.</p>
<p>Here is the email I received.</p>
