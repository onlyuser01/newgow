    <h1>Gilpin Casino Casino Elk Grove Coeur D Alene Casino Seneca Allegany Casino Hotel Santa Ana Casino Ho</h1>

<p>The companies have teamed up for a new, improved and web3-powered social poker experience that is due in June</p>
<p>The new game, PokerGO Play, will bring the best of both worlds, with PokerGO one of the world’s leading online poker companies and Gala Games an established heavyweight in the development of social and web3 experiences.</p>
<p>New Social Experience to Bring Poker to Players</p>
<p>Thanks to PokerGO Play, players will have access to a state-of-the-art poker platform which will focus on revolutionizing the social experience for participants, giving poker aficionados worldwide a brand new way to experience and enjoy the game.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on with the game, including great overall functionality and ground-breaking gameplay. Players will similarly have the opportunity to redeem exclusive real-world prizes, adding even more incentives to try out this promising upcoming platform. PokerGO is already working hard on the marketing angle.</p>
<p>The platform will see Maria Ho, a famed female poker player, serve as the official ambassador for PokerGO Play and help raise awareness for the product, its capabilities and why poker aficionados may end up enjoying it a lot. Ho will also be featured as one of the avatars in the game, along with many other famous poker figures and personalities.</p>
<p>Giving Poker Fans a New Way to Engage with Poker</p>
<p>PokerGO Revenue Officer Richard Blankenship welcomed the arrival of this new platform, and teased what it would be bringing around for players:</p>
<p>PokerGO’s extensive experience in poker entertainment combined with the cutting-edge Web3 development at Gala Games is a perfect marriage. Together, we have been able to build a superior social poker game that players everywhere will love. PokerGO Revenue Officer Richard Blankenship</p>
<p>The news was similarly hailed by Gala Games founder Eric Schiermeyer who was just as excited to see this new partnership between the companies take shape and an official release date pinned on the calendar.</p>
<p>PokerGO’s leadership position in poker paired with Gala Games’ expertise in the social and web3 verticals have allowed the companies to craft a social poker game that is unlike anything seen today, Schiermeyer said. Gala Games and PokerGO will also work on special events broadcast from PokerGO’s dedicated studio in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
