<p>“We are constantly trying to improve our value proposal, adding suppliers and technologies that allow us to be at the forefront of the market,” stated Wilfred Adelsdorfer, chief executive officer at Latamwin, noting that “the incorporation of Vibra Gaming implies extending this process of innovation” bringing new and relevant games to the fore while maintaining our demand in terms of quality and security standards, which is a priority for both companies.”</p>
