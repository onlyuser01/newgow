    <h1>Closest Casino To Nashville Tn Muckleshoot Casino Resort Auburn Way South Auburn Wa Pala Casino 400</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>kindly note that we can't just change the casino rating every time any player post any accusations, but we always care to inspect every proof players can provide us with to make sure that the rating is accurate. I'm not defending the casino, I asked you to send us proofs we can go through. Can you do that, please?</p>
<p>"Well, we take such information very seriously - if you can prove all that you stated, kindly do so. Preferably by using this email: data@casino.guru. We will change the rating accordingly, if necessary, that's what we do also with complaints. Unfair casinos are awarded black points, this can affect the rating based on the severity of the issue.</p>
<p>Kindly understand that we can't do that without solid proof, so we appreciate every cooperation with players. üëç"</p>
<p>Your complaint is running, if Nick finds that the casino acted unfairly that he will decide the outcome.</p>
<p>Read more about the consequences here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the user review rating is separated from the casino's ratings simply because we can't investigate every review and make sure that provided pieces of information are true - as we can do with complaints, for instance.</p>
<p>Does it sound better to you, now? üôÇ</p>
