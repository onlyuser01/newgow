<p>Yggdrasil has signed a partnership deal with Planetwin365, a flagship brand under the Austria-based SKS365, to boost its presence in the Italian market. Yggdrasil launched in Italy in 2017. Now, it has live games with several operators. With its newest collaboration, the company will gain even more player attention in the country.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil, chief of global market operations, Björn Krantz, stated that the company had successfully established itself in the Italian market, and the new collaboration is a confirmation of its strengthening local presence. He said that thanks to Planetwin365, Yggdrasil would reach even more players, providing more entertaining, immersive content offerings.</p>

<p>Under the agreement, Yggdrasil’s gaming content will go live with Planetwin365, one of the leading sports betting brands in the country. With this integration, Planetwin365 users will gain access to 24 games initially from Yggdrasil’s portfolio and 15 titles soon to come.</p>
<p>Among Yggdrasil’s 24 available games are hits like Golden Fishtank, Easter Island, Vikings go Wild, and All Star Knockout – a third-party game from YG Masters program.</p>
<p>SKS365 chief commercial officer Troy Cox stated that the company is happy to start releasing Yggdrasil’s content to its customers in Italy. He said that the provider offers high-quality content, which contributes to its popularity among the Italian audience.</p>
<p>Cox concluded that launching Yggdrasil’s content on the company’s website is an exceptional addition to their brand’s portfolio with the provider’s offering of a rich, immersive, and entertaining gaming experience.</p>

Inspired by Norse Mythology, Thor Infinity Reels allows players to explore a battle-scorched world packed with big winning opportunities. With this slot game, players would meet some of the most iconic Norse Mythology heroes and uncover divine fortunes.
