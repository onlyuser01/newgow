    <h1>Rio Casino Las Vegas Reviews Wynn Casino Poker Tournament Talking Sticks Casino Belterra Casino Reso</h1>

<p>I'll explain everything in detail. On April 25th, they sent me a loyal reward with the code PLUS75 which I played and finished my playthrough. I was able to withdraw at the cashier section on April 26th and even got the confirmation that it's been requested. Got the email for confirmation and I replied back. Then I got an email saying it's been declined because I needed account verification. Mind you, I requested and ask for verification before I usually start playing and was told that verification isn't mandatory when I'm playing crypto which is what I used to deposit prior to my loyalty reward. Anywho, my cashout was declined and had to send verification again with my DL and photo holding my DL...the agents I'm chatting was giving me different information where to send my documents..first they said to send it to banking@casinobrango.com then the other ones said to documents@casinobrango.com... Just to be safe, I send it to both. Took a days to be fully verified and got my payout after that on April 27th. Then yesterday, April 28th, when I logged in, I saw that I had another free spins on Cash Bandits 3 so I'm like hey, why not...played it. Won $18+ something and went ahead and played Jungle wheel and Mighty drums and I'm just trying to finish my playthrough and lost and I ended up with around .27 cents... I left the game and check balance and it says Real balance is .27.. playthrough balance is 0. I was thinking where can I play.27 cents so i went ahead to tarot destiny and kept playing until I won $55. And I'm like... I'll withdraw $50 and leave $5 to play later...well, they declined the $50 saying I can only withdraw once from a code which I thought the last cents I had wasn't even part of the promo anymore as it says my playthrough balance was already 0 before i played Tarot destiny. They voided my withdrawal, took the $50 out of my account and even took the $5 i left for my account and left me with $0 balance.</p>
