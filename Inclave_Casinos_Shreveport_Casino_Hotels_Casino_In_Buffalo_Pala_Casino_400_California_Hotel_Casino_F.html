<p>SBOTOP will serve as the front-of-shirt sponsor of the club’s Men’s First Team</p>
<p>Fulham Football Club, a professional English soccer club, has unveiled a monumental deal with the global betting brand SBOTOP. This is a record shirt sponsorship deal for the operator, whose logo will appear on the front of the jerseys of Fulham FC players.</p>
<p>The gambling brand will serve as the principal partner of the club throughout the 2023/24 season. Its logo will appear on the uniforms of the Men’s First Team and will also be visible on the sleeves of the team’s training kit.</p>
<p>The official kit launch is on June 30. However, soccer fans will first see these new kits in-game during the pre-season when Fulham FC takes to the pitch in America as a part of the Premier League Summer Series.</p>
<p>The strategic front-of-shirt position will greatly enhance SBOTOP’s visibility, helping it popularize its brand and improve its presence. In addition to appearing on the players’ jerseys, the operator’s logo will also appear at their home stadium, further promoting the gambling company.</p>
<p>As a global online gambling operator, SBOTOP recognizes the importance of exposure through partnerships with notable sports teams. While front-of-shirt gambling sponsorships remain a controversial topic in the United Kingdom and may be moved to the sleeve, the current deal will still benefit the operator.</p>
<p>The Deal Is an Important Source of Revenue for the Team</p>
<p>Bill Mummery, SBOTOP’s chief executive officer, commented on the new partnership, saying that his team is “delighted and excited” to promote its brands through the partnership with Fulham FC. He said that he hopes Fulham FC’s trip to the US will be productive and enjoyable.</p>
<p>We are delighted and excited to bring our two ‘Premier Brands’ together. Jointly, we look forward to increasing both our brands’ awareness on a truly global platform in the coming seasons. I wish Fulham an enjoyable and rewarding trip to the USA. Bill Mummery, CEO, SBOTOP</p>
<p>Jon Don-Carolis, Fulham FC’s commercial director, also commented on the deal, saying that the club is pleased to welcome SBOTOP as its front-of-shirt partner. He also noted that such sponsorship deals are an important source of revenue for the club.</p>
<p>The coveted front-of-shirt sponsorship plays an integral part in keeping the Club competitive through significant revenue, and we look forward to celebrating continued success in 2023/24. Jon Don-Carolis, commercial director, Fulham FC</p>
<p>Recently, Aston Villa faced criticism over its sponsorship agreement with BK8 as discontentment against gambling in the UK grows. In other news, Betsson recently became the front-of-shirt sponsor of the Boca Juniors, a popular Argentine sports club.</p>
