    <h1>Northern Quest Casino Jai Alai Casino Royalton Antigua An Autograph Collection All Inclusive Resort</h1>

<p>Dear Mohammed,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.onecasino.com/termsandconditions:</p>
<p>„The User agrees to indemnify One Casino and hold One Casino harmless from any claim, demand, damage, or loss including reasonable attorneys’ fees, asserted by any third party due to or arising out of the use of User of the Website or use by any third party accessing the Website using the account of User."</p>
<p>"One Casino is not required to keep a list with the names of Users and their passwords. If the User forgets, loses or for any other reason is unable to log-in to the system, or if the User gives, shares, allows or enables in any direct or indirect way others to use their access code and password, One Casino shall not be responsible and liable for any claim resulting therefrom."</p>
<p>"The registration and the Account of User and all his permitted use of the Website is strictly personal and non-transferrable. It is strictly forbidden to provide the personal account information, such as, but not limited to, usernames and passwords, to third parties, or use this kind of information from third parties. The User is solely responsible and liable for any use, misuse and/or abuse of his registration, the Account and all permitted use of the Website."</p>
<p>The only thing that I would strongly recommend to you is avoiding this kind of action in the future. It is absolutely forbidden to grant an access to your account to a third party, along with the third party uploading their personal documents.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
