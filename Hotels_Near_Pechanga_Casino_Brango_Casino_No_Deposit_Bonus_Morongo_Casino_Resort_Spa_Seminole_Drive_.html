<p>Rivalry Corp. continues to build a diverse gambling portfolio and product that is focused on appealing to Millenials and Gen Z audiences. After launching as a native esports betting brand, the company has now been progressing to other areas of the experience, including online casino, through the company’s Casino.exe product, which has now been bolstered by Rivalry’s new, custom, and homebrewed brand of slot games.</p>
<p>Rivalry CEO and Co-founder StevenSalz has spoken about the latest expansion for the company, noting that it has been focusing heavily on growing its portfolio and bringing fresh opportunities for players.</p>
<p>"Slots are far-and-away one of the most popular online casino genres and will markedly complement our existing iGaming offering in terms of both betting handle and player satisfaction," Salz said, commenting on this fresh opportunity.</p>
<p>Although Rivalry entered the online casino vertical recently, it has already been innovating it rapidly through its Casino.exe platform, promising to bring ever-fresher games and experiences. This comes at a time when other native esports betting brands have decided to fold rather than expand.</p>
<p>Both Luckbox and Unikrn said that they would discontinue their B2C offers, and focus more so on B2B. Rivalry, though, has been pushing firmly into its business-to-customer offering, albeit the company has been prescient enough to embrace an early branching out to other lucrative segments, such as traditional sports betting and of course, iGaming.</p>
<p>The Rivalry Slots that are now available at Casino.exe have a retro and arcade feel in them, and the dedicated slot page also has Easter eggs for players to discover and rave about, done in true Rivalry style which focuses on prioritizing and engaging with its players. This was welcomed by David King, who is the Director of Product Design at the company.</p>
<p>"Our product philosophy is at its core about creating fundamentally entertaining experiences," King stated briefly. King spoke about the way that Rivalry wanted to bring nostalgia into things and make its custom brand of slots immediately stand out from what else is available to the market.</p>
<p>It may seem counter-intuitive at first blush, but this emotional connection that Gen Z and Millenials may have to the early-2000s of the Internet age is what has given Rivalry a very strong foothold in this new and interesting category, the company believes.</p>
