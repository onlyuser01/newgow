<p>Burnley Is Back in the Prem</p>
<p>We think there’s no chance Burnley can beat Manchester City. After all, the Clarets haven’t done it in a long time. In fact, they’re without a single win over the Cityzens in the Pep Guardiola era. Since the Spaniard took over as the Man City coach in 2016, Burnley has lost 15 games to his team and drew only once.</p>
<p>The tie in question happened in 2018, and since, Manchester City has won 11 times against Burnley, scoring 40 goals along the way, and allowing just one. Actually, Burnley’s failed to find the net against this opponent in each of their last seven duels in all competitions.</p>
<p>All this means that Burnley’s fans shouldn’t hope for much on Friday, but there’s one thing that’s making them optimistic about not getting hammered by the champions. Their 2023-24 squad looks pretty decent, while they also have a good coach this year – former Man City defender Vincent Kompany.</p>
<p>Manchester City to Start Title Defense in Top Gear</p>
<p>In their most recent game, the Cityzens lost to Arsenal in the Community Shield. After 1-1 in the regular 90 minutes, the game went to penalties where the Gunners did better. Pep Guardiola and his men probably wish they’d done better, but their main goal right now is the EPL title defense. They want to start the season in top gear.</p>
<p>Luckily for the champions, they have a fantastic roster. Pretty much all of their key players from the treble-winning season are still there, while there are a few new faces in the locker room. Croatian midfielder Mateo Kovacic moved to Man City from Chelsea, while his compatriot, defender Josko Gvardiol arrived from RB Leipzig.</p>
<p>Burnley vs. Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>Manchester City is the best team on the planet in the 2023-34 season. The Cityzens look capable of beating any opponent in the world, so beating Burnley shouldn’t be that difficult. Plus, they just love playing against the Clarets, which is why it’s only natural to assume they’re going to win big once again.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
