    <h1>Seneca Niagara Resort Casino Pokerstars Casino Bonus Code The Pass Casino Bally S Quad Cities Casino</h1>

<p>Hey Nick,</p>
<p>My account got closed on 20th of April, I provided all documents they asked for, I'm pretty sure my account got verified before they closed it. I've made payments by crypto, but I always send transaction confirmation if casino needs it. Sadly, I cannot confirm what documents they asked me to send because everything was done on their website, including support contact and verification, and I have no access to the account anymore (it is blocked). Obviously, I used my personal information and documents to register on their website. I've never had an issue like this with other casinos and I use the same personal information and documents everywhere.</p>
<p>I think I made 100 eur deposit (again, I cannot confirm 100% because it was a crypto transaction and their casino doesn't send emails confirming the payment) and my bet limit was 40 eur from the start. I thought that's because I got limited on mystake casino which is their service as well. I played with pretty high win rate and when I got to around 300 eur, I requested to withdraw half of my fund and played for the rest. While I was dealing with verification proccess, I was still playing and when I got to around 650 eur on the account and 150 eur in the withdrawal request, my account got blocked.</p>
<p>The numbers might not be 100% accurate (max 50-100eur margin of error), because have no access to account to check it in details. Sorry if I went a bit offtopic, I wanted to describe the situation the best I could.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions feel free to ask. It's pretty hard to rely only on my memory, the casino doesn't send any emails regarding payments, requests and verification, but I'm trying my best to present you the situation the most accurately I can.</p>
