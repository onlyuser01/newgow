    <h1>Bally S Dover Casino Resort Big Dollar Casino No Deposit Bonus Grand Rapids Casino Seneca Casino Nia</h1>

<p>Provider of payment solutions for the gaming industry Sightline Payments announced it entered into an exclusive partnership deal with Marker Trax to boost the Play+ app with a credit option.</p>
<p>Responsible Credit Option Gaming</p>
<p>Available for legal, regulated sports betting and iGaming markets, the Play+ mobile app will utilize Play+ Markers to allow players to fund their gaming account in a responsible way via Marker Trax patented credit tool, starting from September 2021, the kickoff of the 2021 National Football League (NFL) season.</p>
<p>“The key to drawing consumers into the legal, regulated sports betting market is offering them the same conveniences that, until now, were not available to anyone in a legal setting. This new partnership with Marker Trax will enable Sightline to offer credit wagering options in the legal, regulated market for the first time.” Joe Pappano, CEO, Sightline Payments</p>
<p>Developed in 2018, the Marker Trax system allows players to establish a credit line and access the funds directly at a slot machine with their rewards card. Using real-time data, Play+ Markers will facilitate the process of a credit line extension for online gaming operators.</p>
<p>“The illegal sports betting market brings in $150 billion annually, mostly fueled by unregulated credit. The Sightline-Marker Trax partnership will arm licensed U.S. operators with regulated credit offerings to finally compete on a level playing field.” Charlie Skinner, COO, Marker Trax</p>
<p>Utilizing advanced analytics into players’ gaming behavior, the tool allows operators to establish appropriate credit limits, ranging from $100 to the maximum allowed in each gaming jurisdiction, to protect their customers from overspending.</p>
<p>“Play+’s built-in responsible gaming safeguards will ensure that consumers are able to wager in a safe manner, including special features that help them control how much they spend and how long they play.” Joe Pappano, CEO, Sightline Payments</p>
<p>Players in jurisdictions that allow using credit funding for gaming purposes who choose to wager via Play+ Markers will have at their disposal the same responsible gaming tools such as time limits, profit/loss statements, resources to address excessive spending, and others. These are currently available with more than 70 partners of Sightline Payments which offer the Play+ mobile app.</p>
<p>Cashless Payments for Land-Based Casino Operators</p>
<p>Sightline Payments is also at the core of another gaming industry initiative, looking to spearhead efforts of land-based casino operators to go cashless.</p>
<p>In January, Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming and Australian slot supplier Aristocrat Technologies teamed with the payment provider to take advantage of its expertise through their transition to touchless payment options.</p>
<p>Resorts World Las Vegas, the $4.3 billion casino resort on the Las Vegas strip which opened doors earlier in the month, also utilizes cashless payment options via a partnership with Sightline Payments.</p>
<p>Currently, Marker Trax is fully integrated into Konami’s Money Klip app, but the company has ambitious plans to expand into other casino management systems by the end of the year.</p>
