    <h1>Florence Casino Mohegan Sun Casino Online Jackpot Junction Casino Treasure Island Ti Hotel Casino Mg</h1>

<p>When dealing with the agents as slots of Vegas situations ridiculous. At one point in one day I spoke with four different agents each one gave me a different answer for my situation. I won 2300 bucks and was pretty excited about it until I started talking with the agents. First of all he told me it would take 7 days for me to get the approval to get my winnings and then another 10 to 7 days for them to dispatch the payment. I waited 7 days but still no approval from the casino. I talked with the agent she told me that everything was perfect and to give it a couple more days. Few days past I spoke with another agent they told me that I was missing some documents. So I feel the documents out and they got approved. Then I spoke with another agent who said that casino did not under my bank because they could not wire the money to the bank which is a military Bank. Then agent told me to do it the second way and that it would be fast and all my information had turned in was accurate. I had a problem with that because when I tried to withdraw the money that way they said that I had valid some agreement which was not true so another agent corrected that and told me to draw the money again but she never fixed the issue. Then another agent told me to do a Bitcoin and it'll take five days to get it through Bitcoin I called and the fifth day or text and another agent told me it would take 7 to 10 days to bitcoin. So then I decided that I would take a little bit money out to start playing some more and this is when everything changed. The machines that I had won the money on and now began to malfunction every time I played. The machine would slow down very slowly I'll go really really fast not stopping for about 3 minutes at times. I'm not making any of this up I have proof of all of it anyone would love to have it or definitely give it to you so you can get your money from slots of Vegas who are not a trustworthy honest organization. Oh l before I forget One agent got so upset because the question I don't answer she told me I should be cautious on how I talked to her and what I say basically saying that she was threatening me I promise I did not make that part of either.</p>
