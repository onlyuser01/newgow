<p>GAMOMAT, a German-based online slot games developer, has reinforced its team with the addition of Andreas Kaufmann. The latter is an experienced gaming industry veteran who will serve as the managing director of GAMOMAT Distribution.</p>

<p>Kaufmann is an experienced entrepreneur and gaming industry worker. He has worked for various gaming operators and suppliers and has years of experience in executive positions. As a result, the new appointee has just the right skill set that GAMOMAT needs.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the German developer, Kaufmann worked for various companies in the sector. His experience includes a position as the chief executive officer of an online casino group. Furthermore, Kaufmann has crucial experience as an entrepreneur and is familiar with Europe’s finance sector.</p>
<p>As managing director of GAMOMAT Distribution, Kaufmann will work to boost the company’s growth. He will be responsible for overseeing the brand’s expansion in many important regulated markets and helping its content reach more operators and customers.</p>
<p>Moreover, Kaufmann will be responsible for GAMOMAT’s rich portfolio of partnerships. The new appointee will have the important task of maintaining the company’s existing partnerships and helping it ink new agreements.</p>
<p>The New Appointee Is Excited to Get Started</p>
<p>Kaufmann spoke about his new position and said that he feels proud to join GAMOMAT Distribution. The new managing director added that he is looking forward to teaming up with the rest of GAMOMAT’s talented team and working to expand the company.</p>
<p>It’s a proud moment to join GAMOMAT Distribution’s outstanding team to help accelerate the company’s growth in key regulated markets. My responsibility will be expanding the reach of GAMOMAT’s exceptional games portfolio across the gaming landscape. Andreas Kaufmann, MD, GAMOMAT Distribution</p>
<p>Dietmar Hermjohannes, GAMOMAT’s founder, welcomed Kaufmann to the company. He explained that the addition of Kaufmann as managing director will help the company boost its growth. Hermjohannes noted that Kaufmann’s experience in the industry made him the perfect man for the job.</p>
<p>The business is excellently positioned to continue building on its impressive growth and Andi’s appointment adds further momentum to our strategic goals. Andi’s operator and supplier side experience will play a vital role in realizing GAMOMAT’s vision. Dietmar Hermjohannes, founder, GAMOMAT</p>
<p>The appointment of Kaufmann as managing director marks yet another great addition to GAMOMAT’s team. In early March, the company named Dimitry Völkle as head of partnerships. As a company with more than a hundred games available in dozens of markets, the developer recognizes the need for talented workers.</p>
