<p>Horse racing, online wagering, and gaming operator Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) announced in a media release today a shift towards a single brand strategy regarding its online wagering segment is underway, rebranding its sportsbook and iGaming platform to TwinSpires.</p>
<p>Michigan to Initiate the Brand Transition</p>
<p>Currently, CDI operates under the BetAmerica brand and the process of brand transition will begin with its launch in Michigan later this month. In September, CDI opened its BetAmerica Sportsbook at the Island Resort &amp; Casino in Harris, and stated its intent to add online sports betting and iGaming in the near future.</p>
<p>“Pursuing a single brand strategy allows us to maintain focus on integrating our horse racing wagering platform alongside our sports betting and iGaming business, which will provide our players with the ultimate online and mobile betting experience.” Ian Williams, President, Online Gaming, CDI</p>
<p>In December, the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) approved a provisional license for the company, along with 14 others, to partner commercial and tribal casinos for online gaming and sports betting offerings, with launch pending on independent testing of platforms and games and the regulator’s approval of operators’ internal controls.</p>
<p>TwinSpires Widely Recognized</p>
<p>CDI noted the transition for retail and online sportsbooks in Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Pennsylvania from BetAmerica to the TwinSpires brand, which has been utilized for pari-mutuel wagering since 2007, would complete during the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>“Our TwinSpires brand has consistently delivered over 13 years and is associated with more than a century of wagering experience. That history and heritage offers a unique point of difference in a competitive space.” Bill Mudd, President and Chief Operating Officer, CDI</p>
<p>Providing access to premier horse racing content from around the world, including the famous Kentucky Derby, TwinSpires is widely recognized within the online betting market, a popularity CDI would look to utilize for its sports betting and iGaming offerings.</p>
<p>“We remain focused on building a profitable sports betting and iGaming business that provides our customers with an integrated experience alongside our horse racing wagering platform. The transition to TwinSpires not only generates marketing efficiencies, but also allows us to deliver a more complete overall experience to our growing online wagering customer base.” Bill Mudd, President and Chief Operating Officer, CDI</p>
<p>The TwinSpires horse racing brand will continue to provide to its players the same internally-developed technology platform for wagering on horse racing, alongside already known high levels of customer service, while the new sports betting and iGaming offerings will utilize a new technology platform powered by GAN and Kambi Group.</p>
