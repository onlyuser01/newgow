    <h1>Angel Of The Wind Casino Resorts Casino Nj Three Rivers Casino Cashman Casino Las Vegas Slots Atlant</h1>

<p>The recently released details come ahead of the much-anticipated launch of the collaboration between the duo</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the popularity of loyalty programs offered by casino and entertainment operators has grown exponentially. It’s no surprise that leading operators on the Las Vegas Strip have identified the potential of loyalty programs and launched their own versions, offering benefits for their return and loyal clients. MGM Resorts International, the globally recognizable gaming and entertainment company, currently offers MGM Rewards, a loyalty program that allows its members to earn points and exchange them for different perks and incentives.</p>
<p>Last year in July, MGM unveiled details regarding a new extraordinary experience its members will benefit from in collaboration with Marriott International. Labeled as the MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, the collaboration is expected to deliver world-class benefits and incentives for guests of the two leading brands. Ahead of the debut of the MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, expected “by early 2024,” MGM released details regarding the exceptional experiences for its guests.</p>
<p>According to the company, a number of resorts would be “headlining the MGM Collection.” MGM said that “four properties will also add their distinctive personalities to Marriott Bonvoy’s brand portfolio,” with the list including four leading casino and casino locations in Las Vegas. Those are the Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, ARIA Resort and Casino, as well as Park MGM Las Vegas.</p>
<p>MGM Rewards Members to Be Eligible for Marriott Bonvoy Status</p>
<p>Besides the resorts that will be headlining the MGM Collection, the company released details regarding the potential conversion of MGM Rewards members eligible for status with Marriot Bonvoy. The leading gaming and entertainment company revealed that its MGM Rewards Gold members will be able to enroll with Marriot Bonvoy, becoming Marriot Bonvoy Silver Elite. On the other hand, MGM Rewards Platinum members will qualify for a Marriot Bonvoy Gold Elite status while MGM Rewards NOIR members would be eligible for Marriot Bonvoy Ambassador Elite status.</p>
<p>“Marriott Bonvoy and MGM Rewards will unlock significant benefits and experiences for members of both programs,“ reads a statement released by MGM Resorts International</p>
<p>MGM explained that thanks to Marriot Bonvoy and MGM Rewards, members of the two programs will be able to access thrilling experiences and benefits. The recent details come in anticipation of the launch of the collaboration between the two globally recognizable brands.</p>
