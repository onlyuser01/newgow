    <h1>Mandalay Bay Resort Casino Old Havana Casino El Cortez Hotel And Casino Newest No Deposit Codes For</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>it's great that you find us. I think it's good to know the casino, so can you name it, please? I'd like to check its reputation and complaints to get some basic insight.</p>
<p>In general, I can say that account verification may occur more than once, it just depends on the casino's approach. Always try to cooperate and give the casino some time to process it. We, for instance, allow casinos 14 full days to check the account and send the winnings to the player.</p>
<p>This KYC can take even a week in necessary so I would not say that 2 days is a disaster at this point.</p>
<p>The employees just need some time to go through all documents and probably compare these with the ones from the previous verification, it takes time. Some casinos allow players to see which documents are already accepted and which are not, sadly, it's not a common standard, but you can try to ask the live chat about it.</p>
<p>Kindly let me know the name ðŸ™‚.</p>
