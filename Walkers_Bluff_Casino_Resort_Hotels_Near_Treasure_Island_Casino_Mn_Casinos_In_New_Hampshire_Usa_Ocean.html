    <h1>Walkers Bluff Casino Resort Hotels Near Treasure Island Casino Mn Casinos In New Hampshire Usa Ocean</h1>

<p>I won't R1300 and the max payout was R1500 so I said no point playing more if reached the limit and irrespective of what I do I have reached the max payout. So I submitted docs for verification and was told to wait as the process needs to run its course. In the mean time I can play on the Practise mode and expetiance and test games I never play... No money involved its play purposes only... So I started playing tables and the slots and it was great because every new game you receive R1000 dummy test money... But for some or other reason during the Practise session the system moved to my real money without informing or warning me..... So when I saw it I though it can't be difficult to justify and correct as logically I could not gain anything and looking at the history they can see I'm in Practise mode and then also why would you play own money if you reached your max.... They told me I need to be more cautious and it's my mistake.... The supervisor Charlene had the people skills of a rubber oor mat as they just could not see hoe reddiculous and unfair this was as I still waiting for them to verify my account... I even took screen shots where I was assure its savebut like I told them it's not the a out R1300 you play out in 20min....its the princepal and the way it was done.... Guys Springbok unfortunately runs on SA morals..... Bad service, don't care attitude, any excuse not to pay and helping a customer is just to much effort.... Don't waste your time there are far beter sites to choose from.</p>
