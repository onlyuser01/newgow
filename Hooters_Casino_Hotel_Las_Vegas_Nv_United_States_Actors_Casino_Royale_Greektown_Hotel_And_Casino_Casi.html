<p>Angry Dogs review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Angry Dogs is themed around fierce canines and their innercity home.</p>
<p>Players will stride through a shadowy alley to find a selection of cute and ferocious dogs. Surrounded by graffiti, bones, and cans of dog food, players will join the teeth-baring pups for a gritty adventure.</p>
<p>Angry Dogs is a good fit for players in the mood for a comical atmosphere and plenty of cartoon animals.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack has a mournful hip-hop tone that reinforces the innercity atmosphere. The reels spin with a shuffling sound that blends with the music’s percussion notes.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see a selection of cartoon dogs with fierce expressions. Despite their angry appearance, most of these canine characters are also quite cute, and dog-lovers may have fun spotting their favorite breed.</p>
<p>Above the reels, a black alley cat with glowing yellow eyes watches the game. She is both mysterious and adorable as she cleans her paws and peers down at the symbols.</p>
<p>In the background, the gritty alley can be seen with graffiti and bits of trash strewn around. Sharp-eyed players will appreciate the attention to detail as they spot the amusing warning signs and dog-themed artwork.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Angry Dogs creates an amusing world of street-savvy animals.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Angry Dogs is a five reel, four row slot, with 25 win lines.</p>
<p>The gameplay is swift and smooth, ensuring players' attention will remain locked on the reels.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols to complete winning combinations.</p>
<p>The Mystery Doghouse is a 4-symbol stack that may appear on any reel and triggers the Reveal feature when it lands.</p>
<p>The Reveal feature prompts the Mystery Doghouse to show a paying symbol or the Golden Bulldog symbol.</p>
<p>When a Golden Bulldog symbol appears, the Golden Reveal feature begins. This prompts the Golden Bulldog to land as a Scatter or as a Bet Multiplier Paw symbol which can come with a multiplier of up to x2500.</p>
<p>When players land 3 or more Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature begins, and players will have the option to choose from a selection of posters. Their chosen poster will reveal a starting multiplier for the feature.</p>
<p>Players begin the feature with the 2nd and 4th reels filled with Mystery Doghouse symbols, and the feature continues until none of these remain. This means there is in theory no cap on the number of free spins.</p>
<p>Throughout the Free Spins feature, the multiplier increases by +1 with each spin.</p>
<p>Players have the options to buy directly into the Bonus by selecting the Buy Bonus feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>With its robust volatility and respectable RTP, Angry Dogs is a good choice for mathematically minded players.</p>
<p>The comical animal theme and animation keep the atmosphere of Angry Dogs fun, and the bonuses add further appeal.</p>
