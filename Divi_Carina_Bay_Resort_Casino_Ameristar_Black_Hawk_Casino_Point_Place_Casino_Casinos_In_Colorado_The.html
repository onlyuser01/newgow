<p>Inter Miami vs Philadelphia Union is one of the most interesting games of Week 2 of the 2023 MLS</p>
<p>Both teams started the 2023 campaign with a win, and both have huge ambitions for this season. Inter Miami is the club that’s probably done the best job with transfers during the offseason. Meanwhile, Philadelphia Union managed to keep the core of the Eastern conference-winning team intact.</p>

<p>Inter Miami Ready for Another Big Performance</p>
<p>Phil Neville’s boys started the 2023 MLS season with a 2-0 win over CF Montreal at home. It was a nice performance by the Floridians, especially knowing that the team from Canada can be very tricky sometimes. Nevertheless, Inter won the game thanks to the goals scored by their newcomer Sergiy Kryvtsov and Philadelphia Union product Shanyder Borgelin.</p>
<p>Kryvtsov had a great debut – not only did the former Shakhtar Donetsk defender score but he also helped protect Inter Miami’s net throughout the game. He’s one of the best signings this club made during the offseason, but one could argue that the very best signing is Josef Martinez.</p>
<p>Even though the Venezuelan had a quiet game last weekend, he remains one of the best forwards in the league.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Union Look Good as Usual</p>
<p>The boys from Philly destroyed Columbus Crew 4-1 in the first round of the season. Daniel Gazdag scored two penalties and recorded two assists that day. The other two goals were the work of Julian Carranza. Both of these guys were crucial last season when Philadelphia Union went all the way to the MLS Cup Final.</p>
<p>They’re still in their 20s, so one may argue that they still haven’t reached their prime. Maybe the 2023 season is when they really get to shine?</p>
<p>Philly’s fans will be glad to learn that it’s not just about those two. This team is packed with talented players, with at least one decent option for every position on the pitch.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs Philadelphia Union Prediction</p>
<p>The last time these two met, Philly won 2-1 on the road. We suspect that something similar might happen this Saturday as well. Philadelphia Union are simply the better team, but we do think Inter Miami will give them a run for their money.</p>
<p>Pick: Philadelphia Union to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
