    <h1>Sky River Casino Photos Paypal Casino Casino In Houston Hard Rock Biloxi Casino Kewadin Casino Sault</h1>

<p>We don't seem to understand each other well. First let me tell you that I play in the 5 best casinos that exist and have been playing for more than 10 years and I know exactly when the casino is wrong. All players know very well that it is up to the casino to make money, it is not up to them for the customer to make money, if that were the case no one would work. I play 8 games and whenever I start playing I never play under 100 or 200 turns as I know it goes well, all gamblers know very well that the weekend is the least chance to win as it is the busiest then. I believe that you are also players and that you are defending the casino, I have no bad words about that casino, I have already written that, so I told you to pay and try and then we will talk, I will try again without a bonus and I will let you know.</p>
