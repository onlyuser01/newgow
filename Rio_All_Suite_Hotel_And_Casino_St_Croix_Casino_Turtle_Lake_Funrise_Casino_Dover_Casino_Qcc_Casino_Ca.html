<p>The CasinoBeats Summit 2022 scheduled for May 24-26 at the Intercontinental in St Julian Malta promises to bring together thousands of delegates who will have the opportunity to come together and have their say on the quality and work of some of the leading igaming content creators over the last year.</p>
<p>CasinoBeats will help a number of developers present their products in front of a live audience and industry experts. Developers will take questions from the audience and explain how their products and the mechanics found therein innovate the industry and introduce new forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>The products will be judged by a panel of experts, including Rootz CMO Melanie Hainzer, Casumo head of casino Josefine Hellström and CEGO CEO Allan Auning-Hansen. Delegates will also have the opportunity to vote on the products they are being presented, with the vote between delegates and experts split between the two groups.</p>
<p>The winner will be announced during the Game Developer Awards Ceremony at the Hilton, Malta on May 26. There are a number of games that will vie for the title this year, including:</p>
<p>4ThePlayer - 60 Second Heist</p>
<p>Alchemy Gaming- Africa X UP™</p>
<p>AvatarUX - Lollipop™</p>
<p>ELK Studios - X-iter™</p>
<p>Evoplay - Star Guardians</p>
<p>Gamzix - Hoonga Boonga</p>
<p>Habanero - Orbs Of Atlantis</p>
<p>iSoftBet - Royale with Cheese Megaways™</p>
<p>Lady Luck Games - Madame Clues</p>
<p>Spribe - Aviator</p>
<p>Swintt - Aloha Spirit XtraLock™</p>
<p>SBC founder and CEO Rasmus Sojmark, whose company is hosting the event, welcomed the opportunity to have this event running in its current format. Sojmark was happy that new industry game developments and products can be evaluated by both delegates and experts.</p>
<p>"The special Game Innovation session at CasinoBeats Summit is a great opportunity to celebrate the teams behind the standout recent releases, hear more about the technology used in the slots, and have your say on what you think is the best game of the past year," Sojmark concluded.</p>
