<p>Sports-oriented media giants Fox Sports and Fubo TV have released the coverage schedule for the UEFA Nations League tournament. The international event is set to begin this Wednesday.</p>
<p>Fox Sports Will Provide Live Coverage</p>
<p>Each year, the UEFA Nations League attracts millions of fans of sports and sports betting. This year’s edition is scheduled to begin on June 1. Fox Sports and Fubo TV will both provide coverage of the elite soccer event, allowing fans to watch the league and stay in touch with the latest developments.</p>
<p>Fox Sports has revealed that it will cover over 40 matches between June 1 and June 1. This coverage is made possible thanks to Fox Sports’ latest deal with the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). The sports media juggernaut inked a broadcasting partnership with the UEFA last year and will stream UEFA content for the first time.</p>
<p>Sports Fans Can Watch the Action on Fox Sports 1 and Fubo TV</p>
<p>Fans will be able to watch some of the best games in the league on Fox Sports 1. On June 2, sports enthusiasts will be able to go to Fox Sports 1 and see Portugal’s match against Spain. The broadcast begins at 2:30 pm ET so fans should stay tuned.</p>
<p>The next day, fans can check Fubo TV for live coverage of the game between Denmark and France. The broadcast begins at 2:45 pm. Alternatively, players can tune in to Fox Sports 1 from 2:30 pm to see the game between Belgium and Netherlands.</p>
<p>Fox Sports will also cover the game between Croatia and France on June 6. Then, it will cover the match between Austria and France on June 10. The broadcaster will also stream France’s rematch against Croatia on June 13.</p>
<p>Fubo TV, on the other hand, has committed to broadcasting all of the games featuring England’s team (against Hungary at 12 pm on June 4, against Germany at 2:45 pm on June 7, against Italy at 2:45 pm on June 11 and against Hungary at 2:45 pm on June 14). The broadcaster will also stream the games between Spain and Switzerland and Portugal and Switzerland. The two are scheduled for June 9 and June 12 respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, the game between Germany and Italy will be broadcast on Fox Sports 1 at 2:30 pm on June 14.</p>
<p>Fox Sports Has Prepared a Strong Roster of Casters</p>
<p>Fox Sports has prepared a strong lineup of casters for the UEFA Nations League. Two of the most notable Fox Sports commentators, such as the announcer John Strong and match analyst Stu Holden, will both be making an appearance. The play-by-play announcer John Paul Dellacamera and the ex-soccer midfielder Aly Wagner will also cover some of the games.</p>
<p>The Fox Sports 1 broadcasts will also see Alexi Lalas, Aly Wagner, Maurice Edu, Stu Holden and Warren Barton comment and analyze the games. Two former soccer professionals, namely Steve Cherundolo, ex-head coach of Los Angeles FC, and Sacha Klijestan, a midfielder for Los Angeles Galaxy, will make an appearance as debut analysts.</p>
<p>In November, the UEFA selected Sportradar as its official data distribution partner. The deal covers the UEFA Nations League, among others, and will see Sportradar provide sports bettors with the freshest and most relevant official sports data.</p>
