<p>The GWU has negotiated a severance offer with Evolution over employee redundancies. As a result, the industrial dispute has been resolved and at least 100 employees have been transferred to other jobs.</p>
<p>GWU and Evolution Reach a Settlement in Redundancies Case</p>
<p>The General Workers’ Union – Malta (GWU) has concluded an industry dispute with Evolution Gaming Group and NetEnt which began following news that the companies would make 300 employees redundant.</p>
<p>The news prompted action on the part of the GWU, which represents the majority of NetEnt employees in Malta, and which sought out the help of Mifsud Bonnici Legal &amp; Advisory to reach an agreement in the matter, leading to an improved severance offer for NetEnt employees finalized in court today.</p>
<p>Working closely with GWU, Evolution has agreed to save at least 40 jobs and retain employees, details of which will be cleared out in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the GWU has sought to find employment for another 60 employees who will join various iGaming and financial services based in Malta, exemplifying GWU’s staying power in the industry and ability to assist employees in a time of need.</p>
<p>Previously, GWU successfully filed an application and imposed an injunction on redundancies until the matter has been examined closer by the trade body. The application was provisionally approved by the First Hall, Civil Court leading to present developments.</p>
<p>GWU Negotiates Further Payment and Benefits</p>
<p>As part of the agreement struck between Evolution and the GWU, each affected employee will receive an additional payment equal to €750 or roughly $920, along with other benefits, such as safeguards for employees on maternity leave and access to health benefit packages for affected employees.</p>
<p>The GWU has sought the approval of members who have been affected by the redundancies and who have voted in favor of the new conditions of severance. Commenting on the matter, GWU Secretary General Josef Bugeja had this to add:</p>
<p>“We negotiated intensely and with determination. We saved jobs to the extent that this was possible. We ensured that all those who are being let go are suitably compensated.” -GWU Secretary General Josef Bugeja</p>
<p>As a result of these developments, the GWU has officially withdrawn its court injunction. All negotiations for the trade union were carried out by Aron Mifsud Bonnici, managing partner at Mifsud Bonnici Legal &amp; Advisory who is in charge of employment law and restructuring. Bonnici was assisted by litigation and commercial advisory Partner Christopher Louis Vella.</p>
