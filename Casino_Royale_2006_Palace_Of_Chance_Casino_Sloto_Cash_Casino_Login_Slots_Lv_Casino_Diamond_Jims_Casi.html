<p>Kambi Group, a B2B provider of sports betting services to licensed B2C gaming operators, has penned yet another agreement with Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment. Several months after striking a mobile-centered deal, the two companies have inked an on-property sports betting partnership deal.</p>
<p>Kambi to Power Two Ontario Casinos</p>
<p>The agreement will see the renowned Kambi Group will power Mohegan’s Ontario-based properties with a best-in-class retail sports betting platform. As a result, Mohegan’s Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara will provide their visitors with superior wagering experiences.</p>
<p>As announced, Kambi will provide the casinos with its complete suite of high-performance sports betting services and tech. While the aforementioned tech integration is still subject to regulatory approvals, it has the potential to engage Mohegan customers like never before.</p>
<p>In addition, a total of 36 kiosks will be installed across the two Ontario venues. Further plans envision the conversion of Casino Niagara’s sports bar into a new premium retail sportsbook for sports fans.</p>
<p>A Natural Evolution of the Companies’ Relationship</p>
<p>The agreement expands the existing partnership between the supplier and the tribal operator. Representatives of the two companies shared their thoughts about the new agreement.</p>
<p>Niagara Casinos’ president Richard Taylor said that his team is thrilled to once again join forces with Cambi and usher in new sports betting experiences at Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara. He noted that the agreement is in line with the company’s ambition to become a betting leader in Ontario.</p>
<p>With the changing landscape in gaming, we are working collaboratively with the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario and the Province to develop sports betting in Ontario. Our partnership with Kambi will continue to elevate our offerings at Niagara Casinos. Richard Taylor, president, Niagara Casinos</p>
<p>Kristian Nylén, Kambi Group’s co-founder and chief executive, also shared his thoughts. He noted that the current agreement is a natural evolution of the supplier’s partnership with Mohegan.</p>
<p>Following our online sports betting partnership with Mohegan, we are thrilled to bring the same high-quality sports betting experiences to Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara in Ontario. Kristian Nylén, CEO, Kambi Group</p>
<p>Nylén noted that the pairing of Kambi’s best-in-class sports betting solutions and Mohegan’s brand recognition will result in great experiences for guests of Fallsview Casino and Casino Niagara.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Kambi signed a deal with another tribal operator, this time in the United States. Thanks to the newly-formed agreement with the Ilani operator, the supplier was able to make a foray into the state of Washington.</p>
