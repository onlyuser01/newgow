    <h1>Divi Carina Bay Resort Casino St Croix Cherokee Valley River Casino And Hotel Four Queens Casino Hot</h1>

<p>Guys this is all a scam in this casino</p>
<p>pure mafia rip off.</p>
<p>You will never get a single euro paid out by these scammers</p>
<p>You don't have a license so you can't accept the money at all...</p>
<p>There are 100s of lawsuits against these casinos and every one is won...</p>
<p>Why do you think these companies are in Curacao or Malta, just because the legal system there doesn't prosecute?</p>
<p>Just read the forums of all the lawyers.</p>
<p>Lawsuits cannot be delivered because they are mailbox companies.</p>
<p>The addresses are also all scams</p>
<p>These and other casinos are all operated by Rabidi.</p>
<p>Take a look at the transfers, it's always the same IBAN when you transfer something..</p>
<p>And if you deposit tens of thousands of euros and have a withdrawal once... the same tricks are always used.</p>
<p>You have to verify yourself, then they supposedly can't read the photos, or the bank doesn't fit, or you have to send a utility bill, etc., etc., always the same nonsense.</p>
<p>And when a payout is approved, nothing ever arrives...it's all just fraud</p>
<p>Just a mafia</p>
<p>And if, for example, lawyers send Kagen there, they don't care</p>
<p>Because Curacao doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>And if one does come through, you simply change the operator or file for bankruptcy...</p>
<p>It's all just fraud</p>
<p>Do you only accept deposits in real time that cannot be booked back?</p>
<p>Of course you are entitled to a refund for 10 years</p>
<p>But it doesn't help, then someone just goes to jail for a few years and is still a millionaire.</p>
<p>They always refer to their terms and conditions and write that it is the responsibility of the country's player.</p>
<p>But that's not the case, if you don't have an Oasis license, it's illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Why do you have 100s of agents who watch these forums day and night and then write how sorry they are and how good and serious they are....</p>
<p>A good casino depends on the payouts</p>
<p>I prefer to play at German casinos, where you can win 1000 times but it's safe</p>
<p>For example, I have already had winnings of over 50,000</p>
<p>and then your account will simply be deleted</p>
<p>just a mafia scam</p>
<p>Only if the policy would change and you could, for example, charge back Giropay and others, then there would be a chance....</p>
<p>but until then there will be millions or billions of tiles...</p>
<p>check everything yourself</p>
<p>it is always Rabidi</p>
<p>always the same iban</p>
<p>Everything is fake, the millions of winnings like cars etc are all fake</p>
<p>Even if you get a bonus of 1000 euros, for example, you would have to wager it 45 times and win 45,000</p>
<p>that will never be the case</p>
<p>The only ones who benefit are the lawyers</p>
<p>and even forums like trustpilot have also been bought.......lol</p>
<p>everything fake</p>
