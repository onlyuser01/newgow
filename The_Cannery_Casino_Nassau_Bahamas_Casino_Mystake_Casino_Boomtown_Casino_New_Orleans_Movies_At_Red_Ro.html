    <h1>The Cannery Casino Nassau Bahamas Casino Mystake Casino Boomtown Casino New Orleans Movies At Red Ro</h1>

<p>I have not activated any kind of bonus code or clicked any bonus offers, first deposit bonuses or anything of that nature.</p>
<p>I have made several deposits and played with deposited funds only.</p>
<p>won £168.40 from a £25 deposit. I tried to make a withdrawal of £160 as the bank transfer option for withdrawals stated I could make a minimum withdrawal of £100 and a maximum withdrawal of £168.40.</p>
<p>Upon trying to withdraw £160 I got an insufficient error message.</p>
<p>I contacted support who informed me that I had a bonus balance of £147.22.</p>
<p>I have never used a bonus at Black Magic Casino.</p>
<p>They alledge that the bonus is from cashback of 5%. If this is the case I had absolutely no idea that this cashback came with wagering requirements but if this is the case then why does the bank transfer withdrawal option state that I can withdraw a maximum of £168.40.</p>
<p>I contacted support and questioned the bonus and asked to be sent details of the bonus in question.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later my account was restricted leaving me no access to my account and unable to check any bonuses.</p>
<p>I have contacted support several times asking why my account has been restricted but Black Magic Casino have not responded.</p>
<p>They have taken approximately £400 in deposits and have now prevented a £160 withdrawal so basically I have been robbed. My deposits have gone to 7 different payment addresses and this is not the first time they have prevented a withdrawal.</p>
<p>When I first joined black magic casino I won £160 but could not make a withdrawal as black magic casino delayed verification for approximately a week.</p>
<p>I have emailed/messaged support at Black Magic Casino on several occasions but have had no response/reply whatsoever with regards to my account restriction</p>
