    <h1>Chumba Casino Slots Casino Lake Tahoe Finger Lakes Casino And Racetrack Treasure Island Resort And C</h1>

<p>On Sat 17, Sept 2022.</p>
<p>I encountered a very sensitive problem. That later being denied by the casino support staff by confirming from the Game software provider that There is no error, the game ran correctly also Paid out correctly.</p>
<p>That wasn't true. What I witnessed and recorded that raising a lot of concern Regarding to the Randomness and Fairness of the online slots provided by The Bet soft Gaming company.</p>
<p>To make it easy to understand.</p>
<p>I will tell the easiest story.</p>
<p>Everyday, Mr B input $4 in a Giovanni Gem's stocks. Using Bitstarz Market exchange. He also put his money on the other stock at Bitstarz for more than 2 years. For awhile, he got his patience and loyalty rewarded. from The Giovanni Gem's, he is granting 7 Bonus free Game feature.</p>
<p>The mood turn odds, at the same time granting him a bonus feature, he got kicked out of the game, due to " no internet access".</p>
<p>Talking to himself:</p>
<p>"Hmm, I've had this before. Something unsusal like this can't happen twice, it can't be that coincidence."</p>
<p>He quickly reset the Browser, deleted all cached and cookies from history.</p>
<p>Reset the device that he's been playing.</p>
<p>5 mins later, he managed to log back in the Game.</p>
<p>In shock, by his eyes, he saw his input bet aMount is $1 instead of $4 he's been playing.</p>
<p>And because the game is in the bonus Feature.</p>
<p>It absolutely have different payout result by placing the different bet amount. In this case, his bet amount was adjusted 4 times smaller.</p>
<p>(?) Big question mark:</p>
<p>Is that Why he got kicked out due to no internet access????</p>
<p>Can't tell.</p>
<p>He took a screenshot</p>
<p>Exit game</p>
<p>Go to bet history page to make sure it wasn't him who changed the bet amount.</p>
<p>No, he didn't, the bet history showing he still playing with $4.</p>
<p>Then, Bringing this issue to casino Bitstarz via chat support 4 times, just to ask them having the game running correctly with his bet amount. He want to see it that way, the way it supposed to.</p>
<p>After few hours, his request got declined, state everything was correct and paid out correctly (!!?) What??? Im not even play the game as i exit the game and waiting for the correction</p>
<p>How do they know I got 0.062,88 ETH as a result.</p>
<p>No comment, they just closed the case. Mark it solved</p>
<p>From 19:54 Saturday to 6:50 Sunday.</p>
<p>Almost 12 hrs, frustrated and confused</p>
<p>He went back to the Giovanni Gem's and Finished the Game.</p>
<p>They were right</p>
<p>The game is running at $1 bet amount and having it finished eith 0.062,88 bonus rewarded.</p>
<p>He have that Recorded all of it.</p>
<p>Second question concern of</p>
<p>Randomness online slot game, it was set, everything was taken and given purposely not randomly. If not, how could they know???</p>
<p>To show his disappointed on the casino decision. He empty his balance (0.16 ETH) as he told the staff he would.</p>
