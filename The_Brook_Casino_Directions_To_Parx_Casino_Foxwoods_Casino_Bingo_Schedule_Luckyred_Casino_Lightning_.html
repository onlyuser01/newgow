<p>Lottomart has added to its existing content library in the United Kingdom through the rollout of additional Slingo titles</p>
<p>Gaming Realms is an established and trusted supplier of innovative titles and is known specifically for its Slingo out-of-the-box game library. Popular games that will now be available with Lottomart include Slingo Piggy Bank and Slingo Money Train, as well as Slingo Da Vinci Diamonds and Slingo Lucky Larry’s Lobstermania.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms Boosts Lottomart’s Portfolio</p>
<p>Many of the games are the in-house development of Gaming Realms, but some are a collaboration between the company and established franchises, such as Relax Gaming’s Money Train, which transforms the experience and allows players to experience popular games in new and entertaining ways.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has been providing content to the UK market for several years now after it launched in 2018 with the permission of the country’s Gambling Commission. Meanwhile, Lottomart is keen to continue expanding its game variety, with the operator presently bringing live games, slots, progressive games, instants, lottery betting, and scratchcards.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms Director of Partnerships Mouhcine Jalili was pleased with the opportunity to see his company continue to grow its local presence in one of its core markets, and further strengthen its presence there while helping Lottomart also engage with its own audiences.</p>
<p>“Our existing portfolio of games, as well as our upcoming roadmap, is sure to delight Lottomart’s players, offering unique and thrilling experiences that cater to a wide range of preferences,” Jalili added.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has also been building its portfolio by adding new titles, but also focusing on new groundbreaking features that can further consolidate the company’s status as a leading provider of solutions for the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>Slingo Is Popular with Brands All Across Europe</p>
<p>In July, the company introduced its Saucy Slingo game which features free rounds mechanic. The product was launched with MrQ, a casino. Gaming Realms has also been well-established in other jurisdictions in Europe besides the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Recently, the company struck a partnership to boost the content library of SkillOnNet brands in Spain. The company’s signature feature has been gaining so much momentum that Entain receive the rights to develop its own unique title in the Slingo genre.</p>
