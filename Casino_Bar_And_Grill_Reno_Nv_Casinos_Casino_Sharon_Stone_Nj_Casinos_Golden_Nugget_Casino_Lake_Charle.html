    <h1>Casino Bar And Grill Reno Nv Casinos Casino Sharon Stone Nj Casinos Golden Nugget Casino Lake Charle</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been a player at VulcanVegas since November 2021. I used to play there very regularly until the 10th of August, 2023. From that day, when I attempted to log in, I received a message stating "This User is blocked", and was no longer able to log in.</p>
<p>The support chat only referred me to the casino's terms and conditions, stating the casino has the right to suspend my account. When I inquired about the reason for the suspension, they simply said, "I cannot disclose the reason to you".</p>
<p>My latest withdrawal went through smoothly on the same day to my eWallet at Mifinity. So, there are no issues with the non-payment of money.</p>
<p>About four weeks ago, I requested a deposit-withdrawal statement from the casino because Mifinity needed this proof. I received this proof on the 11th of August, 2023, one day after my account was suspended. Could this be related in any way?</p>
<p>On the 9th of August, 2023, I initiated a 7-day gaming pause at the partner casino, Verde...could it also have affected VulcanVegas?</p>
<p>I've always been satisfied with VulcanVegas and would like to continue playing there.</p>
<p>I am curious to hear what the representative of VulcanVegas has to say about this.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
