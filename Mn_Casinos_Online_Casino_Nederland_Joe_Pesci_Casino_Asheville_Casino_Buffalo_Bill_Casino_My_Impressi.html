    <h1>Mn Casinos Online Casino Nederland Joe Pesci Casino Asheville Casino Buffalo Bill Casino My Impressi</h1>

<p>I was very optimistic about Casino Guru when I first registered and filed a complaint. I had genuinely believed that maybe this would be a different process than the standard affiliate-funded sites that use complaints as a marketing tactic, but this seems to be the case.</p>
<p>To be fair, I think it matters on who you are bringing the complaint against.</p>
<p>Let me explain. My complaint is "open" and can be found here:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/mbitcasino-player-s-attempts-to-close-the-account</p>
<p>The one thing that makes my complaint unique from every other single complaint? It is the only one where all of the information is made private/censored,</p>
<p>Even my follow up posts are private, which is exactly the same thing I have experienced elsewhere. Waiting to review is just another way of filtering out anything that could upset the people who pay for this site.</p>
<p>This was the final case summary: The player from United States has tried to close the account on several occasions. Unfortunately, all inquiries were ignored.</p>
<p>Since you cannot see the contents of my post, you may not understand how confusing this was for me to read. My complaint was two parts, the first being Mbit refusing to acknowledge my attempts to close my accounts due to problem gambling.</p>
<p>The second complaint, which was the bigger of the two, was about how since signing up for my account in 2016, I did not know that players from the United States were not allowed to play at their casino. The sign up process was different, and they never told me this, or had me click terms to agree to. The next week, I had to do a KYC, and send in my United States passport, my Minnesota drivers license, and a screenshot of my Minnesota IP address.</p>
<p>After a while, I had to re-verify my account, because some information "was missing" according to mbit. When I went to select the United States, it was not on the list to my surprise. I asked the support what to do, since the US was missing, and they instructed me "to choose any other country." I have all of this documented, which is Mbit breaching their license, breaching their own terms of service, and putting me in the losing end of every situation since they now would argue I lied about my location.</p>
<p>Or the fact that Mbit has become a rogue casino, refuses to respond with documents they are required to have.</p>
<p>None of this was mentioned at all in the complaint follow up this was given.</p>
<p>The response given to me was a copy and pasted to another complaint response before mine made it to the chopping block.</p>

<p>What a wonderful affiliate-funded third party complaint site, that filters out the sites that pay them more than the others. This took you four days to come to this conclusion? To not read the complaint and just copy/paste and hide the information of my post or follow up from the rest of the users?</p>
<p>I was also told that because Mbit blocked my account, that now they would have to reject my complaint. Wonder why all these complaints are able to move forward, even though they were blocked.</p>

<p>https://casino.guru/black-diamond-casino-player-s-account-has-been-blocked-3</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/unibet-casino-uk-player-s-account-has-been-suspended</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/slotty-slots-casino-player-s-account-has-been-blocked</p>
<p>I wanted someone to help mediate and open the conversation between this casino, but it is clear that my post will be once again shielded from people seeing it, as other interests are at play.</p>
<p>Luckily I already have followed the protocol very carefully that Antillephone NV requires, and after checking off all the requirements, and the fact that Mbit wonâ€™t respond, I filed an official complaint that was accepted against Mbit Casino.</p>
<p>I am uploading this to Pastebin since they will probably ban me shortly after posting, what might be the first, honest review on this site.</p>
<p>Feel free to message me on at mumblesmountain@gmail.com if you would like a full copy of my report, so you can see just how insulting of a response this was to receive from them.</p>
<p>Just like Mbit did with my attempts to close my account from problem gambling, Casino Guru chose to ignore all the sections of my complaint that</p>
<p>1) Provided factual, evidence via screenshots</p>
<p>2) Made Mbit look like the rogue casino that they have chosen to act like</p>
<p>3) Affect their affiliate earnings.</p>
