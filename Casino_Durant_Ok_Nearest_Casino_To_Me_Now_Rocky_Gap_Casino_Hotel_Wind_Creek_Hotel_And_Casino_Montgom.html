<p>Yes. Speaking from my own experience, they give these prizes including luxurious trips abroad, but there's one major problem about it. The casinos are often forced by the licensing authority to offer compensations for these trips or prizes. For example, you can win the new iPhone, the casino promotes the competition for the iPhone, but when you win it, they often have to offer you the iPhone or financial compensation, which would be maybe 1200$ or you win a trip to Las Vegas, but you are allowed to choose 10,000$ compensation.</p>
<p>Most of the winners (I would say over 90%) take the money instead of the prize. It's kind of better for the casino, because they don't need to arrange the trip for the winner or order the prize and send it to the foreign countries across the World. They just add cash on your casino account, which you can withdraw immediately.</p>
