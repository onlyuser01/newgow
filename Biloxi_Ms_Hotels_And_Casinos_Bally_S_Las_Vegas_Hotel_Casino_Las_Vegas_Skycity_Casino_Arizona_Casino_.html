<p>NuxGame will be able to provide the range of services it offers to partners with the addition of a leading sportsbook supplier</p>
<p>BETBY, a company that specializes in the development and deployment of sportsbook software, will now provide NuxGame with its proprietary solutions. This way NuxGame’s own customers will have access to BETBY’s leading sportsbook solutions, hailed by the industry as cutting-edge and market-defining.</p>
<p>NuxGame to Offer Partners Sports and Esports Betting Solutions</p>
<p>BETBY’s product offer has been well-received in both emerging and mature markets across the globe and it continues to provide value to partner operators to this day. The company was established in 2018 and it’s one of the youngest tech suppliers for the sports betting industry.</p>
<p>The company’s strength lies in developing intuitive and easy-to-integrate software that responds to market needs and helps predict trends in the sports betting vertical, giving BETBY’s an important place in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Apart from providing a distinct selection of sportsbook-focused solutions, BETBY is also delivering its cutting-edge esports betting solutions through its Betby.Games, which offers wagers on popular video games. The vertical has been gaining momentum, especially with Gen Z and Millennial generations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BETBY provides a high volume of wagering markets, with more than 700,000 competitions. Welcoming the new partner, NuxGame head of sales and business development Bar Konson said:</p>
<p>We are thrilled with the opportunity to collaborate with BETBY, with the company’s products and platform renowned for its vast array of markets and content for its partners. NuxGame’s Bar Konson</p>
<p>He said that this integration with BETBY is bound to lead to some significant results and opportunities for the company, allowing it to form a fruitful partnership that is bound to continue benefiting both companies.</p>
<p>BETBY’s Determined to Provide Partners with Sterling Experiences</p>
<p>BETBY CCO Chris Nikolopoulos was similarly excited about this opportunity, adding that the company was very happy to partner up with NuxGame and provide its customers with “next-generation betting opportunities.”</p>
<p>BETBY is firmly focused on innovating the sector and bringing more worthwhile sports and esports betting solutions for iGaming operators and platform providers. BETBY has been working on expanding its reach with various platforms, offering its products to operators that are well-established in the online casino and sports wagering verticals, or looking to strengthen their presence there.</p>
<p>A new partnership with FortuneJack and BETBY was announced in July with a similar deal arranged between Africa365 and Betby. In both cases, BETBY is looking to consolidate its foothold as the go-to option for sportsbook and esports betting technology and solutions.</p>
