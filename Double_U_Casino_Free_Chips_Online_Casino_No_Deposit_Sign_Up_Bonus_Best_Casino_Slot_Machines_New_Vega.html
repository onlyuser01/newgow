<p>AC Milan is further fueling its expansion into the Asian market, claiming to be the favorite Italian team in China for two years in a row, citing YouGov research.</p>
<p>Milan Expanding into Asian Gaming Market</p>
<p>M88 Mansion is one of the leaders in the online gaming scene in Asia and its new partnership with the Italian soccer club AC Milan was announced on Rossoneri’s website on August 1. This means that M88 will be the new Regional Poker and Casino Partner of Milan for the Asian region.</p>
<p>The announcement details an upcoming launch of a new gaming portal dubbed AC Milan Studio on M88’s platform. It will be “designed exclusively” for Milan and is expected to provide “a number of AC Milan-themed games”.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the new partnership reflects the growing popularity of the club name in Asia, citing YouGov research, according to which, Milan is the “best-regarded Italian Club in China” and has been for two years in a row now.</p>
<p>Betting Players Make Moves in Sports</p>
<p>Just at the beginning of March, we saw M88 Mansion partnering with the Badminton World Federation (BWF), becoming its official betting partner. As we reported back then, the three-year deal was arranged by Infront – BWF’s broadcast and commercial partner, as well as Outlast Sports and Entertainment. The partnership is covering multiple BWF Major Championships.</p>
<p>M88 is not the only player in the gambling field that partners with soccer clubs and teams, however. The Zeturf Group also announced a soccer team partnership on August 1 – this time with a French Ligue 1 soccer club, the FC Nantes. According to the deal, the Group’s Zebet betting brand will be appearing on the team’s shorts through 2025.</p>
<p>Just Monday before, on July 25, Fulham FC – the English Premier League soccer team – also confirmed a sponsorship deal with W88 for the upcoming season of 2022/2023. W88 is also operating heavily in the Asian market, and moving away from it, about 2 weeks before the Fulham-W88 partnership, SuperSport hit the news cycle with its own soccer-related news.</p>
<p>SuperSport is a well-known international betting operator and it became the First Football League’s (it’s Croatia’s top-tier soccer league) main sponsor. Thanks to this, the league was actually renamed to HNL, further establishing itself in a market that had already provided a warm welcome with the 2021 sponsorship for the Croatian Football Cup.</p>
