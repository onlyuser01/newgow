    <h1>Online Casinos Pa Aria Resort Casino Reviews Diamond Jo Casino Worth Cool Cat Casino No Deposit Bonu</h1>

<p>NOVOMATIC Gaming and Entertainment’s division has announced its intention to diversify its product offering on the German market using SYNOT Games’ freshest titles.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the new partnership, SYNOT’s most successful games will become available for players accessing the StarGames.de platform. The latter is Greentube’s online site designed for German players.</p>
<p>Initial Roll-Out of SYNOT Games, Ready for Launch</p>
<p>Zeus Wild Thunder, Hunter’s Spirit, and Book of Secrets are just some of the initial hit slot games that will be rolled out on the German-facing gaming platform website. More games are expected to reach the German platform in the near future, with the possibility to extend to additional markets outside Germany where Greentube is currently present.</p>
<p>StarGames’ brand manager Laszlo Pados has expressed their excitement regarding the addition of SYNOT’s hit content to their platform, anticipating customers’ positive feedback. Describing the games as “hugely popular amongst German players”, Pados also explained the new partnership has been “a logical choice” for their strategy meant to turn StarGames.de into a leading platform on the online slots market in the country.</p>
<p>The Greentube Deal, a “Meaningful Milestone” for SYNOT Games</p>
<p>SYNOT Games’ chief commercial officer, Martina Hrabinska, called the new deal inked with Greentube “a great achievement” that marks an important milestone in their plan to keep growing its presence in global regulated markets. Hrabinska also expressed confidence that their prestigious collection of games will receive a warm welcome from German players via the StarGames.de site.</p>
<p>As the first brand to offer the original Book of Ra title to the German market, StarGames managed to successfully establish a solid presence in Germany thanks to its constantly expanding portfolio of top slot games. In February, StarGames obtained a nationwide license from the Gambling Authority of the Federal States of Germany that would allow it to provide online slots throughout the country.</p>
<p>This means that both the StarGames.de platform and Greentube’s processes on Responsible Gaming, anti-money laundering, IT security and game mechanics have been deemed compliant with the Interstate Treaty 2021. In other words, the German Gambling Authority has officially recognized Greentube as “a safe and secure place for German players to enjoy the best Novomatic and Greentube games.”</p>
<p>In January, Greentube strengthened its foothold in Latin America by signing an agreement with LatamWin. At the start of February, Greentube obtained a license to operate in Connecticut as an authorized online gaming service provider.</p>
