    <h1>Ho Chunk Casino Wittenberg Talking Stick Resort And Casino Brango Casino 100 Free Chip Four Winds On</h1>

<p>I deposited last Friday sept 22, for a third time only $300 in total, but had no issues depositing Bitcoin. First few deposits I lost and it was fine better luck next time right?</p>
<p>and yes deposited $70 then $93 finally started winning at blackjack off an on then on slots, ran my balance up to $1500 files for a withdrawal of $1250. Continued to play and took the remaining $250 up to around $1180 and decided to call it a night. Get up Saturday morning try to log in and there it was your account has been disabled please contact customer support on details.</p>
<p>I then immediately start emailing. Disputes department, the account department and support. 48 hours later I get an automated response from all 3 saying about the same thing and offering me bonuses the next time I deposit if I use Bitcoin. Wtf I been depositing with Bitcoin not using any bonuses for the reason in case I win I could withdrawal without worry from playthrough or any other bogus requirements. Any way it’s been almost week so much for the 24-48 hour crypto Bitcoin withdrawal time. That’s just to get you in. They responded again today the 26th saying they cannot message the reasoning why account is disabled so they asked for my phone number and a decent time to call me to discuss issue. I don’t understand what issue they have. Maybe that I won and tried to withdraw.</p>
<p>so waiting going on the first 24 hours of the phone call response almost a week since I’ve won and requested a withdraw and account was disabled. I havnt filed a complaint yet but just thought I’d share for other people if you play at ignition casino and win more than you spend it seems like in reading other reviews as well that they disable your account. Scam. A big cheating scam is what I think so far. Even if they end up paying me, they lied about the quick withdrawal via Bitcoin why I deposited and played there in the first place. Very disgruntled I needed that money was counting on it days ago. Now I’m stressed out I’m not gonna get anything cause they can make up any ol excuse as to not pay. Anyway I’ll keep it updated. Thanks for reading</p>
