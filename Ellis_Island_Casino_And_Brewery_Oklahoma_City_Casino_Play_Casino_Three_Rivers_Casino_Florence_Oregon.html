<p>England vs. Australia cricket series a.k.a. The Ashes is one of the most intense rivalries in the sports, with the first-ever duel being played 141 years ago</p>
<p>So far, The Ashes series has been played 72 times, with the Aussies winning 34 times, England 32 times, and six of the series ended up tied. A total of 356 Test matches have been played, with Australia leading 150-110-96 (W-L-D). England hasn’t won the Urn since 2015, but the last time The Ashes took place in Britain, the series finished in a draw. Obviously, “The Three Lions” are good on their turf and with the help of their fans, they’re hoping to upset the odds this coming weekend.</p>

<p>England are Usually Very Good at Home</p>
<p>It was 1882 when England lost to Australia at The Oval, which inspired The Sporting Times to write a mock obituary, stating that England’s cricket has died and “the ashes (are) taken to Australia.” That’s how England vs. Australia cricket rivalry got its name – The Ashes.</p>
<p>Well, since then, the two have played a total of 72 The Ashes series, half of which took place in England. And half of those were won by “The Three Lions.”</p>
<p>Since the start of the 21st century, England has hosted The Ashes on six occasions. Four of those six series were won by the home side, while Australia only got one win (in 2001). The most recent The Ashes on English soil finished in a draw (2019).</p>
<p>Being good at home is one of the reasons why England players are feeling confident ahead of The Ashes of 2023. Another reason is that their recent form has been fantastic. In the build-up to The Ashes, England got a 10-wicket victory over Ireland.</p>
<p>Reasons Why Aussies are Favored to Win 1st Test of The Ashes 2023</p>
<p>England’s victory over Ireland has made these guys confident about their game. However, they’re nowhere near as confident as Australians. It’s because Australia is coming off a big win over India last week, which made them the World Test Champions.</p>

<p>They did it at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London, meaning that they’ve already made themselves feel at home in England. Sure, this weekend the crowd will be rooting against them, but they probably won’t mind.</p>
<p>After all, they’ve got another major reason to be confident about their abilities. The last time they played England in The Ashes, they won the series without losing a Test. The final record was 4-0-1 in the series.</p>
<p>England vs. Australia The Ashes 1st Test Prediction</p>
<p>With batters like Travis Head and Steve Smith, as well as bowlers like Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon, Australia is the best cricket team in the world in 2023. However, under Ben Stokes’s captaincy, England have been incredibly aggressive, and that exactly might be the way to defeat the Aussies. If they go all-in in The Ashes, they might have some success.</p>
<p>Sure, they might not win the series, but no one should be surprised if they blitzed their way to a win in the 1st Test.</p>
<p>Pick: England to win the 1st Test</p>
