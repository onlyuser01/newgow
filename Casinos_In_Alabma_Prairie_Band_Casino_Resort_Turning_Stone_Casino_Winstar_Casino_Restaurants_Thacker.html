<p>Esports Entertainment Group, the leading online esports entertainment company, announced on Monday that it received approval to start betting operations in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Esports Entertainment Group Receives Approval to Start Betting Operations</p>
<p>To start its betting operations, EEG received an order that approves a transaction waiver. The order was issued by the Director of the Division of Gaming Enforcement. As a result, the company was allowed to start taking bets in New Jersey. The recent approval positioned EEG as the first esports betting operator that received a transaction waiver.</p>
<p>Now, the company plans a ‚Äúsoft play‚Äù period for its VIE.gg betting platform. Starting this afternoon, the soft play period introduces partial restrictions to the online experience. EEG explained that those limitations ‚Äúmust be applied to the online experience to ensure proper regulatory operations.‚Äù The soft play period is expected to last for five days.</p>
<p>Once officially launched, EEG‚Äôs VIE.gg platform will allow esports fans and bettors to place bets on esports teams in real-time. Moreover, the platform offers an immersive and seamless player experience. Combining the growing interest in esports with the fact that New Jersey is the 11th most-populous US state, EEG is expected to solidify its presence in the state quickly.</p>
<p>Starting off Monday with a bang! We've been granted approval to begin betting operations in the state of New Jersey, becoming the first esports operator to receive a transactional waiver in the Garden State.</p>
