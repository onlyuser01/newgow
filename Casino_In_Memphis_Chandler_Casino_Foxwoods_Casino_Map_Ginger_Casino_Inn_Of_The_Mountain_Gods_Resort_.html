    <h1>Casino In Memphis Chandler Casino Foxwoods Casino Map Ginger Casino Inn Of The Mountain Gods Resort</h1>

<p>I registered with OLYBET casino principally for the purpose of acquiring a bonus.</p>
<p>I previously reviewed all the conditions that were available on the site.</p>
<p>On the page under the section "Bonus Enhancement of 5000 EUR", it is written that upon making your first deposit between 51 euro and 500 euro, you establish a bonus of 500 EUR.</p>
<p>Immediately below that is a sentence:</p>
<p>"After making a deposit, you need to play at least 20 times the value of your first deposit within 90 days in the online casino to meet the conditions for bonus acquisition. Different types of games are counted towards fulfillment as follows:"</p>
<p>That you are required to bet 20 times the first deposit rather than the bonus amount grabbed my attention.</p>
<p>The bonus should always be credited in parts after each 20% of the required amount is wagered.</p>
<p>I fulfilled this obligation and the bonus was not credited. I also called their customer care number afterwards, where they confirmed over the phone that it's the deposit, not the bonus, that one is required to wager. Similarly, I further addressed the matter in a chat, explaining my situation and their response was that they would forward the issue to the IT department for inspection.</p>
<p>Only today did I receive a response:</p>
<p>"You will receive the bonus after four turnovers of 500 euros each, i.e. 2000 euros. 20 percent of the amount 500 euro, not the deposit, is counted. After a turnover of 2000 euro, you receive 100 euro."</p>
<p>This information was neither published on the site nor communicated to me on the recorded phone line.</p>
<p>I object to this deceptive marketing wherein I was not awarded what was explicitly stated in the conditions on the site.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
