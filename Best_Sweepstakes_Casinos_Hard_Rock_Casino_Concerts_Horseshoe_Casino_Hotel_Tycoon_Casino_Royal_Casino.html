<p>Provider of gaming technology and content Inspired Entertainment announced today it has extended its Retail Virtual Sports agreement with Betfred, a long-time partner of the gaming tech supplier.</p>
<p>Extending a Successful Partnership</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment and the world’s largest privately-owned retail sports betting operator Betfred announced a long-term extension to their Virtual Sports partnership.</p>
<p>Nasdaq-listed Inspired has been delivering virtual horse races, dog races and bingo products for more than 15 years to power the offering at more than 1,400 retail shops of the bookmaker with over 50 years of sports betting market experience.</p>
<p>Hailing the “proven and successful relationship” between Inspired and Betfred, Steve Rodgers, chief commercial officer for Virtual Sports at Inspired, outlined that the UK-based bookmaker was among the first to expand its content via multiple concurrent channels and witness first-hand the player engagement success of this strategy during the pre- and post-pandemic lockdown periods.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be extending our longstanding relationship, which is a testament to the strength of our Virtual offerings.” Steve Rodgers, CCO, Virtual Sports, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Available through more than 32,000 retail channels and over 100 websites across 35 countries, Inspired’s Virtual Sports proved its appeal to a wide variety of players worldwide.</p>
<p>“Inspired has been a trusted key supplier, and their Virtuals have proven to be very popular with our customers in our retail venues.” Mark Stebbings, COO, Betfred Group</p>
<p>Focusing on Inspired’s “continued innovation” in Virtual Sports and the impression its efforts have made, Stebbing outlined the excitement to continue to offer Inspired’s “best-in-class content” to Betfred customers.</p>
<p>Substitute for Real Sport Events</p>
<p>Mimicking the experience of real sports, Virtual Sports provides a continual stream of betting content for the operators, generating betting events as frequently as every two minutes. It is growing in popularity among players while driving incremental revenue for operators.</p>
<p>Inspired’s portfolio of high-profile sports betting operator partners for Virtual Sports also includes global gambling group Entain and one of the leading three sportsbook operators in the US, DraftKings.</p>
<p>Inspired added Entain to its roster of Virtual Sports partners in January last year when the parties agreed to see a rollout of the Virtual Sports content across all of Entain’s retail shops and venues and online brands.</p>
<p>DraftKings added Inspired’s V-Play Plug &amp; Play in April 2020 to offer its players across desktop and mobile to taste the excitement of the 14 virtual sports games available at that time and fill the niche opened by the mass cancellation of sporting events.</p>
