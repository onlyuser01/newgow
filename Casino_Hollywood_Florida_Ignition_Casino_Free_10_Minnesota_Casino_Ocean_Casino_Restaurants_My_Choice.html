<p>Salsa Technology, a proven expert in iGaming solutions, has unveiled a new strategic partnership. This time, the provider teamed up with RSA, a Brazilian sports betting platform provider. Under the deal, RSA’s clients will be able to seamlessly access content from Salsa Gator, Salsa Technology’s content aggregation division.</p>
<p>Salsa Gator offers a diverse selection of outstanding casino games designed to appeal to Latin American audiences. The aggregator offers both proprietary titles and third-party games, allowing its partners to quickly diversify their portfolios.</p>
<p>Salsa Gator shines in its understanding of the LATAM market. The aggregator boasts extensive experience in curating games for players in Latin America, which allows its partners to quickly grow their presence in the region.</p>
<p>RSA, on the other hand, is an emerging sports betting and iGaming specialist that hit the market three years ago. Since then, the company has been going from strength to strength, greatly bolstering its local footprint. According to the announcement, the deal with Salsa Technology will permit RSA to enhance its iGaming offerings, guaranteeing that its partnering operators will have a wide selection of engaging titles.</p>
<p>Salsa Technology Excels in Supplying Content in LATAM</p>
<p>Eliane Nunes, Salsa Technology’s head of marketing and sales, said that the partnership with RSA is something her team is looking forward to. She is certain that the Salsa Gator offering will “further elevate” RSA’s growth in the LATAM region because of the great games it offers.</p>
<p>Our carefully curated casino library will add momentum to the first three strong years of RSA growth. Eliane Nunes, head of marketing and sales, Salsa Technology</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lucas Vinicius Alencar Alves, RSA’s chief operating officer, said:</p>
<p>Our success revolves around a deep understanding of LatAm player demands and we’re highly confident that welcoming Salsa Gator’s offering to our platform will bring instant benefits to our partner operators. Lucas Vinicius Alencar Alves, COO, RSA</p>
<p>For reference, the content that RSA will be able to access thanks to its partnership with Salsa Gator, includes titles from over 80 third-party companies. Some of the games come from industry-leading suppliers, such as Pragmatic Play, High5Games, Spinomenal, RedRake, Spribe, Evolution and Hacksaw, among many others.</p>
<p>In January, Salsa Technology also agreed to provide Weebet, another Brazilian platform provider, with content. The deal was very similar to the current one, allowing Weebet to access Salsa Gator’s rich library of games from third-party suppliers.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Salsa Technology teamed up with MFA provider Miracl to boost its login process and ensure compliance with new regulations.</p>
