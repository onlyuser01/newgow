    <h1>The Strat Hotel Casino Skypod Casino Bus Trips Near Me Seneca Casino Salamanca Ny Circa Resort And C</h1>

<p>Geolocation services provider Xpoint announced Friday it has become a board-level member of the American Gaming Association (AGA) and the company’s co-founder and CEO, Marvin Sanderson, will serve on the AGA’s board of directors.</p>
<p>‘Looking Forward to Being Active Participants’</p>
<p>Xpoint’s board-level member statute with the US casino industry trading body is evidence of the growing presence of the geolocation and compliance technology company in the US and the role it plays in helping the AGA foster a legal and regulated environment for the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news that Xpoint has been accepted as a board-level member of the AGA, Sanderson said how proud everyone at the company feels to join the association, “looking forward to being active participants across a range of the organization’s interests.”</p>
<p>Besides its co-founder and CEO serving on the board, several Xpoint C-suite leadership teams will be involved with the association, sitting on a range of committees and task forces to represent the geolocation services industry that is turning out to be a key growth component of the sports betting and online casino gaming industry in the US.</p>
<p>“The AGA is rightly celebrated as the premier membership organization in our primary market,” Sanderson continued, honored “to be sitting alongside” industry peers and “helping shape the future” of the industry, its partners and fellow associated companies.</p>
<p>Joining the AGA is the biggest industry recognition of the nascent geolocation technology company which debuted in partnership with SkillOnNet in the Canadian province of Ontario in June this year and has been growing fast ever since.</p>
<p>Fast-Growing across North America</p>
<p>Currently, Xpoint is live with Sporttrade and PlayStar in New Jersey, providing its partners with the real-money geolocation solution Xpoint Verify, as well as with BettorFantasy and Flex Fantasy offering the fantasy sports operators its solution tailored for daily fantasy sports operators, Xpoint Lite, across multiple US jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Last month, Xpoint announced multi-million funding round which saw The Raine Group, SuRo Capital Sports, and Acies Investments join previous investors at Xpoint, Courtside Ventures and Bettor Capital.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of the provider of geolocation services in North America attracted unhealthy interest from its competitor GeoComply which launched legal action against the Delaware-headquartered firm claiming patent infringement rights.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking an injunctive relief by the court to stop Xpoint from further infringing GeoComply’s patent rights but Xpoint came out with a statement claiming that the patent infringement allegations are “meritless.”</p>
