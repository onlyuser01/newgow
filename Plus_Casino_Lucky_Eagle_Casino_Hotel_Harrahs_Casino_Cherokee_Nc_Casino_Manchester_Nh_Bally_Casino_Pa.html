    <h1>Plus Casino Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel Harrahs Casino Cherokee Nc Casino Manchester Nh Bally Casino Pa</h1>

<p>The Australian casino operator released an official statement, revealing that illegal online gambling websites had been using Crown’s intellectual property to deceive consumers</p>
<p>Crown Resorts urged the community to exercise caution regarding counterfeit social media accounts and advertisements falsely using Crown’s identity. The operator was adamant that online gambling in Australia was strictly prohibited, reaffirming it did not offer any form of iGaming. Such developments further threaten Crown’s public image as the company struggles with reforms.</p>
<p>The Operator Urged People to Report Any Offending Websites</p>
<p>Crown’s official warning highlighted the rising prevalence of fraudulent social media accounts, advertisements, or apps that utilize Crown’s name, logo, images, and other identifying information. The operator was adamant it did not operate an online casino or provide any form of online gambling, as its activities are only limited to its physical venues.</p>
<p>Crown Resorts advised the public to refrain from engaging with such suspicious accounts, avoid disclosing personal information or credit card details, and promptly report fraudulent content or suspicious activity. Despite the Australian government’s efforts to curb illegal online operators, the country struggles to enforce its regulations, leaving many people vulnerable to gambling harm.</p>
<p>Crown continuously works with social media and technology companies to seek removal of fraudulent content as a priority. Crown Resorts official statement</p>
<p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has been the country’s leading authority in identifying and dealing with illegal online operators. It regularly requests internet service providers to block offending websites and has been steadily intensifying its efforts. However, such measures usually have limited success as offending operators can change their IP address and circumvent restrictions.</p>
<p>Crown Still Struggles to Regain Compliance</p>
<p>The cautionary message comes amid Crown Resorts’ comprehensive reform initiatives across its Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth integrated resorts. The company is actively working to regain its casino licenses following inquiries in these three states, which delivered unfavorable assessments. Regulators have generally observed steady progress, raising hopes for the beleaguered operator.</p>
<p>Notably, Crown Melbourne recently implemented mandatory time and loss limits for all patrons using electronic gaming machines in compliance with recommendations from the Finkelstein Royal Commission. The company’s rigorous reform agenda is paying off in other jurisdictions, thanks to company-wide safer gambling initiatives and a determination to return to suitability.</p>
<p>Despite Crown’s progress, some recent developments have raised new integrity concerns. The company’s CEO is under investigation over allegations that he allowed removed patrons back into the company’s properties. If confirmed, these suspicions could substantially hinder Crown’s progress toward compliance, and seeing the company’s logo on illegal websites does little to improve its image.</p>
