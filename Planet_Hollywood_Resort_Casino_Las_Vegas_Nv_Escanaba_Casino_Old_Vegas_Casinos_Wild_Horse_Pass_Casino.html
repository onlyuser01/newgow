    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Las Vegas Nv Escanaba Casino Old Vegas Casinos Wild Horse Pass Casino</h1>

<p>I have recently been playing on the Solitaire Cash app, owned by Papaya Gaming, and have made a significant number of deposits, but realised they are charging VAT.</p>
<p>I am based in the U.K. and have previously played on Papaya's other apps such as Bingo Cash and Bubble Cash, and have never been charged VAT, nor has it ever been mentioned.</p>
<p>i queried this with Papaya, and received these responses:</p>
<p>"The additional charge is for the sales tax, and it's visible to you before completing your purchase.</p>
<p>Sales Taxes are placed on any sale of goods and services as required by applicable local law in each state/country and are calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the tax rate in your area. We are obliged to charge this fee based on your current location"</p>
<p>"Firstly, it's important to highlight that we, Papaya Gaming, are not a gambling platform. We offer solely skill-based games such as Solitaire Cash, Bubble Cash, Bingo Cash, and 21 Cash.</p>
<p>Papaya's services are considered electronically supplied services ("ESS") and those are taxable services according to applicable law.</p>
<p>We can further assure you that we are acting in full accordance with our tax advisor's guidance.</p>
<p>In addition, it's important to note that we are as transparent as possible in this regard.</p>
<p>The transaction amount and levied tax are displayed fully before completing your purchase."</p>
<p>I still believe this information is incorrect, and want to clarify this first, and then wonder if I am able to reclaim my VAT payments?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
