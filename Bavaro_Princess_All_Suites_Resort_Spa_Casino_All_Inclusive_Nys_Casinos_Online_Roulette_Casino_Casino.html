<p>More than 90 written responses were received regarding the DCMS inquiry into the gambling regulation in the UK that was open between December 2022 and February 2023</p>
<p>Launched in December, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee sought to examine the regulation of gambling in the UK. The Committee invited industry stakeholders such as gambling operators, nonprofit organizations, researchers and other organizations within the gambling sector to answer a series of questions.</p>
<p>The invitation for written evidence was opened through February 10, 2023. It included multiple questions regarding the market in the UK such as “what is the scale of gambling-related harm” in the country, as well as what “should the key priorities be in the gambling White Paper?”</p>
<p>Additional questions included “how broadly should the term, ‘gambling,’ be drawn” and also if it is possible “for a regulator to stay abreast of innovation in the online sphere?” The final question that the DCMS sought to receive an opinion on included “What additional problems arise when online gambling companies are based outside of UK jurisdiction?”</p>
<p>Gambling Operators and Industry Stakeholders Respond to the Inquiry</p>
<p>Now, on Tuesday, the written responses received by the DCMS regarding the Gambling Act review were published by the Public Accounts Committee. Overall, 91 different organizations or individuals submitted a response to the query of the Committee.</p>
<p>Respondents included leading betting and gaming industry operators such as 888 Holdings, bet365 and Bally’s Corporation, among others. Additionally, the DCMS inquiry received written responses from UK Hospitality, Bournemouth University, Channel 4 and The Christian Institute, among other organizations.</p>
<p>The recent publication of written evidence submitted by stakeholders within the gambling vertical comes at a time when the White Paper on the review of the Gambling Act has been delayed multiple times. In fact, by now, the White Paper is known to be in a constant “to be released” soon state, with lawmakers hinting that it will be published shortly. Yet, no solid date is set for the release of the White Paper.</p>
<p>At the same time, the single industry body representing the gaming and betting industry in the country, the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), recently released a new study outlining that a majority of gamblers in the UK favor promotions and bonus offers. The study found that 82% of gamblers favored “promotions such as free bets,” while 54% confirmed that a possible ban on such incentives may push users to the black market.</p>
