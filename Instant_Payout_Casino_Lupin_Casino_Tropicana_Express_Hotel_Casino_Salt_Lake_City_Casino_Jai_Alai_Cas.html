    <h1>Instant Payout Casino Lupin Casino Tropicana Express Hotel Casino Salt Lake City Casino Jai Alai Cas</h1>

<p>Full-service game development and design company Slot Factory has signed an agreement with White Hat Gaming. According to the new deal, the leading provider for iGaming turnkey solutions will start releasing the most popular Slot Factory titles through its platform in 2022. Brand new Slot Factory games are also up for release throughout the year.</p>
<p>Slot Factory Guarantees Top-Tier Games Via Early B2C Testing</p>
<p>With an impressive two-decade history under its belt, Slot Factory is a Business-to-Business division of Intouch Games, an iGaming operator, and developer of online and mobile games based in the United Kingdom. Throughout the years, the company has been offering the entire range of iGaming solutions to satisfied providers expanding from Europe to Asia.</p>
<p>Slot Factory is constantly busy creating and releasing new titles, with fresh-out oven games like Reel Wild 7’s, Thor’s Thunder, Bolts of Zeus, Mega Cube, and Wild Pirate King added to the list in the previous month alone. The company is currently working on the release of another much-anticipated slot, Sakura Spells, with plenty of other titles currently in the making in the state-of-the-art Slot Factory studios.</p>
<p>More than 85% of the company’s traffic originates in mobile usage. This makes the fresh portrait design added to the games’ interfaces an excellent way of creating more immersive and visually appealing experiences. One of the most distinguishing elements of the company is the fact that it can guarantee the highest possible level of flawless gaming quality for each of its games.</p>
<p>This is possible thanks to the dedicated testing system used on all games prior to their distribution. The trial takes place on dedicated Business-to-Consumer platforms that belong to Slot Factory. All operators getting ready to receive engaging titles from Slot Factory are this way guaranteed high-performing games 24/7.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the new partnership with White Hat Gaming, Slot Factory will release dozens of its original slots with names like Prize Pot Picks, Big 7 Slots, Bog Box Bonus, or Money Grows on Trees on White Hat’s platform.</p>
<p>Plus, Slot Factory plans to keep releasing new titles at its regular pace. This means additional games will be soon reaching White Hat Gaming’s platform in 2022. All of these releases are expected to create the perfect framework for a lucrative and fruitful collaboration in the long run.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming Wants Its Customers to Access Superior Gaming Content</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming is currently the market-leading supplier for iGaming titles for the American market. The company enables operators to take their pick from proprietary Player Account Management solutions or complete white-label solutions, depending on their needs.</p>
<p>Their modular setup provides enhanced flexibility to all operators. Being a successful aggregator of third-party providers, the company offers top content featuring Kambi Sportsbook, the entire array of payment solutions, practical customer relationship management tools, and more than 3000 games from 120 state-of-the-art providers.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming offers operator-branded customized Slot and Random Number Generator Table content, including Europe’s most played Jackpot mechanic, Jackpot Royale, branded hit games such as Ted and Deal or No Deal, and hundreds of slots, Full House, Megaways, or Scratchcard games.</p>
<p>The company’s vice president commercial Michael Waterfield commented on the new partnership with Slot Factory, calling the company a “credible partner” thanks to its dedication to creating top in-house titles games. The new partnership is expected to bring Slot Factory an excellent distribution platform for its content. At the same time, White Hat Gaming customers are expected to get access to the best iGaming content that can be currently accessed in the market.</p>
<p>Intouch gaming’s head of commercial Charles Mott considers the decision to partner with White Hat Gaming to be an “easy decision” due to the remarkable international reach that Slot Factory will benefit from. The new partnership will bring Slot Factory an excellent reach to more than 35 brands spread in all parts of the world.</p>
<p>Thanks to White Hat Gaming platform’s insightful tools and guidance, Mott expects Slot Factory to effectively enrich its portfolio in 2022 and tick all of its boxes in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>Slot Factory and White Hat Gaming will be both attending the ICE London 2022.</p>
<p>Slot Factory will be located on stand number N5-430, while White Hat Gaming will be found at stand N6-220. Both companies will be eagerly waiting to come across current clients to receive feedback in real-time, as well as fresh prospects and new potential customers. At the beginning of March, White Hat Studios signed a partnership with Golden Nugget Online Gaming. The latter will provide top European gambling options to the American gaming market, including slots, jackpots, and a series of full house options.</p>
