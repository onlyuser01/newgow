<p>The customers will be able to access the functionality from the casino lobby but will also have the option to participate in the action. This is facilitated via Livespins’ bet behind system that allows online customers to bet on the action. Online customers engage in the action directly by placing bets on each spin.

Customers online can use emojis and react in-game, which creates an immersive and fun experience.</p>
