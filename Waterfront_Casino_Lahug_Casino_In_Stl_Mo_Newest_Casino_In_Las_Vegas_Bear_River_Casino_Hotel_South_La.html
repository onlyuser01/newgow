    <h1>Waterfront Casino Lahug Casino In Stl Mo Newest Casino In Las Vegas Bear River Casino Hotel South La</h1>

<p>September 15 marks the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month in the US, but for JefeBet this is simply the case all year round. However, September still brings a sort of celebration of Latinos for JefeBet and its operator Fifth Street Gaming (FSG), as a complete rebranding and renovation is underway for its Lucky Club Casino and Hotel in North Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Complete Rebrand, Renovation</p>
<p>JefeBet issued a news release, available on the NewsDirect website, detailing an official groundbreaking ceremony at the site of the previous Lucky Club Casino and Hotel in North Las Vegas. Attending the ceremony were FSG chief executive officer Seth Schorr, North Las Vegas Councilwoman Pamela Goynes-Brown, as well as a few Las Vegas Latino Chamber of Commerce representatives. Joining them was of course the new dining partner Ojos Locos, as the establishment will now be carrying the new name of Ojos Locos Sports Cantina y Casino at Hotel Jefe.</p>
<p>Mr. Schorr estimated that “28 percent of the state of Nevada and 18.7 percent of the United States identify as Latino,” expressing his vision for this “one-of-a-kind property” to cater to the needs of this “massive, yet underserved population.” He also detailed that as part of the renovation, the restaurant, as well as the sportsbook and sports bar will be sharing “one layout,” all tailored to serving the large local Latino and Hispanic communities. This would greatly help in making Ojos Locos Sports Cantina y Casino at Hotel Jefe culturally feel like a place of their own.</p>
<p>What Will Be on Offer</p>
<p>The news release also cited Rich Hicks, Ojos Locos CEO, who outlined that one key component of this renovation and rebrand is the partnership between FSG and Ojos Locos Sports Cantina – the Dallas-based sports bar chain, saying that it’s an “extension of what we formed our business foundation on”. The Ojos Locos Sports Cantina y Casino at Hotel Jefe will be consisting of a restaurant part, offering a 250-person capacity, as well as a bar with a 40-person capacity.</p>
<p>The completion of the renovation and rebranding will give birth to the very first Nevada location for the sports bar chain. This is also the first time a company is launching a gaming and hospitality establishment specifically catered to the Latino market, however with FSG’s more than 15 years of experience in full-service hospitality and casino management, and now with the Ojos Locos partnership, the hundreds of customers that the property can hold will be undoubtedly very well taken care of.</p>
<p>Of course, renovations aren’t concerning only the restaurant and bar, as a nightclub will also be added to the entertainment menu. Other than that, rooms will be getting a makeover, and most importantly, more than 200 gaming machines will be added to the casino floor, as well. This would mean that the new vision for the future of this operation is – broadly speaking – an upgrade on all fronts, all targeted at specifically catering to the beloved Latino and Hispanic populations. And, of course, the renewed establishment will continue to host food festivals, Latino artists’ concerts, Mexican rodeos, and much more.</p>
