    <h1>Thunder Valley Casino Buffet Casino Atlanta Casino In Council Bluffs Iowa Native Lights Casino Casin</h1>

<p>The popular slot provider has teamed up with the audio production brand in the gambling industry to provide a new elevated experience for players and audiences</p>
<p>Moving forward, Play’n GO and MADLORD will work together to bring enhanced experiences for players. The idea behind the tie-up is to create what the companies have described as “elevated immersion” and more entertainment value for Play’n GO’s slot games.</p>
<p>The Sound of Video Slots with MADLORD</p>
<p>MADLORD already has 15 years of expertise and experience in creating music for video slot games, coming up with entire sound design patterns, and implementing audio in a seamless way. This partnership with Play’n GO will allow the company to deliver new and groundbreaking slot games that feel and play entirely differently.</p>
<p>In fact, the partnership sets out to achieve a very ambitious goal by taking on console video game titles directly, the two companies shared in a press release. MADLORD has already developed fantastic sound themes for a number of established games, including Dragon’s Myth, Castle Builder I, and Forsaken Kingdom, among others. Now, this experience will be carried over to Play’n GO’s own outstanding titles and future releases.</p>
<p>Play’n GO is quite the busy manufacturer as well, as the company pushes out 50 new slots a year, with MADLORD now assisting with many of the future releases. The partnership between the two companies focuses on innovation, imagination, and artistry, which are cherished by players as well as the partners.</p>
<p>Building the Sound of the Future</p>
<p>Play’n GO head of audio Walter Scharold welcomed the opportunity to be working with an innovator such as MADLORD describing the company as an entity that has a distinct outside-the-box approach towards slots audio design.</p>
<p>“MADLORD’s unique vision and versatility align perfectly with Play’n GO’s vision to be the best provider of iGaming content in the world,” Scharold. MADLORD commander and founder Jorge De Lellis was similarly excited to have this opportunity and incorporate its emblematic audio patterns, themes, and original bespoke work into Play’n GO’s products.</p>
<p>“This partnership will allow us to unleash our creativity and explore our maddest, most innovative ideas, fueled by our shared burning desire to propel video slot entertainment to new and unprecedented heights,” De Lellis concluded.</p>
