    <h1>Caesars Casino Indiana Casino Boat Pulse Online Casino Boombet Casino Casino Pittsburgh True Blue Ca</h1>

<p>I am stuck on proving my residency in Australia.</p>
<p>This is completely and utterly ridiculous. This is the first, the one and the ONLY casino that is making me jump through hoops for AU$750.</p>
<p>Now here is the really stupid part.... I get told one thing, and then another.</p>
<p>I have been told that a utility bill would be enough to prove my residency. So I have sent a Utility Bill that has my name and address on it.</p>
<p>BUT THEN..... I get told that the ONLY way is to send my Citizenship Certificate and/or Australian Passport.</p>
<p>I have lost my certificate and it is too expensive to replace it. I have never left Australia since my arrival in 1999, therefore have not needed a passport.</p>
<p>Just for the record, there are certain Government things that you cannot apply for unless you ARE a resident or citizen of Australia.</p>
<p>Some other good examples are, Medicare, Welfare,Voting Registration, Australian TAX number.</p>
<p>I would not have any Government asssistance, if I had NOT been able to prove my residency.</p>
<p>But NO! True Blue obviously loves taking advantage of gambling addicts. Loves taking the money from its customers. So greedy that they don't like paying out any winners, no matter how big or small the winnings.</p>
<p>They think that if they stall long enough, the customers will most likely just say "F@#K IT - the casino can keep it and they can kiss my A** too".</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>
