<p>Newcastle are only a step away from qualifying for the first League Cup final since 1976. In the first leg of the 2022-23 EFL Cup semifinal, they defeated Southampton 1-0 on the road. This Tuesday, they need to get the job done – anything but a loss at St. James’ Park would mean the Magpies are going to Wembley in February.</p>

<p>Newcastle Ready to Make History</p>
<p>At the moment, Newcastle are playing their best soccer since the start of the 21st century. They’re flying really high in the Premier League, while in the EFL Cup, they’re very close to booking the ticket to the final. If they do it, it’s going to be their first final in this competition since 1976.</p>
<p>Right now, it seems they’re almost certain to do so. They got a 1-0 lead on aggregate, which means that if they don’t lose to Newcastle on the last day of January, they’re going to get to the EFL Cup final.</p>
<p>Knowing that they’re superb on their turf, it’s very likely we’ll see them play against the winner of the other semifinal (Manchester United vs Nottingham Forest) in the final. The Magpies are without a single loss at home since April 2022. This season, their home record in all competitions is 11-5-0.</p>
<p>It’s Premier League Southampton Need to Worry About</p>
<p>Southampton are bottom of the table in the Premier League with just 15 points after 20 rounds. Their record is 4-3-13 with a score differential of 17-35 in the league. The good news is that they got a chance to get away from the bottom in February. They’re just two points away from Wolves, the closest team from the safe zone.</p>
<p>For that, however, they need to focus entirely on the Prem. That said, they might not be willing to all in against Newcastle. After all, the Saints probably understand that knocking the Magpies out of the EFL Cup is close to a mission impossible.</p>
<p>Newcastle vs Southampton Carabao Cup Prediction</p>
<p>Newcastle is going to take this game very seriously. They have a chance to achieve something they haven’t done in nearly 50 years. We’re 100% certain they’re going to do it. It’s not just that they’re motivated to win, but their players are also way better than those playing for Southampton.</p>
<p>Pick: Newcastle to win to nil; under 2.5 goals</p>
