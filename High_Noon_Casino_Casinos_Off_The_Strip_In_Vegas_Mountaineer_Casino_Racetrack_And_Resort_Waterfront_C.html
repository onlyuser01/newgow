<p>B2B gaming supplier Push Gaming announces an expansion of its global content partnership with LeoVegas after a successful year.</p>
<p>Content Association Renewal between Two Gaming Leaders</p>
<p>Casino games provider Push Gaming has reinforced its international deals by extending its contract with multiple award-winning operator LeoVegas.</p>
<p>The agreement allows LeoVegas to incorporate titles like Joker Troupe, Jammin’ Jars and the company’s most recent arrival at time of publishing, Wheel of Wonders, using the Push Gaming platform under UKGC and MGA license.</p>
<p>As Push Gaming is getting more and more popular in recent years, this partnership is a significant indicator of the supplier’s global leadership position, more specifically in popular European market such as the UK, Sweden and Germany through the LeoVegas, GoGo Casino and Rocket X trademarks.</p>
<p>“Our slots are enjoyed so much by our players precisely because we put entertainment at the heart of everything we do – we look forward to continuing our already-successful partnership together across multiple regions,” stated Fiona Hickey, Head of Sales at Push Gaming.</p>
<p>Hickey shared his excitement to keep working with an industry leader that provides “top quality content” and that has such a broad reach.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, Johan Ekberg, Group Casino Games Manager at LeoVegas said the company “looks forward taking this content agreement to the next level.” He continued:</p>
<p>“Push Gaming’s catalogue of titles delights with every spin, and we’re very happy to be extending our provision of their content with a direct integration into our casino lobbies.”</p>
<p>A Rewarding Year for the Gambling Industry</p>
<p>Both companies are delighted to focus on building a productive business relationship in the years to come, as 2020 already was a stepping-stone for gambling companies.</p>
<p>Besides purchasing its own fully-licensed platform via GSI (Game Server Integrations), Push Gaming has also entered into an impressive series of leading global agreements, among them are alliances with William Hill, GVC, The Rank Group, and EveryMatrix, a recent partnership allowing the latter to gain access to well-received Push Gaming titles like Mystery Museum, in order to attract a more diverse player base.</p>
<p>This wide range of international partners are part of Push Gaming’s commitment to create highly entertaining content. For its part, the Swedish betting and gaming operator ensures its continuity and prosperity by offering open banking payment solutions to its clients.</p>
<p>First enabled in the UK, the payment solution enables to increase the security and speed of payments and dramatically lowers transaction costs and dependency on external suppliers.</p>
