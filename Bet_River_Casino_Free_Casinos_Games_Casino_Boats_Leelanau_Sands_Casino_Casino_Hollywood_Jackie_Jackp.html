    <h1>Bet River Casino Free Casinos Games Casino Boats Leelanau Sands Casino Casino Hollywood Jackie Jackp</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I am writing to you today to discuss an issue I am having with Jackie Jackpot casino.</p>
<p>I discovered Jackie Jackpot casino through your website as it was labelled as a popular and trusted casino with great reviews.</p>
<p>I registered for an account through their website and then proceeded to deposit $200.00 CAD using Interac E-transfer, I also accepted the welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, my deposit was accepted, so I started playing their slot machines. I landed several bonuses and managed to win $5400.00 CAD.</p>
<p>I've been trying to withdrawal my winnings for the last week, but the casino was giving me a difficult time with the verification process. Whenever I asked why my identity was rejected, I did not receive an answer. I've used the same ID and image file to verify myself on other online casinos, so it shouldn't be an issue with this casino.</p>
<p>This morning, I woke up to an email I did not want to see. This is what it said:</p>
<p>"Dear Mr/Ms Jordan,</p>
<p>We are contacting you in regards to your pending withdrawal of CAD 5400 on your JackieJackpot account.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are unable to process your current pending withdrawal, this is due to our terms and conditions outlined below and within the bonus policy</p>
<p>â€¢ If you place a wager using only your bonus funds, and win, you will receive, depending on your chosen account currency, up to a maximum of C$500 in winnings. If your winnings exceed C$500 you will only receive CAD 500.</p>
<p>Kindly note that the withdrawable funds of C$500 are available on your account balance for you to withdraw.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>JackieJackpot"</p>
<p>This clause was never indicated upon taking the bonus. I also played through all the wagering requirements after earning my winnings.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm being taken advantage of here and I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated with Jackie Jackpot.</p>
<p>I am hoping we can find a resolution so I can withdrawal my winnings.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
