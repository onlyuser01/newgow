<p>Powered by IGT PlaySports, the lottery will continue to offer mobile sports betting statewide and retail betting at Bally's Twin River Lincoln and Tiverton Casinos</p>
<p>Global supplier of gaming and lottery solutions International Game Technology (IGT) announced its sports betting technology contract with the Rhode Island Lottery has been extended for another three years.</p>
<p>The Beneficial Partnership Will Continue</p>
<p>The contract extension with the Rhode Island Lottery means that IGT will continue to provide the IGT PlaySports solution alongside its commercial partner, William Hill US, and power the lottery’s sports betting offering via the Sportsbook Rhode Island app and the sportsbooks at Bally’s Twin River Lincoln Casino Resort and Bally’s Tiverton Casino &amp; Hotel.</p>
<p>Mark Furcolo, Rhode Island Lottery director, commented on the contract extension, expressing the lottery’s contentment with the partnership with IGT and William Hill in the past five years that proved successful for the lottery’s sports betting operation, hailing “IGT’s world-class technology and William Hill’s operator experience.”</p>
<p>“IGT recently invested significant resources to enhance our sports betting platform and mobile app,” he continued in his comments, stressing that these upgrades will empower the Rhode Island Lottery “to maximize revenue and offer a solution that remains competitive among neighboring states” in what is a very dynamic regional sports betting market.</p>
<p>On behalf of IGT, the company’s president of Sports Betting, Joe Asher, outlined that the Rhode Island Lottery was “one of the early adopters [of sports betting] in the post-PASPA era,” championing the vertical in 2018, noting that IGT was more than happy to be able “to continue driving Rhode Island’s sports betting growth.”</p>
<p>“Rhode Island is home to very loyal sports fans who love following their New England-based teams,” Asher added, highlighting that the “enhancements IGT has made to the Lottery’s sports betting platform and app” would help the lottery operator “provide fans with a convenient and intuitive player experience” while yielding “strong returns that support the Lottery’s commitment to generating revenue for good causes.”</p>
<p>Lottery, iLottery, Instant Tickets, Video Lottery</p>
<p>The contract extension further strengthens the partnership between the tech supplier and the lottery operator, in which IGT is the exclusive supplier of lottery, iLottery, instant tickets and video lottery solutions and services to the Rhode Island Lottery.</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, IGT and the Rhode Island Lottery signed a 20-year extension to their partnership contract under which IGT would remain the lottery’s exclusive supplier of these lottery and iLottery products and services until 2043.</p>
<p>IGT PlaySports is currently available across more than 80 gaming venues in the US and Canada, with the latest to benefit from the sports betting platform being the Santa Ana Star Casino Hotel in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Under the contract with the Pueblo of Santa Ana tribe, IGT agreed to deliver its platform and self-service betting kiosks and provide trading advisory services for the casino partner operators.</p>
