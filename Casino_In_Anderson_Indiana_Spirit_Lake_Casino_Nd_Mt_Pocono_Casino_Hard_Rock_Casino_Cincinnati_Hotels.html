    <h1>Casino In Anderson Indiana Spirit Lake Casino Nd Mt Pocono Casino Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati Hotels</h1>

<p>I played above og casino with registration onus without deposit. As with many casinos, I also had to implement a certain sum here until I had the opportunity to withdraw some. When I was ready, I wanted to be paid 400.00 â‚¬. Today (05.11.2019) I got an email that my payout was rejected.</p>
<p>Then I contacted via the chat of the website and they told me that I had played "forbidden games".</p>
<p>On my question where to read which games are prohibited, I was referred to the terms, but there was nothing about which games are excluded from the bonus balance and which are not.</p>
<p>Not even if you choose a game is pointed out.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me there.</p>
<p>With best regards</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
