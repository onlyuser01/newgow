    <h1>Casino In Central City Big Fish Casino Facebook Casino Road Maverick Casino Elko Casino Arizona Phot</h1>

<p>Chips.gg claims I made a ton of "value bets" and have only allowed me to withdraw 750USDT of my balance. There are still around 1300USDT left and they say I would need to 10X in turnover because some of the bets were "value bets" as they claim.</p>
<p>In this case, I was trying to withdraw another 600USDT and they say I would have to wager about 6k USDT to proceed.</p>
<p>So far, no evidence of "value betting" was given, no KYC was asked, there was just a cap imposed on my withdraw limit.</p>
<p>Live support agent says he will get back to me when he gets answers from the sportsbook team.</p>
