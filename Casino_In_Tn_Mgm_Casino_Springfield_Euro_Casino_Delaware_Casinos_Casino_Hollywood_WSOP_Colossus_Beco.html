<p>WSOP Colossus Becomes Largest Live Poker Tournament Ever</p>

<p>The World Series of Poker’s inaugural “Colossus” tournament has, as expected, smashed all the records to become the biggest live poker tournament ever staged.</p>
<p>Twenty-two thousand three hundred and seventy-four players turned out over the course of four Day 1 flights to play in the event, beating the previous WSOP record, the 2006 Main Event, by (calculator out) 13,601 players.</p>
<p>The event represents a strategic departure for the WSOP and Caesars as the festival now has the additional aim of boosting the numbers at WSOP.com.</p>
<p>Thus, this year’s Series is fully geared to attract the “right” sort of player, and lots of them: the kind of player who might be attracted to multi-table a few cash games or tournaments with low to mid-level buy-ins while they’re in town.</p>
<p>The Colossus is a case in point.</p>
<p>With its affordable buy-in of $565, and tantalizing $5 million guaranteed prize pool, it was designed to paper the house with players.</p>
<p>The WSOP is peppered with large-field, low buy-in events this year, and even includes an online bracelet tournament.</p>
<p>Mobiles at the Table</p>
<p>For the first time, players will be permitted to bring their mobile devices to the tables to play online during WSOP events.</p>
<p>Caesars convinced the Nevada Gaming Control Board to waive its one-player-per-IP-address rule, meaning that the Rio and all other Caesars properties will be whitelisted and exempted from the rule throughout the duration of the Series.</p>
<p>Last year, WSOP.com cash game traffic rose 24 percent in the first week of the Series alone, which means it’s likely to be even higher this year. Industry number-cruncher, PokerScout.com has conservatively suggested that the spike will be at least 50 percent.</p>
<p>Not all the players were happy with the payout structure of the Colossus, however, and many eyebrows were raised by the announcement of the first-place prize of $638,880, which represents just under six percent of the prize pool, considerably smaller than the average tournament.</p>
<p>“Democratic” Payout Structure</p>
<p>But this was part of the plan; a flat payout structure that could reward as many players as possible, with 2,241, or around ten percent of the field, making the money.</p>
<p>Top heavy payout structures are the norm, and in general that is designed to reward the skillful player with an edge on the field. This was poker with a far more “democratic” distribution of wealth in mind, designed to keep the mid-level player happy.</p>
<p>“When you see a crowd that could fill many sports venues, there’s not much else you can say,” WSOP executive director Ty Stewart said in a statement. “We want to thank everyone who traveled from near and far to be part of this historic event, particularly the first timers.</p>
<p>Just like the sign says, ‘We Hope You Come Back Soon.’ We love to bring poker enthusiasts together and help build positive momentum for the game.”</p>
