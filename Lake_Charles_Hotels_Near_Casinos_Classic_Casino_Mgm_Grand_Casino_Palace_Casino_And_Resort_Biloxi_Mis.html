<p>The Book of Amaterasu review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot has an East Asian theme.</p>
<p>Players wander into a breezy spring day complete with cherry blossoms. After meeting the Japanese goddess of the sun, Amaterasu, players will face a reel of coins, waterlilies, and playful cats.</p>
<p>This game is a good choice for players looking for a tranquil atmosphere. The calming aesthetic is perfect for unwinding, though players looking for drama may wish to keep looking.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The idyllic tune sets the mood of an optimistic early morning with plenty of tinkling notes. The music reinforces the calming tone of the game, but players may mute it if they prefer this option.</p>
<p>The symbols include pink water lilies that are animated to sway as if a gentle wind is blowing. A waving lucky cat also appears on the reels, smiling warmly at the players. His cute face is especially welcoming and he adds a reassuring presence.</p>
<p>The most striking symbol is the goddess Amaterasu, adorned with a golden headdress, earrings and striking red makeup. She is the most prominent symbol, breaking the confines of her reel. She is animated to blink, making her seem more alive.</p>
<p>The backdrop behind the reels is a natural scene with cherry trees, a waterfall, a temple, and a chilly blue sky. This landscape gives a sense of a foreign location and contributes to the relaxing atmosphere.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics and animation create an immersive game world that is consistent with the theme.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Book of Amaterasu is a five reel, three row slot, with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>The Gamble feature is available after every spin whether or not the player has won. This feature allows the player to bet their current win, immediately entering the Free Spins feature or buying into the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. The Wild symbol also functions as a Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>If players land at least 3 Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature will be triggered. The feature will start with 10 free spins in case of landing 3 Scatters, 15 spins if players land 4 Scatter symbols, or with 25 should they land 5 Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>Players will play their free spins at the bet they had when the feature was triggered.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature may be retriggered.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.0%, below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€20.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility East Asian-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though the animation is beautiful, this game cannot quite overcome its low RTP.</p>
<p>The ample volatility is also an upside, but strategy-conscious players will still likely wish to pursue games with a more favourable RTP.</p>
<p>This game may be worth stopping by for a look, but it is not hard to understand why it has remained low in popularity.</p>
