<p>Pragmatic Play continues to grow its presence in the Italian iGaming market, through the signing of a fresh content alliance with a prominent local operator.</p>
<p>The latest opportunity to move forward in the highly lucrative jurisdiction is facilitated through a partnership with Sportbet, an operator with an established track record in the country.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Launches Live Casino Games with Sportbet</p>
<p>Sportbet’s position in Italy will allow Pragmatic Play to inject its variety of cutting-edge games and deliver them to fresh audiences. Furthermore, Pragmatic Play is interested in growing both its partner operators and its audiences in Italy.</p>
<p>The partnership focuses particularly on the live casino content that Pragmatic Play develops in-house. As a result, players will be able to benefit from a number of fantastic titles, to name Mega Wheel, Boom City, Sweet Bonanza, PowerUP Roulette, and so much more.</p>
<p>More games will be coming as the two companies seek to consolidate their partnership and bring even better options to players. Pragmatic Play is also very keen to grow its footprint in the country as well as across the European continent.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides hailed the latest alliance and said that adding another “up-and-coming” business to the company’s network of operators was precisely what Pragmatic Play had in mind for the Italian market and well across the continent. She said:</p>
<p>Europe is well established as a key region in our growth strategy, and we look forward to providing Sportbet with some of the best Live Casino content on the market. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>Sportbet casino manager Alessandro Palumbo was similarly pleased with the development and noted that Pragmatic Play’s Live Casino portfolio was definitely something that was worth adding to the operator’s portfolio of options.</p>
<p>Palumbo said that Pragmatic Play was a well-known supplier and that its products were always welcome as part of any casino’s offering. Therefore, Palumbo was happy that Sportbet was able to secure these titles and introduce them to the operator’s local crowds.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been pushing steadily across the European market, as the company vowed to do earlier in the year. Part of Pragmatic’s most recent deals includes a content partnership with mycasino in Switzerland and Whow Games in Germany.</p>
<p>For its part, Sportbet has been expanding quickly in the regulated iGaming sector, after placing its initial focus on the sports betting vertical but now seeking to consolidate its presence in other verticals as well.</p>
