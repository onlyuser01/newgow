<p>As part of the deal, Push Gaming will provide Kindred with exclusivity on its latest slot game</p>
<p>Push Gaming, a leading B2B gaming supplier, has announced an expansion of its partnership with Kindred Group plc, one of the top-tier operators in the industry.</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s Crystal Catcher Launches Exclusively with Kindred in Dutch Market</p>
<p>This partnership marks a significant commercial step forward for Push Gaming in the Dutch market, where its entire portfolio of games will now be available to Kindred’s customers. Popular titles like Giga Jar, Retro Tapes, Big Bamboo, Jammin’ Jars, and Razor Shark are just a few of the games that will be available to Dutch players.</p>
<p>Crystal Catcher, Push Gaming’s newest slot game, will be available exclusively to Kindred customers across all markets for a period of three months. The game incorporates a unique feature of a moving wild multiplier that increases wins during the base game and activates the free spins round. During the free spins round, multipliers remain in place, elevating the chances of winning big. After the three-month exclusivity period with Kindred Group, Crystal Catcher will become available to the wider network from June 20.</p>
<p>The exclusivity of Crystal Catcher will boost Push Gaming’s prominence across Kindred brands globally while also supporting its growth in the key Dutch market. The deal exemplifies Push Gaming’s continued expansion across regulated markets with additional partnerships scheduled in the coming months.</p>
<p>Push Gaming Director of New Business and Markets Highlights the Importance of the Partnership</p>
<p>Fiona Hickey, director of new business and markets for Push Gaming, has stated that the partnership with Kindred is highly significant, as Kindred is considered one of the top names in the industry, providing Push Gaming with unmatched market reach in the Netherlands and across Europe.</p>
<p>Hickey further added: “Equally noteworthy is our allocation of Crystal Catcher on an exclusive basis, which isn’t something we choose to offer lightly, such is the stature of this collaboration. We are thrilled to be evolving our relationship with Kindred.”</p>
<p>As per Gareth Jennings, head of a casino for Kindred Group, Push Gaming consistently produces top-notch content that is synonymous with its platform. Additionally, Jennings noted that the opportunity to offer Push Gaming’s latest game, Crystal Catcher, on an exclusive basis demonstrates its commitment to providing exceptional content to its customers. Push Gaming has been expanding its presence in key European markets such as the UK, while also making strides in new territories such as Belgium, where the company agreed to provide its content to 777 Belgium, and Italy.</p>
