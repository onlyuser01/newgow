<p>SaharaBets has picked PayNearMe’s MoneyLine solution as its new payment settlement option. The solution enables players to make deposits and withdrawals to and from the sports betting platform. Consumers in Arizona may now pick this payment option to settle bets, whether they wish to top up their accounts or withdraw from their balances.</p>
<p>SaharaBets Adds PayNearMe’s MoneyLine</p>
<p>SaharaBets president Andrew Patterson welcomed this opportunity and said that the company strives to deliver the best possible experience to consumers. This starts with the payment options available.</p>
<p>As a result, SaharaBets will continue offering improved payment options for its customers as they seek to minimize wait times and enjoy access to immediate transactions. Patterson added:</p>
<p>With MoneyLine, our players can access their funds instantly, significantly upgrading their player experience. SaharaBets president Andrew Patterson</p>
<p>The executive is confident that expanding the number of available payment methods is the way to onboard more consumers and make payment onboarding seamless. This is true, as PayNearMe claims that its MoneyLine solution will ensure that consumers are more readily depositing into sportsbooks.</p>
<p>In a recent iGaming study, the company found out that 29% of US players already complained that depositing takes too long. Another 39% said that withdrawals were slow, and the company even observed that there is a lack of popular payment methods that are often a go-to option for consumers only to find out those are not supported.</p>
<p>PayNearMe VP and general manager Leighton Webb explained that payments impact consumer experience, as the majority of participants want to enjoy quick banking altogether. Webb added:</p>
<p>With PayNearMe, operators can deliver on players’ expectations and increase the speed of payouts so that funds are available in minutes rather than days. PayNearMe VP and general manager Leighton Webb</p>
<p>SaharaBets has taken heed of PayNearMe’s recommendations and plans to roll out a number of other trusted payment platforms, including Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, and others.</p>
