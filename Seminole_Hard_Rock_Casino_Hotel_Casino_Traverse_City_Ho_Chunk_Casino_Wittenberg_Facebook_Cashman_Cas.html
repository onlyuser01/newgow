<p>Gaming Innovation Group or GiG has revealed that it has accomplished a new regulator milestone by receiving a license to operate in Ontario as the company received a license to provide services as a B2B sportsbook and player account management (PAM) supplier in the Canadian province.</p>
<p>GiG Makes Entry into Ontario</p>
<p>The company has been cleared by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario and has become the latest entity to enter the highly-competitive private gaming market in the country. As a reminder, Ontario launched its iGaming and private sports betting industries on April 4 this year and since then, there have been dozens of new entrants.</p>
<p>GiG has taken some time to join the rest of the companies in the market, marking expansion into the 22nd jurisdiction worldwide. GiG is also set to expand in more markets as it currently pursues regulatory approvals in other places. Commenting on this launch, GiG general counsel Claudio Caruana welcomed the opportunity and thanked the regulator for finding the company as worth joining the market.</p>
<p>Caruana said that GiG was committed to supporting regulated gambling entities in each market it operates in, with companies in Ontario now free to reach out. GiG also said that it is expecting big things for the market, quoting an H2 Gambling Data study, arguing that the market will generate more than $2.1 billion over the next three years in terms of gross gaming revenue.</p>
<p>More Jurisdictions Covered by GiG</p>
<p>This should give the company a strong position to provide its platforms and iGaming solutions locally, ensuring that the company secures a fair share of this burgeoning and fast-evolving market. GiG is expanding rapidly across the globe with entries in Colombia, Portugal, and Spain, thanks to numerous partnerships secured through the Sportnco division.</p>
