<p>ESA Gaming, a B2B provider of innovative gaming content, has minted a new partnership agreement with Kiron Interactive. As a leading supplier and aggregator, the latter company will help ESA Gaming expand its presence in multiple markets.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Kiron will leverage its aggregation platform to launch its new partner’s games across many regulated jurisdictions. As a result, many more players will be able to enjoy ESA Gaming’s portfolio of popular games, which includes titles such as Goal Mine, Pirate Mine and FruitStaxx.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming offers a selection of non-traditional casino games that are designed to enhance cross-sell capabilities and sit in the space between casino gaming and sports betting.</p>
<p>Kiron, on the other hand, will enhance its aggregation portfolio, making its product offering even more appealing to gambling operators.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming’s Philosophy Corresponds to Kiron’s Vision</p>
<p>Steven Spartinos, co-chief executive officer at Kiron Interactive, praised the integration. He said that his team is dedicated to providing virtual sports products and numbers offerings that can serve as an “attractive alternative” to traditional sports wagering. According to Spartinos, ESA Gaming’s EasySwipe portfolio follows a similar philosophy and will likely appeal to “players looking for quick-resolution alternative betting experiences.”</p>
<p>Spartinos added that Kiron is looking to expand its list of valuable partners ad concluded that his company is excited about the future.</p>
<p>We’re expanding the number of partners who are leveraging our experience and insight, and this agreement with ESA Gaming has huge positives for both parties. We’re excited for what the future holds for us both globally. Steven Spartinos, co-CEO, Kiron Interactive</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ESA Gaming’s head of marketing, Thomas Smallwood, praised Kiron Interactive for its “phenomenal reach in key target jurisdictions.” Smallwood said that his team is delighted to join forces with the aggregator and supply content to its partnering operators.</p>
<p>We’re confident that our EasySwipe™ titles can add real value alongside Kiron’s award-winning offering and look forward to providing new player experiences across the globe. Thomas Smallwood, head of marketing, ESA Gaming</p>
<p>ESA Gaming continues to enjoy steady growth and, over the past few months, managed to launch content in a number of key jurisdictions. The supplier’s games are currently available to players in Europe, Latin America and Africa.</p>
<p>Two months ago, ESA Gaming also expanded its presence in Italy, launching content with Octavian Lab. This followed another Italy-facing deals with Betflag and NetBet.</p>
