<p>In an official statement, the CEO of state-owned Svenska Spel, Patrik Hofbauer, called for a national debt register and regulations on fast loans</p>
<p>Hofbauer made a review of the goals Svenska Spel has set for the new year with a main focus on tackling problem gambling and lowering the effects of gambling harm.</p>
<p>Hofbauer Outlined Several Measures to Fight Gambling Harm in 2023 and Beyond</p>
<p>In the official statement addressing customers of Svenska Spel and Swedes in general, Hofbauer referred back to 2022 and tried to outline what Svenska Spel will strive to achieve in 2023.</p>
<p>One of the most significant topics Hofbauer highlighted was the fight against gambling harm with several measures that he discussed in the statement.</p>
<p>Probably the most notable was Hofbauer’s demand for a national debt register and stronger state protection against people taking out loans they cannot afford. He called for a system similar to the self-exclusion program Spelpaus, which will allow individuals to have a “lending break” and be protected against quick loans and advertising from lending companies.</p>
<p>In this regard, Hofbauer underlined that gambling addiction is usually financed through quick loans, which often leads to personal and family tragedies. Such debts remain even when the gambler manages to successfully deal with his or her gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Another major commitment of Svenska Spel that Hofbauer announced was the allocation of an additional SEK 42 million ($4 million) to Swedish gambling research over the next five years. Hofbauer noted that evidence-based research has helped Svenska Spel counteract risky gambling and the effects of gambling harm in the best possible way and is integral to the understanding of the gambling habits of gambling addicts and risky gamblers.</p>
<p>Hofbauer also touched upon the expected developments in 2023 in terms of tackling match-fixing, Svenska Spel’s collaboration with ATG and Kindred regarding transparently reporting key performance indicators on how gambling companies deal with customers who show signs of risky gambling, and more.</p>
<p>Ola Enquist Was Appointed as CEO of Casino Cosmopol</p>
<p>Another major announcement from Svenska Spel at the beginning of 2023 was that Ola Enquist has been appointed as the CEO of the Svenska Spel-owned Casino Cosmopol.</p>
<p>Enquist will be a member of Svenska Spel’s senior management and will report directly to Svenska Spel CEO Patrik Hofbauer. He will take up his new position no later than June 2023.</p>
<p>Enquist is coming from First Camp, one of Scandinavia’s largest camping companies where he is currently Chief Operating Officer. There, he has helped build the business with a focus on customer service and operations. Among his responsibilities are concepts, product offerings, guest experience, and employee satisfaction. Before that, Enquist had many years of experience in senior positions within Circle K in Sweden, including Senior Director of Retail Operations.</p>
