<p>The partnership focuses on the collaboration between the LKF and Betsafe, the group-owned sports betting brand in the country.</p>
<p>The partnership focuses on supporting the country’s basketball men’s team with the brand continuing as the main sponsor of the national team. LTU Basketball president Vydas Gedvilas welcomed the collaboration and its significance, saying that Betsafe and men’s basketball in the country have been collaborating successfully since 2010 when the partnership was introduced on the occasion of the FIBA World Cup.</p>
<p>Lithuania’s Basketball Team Carries On with Trusted Partnership with Betsafe</p>
<p>“Throughout these years we‘ve enjoyed a number of great victories, and in the future, I have no doubt, we will win many more victories together,” Gedvilas added. The collaboration was naturally welcomed by Betsafe managing director Aurimas Šilys who was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that it was a great honor to continue supporting Lithuanian basketball and the Lithuanian Basketball Federation. Šilys added:</p>
<p>LKF is our strategic partner in Lithuania and basketball is in the heart of every Lithuanian, so we are happy that the organization is growing and developing with our help. Betsafe managing director Aurimas Šilys</p>
<p>The Lithuanian basketball men’s team is heading for the FIBA Basketball World Cup which will take place from August 25 through September 15 in Asia. The team is also qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris. Lithuanian men’s national team head Kazys Maksvytis was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see the partnership enter yet another stage and continue to the benefit of the team itself and its fans.</p>
<p>Focusing on Raising Awareness Through Partnership Building</p>
<p>Betsafe and Betsson have also been working on ways to ensure that their offer is continuously improving, and they have featured Neccton’s solution as part of the core platform. This way players can make informed decisions about their gambling habits and trigger an intervention by the operator if they are exceeding the reasonable amount of play.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Betsson has been actively seeking sponsorships with established and trusted partners and clubs. A few weeks ago, the company grew its presence in the Latin American region by thickening its ties with Racing Club de Avellaneda for the upcoming 2023/2024 soccer season in Argentina.</p>
<p>The company has been seeking to increase awareness of its products and offers through strategic partnerships with prominent sports teams and organizations.</p>
