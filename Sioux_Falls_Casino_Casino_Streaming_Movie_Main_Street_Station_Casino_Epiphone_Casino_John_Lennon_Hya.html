<p>The industry leader in player retention solutions, Enteractive, announced it achieved a prestigious data security certification.</p>
<p>Enteractive Celebrates Security Certification Achievement</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the company announced that it has been awarded the Cyber Essentials Plus certification. The certification is a testament to the company’s trustworthiness in cyber security and comes after an extensive audit. Enteractive revealed that the audit was carried out in September this year and probed different company structures such as its information security management system.</p>
<p>Backed by the UK government, the Cyber Essentials Plus is a certification program that reaffirms an operator can withstand some of the most common cyber-attacks. Achieving the certification means that operators can keep their client’s data safe, which is significantly important within the growing regulated iGaming sector nowadays.</p>
<p>The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) both developed and operated the Cyber Essentials Plus program. It is famous for being the highest certification within the Cyber Essentials scheme. To achieve the aforementioned certification, each operator goes through rigorous testing by a team of cybersecurity experts.</p>
<p>The Certification Marks an Exciting Moment for the Company</p>
<p>Pedram Padidar, Enteractive’s COO, said that the recent certification reaffirms the success of the company’s dedicated IT team that worked tirelessly to ensure the protection of the clients’ data. Moreover, he said: “This is business critical for Enteractive, and we’re beyond proud to have yet another certification to illustrate our prowess in this area.”</p>
<p>“While Enteractive has only ever employed the most exacting approach to data security to ensure top level safety when our clients connect with us through our proprietary API tech, we also strive to achieve the highest level of third-party accreditation to qualify our ability to protect the digital environments in which we operate.“ Daniel Schembri, CTO at Enteractive</p>
<p>Daniel Schembri, Enteractive’s CTO, added that a key priority for the company is to ensure the protection of clients’ data within the industry the company operates in. In conclusion, he pointed out that the certification reaffirms that Enteractive remains a leader when it comes to digital security within the continuously growing online vertical.</p>
<p>The company’s latest announcement comes after late last month, it unveiled its entry into Pennsylvania. This helped Enteractive expand its reach and marked the third US state entry for the leading retention solutions specialist. The entry into the regulated market in the state came after the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board allowed Enteractive to launch its services. This enabled the company to provide its leading services for partners in the state.</p>
