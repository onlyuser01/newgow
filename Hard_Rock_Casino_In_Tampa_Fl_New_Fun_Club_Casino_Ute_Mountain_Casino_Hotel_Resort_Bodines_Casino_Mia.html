<p>Sports betting in Tennessee has generated $312.3 million over the first two months of operation with the mobile-only sector proving a success.</p>
<p>Sports Betting in Tennessee Posts Solid Results</p>
<p>Tennessee is posting solid sports betting revenue, driven by its mobile-only industry which has collected $312.3 million in gross bets over the past two months, its first months of operation.</p>
<p>So far, officials have collected $5.4 million in tax, based on the numbers revealed by the Tennessee Lottery on Tuesday. Out of these numbers, some $180.9 million in total wagers were generated in December, with $167 million paid back out to sports fans and $3.1 million scooped up in tax.</p>
<p>The numbers are better across the board month-over-month and regulators expect to see even better results in January, as the month is a precursor to the Super Bowl. Then, the March Madness contests in February and March, and some of April, should drive steady results as well.</p>
<p>Presently, the state credits 80% of all tax revenue to education and backs postsecondary scholarships. Another 15% is sent to cover local government needs, with 5% earmarked for the treatment of problem gambling in the state.</p>
<p>As results keep climbing up, the Lottery is hoping to introduce at least three more licenses before the Super Bowl action kicks off, says CEO Rebecca Hargrove in a Tuesday Statement. This gives the regulator and stakeholders fewer than six days to apply and approve new operators in the state.</p>
<p>At present terms of development, Tennessee is expecting to generate some $50 million in total tax revenue a year, which will help it chip away at state deficit and bolster ailing finances in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Even though sports betting was hard to legalize at first, facing fairly stern opposition, a bill was finally signed into law by Gov. Bill Lee, but it took until late 2020 to see the first online operators launch their products.</p>
