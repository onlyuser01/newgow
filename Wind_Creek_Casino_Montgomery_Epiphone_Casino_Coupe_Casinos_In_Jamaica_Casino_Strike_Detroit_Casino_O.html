<p>Bigger Bass Blizzard: Christmas Catch review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Bigger Bass Blizzard: Christmas Catch is themed around a festive fishing trip.</p>
<p>With a cup of coco in hand, players will head out onto the ice to try their luck at ice fishing. If they can stay warm all day, they might just bring back a few fish for dinner.</p>
<p>Fans of the Big Bass franchise will get in the holiday spirit with this wintery interpretation of the popular slot theme.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The festive tune blends sleigh bells and seagull cries for a unique Christmas fishing trip feel. The reels spin with a cheery bubbling sound that helps create a watery atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the reels, players may notice some familiar symbols such as a tackle box, an adorable baby fish, and a colorful fishing rod. A snowmobile charging through the snow also makes an appearance, coming to life upon wins.</p>
<p>The animation leans into a cartoon aesthetic that makes for an uplifting vibe. Brightly colored letters add a splash of fun to the reels as well.</p>
<p>Of course, the titular bass fish also appears, leaping out of the water and ready to bite a hook. The blend of hues on his scales bring to mind a watercolor painting.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, there is an idyllic winter landscape of ice and snowy evergreens. It seems like the ideal location to spend a holiday afternoon.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create an entertaining wintery twist on the familiar fishing trip theme.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol appears on all the reels during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>The Money symbol takes on a randomly selected value during each spin. The possible values include 2x, 5x, 10x, 15x, 20x, 25x, 50x, and 400x the player’s total bet. Paying fish symbols also function as Money symbols.</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature begins. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of Scatters that triggered the feature as follows:</p>
<p>If players land 2 Scatters during the base game, they will be given a special chance to acquire a third Scatter as a special hook appears.</p>
<p>For the duration of the Free Spins feature, Wild symbols collect the values of all Money symbols. Each Wild is collected and saved until the end of the feature, and for every fourth Wild, players are awarded 10 additional free spins, retriggering the feature.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature can be retriggered a maximum of three times.</p>
<p>At random during the Free Spins feature, 1-2 special hooks can appear to award Wild and Money symbols.</p>
<p>When there are only 1 or 2 Wilds on the reels at the end of a free spin, fish Money symbols can appear in random positions.</p>
