<p>Prophet Exchange, a P2P sport betting exchange provider based in the United States, has tapped Joseph Caputi as its new director of compliance. Caputi brings a wealth of experience that will help Prophet Exchange better navigate the often-complicated context of regulation in the country’s fast-developing betting industry.</p>
<p>Caputi is a member of the New Jersey Bar Association, and he has stepped down from his position at Duane Morris LLP, a law firm, to join Prophet Exchange. Dean Sisun, Prophet CEO and co-founder, is confident that the new hire is precisely what the company needs to continue evolving its product and expand its reach.</p>
<p>Welcome Hire and Confidence in the Future</p>
<p>According to Sisun, Caputi brings a solid understanding of industry policies and regulations. His nous of compliance and administrative processes will be of assistance to Prophet’s further development in the industry.</p>
<p>“Joseph’s legal and professional background make him a valuable addition to our growing team.” Prophet CEO and co-founder Dean Sisun</p>
<p>Caputi himself welcomed the news and said that he was thrilled to extend his career as part of the Prophet Exchange team.</p>
<p>“I gained significant industry expertise in my previous roles, and today I am honored to level my knowledge and expertise with an industry-shaking firm that centers its efforts in its customers.” Prophet Exchange director of compliance Joseph Caputi</p>
<p>Previously, the company brought on Joe Peta as a strategic advisor, who is the author of one of the best books about gambling: “Trading Bases: How a Wall Street Trader Made a Fortune Betting on Baseball.”</p>
<p>The company has been looking to secure an entry into New Jersey, having applied for a pre-registration in the Garden State in October and choosing to set up headquarters there in August. Prophet secured market access in New Jersey through a partnership with Caesars back in July.</p>
