<p>Bet McLean and Linfield FC have expanded their 10-year-old existing partnership with a new first team shirt and shorts branding deal</p>
<p>Northern Irish independent sportsbook with over 60 stores on the high street and a popular betting platform online, Bet McLean, has decided to continue its fruitful decade-old collaboration with Linfield FC, the popular Northern Irish professional soccer club that plays in the Northern Ireland Football League Championship Irish Premiership.</p>
<p>To mark the decision, the two parties agreed to print the Bet McLean branded logo on the first team shirt sleeve as well as on the team shorts. Even more, the sportsbook will have four promotional trackside signs in each of the club’s stands located at Windsor Park.</p>
<p>Linfield, “Pleased to Continue Working with Paul McLean”</p>
<p>Linfield FC’s chairman, Roy McGivern, commented on the decision, praising the long sponsorship agreement with Bet McLean while expressing excitement about the opportunity to keep harnessing their partnership next to Paul McLean and his team for the remainder of the 2023/24 season.</p>
<p>McGivern also spoke about the clear passion proven by the sportsbook for “promoting and growing local sport,” further expressing their delight for the deal expansion from the position of Northern Ireland’s greatest football club.</p>
<p>On a similar note, Linfield’s general manager, David Graham, spoke well of his collaboration with Paul Mclean, explaining that “it has been a pleasure” to work next to him since he joined Linfield earlier in the year. Graham also mentioned the discussions they had revolving around the way they could maximize their partnership to the fullest for both parties.</p>
<p>Graham also took the opportunity to express their satisfaction for having secured the four trackside signs along with the first team sponsorship from “a local company with such a strong reputation.” The GM explained that sponsorships represent the primary facet they can use to secure and grow the club’s commercial revenue.</p>
<p>Finally, while mentioning their desire to boost match attendance and improve the overall matchday experience for its supporters, Graham expressed hope to be able to keep proving that Linfield represents “fertile ground” where businesses can grow via strong partnerships and where they can promote their brands.</p>
<p>Bet McLean has also inked a similar deal with the Northern Ireland Football League Cup, sponsoring it from the 2017–18 season onward.</p>
<p>In August, a new Caytoo study revealed that gambling companies continue to be in the lead when it comes to soccer sponsorships. The results came in spite of an anticipated ban on front-of-shirt gambling sponsorships.</p>
