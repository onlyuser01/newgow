<p>AAA annually reviews more than 32K hotels and restaurants, with just 7% receiving a Four Diamond or higher rating. For hotels, 1,752 properties earned the AAA Four Diamond distinction for 2022.</p>
<p>A Four Diamond hotel must offer upscale amenities and distinctive fine dining. AAA inspectors also require a commitment to quality and consistent service to receive esteemed recognition.</p>
<p>Our luxurious accommodations and premier guest services are a defining feature of our property,” said Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Maryland General Manager Ryan Eller. “The AAA Four Diamond rating recognizes our commitment to providing a best-in-class experience from the moment a guest enters the casino to the moment they check out of the hotel.”</p>
<p>Unannounced Inspections</p>
<p>For more than 80 years, AAA’s professional inspectors have been making unannounced visits to hotels for in-person evaluations. The reviews are tailored toward evaluating properties based on AAA member priorities such as cleanliness, property condition, service, and overall experience.</p>
<p>“AAA-inspected and approved hotels reflect a commitment to quality and consistency in the hospitality industry. Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Maryland remains part of a prestigious group of luxury hotels to hold this rating that considers cleanliness, comfort, cuisine, and consistency,” read a release from The Cordish Companies, which operates the casino resort.</p>
<p>AAA Diamonds are earned through unscheduled hotel inspections. Live! had no knowledge of when the AAA inspectors would visit the resort to review its accommodations and associated amenities and services.</p>
<p>Along with being the only AAA Four Diamond casino in Maryland, Live! Casino &amp; Hotel is additionally the only AAA Four Diamond hotel in the BWI Airport District and in Anne Arundel County. The international airport is in the heart of the Baltimore/Washington corridor, just off the Baltimore-Washington 295 Parkway at the Arundel Mills exit.</p>
<p>In February, Cordish Companies Chairman and CEO David Cordish hinted to the Baltimore Business Journal that a considerable expansion of the company’s Hanover resort will likely come in the near future.</p>
<p>Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Maryland is one of numerous Four Diamond AAA casinos in the US, with most being located in Las Vegas. In Southern Nevada, Four Diamond AAA casino resorts include Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, The Mirage, Cosmopolitan, Resorts World, and Circa. Five Diamond casinos in Sin City include the Bellagio and Aria.</p>
<p>Resort Details</p>
<p>Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Maryland features 310 guest rooms, including 52 suites.</p>
<p>As for the casino, Live! is equipped with 4,000 slot machines, 200 live dealer table games, and a FanDuel Sportsbook. The resort additionally offers a 75,000-square-foot concert and events space called The Hall.</p>
<p>Last year, Live! Casino was the second-richest casino in Maryland after MGM National Harbor in Oxon Hill, just outside the nation’s capital. In 2022, Live! generated more than $705.3 million gross gaming revenue from retail slots and table games. Only MGM’s Maryland casino won more money at $884.5 million.</p>
