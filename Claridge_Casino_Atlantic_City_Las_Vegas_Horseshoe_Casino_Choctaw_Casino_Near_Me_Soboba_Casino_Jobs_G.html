<p>The Baltimore Ravens vs. San Francisco 49ers is one of the three Christmas Day games of Week 16 but is the most interesting one. The two in-form teams are meeting on Monday evening, with a live broadcast on ABC</p>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers are 11-3 in the 2023 NFL season and are sitting at the top of the National Football Conference (NFC). The Baltimore Ravens are 11-3 and are sitting at the top of the American Football Conference (AFC).</p>
<p>The Niners are brilliant at home with a 6-1 record in 2023. The Ravens are fantastic on the road, with six wins in away games this season and just one loss.</p>
<p>All of this tells us that NFL fans are in for a real treat on Christmas, although the Ravens vs. 49ers odds suggest the home team will have a relatively easy job. Bookies see San Francisco as a one-touchdown favorite right now, are they right to think so?</p>

<p>Baltimore Ravens Believing in Christmas Miracles</p>
<p>The Ravens are 11-3 in the 2023 season with the best defense in the league, conceding just 16.1 points per game. This explains why John Harbaugh’s men have been able to defeat some of the league’s most productive offenses – Detroit Lions, Indianapolis Colts, etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to their losses, two of those happened against teams that are famously very good when it comes to defending – Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns.</p>
<p>Their third loss was in their first game against the Colts, but you can think of it as a glitch. Not only did it happen early in the season, but the Colts beat them by a field goal after overtime.</p>
<p>Further, back then, Baltimore’s quarterback Lamar Jackson wasn’t playing as well as he’s been playing over the last couple of weeks. Although he did get an interception in each of his last two games, the 27-year-old quarterback recorded a total of four TD passes in those games.</p>
<p>Reasons Why NFL Odds are Favoring San Francisco 49ers</p>
<p>The Baltimore at San Francisco odds suggest the home team will have a relatively easy job on Christmas. That’s no surprise given that these guys have been fantastic throughout the 2023 season, winning 11 games already and losing just three.</p>
<p>All of their losses happened in October, and they’re undefeated since, with six wins in a row. Most of those were against teams with a record of under .500, but we did see them demolish the reigning NFC champions the Philadelphia Eagles 42-19 on the road.</p>
<p>The Niners are superb in all aspects of the game, with their defensive team being the one with the lowest average of conceded goals (16.1 PPG). Their offense is third in the league with 30.4 PPG, but their average in their last three games is much better than that – 38.3 PPG.</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens vs. San Francisco 49ers Prediction</p>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers are simply better than the Baltimore Ravens, which is why they’d be favorites even if the game was played in Maryland. However, the 2023 Christmas game is played at Levi’s Stadium, where the Niners are 5-1. That’s why we expect them not only to win but to cover the 5.5-point spread with no major issues.</p>
<p>Pick: San Francisco 49ers -5.5 (-110)</p>
