<p>Better Collective, a global sports betting media platform, has announced that it hired Britt Boeskov as its new senior vice president of strategy. Before joining Better Collective, Boeskov worked at Kindred Group, the leading employer in Sweden.</p>
<p>Boeskov’s Appointment Will Be Effective on March 1</p>
<p>Boeskov’s appointment at Better Collective will be effective on March 1, and in her new role, she’ll support the company’s sports betting media market growth. She brings a lot of C-level experience from Kindred Group, and her expertise in the intersection between customers, products, and technology is likely to be vital for Better Collective.</p>
<p>The CEO and co-founder of Better Collective, Jesper Søgaard, stated that the company is thrilled to have Boeskov on the team and looks forward to welcoming her. He added that she has a lot of experience and knowledge in the industry, especially in “digital projects towards end-users.”</p>
<p>Søgaard concluded that Better Collective is a fast-growing company with great ambitions and revolutionary ideas, and Boeskov is seen as a vital part of its growth.</p>
<p>Kindred Has Been Boeskov’s Home Since 2005</p>
<p>Boeskov joined Kindred in 2005 and gained a leadership executive role in 2019. She announced her resignation from the company on LinkedIn. Before becoming the chief experience officer at Kindred, she served two years as a chief program officer and another seven as chief operating officer. Her Kindred working experience also spans business development manager, head of marketing communication services, and head of acquisition services.</p>
<p>At the moment, Boeskov also serves as Racecourse Media Group’s non-executive director. While speaking about the new appointment, she stated that she’s excited to join Better Collective when it seems to be crucial for its growth. She added that she’s followed Better Collective in the past couple of years and is impressed with what the organization offers.</p>
<p>Better Collective recently gained massive exposure in the US thanks to the newly-formed partnership with The New York Post. The agreement will allow both sides to expand their reach and gain a more comprehensive sport betting audience.</p>
<p>Marc Pedersen, the CEO of Better Collective US, stated that the company believes in educating bettors by providing relevant data and statistics to improve their overall betting experience.</p>
<p>Because The New York Post has over 11 million readers, Pedersen is convinced that Better Collective will be able to reach a wider audience and thus, capitalize on its growth plans.</p>
<p>Media outlets are now no longer strangers to sports betting partnerships. Recently, the NY Times purchased The Athletic as a way to boost its sports coverage and expand it into sports betting.</p>
