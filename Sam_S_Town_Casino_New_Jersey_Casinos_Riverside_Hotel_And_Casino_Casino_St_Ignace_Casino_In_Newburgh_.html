    <h1>Sam S Town Casino New Jersey Casinos Riverside Hotel And Casino Casino St Ignace Casino In Newburgh</h1>

<p>I just don’t agree with the fact that I found Bitstarz on a site that said they accept US players. With the ease of signing up, that doesn’t usually happen with sites that have USA blacklisted, I believed this was a site that was legal for the US to gamble on. I am used to the casino taking responsibility and respecting the blacklisting or illegal aspects of their own business and making it so that they comply, and assist in respecting foreign laws and policies. I feel like this is crucial so that we can have an extra helping hand, ensuring we don’t accidently break our own laws, (we can get into trouble over these things otherwise they would be legal and not blacklisted.) These casinos make millions of dollars and it is the responsible thing to do to utilize some of that currency that they are blessed to have and protect our well being by blocking ip addresses. They have plenty of legal gamblers who give them money in exchange for their services. They wouldn’t be who they are or have any success without their customers. I personally would have appreciated their help identifying my ip as a United States location. If they were concerned with their customers protection and not the money they could capitalize on, they would assist in obeying the laws and regulations set forth for important reasons. This would allow us to gain trust so that we can earn more slack and work towards a mutually beneficial goal where the laws and regulations can be more relaxed. This could open the doors for more countries to feel safer to allow us to gamble anywhere in the world. Also it would have prevented me from finding and experiencing the horrible setups like Bitstarz has with their software. I wouldn’t have had to experience such disgustingly greedy slots that are constantly putting out way below the expected RTP on almost every single one of my estimated 15 deposits. All at different dates, different times, and various slots. My return was always so far below the advertised return that it was as low as 10 percent, and stayed more at that range then the advertised for the majority of all my deposits. I think I had one that may have been around 85 percent but that was it. Now I know rtp is judged by a lot more play than I had done, but out of the thousands of spins I had with them, I would have expected to have not just hit rock bottom numbers. There should have been least one deposit that was above at least. Some kind of proof that this wasn’t all these slots were capable of. This was disgusting to have to go through, but acceptable if I had not found out that I was from a blacklisted country! From what I understand this is against the law to even be playing at Bitstarz to begin with. If they were a little more respectable of that written statement that is posted on their site and valued their customers legality, this could have been avoided totally. I also had mentioned to them numerous times early on that I was from the United States. I had duplicate accounts on accident and they identified me as a United States IP address in order to connect the 2 accounts. I had also mentioned to them in my complaints where I was from on a few occasions as well. They continued to let me deposit anyways to their very controlled and fixed software. It would let me get a small win and a guaranteed reclaim that always followed it. This was a ridiculous pattern that made me feel like Groundhog Day. Predictable and as expected as the sun rising and setting. I wish I would have never played at their casino because it was the top worst odds I had ever experienced at any one of the hundred or so casinos I have played at. Thousands of spins and no random aspect was noticeable to me and I have been online gambling since 2004. I know and credit it when I see it. This to me is not gambling because every win was obviously just an excuse to take that and more immmedialty after. I refuse to accept their word that these are fair when I had to sit through nothing but proof it was otherwise, 95 percent of my gameplay… In the end the results of the games speak louder than the false advertising. My losing streak of deposits stretched much longer than about 9 out of 10 casinos I had been to. It was making it obvious that there was no chance. If you saw how many of their customers don’t win, you would be shocked. This was very obvious that my deposits were not going to have any return, but I kept depositing for one reason…They dangled that beautiful Tesla in front of my face with that little icon on the bottom left of the screen showing is how many entries I had. Thats why I had continued to throw money away at Bitstarz. I never had a chance to win it due to the fact that I am from a blacklisted country… This is where I have to draw the line. It is NOT acceptable that we are denied all the perks and bonuses that allowed players are entitled to. I could have spent that money elsewhere. This is why I want you to arbitrate this. It is an acceptable reason.</p>
