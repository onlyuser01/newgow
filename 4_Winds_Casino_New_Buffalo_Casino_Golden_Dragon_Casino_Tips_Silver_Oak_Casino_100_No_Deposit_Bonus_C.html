<p>Greentube Debuts in the US via GNOG Partnership in New Jersey</p>
<p>Greentube, the interactive division of producer and operator of gaming technologies Novomatic, has announced that it signed a partnership deal with Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) to go live with its content in New Jersey and make its long-awaited debut in the US.</p>
<p>The strategic partnership deal between Greentube and GNOG will ensure the interactive division of the Austrian-headquartered manufacturer of gaming technologies sets foot in the US and begins its journey across US markets as more and more states legalize online casino games.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, some of the most popular titles of Greentube’s portfolio of online casino games, like Diamond Cash: Mighty Elephant, Diamond Cash: Mighty Sevens and Diamond Cash: Oasis Riches, will be made available to players at GoldenNuggetCasino.com in the Garden State, as Greentube is looking to leverage its significant experience gained from European gaming jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Speaking about the arrangement, GNOG vice president Warren Steven pointed to the impeccable track record Greentube boasts in Europe, “having developed blue-chip titles, as well as innovative new games that have proven longevity in numerous markets.”</p>
<p>This partnership will significantly enhance our existing offering with premium content, and we are excited to be the first operator in the US to give our customers access to the Greentube portfolio.” Warren Steven, VP, GNOG</p>
<p>Looking at US markets as opportunities for “unparalleled potential” and “key territory” for the company going forward, Greentube is finally ready to make its debut, said Greentube CFO/CGO Michael Bauer, outlining the excitement from the opportunity to introduce the company’s content via a partnership with a prominent brand like GNOG.</p>
<p>We see this market entry as a first and very important step into the US market and are preparing ourselves for future launches in Michigan and Pennsylvania as well.” Michael Bauer, CFO/CGO, Greentube</p>
<p>Expansion Begins</p>
<p>The strategic partnership with GNOG serves not only as a launching pad for Novomatic’s interactive division, but also positions the firm to take advantage of other business opportunities in the future, while Greentube adds the final touches of additional deals across numerous gaming jurisdictions in pursuit of its North American expansion strategy.</p>
<p>In July, Greentube enhanced its presence in Canada after a deal with Loto-Quebec ensured the company’s gaming content is live in a second Canadian province, following its debut via the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) in British Columbia two months earlier.</p>
<p>Outside of the region, Greentube made its debut in Ukraine last month. That came after an agreement with First Casino, an early entrant into the country’s newly-regulated iGaming market, made it possible for the company’s portfolio of online casino games to reach local players.</p>
