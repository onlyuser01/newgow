    <h1>Good Casinos In California Victory Casino Cruises Reviews Eagle Mountain Casino Photos Aliante Casin</h1>

<p>The prominent supplier of casino games has obtained a new certification that will further enhance its ability to deploy products and obtain licensure in individual European markets</p>
<p>Habanero is a company known for a string of successful games, with the company developing more than 140 slot games, as well as the supporting infrastructure. This accreditation will allow the company to pursue new market opportunities and meet regulatory standards in tightly-regulated markets.</p>
<p>Habanero Set for Further Growth in Europe Thanks to License</p>
<p>Habanero also develops original marketing tools that aid partner operators to elicit a strong response from the supplier’s original games, and the company also develops a trademarked jackpot system. Company head of business development Arcangelo Lonoce was similarly excited about the opportunity:</p>
<p>Adding a further layer of protection to our products, the ISO-27001 certificate marks an important milestone for all leading providers in terms of IT governance, security protection and brand reputation. Habanero Arcangelo Lonoce</p>
<p>Habanero will benefit from the licensure as it will allow it to pursue entry into specific markets that have higher technical regulatory standards. Greece and Switzerland are two places where ISO-27001 is mandatory before a supplier may join in, but Habanero will certainly be leveraging its new accreditation beyond those individual jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p>Lonoce added that the company is always striving to provide an experience that aligns with regulatory prerequisites and expectations. Presently, Habanero has been on a tear, having secured partnerships with leading European operators, including Snaitech, Betway and Betsson.</p>
<p>The company also obtained another important license – from the Malta Gaming Authority and it is committed to continuing to expand and grow its footprint. In the meantime, Habanero has released a number of outstanding games, including Naughty Wukong, Rainbow Mania, and Taiko Beats.</p>
