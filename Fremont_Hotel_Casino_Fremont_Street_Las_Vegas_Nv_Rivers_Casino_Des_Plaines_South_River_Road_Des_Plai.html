    <h1>Fremont Hotel Casino Fremont Street Las Vegas Nv Rivers Casino Des Plaines South River Road Des Plai</h1>

<p>Dear Nick,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply although I'm slightly perplexed as to why you are ignoring the main point of my complaint which is a clear breach of Chipstars own Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Their T&amp;C's state the following when my account was operational</p>
<ol>
<li>What will happen to my account if it isn't verified?</li>
</ol>
<p>Until you get verified you can use play money to check out the platform and gameplay. After you get registered you can make a deposit and receive deposit bonus and get included in the VIP program.</p>
<p>As previously stated my account was NEVER verified but I was able to deposit over EUR27,000 in less than a month. I can assure it definitely wasn't fictitious play money I was using on an unverified account. I did however get included into their VIP program very quickly.</p>
<p>As I have also already informed you the exact balance on my account was zero when my account got blocked and the casino sent me back EUR8,000 out of my net deposits of EUR26,300. This means that they are still withholding EUR18,300 of my deposits that they accepted on an unverified account and an account from the UK that they also say they couldn't/didn't accept.</p>
<p>Obviously had I won they would have rightly voided ALL transactions and returned ALL my deposits, which is something they did on a previous complaint from forum member kod1 but only because he won!!. However as I lost they decided to keep all bar EUR8.000 of the EUR26,300 deposits . A win/win situation for them and nothing but breach of T&amp;C's and fraud.</p>
<p>It would appear that as part of the complaints process you have not even contacted Chipstars to ask them why they have breached their own T&amp;C's. You have also not asked them why they knowingly opened an account from a restricted territory (the UK). They themselves say they don't allow accounts from the UK to be opened so how did it happen? As I will continue to state had I won they would NOT have paid out winnings and their actions on kod1 accounts prove this point.</p>
<p>Casino Guru has said they stick to the Fair Gambling Codex.</p>
<p>I have read through it and it clearly states the following</p>
<p>Definition of fair casinos</p>
<p>A 'fair casino' is an online casino that:</p>
<p>Pays out all legitimate winnings</p>
<p>Doesn't have any unfair clauses in their Terms and Conditions (T&amp;Cs) (more on this later in the article)</p>
<p>Doesn't use any deceitful practices to trick players</p>
<p>Enforces restricted countries (doesnâ€™t allow players from them to create an account or play from a restricted country) and restricted bonuses (only gives bonuses to eligible players)</p>
<ol>
<li>Restricted countries</li>
</ol>
<p>The casino's point of view</p>
<p>Whenever someone from a restricted country registers, these casinos allow them to create an account, but only let them know about the restriction when they want to make a withdrawal. As long as a player is losing, the casino is OK with it, but as soon as the player wins and wants to withdraw money, they use the 'restricted countries' rule to decline the withdrawal and block the player's account.</p>
<p>This is, of course, extremely unfair, as players might register without knowing about the restrictions, and casinos are taking advantage of their mistake, often knowingly and intentionally.</p>
<p>If a player is able to access the casino's website, open the registration form, create an account, deposit and play, it's understandable that they assume that they are allowed to play at this casino.</p>
<p>Our position</p>
<p>It is not acceptable to let players gamble if a casino knows that they are from a restricted country</p>
<p>So if Casino Guru point of view is that it is not acceptable I am shocked that you still haven't asked Chipstars as to how the account form the UK was able to be opened. As I have stated previously I did NOT use a VPN and my IP address will have been from the UK, as were all of my registration details. The fact that they had the UK available on their drop down box of countries at registration would show that they were actively seeking UK customers.</p>
<p>Finally this is not a license dispute and I'm sure you are more than aware of that. Furthermore even if it was then the Curacao regulators as about as useful as a chocolate teapot. A Curacao license means no regulation at all.</p>
<p>I trust that you will now finally get in contact with chipstars as a complaints process has to involve all parties in the discussion. Up until now it would appear that despite overwhelming evidence I have provided you showing clear breaches of chipstars T&amp;Cs, manipulated to their advantage you don't seem to want to find out why they have done this.</p>
<p>in answer to the question "why did you even register there if you did see that they do not have a UKG license?"</p>
<p>I am a severe disordered gambler and am signed up to gamstop which preevnts me from opened accoutns at any genuine UK accepting bookmakers. Chipstars were/are actively marketing for UK gambling addicts. just google chipstars and non gamstop to see this!!</p>
<p>I look forward to yours and chipstars replies</p>
