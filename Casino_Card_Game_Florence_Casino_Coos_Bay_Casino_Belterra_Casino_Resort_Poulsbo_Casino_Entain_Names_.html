    <h1>Casino Card Game Florence Casino Coos Bay Casino Belterra Casino Resort Poulsbo Casino Entain Names</h1>

<p>Chair Gibson applauded Sandler’s profound knowledge of Entain’s business and praised the new appointee’s trust in the quality of Entain’s operations and growth opportunities</p>
<p>Global sports betting and gaming giant Entain has unveiled a major new appointment to its team. As announced by the company, the experienced Ricky Sandler will join its team as a non-executive director.</p>
<p>The appointment is with immediate effect, Entain added. It also explained that under the UK Corporate Governance Code, Sandler will not be considered an independent NED.</p>
<p>In addition to joining Entain as a NED, Sandler will also become a member of the gambling group’s People &amp; Governance and Capital Allocation committees. He will also work with the company to identify an additional non-executive director who is “mutually agreeable” to both Eminence and Entain.</p>
<p>For reference, Sandler is the founder, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Eminence Capital, a global investment management firm. Eminence Capital was founded in 1999 and now stands as a $6.5 billion global investment management organization.</p>
<p>As CEO and CIO, Sandler is experienced in managing an elite team of investors. His responsibilities have seen him steer Eminence’s strategic direction, turning it into the company it is today.</p>
<p>Prior to founding Eminence, Sandler served as co-founder and co-general partner of Fusion Capital Management. His earlier experience includes a tenure at Mark Asset Management where he began his investment career.</p>
<p>Entain added that Sandler served as a NED at Ashland from January 2020 to January 2023. He also serves as an advisor on the Investment Committee for the University of Wisconsin Foundation and is a Chartered Financial Analyst.</p>
<p>Sandler Is Looking Forward to Working with Entain</p>
<p>Sandler was welcomed on board by Entain’s chairman, Barry Gibson. Gibson applauded Sandler’s profound knowledge of Entain’s business and praised the new appointee’s trust in the quality of Entain’s operations and growth opportunities. The chair concluded that the company is poised to benefit from the new NED’s experience.</p>
<p>We look forward to benefiting from his perspectives and expertise as we work to drive value for all Entain shareholders. Barry Gibson, chair, Entain</p>
<p>Sandler also commented on his new appointment, praising Entain’s robust business, market-leading tools and unique tech platforms. According to him, the company has multiple “enviable positions” in key markets across the world.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with my fellow directors to help Entain achieve long-term success and create lasting value for its shareholders. Ricky Sandler, NED, Entain</p>
<p>The announcement of Sandler’s appointment led to a slight increase in Entain’s stock price.</p>
