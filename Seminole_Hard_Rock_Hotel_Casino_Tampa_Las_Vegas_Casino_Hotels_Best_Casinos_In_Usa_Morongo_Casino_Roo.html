The two-year agreement will fuel all WBSC worldwide tournaments with Sportradar’s fraud detection technology.</p>

<p>Universal Fraud Detection System (UFDS) is the name of Sportradar’s state-of-the-art technology designed to closely monitor bets and assess unusual betting patterns in search of suspicious behaviors.

Last November, Sportradar signed similar deals with the Slovak Basketball Association and the easyCredit Basketball Bundesliga. In December, Sportradar expanded its long partnership with Bundesliga International according to a new five-year contract.</p>
<p>UFDS has been thoroughly evaluated by independent bodies and experts part of the sports betting and sports integrity fields. Over the past 17 years, Sportradar has managed to successfully identify over 6,900 cases of suspicious games across a variety of sports worldwide, and 900 of them were reported in 2021.</p>
<p>WBSC’s President Riccardo Fraccari has expressed the confederation’s eagerness to start employing Sportradar’s bet monitoring and state-of-the-art intelligence solutions to detect and assess potential sports integrity threats. Sportradar also uses different solutions that allow it to promote and keep the unpredictability of sports like softball and baseball while protecting the overall global sports scene from all forms of manipulation. WBSC is planning on improving the practices that promote clean baseball and softball athletes, and the new Sportradar partnership will fit its plans like a glove.</p>
<p>WBSC’s Integrity Unit Has Organized Informative Webinars</p>
<p>Last November, WBSC has worked together with the International Olympic Committee’s Olympic Movement Unit on the Prevention of the Manipulation of Competition to organize a number of webinars focusing on the topic of manipulation in sports competitions. The webinars were spread in two series, on November 25 for officials and staff members of sports teams and November 30 for athletes. Both sessions introduced the concept of match-fixing and competition manipulation while also discussing the risks and sanctions tied to manipulation attempts.</p>
