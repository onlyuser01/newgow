    <h1>Remington Park Casino Oklahoma Gila River Resort And Casino Black Hawk Casinos Longhorn Hotel And Ca</h1>

<p>Esports-oriented betting operator Pinnacle has unveiled the third edition of its famous Pinnacle Cup Counter-Strike: Global Offensive series. The Pinnacle Cup III event is scheduled to begin on November 8-23 this year.</p>
<p>The Best Teams Will Play for the $80,000 Lion’s Share</p>
<p>The tournament will play out in pretty much the same fashion as its previous iterations. It will have a group stage, a Swiss stage, and playoffs. The best teams in the world will join the competition with several of them joining mid-event in the later stages. Teams SKADE, HAVU, Forze, CPH Flames, and Dignitas will join the other teams directly during the Swiss stage. Then, in the playoff stage, four more teams will join. The latter few are yet to be announced.</p>
<p>The third Pinnacle cup will offer the same prize pool as its predecessors. With a total of $100,000 in store, the event will likely adopt the usual for the series winner-takes-most approach with $80,000 reserved for the winning team and $20,000 for the second place. The prize goes beyond the monetary aspect as it will get the champion a ticket for the Pinnacle World Championship next year.</p>
<p>Pinnacle Remains Committed to Hosting Quality CS:GO Events</p>
<p>The organizer has set everything for an exciting fan experience. It has once again secured notable partners who will drive engagement further. GRID will be joining as an exclusive data partner, GosuGamers will help advertise the tournament as an official media partner and Relog Media will make a return and help with the overall production.</p>
<p>The chief marketing officer of Pinnacle, Ben Cove, spoke on the announcement. He explained that Pinnacle is happy that fans and players have enjoyed the organizer’s events this year. Cove explained that the Pinnacle team is excited to announce the new event and once again gather the best Counter-Strike teams in the world.</p>
<p>“CS:GO is a focus title for Pinnacle, and it’s proven to produce mass viewership across our key regions, so we are naturally excited to announce the third edition of our Pinnacle Cup CSGO series,” Cove said.</p>
<p>He teased that this is “just the start” and Pinnacle has a lot more in store. According to the CMO, the company is planning to run more LAN events starting in 2022. Other than that, the Pinnacle team is working hard to make the upcoming Pinnacle World Championship a truly unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>The Pinnacle Cup III will be broadcast on The Esports Bible’s official channels. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive fans and bettors should definitely lookout for this one.</p>
