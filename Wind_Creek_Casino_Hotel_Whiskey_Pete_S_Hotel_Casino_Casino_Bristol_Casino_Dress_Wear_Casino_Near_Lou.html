<p>Olivier Aubin-Mercier Wants to Stay Undefeated in the PFL</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Quebec Kid is 17-5 in his professional MMA career with all five of his losses happening in events organized by the UFC. It was 2021 when he gave up on his UFC dream and signed for the PFL. Since then, he’s 6-0 with five wins by decision and one by knockout.</p>
<p>The KO win happened in the season finale last November when we saw the Canadian put Stevie Ray to the ground with a powerful punch in the dying moments of the second round.</p>
<p>Beating Ray meant becoming the PFL champ and getting the $1 million prize. He would love to do the same again, but in 2023, competition is much fiercer in the PFL Lightweight Division. It’s mainly because Shane Burgos is competing there this year.</p>
<p>Shane Burgos Has the Eyes on the $1 Million Prize</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Aubin-Mercier commented on Shane Burgos’ chance of winning the 2023 PFL Lightweight Tournament, saying that he can’t see that happening as the American is taking too many risks in his fights. But risky fighting style is what made Burgos a household name in the MMA universe.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Bronx native is 15-3 overall with an 8-3 record in the UFC, the promotion in which he fought from 2016 until last summer. Two of his losses happened by KO/TKO, which is probably what Aubin-Mercier was alluding to.</p>
<p>He also probably alluded to the fact that his next opponent is famous for landing a lot of strikes, while also getting punched a lot. Burgos lands 7.40 significant strikes per minute on average while absorbing 6.78.</p>
<p>Olivier Aubin-Mercier vs. Shane Burgos Prediction</p>
<p>Shane Burgos is probably the one who will dictate this fight. His rival would love to take him to the ground, but Burgos is great at takedown defense. That said, we’ll probably witness a boxing match on Saturday.</p>
<p>And it’s going to be a fun one. Both fighters are bound to throw a lot of strikes throughout the fight, but it’s Burgos who’s likely to be the one to land more. That said, our prediction for the PFL 3 headliner is Burgos by decision.</p>
<p>Pick: Shane Burgos to win by decision</p>
