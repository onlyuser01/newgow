    <h1>Black Lotus Casino Bonus Codes Treasure Bay Casino Graton Casino Hotel Casino Rhode Island Casino In</h1>

<p>Last weekend, the Green Bay Packers lost their fourth straight game in the NFL. Losing four games in a row in one season is something that hadn’t happened to them since 2016. Does this mean Aaron Rodgers &amp; Co. are in trouble? Not necessarily, especially not if they manage to end their losing streak on Sunday.</p>

<p>Green Bay Packers Have 17% Chance to Make the Playoffs</p>
<p>Since Aaron Rodgers became the Green Bay Packers starting quarterback in 2008, this team has missed the playoffs only on three occasions. Unfortunately for their fans, they could miss it this year as well. The thing is that after going 3-5 in the first eight weeks of the 2022 NFL season, Green Bay’s chance of qualifying for the postseason is just 17%.</p>
<p>It’s not only because they haven’t been playing good football; it’s also because their divisional rivals (particularly, the Minnesota Vikings) have been pretty decent in 2022.</p>
<p>The good news, however, is that there’s still time for Aaron Rodgers and his teammates to get to a playoff spot. For that to happen, however, they need to up their game ASAP. Green Bay’s offense just has to do better as with 18.1 PPG, they’re sixth from behind in the league.</p>
<p>Their defense, on the other hand, has been decent, but we’ll see how they do on Sunday against the revamped offense of the Detroit Lions.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions Offense is Back on Track</p>
<p>The Lions offense scored 27 points against the Miami Dolphins in the previous round, which is a great improvement in comparison to their previous two games, in which they scored just 6 points combined.</p>
<p>Quarterback Jared Goff did a fine job in that game, throwing 27/37 for 321 yards and one touchdown with no interceptions. Still, the hero of the day was Detroit’s running back Jamaal Williams who made 10 carries for 53 yards and two touchdowns against Miami.</p>
<p>Detroit’s defense, however, was abysmal, which is what cost this team the win – they ended up conceding 31 points that night.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers vs Detroit Lions Week 9 Prediction</p>
<p>Green Bay’s Achilles’ heel this season has been the offense. Aaron Rodgers has been playing okay, but he just doesn’t have good enough receivers to aim at. The good news is that even mediocre receivers should be enough to outplay Detroit’s horrendous defense. As a result, we could see the Packers scoring more than 30 points for the first time in 2022.</p>
<p>Picks: Green Bay Packers to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
