<p>Gernot Blümel, finance minister of Austria commented on the subject by congratulating the Finance Police for their success. He outlined that as a result of the preventive actions by the Finance Police, the outstanding illegal gambling activity is not active across the country but rather it is rather concentrated in certain urban areas. Blümel further added that the fight against illegal gambling in the country will continue. The finance minister stressed that the illegal gambling market must be met with strength in order to decrease the number of people which are negatively affected.</p>
