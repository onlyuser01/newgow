<p>Puerto Rican Casinos’ Roulette Machines Alleged Rigger on the Run</p>

<p>Authorities in Puerto Rico have finally presented charges against a man they identified last December as a casino thief. Edmanuel Victoria was rigging electronic roulette machines across the island, and the authorities’ delay in delivering their case likely stems from their belief that Victoria wasn’t acting alone.</p>

<p>Media outlet El Globo reported that the Puerto Rico Department of Justice filed charges this Wednesday against Victoria, accusing him of manipulating an electronic roulette wheel at the Tropical Casino in Bayamón. He allegedly stole more than $43K by tricking the machine to repeatedly give him free credit.</p>
<p>However, the case may be much bigger. Victoria, a Florida resident and native Cuban, also faces charges for a similar incident at the Marriott Hotel in Condado, Puerto, Rico. He could be working for a large criminal syndicate. In order to prosecute him, though, the authorities first have to find him.</p>
<p>Spinning Their Wheels</p>
<p>Prosecutors stated that Victoria visited the casino on two different dates in December of last year to execute his fraudulent scheme, obtaining illegal unlimited bets and collecting his illicit winnings. He now faces two counts of fraud and two counts of aggravated illegal appropriation in violation of the Puerto Rican Penal Code for his actions.</p>
<p>The investigation originated from the Property and Fraud Division of the San Juan Criminal Investigation Corps. Subsequently, it was sent to the Department of Justice once investigators realized that the case may be larger than they thought.</p>
<p>As a result, a court judge determined cause for arrest and imposed a bail of $400K on Victoria. He also faces charges in the District of San Juan for the other scheme, through which he illegally collected more than $19,100. The San Juan Court of First Instance confirmed the charges and issued an arrest warrant after he missed a preliminary hearing on April 12.</p>
<p>Depending on how the authorities want to proceed, Victoria is looking at spending a lot of time in prison. The charges in Bayamón and Condado are each good for a sentence of between three and eight years.</p>
<p>On the Run</p>
<p>What will have to be decided is if Victoria deserves consecutive or concurrent sentences. It’s a moot point for now, though, since Victoria is on the run. Investigators in the Bayamón case were able to identify him through casino surveillance footage. But he fled before they could move in to arrest him.</p>
