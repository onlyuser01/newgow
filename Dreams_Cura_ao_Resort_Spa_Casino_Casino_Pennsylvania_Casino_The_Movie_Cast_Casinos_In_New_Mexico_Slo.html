    <h1>Dreams Cura ao Resort Spa Casino Casino Pennsylvania Casino The Movie Cast Casinos In New Mexico Slo</h1>

<p>Supplier of online casino game content Pragmatic Play announced today its reach in the Latin American region has expanded with the launch of its award-winning bingo product in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Strengthening Existing Partnership</p>
<p>The launch of Pragmatic Play bingo happened as part of an expanded partnership deal with Facilitobet that made the operator the first online gaming brand in Venezuela to offer Pragmatic Play’s bingo product.</p>
<p>“We are excited to already start building upon our initial partnership with renowned operator, Facilitobet. They are incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about offering their customers the widest array of titles, and through our now expanded partnership we are helping them to deliver this.” Victor Arias, Vice President, Operations, Latin America, Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>The new agreement ensured Facilitobet’s product offering would further entice online casino players with a portfolio of bingo games provided by Pragmatic Play, including some of its most popular titles Sweet Bonanza Bingo, Bingo Blast, and The Jackpot Room.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is also providing Facilitobet with its suite of slot titles, Live Casino games, and Virtual Sports verticals under a previously agreed partnership with the Venezuelan brand earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Positive Customer Response</p>
<p>Henry Sánchez, Director at FacilitoBet, outlined the “positive response” the brand gained from its customers in relation to its partnership with Pragmatic Play, as well as the popularity of bingo in Venezuela, where it is a game with a “long tradition.”</p>
<p>“FacilitoBet is proud to be the first to offer the Pragmatic Play bingo range in the country. This helps us to expand our range of entertainment for the enjoyment of all our users. We are excited about the launch of this new product.” Henry Sánchez, Director, FacilitoBet</p>
<p>The expanded agreement with Facilitobet in Venezuela will further strengthen Pragmatic Play’s position on Latin American markets, where the supplier has already established its presence across a number of markets, including Brazil via business partnerships with local operators Estrelabet and MarjoSports and Paraguay, where Pragmatic Play teamed with Tower Star.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Pragmatic Play agreed to a partnership with the provider of online casino games platform One Bit Tech to deploy its portfolio of slot games and Live Casino with partners of One Bit Tech in the region.</p>
