    <h1>El Cortez Casino Mayag ez Resort Casino Are Casinos Rigged Casinos In Cleveland Ohio Casino In St Lo</h1>

<p>The company has negotiated a new partnership that will now allow it to bring market-leading content from six tracks in the country to global audiences</p>
<p>This will put Sports Information Services in a position to significantly strengthen its already impressive portfolio of racing content and deliver it to international partners. There will be 1,435 races more now available to partner operators who want to have more events covered.</p>
<p>The partnership will cover races from Merano, Pisa, Roma, Varese, Treviso and Agnano racetracks and continue to grow SIS’ position as a leading provider of content for the racing industry.</p>
<p>This is possible through direct collaboration with Media System Technologies, a betting and broadcast provider based in Italy. SIS is able to bring the most consolidated selection of racing content globally and the company is deemed one of the best 24/7 live betting service partners when it comes to horse racing content.</p>
<p>New Opportunities for Italian Horse Racing Globally</p>
<p>The company provides more than 68,000 live racing events every year through its 24/7 Live Betting Channels, and this comes in the form of an end-to-end solution that features on-screen graphics, betting triggers, live-streamed pictures, and more. SIS head of international horse racing Conall McSorley welcomed the opportunity and said:</p>
<p>The addition of high-class Italian content further emphasizes our focus to bring operators and their customers the widest range of betting opportunities from around the world 24/7, 365 days a year. SIS head of international horse racing Conall McSorley</p>
<p>Italy is an important upward trajectory, McSorley explained and expressed confidence that operators and bettors will respond to these new experiences positively. MST head of operation &amp; business development Michele Rosi was similarly pleased with the partnership and hailed SIS as a renowned partner known for its racing content and solutions.</p>
<p>“This deal will be integral in achieving our goal of promoting Italian Flat horse racing content worldwide and providing customers with attractive betting opportunities,” Rosi summed up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile IRw, a consortium of tracks in Italy which are covered under the partnership, also joined the conversation and said that it welcomed the opportunity to collaborate with both MST and SIS in popularizing racing content from Italy and bring it to global audiences.</p>
