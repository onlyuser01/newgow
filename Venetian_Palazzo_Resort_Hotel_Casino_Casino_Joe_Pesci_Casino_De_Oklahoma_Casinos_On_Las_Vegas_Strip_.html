<p>Global sports technology company Sportradar announced today that its US betting subsidiary, Sportradar Solutions LLC, was granted gaming licenses in Maryland and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Securing New State Licenses</p>
<p>Sportradar’s betting subsidiary received a Sports Wagering Contractor License in Maryland and a temporary permit in Wisconsin, a Gaming-Related Contractor Certificate, to expand its operations in two jurisdictions that recently introduced legal wagering on sports.</p>
<p>“Sportradar is constantly looking for opportunities to expand offerings for its partners and customers and, from a betting standpoint that starts with securing state licenses in key states like Maryland and Wisconsin, which have multiple professional sports teams, as well as very passionate fanbases.” Arne Rees, CEO, Sportradar US</p>
<p>Legal sports betting in Maryland was launched earlier in the month following a significant delay due to the Sports Wagering Applicant Review Commission’s (SWARC) refusal to award sports betting licenses. The latest delay stirred controversy in the state and Gov. Larry Hogan publicly stated the commission was purposefully delaying the official launch and subduing to outside pressure.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, legal wagering on sport was launched on the last day of November when the Oneida Nation opened a sportsbook at its Oneida Casino in Green Bay. The launch of the tribal sportsbook was made possible after an agreement with International Game Technology (IGT) ensured sports betting operations would be powered by IGT’s PlaySport retail and mobile wagering platform.</p>
<p>“These licenses further Sportradar’s leadership position in the US and allow us to grow these new markets with our best-in-class data, products, and services, all backed by the highest levels of integrity.” Arne Rees, CEO, Sportradar US</p>
<p>With the addition of the licenses in Maryland and Wisconsin, Sportradar is now holding a total of 26 licenses across state and tribal levels in the US, including Connecticut where it was granted an Online Gaming Service Provider license last month, alongside a renewal of its Sports Wagering Supplier license in West Virginia.</p>
<p>In December alone, Sportradar teamed with Australian-based gaming operator PointsBet in a multi-year data supplier deal to become the operator’s US supplier of choice and announced a 5-year extension of its partnership with Kambi Group to continue to be the tech company’s exclusive supplier of NHL, NBA and MLB data.</p>
<p>On an international level, supplier of data and integrity services Sportradar enhanced its existing agreement with the Royal Netherlands Football Association (KNVB) to provide the national soccer governing body with integrity services, monitoring and safeguarding measures over men’s and women’s competitions in the country.</p>
<p>In November, the Swiss Handball Federation became the latest national sport governing body to team with Sportradar and benefit from its Universal Fraud Detection System’s monitoring and integrity protection capabilities.</p>
