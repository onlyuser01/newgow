<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have an account at mywin24.com. I have deposited 50 EU and my final balance was 131 EU. Then I had a email from casino</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"We are sorry to inform you that you have violated the terms of the bonus you claimed recently. The following violations have been found:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages and then final stages completed with cash bets when bonus funds have been released or forfeited and/or reaching a bonus feature, exiting the game to later go back and play the feature." And they took from my balance 81 EU.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I declare that I didn't use "bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages and then final stages completed with cash". Even more my bonuses where turned off and I didn't have a chance to play with bonus funds long ago. There where some games from those I played that had progress feature but this guys don't even tried to check if progress where made from real money or bonus fund. If they check they will see that progress was from real money. I claimed them to revise but they don't answer. Amount is not big, but I don't like such tipe of behaviour and I will achieve justice.</p>
