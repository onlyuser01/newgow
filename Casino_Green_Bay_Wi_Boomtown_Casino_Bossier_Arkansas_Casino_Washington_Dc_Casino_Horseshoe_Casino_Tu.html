    <h1>Casino Green Bay Wi Boomtown Casino Bossier Arkansas Casino Washington Dc Casino Horseshoe Casino Tu</h1>

<p>Dear Xotin36,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the general terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>„For those who want to set limits on their gambling, the Company offers a voluntary self-exclusion service, which allows a customer to close his account or restrict his gambling activities for one of the following periods: 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. The decision to close the account is made only after the user provides photos of documents confirming that he is the owner of the account.</p>
<p>The consideration period for a blocking request cannot exceed 14 days. If the customer fails to provide all the necessary documents within this timeframe, the self-exclusion procedure will be canceled.</p>
<p>Once his account has been self-excluded, it will be closed until the selected time period has elapsed. Once the self-exclusion period has ended, the user will be able to recommence his use of any Services. The user can request that the restrictions are removed from your account before the self-exclusion period has ended, however the final decision rests with the Company..</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>During the self-exclusion period you must not attempt to open a new Account and you must accept that the Company shall have no financial liability and shall not be held otherwise accountable if you continue gambling or using a new Account with the Service under a different name or address. In exceptional cases, a customer's account may be unblocked before the self-exclusion period expires."</p>
<p>Is support-en@888starz.bet the email address where your requests have been sent to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
