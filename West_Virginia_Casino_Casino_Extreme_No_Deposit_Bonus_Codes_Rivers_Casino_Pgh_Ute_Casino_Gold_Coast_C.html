<p>In anticipation of its grand opening on December 13, Fontainebleau Las Vegas, the dazzling resort nestled on the northern stretch of the iconic Las Vegas Strip, has announced pivotal additions to its leadership team.</p>
<p>Fontainebleau Las Vegas Welcomes New CFO and CAO</p>
<p>John Helderman, a distinguished professional with 25 years of experience in gaming, finance, and accounting, has been appointed chief financial officer of the resort. Accompanying him in the top ranks is Stacie Michaels, who has been promoted from general counsel to chief administrative officer, expanding her responsibilities to encompass legal, risk management, internal audit, compliance, and workers’ compensation functions within the organization.</p>
<p>Mark Tricano, President of Fontainebleau Las Vegas, expressed his confidence in the newly appointed executives, stating: “As we near our global debut, we are developing a successful culture under the guidance and perspective of seasoned leaders in gaming and beyond.”</p>
<p>He emphasized the invaluable expertise that Helderman and Michaels bring to the resort. Their deep understanding of the Las Vegas market and their exceptional leadership skills align seamlessly with the vision of Fontainebleau Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Fontainebleau Las Vegas, the highly anticipated 67-story casino resort on the iconic Las Vegas Strip, is to open its doors to the public on Wednesday, December 13. Despite facing delays due to economic challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic, the resort, acquired by Fontainebleau Development and Koch Industries in 2021, secured a $2.2 billion loan last year, ensuring the completion of the ambitious project.</p>
<p>Michaels and Helderman Elevate Resort’s Leadership</p>
<p>Having previously served as chief financial officer for The Brennan Entities, a prominent Las Vegas-based financial services operator, and in a similar capacity for Bluberi Gaming, a leading slot company, John Helderman brings a wealth of experience to his new role. His track record also includes stints as vice president of finance for multiple Las Vegas Strip resorts. Helderman is a graduate of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce’s Leadership Las Vegas Class of 2022.</p>
<p>Stacie Michaels, a legal luminary, transitioned into her elevated role at Fontainebleau Las Vegas after a decade-long tenure in various capacities within the Las Vegas gaming and hospitality industries. Michaels, a graduate of New York Law School, earned recognition as one of Vegas Inc.’s “40 Under 40” in 2017. Apart from her professional achievements, she actively contributes to the community, serving on the board of trustees for Discovery Children’s Museum and the Meadows School.</p>
<p>Fontainebleau Las Vegas recently strengthened its senior-level team. Mark Tricano, a veteran with extensive experience in hospitality, gaming, and finance, was appointed as the resort’s president. Michelle Reda, another industry expert with over two decades of experience, took on the role of chief casino marketing officer, while Kimberly Virtuoso, who contributed significantly to the resort’s human resources strategy, was promoted to senior vice president of people.</p>
