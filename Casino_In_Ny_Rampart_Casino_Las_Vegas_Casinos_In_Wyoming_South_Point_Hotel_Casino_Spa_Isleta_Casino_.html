<p>Clarion Gaming has vowed to “reimagine learning” as it unveiled that new learning segments and masterclasses are on its list for the ICE VOX 2022 conference.</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming Doubles Down on Learning</p>
<p>The ICE VOX 2022 gaming conference will see Clarion Gaming host several masterclasses on the hottest topics across the gaming industry. A total of 12 masterclasses, each focused on an important gambling topic, will follow the important International Casino Conference and the World Regulatory Briefing.</p>
<p>The classes will cover things that interest both the online and the land-based gaming industries, with materials for consumer journey, customer acquisition, reputation management, responsible gambling, and vertical integration. Clarion Gaming will also talk about some of the key markets, such as the United States and Latin America, and their notable aspects.</p>
<p>The classes are scheduled for February 1 and 2, a day after the ICC and WRB. They will take place in the ExCeL exhibition and international convention center in London. Each masterclass will host no more than 50 participants and only the participants will be able to actively participate in the discussions.</p>
<p>Samani Explains The More Focused Approach</p>
<p>Pooja Samani, the head of production at Clarion Gaming, shared that the next year’s format has been changed to have more focused topics that open the opportunity for fruitful discussion. He added that the changes have been thoughtfully consulted with Clarion’s stakeholder community and are all with goals of delivering “the exceptional content ICE VOX is famous for but in a more user-friendly and flexible format.” Samani further explained:</p>
<p>“We have worked to create a focused program that allows delegates to select and participate in more intimate discussions that drive into the details of key business issues, without interfering with their exhibition and meeting schedule on the show floor.” Clarion Gaming head of production Pooja Samani</p>
