<p>Jordan vs. South Korea is a semifinal duel of the 2024 Asian Cup, which will take place at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar, on Tuesday, February 6, 2024</p>
<p>South Korea’s journey to the 2023 Asian Cup semifinal has been unexpectedly difficult, with their last two games being decided after the regular 90 minutes. Are we going to see Heung-Min Son and his teammates struggle again?</p>
<p>They’re seen as betting favorites in the Jordan vs. South Korea game, but they’ve played against this opponent in the group stage of the 2024 Asian Cup – the game finished with no winners with 2-2 on the scoreboard.</p>

<p>Jordan Going for Glory at Asian Cup</p>
<p>Reaching the semifinal stage of the Asian Cup meant breaking the national record for Jordan. This is the first time this team has reached the final four. Can they take it a step further?</p>
<p>They sure have the motivation to do so. However, their roster just doesn’t seem great. In fact, most of their players play in Jordan’s domestic league. There are a couple who play in other countries in the Middle East with their most-capped midfielder, Mousa Al-Tamari, being the only player who plays in Europe.</p>
<p>So, how did they get to the semifinal? Their schedule wasn’t too difficult, although they did have to play against some real heavyweights, most notably, South Korea. These two met in the group stage and the final score was 2-2.</p>
<p>It was a strange game, in which Jordan had a 2-1 lead until stoppage time when one of their players scored an own goal.</p>
<p>South Korea’s Asian Cup Games are Super-Fun to Watch</p>
<p>These guys have been very entertaining to watch since coming to Qatar. Not if you’re their fan, though. South Korea’s fans have had a lot of things to worry about throughout this tournament, with their boys making all kinds of mistakes that, luckily, did not prove costly for them.</p>

<p>In fact, every time they struggled, South Korea’s players somehow found a way to come on top. In their most recent game, for example, they defeated Australia 2-1 after extra time. Before that, they beat Saudi Arabia after penalties.</p>
<p>They haven’t been too impressive so far, but no one can deny that South Korea’s roster is fantastic. Led by Heung-Min Son, these guys look capable of beating almost any team in Asia. Does Jordan fall into this category?</p>
<p>Jordan vs. South Korea Prediction</p>
<p>South Korea is just levels above Jordan in terms of player quality. We think they’re going to win this game but based on what we’ve seen from them so far, we think they’re going to struggle. We can see them allowing a goal or two, which is why our pick is South Korea &amp; Over 2.5 Goals.</p>
<p>Pick: South Korea &amp; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
