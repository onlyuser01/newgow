    <h1>Gold Country Casino Atlantis Casino Buffet Casino In Queens Osceola Iowa Casino Parx Casino Pragmati</h1>

<p>The leading online gambling content provider has sealed the new deal with the Peruvian operator, thus agreeing to give customers in the country access to its top-tier content</p>
<p>The offering includes a large number of Live Casino, Virtual Sports, and Slots options that already count among the favorites of many players in Latin America. Plus, Pentagol players will also get unrestricted access to a series of freshly released games.</p>
<p>What Will the New Deal Bring to Peruvian Players?</p>
<p>Newly launched slots like Fury of Odin Megaways and Reel Banks together with award-winning games like Gates of Olympus and Sugar Rush will all become accessible to players in Peru via the Pentagol platform. The terms of the agreement also include access to Pragmatic Play’s versatile selection of Live Casino options that feature staple games such as Mega Wheel and Sweet Bonanza CandyLand.</p>
<p>Sports betting aficionados on one of the most globally active markets will also be given access to Greyhound Racing, Horse Racing, Force 1, and other popular Virtual Sports verticals. Pragmatic Play is known for its excellent 3D renderings rich in details and generous access to a large selection of betting markets.</p>
<p>Pentagol “Couldn’t Be Happier” About the Deal</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s vice president of Latin American operations Victor Arias expressed their delight at welcoming Pentagol to its roster of “valued partners”. He described their platform as an “ideal” one that would allow their content to improve its positioning in the gaming market in Peru.</p>
<p>Pentagol’s operations manager José Tornero also spoke about the new deal, calling the large number of new games brought by the deal “hugely important” for their expansion plans. Tornero added that Pentagol “couldn’t be happier” about the new content agreement, calling Pragmatic Play’s titles “a must-have for any operator” in the country where players rely on accessing top-tier games.</p>
<p>Plus, the association with the provider that generates up to seven fresh slots on a monthly basis will allow the company to stay competitive in this fast-growing market. In October 2022, Pragmatic Play signed a similar content deal with Atlantis Games, another Peruvian operator.</p>
<p>Last December, Pragmatic Play announced two similar content delivery deals with JK Bet and BetBastet in Brazil. According to the terms of the new strategic agreements, the provider would boost its presence in the country’s regulated gambling market while leveraging the experience and implementing a similar growth strategy for new markets in LatAm.</p>
