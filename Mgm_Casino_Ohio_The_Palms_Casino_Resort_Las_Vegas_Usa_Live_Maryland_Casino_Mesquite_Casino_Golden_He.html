<p>"Good morning my name is David and I won 3000eur at the zodiac casino without a bonus..but when there was a payout there was a problem I got a message from them right from me confiscating the win because I broke the rules. While I read all the rules. I own all the documents. I sent them OP VP just what the casino asks LED comes to the payout, so they wanted to leave the ATM account at home, I asked them if I could give a skrill account to friends because I had already played a few times at other casinos such as royalvegas.eu and 0reto I put it on his skrill account because the money will run on the skrill account7 odaco faster than on the bank than I wrote above at other casinos when I win and when choosing I asked 9ch if I can give friends to skrill casino they wrote me down yes but they had the conditions that my friend and I had to have a contract signed by him and a lot of scanned to send them verified everything went well, but what annoys me the most from the zodiac and Yukon gold casino I would he called it one and the same casino, but rewards ... before the progress I won at yukone gold also a bigger win exactly the same thing I wrote above I just asked them if I could skrill friends .. they wrote me out of course they verified everything paid off no problem . But now I have also won a bigger win on the zodiac, I asked them about the skrill or I can ask my friends ... and here is the biggest fail I think. As if they are such a correct casino, I will write right away, no, because such a thing would happen. Please, nice, they wrote to me normally, so that I could write a friend's account, I also wrote it to them. My accounts were blocked for both zodiac and yukone. I try to communicate with them, but they also immediately disconnect or write me nonsensical e-mails, which I should contact when I have any questions. And it doesn't hurt to give me space just to tell them why ... and I shouldn't have the problem to send that bank account if m8 writes NO ALL THE INFORMATION MUST BE THE SAME WITH YOUR NAME. And I would actually say that I was robbed, I charged for 10 euros without a bonus. I won 3000eur. And they made me so disgusting. I hope you can help me! I donated all the winnings that I won to my mother's SISTER, who had her daughter. THANK YOU .DÃ¡vid "</p>
