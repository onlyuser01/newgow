<p>MGM continues to reopen casino-free properties and Delano Las Vegas is next on the list with reopening planned for July 1. At the same time all of the company’s venues operate under enhanced health and safety protocols ensuring the wellbeing of employees and guests.</p>
<p>Delano Las Vegas – MGM’s Hotel Property to Reopen on July 1</p>
<p>MGM’s Delano Las Vegas casino-free property will reopen for visitors on July 1, the company announced earlier this week. This is yet another MGM hotel property in Las Vegas to reopen doors. So far the casino-free properties which have already reopened are the Bellagio, MGM Grand, New York-New York and Excalibur. Delano’s connected property – Mandalay Bay will also reopen on July 1 as well as ARIA. Another MGM property is also planned to reopen next week. The 30-story pyramid Luxor Hotel &amp; Casino will begin accepting guests on June 25.</p>
<p>All of the hotels, casinos and other “non-essential” businesses were closed in mid-March as part of the government’s effort to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. Back in May, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak did not include the casino industry as a part of Phase 1 of the reopening plan of the state. This however changed with Phase 2 in early June when casino operators and other non-essential businesses were allowed to reopen.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts’ CEO and president, Bill Hornbuckle commented by saying: “We are pleased to bring more employees back to work.” He added that the company continues to monitor business demand. At the same time, MGM has already built the necessary planning and will be able to reopen additional resorts, said Hornbuckle. He did not miss to say that the reopening of properties and rebuilding of the company’s workforce is of critical importance for the community.</p>
<p>MGM Casinos and Hotels Operate Under Enhanced Health and Safety Protocols</p>
<p>The MGM properties, similar to other casinos, hotels and “non-essential” venues, operate under strict health and safety protocols. According to MGM Resorts, the wellbeing of their guests and employees is a top priority while many of the properties reopen for visitors. Announced back in May, the MGM shared its “Seven-Point Safety Plan“ which outlines how the company’s venues will operate in the post-COVID-19 environment.</p>
<p>According to the seven-point safety plan, the company now carries out screening of their employees as well as temperature checks. Guests are also asked similar screening questions upon arrival and during their stay at any of the properties. Masks and other personal protective equipment are mandatory for MGM employees. Guests are also going to be encouraged to wear masks. In fact, Nevada already ordered mandatory face coverings for all patrons earlier this week. In case they don’t have it, a mask can be provided for free. Social distancing of six-foot is implemented. Where possible, MGM has installed plexiglass spacers or provided face shields for its employees. Enhanced sanitation of all high-touch surfaces and common areas has been implemented by MGM.</p>
<p>As per the plan by MGM, Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) controls ensure air quality. Incident response protocols are implemented by MGM in order to ensure reducing of eventual COVID-19 infection spread. Last but not least, guests of MGM can experience contactless options which include cashless payments and digital menus.</p>
