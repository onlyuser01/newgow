<p>The next US Darts Masters is scheduled to run from May 31 to June 1</p>
<p>The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) announced an extended partnership with bet365. Under a new sponsorship agreement, the gambling operator will once again back the next World Series of Darts tournament in New York.</p>
<p>Bet365 has been the title sponsor of the US Darts Masters for two years now, supporting the event ever since it moved to The Theater at Madison Square Garden. Under the agreement with the operator, the event has been known as the bet365 US Darts Masters and is one of the World Series of Darts’ biggest and most popular events.</p>
<p>The US Darts Masters is an event where eight top PDC stars face off against eight North American competitors across two days. The event was most recently won by Michael van Gerwen who claimed the champion’s title in 2023 after scoring a significant victory against Jeff Smith at Madison Square Garden. In 2022, the event was won by Michael Smith.</p>
<p>Both van Gerwen and Michael Smith are set to return to the New York event in 2024. The next US Darts Masters is scheduled to run from May 31 to June 1.</p>
<p>Bet365 will also remain the title sponsor of the North American Championship, which will be held on June 1 and will see eight US players challenge eight Canadian pros.</p>
<p>Tickets for the two events will go on sale from December 4.</p>
<p>PDC Is Glad to Have Secured bet365’s Support</p>
<p>PDC’s chief executive officer, Matt Porter, remarked that the US Darts Masters is one of the most popular World Series of Darts events. Because of that, his team is delighted to be working with bet365 and to have secured the operator’s support for the two events.</p>
<p>Porter added that his team is looking forward to once again hosting the US Darts Masters and the North American Championship.</p>
<p>The Theater at Madison Square Garden has become a real home for these events; we’ve enjoyed a fantastic atmosphere in the last two years and anticipation is already building for our return in 2024. Matt Porter, CEO, PDC</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a bet365 spokesperson expressed the company’s excitement about the partnership with PDC, saying that its events have become a staple for fans of the sport.</p>
