<p>Effective Thursday, August 24, FanDuel Sportsbook bettors have access to lines on pickleball tournaments on the Professional Pickleball Association Tour (PPAT). The PPAT bills itself as the “elite tour” for professional pickleball.</p>
<p>Bettors can wager on match winners, correct match scores, total points (over/under), and head-to-head. FanDuel’s pickleball lines are live in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington, and Wyoming. The sportsbook is awaiting pickleball approval in several other states.</p>
<p>FanDuel, PPAT officials hope, is just the first major U.S. sportsbook to pick up its tournaments.</p>
<p>“This is a monumental moment for the PPA Tour and the game of pickleball as a whole,” declared PPA Tour Founder and CEO Connor Pardoe. “We are excited to be paving the way in the pickleball sports betting space, and we couldn’t be prouder to lead the sport’s leap into such an innovative industry.”</p>
<p>Pardoe believes allowing fans to bet on pickleball will only further grow the sport, which in recent years has been one of the fastest-growing sports in the US.</p>
<p>The Association of Pickleball Professionals estimates there are 36.5 million pickleball players in the US, and participation has grown nearly 160% over the past three years. Players aged 18-34 account for the largest percentage of pickleball players at 29% nationwide.</p>
<p>Official Pickleball Data Stream</p>
<p>To ensure sportsbooks have the most up-to-date and accurate information, the PPAT has partnered with Genius Sports to provide a real-time data stream to participating sportsbooks. Genius Sports is a leading sports data firm in the sports gaming space.</p>
<p>For pickleball, Genius Sports isn’t only a statistical feeder to sportsbooks but is also providing “low latency” or minimally delayed streaming footage of PPAT matches. Sportsbooks can choose to offer streaming content to bettors for increased engagement.</p>
<p>To ensure game integrity, the PPAT has partnered with Sportradar, a leading monitor of sports betting activity. Sportradar’s bet monitoring and detection services are used by more than 160 sportsbooks and gaming firms worldwide.</p>
<p>The PPAT has also formulated a Sports Betting and Integrity Policy that all players, officials, and staff must adhere to. All persons involved in PPAT events must complete an online course educating them about the sport’s betting policy.</p>
<p>Pickleball Coming to Las Vegas</p>
<p>The PPA Tour is sponsored by Carvana, the online used car retailer. With the major sponsorship, the PPA Tour said it paid a record $5.5 million in purses last year.</p>
<p>The 2023 PPA Tour consists of 25 events across the country. The PPA Tour comes to Las Vegas next month for the Guaranteed Rate PPA Championships Presented by Thorlo. The tournament runs Oct. 5-8 at the Darling Tennis Center in Summerlin.</p>
<p>The PPA Tour returns to Sin City for All-Star Week at Mandalay Bay in December. The December 14-17 tour stop will air live on the Tennis Channel.</p>
<p>With pickleball continuing to increase in popularity, more and more Las Vegas guests are seeking out courts during their stays. Pickleball courts can be found at several parks around town, including Sunset Park, southeast of Harry Reid International Airport.</p>
<p>The downtown Plaza Hotel Casino has one of the largest pickleball complexes, with 12 permanent courts. The pickleball courts are located at the casino’s rooftop pool complex.</p>
