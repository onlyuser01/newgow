<p>BankCard Services, an American credit card processor founded in 2014, has announced a new agreement with LoopGolf, a digital wallet for golf wagering.</p>
<p>BCS to Manage LoopGolf’s Cashless Accounts</p>
<p>In an announcement on September 19, BankCard Services confirmed LoopGolf as its new cashless gaming client. The agreement will see BankCard Services and the Bank of George Gaming FinTech division power their new client with cashless solutions.</p>
<p>BankCard Services and the Bank of George will leverage their Pooled Player Account Powered by PIMS solution to manage cashless betting accounts for the golf betting company. The agreement will help LoopGolf in its mission to simplify real money wagers in professional golf.</p>
<p>LoopGolf’s digital wallet solution is a product that sits at the intersection of fintech, sports and culture. The app is available for download on the App Store and provides customers with on-course coordinating, scoring and settling of real money wagers. Thanks to the agreement with BankCard Services, the app will be able to double down on cashless payments.</p>
<p>LoopGolf Believes BCS and Bank of George to Be the Perfect Partners</p>
<p>LoopGolf’s chief product officer, Matt Rum, said that his team wanted to build a digital wallet for true golf enthusiasts. To that end, LoopGolf had to embed payment settlement for on-course wagers to its wallet. Rum noted that his team concluded BankCard Services and Bank of George would be the perfect partners for his company in order for LoopGolf to deliver the experience it wants to its customers.</p>
<p>BCS and Bank of George were the perfect partners for us in order to enable the experience we want for our customers and ensure our customers’ funds are secure with a financial institution. In addition, this partnership enables us to scale our operations and build our future roadmap with a financial institution already on our side. Matt Rum, CPO, LoopGolf</p>
<p>Hanan Sabri, president and chief operating officer at BankCard Services, also shared her thoughts. She noted that her company is looking forward to working with LoopGolf and supplying it with the proprietary Pooled Player Account Powered by PIMS solution.</p>
<p>BCS is excited to announce that LoopGolf has engaged us and our Sponsor Bank, Bank of George, to provide our proprietary “Pooled Player Account Powered by PIMSTM” product to manage their cashless wagering account for the LoopGolf players. Hanan Sabri, COO, BCS</p>
<p>The Pooled Player Account powered by PIMS solution previously helped with the initial launch of the Oregon State Lottery.</p>
