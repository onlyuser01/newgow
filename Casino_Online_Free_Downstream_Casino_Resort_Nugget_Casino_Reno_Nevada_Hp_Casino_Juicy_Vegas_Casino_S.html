<p>SBC Events is proud to present the latest major stop on the gambling industry’s calendar with SBC Summit Rio now confirmed for March 5-7, 2024, and to be held at the Windsor Barra Hotel, a five-star venue worthy of the industry gathering.</p>
<p>The conference will focus on the emerging and fast-evolving iGaming and sports betting markets in Brazil, a country that is touted to be one of the most significant markets for the industry moving forward.</p>
<p>Brazil has a population of more than 217 million people and it is now in the midst of rapid reregulation that has enabled many companies to pursue growth in the jurisdiction. The potential remains significant, and SBC Events is hosting the Rio de Janeiro event to help steer and guide stakeholders.</p>
<p>Commenting on the arrival of this new event, a number of interested stakeholders have spoken, offering their two pence on why SBC Summit Rio would be that important. EstrelaBet Chief Business Officer Fellipe Fraga who said:</p>
<p>"I absolutely love SBC Events, especially SBC Summit Latinoamérica! The quality of the organization and the incredible sense of community among attendees is truly amazing. As a Brazilian-focused operator, actively expanding our presence in the region and supporting local clubs, having a dedicated event for Brazil is beyond exciting. And with SBC behind it, the event becomes even more priceless. This is all perfectly aligned with our company’s current focus."</p>
<p>The event was welcomed by other prominent stakeholders, including Better Collective and Sportradar. Sportradar EVP Global Marketing Adam Azor described this new gathering as yet another opportunity to network and bring together a high-profile event that will offer benefits to all delegates. Azor hailed SBC Events’ proactive stance in deciding to host an event in Brazil that meets the need for such important gatherings in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Rasmus Sojmark, SBC CEO &amp; Founder, spoke of the significance of the event and what it is intended to achieve, speaking also of his organization’s ties with iGaming and sports betting in Brazil:</p>
<p>"Our engagement with the Brazilian market is far from new. In 2022, SBC made a significant impact in São Paulo by hosting The Brazil Football Expo in partnership with the Brazilian Football Confederation. Moreover, earlier this year, we launched the SBC Notícias Brasil news platform as the magnitude of opportunities in this market cannot be overlooked."</p>
<p>He said that the upcoming gathering will offer a robust platform for professionals who are keen on finding out the best practices at a time when the regulatory landscape is altering rapidly. The SBC Summit Rio is supported by AIEJA, IBIA, Fecoljuegos, IAGA, and American Gaming Association, among others. There will be more than 2,000 delegates attending along with 800 operators, 250 affiliates, 100 speakers, and more than 50 exhibitors.</p>
