<p>Global betting powerhouse Betsson announced that it will serve as the official sponsor of the upcoming 26th IHF Women’s World Championship 2023, brokered by SPORTFIVE. The arrangement affirms the operator’s commitment to supporting women’s sports.</p>
<p>The championship’s group stage will be hosted by Sweden, Norway and Denmark and will engage sports fans from November 29 to December 17 this year. As noted by Betsson, the draw took place yesterday, July 6, in Gothenburg. The final, meanwhile, is set to take place in Herning, Denmark.</p>
<p>The event will welcome 32 national teams. At the time of Betsson’s announcement, Norway led the operator’s odds list, followed by Denmark in third and Sweden in fifth place.</p>
<p>The current sponsorship deal is Betsson’s first sponsorship in handball and will expand the operator’s presence in professional sports. The company has been supporting sports in the Nordic region since 1963 and is happy to continue and expand its sports initiatives.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Betsson’s branding will feature on the led screens across the handball arena. The operator will also give away tickets for the event and will offer a wide range of odds for the matches.</p>
<p>While this is Betsson’s first time supporting a handball event, it is not its first time supporting women’s sports. The company has previously served as the exclusive sportsbook partner of the CONMEBOL Copa América Femenina 2022 and the main sponsor of Athletico Paranaense and Club Atletico Boca Juniors’s women’s teams.</p>
<p>Betsson Wants to Support Women’s Sports</p>
<p>IHF’s president, Dr Hassan Moustafa, welcomed Betsson as the partner of the 26th IHF Women’s World Championship. He thanked the operator for its commitment and said that the two parties will now have a clear aim – “to excite.”</p>
<p>SPORTFIVE’s chief growth officer, Robert Müller von Vultejus, said that he considers Betsson to be a valued partner. He noted that the operator’s experience with female leagues made it a perfect partner for the handball championship.</p>
<p>With their [Betsson’s] wealth of experience in supporting women’s sports globally we are confident that this collaboration will further elevate the excitement and bring the tournament to new height. Robert Müller von Vultejus, chief growth officer, SPORTFIVE</p>
<p>Finally, Betsson Group’s PR manager, Robin Olenius, said that the sponsorship reflects his team’s desire to promote and support women’s sports.</p>
<p>We hope that through our support of the tournament and our global presence, we will help to increase the excitement globally”, says Robin Olenius, PR Manager Betsson Group. Robin Olenius, PR manger, Betsson Group</p>
<p>Recently, Betsson strengthened its horse racing content thanks to a partnership with PA Betting Services.</p>
