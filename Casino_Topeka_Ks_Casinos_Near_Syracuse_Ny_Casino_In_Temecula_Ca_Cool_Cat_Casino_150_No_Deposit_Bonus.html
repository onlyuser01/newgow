    <h1>Casino Topeka Ks Casinos Near Syracuse Ny Casino In Temecula Ca Cool Cat Casino 150 No Deposit Bonus</h1>

<p>Hi - Until 04-05-2020 i had lost 24892,51€ Euros on gg.bet as a gambling addict. Here i reached out to the live-chat at gg.bet, where i very clearly informed that i had lost big amounts, and that i was very likely to loss all my winnings before they we're withdrawn in your casino, and after a long chat i very specifically agreed with your chat to block my account (After a long chat with the chat-operator we together agreed to close my account for 60 days), after they changed my mind from permanent account closure to 60 days, as shown on chat-screenshots i have.</p>
<p>I had already mentioned to GG.bet's chat that i wanted a break and that i had been having big losses, when having lost 24892,51€. Some deposits as high as 1248,61€ and 1338,97€ each, and some as low as 4,48€ when that was all i had left until i got some more funds by loans.</p>
<p>In the correspondance with John the chat-operator at 04-05-2020, we had already an agreement, where he changed my mind from permanently account closure to taking a 60-days break, he very clearly confirmed in the correspondance the we was glad that i decided only to block my account for 60-days, as he informed me "When the account is permanently blocked, there will be no turning back, and you may regret such a radical decision in the future." So he talked me out of this and into a 60 days block to clear my mind. He confirmed my decision in the chat, and told me just to write an email to confirm that it was me, and he very clearly wrote that it was just a formality, so i send an email confirming my account block.</p>
<p>After a long chat (as attached) with the chat-operator, we together found a solution that i agreed that we do not close my account permanently, but block my account for 60 days, so i could think the situation after the losses as recommended by chat operator. He agreed with me, and when i wrote to him "Then we do not close my account permanently, but instead just for a period", he responded with "I am glad that we agreed on that." afterwise i confirmed i wanted 60 days closed, and he confirmed to me "As you wish" and he informed me i just had to confirm to me that "it was just a formality to confirm that we are talking with the real account owner".</p>
<p>In this situation there was no reason for the casino to intervene this decision the day after, and talk me to keep my account active since i had already agreed with chat-operator that i needed a break and i wanted my account closed, just after i lost and wanted a break. It is very clear in the attached chat-correspondance, John the chat-supporter both agreed and confirmed my request. John the chat-operator very clearly confirmed my request and he confirmed that the email confirmation i had to send, was just a formality, therefore there was no reason for GG.bet to try to change my mind, since we have on chat that John the char-operator talked me into 60-days account block, he confirmed my final choice of blocking my account for 60 days and he confirmed very clearly that the email confirmation i had to sent was just a formality. Therefore the casino should have closed my account for 60 days, which would have prevented me from taking another loan and gamble and lose 15.000€ Euros within the next month, as we agreed on account block, and that the casino had already earned 24892,51€ Euros on my losses before this.</p>
<p>I cannot see how it could be done in any other way, i contact the chat-support expressing my losses and request for account closure, they instantly try to talk me into a temporary block, and after discussing the details we finally agree that i take 60 days break to get away from gambling and to think the situation through. I sent an email confirming this, so there was no need for the casino to intervene and try to change my mind the day after, since the casino had already earned almost 25000€ before this, and i already had discussed all the details and situation with the chat-supporter.</p>
