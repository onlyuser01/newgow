    <h1>Ip Casino Casino Guru Casino Illinois Casino In Nashua Nh Tuscany Suites Casinos Casinoin The player</h1>

<p>Dear andandjonnyx,</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying. I can understand that you might feel that your user experience with Casinoin was not the best, however, the fact is that the casino is entitled to request the documents, as I have previously stated.</p>
<p>You agreed with the casino's terms and conditions when you created your casino account. The casino has this stated in its terms and conditions:</p>
<p>J. INVALIDATION OF TRANSACTIONS/FRAUD/ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING</p>
<ol>
<li>For fraud prevention purposes when making payments, including by bank cards or by other payment means, disputing the payments by third parties and investigating such cases, the Company can verify all payments. In such case the Client must provide upon request the following documents:</li>
</ol>
<p>2.1. for establishing your identity and/or verification of your age, your identification documents,</p>
<p>2.2. for verification of your address, a bank statement, utility bill, or other documents,</p>
<p>2.3. for the validation of a payment transaction or a withdrawal of funds, the documents requested by our partners - payment systems or agents, in accordance with the professional requirements for combating money laundering and illegal financial transactions.</p>
<p>As well as</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon the Company's request, the Client shall provide other documents necessary for the verification of payment (including in the case of a request for a refund)...</li>
</ol>
<p>So please understand that the casino is entitled to request such documents, and it is your responsibility to provide the required documents to the casino. We can't punish the casino for such industry-standard rules.</p>
<p>As you have confirmed that you have successfully finished the verification and have received your withdrawal, we consider your initial issue to be resolved.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if you feel that you are not fully satisfied with the outcome for some reason, but we can't classify this complaint as unresolved as it has in reality been solved.</p>
<p>After gathering all the information, we consider this complaint to be finished, and no further actions are needed. You have successfully finished the verification and have received your withdrawal. That's why we can close this complaint either as Resolved or Reject it as Unjustified.</p>
<p>Please let me know which of these two classifications you consider the most suitable.</p>
