<p>Design Works Gaming has signed a new content deal with 888casino which will allow the company to launch its portfolio of iGaming titles with one of the leading UK operators. The result of this partnership should see 888casino enhance its content offer with distinct products developed in-house by Design Works Gaming and bringing fresh gameplay features.</p>
<p>Design Works Gaming Launches Content with Established UK Casino Brand</p>
<p>Some of the products featured here will include Double Fancy 7s, Armadillo Artie Gone Wild, and more. More games will be coming in the coming months, the companies confirmed. Design Works Gaming is going to inject its content through Light &amp; Wonder’s Open Gaming platform.</p>
<p>888casino is one of the first online casino brands in the UK market and as such it provides Design Works Gaming with a unique opportunity to position its product in the country’s iGaming ecosystem and achieve visibility. Design Works Gaming CEO Troy Zurawski commented on this tie-up and said:</p>
<p>Adding 888 to our roster further validates DWG’s games as some of the highest performing in the industry. Design Works Gaming CEO Troy Zurawski</p>
<p>The executive continued by adding that 888casino was an outstanding partner which was laser-focused on the quality of the content. As such, there is hardly a better match for Design Works Gaming, Zurawski assured.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to what we can glean from their unique business strategies to bring the best to 888 players,” he concluded. Design Works Gaming does work with a number of other brands, though, including Betfred, Unibet, William Hill, and others.</p>
<p>Expanding with Confidence in the UK and Beyond</p>
<p>Commenting on the most recent partnership, 888casino VP B2C of casino Talya Benyamini said that the company was excited to be teaming up with Design Works Gaming and introducing the developer’s unique gameplay and mechanics to 888’s player base.</p>
<p>“Content leadership is critical for our business, and we can’t wait to bring the incredible DWG content to our main markets around the world,” Benyamini remarked. Design Works Gaming previously launched with Mr Green in the UK market back in May.</p>
<p>The studio has also been seeking expansion across the pond in the United States where the company has gone live in Connecticut, Michigan, and Pennsylvania as part of a broader ambition to enter more markets.</p>
