<p>Ontario’s regulated gaming industry is set to launch on April 4 and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) wants to make sure that everything will run smoothly. Hence, it issued a warning to casino operators to cease all activities while they are in the process of acquiring a license.</p>
<p>Companies That Do Not Comply Will Face the Consequences</p>
<p>As AGCO noted, companies that are in the process of acquiring a license but do not comply with the new guidelines will face the risk of having their license rejected. Apart from the guidelines on potential licensees, AGCO also lays out plans to address the remaining unregulated gambling market in Ontario. The law enforcement of the province will assist the commission in its efforts.</p>
<p>These efforts are made to make sure that Ontario’s transition to the regulated gambling market runs as smoothly as possible. After all, a lot of effort went into the legalization of the industry. Ontario’s government revealed its plans to end the monopoly that the online lottery had back in 2019.</p>
<p>Legislation that would allow a licensing regime was introduced in 2020 and in September 2021, the province published the standards for online gaming and betting. Ban on auto-play and a minimum speed for slot spins of 2.5 seconds were among the rules.</p>
<p>Numerous Operators and Suppliers Were Licensed Recently</p>
<p>So far, AGCO issued numerous licenses to both casino operators and game providers. The most recent operator that got a license was LeoVegas, which is a huge development for the casino that continues to follow its growth plans under the motto “bigger is better.”</p>
<p>What’s even better, Play’n GO, which is considered by many as one of the best game providers in the world, also obtained a license. The CCO of Play’n GO, Magnus Olsson, stated that regulated markets are important to both the company and the “industry as a whole.”</p>
<p>He also added that Ontario is home to 40% of Canada’s population and that is why the province is of such importance to Play’n GO. Olsson concluded by saying that Ontario is just the first step in Play’n GO’s strategy of expanding in the North American market. He noted that Play’n GO’s titles will soon be available in some US jurisdictions for the first time.</p>
<p>A couple of days before Play’n GO managed to secure a license, Gaming Realms was also given the green light via its subsidiary Alchemybet Limited. PokerStars, a leading global poker room, confirmed that it is planning to launch its services in the province and is currently collaborating with regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>A PokerStars spokesperson stated that the poker room’s licensing will be historic and a statement from the company read that Canada is very close to its heart as it represents the ground where PokerStars was born over 2 decades ago.</p>
