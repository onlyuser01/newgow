<p>Gaming Laboratories International (GLI) Africa has reached a massive achievement as it hits 100 South Africa-based employees, which will support the company’s customers in the African continent and beyond. Customer demand has been increasing in this region in the past year as GLI Africa hired 58 more team members.</p>
<p>GLI Africa’s Operations Started in 1996</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art lab and office of GLI Africa opened its doors in Johannesburg in 2017 and in order to accommodate the new team, it expanded by over 4,000 square feet (400 square meters).</p>
<p>Devon Dalbock, GLI Africa’s general manager, stated that GLI was the first gaming hub to set up shop in South Africa in 1996, and back then, the company had “a handful of employees.” He went on to say that GLI has invested a lot of money and effort since then and that is why this milestone is such a massive achievement.</p>
<p>Dalbock also touched on the fact that the company is proud to have retained all staff during the pandemic and not only that, but it also managed to create a lot of new job opportunities not just in Africa, but all across the world. Finally, Dalbock noted that it is great for customers in Africa to know that they have “access to local experts” that fully understand all of the challenges that the African market brings.</p>
<p>GLI Africa’s story is packed with success stories. Shortly after setting up in 1996, the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS) awarded it ISO 17025 accreditation. Then, in 2007, GLI Africa became a fully owned subsidiary of GLI.</p>
<p>The Midrand, Johannesburg lab opened in 2017 and in 2021, GLI Africa hired 58 new employees and established a Math Analysis team.</p>
<p>GLI Signifies the Fact that Every Employee is Important</p>
<p>Apart from rapidly expanding and hiring new team members in its Africa subsidiary, GLI is known for rewarding those that show commitment and dedication. Towards the end of May, the company announced the promotions of Malvina Mikaelian and Kelly Myers who became the new director of the engineering department and manager of client solutions, respectively.</p>
<p>As for GLI Africa, Kailin Hank was part of the historical achievement as she was the 100th employee at the subsidiary. She stated that when she first found out about the company, she was amazed by its work ethic and global commitment.</p>
<p>Hank added that one of the things that she adores about GLI is the fact that there’s a different opportunity to “learn and grow” with each passing day and that everyone is nice and friendly.</p>
<p>GLI’s global influence was further acknowledged at the SAGSE LatAm 2022 as the company was named the best laboratory for the second year in a row. Additionally, Karen Sierra-Hughes, the vice-president of Latin America and the Caribbean, was listed as one of the 5 top leaders in the land-based and online gambling industry.</p>
