<p>Mobius Plans to Reach New Global Markets</p>
<p>Online esports entertainment and gaming operator, Mobius Interactive, announced a 5 million share private placement on Monday this week. Price is CA$0.40 per share while the company seeks to raise some $2 million. According to Mobius, the bigger part of the raised amount will be allocated toward marketing campaigns for three of the biggest iGaming markets across the globe: India, Mexico, and Brazil.</p>
<p>Currently, the company operates across multiple markets throughout Europe and Scandinavia. Mobius offers sports fans its sportsbook, as well as an iGaming casino, live casino, and esports options. With that in mind, Mobius acknowledges that the iGaming industry is currently growing unprecedentedly. Furthermore, that industry growth was pushed by the lockdowns, which were a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In a statement, Lynn Pearce, CEO of Mobius, said that the company is confident that its commitment to product innovation and consumer excellence will result in a “solid foundation for success in existing and new markets“.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mobius’ VP of business development, Seamus Byrne, added that the iGaming market is positioned for tremendous growth this year. Additionally, he said that the iGaming market is already outperforming other markets. In conclusion, Byrne said that the opportunity to enter a new market that may potentially offer higher returns for investors is right now.</p>
<p>The company’s team of professionals has already proved to be successful in Europe and Scandinavia. Now, the company is in discussions with a licensed land-based casino, which operates in Mexico. Through such a partnership, Mobius would undoubtedly boost its entry into the regulated Mexican market by offering its online sportsbook and casino.</p>
