<p>The leading developer of products for the online gambling industry, CT Interactive, announced it expanded its European presence. The company revealed Wednesday that more of its products were certified in Spain, one of the major markets on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Certifying more content in Spain further expands the position of the leading developer in the country. At the same time, the certification boosts the company’s ongoing growth in Europe and around the globe. The recent certification brings popular games such as Monkey Sevens, Three Nymphs, Pick the Pig, Wizard Blizzard and Big Joker to customers in Spain. What’s more, the company’s Fluftails, Dark Woods, Hot 7’s X 2, Lord of Luck and Full of Luck games also achieved certification in Spain.</p>
<p>“We are proud to announce that 10 more games of our content have been certificated for a region as important as the Spanish.“ Milena Tsankarska, business development manager for EMEA at CT Interactive</p>
<p>Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive’s business development manager for EMEA, said that the company is proud to see more of its games achieve certification in Spain. Moreover, she acknowledged that the market and the region are significantly important for the company. Tsankarska added that the certification of additional games from the company is a testament to the quality and compliance of its products.</p>
<p>“The certified content is distinguished by sharp visuals, enthralling sounds, and great bonuses,“ added Tsankarska</p>
<p>According to Tsankarska, the new games stand out with quality graphics and sound effects. At the same time, she pointed out that the casino games offer great bonuses. The company’s business development manager for EMEA explained that Hot Luck offers an interactive jackpot that represents a unique engagement tool for operators. The jackpot itself enables customers online to unlock random mystery prizes, Tsankarska revealed. According to her, the innovative interactive jackpot is created to deliver excitement and boost fan engagement as well.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow Its Global Presence</p>
<p>The latest achievement in Spain comes after only recently, CT Interactive secured a similar certification for the Colombian market. This expanded the company’s presence in the country where it received certification for its Mystery Jackpot and more games, granting operators invaluable content and possibilities for customer retention and acquisition.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier this month, CT Interactive expanded its Latin American footprint by teaming up with the operator Slots Del Sol. As a result, the company delivered a list of 60 titles for the growing iGaming operator.</p>
