<p>Lazio vs. Celtic is one of the most interesting 2023-24 Champions League matchups scheduled for Tuesday, November 28</p>
<p>The Lazio vs. Celtic odds suggest the hosts are more likely to win. The Italians need a win to secure a spot in the next phase of the competition. Celtic’s motivation in Tuesday’s game is to stay in the competition for the No. 3 spot in Group E, which would take them to the Europa League knockout stage.</p>
<p>Winning points is the No. 1 motivation for both Lazio and Celtic, but there are a few other things that will make their players fired up in the November 28 duel.</p>
<p>The fans of these two teams don’t like each other very much. Lazio’s hardcore supporters are on the right end of the political spectrum, while Celtic’s fans are traditionally left-leaning.</p>
<p>That’s why we expect to hear a lot of noise coming from the 70,634-seat Stadio Olimpico. The support from the stands is bound to make everyone on the pitch go wild.</p>
<p>Further, Lazio’s players have an extra bit of motivation, which we’ll discuss in the next portion of our Lazio vs. Celtic UCL prediction.</p>

<p>Lazio Wants a Payback for the Loss(es) Four Years Ago</p>
<p>It was the fall of 2019 when Lazio and Celtic played two games in the Europa League. At the time, Lazio’s roster was packed with elite players, including Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Francesco Acerbi, and others who have since left the club. Plus, Ciro Immobile was in his prime four years ago.</p>
<p>The boys from the Italian capital were seen as one of the main favorites to win the competition, but Celtic decided to ruin their plans. Lazio ended in the third spot in the group, mainly due to losing both games with the Scottish heavyweight.</p>
<p>7th November 2019, Celtic beat Lazio 2:1 in Rome.</p>

<p>It’s the 2-1 loss at Rome’s Stadio Olimpico that hurt them the most. They had a 1-0 lead early on in the game but ended up losing with a goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Lazio did something in the Celtic vs. Lazio game this season, but they’d like to do it in front of their fans as well.</p>
<p>Lazio’s players have the motivation to beat Celtic on Tuesday, but their roster doesn’t look as strong as it was four years ago. The evidence of this is that they’re currently in the mid-section of the Serie A table.</p>
<p>In the Champions League, they’re currently second, but third-placed Feyenoord is breathing by their necks with just one point fewer. What this means is that if they failed to beat Celtic on November 28, they could drop down to third spot in Group E.</p>
<p>Celtic Needs a Win for the Ticket to the 2024 Europa League</p>
<p>Celtic is sitting at the bottom of the group table with just one point. The Hoops are five points behind Feyenoord, which is occupying the spot that leads to the knockout phase of the Europa League in 2024.</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot, but things aren’t over yet. There are two more rounds to be played, which means that Celtic could leapfrog the Dutch team. This is because they meet in Glasgow in the final round of the group phase of the 2023-24 UCL, while in this round, Feyenoord is taking on mighty Atletico Madrid.</p>
<p>In simple terms, if Celtic beats Lazio, the Scotts will almost certainly get to decide their Europa League destiny in the game with Feyenoord. That seems like good enough motivation for them, but do they have the player quality to actually pull it off?</p>
<p>Lazio vs. Celtic Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that this is going to be a real barnburner. Celtic’s players are coming to Rome to fight for all three points, but it’s Lazio that has better players. That said, we can see the two splitting points on Tuesday. It wouldn’t do much good to either team, but that scenario does seem most probable.</p>
