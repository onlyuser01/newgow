    <h1>River Rock Casino Vancouver Border Inn Casino Sonesta Maho Beach Resort Casino Palace Casino Borgata</h1>

<p>Baltimore’s Horseshoe Casino is the latest gambling facility that is getting ready for the highly anticipated launch of sports betting in Maryland. On Wednesday, the South Baltimore Casino announced that the first floor of the building will be converted into a next-level entertainment environment and that it will combine a sportsbook branded by the recently-launched Caesars Sportsbook, with an area consisting of reconfigured table games, as well as a new brewpub.</p>
<p>This casino in Baltimore is a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment, a giant in the US gambling industry that recently partnered with the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<p>The Brew Brothers Will Be One of the Main Features in the Sports Betting Area</p>
<p>The dining concept, named Brew Brothers, will be the sports betting area’s most dominant feature. Here, customers will be offered hand-crafted cocktails, local beer, as well as a wide-ranging menu.</p>
<p>Brew Brothers is based on a same-named concept that Caesars has implemented at its Eldorado Casino in Reno, NV, and it will have a capacity of 250 people in its indoor tables and the outdoor patio. Additionally, Brew Brothers will feature the so-called fan caves for private parties.</p>
<p>As for the menu, customers will be able to choose between custom burgers, speciality pizzas, ribs, salads, wings, tacos, pasta dishes and desserts. A total of 24 local draft beer selections will be available thanks to the fact that the casino teamed up with four local breweries – Union Craft Brewing, Diamondback Brewing Co. DuClaw Brewing Co. and Checkerspot Brewing Co.</p>
<p>The Restaurant is Set to Open in Q4</p>
<p>At the moment, Brew Brothers is still in development; however, it is expected to open by the end of the year. Caesars Sportsbook is also a work in progress, and when it is finished, it will be located next to the restaurant and the redesigned area for table games. The launch of the sportsbook depends on regulatory approvals. Earlier this month, Maryland started accepting some applications concerning sports betting, which means that fans might be able to place sports wagers this fall.</p>
<p>Randy Conroy, the Senior VP and GM of Horseshoe Baltimore, stated that, without great drinks and food, no sportsbook can be considered complete. He also added that the addition of Brew Brothers will make Horseshoe the best place for guests that want to gain access to their favorite games as betting is approved in the state of Maryland.</p>
<p>The general contractor of the sportsbook and the restaurant is Mahogany Inc., a company based in Maryland. A total of 60 new positions, including cooks, bartenders and waitstaff, is expected to be added to the restaurant. The process of hiring is ongoing and, after 90 days, new hires will receive a $500 bonus.</p>
<p>Other Facilities Are Looking To Expand</p>
<p>Horseshoe Casino is not the only facility that is undergoing changes. Live! Casino in Hanover debuted the Sports &amp; Social lounge in April, worth $15 million and located in the casino’s heart. A built-in retail sportsbook is in the venue and, according to casino officials, as soon as Live! gets the green light, it will be switched on.</p>
<p>The sports betting area in Horseshoe will help the casino boost its revenue, which has been on the downside this year. Before recording gains in July in August, the casino posted year-over-year declines in revenue from January to June. Even though August was a pretty decent month, the numbers were down 1.6% compared to August 2019.</p>
<p>Additionally, Horseshoe is currently working with the Ravens as well as others to create a Warner Street entertainment district. Attractions such as the Paramount concert venue and Topgolf will be included.</p>
