<p>The new partnership designates GeoComply as the exclusive geolocation provider for Underdog for North America</p>
<p>The globally recognized fraud and risk solutions provider, GeoComply, announced it entered into a new agreement Tuesday. The company expanded its portfolio of partners by joining forces with Underdog, the up-and-coming fantasy sports and online sports gaming operator.</p>
<p>Thanks to the freshly minted partnership, the operator gained access to GeoComply’s leading technology and solutions, including GeoComply’s Core suite and Solus product. Per the new deal, Underdog will leverage the solutions to supercharge its fantasy sports operations and boost its future sports betting products.</p>
<p>Known as the most reliable, accurate and robust geolocation technology, GeoComply Core is leveraged by many companies within the gambling vertical. According to the company, some 80% of the users undergo a geolocation check in as little as three seconds.</p>
<p>Moreover, GeoComply explained that the solution “delivers geolocation pass rates of up to 98%, with an IP spoofing detection rate of 99.6%.” The solution also helps combat fraud with tools that protect customers from identity theft, chargeback fraud, bonus abuse and more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the company’s Solus solution brings benefits for fantasy sports operators by removing friction for web-based daily fantasy players. GeoComply reveals that the solution is optimized for HTML5 browsers and ensures that no additional plug-ins are necessary for the geolocation of online players.</p>
<p>The collaboration between GeoComply and Underdog doesn’t come as a surprise. This is because Underdog is famous for being one of the fastest-growing operators within the sector which was last year valuated at $485 million following Series B round fundraising.</p>
<p>The Company Is Delighted to Join Forces with GeoComply</p>
<p>Matt Garrigan, Underdog’s senior director of operations, acknowledged the importance of the collaboration with GeoComply and noted that the company is proud to join forces with the global fraud and risk solutions provider. “This partnership is a key component of ensuring that our customers benefit from a safe, compliant, and frictionless experience,” he explained.</p>
<p>“We are proud to work with partners like GeoComply to meet our commitments to our customers and regulators.“ Matt Garrigan, senior director of operations at Underdog</p>
<p>Sam Basile, GeoComply’s VP of business development and licensing, was similarly delighted about the collaboration with the fast-growing fantasy sports and online sports gaming operator. He said that the partnership with the company brings thrill to GeoComply. Finally, Basile acknowledged that Underdog’s commitment to innovative products and focus on customers helped the company continue to grow within the highly-competitive market.</p>
