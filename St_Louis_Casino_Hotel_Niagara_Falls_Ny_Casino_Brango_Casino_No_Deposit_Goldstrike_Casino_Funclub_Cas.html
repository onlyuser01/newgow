<p>Global provider of top-tier entertainment and gaming solutions across all channels International Game Technology (IGT) has announced a five-year expansion of its contract with Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries Corporation (MBLL). IGT’s subsidiary, IGT Canada Solutions ULC, will be delivering the improved and updated version of IGT’s INTELLIGEN central system that focuses on video lottery.</p>
<p>What Will IGT’s Upgraded INTELLIGEN System Bring to MBLL’s Table</p>
<p>IGT is one of the irrefutable global leaders in the gaming market, constantly working on creating the most entertaining and compelling experiences for players interested in sports betting, lotteries, gaming, and digital services. The provider that does not skimp on making important investments targeting innovation serves all regulated markets.</p>
<p>This way, IGT generates unparalleled experiences that focus on deep player insights and top-tier technologies while focusing on economic, social, and environmental responsibility. This January, IGT embraced climate change through a new Science Based Targets partnership.</p>
<p>Its INTELLIGEN system is one of the most successful products retailers use in all parts of the planet. For the next five years, MBLL’s video lottery central system will benefit from the upgraded version, which now includes enhanced network diagnostics solutions. MBLL will also receive a number of iLINK Ultras, which are a series of top controllers with different point-of-sale devices and logic boxes. The controllers offer better flexibility along with an upgraded user interface that will help MBLL enjoy more helpful features.</p>
<p>IGT’s INTELLIGEN system is the result of more than two and a half decades of experience in creating central systems and manages to intertwine different video lottery terminals in several gaming environments. INTELLIGEN will offer safe and reliable control and command options while bringing together close to 6,600 video lottery terminals spread all across Manitoba.</p>
<p>This will help MBLL constantly stay up-to-date with the efficiency of its network of video lottery terminals. As part of the same contract expansion, the Canadian IGT subsidiary will also provide MBLL with PlayCasino games, casino cabinets, and IGT ADVANTAGE, which is a casino management system that will further help MBLL operate its machines with more confidence.</p>
<p>MBLL Is Busy Improving the Lives of Manitobans</p>
<p>Manitoba Liquor &amp; Lotteries is a Crown corporation based in the Canadian Manitoba province that sells and distributes liquor, sources, and distributes non-medical cannabis to retailers in Manitoba, and offers numerous gaming and entertainment experiences to locals.</p>
<p>All MBLL profits are used to support and promote education, health care, community, and social services in the area, while 2% of the anticipated yearly net income goes to responsible gambling, along with responsible cannabis and liquor consumption, and a series of treatment and research programs.</p>
<p>MBLL currently operates McPhillips Station Casino, Club Regent Casino, and PlayNow.com. Their network of video lottery terminals is controlled by their Morris-based office and actively supports Manitoba’s hotel and restaurant industry. MBLL also sells and distributes Western Canada Lottery Corporation products via its own network of retailers.</p>
<p>The new contract expansion from IGT will help the corporation gain better control over all of its operations and improve its overall performance.</p>
