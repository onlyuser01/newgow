<p>Relax Gaming Is Excited to Deliver a New Game</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is an already established B2B supplier within the online gambling vertical. Only recently, the company was recognized at the EGR B2B Awards as the Best Mobile Gaming Software Provider. Moreover, Relax Gaming secured a Casino / Slot Developer of the Year award from the SBC Awards. The company was also recognized by the AskGamblers Awards in 2022 as the Best Game Provider.</p>
<p>Overall, Relax Gaming offers more than 4,000 online casino games. Its high-performing library of games stands out with engaging titles as well as hand-picked third-party games delivered via deals with different developers.</p>
<p>“We are excited to bring this rendition of Money Train 3 to players residing in areas with Buy Feature restrictions.“ Shelley Hannah, director of casino products at Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Shelley Hannah, Relax Gaming’s director of casino products, said that the company is delighted to deliver the new game that targets markets with buy feature restrictions. She predicted that the game will be well-received by the players and acknowledged it delivers engaging features and unique experiences. Finally, Hannah said: “Historically, these games have performed exceptionally well, and we expect Money Cart 3 to be no different.”</p>
<p>The Game Boosts the Experience with Re-Spins, Special Symbols</p>
<p>The new title from Relax Gaming targets markets with buy feature restrictions, delivering different options for re-spins. To trigger the game’s re-spin feature, online players need to land three or more symbols anywhere on the reel. Besides re-spins symbols, gold symbols can also help trigger the re-spin feature, explained the game developer.</p>
<p>Additionally, Relax Gaming said that once the feature is triggered “gold symbols will reveal a value and play their action before the first spin.” During that mode, online players will see coin values and if the sum hits 100,000 or higher, this is when the re-spin round will end and the player secures 100,000 coins.</p>
<p>Besides the re-spin feature and the potential to secure a 10,000x prize, Money Cart 3 offers other engaging modes. Overall, the game has 13 different special symbols and different combinations of those symbols can trigger rewarding payouts for the players.</p>
