    <h1>Santa Claran Hotel And Casino Espanola New Mexico Legends Casino Buffet Mohegan Sun Casino Ilani Cas</h1>

<p>I won on a no rules coupon that had no maximum cashout. But when i tried to withdraw it had a 2000 maximum cashout on Coindraw for the month.</p>
<p>The rest i put in for bitcoin then after a week and still nothing they took my winnings because i played roulette with the funds i won. How are they able to keep my winnings that were from a jackpot? This is so unfair they dont follow the no max coupon but enforce rules to a coupon that was done and a withdrawal was completed from? I thought that i was able to play after the withdraw was completed? They broke the contract first by putting a maximum withdrawal limit on a no max coupon didn't they? Please help that is alot of money for them to steal from me.....please...i beg you to help....</p>
<p>Ps they used three or four different reasons why first they said i was playing from free daily spins then it was mixing funds then they said that i played non-allowed games ? How is it they just keep coming up with violations untill they have one they rhink sticks?</p>
<p>Also im not in Utah it wont let.me change it im in California</p>
