<p>Elys Game Technology, one of the fastest growing and technologically advanced sports betting and iGaming full-service platform providers, is hoping to soon begin operating in the state of New Jersey.</p>
<p>Elys Awaits Approval to Launch in the Garden State</p>
<p>The company announced that it has submitted its US Gameboard sports betting platform for approval by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. The company has applied for a transactional waiver, hoping to speed up its approval process and foray into the Garden State’s betting market.</p>
<p>The whole process is run by Elys’ subsidiary in the United States, US Bookmaking. To ensure its best chances of success, Elys has partnered with the Ocean Casino Resort – a gambling venue located in the center of Atlantic City.</p>
<p>This is an Important Step for Elys’ Future</p>
<p>Mike Ciavarella, the executive chairman of Elys, spoke on the application. He promised that the operator is continuing to work hard alongside Ocean Casino Resort towards a successful launch. Ciavarella pointed out that this won’t be possible without first receiving the approval of New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement, which is why the current application is an important moment in the company’s history.</p>
<p>Ciavarella described the forthcoming New Jersey launch as the culmination of all of the company’s experience and efforts:</p>
<p>“Our anticipated entry into New Jersey builds on our multi-pronged revenue strategy of expansion into the traditional casino business, development of the small business sportsbook market, and growth of the mobile iGaming market.”</p>
<p>About the Company</p>
<p>Elys is a Toronto-based company that mainly focuses on business-to-business offerings and provides various solutions to the sports betting and iGaming market. The company changed its name to Elys Game Technology in 2020 and was previously known as Newgioco Group.</p>
<p>As of now, Elys has been approved to run its operations in five markets across the United States. In September, Elys Game Tech was approved for a provisional Class B Standard Management Service Provider License in Washington DC. Thanks to that, Elys was allowed to introduce its US Gameboard platform in the Grand Central Restaurant and Bar venue.</p>
<p>The company also operates B2C operations in Italy through land-based venues. Speaking of Italy, the company recently expanded its presence in the European country by signing a key partnership with the gaming software company Playtech. In December, Elys and Playtech agreed to work together in a deal that will see Elys’ Italian subsidiary, Newgioco, add Playtech content to its offerings.</p>
