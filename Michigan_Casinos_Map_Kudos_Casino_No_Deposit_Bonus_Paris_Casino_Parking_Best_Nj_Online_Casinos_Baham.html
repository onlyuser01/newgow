<p>Thanks to NuxGame's newest Multi-Balance feature, online players can easily switch between funds from different currencies if they run out. Additionally, the feature enables them to load more funds in a currency they prefer and then convert them while using the platform.</p>
<p>The functionality, according to the leading betting and gaming software provider, helps boost the retention rate and loyalty of gambling operators. What's more, NuxGame explained that the latest addition to its system follows "the recent Loyalty Program integration into its offering, which rewards players for engaging on operator's platform boosting retention rates for clients."</p>

Besides providing innovative software solutions for iGaming and betting operators, the company's portfolio includes a scalable website API that features a sportsbook offering.
