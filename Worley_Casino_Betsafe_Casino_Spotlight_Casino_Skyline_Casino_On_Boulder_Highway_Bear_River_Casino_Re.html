    <h1>Worley Casino Betsafe Casino Spotlight Casino Skyline Casino On Boulder Highway Bear River Casino Re</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group has selected a new industry veteran to be the company’s Senior Vice President of Business Development for Platform and Sportsbook. Ryan Collinge is a practised industry insider whose 20 years of experience have seen him hold multiple positions across the industry.</p>
<p>He notably worked with Inspired Gaming Group for nine years before leaving the company in 2012 and joining Playnation Ltd. as Executive Sales Director. Collinge later worked with Blueprint Gaming as Group Director prior to his decision to switch teams and join Gaming Innovation Group instead.</p>
<p>His appointment comes at an important time for Gaming Innovation Group as well, as Collinge will be looking to strengthen the Platform and Sportsbook business, and boost its commercial footprint, steering the X-Suite portfolio towards success. Gaming Innovation Group is confident that Collinge has an important part to play in boosting the company’s commercial initiatives, and CBO Andrew Cochrane has voted the man his full confidence.</p>
<p>Cochrane has hailed Collinge’s arrival to the team, arguing that the newly hand-picked expert would help with business development efforts. "His experience and proven track record at driving commercial successes is undeniably impressive," Cochrane explained.</p>
<p>The firm already provides outstanding products and services, and it is now strengthening its team that can bring this unique offer to market and derive benefits for partner businesses. There have been a number of important products and initiatives released over the past months, including the launch of the X-Suite Platform CoreX and Sportsbook SportX, along with DataX and LogicX, two features boosted by AI solutions.</p>
<p>Collinge himself was very welcoming of the opportunity and thanked for the chance to become part of the business. He noted that the new X-Suite of products was indeed impressive, and he was looking forward to making sure that he helped grow their footprint among existing and potential partners.</p>
<p>Not least, the appointment was hailed by GiG Platform and Sportsbook CEO Richard Carter who was similarly happy to see the team grow and be strengthened by a relevant individual with a honed skill set.</p>
<p>"His arrival will further help propel GiG forward to significantly scale revenue and acquire accomplished new partners," Carter noted, highlighting Collinge’s proven track record as part of the industry over the past two decades.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, GiG helped pave the way in for Betway in Portugal in Europe, as the company continues to be a trusted platform provider for popular and licensed brands.</p>
