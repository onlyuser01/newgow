<p>Temple of Nudges review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Temple of Nudges is a cartoonish Mayan-based slot, with a particular focus on the wild animals that haunt the Amazon basin. Rendered in a style that seems half Aztec hieroglyph and half origami.</p>
<p>The title refers to its nudge based bonus system which is detailed below. The nudge system works well thematically with the game’s choice to make its reels part of the edifice of an ancient, jungle-bound temple.</p>
<p>Big win is guaranteed if you fill entire grid with a single high symbol</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics on this game are slick and well-drawn, with the imagery seeming to be fully detailed but not busy or difficult to read.</p>
<p>The animations are smooth and combined perfectly with the sound design to give the game a real feeling of weight. The bricks crumbling and dropping during the nudges, for example, are especially satisfying.</p>
<p>High symbol combined with nudges and respins will boost your bankroll significantly</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>NetEnt's Temple of Nudges is built on five reels with three rows each and an any way wins system, where a symbol will pay out if it appears anywhere on three or more consecutive reels starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>This basic system for the game is made a little more exciting by the nudge feature detailed below, but is largely a very simple game. This will put some people off, but if you don’t like your games too complicated this might well work nicely for you.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol in Temple of Nudges, nor are there any Bonuses per se. However, there are a few little features that get you extra free spins and act as mini-bonuses.</p>
<p>The first of these is the Nudge feature. This occurs whenever the player hits a winning combination on the reels. Once the win has been logged, the bottom row drops off the bottom and a new top row drops down. This continues until no new wins are possible.</p>
<p>The Respin feature is triggered at random during winning rounds when a Respin overlay falls on the reels. This locks all the winning symbols in place and respins the rest allowing you another shot at a win.</p>
<p>One of the bonuses - the Respin feature</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.03%, which is roughly average for the industry.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested went from $/£/€0.25 per spin up to $/£/€250.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which is not quite high enough to fit well with our preferred strategies, all of which require higher volatility wherever possible.</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable for Temple of Nudges slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Although pretty to look at, fun to play, and intelligently designed, Temple of Nudges doesn’t quite win a strong recommendation from us.</p>
<p>This is mostly due to its medium volatility which is lower than we would normally like. Against this, the average return to player and quality gameplay don’t quite make up for this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the heart recommends but the maths says, "No."</p>
