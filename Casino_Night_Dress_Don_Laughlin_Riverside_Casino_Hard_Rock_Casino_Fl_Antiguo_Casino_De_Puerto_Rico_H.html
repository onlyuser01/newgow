<p>Good day,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out.</p>
<p>Please note that during the Security Department check the client’s account was recognized as a duplicate. We would like to refer to the following point of the Terms and Conditions of our website that the customer agreed to when creating an account:</p>
<p>3.2 Your account with the Website must be registered in your own, correct, name. Only one account per person, per household/address, per phone number/email, and per IP address is allowed. Any other accounts that are opened on the Website will be considered as "Duplicate Accounts". You must not attempt to open a Duplicate Account, including by providing false or alternative credentials. If you open or attempt to open any number of Duplicate Accounts, we reserve the right to close some or all of your accounts without any compensation and apply the following sanctions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>each action performed using a Duplicate Account is considered void;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any promotions that the Duplicate Account has participated in will be cancelled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any winnings obtained on the Duplicate Account will be void. Any processed withdrawals will be reversed and will be owed back to the Company;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Duplicate Account will be closed without an option to reopen it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two accounts in question are connected by the personal details and IP addresses. In addition to this, both accounts took advantage of the same bonus offers. Based on the above we were forced to close the account and void the winnings. The client’s last deposit has been already refunded. We hope the above clarifies our position.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact us should you have any questions.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Boomerang Casino</p>
