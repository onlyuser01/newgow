    <h1>Eureka Casino Resort Rivers Casino Resort Schenectady Bitcoin Live Casino Crypto Casino Usa Pala Res</h1>

<p>I deposited using XRP. Had a small win and went to cash out and a Red box popped up saying is invalid.</p>
<p>Contacted live chat and they told me to do a bank withdrawal instead so I did.</p>
<p>A day and a half later they cancel it saying I have to withdrawal via the same method I deposited. So I try again and again and the same red box appears saying is invalid, which means I cannot withdraw my money. Contacted support again and keep getting the run around with the same answers saying change browser clear history etc which I did every time, and now they are ignoring me.</p>
<p>I even sent them my XRP wallet address to see if they can manually do it and they are still ignoring me, not giving any other options.</p>
<p>From what I have seen, there is other people having this issue also which is not fair gaming from a supposedly licenced casino.</p>
<p>They are defanitely blocking any attempt I make to withdrawal my money and telling contradicting stories</p>
