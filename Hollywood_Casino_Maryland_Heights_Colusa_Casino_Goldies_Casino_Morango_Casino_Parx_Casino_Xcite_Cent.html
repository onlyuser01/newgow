    <h1>Hollywood Casino Maryland Heights Colusa Casino Goldies Casino Morango Casino Parx Casino Xcite Cent</h1>

<p>Greetings everyone,</p>
<p>The details of the complaint are as follows:</p>
<p>On 03.01.2024 (15 days ago), the customer brought to our attention that two deposits are currently absent from their bank account, and these funds have yet to be credited to their RoySpins balance.</p>
<p>Immediately we initiated an investigation from our end and requested a check from our payment system provider, an outsourced third-party service, to assess the status of the customer's payments.</p>
<p>They notified us that the transactions were declined, the funds did not reach them, and to conduct a more thorough investigation, additional documentation was required.</p>
<p>On the next day, we sent the customer the following email:</p>
<p>"We have launched an in-depth investigation of your issue. We will contact you as soon as we have any news.</p>
<p>If you would like to speed up the process, please provide the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bank statement for all your transactions from 12/22/2023 to date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your account number (IBAN)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your first and last name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the recipient to whom the funds were sent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your patience."</p>
<p>On that very day, the customer didn't send the requested documents but sent us screenshots of payment confirmations that have undergone evident graphic manipulation. If necessary, we can forward these screenshots to the CasinoGuru team for their own assessment, although we are highly confident that this is indeed the case.</p>
<p>After document analysis, the following email was sent to the customer:</p>
<p>"After conducting a detailed analysis, we have identified noticeable evidence of manipulation in the document that you have submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of these findings, we believe it is essential to take additional measures to address this issue thoroughly, therefore to assist you in locating your funds, we kindly request that you provide us with valid documents containing the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bank statement for all your transactions from 12/22/2023 to date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your account number (IBAN)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your first and last name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the recipient to whom the funds were sent."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After this, the normality of communication ended. The customer accused us of being scammers, alleging theft of funds, issuing threats of legal action, and adamantly refusing to provide the requested documents without graphic alterations.</p>
<p>Bruno, please forward the requested documents to us without any edits. This will enable us to promptly resend them to our payment provider, allowing them to proceed with the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>Hope this clarification helps!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>RoySpins Team</p>
