<p>Posted on: June 27, 2021, 06:58h.</p>

<p>An unnamed man was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries after a Sunday shooting at the Sahara Las Vegas. A suspect has yet to be named or arrested, local news organizations reported.</p>

<p>The victim was shot in the torso around 11:33 am. The shooting took place in room 2221 at the hotel, according to KVVU, a local TV station.</p>
<p>The wounded man was transported to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, police said. The TV station also reported the man was in critical condition as of Sunday afternoon. It was unclear if he required surgery.</p>
<p>Metro Police were searching later on Sunday for evidence at the crime scene and looking for possible witnesses. The hotel-casino is located at 2535 Las Vegas Blvd. South.</p>
<p>Anyone with information on the incident can call Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555.</p>
<p>Fatal Shooting At Off-Strip Bar</p>
<p>Also, in an apparently unrelated incident, a man was killed at a bar off of the Las Vegas Strip on Sunday.</p>
<p>Later on Sunday, police continued to investigate the early-morning fatal shooting inside PT’s Place at Decatur Boulevard near Charleston Boulevard, according to local media.</p>
<p>That bar is west of the Strip. The shooting took place at about 3 am on Sunday.</p>
<p>Initial police reports indicate a man walked up to another man and shot him, according to KLAS, a local TV station. The assailant then left the bar.</p>
<p>Before the shooting, there appeared to be no interaction between the duo, police added and KLAS reported. No immediate word from police on the identity of the possible suspect. Nor were there details on the wounds.</p>
<p>The victim was believed to be a Hispanic man in his late 20s. An autopsy is likely to be performed soon and police are reviewing surveillance camera video from PT’s Place, KLAS said.</p>
<p>Violent Crime Had Decreased on Strip</p>
<p>News about the weekend shootings comes shortly after Metro police announced that violent crime on the Strip declined by double digits in the last month.</p>
<p>In a tweet posted on June 25, Metro Capt. Dori Koren reported crime on the Strip dropped by 11 percent over the past month. He added that there have been no shootings or stabbings on the Strip in two months.</p>
<p>But that was before Sunday’s Sahara shooting, as well as the shooting at the bar.</p>
<p>In response to recent increases in crime along the Strip, Metro police have put into place “Operation Persistent Pressure II.”</p>
<p>As part of the selective enforcement, Metro police confiscated weapons and illegal drugs on or near the Strip. A gold-plated AK-47 rifle and numerous handguns were among the firearms confiscated in recent months.</p>
<p>That initiative follows a 2020 enforcement effort called “Operation Persistent Pressure.”</p>
<p>“Operation Persistent Pressure” took place on Friday and Saturday nights from Sept. 18 to Dec. 20. In total, 1,229 suspects were charged by Metro police under the initiative. The Nevada Highway Patrol assisted in the effort.</p>
