<p>Las Vegas oddsmakers opened the line with Green Bay spotting Philly 4.5 points. The early action was on the underdogs, slightly shortening the points spread. The over/under is at 46 points.</p>
<p>As for the outright moneyline, FanDuel has the Packers at -205, and Eagles +178. A $100 wager on the Cheeseheads nets $48.78, while the same bet on the Birds would net $178.</p>
<p>The Eagles are coming off a disappointing 27-24 at-home loss to the Detroit Lions. The Pack is off to a perfect 3-0 start, but superstar QB Aaron Rodgers is far from pleased.</p>
<p>“It’s time for us to do our part on offense,” Rodgers said Tuesday. “At some point, we can’t expect our defense to shut everybody down. They have been, but at some point the offense is going to have to wake up and start making some plays.”</p>
<p>Rodgers has 647 passing yards through three games, the second-lowest total through three games in his potential Hall of Fame, 14-year career.</p>
<p>The Packers are 8-2 against the spread in their last 10 games when favored by 4.5 points or less. The Eagles are 0-6 ATS in their last six games.</p>
<p>Rushing Back to Gridiron</p>
<p>Thursday Night Football is exciting for fans, but not always the players. A short week minimizes the time available to prepare for the next opponent.</p>
<p>For the Eagles, however, the team is excited to move on from back-to-back losses.</p>
<p>The faster we are able to move on to something else, we don’t have time to sit here and wallow in our sorrows and feel bad for ourselves or make excuses,” safety Malcolm Jenkins said. “We have a game in a couple of days. On to the next.”</p>
<p>Philly QB Carson Wentz – who has taken some criticism for the slow start – added, “Obviously, there is a high urgency. We’re coming off two losses, first and foremost. But now we have a game on Thursday. No one feels bad for us and we don’t feel bad for ourselves.”</p>
<p>The Eagles began the season at 12/1 to win the Super Bowl. They’re now at 25/1. That implies a diminished chance from 7.69 percent to 3.85 percent.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Philly expects to have star receiver Alshon Jeffery and tight end Dallas Goedert back for the critical Green Bay matchup.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Latest</p>
<p>Following their 3-0 start, despite Rodgers’ offense playing subpar by their terms, Green Bay’s Super Bowl odds have shortened from 14/1 preseason to 10/1. A Packers Vince Lombardi Trophy wouldn’t be ideal for oddsmakers, as the team always attracts substantial futures handle.</p>
<p>The New England Patriots seem to be in a league of their own. The odds of Tom Brady and company defending their title and claiming the franchise’s seventh Super Bowl stand at 7/2 (+350). The Kansas City Chiefs trail closely at 4/1, and then it’s the Los Angeles Rams and Dallas Cowboys (8/1), and Packers rounding out the top five.</p>
