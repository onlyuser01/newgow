<p>Booming Games has continued with its growth strategy in regulated markets with Spain becoming the latest jurisdiction where the company is keen to expand.</p>
<p>Players in the local market will now have the opportunity to access the supplier’s extensive portfolio of games, which includes Megahops Megaways, Buffalo Hold and Win, TheWildWings of Phoenix, Crack the Bank Hold and Win, and many other games through TonyBet.</p>
<p>TonyBet has become the gateway for Booming Games in one of the most important and regulated markets in Europe. This partnership willallow players the opportunity to significantly increase the level of fun and gaming options they get by accessing the local operator.</p>
<p>There will be more titles introduced to TonyBet’s game lobby with Booming Games’ help in the near future, too, the companies detailed in an official press release.</p>
<p>The supplier has doubled down on the significance of the partnership, arguing that it will allow it to significantly expand its presence in regulated iGaming markets in Europe with Spain being one of the major focuses of expansion. Booming Games Chief Commercial Officer Frederik Niehusen was very happy to see this partnership with TonyBet take shape.</p>
<p>He called the operator a company that is at the forefront of the gambling industry and the entry into Spain a "momentous achievement."</p>
<p>"TonyBet sets itself apart by providing the safest, fairest, and most trusted online betting environment for players worldwide. This partnership will greatly strengthen our presence in the Spanish market," Niehusen said.</p>
<p>TonyBet Key Account Manager Davis Skulte was similarly thrilled to welcome Booming Games as one of the suppliers at the operator. He spoke highly of the products that the company brings to the fore and highlighted their importance and significance for the operator’s local presence and further expansion efforts in Spain.</p>
<p>All in all, Skulte said that TonyBet had been eagerly looking forward to this partnership and the benefits thereof. Booming Games has also been scaling its presence in global markets, besides Europe. Recently, the company entered the Colombian iGaming industry with Rivalo, a prominent local operator in the country.</p>
<p>The supplier is also featured on Kindred Group’s brands, such as Bingo dot com, Maria Casino, and Unibet, offering innovative experiences for players. Reevo, a fast-expanding content aggregator, recently added both Booming Games and Pariplay to its portfolio of partners.</p>
