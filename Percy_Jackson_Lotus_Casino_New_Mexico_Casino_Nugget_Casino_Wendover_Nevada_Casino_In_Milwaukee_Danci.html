    <h1>Percy Jackson Lotus Casino New Mexico Casino Nugget Casino Wendover Nevada Casino In Milwaukee Danci</h1>

<p>There have been so many instances of them giving me the runaround between paradise 8 and their sister site since october 2022, that its honestly impossible to keep track of. so the above number is the minimum amount in payouts i am still waiting on from october and november. They have communicated via email but there emails are vague, they don't put amounts in them, and they dont respond to direct questions.</p>
<p>i had a win of $836.49 on 10/31, they said with their rules their max cashout for me would be $300.49, which they said that they sent via wire on 12/20. In which they did not. I asked them about it and they said they would look into it and never got back to me. The deposit was $33 so if the max cashout was 10x the payout should have been $330, but i didnt receive any of anything from that win. And they just left it saying completed in there.</p>
<p>i also had another win of $136.18 that they converted to $100 in which i have not been paid out on.</p>
<p>There was also another payment of $100 that i have not been paid out on.</p>
<p>There is also a payout of $13`1.38 that i requested on 11/12 that i have not been paid out on.</p>
<p>in addition to these, i received multiple denials, not stating where it was from or the and basically every excuse of why not to pay out. This is why i asked for them to send a detailed account of all. Because they're handling of all is atrocious, and impossible to follow. The above 4 is the last of them, which i have stayed on top of with no luck in receiving any of it. This has been a horrible experience with both of their casinos.</p>
