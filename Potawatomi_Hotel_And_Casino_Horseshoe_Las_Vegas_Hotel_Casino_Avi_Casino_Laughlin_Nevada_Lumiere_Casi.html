<p>Pragmatic Play, a company known for its slot, live casino, and virtual sports product, has made a groundbreaking move in Spain and the sports betting vertical by introducing its Sportsbook product as part of an inaugural deal with DAZN BET, the fast-developing streaming-platform-turned-betting-operator.</p>
<p>This partnership will see Pragmatic Play power DAZN BET’s operations in the country in what is a rare vote of confidence by a company to a new product. DAZN BET has most likely considered Pragmatic Play’s impeccable reputation in offering full-service iGaming solutions and felt strongly about the supplier’s chances to help differentiate the DAZN BET brand right from the get-go.</p>
<p>Besides, through this tie-up, DAZN BET has direct access to Pragmatic Play’s other excellent products, including slots, live casino, and virtual sports. The integration of the Sportsbook solution has been facilitated through the company’s dedicated Player Account Management (PAM) Platform technology, which has already been used by DAZN BET.</p>
<p>DAZN BET is confident that the introduction of Pragmatic Play’s platform will open new avenues for growth. The company is already confident about the future and poised to make significant gains in the coming months, building upon its most successful operational months so far.</p>
<p>DAZN BET CMO Simon Gatenby has welcomed Pragmatic Play as the company’s partner, arguing that Pragmatic Play has a solid reputation for technologically sound solutions.</p>
<p>"Working in tandem with Pragmatic Solutions, we’re confident that our customers in Spain will love the new platform, and that we’ll give them an unforgettable sports betting experience," Gatenby said.</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Pragmatic Play VP of Sports Gareth Crook who said that the collaboration with DAZN BET was definitely an exciting time for the company and a great way to make an entry into the sports betting vertical.</p>
<p>It has been a long process, Crook explained, but one that was well worth the effort. "We are proud to be associated with this flagship brand and have no doubt that DAZN BET will establish itself as a leading operator in the country, powered by Pragmatic Play’s Sportsbook," he concluded.</p>
<p>DAZN BET has been expanding across Europe at a good pace, too, with the company focusing on similar entries in Germany and Italy over the last few months.</p>
