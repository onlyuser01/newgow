<p>Spinomenal has confirmed that it is expanding its presence in the regulated iGaming market in Bulgaria through a new content tie-up with efbet, one of the leading local online casino brands. Spinomenal has been happy to deliver content since it received the necessary permits from the country’s gambling regulator, the National Revenue Agency, which took over the sector several years back amid a large corruption probe.</p>
<p>Now, Spinomenal’s titles will also be available at efbet, courtesy of Fusion, an aggregation solution housed and managed by Pariplay. Efbet players will gain access to a range of outstanding titles delivered by the supplier, among which are such noteworthy releases such as Book of Rampage, Demi Gods II, Majestic King, and frankly, many others.</p>
<p>Spinomenal CEO Lior Shvartz was excited to discuss this opportunity and said the supplier was confident in its long-term success in the Bulgarian iGaming market. There has been a significant demand for quality products in the fast-evolving market in the country.</p>
<p>"This collaboration marks a significant milestone in bringing top-tier slot entertainment to more audiences across Bulgaria," Shvartz added. The news was naturally welcomed by efbet, which spoke highly of the opportunity to incorporate Spinomenal casino games as part of its platform.</p>
<p>The company described this as a strategic decision that aligned well with its core strategy and boded well for the long-term success of the operator in the highly competitive market. "We believe that this partnership will contribute to both brands increasing their popularity and solidifying their status as key players," efbet said.</p>
<p>The news comes at a time of another momentous change in the Bulgarian gambling market, with the finance minister, Assen Vasilev, now pushing for a much tougher regime on the gambling industry and asking for a 300% increase in renewable licensing fees, and effectively what has been described as a 60% hike in the alternative tax.</p>
<p>The measure was pitched during a budget hearing that ratified the country’s next year's budget and caused a stir among industry representatives. Industry groups have already objected to the suddenness of the measure, lack of public and business consideration, and consultancy, and reminded that gambling is a business that contributes roughly $195m in taxes annually and employs 80,000 people.</p>
<p>As to Spinomenal, though, the supplier is confident and willing to continue with its expansion in the country. Previously, the supplier partnered up with another prominent sector operator, WINBET.</p>
