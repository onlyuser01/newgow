<p>Greentube, an innovative supplier and developer of online casino content, has achieved another market expansion with Betsson Group’s Inkabet. The partnership focuses on the Peruvian market and will allow the Novomatic Digital Gaming and Entertainment division to break ground into a new high-value market in Latin America.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, Greentube’s games will be introduced to Inkabet audiences in the country and have the chance to bolster the supplier’s regional profile. Among the titles that will be delivered locally are options such as Book of Ra Deluxe, Sizzling Hot Deluxe, Diamond Link, Mighty Buffalo, Lucky Lady’s Charm Deluxe, and a range of other worthwhile titles.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Betsson Group Head of Supplier Relations LauraPeretta welcomed the opportunity to see Greentube join the company’s content portfolio. She called the games delivered by the supplier high-quality and said that the brand was proud to be forming the alliance.</p>
<p>"We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible gaming experience, and we believe that this partnership will help us to achieve that goal," Peretta wrapped up.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by Greentube Regional Manager JelenaPopovic as well, who was equally happy to see Greentube expand with one of the biggest Peruvian brands in iGaming, Inkabet. Popovic said that Greentube’s content was already well-established with audiences in South America, and that this new alliance will only strengthen the supplier’s presence locally.</p>
<p>Greentube has not wasted time pursuing growth in LatinAmerica and it is already established in several jurisdictions and countries regionally, including Chile and Ecuador, as well as Buenos Aires City in Argentina, which operates as an independent iGaming jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Greentube has not only been focusing on the North American market. In fact, the company has been expanding rapidly across other jurisdictions as well. The supplier recently strengthened its German presence with Jokerstar.</p>
<p>Similarly, Greentube moved in on the Dutch iGaming market, strengthening its local presence there with the help of bet365, another respected and trusted operator. A big part of Greentube’s expansion strategy has been its position in North America, and specifically the United States.</p>
<p>Greentube is already present in several iGaming states, including Pennsylvania, where the company obtained a license to supply its products. Meanwhile, the supplier is already operational in both Michigan and Ontario, Canada.</p>
