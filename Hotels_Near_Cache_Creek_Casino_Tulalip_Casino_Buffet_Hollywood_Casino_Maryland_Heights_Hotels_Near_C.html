    <h1>Hotels Near Cache Creek Casino Tulalip Casino Buffet Hollywood Casino Maryland Heights Hotels Near C</h1>

<p>I want to include spreadsheets I made of the deposits I submitted to Red Dog Casino. I got the information straight from my account history, so they can compare everything to their own records, as it will match, due to the fact I obtained this information from their records. The purpose to include my deposit transactions is because their blanket excuse for subjecting me to such a low payout amount is;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Credit scores. (They have no way of knowing my credit score. My ssn was never given to them.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deposit type and frequency. (This is why I'm submitting this additional information. As you will see this is also not a valid excuse.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers reputation with Red Dog Casino as well as others. (I've NEVER gotten into any type of altercation or caused any trouble. I have also spent time/money at other casinos they are associated with. I can only hope they ask for deposit transactions from them so that it can become even more obvious how INvalid this excuse is as well. If my "reputation" isn't stellar, I would definitely want to know why! With proof.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duration and outcome of gaming sessions. (What does that even mean? Of course I'd want them all to last as long as possible and I'd want to win! So, I'm also disappointed with the Duration and outcome of gaming sessions, maybe they are rigged??? Regardless, what does that have to do with limiting my payouts to a low $300???)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wager frequency. (Again...what does this mean in regards to payouts? How often I'm bidding? Well...till the money runs out or I lose! Isn't that the point? Regardless, another INvalid excuse.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopted payout methods. (Well, wait a second here....don't THEY determine which payout method they're gonna use? Because I KNOW that it CLEARLY states that they may not utilize the method requested, so, the payout method is on THEM, not ME! If 5hey don't want to payout via bitcoin, that's fine with me! Again, ANOTHER INvalid excuse to limit payouts!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frequency of reversing payouts. (I actually have submitted for a payout before and then canceled it and gave it back to them. So, are they seriously gonna hold that against me? That instead of them paying me for winning, I stupidly gambled it right back to them so they got to keep it and didn't have to pay me out anything. If this is actually a reason to limit payout amounts, it's a really horribly bad business practice. That customers can be reprimanded for spending their potential winnings with them instead of cashing out. Usually the purpose of a business is to make money. Regardless, this is a ridiculous excuse! Just WHY would reversing a payout cause them to admonish customers? Perhaps they actually mean reversing payMENTS, instead of payOUTS? Because that would make alot of sense, but reversing payOUTS makes zero sense!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Membership duration. (Well, I've been a DEPOSITING member with THIS casino since April 2022. But I've been a member with some of the other casinos they are associated with before I joined Red Dog.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I just wanted you to have easily on hand all the rebuttals to their excuses. I do not believe that ANY of those reasons apply or justify limiting my payouts to a mere $300. Even the other sites they're associated with have HIGHER limits! The smallest limit (before Red Dog) was Aussie Play Casino and their limit was $400! But I feel there is NO justifiable reason to not allow me to withdraw the $2500 per request that THEY state is their limit. Looking at other reviews, it seems quite obvious that they have NEVER WILLINGLY allowed ANYONE to EVER withdraw their max limit of $2500. I would actually ask them to just name ONE person that they've paid out $2500 per ONE legitimate request! I feel they must have a reason (probably a legal reason, perhaps pertaining to licensing) for why they have to state a max payout amount of $2500 although they've never had any intention of ever following through with that amount per single request.</p>
