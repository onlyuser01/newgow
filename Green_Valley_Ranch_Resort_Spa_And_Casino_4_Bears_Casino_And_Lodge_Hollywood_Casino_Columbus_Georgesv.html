<p>The deal is the latest in a string of agreements that has seen NuxGame join forces with companies such as Ainsworth Game Technology, Turbo Games, Elbet and Pascal Games</p>
<p>NuxGame, a leading provider of betting and gaming software, has onboarded RubyPlay games to its aggregation portfolio. Having secured slots content from the latter company, NuxGame will further solidify itself as one of the best gaming suppliers.</p>
<p>As per the deal, RubyPlay will power NuxGame with some of its best slot games. The iGaming development studio will thus enhance the latter company’s platform with hit slots, including Diamond Explosion 7s, Mayan Cache and Zeus Rush Fever Deluxe.</p>
<p>RubyPlay’s name is already known by many players. The studio’s games are currently available in multiple regulated markets, allowing countless players to experience premium gaming moments. The studio boasts a catalogue of more than 80 interactive and immersive slots.</p>
<p>At the same time, the studio, which has offices in Australia, Malta and Ukraine, also offers a range of game development services to the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Thanks to NuxGame’s international reach, RubyPlay’s content will be able to reach more casino operators and, by extension, more players. The deal follows the studio’s foray into Romania, which further expanded its global footprint.</p>
<p>Teaming with NuxGame Will Expand RubyPlay’s Reach</p>
<p>NuxGame’s head of sales and business development, Bar Konson, released a statement on the new deal, saying that the partnership with RubyPlay is a “wonderful achievement” for his company. The content deal, Konson noted, will allow NuxGame’s clients to access the latest games released by the slot studio.</p>
<p>Relationships such as these allow us to expand our services and growth trajectory whilst being mutually beneficial to both the providers we partner with and our clients. Bar Konson, head of sales and business development, NuxGame</p>
<p>Matthew Gera, RubyPlay’s commercial director, also shared his thoughts on the partnership agreement. He lauded NuxGame’s excellence in service, account management and responsiveness. As a result of these qualities, NuxGame is the perfect partner for RubyPlay, Gera said.</p>
<p>Alongside NuxGame’s robust operator cluster and international reach, we are sure that our next generation of games will enrich their platform, while providing RubyPlay with the reach and distribution network that NuxGame has built. Matthew Gera, commercial director, RubyPlay</p>
<p>The deal with RubyPlay is the latest in a string of agreements that has seen NuxGame partner with companies such as Ainsworth Game Technology, Turbo Games, Elbet and Pascal Games.</p>
<p>RubyPlay, on the other hand recently agreed to power LeoVegas with slot games. Prior to that, the studio rolled out content with PokerStars and created a bespoke slot for Holland Casino Online.</p>
