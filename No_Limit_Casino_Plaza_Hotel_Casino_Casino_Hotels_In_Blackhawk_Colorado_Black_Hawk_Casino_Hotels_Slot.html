    <h1>No Limit Casino Plaza Hotel Casino Casino Hotels In Blackhawk Colorado Black Hawk Casino Hotels Slot</h1>

<p>Hi team.</p>
<p>I'd like to explain why we do this and what's going on in general.</p>
<p>Withdrawal to the international bank occurs through our partners. Each withdrawal costs us from 10 to 15 euros, depending on the market.</p>
<p>It was decided to reimburse part of this amount to clients, so we took 7 euros and set this price for all markets (we compensate this by the fact that there is no commission on cryptocurrencies).</p>
<p>Further, payments to the bank are made automatically. Client data must be perfectly accurate for the bank to accept it. The client fills out a payment request and the data automatically goes to the bank.</p>
<p>If at least some data does not match, the payment is returned to us after a short pause. We are charged 25 euros for attempting to process a payment with incorrect data. This is not our commission but that of the payment system.</p>
<p>You can find the respective paragraph in our rules:</p>
<p>8.3.1 In case if the player enters incorrect bank details in his account, trying to withdraw to a bank of another country (the country of residence must be the same as the country where the bank is registered), trying to withdraw to Revolut (this is only possible if you live in Lithuania) Tsars reserves the right to charge a â‚¬25 fee for each failed (returned) withdrawal.</p>
<p>We are sorry that the client had to face this fact, but before filling out a request for payment, we insist that the data is 100% correct because the banks do not tolerate mistakes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not have a huge load of various commissions, not all commissions are paid by the client, but we can not be held responsible for correct or incorrect completion of the application for a payout.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the client received his payment, and his account is still active. We can only congratulate him on his winnings.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Andrei</p>
