<p>New York Giants Licking Their Wounds After a Blowout Loss Last Week</p>
<p>Last weekend, the New York Giants suffered their fifth loss of the 2022 season. And it was a big one. They got blown out by the Philadelphia Eagles 48-22, which is their biggest loss since September 2020.</p>
<p>It was their third defeat in the space of four weeks – the only game that they didn’t lose in that period was the tie with the Commanders in Week 13.</p>
<p>They do seem to have big plans for the near future as evident from the fact that coach Brian Daboll decided to take starting QB Daniel Jones in the fourth quarter of the Eagles game to ensure he’s fit for the Week 15 clash with the Commanders. Speaking of fitness, RB Saquon Barkley seems to have finally shaken off a neck injury that was bothering him for weeks.</p>
<p>Washington Commanders Have Had Plenty of Time to Prepare for Week 15</p>
<p>The Commanders are coming off a bye which seems to have come at the right moment for them. They got some tough fixtures ahead, meaning that winning in Week 15 is a must if they wish to stay in the race for a playoff berth.</p>
<p>In fact, if you take a look at the betting odds, you’ll see that the Commanders are the favorites in only one of their four remaining games. The game in question? The Week 15 clash with their divisional rivals.</p>
<p>They were favored in their first duel of the season as well. However, the game finished in a tie, in which the Giants had a field goal attempt in the overtime. The Commanders can count themselves lucky for not losing that game, and this time, they need to do much better.</p>
<p>New York Giants vs Washington Commanders Prediction</p>
<p>The Giants are without a single win since Week 10, coming off a blowout loss last weekend. They will certainly do their best to get back on the winning track, but the fact is that player quality is on the side of the Commanders.</p>
<p>The boys from Washington failed to beat the New Yorkers last time. This time, we think they’re going to pull it off.</p>
<p>Picks: Washington Commanders to win and cover the spread</p>
