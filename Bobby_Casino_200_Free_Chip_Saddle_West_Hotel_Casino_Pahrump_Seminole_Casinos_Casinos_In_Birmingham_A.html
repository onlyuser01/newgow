    <h1>Bobby Casino 200 Free Chip Saddle West Hotel Casino Pahrump Seminole Casinos Casinos In Birmingham A</h1>

<p>In Dec I made a deposit for XRP, the deposit, the truth is, I forgot, in January I received the confirmation that the deposit had barely reached the client, it is not a lot of money anyway, I asked in the 1xbet chat if the balance could be credited. They suggested that I send the information to info-en@1xbet-team.com where the truth is that when I saw them I sent all the information about the transaction that I have, which literally are captures and blockchain numbers confirming that a deposit was made to their wallet. The 1xbet staff has frustrated me not because my account has not been credited, but because of the lack of will to help because since I sent my email they answer me every 4 to 5 days later if it is not to tell me not to deposit in their site is that it was because I put the wrong information and the deposit went to another client.</p>
<p>To make deposits by XRP ask for 2 things</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>that it is deposited in the correct wallet and XRP wallet that if it is not from an XRP wallet to XRP 10 out of 10 times your wallet tells you that the wallets are not compatible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That you correctly put the Message number that it provides you on your deposit page at 1xbet now I don't know about you but I always use copy paste when it is an important numerical code or that I have to copy from place A to place B so as not to make mistakes. And because it's money, one even checks everything 2 or 3 times before submitting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The truth is that I give up, the amount is not worth it, but the answers that they have given me are like they answer whatever it is to see what I believe and they do not take you into account as a client when trying to make a complaint in the chat, they put it aside My complaint to give more importance to the fact that the last time they helped me in English and now it was in Spanish. Why so many languages if there is no attempt to help or solve problems in any of them? Since I couldn't leave my complaint on 1xbet, or rather nobody blew my mind, I leave it here since I really use this page a lot to make decisions when I want to enter a new casino.</p>
