    <h1>Vegas Strip Casino Closest Casino To My Location Aqueduct Casino Bet Us Casino Don Laughlin Casino C</h1>

<p>Dear Ashthompson,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for the self-exclusion or for deposit limits? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gaming section on the website, and this is what I found https://www.casinonic.com/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion Limit. You can set a Self-Exclusion Limit for 6 months, 9 months, or 1 year. Upon doing so your Player Account will immediately be disabled and you will be excluded from all promotional offers for the set period. You will not be able to deposit or withdraw funds when the limit is active. Upon its expiring your account will automatically be re-activated. Please note that if you are self excluded from the casino for indefinite period of time, the funds remaining on balance will be paid according to the casino limits. If you are self excluded for a definite period of time, the funds remaining on balance will be paid according to the casino limits only when a period of self exclusion expires."</p>
<p>„SELF-EXCLUSION BY REQUEST</p>
<p>You may also contact our support team at support@casinoniс.com and inform us about your decision to stop gambling at the Website for a certain period of time or forever. We will take all measures to block your access to your account and make sure that you receive no promotional materials."</p>
<p>Is the email address mentioned above, that one, you have sent your emails to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
