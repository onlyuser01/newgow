    <h1>Konocti Casino Harrah S Maryland Heights Casino Clearwater Casino Hotel Crown Casino Sonesta Maho Be</h1>

<p>Very good afternoon and thank you very much for your speed with this matter. I will try to give you all the information you request in parts:</p>
<p>-The 1600 euros claimed are those derived from the deposits made less withdrawals. This is an estimate since, unfortunately, I do not have the exact figure. That amount would have to be provided by "Wazamba", but I have not received a response from them.</p>
<p>-I understand that you have a limitation regarding licensing regulations and policies and that is why I thank you even more for accepting this claim. What I ask of you is that you help me get in touch with "Wazamba", since for months they have not responded to my emails.</p>
<p>-As for the other complaints in casinos owned by SMES (Solutions for Management and Employment Support NV) such as "Rolling Slots" and "Oxi Casino", you have already seen that they accepted the return of my deposits for the same reasons that I explain in this claim.</p>
<p>-As for my last communications with "Wazamba", the only response I received was one automatically generated in their system:</p>
<p>Your request (10321332) has been received and is being reviewed by our support staff.</p>
<p>To add additional comments, reply to this email.</p>
<p>The last time I received a message like this was on August 31, 2023 and they still haven't given me a response. Seeing that it was impossible to contact them through support@wazamba.com and vip@wazamba.com, I tried through the "live chat" on their website. This service has quite a few limitations and did not allow them to access the status of my claim. They just told me to wait. This is a copy of one of the conversations with said chat dated September 15, 2023 (I have the transcripts if you need it):</p>
<p>Cenk</p>
<p>Thank you for waiting</p>
<p>Cenk</p>
<p>The relevant team stated that the case is still under review therefore we need to wait for an update.</p>
<p>Philip</p>
<p>But it's been two months</p>
<p>Philip</p>
<p>And they haven't even responded to my last messages</p>
<p>Cenk</p>
<p>I know but since the case is still under review we need to wait</p>
<p>Philip</p>
<p>I can't believe this matter has dragged on so long.</p>
<p>Philip</p>
<p>How long? Three more months? Six? One year?</p>
<p>Philip</p>
<p>In any case, I greatly appreciate you speaking to the appropriate department.</p>
<p>Philip</p>
<p>He is the first one to help me with this matter.</p>
<p>Cenk</p>
<p>As we are not part of the relevant team I do not know the exact time about the response.</p>
<p>Cenk</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is nothing to do at this moment. We are still waiting for an update from the relevant department.</p>
<p>As you can see, this type of contact does not provide any type of information. If you could help me with this matter I would be eternally grateful. Anyway, thanks for your time and attention.</p>
