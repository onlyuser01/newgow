    <h1>Trump Casino Turning Stone Casino Lodge Mgm Vegas Casino Login Florida Casino Warhorse Casino EUcasi</h1>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>seeks good advice / experience in similar.</p>
<p>Created me and deposited DKK 500 at eucasino. Got a bonus of the same amount and then played my roll up to DKK 16,000. The bonus was released below.</p>
<p>after a few days I withdrew the money. In the meantime, I submitted documents, ie passports, etc., which were approved.</p>
<p>I then received gd an email in which they canceled my payout. They sent an email shortly after that they had approved a payment of DKK 1,500, which is also stated in my payment history.</p>
<p>in the email about the cancellation they wrote that the money was sent back to my account…</p>
<p>The process itself is strange in itself, but my account is at zero and they do not respond to any inquiries. Neither live chat nor email. The place is approved by the authorities and you must log in with easy ID, etc. ……</p>
<p>Regards Casper T <strong><em>*</em></strong></p>
