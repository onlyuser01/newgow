    <h1>Red Dog Casino No Deposit Bonus Menominee Casino Resort Hollywood Park Casino Parking Choctaw Casino</h1>

<p>On bet365 I started winning and they shut down the account and deleted it with my 400 EURO (4000SEK) still on there.</p>
<p>I have done nothing to break any rules. I've been in contact with them and telling them to open up my account with my money on. They have requested a money trail from my bank to show them that I played with money I already won at their own site, bet365. I have sent the bank statements at least 10 times already, and they are the correct info, correct file, correct everything.</p>
<p>They always answer that they couldn't verify the info. Next time they tell me to sent the same bank statement I already sent. Sometimes they switch it up and they ask for bank statements for a different month but I have sent all the months statements soooo many times.</p>
<p>This has been going on for at least 2 months. Please help me Im so frustrated. Thank You! / Joakim</p>
