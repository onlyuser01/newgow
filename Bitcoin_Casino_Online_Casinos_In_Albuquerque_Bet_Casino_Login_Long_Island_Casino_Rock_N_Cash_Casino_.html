<p>One of Premier League’s topflight football clubs has made an interesting announcement, with Everton FC revealing KICK as its new sleeve and streaming partner. The collaboration has been hailed by both companies and this makes the latest sports franchise to associate itself with the fast-evolving and growing streaming platform that was launched in October 2022.</p>
<p>KICK has built a unique community-driven online streaming experience and has challenged platforms such as Twitch and YouTube in the process. More importantly, KICK has launched with a 95-5 split between content creators and the platform.</p>
<p>Moving forward, KICK’s logo will be displayed on Everton FC’s Men’s Senior Team which will be introduced in the pre-season friendly game versus Sporting CP on Saturday. The KICK sponsorship will also cover the Women's and Everton Under-21 Teams,which will also sport the KICK logo on their sleeves during the 2023/2024 season.</p>
<p>KICK is effectively the Official Sleeve Partner and Official Streaming Partner for the football club, and its branding and imagery will be seen across physical spaces at Goodison Park, Finch Farm, and Walton Hall Park. On top of that, KICK will be visible across Everton FC’s digital spaces.</p>
<p>KICK already has more than 80 million site visits every month, which is a significant audience that Everton will also be able to tap into. The synergies between both companies are clearly-established, as both will gain further momentum from their presence in the sports and gaming worlds.</p>
<p>Everton Chief Commercial &amp; Communications Officer Richard Kenyon said that the team was pleased to announce this opportunity with the team. There are already plans in the works about various match experiences that will start with the game against Sporting CP. Not least, Kenyon said that the team was looking forward to working with KICK and achieving impressive growth together.</p>
<p>"We look forward to working with KICK and presenting new opportunities for our supporters, while providing valuable global exposure for KICK as they continue their impressive growth," Kenyon wrapped up. The partnership was welcomed by KICK Director of Acquisition Akhil Sarin who was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that it was great to see the platform join forces with a global football powerhouse.</p>
<p>KICK is backed by a number of streamers and famous personalities, including but not limited to Drake and former Twitch streamer xQc.</p>
