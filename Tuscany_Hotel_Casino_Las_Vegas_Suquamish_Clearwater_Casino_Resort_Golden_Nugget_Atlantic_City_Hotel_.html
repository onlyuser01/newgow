    <h1>Tuscany Hotel Casino Las Vegas Suquamish Clearwater Casino Resort Golden Nugget Atlantic City Hotel</h1>

<p>Wynn Macau has decided to give all of its (or nearly all) employees a holiday bonus that will be paid out this month. The bonus reflects not so much on the holiday season but rather on the dedication with which members of the team have worked through the nadir of the pandemic and coped with a challenging health environment throughout 2021.</p>
<p>Resilient Workforce in Macau</p>
<p>Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace employees who have been deemed eligible account for 97.8% of the company’s workforce, or almost 12,000 employees. All of them will receive the equivalent of a full salary on January 28.</p>
<p>Wynn Macau said that it appreciated the efforts exerted by members of its teams and that it was through that collective effort that the casinos and hotels were able to stay afloat and even begin to show signs of recovery. In an official statement, the company said:</p>
<p>“With the exceptional level of loyalty, commitment and discipline demonstrated by all Wynn team members, the company has been able to ensure the continuity and enhancement of its renowned service culture and hospitality standards and helped to protect the health of all colleagues and Wynn guests.” Wynn Macau</p>
<p>Macau has been one of the holdout places on Earth where COVID-19 seems to fare very poorly. In fact, the special administrative region (SAR) had very few infections until recently, when two imported cases of the new Omicron strain were detected last week.</p>
<p>Part of the recovery of the region was also contingent on China allowing players from the highland to travel to Macau. However, the region has been deprived of travelers from other destinations, putting a strain on the economy.</p>
<p>Signs of Recovery in Macau</p>
<p>Wynn has remained fairly positive, realizing the value of the Macau market and being fully prepared to weather the storm in Asia only to recover after the pandemic is over. Not only that, but Macau already saw a strong recovery of gross gaming revenue (GGR) in 2021. Hopes are that Omicron won’t crimp the results and allow developments to continue.</p>
<p>Macau is also prepared to weather new strains of the virus. Vaccination campaigns have been going strong, with over 94% of the workforce now fully vaccinated. The bonus move by Macau has inspired others as well, with Galaxy Entertainment and MGM China piling on and announcing a one-time discretionary allowance or payment to their workforce.</p>
<p>Most impressive of all is Sands China, the subsidiary of the company built by the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, which vowed to pay a discretionary allowance to over 25,000 full-time team members in Macau.</p>
