<p>Yes. I too believe that is what a sticky bonus is.</p>
<p>But this casino has a completely different set of rules.</p>
<p>For example, if you deposit $100 and get a $100 bonus,</p>
<p>combined, you start with a $200 bonus.</p>
<p>When you meet the wagering requirements, you have $150.</p>
<p>Then, the first bonus of $100 is subtracted from that,</p>
<p>Subtract the remaining $50 from the first $100 bonus, which is $50.</p>
<p>As a result, this $50 is said to be the sticky bonus,</p>
<p>In fact, it immediately disappears from the balance, leaving only $100 in cash.</p>
<p>And the higher the percentage of the bonus, the more of the balance that disappears.</p>
<p>For example, if you deposit $100 and get a $200 bonus,</p>
<p>combined, you start with a $300 bonus.</p>
<p>Suppose you have $200 when you meet the wagering requirements.</p>
<p>Then, subtract the first bonus of $200 from it,</p>
<p>Subtract the remaining $0 from the first bonus of $200, which is $200.</p>
<p>And there is no cash left because the $200 is immediately eliminated from your balance.</p>
<p>I have been to several casinos and this is the first time I have seen such a complicated system.</p>
<p>The casino claims it is a sticky bonus, but it is almost a scam.</p>
