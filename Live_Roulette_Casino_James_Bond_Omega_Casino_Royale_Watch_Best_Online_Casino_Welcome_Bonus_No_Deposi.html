<p>Stefanos Tsitsipas Dreaming of His First Grand Slam Title</p>
<p>The 24-year-old Greek has never won a major tournament. He did, however, come very close to doing so on a few occasions. In 2021, for instance, he played in the final of the French Open but lost 3-2 to Novak Djokovic.</p>
<p>With one more win, Stefanos Tsitsipas may become:</p>

<p>Still, it’s the Australian Open where he plays his best tennis. He played in three semifinals of the Melbourne Grand Slam, including the one in this year’s tournament. In that match, he defeated Karen Khachanov 3-1 after 3:21 hours of play.</p>
<p>Tsitsipas showed that he’s in peak physical condition in that game, which is something that needs to worry his opponent in the AO2023 final.</p>
<p>Problems Keep Pilling on for Novak Djokovic</p>
<p>The record-holder for most Australian Open Men’s Singles titles (9 wins) is reportedly having problems with fitness. As admitted by the Serbian player, he’s been taking a lot of painkillers to get him through the AO matches. He’s also been skipping practice, limiting it to only a warm-up session before each match.</p>
<p>Still, his fitness issues haven’t been showing on the court. The guy’s won five of his six Australian Open 2023 matches in straight sets. This includes the semifinal duel with Tommy Paul, which did seem as if it’s going to be a much more dramatic affair.</p>
<p>The American started in top gear, losing the first set by a close margin (7-5 in games). Then, in the next two sets, Djokovic absolutely destroyed him – Paul won just three sets in the remainder of the match.</p>
<p>The question is whether Novak has it in him to put on another superb performance. It’s not only because of fitness problems but also because the crowd at Rod Lever Arena probably won’t be on his side.</p>
<p>If you think it’s because of the last year’s scandal (when Djokovic was denied entry to Australia due to being unvaxxed), you’re wrong. The crowd won’t be rooting for him for a more recent scandal – his father Srdjan celebrated Novak’s semifinal win with fans waving Russian flags with Putin’s face on them.</p>
<p>Stefanos Tsitsipas vs Novak Djokovic Prediction</p>
<p>Although we doubt Tsitsipas has it in him to defeat Djokovic (he lost their previous 8 duels), we are 100% certain he can give him a run for his money. Tsitsipas will go all-in on Sunday, which should result in him winning at least one set.</p>
<p>Pick: Stefanos Tsitsipas +2.5 Sets</p>
