<p>A person was found dead at Paragon Casino Resort in Louisiana on Friday morning. The death comes less than two months after the discovery of another corpse at the gaming property.</p>

<p>The man was found in a hotel room. It is unclear what led to his death. He reportedly was identified as Jacob Paul, 40.</p>
<p>Toxicology Tests Taken</p>
<p>Authorities are awaiting the results of an autopsy and toxicology tests. The Tunica-Biloxi Tribal Police Department is investigating Paul’s passing.</p>
<p>In a statement from Paragon Casino Resort, officials said they were “saddened by the recent death… As always, the safety and security of all of our guests is our primary concern, and our thoughts continue to be with the family and friends of the deceased at this time.”</p>
<p>In both deaths, an initial autopsy revealed neither person died from a stabbing nor gunshots, Avoyellestoday.com, a regional news site, reported.</p>
<p>It was on Oct. 3, the body of Giah Barrere, 17, was discovered at hotel grounds. Officials have yet to identify her cause of death.</p>
<p>Following her passing, a 21-year-old was arrested. The charge is failure to seek assistance.</p>
<p>The suspect was identified as Alexis Noel Dauzat, 21, of Marksville, La, KALB, a local TV station, reported.</p>
<p>Louisiana statutes require that anyone at an emergency provide “reasonable assistance” to someone who “has suffered serious bodily injury.” That means seeking or reporting the need for medical assistance.</p>
<p>Tunica-Biloxi Police Chief Harold Pierite, Sr. said additional charges and arrests “are foreseeable” in her death.</p>
<p>The Paragon Casino Resort was opened in 1994. The Marksville, La. gaming complex is located some 88 miles northwest of Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>Drugs, Mental Health</p>
<p>Following the teen’s death, relatives revealed she had been struggling with drugs and mental health issues.</p>
<p>It particularly troubles the family because Barrere was unable to get assistance for her personal issues because of a lack of juvenile resource centers in central Louisiana, KALB reported.</p>
<p>“It’s a parent’s worst nightmare,” Donna Barrere, Giah’s mother, was quoted by KALB. “I don’t want anyone else’s parents to go through what I’m going through.”</p>
<p>Avoyelles Parish District Attorney Charles Riddle agreed more resources are needed to help teenagers. “We’ve seen them commit suicide. We’ve seen them overdose. And we’ve seen them go to violent crime,” Riddle told KALB about support services for teens.</p>
<p>There are no rehabilitation centers nearby, he added. A proposal to build a center to help teens before they find themselves getting sentenced is currently before the Louisiana legislature.</p>
<p>The 32-bed facility was proposed for the town of Pollock in Grant Parish. It would help those teens who are struggling with drug addiction or emotional issues, officials explained.</p>
<p>As proposed, patients would get counseling during a one- or two-month stay. They could also continue attending school while in the center. So far, $1 million was approved for its construction. It should get full funding by next October, Riddle said.</p>
