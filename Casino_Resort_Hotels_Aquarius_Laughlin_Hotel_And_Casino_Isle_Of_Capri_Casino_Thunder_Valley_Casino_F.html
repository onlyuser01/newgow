<p>Yahoo will integrate Wagr into its Yahoo Sports division following a deal the terms of which remained undisclosed</p>
<p>Yahoo has announced the acquisition of Wagr, a social sports betting app. This major development is in line with Yahoo Sports’ efforts to create exciting betting and fantasy products for sports aficionados.</p>
<p>Wagr excels in mobile-first content and uses its customers’ experience to keep on improving its products. Now, this cutting-edge company will be fully integrated into Yahoo Sports. However, the terms of the agreement were not released to the public.</p>
<p>Yahoo is extremely happy with its new acquisition, especially considering that Wagr is the first social sports betting company to have ever been licensed in the US. As the platform that pioneered social betting in America, Wagr boasts years of experience in creating unforgettable experiences.</p>
<p>Wagr has a proven appeal which has helped it attract numerous customers and investors.</p>
<p>The Integration Will Help Wagr Expand Its Audience</p>
<p>Executives from the two companies commented on the M&amp;A deal. Jum Lanzone, Yahoo’s chief executive officer, said that the acquisition is a major step in the development of the next-gen Yahoo Sports gaming portfolio. He praised Wagr for its outstanding focus on social sports betting and said that these values perfectly align with Yahoo’s award-winning fantasy platform.</p>
<p>Wagr stands out for its innovative emphasis on community and social engagement in sports gaming, which aligns perfectly with the Yahoo award-winning fantasy platform that has brought tens of millions of fans together around their love of sports for over 20 years. Jum Lanzone, CEO, Yahoo</p>
<p>Yahoo Sports’ senior vice president, Jon Shaw, also shared his thoughts, welcoming Wagr to the Yahoo Sports family. He said that Yahoo Sports is already committed to providing fans with engaging sports content. However, Wagr’s community-oriented approach will really help Yahoo Sports step up its game, allowing friend groups to compete together, while enjoying the sports content they love.</p>
<p>Acquiring Wagr creates an immediate opportunity for us to expand into new group formats that can take engagement and friendly competition to the next level. Jon Shaw, SVP, Yahoo Sports</p>
<p>Finally, Mario Malavé, Wagr’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said that he is just as excited about the agreement since it will provide his company with a “stage to build products” that will reach millions of long-term sports fans.</p>
<p>“The unique combination of Yahoo’s scale and engagement creates opportunities for virtuous product loops between sports media and gaming,” Malavé said, adding that he is excited to join Yahoo and continue delivering content to fans.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows an agreement between Wagr and WagerWire that saw the two companies join forces last December.</p>
