<p>The company’s management commented on their satisfaction by the participation of HG Vora ,a fund that operates on behalf of some of its affiliates, in the merger.</p>
<p>“As we seek to execute against our many growth initiatives and deliver additional shareholder value, we are excited to partner with Leisure and appreciative of the confidence in our future as demonstrated by HG Vora’s investment commitment, “ they said.</p>
<p>HG Vora participates in the merger with a commitment of $30 million. Totally the company has invested a capital of more than $100 million so far</p>
