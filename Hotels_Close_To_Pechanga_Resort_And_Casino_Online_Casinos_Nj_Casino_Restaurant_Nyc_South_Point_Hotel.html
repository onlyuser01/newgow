<p>"My account has been closed due to problems with the ONLINE game" -</p>
<p>That's the message the support team received on January 17 and there was no reason to send that message to the security department. There is no mention of GAME ADDICTION / GAMBLING PROBLEM or anything similar to gambling addiction. The message does say there is a problem with the ONLINE game.</p>
<p>"On January 17, I requested the closure of my account due to problems with online gambling, attaching a copy of my ID. They have not closed my account and I request the return of all the amounts deposited since that date.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why they didn't close my account when I requested it since I attached my ID and explained my problem.</p>
<p>From what I see I sent it to support and nobody sent it to security??? Because that message was sent to me 11 days after sending the message that I have a serious problem with online gambling and attaching my ID photo. I think it is more than necessary for them to close my account or how they have done in this claim to derive it directly." -</p>
<p>This is the message the support team received on February 19. The client duplicates the problem with the online game, but also demands a refund of deposits and promises to go complaint to the regulatory authorities. Due to such a detailed form of threats and demands, the correspondence was handed over to the security department. After carefully reviewing the correspondence, the security department concluded that by "problem with the ONLINE game" the player meant something else - an online gaming addiction problem. As a result, the client's account was permanently blocked.</p>
