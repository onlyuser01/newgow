<p>Washington Caps Off Vegas Golden Knights’ Storied Run in Stanley Cup Final, Just One Game Away from Win</p>

<p>The Washington Capitals are a single victory away from winning their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. If they do, the Vegas Golden Knights’ history-making run will come to a disappointing close.</p>

<p>The Caps dominated Game 4 Monday night in Washington, DC. They took a 3-0 lead in the first period, and while Vegas managed to get the score to 4-2 in the third, it never felt close, and the Capitals added two more goals to win 6-2.</p>
<p>Now up three games to one, Washington needs just one more win to claim the team’s first Stanley Cup Trophy in its 44-year history.</p>
<p>The Golden Knights have overcome long odds all year. They smashed a 24-year-old record for the number of NHL games won by a first-year team, and became the first team to reach the Stanley Cup Playoffs in their inaugural season since 1979-80.</p>
<p>Now forced to win three in a row against a very good Capitals team, the Golden Knights will need to once more overcome improbable odds.</p>
<p>Game 5 is back in Las Vegas at T-Mobile Arena on Thursday. The puck drops at 5 pm PT (8 pm ET).</p>
<p>Sportbooks believe the Knights will regroup and push the series to Game 6. Vegas is the favorite for Thursday at -140 (implied chances of winning 58 percent). A $100 bet and a Knights win nets $71.43.</p>
<p>Not a Done Deal</p>
<p>In a city where millions come to test their luck inside casinos, the Vegas Golden Knights are hoping for nothing short of a jackpot win. Just one team in NHL history has come back from a 3-1 Stanley Cup Playoffs deficit.</p>
<p>ESPN hockey writers Emily Kaplan and Greg Wyshynski say the odds are against the Knights winning the Cup, but remind fans not to count them out.</p>
<p>Need we remind you that this is a team that opened with 500/1 odds to win the Stanley Cup? That every member of this self-proclaimed band of misfits felt slighted at some point in the past year … It feels fitting for them to have to overcome an even greater deficit to claim the grand prize,” Kaplan and Wyshynski concluded.</p>
<p>Vegas didn’t necessarily play poorly in Game 4, but needed just a couple of bounces to go their way. Caps goaltender Braden Holtby admitted, “We obviously got some breaks.”</p>
<p>Vegas Wins Regardless</p>
<p>Should the Washington Capitals hoist the Stanley Cup when the best-of-seven series is over, Las Vegas casinos will actually see their coffers flushed with an estimated $5 million to $7 million. That’s because numerous sportsbooks across town printed futures on the Knights prior to the start of the regular season at extremely long odds.</p>
<p>Printed slips now in serious jeopardy of becoming worthless include a $400 bet on 300/1 odds (would pay $120,000), a $500 bet at 200/1 that would net $100,000, and a small $60 wager on 500/1 odds (pays $30,000).</p>
<p>While a Capitals win would bring the Golden Knights history-making season to a close, it would be absurd to label the end result a failure.</p>
<p>Disappointing, perhaps, but few could have reasonably predicted such success for Las Vegas’ first major pro sports team.</p>
