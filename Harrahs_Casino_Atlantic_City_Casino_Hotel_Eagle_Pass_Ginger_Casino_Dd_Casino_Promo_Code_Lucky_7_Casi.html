<p>Leading online gaming company EveryMatrix has revealed Ashley Bloor as its next business owner of Remote Gaming Server (RGS) Matrix. As a seasoned veteran, Bloor brings a lot of industry-related experience, having served various stints with William Hill, and Ladbrokes and Entain’s predecessors, Gala Coral Group and GVC respectively.</p>
<p>She was in charge of gaming solutions at GiG or Gaming Innovation Group prior to taking up this new opportunity within EveryMatrix’s family. Moving forward, Bloor will be responsible for product development and boosting revenue streams. Bloor will directly supervise personnel and create processes that allow EveryMatrix to continue delivering robust financial results while fulfilling customer needs.</p>
<p>Commenting on this appointment, Bloor had this to add: “I am very excited to have the opportunity of working with EveryMatrix. The company has a thick and sturdy product portfolio, and I am looking forward to shaping and developing the RGS platform offering by working alongside our gaming partners, including the Spearhead Studios team.”</p>
<p>She was welcomed by the company and RGS Matrix’s managing director, Mathias Larsson, who expressed confidence that with Bloor onboard, RGS Matrix will continue to play a pivotal role in the company’s strategy and offer even more solutions to consumers and customers in the coming months.</p>
<p>Boosting RGS Matrix through the Right Hires</p>
<p>Bringing highly skilled and trained people is EveryMatrix’s current focus, Larsson assured. “Her extensive experience will push RGS Matrix forward and I can’t wait to work together with such a talented professional,” he added commenting on Bloom’s portfolio.</p>
<p>RGS Matrix is a powerful product that allows first and third-party teams to build games. The software provides further benefits, such as the necessary tools to distribute, manage and report results and progress. As a whole, RGS Matrix combines a selection of slots, table, and instant win games.</p>
<p>The company has rallied products from numerous companies, including its own proprietary studios, Armadillo Studios, and Spearhead Studios. RGS Matrix has a significant breadth of operation as it’s already licensed in 12 jurisdictions across Europe and Latin America, with the company planning a launch in the United States soon.</p>
<p>Bloor has been working out of Marbella, Spain since October 1 and she will work closely with EveryMatrix and Spearhead Studios. Apart from boosting existing operations, she will seek creative solutions to increase the lifespan of individual products that are launching under the RGS Matrix banner.</p>
