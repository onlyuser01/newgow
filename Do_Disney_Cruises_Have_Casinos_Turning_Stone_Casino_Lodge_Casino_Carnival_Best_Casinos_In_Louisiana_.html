<p>WildCard Wallet is a digital wallet powered by Everi’s CashClub Wallet solution and offers cashless, contactless funding of electronic gameplay throughout the casino floor.</p>
<p>CashClub Wallet Expands to More Markets with WildCard Wallet After its Recent Launch</p>
<p>On Monday, entertainment and technology solutions provider Everi Holdings announced it was bringing its mobile wallet technology to the state of Florida. The operator has entered into an agreement with Seminole Tribe of Florida to launch the WildCard Wallet across casinos operated by Seminole Gaming.</p>
<p>The Wildcard Wallet is powered by Everi’s CashClub Wallet solution and is currently available for funding electronic casino play, restaurant and bar purchases, as well as purchases at retail outlets inside the Seminole’s flagship Hard Rock Hollywood near Fort Lauderdale and at the Seminole Classic Casino, also in Hollywood, Everi said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Benefits of Cashless Payments in a Covid-19 World</p>
<p>Cashless or digital payment technology for casinos has become a worldwide trend in the past months. Even though casinos and cash seem to go hand by hand, experts say the introduction of cashless and contactless technology for financial transactions by casino players is likely to gain momentum amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The tendency was already a fact before the health crisis hit, but now the process is accelerating due to the benefits of increased player safety and reduced in-person interactions.</p>
<p>Seminole Tribe of Florida and Everi Holdings plan to roll out the mobile wallet in all six of the tribe’s casinos in Florida, including Hard Rock Tampa, by the end of March. The technology provider was recognized with a gold medal award for Best Slot Product for The Vault and with a silver medal award for Best Consumer-Service Technology for its CashClub Wallet Core Edition from Global Gaming Business as part of their 19th Annual Gaming and Technology Awards.</p>
<p>“The WildCard Wallet eliminates the need to handle cash at slot machines, creating a frictionless experience for the customer and allowing all patrons with flexible options to fund their gaming experience.” John Eder, CFO, Seminole Gaming &amp; Hard Rock International</p>
<p>Eder added that the innovative solution will enhance the security and facilitate the funding transactions as well as the compatibility with other back-office tools to support operations, such as anti-money laundering, identification of customer activities, and providing tax forms for casino winnings.</p>
<p>WinStar World Casino Resort is the First Property to Launch Everi’s Digital Wallet</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Everi announced the company’s digital wallet platform debuted on the market at Oklahoma’s WinStar World Casino Resort. Everi Holdings and WinStar World Casino and Resort announced the launch of WinStar Wallet powered by Everi’s CashClub Wallet on December 3. Las Vegas-based Everi said the partnership will result in a great amount of usage data.</p>
