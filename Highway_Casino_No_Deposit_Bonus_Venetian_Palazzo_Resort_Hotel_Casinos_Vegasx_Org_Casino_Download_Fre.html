    <h1>Highway Casino No Deposit Bonus Venetian Palazzo Resort Hotel Casinos Vegasx Org Casino Download Fre</h1>

<p>ELA Games has become the latest supplier to join EveryMatrix’s growing network of partners. The company is an advanced developer of iGaming solutions that is now integrated with EveryMatrix’s proprietary CasinoEngine aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Through CasinoEngine, partner operators can get access to thousands of hand-picked and curated games developed by some of the finest companies in the industry, including ELA Games.</p>
<p>The distribution deal with the B2B tech provider was revealed as a part of a press release, and detailed the full nature of the collaboration. ELA Games is confident that this new tie-up will allow the company to significantly scale up its presence and inject into EveryMatrix’s partner operators a number of excellent games. Commenting on this opportunity EveryMatrix Head of Casino Engine Stian Enger said:</p>
<p>"As we continue to expand globally, our aim is to continually add fresh, new games studios that can add a unique element to our offering, the largest casino content library in the industry."</p>
<p>ELA Games will similarly seek to inject its products into various markets and jurisdictions, focusing on scaling up its offer consistently and reliably over the coming months.</p>
<p>As to the type of games that the company features, ELA Games has long been committed to developing products that stand out by virtue of their excellent visuals and gameplay mechanics. Enger agreed that ELA Games makes for a great addition to CasinoEngine’s constantly growing list of partners.</p>
<p>Popular choices by ELA Games include VikingsWild, Ed’s Gun, Bandidos Cash, and Detective Fortunes, among many other titles. ELA Games takes pride in the fact that its games have a unique and highly-distinctive signature style that allow them to be quickly made out of in-game libraries and associated with the company’s brand.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, ELA Games has around 13 games, and it has created such distinctly unique titles as Jungle Tangle and The Vilk and Little Red, both of which are excellent in their execution and development.</p>
<p>ELA Games Director of Gaming and Business Development Daniel Mitton was similarly stoked that his company had the chance to be teaming up with none other than EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>Mitton added that he was confident in the quality of his company’s products and was now excited to step up the distribution and outreach efforts with a partner such as EveryMatrix. EveryMatrix’s CasinoEngine has been making strides in various regions in the meantime, including Nigeria.</p>
