<p>In light of the Safer Gambling Week this year, Microgaming announced that it expanded its responsible gambling commitments.</p>
<p>Microgaming Extends Support for Betknowmore UK</p>
<p>The leading supplier of online gaming software, Microgaming, announced on Wednesday this week that it had enhanced its support for responsible gambling charities this year. The announcement coincides with the Safer Gambling Week 2021 as the company reaffirms its long-term commitment to responsible gambling and fair play.</p>
<p>Microgaming via its PlayItForward corporate social responsibility program extended its support to the leading provider of gambling support and training services Betknowmore UK. As a result, Betknowmore UK received a donation that will help fund the cost for a year-long trial for therapy groups for women. The new weekly peer-led group therapy sessions for women complement already existing peer support services offered by the organization.</p>
<p>The Company Helps the Gordon Moody Association, Motiv8 IOM Too</p>
<p>The Gordon Moody Association is helping with treatment services and therapy for people suffering from problem gambling. Moreover, the Association is helping families who have been impacted by gambling harm. Complementing a donation made last year, Microgaming once again supported the Association. The company revealed that its latest contribution will help “providing a comfort fund for the loved ones of those under the charity’s watch, as well as to assist with the purchase of furniture for the women’s outreach project.”</p>
<p>Microgaming has also collaborated with Isle of Man-based Motiv8 IOM. The organization provides education and treatment services and this year its gaming and gambling project focused on young people was sponsored by Microgaming.</p>
<p>Microgaming Is Proud to Support Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>Microgaming’s CEO, John Coleman, said that the company is proud to support the Safer Gambling Week. He added that responsible gambling should be a topic of discussion all year long. With that in mind, Coleman assured that Microgaming remains committed to responsible gambling. In conclusion, he said that he is proud that Microgaming can support gambling education, treatment, and research charities during 2021.</p>
<p>“We’re proudly standing in solidarity with all areas of our industry to support the Safer Gambling Week initiative, with a calendar of events to promote the Responsible Gambling message across our business.” John Coleman, CEO at Microgaming</p>
<p>Betknowmore UK CEO and founder Frankie Graham also shared his excitement. He acknowledged that the unique collaboration between Microgaming’s PlayItForward and Betknowmore UK will help the development of new research as well as support activities that help women and reduce gambling harms.</p>
