<p>The Las Vegas Raiders vs. Detroit Lions is the Monday Night Football game of Week 8 of the 2023 NFL season. The game is played at Ford Field in Detroit where the hosts are 2-0 against the boys from Nevada</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions have been great since the start of the 2023 NFL season, winning five of the seven games they’ve played so far. Led by Jared Goff, Detroit’s offense was great in all but the most recent games in which the Baltimore Ravens held them to just six points. This, actually, isn’t much of a surprise given that Baltimore’s defense is the best in the entire NFL.</p>
<p>Will the Lions be able to do better in Week 8 when their opponent is Las Vegas? Judging by the Week 8 MNF odds, they will. In fact, they’re expected to destroy the Raiders with the point spread being set to eight points.</p>

<p>Las Vegas Raiders Looking for Their First-Ever Win in Detroit</p>
<p>The Raiders lost both of their games against the Lions that took place in Detroit. However, it’s been a while since they last played at Ford Field. It was back in 2015, but these two did meet two more times in Nevada. Each of those was won by the Raiders.</p>
<p>But the Week 8 Monday Night Football game isn’t played in Nevada, but in Michigan. This should worry the Raiders are their form on the road has been horrible in 2023. After beating the Denver Broncos by one point on the road in the first round of the 2023 NFL season, they lost each of their next three away games.</p>
<p>They lost to the Buffalo Bills and the LA Chargers, which was expected, but in their most recent away game, they got thrashed by the Chicago Bears 30-12.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions Ready to Get Back to Their Winning Ways</p>
<p>The fact that they’re 5-2 on the season shows that in 2023, the Lions are a force to be reckoned with. These guys are the NFL’s 8th offense, averaging 24.9 points per game. That number would’ve been even higher if it wasn’t for the mishap in their most recent game, in which the Ravens beat them 38-6.</p>
<p>The loss to Baltimore was Detroit’s worst performance not only offensively but defensively as well. Conceding so many points is something that didn’t happen to them in over a year. In fact, up until the Ravens game, their defense was pretty solid, even against the NFL’s biggest offensive powerhouse, Kansas City.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Raiders vs. Detroit Lions Prediction</p>
<p>We think that the Raiders stand no chance in the MNF game of Week 8. The Lions will beat them, we’re almost 100% sure of that. Bookies think so as well, with their MNF odds suggesting that it’s not the question of who’s going to win in the final game of Week 8 but whether the Lions cover the spread. So, will they? They did it in their last two home games in the 2023 NFL, so why wouldn’t they do it again?</p>
<p>Picks: Detroit Lons to win and cover the spread</p>
