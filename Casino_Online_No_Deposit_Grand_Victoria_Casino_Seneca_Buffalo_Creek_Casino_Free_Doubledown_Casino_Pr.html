<p>Gems of Serengeti review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Gems of Serengeti is themed around Africa’s natural wonders, as well as a selection of precious stones.</p>
<p>Players will sling a backpack over their shoulder and join an exclusive safari trip. As well as the sunsets, they’ll discover majestic wild lions, along with a few unexpected treasures.</p>
<p>Animal lovers will appreciate the dream holiday that Gems of Serengeti offers.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Flute notes blend with bird calls to create an immersive soundtrack. From time to time, the cry of an elephant and the rumble of a storm contribute to the natural atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will meet a variety of animals, including lions, leopards, and vultures. Each of these creatures is animated in a realistic style, with sunlight giving them a soft glow.</p>
<p>Tribe members and a traditional tribal mask also appear on the reels. These symbols lean into the fantasy of the Gems of Serengeti world rather than offering a complex depiction of local culture.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, there is a savanna illuminated by the gold and pink hues of a sunset. Beside the reels, long grasses sway in the breeze, lending a sense of realism to the setting.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation create a peaceful world of natural beauty.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Gems of Serengeti has a 5x4 reel structure and 20 paylines.</p>
<p>This slot offers a maximum win of 4,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>The swift and smooth gameplay ensures that Gems of Serengeti remains engaging.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>When players land 5 or more Gem symbols, the Respin feature begins, starting with 3 respins. During this feature, the only symbols that remain on the reels are the Gem symbols as all other symbols disappear.</p>
<p>Whenever a Gem symbol lands during the Respin feature, it remains on the reels for the duration of the feature. The remaining respins are reset to 3 whenever a Gem symbol lands.</p>
<p>The Respin feature concludes when players either fill the reels entirely with Gem symbols or run out of respins. The prize awarded to players at the end of the Respin feature is decided by the number of Gem symbols on the reels. This prize can be as high as 500x the player’s total bet if there are 20 Gem symbols on the reels, or as low as 1x the player’s total bet if there are 3 Gem symbols on the reels.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Bonus symbols. The feature begins with 10 free spins, and players collect Gem symbols throughout the round. If players collect 5 Gem symbols, the Respin feature begins once the Free Spins have concluded.</p>
<p>A direct prize is awarded if players collect at least 20 Gem symbols while in the Free Spins feature. This prize can be 500x the player’s total bet if 20 Gem symbols are collected, or as high as 4,000x the player’s total bet if 27 Gem symbols are collected.</p>
<p>Players may not retrigger the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols with the exception of the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>

<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
