<p>Inter vs Porto is a Champions League Round of 16 clash between two in-form teams, which promises great entertainment for soccer fans</p>
<p>Both teams have been brilliant this season in practically all competitions. Inter Milan came to the knockout stage of the Champions League after finishing second in Group C, leaving the mighty Barcelona behind. Porto, on the other hand, finished top of Group B, in which Bayer Leverkusen and Atletico Madrid ended up without a UCL playoff berth.</p>
<p>Knowing that these two practically stopped the Champions League journey of a number of heavyweights shows how strong both Inter and Porto are. That said, their clash on Wednesday, February 22, is bound to be a real barnburner.</p>

<p>Inter Milan are Great on Home Turf</p>
<p>Inter Milan play home matches at one of the largest sports venues in Europe. Stadio Giuseppe Meazza a.k.a. San Siro is the eighth largest stadium on the continent in terms of capacity, with over 78,000 seats. Knowing this, it’s no surprise that I Nerazzurri usually play very well at home.</p>
<p>Sure, they did slip at home a couple of times this season, but they usually play very good soccer in big matches. In the Champions League, for example, they went 2-0-1 in Milan in the group phase, losing only to Bayern Munich who had all wins in that stage of the competition.</p>
<p>With the help of their fans, Inter Milan defeated a number of Italian heavyweights in Serie A this season, including AC Milan, Napoli, and so on.</p>
<p>Porto Haven’t Been This Good In Years</p>
<p>The Portuguese team hasn’t been this strong since the days of Jose Mourinho in the early 2000s. They are doing great in all competitions, winning practically every game they’ve played over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>They’re second in the Primeira, but the reason for that is that the Portuguese domestic league has become one of the toughest competitions in Europe. The evidence of this is that several Portuguese teams are dominating continental competitions this season.</p>
<p>One of those is Porto, which finished first in Group B of the Champions League, where they played alongside Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen, and Club Brugge.</p>
<p>Porto’s roster looks amazing, even though there are a couple of players who will miss Wednesday’s game – Evanilson, Gabriel Veron, Otavio, Wendell. Nevertheless, this team has a very long bench, with plenty of up-and-coming players determined to show their worth on the big stage.</p>
<p>Inter Milan vs Porto Prediction</p>
<p>Porto is a team that doesn’t fear anyone. These guys know only to attack and that’s what we expect to see from them on Wednesday. Unfortunately for them, so do the boys playing for Inter Milan. They know how to attack, especially when their fans are cheering them on from the stands of San Siro. That said, even though we expect an entertaining duel, we do think the hosts will win.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Milan to win and over 2.5 goals</p>
