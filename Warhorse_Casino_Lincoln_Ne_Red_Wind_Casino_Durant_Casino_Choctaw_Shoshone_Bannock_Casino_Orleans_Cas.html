<p>ESA Gaming, a boutique developer of iGaming products and online casino games, has grown its aggregation solution by adding a 60th supplier to its list in the face of Wazdan, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>Wazdan, a distinguished and highly successful iGaming developer in its own right, will now be a member of the Games Aggregation System (GAS) pioneered by ESA Gaming and featuring dozens of prominent brands.</p>
<p>Moving forward, ESA Gaming partners will benefit from access to such Wazdan top-performing titles as 9 Coins, Hot Slot, Power of Gods, Sizzling Eggs Extremely Light, and so much more. GAS will essentially have access to the studio’s marketing and engagement tools, which include features such as Cash Infinity and Collect to Infinity, but also Mystery Drop.</p>
<p>All of these have been created by Wazdan’s skilled development team after careful market analysis allowing the supplier, and now ESA Gaming, to benefit from current iGaming trends and ensure that they have a firm grasp on what is loved by players.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming Head of Marketing Thomas Smallwood has hailed this opportunity and celebrated the milestone of adding Wazdan as the company’s 60th GAS partner. "With its strong array of games content that combines classic slot experiences with bold video slots, we’re certain our customers will appreciate its new additions to our portfolio," Smallwood said confident about the future.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming has been building quite the product proposition, owing not least to its highly innovative HTML5 mobile-first technology, EasySwipe. EasySwipe has become an immediate hit as the portfolio features ultra-lightweight games that are easy to deploy and run on nominal infrastructure, allowing ESA Gaming to penetrate markets that have previously presented logistical challenges.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Wazdan's Head of Sales and Business Development for Balkan and Southeast Europe, Radka Bacheva, said that the GAS solution is a great way for Wazdan to further expand its reach of titles and punch an even more powerful impact on iGaming markets.</p>
<p>"It is an exciting time for both companies, and we look forward to driving each other to new heights with this integration," Bacheva assured. Wazdan has been building up its portfolio not only through aggregators, but also through individual linkups.</p>
<p>Recently, the company partnered up with Lottomatica and GoldBet.it, boosting its Italian presence significantly.</p>
