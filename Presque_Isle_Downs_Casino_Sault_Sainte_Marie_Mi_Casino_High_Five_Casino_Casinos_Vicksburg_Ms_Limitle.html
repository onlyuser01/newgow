<p>Sunday’s Kansas City vs Cincinnati game is a rematch of last season’s AFC Championship game. The Bengals won the conference last year, can they do it again</p>
<p>With Joe Burrow as their QB, the Bengals have all wins against the Chiefs (3-0). One of those wins happened in last season’s NFC Championship game, in which Cincinnati won 27-24 after overtime.</p>
<p>A year later, the Chiefs are plotting revenge. Online bookmakers believe they’re going to make their plan come alive, but there’s one thing that needs to worry them – their key player QB Patrick Mahomes is struggling with a high-ankle sprain.</p>

<p>The Bengals Just Love Playing Big Games</p>
<p>The Cincinnati Bengals are a team that always seems to show up when playing against tough opponents. They went 12-4 in the regular season, with wins against such heavyweights as The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cleveland Browns, and even the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>After earning the No. 3 seed in the AFC, they got to play the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card game. The Bengals defense did great in that game, even forcing a turnover in the key moment, helping the team win 24-17.</p>
<p>Next came the Divisional Round game against the Buffalo Bills, who were the main Super Bowl favorites before the clash. The Bengals came to snowy Buffalo as six-point underdogs but ended up destroying the Bills 27-10. Once again, their defense was brilliant – they kept Buffalo’s QB Josh Allen to zero touchdowns – it was only the third time it happened in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>The Bengals offense also did great that day, with Joe Burrow going 23-36 for 242 yards and two touchdowns – caught by Ja’Marr Chase and Hayden Hurst. Their third TD of the game was the work of running back Joe Mixon.</p>
<p>All Eyes on Patrick Mahomes</p>
<p>After finishing top in the AFC with a 14-3 record, the Kansas City Chiefs’ first postseason game was in the Divisional Round. They played against one of the biggest overachievers of the 2022-23 season – the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>After going 22 years without a playoff win and a 45 year span with only 3 playoff wins, Kansas City has won 9 playoff games over the last 4 years. 5 straight AFC Title Games. Patrick Mahomes has more playoff wins than every other past Chiefs QB combined. #ChiefsKingdom @KCTV5 pic.twitter.com/LQTpiXbFxC — Jared Koller (@JaredKCTV5) January 22, 2023</p>
<p>The game went as expected, with the Chiefs winning 27-20. However, the Chiefs fans did get a scare at one point in the first half when Jacksonville’s pass rusher Arden Key fell on Patrick Mahomes’ ankle. The QB didn’t let this stop him from giving his utmost on the pitch, but it was later revealed that he suffered a high-ankle sprain.</p>
<p>It’s not a serious injury and Mahomes has vowed he’ll play in the AFC Championship game. However, the question is whether the injury will affect his performance. Knowing that he’s by far their crucial player, Mahomes not being at 100% fitness could mean problems for the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Cincinnati Bengals vs Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>The Bengals defense will try to bully Mahomes on Sunday; can his teammates provide him with enough protection? We think this is something that can decide the AFL Championship.</p>
<p>So far, the Bengals have shown they know how to play against great offensive teams. Still, this doesn’t mean they will be able to do it again. After all, there’s so much at stake in this game – the Chiefs are playing in front of their fans who demand revenge.</p>
<p>That said, we think Kansas City will win the AFC Championship, but this is going to be one very, very close game. In fact, we wouldn’t be surprised if this game went overtime.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs to win; under to hit</p>
