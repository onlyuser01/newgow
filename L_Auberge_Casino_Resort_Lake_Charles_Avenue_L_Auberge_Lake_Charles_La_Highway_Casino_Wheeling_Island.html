<p>Artificial intelligence esports data company Rival.ai has been acquired by Wondr Gaming, a fund created with the sole purpose of building a strong portfolio of esports assets that complement each other.</p>
<p>Rival.ai Becomes Wondr Gaming Brand</p>
<p>Esports investment fund Wondr Gaming has concluded the acquisition of Rival.ai, an artificial intelligence esports platform.</p>
<p>Rival.ai is focused on providing comprehensive esports data during live games, offering opportunities to esports fans to place wagers according to AI algorithms.</p>
<p>Created by Mike Cotton and Jon Dwyer, the Wondr Gaming fund is looking to acquire valuable assets in the esports segment.</p>
<p>Commenting on the developments, Cotton had this to say:</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to have completed our first transaction and are actively in discussions with multiple companies for our next acquisition”</p>
<p>He further added that Wondr Gaming was focused on collaborating with multiple teams and products, and pushing various companies by finding synergies and complementing their offers.</p>
<p>A Strategic Development for Rival.ai</p>
<p>The acquisition of Rival is strategic as it allows Wondr Gaming to focus on betting entities, the executives specified.</p>
<p>While financial details have not been disclosed, Rival.ai will operate under the Wondr Gaming brand, without any internal shifts in management.</p>
<p>Bryan Yale and James Mifsud will continue in their roles of chief operating officer and chief executive respectively.</p>
<p>Misfud added that acquiring Rival.ai allowed Wondr Gaming to support an industry the team truly loved. He went on to say:</p>
<p>“With this, we will become a leading data provider supporting betting platforms and further developing our core services. We are excited to take our technology to the next level.”</p>
<p>Esports Betting: A New Frontier</p>
<p>With the key source of revenue from esports coming from sponsorships with big brands, esports betting is proving to be another lucrative market.</p>
<p>According to one estimate, esports is the largest and most underappreciated segment to date so far as competitive video games go.</p>
<p>However, no accurate survey has been conducted to fully represent the actual value of the market.</p>
<p>Before, Valve got embroiled with a lawsuit where plaintiff argued the company had been facilitating underage gambling through skins – cosmetic items available in Valve games, such as Counter-Strike and Dota 2, among other titles in esports – the ‘skin betting market’ was on track to hit $12 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>However, the sudden legal focus on the issue prompted Valve to quickly suspend all trading platforms offering such services.</p>
<p>As a result, skin trading websites are illegal and generally mistrusted. While the exact value of esports betting is not entirely clear, esports as a whole is going to exceed $1 billion in 2019, Newzoo has reported.</p>
<p>Endemic and Non-Endemic Sportsbooks</p>
<p>In the United States, Unikrn received a license to operate esports betting markets. The platform is one of the so-called endemic sportsbooks, focusing entirely on esports. Similar platforms include Lockbox and Rivalry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are companies, such as Pinnacle and William Hill, referred to as non-endemic, to offer a mix of traditional sports competitions – which is their staple – and competitive video gaming.</p>
