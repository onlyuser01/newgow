<p>A few months after announcing the creation of Ireland’s first regulator, the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland, the country selected a CEO to head the body. The one up to the task is Anne Marie Caulfield, who will be responsible for overseeing the reforms of Ireland’s gambling laws.</p>
<p>Caulfield Named CEO of the Irish Regulator</p>
<p>Ireland has been trying to reform its gambling laws for a decade now. However, this time, the country is serious about it and has already taken steps towards this goal. Ireland began assembling a regulatory team and is set to begin reforming the industry starting next year. To that end, the regulator will have the power to enforce certain regulations and set gambling safety requirements that operators must follow. The Irish government hopes that the regulator will be ready to begin work in 2023.</p>
<p>Ahead of the reforms, the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland welcomed Anne Marie Caulfield as its first chief executive officer. She is notably the ex-director of the Residential Tenancies Board and has held other positions in the country’s civil service.</p>
<p>As CEO of the upcoming regulator, Caulfield will be responsible for imposing the reformed Irish gaming laws and helping the country better protect its vulnerable communities from gambling harm. The Gambling Regulatory Authority will be authorized to fine non-compliant operators and impose other sanctions for various regulation breaches.</p>
<p>Operators Are Happy with the Choice</p>
<p>Junior Justice Minister James Browne, who proposed the upcoming reforms, announced Caulfield’s appointment and added that the new legislation will likely be published this fall. The early appointment of a CEO of the regulatory body will help to minimize the time between the introduction of new laws and the official launch of the Gambling Regulatory Authority.</p>
<p>Speaking on the matter, Browne said that the Irish gambling industry currently leaves a lot to be desired. Because of that, he considers it a personal responsibility to help usher in new laws that govern the gambling sector and protect at-risk gamblers from harm. Browne noted that the introduction of new regulations is very important not only for the prevention of gambling harm but for modernizing the licensing and regulatory processes as well.</p>
<p>Gambling operators, meanwhile, welcomed Caulfield as CEO of the upcoming regulatory body. Paddy Power’s chief executive, Conor Grant, said that her appointment attests to the government’s progress toward the establishment of an authority that can keep up with the industry. Sharon Bryne, chair of the Irish Bookmakers’ Association, called Caulfield’s appointment “a major milestone in the development of the regulation of the sector.”</p>
