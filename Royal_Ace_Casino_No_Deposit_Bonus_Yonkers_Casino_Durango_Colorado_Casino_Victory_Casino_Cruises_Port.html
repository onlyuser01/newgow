<p>The provider of slots, video bingo and iGaming solutions and content, Zitro, confirmed it expanded its European workforce to meet the increasing demand for its products. On Monday, the company said that its European sales workforce received a boost with three strategic additions.</p>
<p>Zitro revealed that Krystian Konopka was promoted to the role of Sales Manager. As one of the company's veterans, he has extensive experience and a track record. Now, in his role as Sales Manager, Konopka will be in charge of strategically important markets for the company that include Sweden, Ireland, Poland, as well as Egypt.</p>
<p>Additionally, the expert with international markets, John Morris, will now provide vital support for Zitro's international sales teams. He will provide strategic guidance and contribute toward the development of growth and product strategies. Not unexpectedly, Morris will leverage his experience to ensure that the business remains competitive and at the same time expands to new markets.</p>
<p>Strengthening further its C-suite, Zitro confirmed that it has appointed Andreas Leitinger to the role of Sales Manager. In his new leadership role, he will be based in Slovenia. Leitinger's responsibilities will include strategic European markets such as Slovenia, Luxembourg and Germany, among other jurisdictions that are important for the company. Thanks to his extensive experience, he will provide strategic guidance and help Zitro expand further its footprint within the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Led by Nad√®ge Teyssedre, Zitro's EMEA Sales Director, the company has seen its leadership team expand by bringing in seasoned veterans with rich industry experience. Sharing her excitement about the recent appointments, Teyssedre said in a statement: "We are proud to have John, Andreas, and Krystian on board as part of our growing team." Finally, she outlined: "With their experience and expertise, we see tremendous potential for further growth and expansion in the European gaming market."</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes on the heels of an important deal announced by Zitro. Earlier this month, the company confirmed it joined forces with Vicca Group, expanding its reach within the Colombian market. Under the terms of the partnership, Zitro agreed to supply its games for multiple properties of the operator. This partnership helped expand further the reach of the company's content, while at the same time strengthening Vicca Group's presence in the region.</p>
<p>Before that, Zitro forged a deal with Sportium Colombia. Thanks to that collaboration, the company's online division, Zitro Digital, agreed to supply games for the fast-growing online gambling and sports betting operator.</p>
