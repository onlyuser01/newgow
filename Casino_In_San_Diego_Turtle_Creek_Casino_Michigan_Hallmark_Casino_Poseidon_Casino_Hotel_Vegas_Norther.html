    <h1>Casino In San Diego Turtle Creek Casino Michigan Hallmark Casino Poseidon Casino Hotel Vegas Norther</h1>

<p>On August 3rd, 2020 I made a deposit of € 100 at Caxino.com and won the 100% bonus.</p>
<p>I had both € 100 real money and € 100 bonus money on my account.</p>
<p>I then bought bonus free spins for € 200 in the "Fruit Party" slot and after losing € 100 I bought games for € 100 again. Shortly afterwards, I received a message that I had exceeded the maximum bet. I had read through the bonus conditions beforehand, since the terms and conditions mentioned a maximum bet of € 5, I assumed that it unfortunately refers to the bet of a single "spin" and not also to the purchase of free spins it is also not possible to buy free spins for less than € 20. Because with free spins the single bet is only € 2 if you buy free spins for € 200. So we assumed that it would be allowed to buy free spins up to € 500, since then the individual bet per spin is € 5.</p>
<p>In the terms and conditions of Caxino no syllable is mentioned that the purchase of free spins with bonus money is not allowed (IN EVERY OTHER ONLINE CASINO THIS IS THE CASE).</p>
<p>Caxino only writes something about a maximum bet in the bonus conditions, everyone can interpret this differently, since in other casinos it is allowed to buy free spins despite the maximum bet, since the maximum bet relates to the individual spin.</p>
<p>I made a profit of € 1900 with the free spins purchase, when the message was displayed that the maximum amount had been exceeded, I immediately contacted customer service in the live chat because I didn't want to go wrong.</p>
<p>In the chat I was told without any warning that the entire bonus would have to be confiscated. My account balance was simply reset. So all the money I won was deleted.</p>
<p>Immediately after winning, I reported to the chat and did not continue to play, but the entire profit was withdrawn.</p>
<p>I'm relatively new to Caxino, besides playing at several other online casinos like Premium.com (Bwin), MrGreen, LeoVegas, Wildz, etc.</p>
<p>Everywhere in the bonus terms and conditions there is a reference to the free spins purchase, and that bonuses or other funds are ever confiscated has never happened to me. So my first impression is that Caxino.com is completely dubious and is only waiting for such moments to withhold funds.</p>
<p>I have already written several emails with the request to credit the credit again, unfortunately Caxino is stubborn.</p>
