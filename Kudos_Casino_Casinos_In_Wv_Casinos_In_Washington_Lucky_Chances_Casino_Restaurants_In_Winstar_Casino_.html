    <h1>Kudos Casino Casinos In Wv Casinos In Washington Lucky Chances Casino Restaurants In Winstar Casino</h1>

<p>Hey</p>
<p>So I used bonus code ICYHOT200 which was a 200% No Rules bonus with 13 - 1$ spins with no rollover on Icy Hot. Since it was a no rules bonus I only had to bet my balance 1x to complete my watering requirements. My deposit was 55$ and after using the free spins + 200% my bonus funds were 126.50. So when I submitted the withdraw for 590, I left 126.50 in my account from the bonus that they removed from my account.</p>
<p>Sadly as I have yet to get an email from their support for anything, all of my chats were done in the Live Chat area of the site. I didn't screen shot the conversations and I don't know how to see them again.</p>
<p>Right before this response I again reached out to live chat and explained my frustration and was met with the same generic response about the lengths of the whole withdraw process. I asked if there was a way he could verify that my withdraw was in the queue and he said he couldn't verify but I should receive my payout today or tomorrow. So I will update this thread if anything changes.</p>
