    <h1>Casino Oregon Pechanga Casino Hotel Online Casina Playojo Casino Casinos Near LuckyDreams Casino The</h1>

<p>This casino took everything from me. I’ve only had net losses and the amount is over R70000 which is more or less 3 months salary for me. Even when I threatened I would harm myself due to my enormous amounts of losses, my casino account remained open and they allowed me to gamble out my most recent salary without so much as a word, even giving me bonuses to entice me to gamble further. I have lost everything and they won’t refund my money even though they are at fault for letting me gamble after I showed clear signs of gambling addiction and instability, when I brought it up again on chat a few weeks later they still tried to over me free spins for my losses. This place has no regulatory authority and will take everything from you.</p>
<p>please see chat below:</p>
<p>Brandon, I may offer you a complimentary 20 free spins bonus, to cheer you up a bit.</p>

<p>How is that going to cheer me up when I lost more than R12000 yesterday which is more than 70% of my salary I haven’t even paid my rent or bills or bought food for my family I’ve lost everything here, all I have here is net losses of over R70000 I’ve won nothing, this place has taken everything from me and it won’t give me anything in return, what kind of place is this</p>
<p>I’ve lost my salary more than once here already since joining and my loans I had to take out to survive are not being paid because I keep losing everything here and now I can’t even get anything back how does that work how am I supposed to survive?</p>

<p>I'm really sorry to hear that, Brandon, but we are not responsible for your losses as for your winnings. Gambling is always about the chance and luck. What I can offer you now is 20 free spins, do you want me to add them?</p>

<p>Brandon, I'm really sorry to hear that. I may offer you a bonus for you to try your luck one more time. But I hope you understand that gambling is not the way to earn money. Please don't take it to close, if it makes you suffer, maybe it is better to offer you a deposit limit?</p>
<p>Brandon 13:18</p>
<p>What bonus do you want to offer me because my R70000 or more losses here is more worth than 20 free spins? What bonus will make me be lucky</p>
<p>Oliver 13:26</p>
<p>I'm talking about the bonus I offered you before</p>
