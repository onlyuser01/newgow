<p>Zitro, a world leader in video slots and bingo, has armed yet another casino with its cutting-edge Altius Glare gaming cabinets. The recipient this time is Casino Barrière Montreux, a gambling venue in Montreux, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Zitro’s Altius Glare Cabinets Hit the Swiss Casino</p>
<p>This will notably be the first time Zitro’s last-gen machines have made their way into Switzerland. Although the company has already supplied several venues with such cabinets, this will be the first time Swiss bettors get to enjoy Altius Glare.</p>
<p>Altius Clare machines boast a pristine 55-inch screen, as well as a smaller 27-inch full HD screen. In addition, all cabinets have Wheel of Legends, one of Zitro’s hit titles, installed by default. Overall, Zitro’s Altius Glare cabinets are state-of-the-art gaming machines that have proven to engage casino visitors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the installation of such cabinets boosts Zitro’s presence in Switzerland and allows it to expand its European footprint.</p>
<p>The Casino Is Happy to Add Zitro’s Machines to Its Offer</p>
<p>Jerôme Colin, Casino Barrière Montreux’s director, spoke about the new agreement with Zitro. He mentioned that his team is excited to launch the famed Altius Glare machines at the Montreux gaming venue. He is also happy about the opportunity to expand Casino Barrière Montreux’s portfolio with more products by a reputable gaming supplier such as Zitro.</p>
<p>Colin concluded that he hopes for a long and fruitful partnership that will bring value to both his casino and Zitro.</p>
<p>Nadège Teyssedre, sales director for the EMEA region at Zitro, also voiced his thoughts on the agreement. She said that Zitro’s team is absolutely certain Swiss customers are going to enjoy Altius Glare and everything it has to offer. Teyssedre is sure that the new gaming cabinets will engage casino visitors with exciting gaming experiences and help Casino Barrière Montreux grow its revenues.</p>
<p>According to Teyssedre, the launch of the Altius Glare cabinets in Switzerland is an important step for her company as it seeks to expand its presence in Europe. She concluded that she is happy to see the machines go live at the prestigious Swiss casino and can’t wait to entertain its visitors. Teyssedre concluded that this partnership is a welcome one as it helps Zitro boost its footprint in Switzerland.</p>
<p>On a separate note, Zitro recently launched the same cabinets at Badajoz Casino, a notable Spanish gambling venue. Earlier this year, the supplier also powered Casino Colón, another Spanish casino, with its Double Link games.</p>
