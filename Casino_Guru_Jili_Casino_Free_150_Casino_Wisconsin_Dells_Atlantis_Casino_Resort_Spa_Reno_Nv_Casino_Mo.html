<p>A new collaboration sees betPARX relaunch its sports betting and iGaming app in Pennsylvania and New Jersey powered by technology from Playtech</p>
<p>The world’s leading gambling technology company, Playtech, announced it joined forces with betPARX for the relaunch of its sports betting and iGaming app in two US states, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Thanks to the recent relaunch, the betPARX app in the two states is now powered by Playtech’s innovative IMS platform and Player Account Management (PAM) system.</p>
<p>While the collaboration helps strengthen betPARX’s offering in the two states, it also helps expand the reach of Playtech’s leading technology. In fact, the collaboration represents the debut of the IMS technology for Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
<p>The improved application enables customers in the two states to access iGaming and sports betting products, powered by state-of-the-art technology from Playtech. Ultimately, the relaunched app delivers elevated online gambling experiences and helps solidify Playtech’s position as a leading supplier of technology for the betting and gaming sector.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration builds upon a strong foundation, considering that Parx Casino, the largest casino in Pennsylvania, joined forces with Playtech back in February 2021. That deal made Parx the first US operator to introduce Playtech’s leading IMS iGaming platform. Playtech also teamed up with betPARX and Gun Lake Casino for the launch of a new iGaming app in Michigan called Play Gun Lake.</p>
<p>The IMS platform has already gained popularity across the globe, powering some of the most popular operators within the gambling sector. Currently, Playtech is renowned for its technology and is one of the most successful business-to-business operators outside of the US market. The company constantly grows its presence and the latest launch comes after it secured a Gaming Manufacturer License from the gambling regulator in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. To date, Playtech has established its presence in three US states.</p>
<p>Sports Bettors and Casino Players to Benefit from Thrilling Experiences</p>
<p>Matthew Cullen, betPARX’s SVP of iGaming and sports, said that the company is delighted to see the launch of the betPARX app, powered by leading technology from Playtech. “We’ve made the sign-up and deposit and cash-out processes as simple and smooth as anything in the industry,” he added. Finally, Cullen invited everyone to experience the betPARX app and said that it delivers unique and engaging experiences for sports bettors and casino players alike.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to continue to grow Playtech’s iGaming and sports betting partnership with betPARX in other US markets.“ Mor Weizer, CEO at Playtech</p>
<p>Playtech’s CEO, Mor Weizer, added that the company is excited to continue to expand its presence within the sports betting and iGaming vertical thanks to the collaboration with betPARX. He praised Playtech’s software that delivers exceptional customer experiences which are highly sought-after within the gambling sector in the US. Finally, Weizer said that Playtech seeks to grow further its footprint and collaborate with betPARX in other states.</p>
