<p>Michael Rubin, the chief executive officer of Fanatics seems to be very ambitious about his company’s sports betting launch. He said he hopes to see Fanatics live in at least 15 states by the next NFL season.</p>
<p>Rubin Is Ambitious about the Launch</p>
<p>Rubin announced his plans to launch a sports betting business during the CAA World Congress of Sports. According to him, the new division should go live as soon as January next year. This period isn’t randomly picked either as it coincides with the highly-anticipated National Football League playoffs, which will help jumpstart the sports betting business.</p>
<p>Going forward, Fanatics hopes to quickly roll out its sports betting offerings in other states. The company will seek licenses for every major state, with the exception of New York, Rubin revealed. The company wants to have a presence in between 15 and 20 states by the launch of the next NFL season.</p>
<p>Rubin spoke on the launch and the company’s decision to not target New York:</p>
<p>We’ll be in every major state other than New York, where you can’t make money. We do like to make money, by the way. It’s this crazy concept in business — where we have revenue, we try to have profits that follow it. Michael Rubin, CEO, Fanatics</p>
<p>Fanatics Is Poised to Grow as a Betting Company</p>
<p>Fanatics is the ultimate one-stop sports fan destination. For years, the company has been engaging fans of pro sports with relevant sports content. Now, the company plans to take this one step further and capitalize on the growth of sports betting in the US.</p>
<p>The company’s goal, as a whole, is to change the way fans connect with their favorite teams and players by providing enthusiasts with content and merchandise. Fanatics is now a full-scale global digital sports platform and is well-positioned to make a foray into the world of sports betting.</p>
<p>Fanatics’ brand recognition will likely allow it to quickly find its way around the world of sports betting. Furthermore, the company has existing partnerships with many teams that will facilitate the launches of retail sportsbooks at their home stadiums.</p>
<p>Rubin forecasts lower customer acquisition expenditure for Fanatics as he remains certain that the company’s fanbase will help it to quickly grow and distinguish itself from its competition.</p>
<p>In August, Fanatics appointed Andrew Kleiman, a former FanDuel worker, as VP of retail. The appointment demonstrated that the company is quickly preparing for the rollout of its sports betting offering.</p>
