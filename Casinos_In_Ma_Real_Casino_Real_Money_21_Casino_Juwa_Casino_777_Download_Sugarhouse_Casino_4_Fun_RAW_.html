<p>RAW Arena has been able to end the year with a trio of partnerships. Announced last week, RAW Arena secured new alliances with Infiniza, NetBet, and FullForce with the companies looking forward to a mutually beneficial arrangement in 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>RAW Arena offers a quick single-point integration and round-up of innovative slot games which will be provided across a number of brands, the company said in a press release shared via email.</p>
<p>In detailing the partners for the company, RAW Arena confirmed that OmniSlots, Fruits4Real, Casino777, Spinnalot, WestPointCasino, and Spinero will all be able to bring to their player bases an excellent variety of titles.</p>
<p>RAW CEO Tom Woods has welcomed the deal and said that the company was determined to significantly increase the number of casino operators it’s teaming up with. A big focus is placed on the Netherlands and Belgium, he added.</p>
<p>"It’s great to see operators such as Infiniza, NetBet, and FullForce be able to deliver a differentiated experience to their players via RAW Arena," Woods added. He further said that the RAW team had what it takes to help operators break away from traditional gameplay and help elevate the overall player offering.</p>
<p>Infiniza’s Sarah Fox was similarly pleased with the deal and argued that RAW Arena would truly help the operator and its brands stand out from other brands. There is much that RAW has to bring, including bespoke themes, gameplay, and mechanics that give casinos a significant leg-up in an already competitive market.</p>
<p>RAW will indeed be rolling out a number of its most recent and popular games, including Popeye vsBrutus SuperSlice, Blackbeard’s SuperSlice Rings, and many others. RAW has vowed to continue bringing innovation to the iGaming sector on all levels, working around the clock to create more immersive experiences.</p>
<p>RAW Arena seems to be moving in three’s after the platform previously announced in December that it signed a similar partnership with PAF.com, OlyBet.com, Twin.com. Content aggregators are becoming increasingly important to the iGaming industry. What RAW Arena tries to get better, however, is to ensure that its content stands out by virtue of its gameplay and mechanics.</p>
