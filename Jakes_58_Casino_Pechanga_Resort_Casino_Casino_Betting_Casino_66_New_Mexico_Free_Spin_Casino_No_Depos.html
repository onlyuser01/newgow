<p>The Egyptian-Themed Slot Expands Further Wizard Games’ Offering</p>
<p>Simon Jagdhar, Wizard Games’ director of games studio, explained that the “Book of” series has proven to be popular within the gambling vertical. He added that the studio is excited to expand further its collection by introducing the new Egyptian-themed Book of Eternal Romance slot game.</p>
<p>“‘Book of’ is a popular genre that is universally enjoyed across the industry, and we’re delighted to launch Book of Eternal Romance, this time incorporating an Egyptian theme.“ Simon Jagdhar, director of games studio at Wizard Games</p>
<p>Jagdhar spoke about the engaging and rewarding features the new game offers. Finally, he predicted that Book of Eternal Romance will be well-received by slots fans and pointed out that they will be surprised by the engaging features it offers.</p>
<p>The release of the new slot further boosts Wizard Games’ growing portfolio of content. It comes on the heels of the recently released slot The Funky Boombox and enhances a collection of games that by now surpasses 130 titles.</p>
<p>Players Can Benefit from Multipliers, Free Spins</p>
<p>During the base play of the slot game, the players can randomly trigger a feature called Eternal Romance. It opens an ancient book and spins a reel, showing a multiplier wheel. Once the reel stops on a specific multiplier, it is applied for the next spin, granting the possibility for significant payouts.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Book of Eternal Romance features Free Spins. Hitting three Scatter symbols opens the ancient book, giving the player a chance to select a special symbol. “Every fourth Scatter collected will unlock the next level of the feature, which awards three additional spins and the wheel with increased multiplier pay on the special symbol,” explained the game developer. Overall, there are four levels that can be unlocked, which can result in a win of up to 2,500x of the player’s bet.</p>
