    <h1>The Golden Nugget Casino Casino With Slot Machines Near Me Pennsylvania Online Casino Aria Hotel Cas</h1>

<p>BC Games has no honesty, integrity or any form of cohesion to transparency. It has a fair selection of games to peak your interest, but their live support and hosting service hold no strength, bar to reply with copy and paste or ignore you. I hold a badge for staking over $1m dollars over a year, so I am well aware of how they operate. They claim to be provably fair, but thatâ€™s rather impossible given the high volatility of crypto currency which is the method of deposit and withdrawal. Their explanation of it on the site is pure economic waffle. As an economist itâ€™s pretty easy to read that in to this. I have 3 issue on which they refuse to pay me money; 2 of which I will provide upon request.</p>
<p>The bc game server told my server that I had won 6.734826011 in crash. BC games claim that the game had crashed when I cashed out. They asked for a screenshot which I duly sent, and they refused to accept it. Iâ€™ve sent the screenshot in uploads.They then requested a video ðŸ˜†.</p>
<p>Another incident involving a 9 dot win exhibited exactly the same scenario. Again, they would not pay out. Crash will often come up with "you failed to cash out on time " when you do cash out , and then the game will crash. It also often mysteriously changes from one crash game to another. The amount it claims people are gambling upon that specific game every say 30 seconds, is virtually impossible. $18,000 on average. Considering all of the other games in operation it should be showing a turnover of billions of dollars per annum. I donâ€™t think it is so. It would be very surprising for them to provide such empirical evidence.</p>
<p>The next win they refuse to pay out on is greatest catch. I paid $13.70 to move in to the 10cent 20 free spin feature. As each spin wins or loses, the win increases the total dollar amount on the bottom left of the screen. As I have the screenshots attached to this complaint ,it is showing that this did not happen, and when the game was over I made a profit of which I have the screenshots showing them the game is of me making a profit. They refuse to pay out.</p>
<p>In total they owe me 15.7 dot. Valued at $8.6896 on crypto.com 11.21 a.m 28/12/23 European time. Plus $41.45 on 22/12/2023 at 10.10:29 UTC time.</p>
<p>They tried to refer me to Kraken claiming to have paid out with a taxid code. I have in my possession a reply from Kraken proving they were lying.(attached)</p>
<p>So take your chance with bc.games if you wish. Iâ€™ve just shown they are not provably fair and owe me $136.32 dollars in Polkadot and $41.45 from the greatest catch game. Total owed $177.77 at 11 am U.K. time on 28/12/2023.</p>
