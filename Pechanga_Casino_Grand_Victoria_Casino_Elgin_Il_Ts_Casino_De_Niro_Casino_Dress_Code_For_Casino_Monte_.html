    <h1>Pechanga Casino Grand Victoria Casino Elgin Il Ts Casino De Niro Casino Dress Code For Casino Monte</h1>

<p>Exactly 364 days after suffering a bizarre knee injury, Tom Aspinall is coming back to The O2 Arena in London to fight in a UFC main event. This time, the event in question is UFC Fight Night: Aspinall vs. Tybura, taking place on Saturday, July 22, 2023</p>
<p>Tom Aspinall’s brilliant UFC run of five straight wins with four Performance of the Night bonuses ended last year after he suffered a knee injury only 15 seconds into the fight with Curtis Blaydes. Almost exactly one year after, the Englishman has a chance to get back onto the winning track.</p>
<p>He’ll have his fans to support him in London, but beating Marcin Tybura won’t be easy as the Polish fighter is famous for being someone who never backs down.</p>

<p>Tom Aspinall Ready to Get Back in the Spotlight</p>
<p>He’s one of the best heavyweights on the planet, there’s no arguing about that. Tom Aspinall’s overall record is 12-3, although one of those three losses was the TKO one in the Blaydes fight, in which he practically injured himself.</p>

<p>When it comes to his wins, all of them happened inside the distance. Nine times he won by a KO/TKO, and three times by a submission. What’s also very interesting is that this guy’s never spent more than 9 minutes inside the cage in his professional career.</p>
<p>But there’s a first for everything; maybe that will change this Saturday in London?</p>
<p>Can Marcin Tybura Stage an Upset at The O2?</p>
<p>Marcin Tybura is a jack of all trades, whose strongest weapon is his resilience. This guy is tough as nails, the evidence being that he’s 7-1 in his last eight fights in which he’s fought some real nasty opponents. In his most recent fight, he defeated Blagoy Ivanov by a unanimous decision, while in the fight before that, he won against Alexander Romanov by a majority decision.</p>
<p>He’s 24-7 overall with four losses inside the distance, each of which was by a KO/TKO. The last time it happened was almost four years ago when Augusto Sakai KO-ed him. But it was back when Sakai was in his prime. In fact, the Brazilian came into the Tybura fight after a win over Andrei Arlovski.</p>
<p>Tom Aspinall vs. Marcin Tybura Prediction</p>
<p>If you compare Aspinall with Tybura, he’s better in every single aspect of MMA fighting, including fitness. Sure, he’s coming off a hiatus, but It’s been almost a year since his knee injury, so Aspinall should be fine by now. Backed by his fans at The O2 Arena, Aspinall will probably go for another stoppage win.</p>
<p>Pick: Tom Aspinall to win</p>
