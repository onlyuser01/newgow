    <h1>Caesars Windsor Hotel Casino Sweep Slots Casino Login Akwesasne Hotel And Casino Hayward Casino Red</h1>

<p>I submitted a withdrawal request, which was confirmed received by Silveredge Casino on June 9th. The next week Silveredge Casino was no longer operational in my jurisdiction , and I could no longer access account . I was informed my account is transferred to Newfunclub.</p>
<p>I have since followed up</p>
<p>numerous times with both Casinos but have not received any specific information back regarding my withdrawal request. Attached are copies of some related correspondence from casino.</p>
<p>The only communication Iâ€™ve received recently is an automated generic message indicating balances from Silveredge accounts should be available "shortly" in newfunclub.</p>
<p>I still have no information as to whether my withdrawal was approved or even any acknowledgment from newfunclub that they are processing it.</p>
