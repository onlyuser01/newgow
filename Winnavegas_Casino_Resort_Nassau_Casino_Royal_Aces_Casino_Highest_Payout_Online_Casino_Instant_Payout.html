    <h1>Winnavegas Casino Resort Nassau Casino Royal Aces Casino Highest Payout Online Casino Instant Payout</h1>

<p>Interwetten.com</p>
<p>I don't know if this is specifically the casino described in the thread.</p>
<p>My story about Interwetten.</p>
<p>I used to play almost exclusively on this platform - I just thought it was good. At some point, I've been playing WIld Swarm for years. And anyone who knows this game knows that you have to do quite a long time and a lot of spins to reach MAX lvl (lvl5). The special thing is that if you manage it, you can trigger the swarm with every bee that flies into the hive - that means 10 free spins with lots of wilds.</p>
<p>I reached it at some point, I think I played with a stake of 1 or 2 euros because I had over 1000 euros in my account. The normal average to trigger the hive is around 25-35 bees at level 5. It can be a little less or occasionally more.</p>
<p>For me it was like this, I had already collected over 60 bees and nothing happened - my account was getting smaller and smaller - until I noticed something. That every now and then when a bee flew in, the hive wobbled and suddenly broke off completely - an unfinished animation. I knew the game, so I knew what happened when the beehive shook violently and what the animation looked like - either the beehive broke and the swarm was triggered, or the beehive calmed down again and nothing happened.</p>
<p>At some point a few bees later and a few broken animations I was down to around 200 euros. I then wrote to support and asked them to look into it because what was going on was not normal. A short time later the manager contacted me and wrote to me - they found the error, an update was made - you will receive 50 euros in game credit as compensation. Friendly as I am, I then said that it was a joke - I use thousands of spins to reach this level, lose around 1000 euros because there is a mistake in the system - and you want to fob me off with 50 euros? Then I read the rule - if there is a mistake in the system, the casino is not liable for it, you were just unlucky. Then I said - strange if I win a large sum due to a mistake in the game, then you weren't that unlucky, but also me? Where is fair play here please?</p>
<p>Basically it's now - when I try to log in with my details - email address - it doesn't find it. But when I try to register if I'm really no longer in the system, it says - this user is already registered.</p>
<p>When I write to support about this, I don't get an answer.</p>
<p>Respect^^</p>
