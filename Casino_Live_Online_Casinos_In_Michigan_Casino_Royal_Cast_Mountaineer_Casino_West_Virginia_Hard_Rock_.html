<p>Greentube continues to dole out love on its mobile esports experience, Ski Challenge, a game that has been reimagined by the NOVOMATIC’s Digital Gaming and Entertainment division, to feature a set of new improvements that will further elevate the experience for participants.</p>
<p>The original Ski Challenge game was released back in 1998 and was in fact the first game by the company, Greentube reminded in a press release. Now, Ski Challenge is getting a further overhaul to keep up with the demand and expectations from players.</p>
<p>The new updates have to do with the way players interact with the game. For one, there is a new ranking system along with in-game leaderboards and more customization options to make the experience even more worthwhile.</p>
<p>Moving forward, players will be able to collect various skill points by participating in races and unlock new statuses within the game’s ecosystem, listed as Bronze, Silver, Gold, and not least – Master. There are also time-based leaderboards to give players an added incentive to compete.</p>
<p>Ski Challenge is also implementing changes that will allow consumers to further boost the way their profiles look through new clothes, accessors, and avatars. More items will now be added moving forward to continue improving the competitive spirit of Ski Challenge, the company said.</p>
<p>Greentube CFO Michael Bauer welcomed the opportunity to introduce these new changes to Ski Challenge and help the product garner an even more prominent status with its players while catering to demand.</p>
<p>"This trio of exciting updates adds an entirely new layer to the game that we are confident players will welcome and enjoy," Bauer explained optimistically about the future of the game. Ski Challenge was developed as a collaboration with the German Ski Federation, Swiss-Ski, and the Austrian Ski Federation. The game is designed as an Android and iOS solution for mobile gamers.</p>
<p>On the back of its latest successes in esports, Greentube has been similarly keeping a strong momentum in North America where the company has been looking to bring its traditional online casino content. There have been several milestones for the company during the past year, including the acquisition of Present Creative.</p>
<p>Greentube also launched its product portfolio in Michigan through a partnership deal with BetMGM. Not least, Greentube also struck a content alliance with Entain in Ontario.</p>
