    <h1>San Tan Mountain Casino Hollywood Casino St Louis Casino Elk Grove Casino Cocktail Casino Ny BetMGM</h1>

<p>One of the biggest poker tournaments, the BetMGM poker Championship, will be back in Las Vegas on June 9 this year</p>
<p>The event is hailed as one of the biggest and most entertaining ones in the poker circuit with the No Limit Hold’em Tournament carrying a $2 million prize pool and $3,500 buy-in. The BetMGM Poker Championship will run from Friday, June 9 through Tuesday, June 13 and be hosted out of ARIA’s Poker Room in The Strip property.</p>
<p>More Poker Action at the ARIA in Las Vegas</p>
<p>This will give fans several days of tight poker action to enjoy. The event will be live-streamed by PokerGO Studio to ensure that fans will get to share in the event regardless of their geography. The first warm-up event will in fact kick off on June 8 with a Mystery Bounty, the company said in a press statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there will be at least 100 qualifiers hosted by BetMGM Poker in regulated markets, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan in the United States and Ontario in Canada. Online qualifiers will get underway on Monday, May 1. Commenting on this fresh opportunity, BetMGM director of poker Luke Staudenmaier said that the company was pleased to return to the ARIA for a second straight year. He said:</p>
<p>ARIA is delivering a Championship event and we are happy to continue to build on our relationship with MGM Resorts, while connecting BetMGM online players to the best poker rooms in the United States. BetMGM director of poker Luke Staudenmaier</p>
<p>Great Buy-in and Accommodation Packages from Online Qualifiers</p>
<p>Players who choose to participate in the online qualifiers will have the chance to win a straight-out $3,500 buy-in or an $800 buy-in for the Mystery Bounty event. There is also an all-expenses covered package for a six-night ARIA stay between June 7 and June 13, 2023, for those who manage to win at the online qualifiers.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts director of poker strategy Sean McCormack was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see this event take place yet again. ARIA has doubled the prize guarantee to $2 million this year, which should lead to a fairly big turnout.</p>
<p>“Partnering with BetMGM for another summer championship is a tremendous opportunity for us to offer poker players a one-of-a-kind experience,” McCormack explained. BetMGM has in the meantime stressed that it remains committed to responsible gambling and that it would continue to support vulnerable individuals through its GameSense program, promoting safe and responsible gambling practices.</p>
