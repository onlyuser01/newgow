<p>Paddy Power announced a move that will see its betting shops feature digital betting shop displays under an extended deal between Flutter Entertainment and BoscaSports.</p>
<p>Digital Betting Display</p>
<p>The expanded agreement between Paddy Power owner and the provider of industry-leading display technology and retail betting platform BoscaSports will transform more than 40 Paddy Power-branded betting shops in the UK and Ireland by the end of the year by introducing BoscaSports’ digital displays.</p>
<p>“We will be introducing BoscaSport’s digital offering in some new shops and those that are being refitted or retro-fitted throughout the year. The shops, which include Manchester’s Piccadilly Plaza, Leeds City Centre and Hammersmith will feature a mix of BoscaSport’s upgraded passive screens and new interactive screens.” Simon Charnock, Director, Product, Flutter Entertainment UK and Ireland</p>
<p>The move towards more digitization comes just as the retail betting sector in the UK and Ireland is starting to recover from the long period of restrictions during which most of the bettors became accustomed to features offered by online betting platforms.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to be undertaking such a significant further deployment with Paddy Power. They have always led the market in innovation, and this is another example of that. We are looking forward to further developing our product offering with such a forward-thinking operator.” Fergal Downey, Founder and Product Director, BoscaSports</p>
<p>Provider of digital display technology BoscaSports has already established itself as the leader in integrated sports display solutions to retail betting outlets and racecourses, having transformed the LBO and Tote marketplaces with its cutting-edge technology and real-time content across more than 5,000 Tote screens at most of the racecourses in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>Deployed at Paddy Power-branded betting shops, BoscaSports’ screens will deliver live information and Paddy Power pricing on all key sporting events during the day to keep bettors informed and engaged with the action from the events.</p>
<p>Featuring BoscaSports Interactive</p>
<p>Ben Dowding, director of betting at Racecourse Media Group outlined that “digital betting shop display” as “just one of the key areas” encompassed by the collaboration between the group and Flutter Entertainment which began in late 2021.</p>
<p>Dowding, who is also serving as director at BoscaSports, expressed his content at the “further deployment of BoscaSports’ product” across Paddy Power retail shops slated to happen throughout the year, including the company’s new BoscaSports Interactive product.</p>
<p>The deal expansion will place Paddy Power betting shops among the first to feature BoscaSports’ touch-screen solution BoscaSports Interactive which offers bettors access to a string of digital tools, segmented by price, stats, markets, tipsters, and other criteria, tools that were previously available only online.</p>
