    <h1>Casino Hotels In Oklahoma Nj Party Casino Planet Hollywood Resort And Casino Las Vegas Reviews Brand</h1>

<p>I have been claiming withdrawals at this casino for 15 days. The first by card that I deposited Mastercard on 10/10/2022 was denied 10 days later. The second by card requested on 10/18/2022 has been denied today 10/25/2022. I request withdrawal by bank account (3 during the day today), and they are approved and denied after a few minutes.</p>
<p>I have contacted by chat and email (most do not respond), and requested a phone call that I never received. First they told me that everything was correct and to wait 5 days. After that time they began to excuse themselves by commenting that the payment provider adyen is failing in payments to Spain, without providing any solution. No dates, no nothing.</p>
<p>Today I contact to try to pay by bank transfer, the operator tells me that everything is fine, then if I want to block my account to what I do not access, and after that they are not to blame for anything that is the fault of the provider, that their company is in Malta, to check with my bank, which is absurd.</p>
<p>This operator has the nerve to tell me to deposit money through paypal and try to withdraw there. All this after sending and verifying documentation from my bank, card, receipts, ridiculous.</p>
<p>The fact is that this casino does not pay my money, the worst thing is that they do not provide a solution and say that they do not have information, denying the fault of the provider, and I am helpless since they do not want to pay me my money, operating this casino in Spain and being regulated by gaming regulations, being illegal to retain my money.</p>
