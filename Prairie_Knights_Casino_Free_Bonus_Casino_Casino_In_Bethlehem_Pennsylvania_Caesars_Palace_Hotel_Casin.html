<p>Las Vegas Wants Adele to Say “Hello” to Residency Show</p>

<p>“Adele, hello, can you hear me?” Las Vegas is reportedly in a calling frenzy to land the British singer-songwriter for a residency show on the famed Strip.</p>

<p>According to various reports, as many as three prevalent casinos on South Las Vegas Boulevard are making pitches to the London-based superstar to relocate to the Mojave Desert and follow in the footsteps of names like Celine Dion, Cher, Elton John, and most recently, Britney Spears and Mariah Carey.</p>
<p>MGM, The Venetian, and Caesars are all reportedly in the mix, and are offering hundreds of thousands of dollars per night to land the talent who has sold over 100 million records worldwide.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if all the wooing is having any effect on Adele. Her live tour is scheduled to conclude in July, and she’s expected to take time off afterwards in order to take care of her four-year-old who has been traveling with her.</p>
<p>Online sportsbooks aren’t taking odds on whether Adele might accept such an offer. Residency shows are often sought after by A-list musicians due to the high-stakes money and riddance of travel.</p>
<p>The one that continues to get away, however, is of course Madonna. She was once reportedly offered $1 billion for a five-year residency, but said last spring, “I’d rather die than work in Vegas.”</p>
<p>More Millennials, More Money</p>
<p>Though Adele, nor the aforementioned resorts, have confirmed any concrete Las Vegas residency discussions, it wouldn’t be surprising if the rumors turned out to be true.</p>
<p>Casinos across the nation are going after hipper concert acts that appeal to younger audiences. The millennial is the most desirable demographic in 2017, as the generation is now young adults who finally have some of their own money to spend.</p>
<p>Unlike the Baby Boomers and Generation X that came before them, millennials aren’t as interested in simple games of chance like slots. That presents a long-term outlook problem for gambling companies who make more money on the levers than any other floor offering.</p>
<p>Skill-based games are currently being tested and rolled out at select venues, but to know if the millennial will take favor to them, the casino must first get the young adult in the door. A simple review of who Vegas is booking for residencies highlights the focus on the 20 and 30-somethings.</p>
<p>In addition to Britney Spears and Mariah Carey, Ricky Martin recently announced a residency show at Monte Carlo that will launch in April. Caesars also extended Jennifer Lopez’s stay at Planet Hollywood through October 2017.</p>
<p>Rolling in the Deep</p>
<p>The rumor mill is churning out claims that Adele is readying to step aside from touring for 10 years to be with her son as he attends school and will no longer be able to accompany her on the road.</p>
<p>That’s giving fuel to the Adele-Vegas speculation, as she could live and work in Sin City and send her son to a private school there.</p>
<p>Though she has an estimated net worth of $125 million, the three casinos pitching Adele are reportedly ready to offer her $500,000 per night.</p>
