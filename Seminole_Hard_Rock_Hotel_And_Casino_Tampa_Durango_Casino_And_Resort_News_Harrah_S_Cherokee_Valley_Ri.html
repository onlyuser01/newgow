    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tampa Durango Casino And Resort News Harrah S Cherokee Valley Ri</h1>

<p>Azure Gaming America, a prominent developer of premium quality products for the gaming industry across the globe, has struck a new partnership with Play Synergy. Play Synergy is a casino game manufacturer and distributor and will now leverage Azure’s Class II and Historical Horse Racing titles across North America.</p>
<p>Play Synergy and Azure Gaming Join Forces to Expand Content</p>
<p>The games will be integrated with Play Synergy’s own Speed and Hyper Speed Cabinets. According to the companies, they will both benefit from a significant market advantage that is available to them collectively through this new tie-up and newly discovered synergies. The partnership was welcomed by Play Synergy president Frank Feng who added:</p>
<p>Class II and HHR are all about content. By expanding our partnership with Aruze, we gain immediate access to an extensive library of popular game themes as well as a library of themes that have not yet reached Class II and HHR. Play Synergy president Frank Feng</p>
<p>Play Synergy is happy for the opportunity to add more titles to its state-of-the-art cabinets whereas Azure Gaming is happy to deploy its products to new cabinets, and markets, and seek to strike home with new audiences. The companies are “tackling market expansion,” as part of a concentrated effort, „leading to unique gambling experiences.</p>
<p>Azure Gaming to Launch with Class II and HHR Cabinets</p>
<p>Azure Gaming feels confident that titles such as Go Go Claw and Rock Paper Scissors Instant Win are already going to be a hit with players. The games draw inspiration from arcade gaming and are distinct from any gaming cabinet available to venues worldwide. Azure Gaming America president Rob Ziems commented on this partnership:</p>
<p>This partnership not only brings two leading companies together but also brings our best and most exciting titles to new markets across North America. He was confident that the expansion of Play Synergy’s cabinets was an obvious choice to provide gamblers with even more “award-winning fun.” Earlier this year, Azure Gaming appointed Mitsuhiro Miyazaki as SVP of product management for the Asia Pacific.</p>
