<p>Global sports betting and gaming operator GVC Holdings announced today it retained its position in the FTSE4Good Index Series. The successful index review for the company came within the same week when it received its verifications regarding carbon emissions from the Carbon Trust.</p>
<p>FTSE4Good Index Series</p>
<p>The FTSE4Good Index Series is measuring performance against a strong set of criteria regarding environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. The transparent management and clearly-defined criteria make the launched in 2001 index series suitable for assessing sustainable investment products with regards to a wide range of market needs.</p>
<p>GVC announced it passed a rigorous independent assessment during the annual index review which focused on governance, in terms of risk management, corporate governance and anti-corruption, social practices, including human rights, labor standards and health and safety, and environmental commitments in terms of energy usage and management of waste.</p>
<p>Carbon Trust Verification</p>
<p>Within the same week in which GVC retained its place in the FTSE4Good Index Series, the global gaming operator received an independent verification of its carbon emissions data from the Carbon Trust. The expert body which dedicates its resources to help businesses, governments and organizations around the world to realize their plans related to a sustainable, low carbon future, verified GVC’s 2019 data. The data verification showed a 10% reduction compared to the year before.</p>
<p>“These are two significant measures of our commitment to operating GVC to the highest standards of environmental, social and governance practices. We are delighted with the progress that we have made in these areas and are committed to driving further improvements throughout our business.” Shay Segev, CEO, GVC Holdings</p>
<p>The verification from the Carbon Trust is an important performance measure and is tracked by a number of ESG rating agencies, to help markets evaluate investment opportunities against environmental, social and governance criteria. GVC noted it would continue to work with the assessment body to achieve a Carbon Management Standard, in line with the group’s ongoing objective to reduce its impact on the environment.</p>
<p>The global sports betting and gaming operator is determined to achieve these objectives while continuing its obligations regarding the communities it operates, including contributing to the issue of problem gambling.</p>
<p>GVC was the largest contributor during fiscal 2019-20 of GambleAware, the charity which collects donations from gaming companies to support the Gambling Commission’s efforts to reduce gambling harm, with a donation of £1.46 million.</p>
