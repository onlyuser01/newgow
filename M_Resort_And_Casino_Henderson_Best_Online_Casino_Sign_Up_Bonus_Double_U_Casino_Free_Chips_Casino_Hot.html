    <h1>M Resort And Casino Henderson Best Online Casino Sign Up Bonus Double U Casino Free Chips Casino Hot</h1>

<p>The popularity of free-to-play games continues to have fans and business enrapt, with BoyleSports confirming a partnership extension with a relevant supplier</p>
<p>Moving forward, BoyleSports will continue to work with 20SHOTS, a company that specializes in the provision of free-to-play games designed to lead to better engagement with players.</p>
<p>The sportsbook will have the opportunity to leverage the supplier’s Fantasy5 games – which it has been doing under the terms of a previous partnership – which it has already deployed with success as part of a new business extension agreed to by both parties.</p>
<p>BoyleSports Renews Fantasy5 For Another Season</p>
<p>The free-to-play soccer game allows BoyleSports players and consumers to engage with a product that is designed to cover the Premier League and the essence of the betting competition without expecting players to place real money wagers. Commenting on the success of the partnerships so far, BoyleSports marketing director Aimee Prendergast said:</p>
<p>We have found Fantasy5 to be a great retention and engagement tool for our players and we look forward to continuing our partnership with 20SHOTS. BoyleSports marketing director Aimee Prendergast</p>
<p>Fantasy5 will allow players to pick five players from the Premier League and accumulate points based on said players’ performance. There is a weekly jackpot worth £5,000 that is granted to any player who sees their selection beat the fantasy points targets in a given week.</p>
<p>20SHOTS co-founder and CEO Jacob Kalms welcomed the contract renewal as an important milestone for the company and what it means for its fantasy offering. Kalms hailed the opportunity to extend its partnership with BoyleSports, which was the first operator to put its trust in 20SHOTS and its elaborate fantasy products, giving it a solid start with betting companies.</p>
<p>Free-to-Play Reaping Success with Operators</p>
<p>Kalms assured that there are other partnerships in the works that will be coming over the next weeks and that will allow Fantasy5 and the company’s other products to gather momentum as well. “We are delighted to be continuing our partnership with BoyleSports. It was very successful last year, and we believe Fantasy5 will continue to complement its other products very well,” Kalms added.</p>
<p>20SHOTS has already been able to secure several prominent partnerships with established and esteemed operators, including Grosvenor Casinos. The company itself has been able to attract significant interest from investors who have seen the value of building free-to-play fantasy platforms designed to elevate the user experience at real-money sportsbooks and seek to channel casual and recreational bettors into paying customers.</p>
