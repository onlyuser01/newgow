<p>One of the leading multi-channel supplier of live betting services ahs expanded its horse racing content distribution in Italy with a prominent local entity</p>
<p>As a result, SIS (Sports Information Services) will provide its horse racing content with ISIBET Pro, a platform that is fully regulated in the Italian market and will lead to significant gains for both companies.</p>
<p>ISISBET Pro Lets SIS Expand in Italy</p>
<p>ISIBET Pro platform works with both digital as well as retail solutions and it offers access to more than 35,000 horse races annually from across 170 racecourses. The coverage includes races from Africa, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and the United States, which have a very strong tradition in racing.</p>
<p>Moving forward, SIS’s own 24/7 Live Betting Channels will be available as part of the platform and bring with it extensive additional markets and prices to boost the consumer experience and offer a greater variety of options. ISIBET Pro is just the latest partnership SIS has signed in the European market, as the company continues to scale its reach and expand the range of partners it works with, including a recent tie-up in Poland.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity and partnerships ISIBET Pro CEO Romano Biondi said that he was excited to see the company team up with SIS, which offers the right type of product to further boost the content variety clients in Italy can get both in retail and online. He added:</p>
<p>By offering regular races around the clock from all over the world, we believe that Italian customers will eagerly embrace the wide range of betting options available to them. ISIBET Pro CEO Romano Biondi</p>
<p>SIS Is Determined to Continue Growing Across Europe</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly welcomed by SIS commercial manager for UK and Europe, Prean Naidu, who was very happy with the opportunity to see his company grow its local footprint in Europe yet again. This, he said, was an opportunity to continue growing SIS’s products in Europe and deliver more quality products and content to Italian bettors.</p>
<p>“It is another illustration of the value of our proposition, as we continue to deliver cutting-edge, round-the-clock and revenue-driving products to operators,” SIS wrapped up. SIS Has also been looking to scale its presence globally, with the company sponsoring Chile’s Gran Premio Hipódromo events.</p>
