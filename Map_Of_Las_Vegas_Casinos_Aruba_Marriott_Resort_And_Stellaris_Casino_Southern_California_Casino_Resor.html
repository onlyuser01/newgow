    <h1>Map Of Las Vegas Casinos Aruba Marriott Resort And Stellaris Casino Southern California Casino Resor</h1>

<p>Get 3 scatters in the game "Gorilla Kingdom". During the free spins with an amount of just under € 80, a PoP Up window "Play break 5 minutes ..." came to the fore from the casino. During this time, the free spins were barely visible in the background. At the last free spin the game will stop with the message "Game no longer available".</p>
<p>After the 5 minute break, I had to restart the Gorilla Kingdom game. It started from scratch on the surface. No more free spin mode to be seen. Even the winnings of almost € 80 that had been made up to that point (and the free spins actually continued to run) was not added to my account balance.</p>
<p>According to the chat staff (I was passed from one to the next until finally the third member of staff felt responsible for it) I was informed that, according to the game level, the game had not yet ended and was therefore not yet finished.</p>
<p>That would happen automatically for the next hour ...</p>
<p>Of course it hasn't happened until now. Was turned away in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>Played there with bonus money. In games where there was hardly any profit distribution, I was able to play longer and longer.</p>
<p>At games where I got smaller big wins several times, I strangely did not get the message "Your sizing limit has been reached" and it was not possible to continue playing.</p>
<p>The most popular games were not playable anyway due to bonus money.</p>
<p>Those currently current games such as "Hells Kitchen", which should be playable despite bonus money, then immediately had the notice when loading: "Technical error ..."</p>
<p>The shop there smells a lot!</p>
