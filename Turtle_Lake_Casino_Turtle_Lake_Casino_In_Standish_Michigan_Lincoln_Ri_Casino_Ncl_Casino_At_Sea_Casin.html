<p>High 5 Games, a developer of online casino games, and BetMGM, a prominent iGaming and betting brand in the United State, have signed a new content alliance</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by High 5 Games CEO Tony Singer who said that BetMGM has been a fantastic partner to the brand already and that their relationship was now set to grow beyond that, in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>High 5 Games Strikes Second Big Content Partnership in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>High 5 Games and BetMGM are already working on similar content partnerships in New Jersey, Ontario, and Michigan, with players in these states and the province able to access the studio’s titles through BetMGM in these jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Singer was pleased with the development, assuring players that they would be able to get a number of High 5’s excellent titles, including access to the Rapid Rewards which is the in-game journey promotions system. “We can’t wait to roll out more of our content in Pennsylvania and expand with BetMGM as they move into new markets,” Singer noted.</p>
<p>The collection of titles available in Pennsylvania will now include Triple Double Da Vinci Diamonds, Green Machine Deluxe, Platinum Goddess and so much more. High 5 Games is seeking to consolidate its presence with flagship operators in North America, among which is Rush Street Interactive (RSI).</p>
<p>Similar to its arrangement with BetMGM, High 5 Games is actually working closely with RSI in Michigan, New Jersey, and Ontario. High 5 Games and RSI are also present together through the BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse brands in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>High 5 Games received its license to enter the market in the Keystone State in July and the two rapid partnerships it has secured since have been a considerable boost for the company’s geographic footprint in the United States.</p>
