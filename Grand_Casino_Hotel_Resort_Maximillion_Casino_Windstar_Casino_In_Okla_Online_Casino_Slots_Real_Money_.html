    <h1>Grand Casino Hotel Resort Maximillion Casino Windstar Casino In Okla Online Casino Slots Real Money</h1>

<p>I noticed people complaining about this casino but the complaints seem ti be from about a couple months back so I figured they got there shit together. I played on Tuesday won and attempted to withdrawal on wednesday. They dont remove your withdrawal from your balance so you got to be attentive your self to not go over your withdrawal + whatever funds you still have. I had 1700 tried withdrawing 1200. At first I noticed they broke the withdrawal into 3 parts. 2 at $500 and one at $200. I like this method because if i do dip into my funds atleast the whole withdrawal wont be nullified. I played until i had $600 left then noticed that the $200 and one of the $500 withdrawals had been removed. But I still had one $500. I kept playing and now i have around $2200. I attempted to withdrawal $1000 more so it wouldve been a total of $1500 being withdrawn. I completed the kyc verification properly then attempted to sign in on friday but my account is blocked. I couldnt believe it, they said that someone else made a deposit to my account, guess who it wasâ€¦. G. Raymond!!! The name rang a bell so I googled it. In most online banking websites when you log into your account if theres a picture of your card the name on it says g. Raymond. They offered that if i give back the funds that i can keep playing? Wtf i dont risk my money to hear sounds and see patterns matching. I do it to win more money. They asked for so many different things amd luckily i took pics of receipts and showed them everything they wanted. The guy said be patient if theres nothing wrong with your account ill get paid. Whats next? I cant believe these guys are actually licensed. Im giving them a chance til monday to fix this then im going full Elliot Ness on these people. Curacao licensing first place Ill bombard with emails phone calls even good old post letters until Vulkan Vegas fixes this problem. Personally I dont care much to get people or sites into trouble but if they dont fix my situation by monday ill do everything i can.</p>
