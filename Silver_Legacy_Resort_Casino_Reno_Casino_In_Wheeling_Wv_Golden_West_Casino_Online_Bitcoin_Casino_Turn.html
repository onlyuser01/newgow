<p>After being granted an online gambling license by Spillemyndigheden, Denmark's gambling authority, Soft2Bet moved a step further in achieving its core business objectives of 2022.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet will now be able to offer its extensive iGaming services to Danish players with the new license. This includes online bingo, sports betting and an entire range of online casino games, including blackjack, roulette, punto banco and poker.</p>
<p>The company's latest strategic move is part of its expansion plans for the new year. It is currently expanding its global footprint in several regulated markets.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet's Head of Country Team, Peter Christian Noer, said that "obtaining this license is a tremendous moment for Soft2Bet."</p>
<p>He added, "Our entire team has put in a tremendous amount of effort and worked tirelessly to ensure we met all the requirements and deadlines to achieve this important milestone in our company's history."</p>
<p>Soft2Bet's entry into Denmark has increased its presence in the Nordic region. It already holds a license to operate in Sweden under the Spelinspektionen, the Swedish Gambling Authority.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet stated that the new license demonstrates Soft2Bet's commitment to Denmark's stringent customer care obligations. This jurisdiction is regarded as one of the strictest in Europe.</p>
<p>Noer asserted, "We now look forward to launching our innovative iGaming brands on the Danish market that have proven successful in other jurisdictions because of their state-of-the-art features, unique game supply and strong player protection tools."</p>
<p>Soft2Bet launched in Sweden only two years ago. Since then, it has found a significant market share. The company expects to see the same results in Denmark as it enters the market.</p>
<p>Soft2bet is one of Europe's leading online platform and operator providers. The company was founded in 2005 by a small group of industry experts. Today, it employs more than 800 people.</p>
<p>"This massive achievement is the product of uncompromising dedication and one more great accomplishment for our outstanding team to be proud about," said Noer. "It's also important to thank the Danish Gambling Authority for a positive, collaborative and helpful dialogue throughout the licence application process."</p>
<p>Soft2Bet has been working hard at increasing its footprint. Last month, it reached a content agreement with iSoftBet to handle the integration of the latter's innovative slot content.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet customers are able to access iSoftBet's 150+ proprietary titles, iGaming products and growing library of Megaways via its Game Aggregation Platform.</p>
<p>GAP by iSoftBet is one of the best content aggregators available on the market. It allows some of the biggest iGaming brands to quickly and reliably access the latest regulated territory via a single integration.</p>
<p>The agreement makes iSoftBet more active in 21 regulated countries. iSoftBet has already secured numerous deals in the past months across the globe, and recently released its Jackpot Tool player engagement product.</p>
