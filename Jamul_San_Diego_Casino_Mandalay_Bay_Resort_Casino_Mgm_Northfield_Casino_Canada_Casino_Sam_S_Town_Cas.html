    <h1>Jamul San Diego Casino Mandalay Bay Resort Casino Mgm Northfield Casino Canada Casino Sam S Town Cas</h1>

<p>So I got sent a free chip and won some money off of it. I had 146 available to withdrawal. I even played through and it popped up saying I could withdrawal. So I requested for 100 to withdrawal. Then I sent in 10$ Litecoin to verify my account and I closed my browser and didn't play after that. I should have had 56$ available to use. When I logged back in everything was gone. I spoke to support and the man I spoke with was very rude. He said that it was money that I shouldn't have won because it was won off a bonus. Well first of all they sent me an email with the free plays. I don't feel I did anything wrong.He did tell me I would get my Litecoin sent back to my original wallet that same night. So I waited till the next day and it still wasn't there. So I contacted support again and this time it was a woman. She was nice enough. She told me that I would still receive my 10$ back and after she checked it a second time came back and said that I used it already and wouldn't receive it back. I said how that was possible because I logged off after sending it and only knew that it was deposited because of the email I received. I think they are a big scam and 2ould not recommend using them. They took not only what I won fair and square even after my play through but also what I left on my account and the money I deposited.</p>
