    <h1>Uk Online Casino Treasure Island Resort Casino Minnesota Mt Pleasant Mi Casino Seneca Casino Ny Prai</h1>

<p>Im going to share my review here with you guys about the Casino matter:</p>
<hr />
<p>I used to be a regular player on this casino, withdrawals usually were processed fast in less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>the last deposit I made was 80$ and from the casino end was a delay, I was okay with that, and while I was waiting I decided to play elsewhere.</p>
<p>the next day I decided to no play and take my funds back and noticed that my withdrawal was canceled.</p>
<p>I opened a conversation with customer service to investigate why my own money with no bonuses was kept by the casino and they said that it is mandatory to wager the amount deposited, under the argument that they don't operate as a bank. To avoid money laundering they have the right to hold my money.</p>
<p>After I opened a complaint on casino. guru and I got the bad news:</p>
<p>Quote -"Unfortunately, at this time, our hands are tied. I would recommend that you complete the wagering requirements the casino sets because you wonâ€™t be able to withdraw your funds."-</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>I have given away 80$ because I cannot change my mind, can you imagine that 80 dollars is a money laundry? (in the first place they always ask bank statements to detect see how legit is the source of income and verify your ID)</p>
<p>That it is a low and cheap way to take your money and force you to lose your cash. So no I was a total naive. I was forced to, reactivate the account and play-give away the 80$.</p>
<p>I will never play in that place again. Advice to players, make sure you are ready to lose all your money because are never going to be able to withdraw your money until you at least wager the equivalent of your deposit.</p>
