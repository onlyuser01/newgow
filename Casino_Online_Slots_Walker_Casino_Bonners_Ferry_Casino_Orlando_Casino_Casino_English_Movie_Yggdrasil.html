    <h1>Casino Online Slots Walker Casino Bonners Ferry Casino Orlando Casino Casino English Movie Yggdrasil</h1>

<p>Yggdrasil, a major iGaming publisher, has unveiled a partnership agreement with Holland Casino Online, a Dutch iGaming operator. Under the agreement, the former company will provide the operator with proprietary content and content from its partnering studios.</p>
<p>Players in the Netherlands will thus get to experience Yggdrasil’s full portfolio of content. Local gamblers will be able to try out a variety of games sporting the supplier’s industry-leading game engagement mechanics and hit titles.</p>
<p>In addition to powering Holland Casino Online with in-house content, Yggdrasil will make its YG Masters products available to customers of the casino.</p>
<p>Some of the latest games released by Yggdrasil’s partnering studios include Bang Bang Games’ innovative Roamin’ Romans UltraNudge slot and 4ThePlayer’s 10,000 BC DoubleMax slot. At the beginning of this month, Yggdrasil also released an exciting title called Shaker Club.</p>
<p>The agreement with Holland Casino Online will allow Yggdrasil to expand its footprint in the country where its products already enjoy a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Is Happy to Team Up with an Operator It Admires</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s chief of commercial operations, Andrew Pegler, commented on the new agreement in the Netherlands. He expressed his team’s delight to team up with Holland Casino Online and lauded the operator as a powerhouse in the regulated Dutch market.</p>
<p>Agreement with Holland Casino Online will further strengthen Yggdrasil’s position in the growing and exciting regulated Dutch market. Andrew Pegler, CCO, Yggdrasil</p>
<p>Pegler added that Yggdrasil knows the Dutch market “extremely well” and is happy to grow its presence there by forming a partnership with a brand it “admires greatly.”</p>
<p>Nicolas Fleiderman, manager at Holland Casino Online, also shared his thoughts on the deal. He praised Yggdrasil’s drive for innovation and the publisher’s best-in-class gaming titles. Fleiderman added that Holland Casino Online is thrilled by the prospect to offer these very same titles to its players.</p>
<p>We’re delighted to be able to offer its portfolio to our loyal customers and look forward to forming a fantastic partnership. From classic titles to industry-leading game mechanics, we are confident our players will love everything Yggdrasil has to offer them. Nicolas Fleiderman, manager, Holland Casino Online</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Holland Casino Online also secured online gambling content from EveryMatrix. Under the deal, the latter company agreed to leverage its Spearhead Studios and Armadillo Studios to supply games to the Dutch operator.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Holland Casino also secured a bespoke soccer-themed game from RubyPlay.</p>
