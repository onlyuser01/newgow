<p>Mohegan has made sure to strengthen its digital communications capabilities by officially appointing Heather Menzano as the new vice president of web communications. Menzano will oversee the entertainment and gaming brand’s development of the app and casino website in North America.</p>
<p>Menzano Has Plenty of PR and Marketing Experience</p>
<p>As an industry veteran, Menzano has taken various marketing and public relations roles at well-established brands. Some of those brands include Caesars Entertainment, Resorts Casino Hotel and Revel Entertainment. Resorts Casino Hotel is a brand managed by Mohegan.</p>
<p>In her new role, Menzano will be tasked with elevating both public and guest communications with the goal of growing potential revenue channels. She will be leading strategic planning, monitoring and reporting and will set goals for the annual marketing plan of Mohegan. KPI reporting will also be one of her responsibilities.</p>
<p>She will report to George Galinsky, the senior vice president of marketing communications. Apart from the aforementioned responsibilities, Menzano will be responsible for creating various communications strategies with corporate heads across various PR, social media and marketing operations.</p>
<p>Galinsky took a moment to comment on Menzano’s appointment. He said that she joins Mohegan “at a pivotal time” and thanks to the fact that she has over 14 years of working experience in strategic communications, Galinsky thinks that she will “undoubtedly contribute to Mohegan’s continued growth.”</p>
<p>Mohegan’s Growth in North America Does Not Include Just the US</p>
<p>Mohegan is dedicated to expanding and increasing its influence not just in the US, but on an international level. Back in May, the gaming company teamed up with Kambi in a strategic mobile sportsbook partnership in Canada.</p>
<p>Thanks to this agreement, Kambi was made in charge of providing Fallsview Casino, which is located in Ontario, with mobile betting solutions. Fallsview is the largest casino resort in Ontario.</p>
<p>Rich Roberts, Mohegan’s president, said that this is the first mobile gaming product that Mohegan has outside of the US and the company is looking forward to exceeding expectations. Roberts also added that the current period is very exciting for the mobile gaming industry.</p>
<p>Kambi’s CEO and co-founder, Kristian Nylén, doubled down on Roberts’ statement and added that the Canadian market has a lot of potential, especially in Ontario. This is Canada’s biggest province and online gambling was officially launched there on April 4, 2022.</p>
<p>The Canadian Gaming Association stated that Ontario’s regulated online gambling market can make almost $1 billion in gross revenue in its inception year. Paul Burns, the CEO of CGA, stated that the association finally has the opportunity to “safeguard the economic benefits” that come from licensed and regulated online gambling.</p>
