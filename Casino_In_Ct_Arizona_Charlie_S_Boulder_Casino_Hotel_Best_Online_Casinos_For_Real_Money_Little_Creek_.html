<p>STS, the leading sports betting operator in Poland, announced it forged a new deal, allowing it to expand its esports offering. The company unveiled Monday it joined forces with Twain Sport for the delivery of two new games. As a result, Twain Sport’s games provider, BetGames, delivered two esports variations for STS’ customers. Those are T-basket 24/7, an ebasketball title, as well as T-kick 24/7, an efootball game.</p>
<p>Expanding its esports portfolio marks an important milestone for the leading Polish betting operator. The delivery of new games is expected to help complement the growth of the operator, engage with new audiences and help retain existing clients.</p>
<p>The newly expanded esports portfolio comes on the heels of an important deal announced by STS. Last month, the company confirmed it joined forces with GKS Katowice. Under the terms of the collaboration, the leading betting and gaming operator agreed to sponsor all of the club’s teams. At the same time, it vowed to deliver different promotional offers for GKS Katowice fans.</p>
<p>The Two Esports Games Deliver Unstoppable Entertainment</p>
<p>But what can esports fans expect from the two new titles provided by BetGames? T-basket 24/7 and T-kick 24/7 bring unrivaled and unstoppable esports action. The titles present professional athletes in a one-on-one match with the goal being to score as many points as possible within one minute or 60 seconds.</p>
<p>According to Twain Sport, the game screen presents two halves of a small field, which can be a basketball or a football one. The fields are presented one next to the other and each athlete needs to take a ball from a highlighted rack that is chosen randomly and then score a point. For each point, the athletes need to hit one highlighted field out of a total of six.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the two new esports titles that will be available for STS’ customers is the frequency of the game rounds. While matches last only 1 minute, games start every 120 seconds. What’s more important is that the games are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, providing unstoppable action for esports fans. With 30 games played every hour, T-kick 24/7 and T-basket 24/7 deliver thrilling entertainment via 720 games every single day.</p>
