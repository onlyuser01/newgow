<p>The award-winning provider of games for the online gambling sector, Evoplay, announced the release of a new thrilling instant game. The company confirmed earlier this week that it launched October Pub, its newest instant game that features an engaging beer festival theme and offers multipliers.</p>
<p>The latest game from Evoplay brings quality graphics, vibrant colors and crisp sound effects. It features an RTP of 96.00%, a maximum win of €75,000 and supports a dozen languages, a statement reveals. October Pub invites the players on an adventure to a fun-filled tavern where they can experience a bustling beer festival.</p>
<p>Ivan Kravchuk, Evoplay's CEO, was thrilled about the launch of the recent instant game. "In the spirit of October, Evoplay’s latest instant game gives players a reason to cheer their glasses as they attempt to pour the perfect pint and land a refreshing reward," he explained.</p>
<p>Finally, Kravchuk said: "Evoplay’s instant games utilize our proprietary technology and have successfully managed to appeal to previously untapped audiences, and we anticipate another great reaction to our new in-house brew, October Pub."</p>
<p>Online players that tune in for Evoplay's new instant game can activate up to five pints of beer and fill them up. Players that fill up the glasses have a chance of reaching multipliers between 2x and 100x of their bet.</p>
<p>The game starts with an empty glass on top of a bar counter. To activate more glasses, players need to tap the empty placeholders on the left and right sides. Then, they can select a glass and a bet and start pouring beer. If the glass fills up to a multiplier mark, they secure a win but in case the beer runs out, their wager is lost.</p>
<p>The game offers engaging gameplay, considering that it grants the users a chance to secure multipliers, paving the way for significant payouts. Yet, if they run out of beer, they lose the multiplier for the specific glass. Winnings from the game based on multipliers can be collected at any time with the collect button. To elevate the excitement and thrill further, October Pub allows the players to select which glasses they want to collect their winnings from and continue playing with other glasses independently.</p>
<p>The recently released instant game comes on the heels of an important collaboration announced by Evoplay recently. Last week, the company confirmed it inked a deal with Interwetten, a leading betting and iGaming operator. As a result, the iGaming content supplier agreed to provide its portfolio of games, powering the operator's offering.</p>
