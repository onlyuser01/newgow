<p>The leading developer, owner and manager of premier entertainment resorts across the United States, Canada and Northern Asia, Mohegan, announced it strengthened the C-suite of Mohegan Digital, its iGaming division. Details regarding the new appointment emerged in a statement last week and see the seasoned expert with solid experience and track record, Guy Greene, become Mohegan Digital's new Vice President of Online Marketing.</p>
<p>This strategic role seeks to propel the expansion of Mohegan's iGaming division. As a VP of Online Marketing, Greene will oversee the development and implementation of strategies that seek to expand the company's online gambling products, such as PlayFallsViewCasino.com in Ontario, Canada as well as MoheganSunCasino.com in Connecticut.</p>
<p>A graduate of Eastern Connecticut State University, the new VP of Online Marketing currently holds professional certifications from the Six Sigma Global Institute and the Project Management Institute. He currently resides in Old Lyme with Vimala Greene, his wife, who happens to be an Executive Assistant for the Mohegan Tribe.</p>
<p>Greene's career within the gaming sector dates back to 1996 when he joined Mohegan Sun as Player's Club Manager. Moving up the ranks, he was promoted to different marketing-related positions. Later on, Greene became a part of OverAbove Marketing &amp; Advertising Agency where he held the role of Strategic Account &amp; Program Director. He remained in that role until 2020.</p>
<p>Before accepting the VP of Online Marketing Role at Mohegan Digital, Greene held the position of Director of Loyalty Digital Marketing at Mohegan. During his tenure with the company, he played an important part in the merger of the company's loyalty platform, Momentum, with its iGaming platforms and mobile applications. While holding the role of Director of Loyalty Digital Marketing, Greene was able to accumulate strategic knowledge and insights, something that will undoubtedly help him now.</p>
<p>Rich Roberts, Mohegan Digital's President, shared his excitement on the topic saying: "Guy Greene has a wealth of Marketing knowledge and experience in the gaming industry and Mohegan is thrilled to have him lead our Online Marketing team." Finally, he explained: "Our iGaming business has seen tremendous success and to carry that success forward, and to further evolve and meet new demands in this fast-growing industry, a proven leader like Greene will be vital."</p>
<p>As VP of Online Marketing, Greene will spearhead the efforts of the company's Online Marketing team. He will contribute to the development of advertising campaigns that seek to boost customer engagement and acquisition and help promote Mohegan's online gambling and betting operations.</p>
