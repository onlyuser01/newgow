<p>The award-winning iGaming provider offering more than 160 video slots, table, instant and branded games, Evoplay, has announced it secured a prestigious certification, recognizing its efforts to safeguard data and comply with international regulations for privacy. The company confirmed it has secured an ISO 27701 certification, following an extensive audit process.</p>
<p>ISO 27701 is a certification that recognizes the efforts of companies in information security, privacy protection and cybersecurity. It is applicable for private, as well as public companies, non-profit and governmental organizations. The certification reaffirms an organization's commitment to adhering to privacy protection and ensuring the safety of its data.</p>
<p>Evoplay's CEO, Ivan Kravchuk, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "Obtaining ISO 27701 certification is a crucial step in ensuring the privacy and security within Evoplay and our interaction with other companies." He pointed out that the certification is applicable within all of the company's operating segments, including relations with employees, partners and game development.</p>
<p>Finally, Kravchuk noted: "The accreditation not only demonstrates our commitment to responsible data management and handling but also provides a competitive edge by assuring our partners that their privacy is of utmost importance to us."</p>
<p>The company explained that the certification is the result of the diligent efforts of its team of experts. To secure the ISO 27701 certificate, Evoplay's privacy management system has gone through an extensive audit.</p>
<p>Now, securing the certificate reaffirms the company's efforts to protect its data, as well as the data of its employees and partners. Moreover, Evoplay noted that the certification highlights the "implementation of rigorous privacy controls to ensure compliance with the applicable privacy laws and regulations." Thanks to the certification, new and existing partners can be sure that their data is safe, explained the company.</p>
<p>The leading iGaming developer also noted that data privacy is one of its ongoing strategic goals, which is now recognized by the certification. "We are proud to have reached this milestone, and we will continue to strive for excellence in all aspects of privacy management," explained Evoplay.</p>
<p>The recent certification comes on the heels of another important announcement by Evoplay. Earlier this month, the company confirmed it expanded its presence in the Netherlands via a new partnership with Kansspel.nu.</p>
<p>This marked an important deal for Evoplay, as it helped expand the reach of its content to new audiences. Besides strengthening its presence in the Netherlands, the deal with Kansspel.nu helped the company grow its footprint in Europe. On the other hand, the operator also benefitted from the partnership by delivering new and engaging games for its growing customer base.</p>
