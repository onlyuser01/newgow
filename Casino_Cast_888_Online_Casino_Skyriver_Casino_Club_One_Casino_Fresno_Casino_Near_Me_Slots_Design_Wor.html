    <h1>Casino Cast 888 Online Casino Skyriver Casino Club One Casino Fresno Casino Near Me Slots Design Wor</h1>

<p>Innovative slot game developer Design Works Gaming (DWG) announced this week its content is now accessible for UK online casino players via Mr. Green, building on its successful partnership with William Hill.</p>
<p>Partnership to ‘Continue to Evolve and Grow’</p>
<p>Following the DWG content launch with Mr. Green, a collection of the designer studio’s high-performing titles are now available to players in the UK, offering them to taste the new type of slot games, a product of the game-first mentality adopted by DWG.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new launch, DWG chief executive officer and founder Troy Zurawski outlined the pioneering role William Hill has been playing by championing DWG’s content in the UK for a few years already, hinting that an expansion of this partnership has always been on the cards.</p>
<p>“Making our games available to players at Mr. Green is a great way to reach a new audience who, like us, values creativity and an exceptional gaming experience. I expect this powerhouse partnership to continue to evolve and grow.” Troy Zurawski, CEO, Design Works Gaming</p>
<p>William Hill was among the first few brands to bring content from the innovative game studio to the UK market and following the strong performance of DWG game titles, as well as the acquisition of Mr. Green by William Hill in 2019, the addition of DWG’s content to Mr. Green’s offering was the next step forward.</p>
<p>William Hill was then acquired by US casino giant Caesars Entertainment and, as Caesars was interested in the US assets of the UK-based gaming operator, offered William Hill’s non-US assets, including its high street shops in the UK, for sale to the highest bidder, which turned out to be Gibraltar-based online gambling group 888 Holdings.</p>
<p>The partnership between DWG and William Hill will also explore the possibility of extending their collaboration into other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Series of 2022 Content Launches</p>
<p>The launch with Mr. Green is the latest for DWG since the start of 2022 which turns out to be quite busy for the founded in 2005 game studio that relies solely on in-house created content.</p>
<p>In January, DWG strengthened its UK presence after a launch with BetVictor, offering players to taste a range of their games, including Flippin Rich, Test Your Strength, Diamonds, Sapphires &amp; Rubies 4Play, and Tiger Palace, via integration with Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>In the US, DWG was green-lighted by Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection to launch its iGaming content in Connecticut, its fourth US jurisdiction after previous launches in New Jersey, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In February, the expansion in the UK continued after a content agreement with BoyleSports, again via integration with Relax Gaming, to offer online casino players 20 of its titles, including fan-favorites Double Fancy 7’s, Panda Queen and Diamonds, Sapphires &amp; Rubies.</p>
<p>Later in the month, DWG’s content launched with Parimatch via a partnership powered by Relax Gaming, offering players at Parimatch the experience of game titles such as Hold Your Horses and Double Fancy 7s, with additional titles to be added over time.</p>
