    <h1>Belterra Casino Ohio Turtle Lake Casino Wi Osage Casino Pawhuska Chukchansi Gold Casino Princess Cas</h1>

<p>I started off with a $50 free chip and won a considerable amount of money during this I deposited $30 I wagered thousands of dollars as requested until the amount showed as being a withdrawal balance..</p>
<p>i originally requested $1500 withdrawal and only $100 has been approved.</p>
<p>and the $1400 shows as a second transaction that states "manger withdrawal approved" im now being told that that's is a intentional reference for</p>
<p>money that is not being paid out..</p>
<p>my winnings were up over $10,000+ and I wagered it over and over.</p>
<p>there was a claws stating if a deposit was made and wagered winnings would be payable..</p>
<p>i did exactly that a wagered enough until it went into the withdrawal balance column..</p>
<p>I have attached photos (even found a screen shot of when my account was at $8000+ in the withdrawal balance) and that was after I made a deposit</p>
