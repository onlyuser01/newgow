<p>PokerGO is tapping into SuperDraft’s expertise to bring poker fantasy contests to the game in what has been described as a “long-overdue move” for both companies.</p>
<p>New Fantasy Opportunities Await in Poker with SuperDraft</p>
<p>Leading provider of poker content and event host PokerGO has teamed up with Caesars Entertainment’s daily fantasy platform, SuperDraft. The partnership will allow fans to participate in fantasy poker contests centered around mainstream professional tournaments from the game’s top-competitive tiers, a new concept to produce and deliver poker content.</p>
<p>PokerGO director of programming Brent Hanks welcomed the partnership and explained that the agreement with SuperDraft would allow poker fans to engage with various tailored poker offerings and offer a way into a “massive untapped market” that is currently dominated by fantasy sports.</p>
<p>Moving forward, poker will make its long-overdue debut in fantasy contests, Hanks explained and added that the two companies would set up the experience seamlessly. The partnership is set to debut in the United States at the same time the US Poker Open launches on June 3.</p>
<p>All the Main Poker Fantasy Events Covered</p>
<p>All PokerGO subscribers will be able to join and win contests launched on the SuperDraft app and focusing on some of the most prominent events in the poker ecosystem in the country. Among the listed events are such flagship tournaments as the US Poker Open, World Series of Poker, Super High Roller Bowl, Poker Masters, and more.</p>
<p>SuperDraft has also developed a bespoke scoring system that is based on player performance and chip stacks. Company founder and CEO Steve Wang was equally excited about the partnership and said that PokerGO enables SuperDraft to further expand on the sports gambling foundation and tap into yet another innovative vertical part of the fantasy experience.</p>
<p>“Adding poker into fantasy sports is an idea that we’ve discussed for years. Our innovative development team, in partnership with PokerGO, finally brought that idea to life. As the popularity of pro poker grows, this partnership will help us deliver what everyone immersed in the world of poker has been waiting for,” Wang added.</p>
