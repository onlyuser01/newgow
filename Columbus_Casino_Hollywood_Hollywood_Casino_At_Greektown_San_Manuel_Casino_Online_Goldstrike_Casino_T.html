<p>The 10th addition to the popular Big Bass series brings engaging features, has an RTP of 96.07% and offers 147,456 paylines</p>
<p>The leading provider of games for the iGaming industry, Pragmatic Play, announced the release of its latest slot. On Monday, the company confirmed the launch of Big Bass Hold &amp; Spinner Megaways, the 10th addition of its popular Big Bass series.</p>
<p>Slot fans familiar with the famous Big Bass franchise know that the games feature an evergreen fishing theme. The latest slot game follows that tradition but elevates further the thrill and excitement by bringing the Hold &amp; Spinner feature.</p>
<p>Players of Big Bass Hold &amp; Spinner Megaways will see standard 10 to Ace card symbols, along with fishing-themed symbols, including a fishing rod and a fishing tackle box, among others. The release of the new slot comes after earlier this month, Pragmatic Play unveiled Pub Kings, a Viking-themed slot game with 20 paylines, RTP of 96.08% and a maximum win of 5,000x.</p>

<p>The Latest Slot Brings Engaging Features</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, shared her excitement about the new Big Bass Hold &amp; Spinner Megaways slot game. She revealed that the latest game from the popular franchise is the most thrilling within the series so far. Finally, Cornides said: “With an enhanced free spins round that introduces retriggers with multipliers for the first time, the gameplay is supercharged by the Hold &amp; Spinner feature and the star power of Megaways to create plenty of opportunities for players to reel in big prizes.”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to be able to introduce the tenth title in Pragmatic Play’s popular Big Bass franchise – and it’s an epic catch!“ Irina Cornides, chief operating officer at Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Recently, Pragmatic Play forged a partnership with Super 7 in Mendoza, Argentina. Under the terms of a new content deal, the iGaming provider agreed to power the operator with games.</p>
<p>But what can the players of Big Bass Hold &amp; Spinner Megaways expect? The game offers the popular tumbling mechanic that removes winning symbols from the reel, allowing new symbols to fall in their place, creating a potential for subsequent wins. This mechanic can be boosted further by the game’s Mystery symbols, granting a chance for even bigger payouts.</p>
<p>To access the free spins round, players need to land three or more Scatter symbols. The free spins game offers an extra feature that grants a chance for a multiplier of 2x, 3x and 10x to be awarded along with additional spins.</p>
<p>The highlight of the new game is the Hold &amp; Spinner feature. Online players can access the feature by landing three or more Coin Money symbols. “These Coins lock to the grid, awarding three respins and adding the value of each subsequent Coin to the total win,” explains Pragmatic Play.</p>
