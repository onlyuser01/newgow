<p>Stake.com, an international betting and gaming powerhouse, has confirmed that it’s expanding its crypto casino and sportsbook offering in Colombia through a partnership with TG Lab. TG Lab is a dedicated platform provider which will now ensure that the Stake.com.co domain rolls out, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>This news comes shortly after Stake made a move for Betfair Colombia in the country and made its intentions for the region known. TG Lab offers a powerful solution that will allow Stake to deliver the level of excellence that the company is looking for with every instance of its products.</p>
<p>TG Lab guarantees agile performance that works on native mobile apps and will ensure the smooth operation of both verticals and an omnichannel experience across the board. Stake.com is definitely looking to make its mark on the region throughout 2024, with Colombia making a very good first start.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity in a media release, Stake CSO Brais Pena said that the company had a clear ambition to expand on global markets. Colombia would make a great step in that direction, the company representative said, adding that TG Lab is also a powerful tech partner to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>"In TG Lab we have a proven platform and app provider that knows exactly what it takes to deliver a compelling player experience. This, combined with our brand, puts us on a sure path to success in Colombia," Pena explained, commenting on what the technology company brought to the table as well.</p>
<p>TG Lab CEO Ugnius Simelionis was similarly excited to be seeing this partnership through with Stake and make sure that a new brand launches on the Colombia market using his company’s distinct technological footprint.</p>
<p>"With our technology powering its online casino and sportsbook and mobile app, and its position as a leading brand, Stake has what it takes to become a true market leader in Colombia and we are delighted to be playing a part in its journey," Simelionis said.</p>
<p>TG Lab is interestingly not native to the Latin American region either, as the company is also now looking to expand locally and set its mark on a vibrant market that has plenty to offer and bring to players across numerous countries. The first step is to ensure that Stake does well in Colombia which will be a top priority for both partners as a matter of fact.</p>
