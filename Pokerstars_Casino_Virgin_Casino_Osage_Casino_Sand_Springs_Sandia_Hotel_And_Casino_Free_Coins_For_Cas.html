<p>Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas meet in the semifinal of the 2022 ATP Cincinnati Masters a.k.a. the Western &amp; Southern Open. This is perhaps the biggest match of the entire tournament, considering that the other semifinal is a clash between Cameron Norrie and Borna Coric, both of whom are seen as underdogs. The Medvedev vs Tsitsipas match, however, is a clash between the #1 and #4 seeds respectively.</p>

<p>Daniil Medvedev Trying to Cement His Place at the Top of the ATP Rankings</p>
<p>Medvedev is currently sitting at the summit of the ATP Rankings, but the question is for how long? The thing is that the 2022 US Open is fast approaching, which is the final Grand Slam of the year. Medvedev is the reigning champ, meaning that he’s defending 2,000 points there. In layman’s terms this means that if he fails there, he could end up dropping a couple of spots in the ATP List, depending on how his rivals perform.</p>
<p>This is why every point matters for Medvedev, including those in the build-up to the American Grand Slam. The winner of the ATP Cincinnati gets 1,000 ranking points and considering that Medvedev is defending 360 points from last year (when he reached the semifinal), he’s got a chance to add as much as 640 ranking points to his tally.</p>
<p>For that to happen, he needs to beat two more opponents. The first of those is Stefanos Tsitsipas, who’s going to be the highest-ranked rival Medvedev’s faced since February when he played against Rafael Nadal at the ATP Acapulco.</p>
<p>Stefanos Tsitsipas Hoping to Break the Spell Against Medvedev</p>
<p>Tsitsipas is 2-7 against Medvedev, with one of his wins happening at the ATP Finals, which is far from being Medvedev’s favorite event. Further, Tsitsipas’ second win over Medvedev happened at the French Open, a tournament played on grass, which is Medvedev’s least favorite type of playing surface.</p>
<p>The 2022 ATP Cincinnati is played on the hardcourt, which is the surface both players like. However, Tsitsipas has some bad experiences playing against Medvedev on this sort of court. The last time they met on the hardcourt (at the 2022 Australian Open), the Greek lost 3-1.</p>
<p>Daniil Medvedev vs Stefanos Tsitsipas Prediction</p>
<p>Medvedev hasn’t dropped a single set since the start of the 2022 Cincinnati Open. We think Tsitsipas might be able to snatch a set from him tonight, but the Greek player probably isn’t going to be able to win. It’s just that in summer 2022, Medvedev is a much better player than him.</p>
<p>Pick: Daniil Medvedev to win</p>
