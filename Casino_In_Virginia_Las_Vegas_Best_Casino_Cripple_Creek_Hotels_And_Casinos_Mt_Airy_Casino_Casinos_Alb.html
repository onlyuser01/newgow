<p>Additional comments from the player:</p>
<p>"Thank you in advance for the help!</p>
<p>Since it is a pay and play casino, the payment was of course made via Trustly!</p>
<p>Exactly this fact was criticized by the casino and I was asked to send a complete account statement for the month of November!</p>
<p>Which of course I won't do that either!</p>
<p>But that already shows what this is supposed to mean!</p>
<p>As with my predecessor with the same problems, it is then claimed in the end that the victim did not cooperate or did not submit all "required" account information! Not all data sent!</p>
<p>How the attempt is made to blame the victim!</p>
<p>All the effort for those few euros! (10 â‚¬)</p>
<p>I find it really difficult to understand why the casino acts like this with all the consequences and expenses that result from it!</p>
<p>What's more, I normally would have let the matter go! But the cheek, the deception and the targeted attrition strategy of the email "customer service" showed me that I have to act in order to spare others this experience!</p>
<p>For example, all of my emails mainly revolve around the fact that only once the blocking of my Turb. Account is canceled!</p>
<p>And I can log in via Trustly!</p>
<p>Despite always sending screenshots of the problem, the answers do not go into it at all!</p>
<p>You could think naively if I can first log in, the money could be in my casino account!</p>
<p>I suspected that this is unfortunately not the case, as is clear from the casino's approach!</p>
<p>With best regards</p>
