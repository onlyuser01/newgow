    <h1>Casino South Bend Casino 66 New Mexico Meskwaki Bingo Casino Hotel Hotels In Deadwood Sd With Casino</h1>

<p>The Swedish esports data powerhouse has obtained a license in its home country to provide local operators with various solutions used by esports bookmakers</p>
<p>The new license will allow Abios to deliver its products freely and compliantly in the regulated gambling market in the country, as part of a new regulatory regime that will see the national watchdog, Spelinspektionen, harness new monitoring and supervisory powers.</p>
<p>Abios specializes in the delivery of widgets that are powered by data about team records, odds, live scores, statistics, and more. The company provides comprehensive data about League of Legends, Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Valorant, and is constantly looking to expand its offer by featuring new games.</p>
<p>The business-to-business supplier license obtained by Abios will see the company deliver on these solutions over the next five years and support regulated brands’ expansion in the market as they seek to harness the potential of the esports vertical. The license arrives just a little less than a month ahead of a planned overhaul of the regime that will be in force from July 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Abios has been one of the most prominent data companies in the esports landscape, supplying partners with robust data and odds that help them steer their esports betting decisions. The company’s CEO and founder, Oskar Fröberg, welcomed the opportunity and said:</p>
<p>Being a company born and bred in Stockholm, we’re happy to acquire a B2B permit in Sweden and continue servicing our clients. Abios CEO and founder, Oskar Fröberg</p>
<p>Reregulation Designed to Protect Consumers</p>
<p>Fröberg added that the company’s core mission was to ensure sustainable growth in the regulated esports betting market and work with licensed operators that share that goal and ambition.</p>
<p>Abios is committed to providing partners with high-quality content that can help them access some of the best markets for popular video games such as League of Legends, Valorant, Dota 2 and Counter-Strike, as previously noted. The company also offers Rainbow Six: Siege odds and data.</p>
<p>Fröberg emphasized the importance of working with regulated sportsbooks above all else and ensuring that consumers are aware of the licensure of an esports bookmaker they turn to. The reregulation of the Swedish iGaming market – including esports betting – now states that software provided by a supplier in Sweden can never be used by offshore operators and specifically to target Swedish customers.</p>
