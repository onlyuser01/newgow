    <h1>Hollywood Casino Charles Town Seven Mile Casino Rythm City Casino Hotel Paris Casino Windstar Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Heisenberg1337,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that underage gambling is strictly forbidden in all casino establishments, both physical and online. As a minor, you are not legally allowed to participate in gambling. According to Vavada Casino’s Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>4.1. If you are under the age of 18 or under the legal age for participating in gambling in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction applicable to you ("Eligible Age"), you may not use the services provided on the Website. By using the services available on the Website, a person who has not reached the Eligible Age violates the Website’s Terms of Use. We reserve the right to request proof of age from you at any time in order to ensure that individuals who have not reached the Eligible Age, as stipulated by the laws of the country in which they reside, do not use the services provided by the Website. The Company has full legal grounds for closing your account and/or refusing to provide services if no proof of age is provided or if the Company suspects that a person under the legal age is using the Website.</p>
<p>The rule you mentioned states the following:</p>
<p>6.5.6. If the date of birth you set in your Personal Account is not your true date of birth, no refunds of spent funds will be possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the casino's license, unfortunately, we at Casino Guru don’t deal with complaints related to licensing regulations and policies. I understand your point, but, sadly, we’re not in a position to help you. We are an independent online casino database that acts as a mediator in resolving players’ disputes. We have no authority to enforce the legality of rules.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have ever submitted documents to verify your identity at the casino? Could you please confirm you filled in your profile and provided the correct date of birth?</p>
<p>Would you be so kind and send me all the relevant communication between you and the casino so we can gather as much information as possible? My email address is veronika.l@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
