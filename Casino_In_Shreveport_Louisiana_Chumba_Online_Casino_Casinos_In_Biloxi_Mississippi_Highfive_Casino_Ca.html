    <h1>Casino In Shreveport Louisiana Chumba Online Casino Casinos In Biloxi Mississippi Highfive Casino Ca</h1>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>Thank you, NineCasino Team, for providing the information.</p>
<p>Dear Ralf,</p>
<p>I have an experience when the payment was deducted from the bank account, it was displayed in the transaction history as a debit transaction, but after rejecting the payment, it was not visible as a new payment (credited funds in the same amount), we just noticed it according to the balances, comparing balances before and after the transaction. There was a debit transaction, but no debit was made in the bank account. Another note - a bank can mark any unusual transaction as illegal, according to the bank's internal security policy. It would be good to know the reason why the bank considers the transactions illegal.</p>
<p>As the casino stated, its payment provider confirmed that these transactions are failed. Although you see these debit transactions, and you sent us the screenshots, it is not possible to see there, if the amounts were really deducted from your bank account.</p>
<p>Could you please request your bank for a deep investigation of these transactions and provide us with an official bank statement about the results? Currently, we have received only screenshots of your debit transactions from your bank account transaction history and cancelled transactions from your casino account.</p>
<p>It is possible to share the data directly here, with your response, or by sending it to branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your patience and cooperation.</p>
