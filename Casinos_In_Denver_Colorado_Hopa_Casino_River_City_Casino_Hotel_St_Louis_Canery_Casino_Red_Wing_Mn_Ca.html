<p>Cosmopolitan Las Vegas Parking Charges for Hotel Guests Become Effective Next Month</p>

<p>Cosmopolitan Las Vegas is the latest Strip resort to do away with free self-parking for casino guests. Beginning next month, the luxury resort will also begin charging parking fees for most overnight guests.</p>

<p>MGM Resorts, in May 2022, completed its acquisition of the operating rights of the Cosmopolitan through a $1.625 billion deal with private equity giant Blackstone, which owns the resort. MGM brass at the time pledged to retain the resort’s operations and “extensive and exclusive amenities.” But the casino company is seemingly backtracking on that assertion with its decision to incorporate parking charges.</p>
<p>Though the Cosmopolitan ended free self-parking for nonhotel guests in June 2021, the property continued to afford complimentary parking for overnight visitors. But beginning September 20, that amenity will no longer remain.</p>
<p>Registered hotel guests receive self-parking at no additional charge for stays that begin before 9/20/23. Registered hotel guests are subject to applicable Self-Parking rates for stays that begin on or after 9/20/23,” the resort’s website states.</p>
<p>“Identity” rewards members at the Sterling or above status will continue to receive free self-parking. MGM is implementing its loyalty program, MGM Rewards, beginning Feb. 1, 2024. MGM affords its rewards members at the Pearl or above status with free self-parking.</p>
<p>Free self-parking on the Strip, once afforded by all casinos, today is rather difficult to find. The Venetian and Palazzo last month said they, too, will terminate complimentary self-parking for all guests below the resort’s Grazie Rewards’ Premier tier later this summer.</p>
<p>Free Parking a Rarity</p>
<p>Come next month, free casino parking on the Strip will be limited to the Tropicana, Treasure Island, Casino Royale, Sahara, and Wynn/Encore. Reducing the parking amenity is yet another add-on cost that has made Sin City considerably more expensive.</p>
<p>The elimination of complimentary self-parking comes as resort fees continue to escalate. The charges significantly increase the total cost of an overnight stay.</p>
<p>For a midweek stay at the Cosmopolitan in October, the casino’s website advertises a nightly rate of $290 for October 3-5. But after the property’s $45 nightly resort fee and taxes are included, the reservation comes to $759.64 for the two nights, or $380 a night.</p>
<p>If arriving by vehicle, the guests must also pay the Cosmopolitan’s $23 per day self-parking charge (unless they have a status that earns complimentary parking). That brings the stay to $805.64.</p>
<p>Valet Rates Increase</p>
<p>It was only a decade ago that not only was self-parking complimentary, but so was valet service. The amenity was typically given to visitors of all spending levels and rewards statutes. But those days are long gone.</p>
<p>At the Cosmopolitan, valet parking costs $35 during the week and $40 on Friday through Sunday. Cosmopolitan guests with Gold status or higher receive free valet.</p>
<p>A patron must accumulate at least 20K tier points to achieve Identity Gold status. Gamblers receive one Identity point for every $2.50 wagered on slots and a point for every $6 wagered on video poker. Hotel, spa, dining, and shopping charges are rewarded with five Identity points for every dollar spent.</p>
