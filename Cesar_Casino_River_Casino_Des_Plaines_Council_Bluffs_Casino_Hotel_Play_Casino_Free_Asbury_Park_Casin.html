    <h1>Cesar Casino River Casino Des Plaines Council Bluffs Casino Hotel Play Casino Free Asbury Park Casin</h1>

<p>I have submitted a complaint to resolver and if they require any details please provide them. The following complaint has been sent:</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about an issue regarding Partycasino. I have already raised the issue with this organisation and it has not been resolved.</p>
<p>I joined party casino on 21/08/2023 and deposited £500. I requested a withdrawal of £2700 but my account was temporarily disabled. Party casino requested documents from myself which I sent. These were a official government tax credits letter, a selfie of me holding my drivers licence and ma bank card used for depositing. After over a week my account was unlocked and I spoke to an advisor online and was told my withdrawal would now be processed as i was verified. I made two more small deposits from which I won £65. After these deposits were processed I was blocked again. I was told I would need to speak to somebody on the phone as a final step to get my account unlocked once again. I did this and the gentleman on the phone asked me questions all of which i answered. In an email i had mentioned i suffer from depression and anxiety. This is due to the passing of a close friend recently. The gentleman started asking if i am on medication etc. I told him i was not as it was due to a recent death. He was being very patronizing over the phone. I was told by this gentleman that Asim Iqbal who lives at the same address also used to have an account. I told him this is my husband and he had many accounts with online casinos so he most likely would have had one within the party casino label. I was told he did have an account within the brand label and he self excluded a month ago. I am aware of this as i urged him to do it as he was out of control. I was told it was a strange 'coincidence' that I opened an account around a month after he closed his. I was also told that my husband used to play one game that I also played, which is a very popular' slot. I was told this was a strange 'coincidance' too. All my friends play that slot game. I was talked to in a patronizing way as though I was a lier. I provided my ID and all documents requested and even sent a selfie of me holding my ID. I do not understand how a casino can make assumptions without facts. After the conversation I was told I would get an email when the issue was resolved. After contacting them repeatedly for around 3 weeks I received an email showing my withdrawal receipt. This was for the total amount of my deposits which were £565. I contacted party casino again and got an email telling me that my winnings totalling £2265 had been seized due to me having another account within the same label and this goes against their terms and conditions. The only other online gambling account I have is with Mr Q and this is not within the same label. If party casino can give any proof of me having another account within their label I will happily allow them to seize my winnings because i do not have one. I am 100% sure of this. My husband may have had an account within the label in the past but I have not. I am willing to do whatever asked to prove I do not have an account with any casinos within their label. I feel party casino is using an excuse to not have to pay me.</p>
<p>As I am sure you understand, my overall experience has been extremely frustrating, and I am after a reasonable and fair response from Partycasino.</p>
