<p>The Ministry of Finance in Sweden introduced a proposal for stricter regulation of gambling ads earlier this year. Now, the Swedish gambling regulator unveiled that it is generally positive about stricter rules for advertising gambling products. Currently, similar special regulations are in place for advertisements for alcohol in the country.</p>
<p>Swedish Regulator Is Generally Positive about Stricter Rules for Advertising Gambling Products</p>
<p>Spelinspektionen, the Swedish gambling regulator, announced today the response of a consultation on gambling advertising. The response reveals that Spelinspektionen is “generally positive” about the proposal for the introduction of a special requirement for advertising and marketing gambling products. The regulator explained that such regulations may boost player protection. Additionally, it said that special rules for gambling advertising may also ensure that operators are following more strictly the current requirements.</p>
<p>“The Swedish Gaming Inspectorate is generally positive about the proposal to introduce a special requirement moderation in marketing games to consumers,” reads a statement from the Spelinspektionen</p>
<p>According to Spelinspektionen, stricter advertising also aims to help prevent problem gambling or serious consequences that may arise for people who have a hard time controlling their gambling. Currently, the proposal includes all games involved with real money.</p>
<p>The Strict Proposal for Gambling Ads Was Introduced Earlier This Year</p>
<p>It was back in June when the Ministry of Finance in Sweden proposed stricter gambling advertising rules. The proposal called for special moderation for gambling marketing ads. Currently, a similar special moderation for marketing materials is in effect for alcohol in Sweden. Back then, the Swedish minister of social affairs, Ardalan Shekarabi deemed gambling addiction as a “public health problem.” He outlined that gambling addiction doesn’t only impact the finances of people but also their health.</p>
<p>The proposal for special moderation for gambling ads may come into effect on July 1, 2022. Now, considering the “generally positive” response of Spelinspektionen, the new rule may become the latest addition to the already well-regulated market in the country. With that in mind, there is still time for responses for the proposed regulation to be collected by October 14, 2021.</p>
<p>Spelinspektionen Introduces a Guide for Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>Besides its pitch for the proposed stricter gambling ad rules, the regulator unveiled a guide describing the operator’s “duty of care” within the Gambling Act. Spelinspektionen said that any operator licensed for gambling must ensure that “social and health considerations are observed in the gambling business.”</p>
<p>Within its guide, the regulator explains what measures are operators expected to take when noticing problem gambling. Additionally, the guidelines provide examples of how excessive gambling can be identified.</p>
