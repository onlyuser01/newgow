<p>Sportsbet.io has expanded on a one-year digital partnership with Brazilian soccer club Flamengo to include the blockchain company’s logo displayed on players’ shirts.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io Launches Shirt Partnership with Flamengo</p>
<p>Blockchain betting operator and sponsor of CONIFA 2019 Cup Sportsbet.io has expanded its clout in soccer by teaming up with Brazilian soccer club Flamengo. As a result, Sportsbet.io is now the official shirt sponsor of the team all through 2020. No financial details about the deal were revealed.</p>
<p>Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, better known as simply Flamengo, has noted that this is the largest shirt deal in its history. Moving forward, Sportsbet.io’s logo will be fully displayed on players’ shirts. Flamengo will add the logo by the end of October.</p>
<p>The main focus of the partnership will be social media activations that will hopefully allow Sportsbet.io to become a better-recognized brand among traditional sports fans. Sportsbet.io uses a number of cryptocurrencies – most recently adding TRON (TRX) – as well as FIAT substitutes, to allow sports enthusiasts to place wagers.</p>
<p>Reactions to the Partnership</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, Sportsbet.io CEO Tim Heath said the following:</p>
<p>“We are incredibly proud to be a global partner of Flamengo, which is no doubt, the biggest club in Brazilian football. Starting our relationship as a Digital and Media Partner in 2019, it was a simple decision to take our sponsorship to the next level, and have our logo on the famous red and black shirt. Flamengo’s professionalism, both on and off the field, makes them a pleasure to work with and we are certainly looking forward to expanding our relationship with them in the years to come.”</p>
<p>He was joined by Flamengo president Rodolfo Landim who added: “We are extremely pleased with the performance and professionalism of our partners at Sportsbet.io, so are thrilled to strengthen our relationship with this new sponsorship. As ever, I would like to thank our passionate supporters, the Nação Rubro-Negra, whose wonderful support makes partnerships that strengthen our club possible. I am sure they will enjoy trying out the Sportsbet.io platform.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, the companies have not yet revealed the news on social media, which is the main objective of the partnership. Flamengo and Sportsbet.io first signed back in July 2018.</p>
<p>More Sports Partnerships for Sportsbet.io</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io has sought to establish closer ties with familiar faces in the world of sports. The blockchain betting agency is an official sponsor to Watford, an English Premier League (EPL) team. Similarly, the company revealed an official sponsorship for CONIFA 2019 European Football Cup in February 2019.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io has focused on soccer as one of the most popular sports that naturally receive the most attention from sports fans. Earlier in October, the company teamed up with Rosario Central, an Argentine Super League soccer club.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io has agreed to develop a mobile-friendly app that would help to boost the club’s advertising opportunities and presence online.</p>
