<p>Rivalry Corp. has announced that it is continuing to build up its momentum in the casino vertical. The company, which originally launched as a fully-fledged esports betting website, has gradually transferred its know-how for appealing to modern generations of gamblers to other verticals such as sports betting and casino games.</p>
<p>Now, the company has announced the further expansion of its Casino.exe product, which will now feature eight new titles, including Blackjack, Roulette, Baccarat, and more. Rivalry is confident that this move would allow the company to strengthen its overall presence in gambling and diversify its revenue streams.</p>
<p>While sports and esports are marked by seasonability, and mostly tied to big events in the respective verticals, casinos tend to be busy round the clock, which is precisely why Rivalry is looking to expand into the segment. The announcement was commented on by company CEO and Co-Founder Steven Salz, a known face in the industry.</p>
<p>Salz said that the latest business expansion is part of a strategy whereby the company promotes "profitable customer unit economics." The executives also had this to add: "We anticipate this extension of our casino offering will further grow revenue potential and drive sustained engagement amongst our users with a curated list of games geared for our demographic."</p>
<p>Rivalry has been doing well insofar as its casino vertical has been concerned. The debut title, Aviator, was introduced in the summer of 2022. By November, the company already had great results driven by the vertical, and the company has reported that the Q3 2022 results were stronger than expected owing to the casino segment which contributed 30% of the total revenue.</p>
<p>The company noted that it had put very little effort into making its online casino products known across the market, relying on the segmentâ€™s natural appeal to gamblers instead. The pursuit of growth across the online casino landscape is not self-serving, either.</p>
<p>Salz is confident that the product Rivalry is working to actively introduce in the casino vertical is designed to specifically cater to what the executive has described as a "core demographic of users" for the company.</p>
<p>Rivalry is also determined to continue growing its Casino.exe product as it seeks to innovate and push the boundaries of its iGaming product and introduce innovation through Aviator, Rushlane, and other worthwhile games and products.</p>
