    <h1>Online Casino Betting Kentucky Casinos Skyline Hotel Casino Henderson Nv Casino In Bethlehem Pa Draf</h1>

<p>Hello dear team!</p>
<p>I deposited â‚¬20 on Bitdreams on March 20th, 2023 with the bonus code BIG300 and received a 300% bonus including 100 free spins. I then actually had a lucky streak, met the wagering requirements relatively quickly and finally applied for a win of â‚¬4000 as a payout. Of course I have read the bonus conditions because it has happened to me at other casinos that I have to bet the maximum, e.g. had exceeded and thus my profit was void.</p>
<p>I was asked to submit all the necessary documents for verification, all of which have now been approved.</p>
<p>Then the next day I get an email from Bitdreams that my entire winnings have been confiscated due to "irregular betting behavior"!ðŸ˜³ and my balance has been capped at â‚¬100 (this is the sum of my total deposits to date)</p>
<ol>
<li>Unusual Wagering</li>
</ol>
<p>Winnings will be withdrawn if a player violates one or more of the following conditions:</p>
<p>Players are not allowed to change the bet more than 3 times in one game session.</p>
<p>The bet of the next spins cannot be higher than 10 times the bet of the previous spin within the same game session.</p>
<p>Ost such a rule regarding change of mission allowed? Not being allowed to make more than 3 changes?</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I didn't violate the second point.</p>
<p>I was blown away because I had never heard this rule in any casino before. I got the same email as an answer to my email and questions, only this time in German. I then wrote to support and asked them to send me the game history, again had to send my deposit as confirmation and am now waiting for this listing.</p>
<p>Had to confirm my credit card again and asked to pay out the â‚¬100, then my account was blocked, I couldn't open any more games, but I could still log in. An employee in the chat told me that this restriction was only temporary, I then applied for my payout via PayViaBank, i.e. immediate transfer, I was assured again in the chat that I would have the â‚¬100 in my account within a few hours. Now I wanted to log in again and see the processing status, suddenly my account was completely deactivated and I can no longer get in! I wrote to the chat, the answer this time was very short and sweet that it is a decision of the admin and that decision is final, until then the communication was really respectful and nice, but until now I have no reason no answer..</p>
<p>I really think it's disgusting how I'm being treated here. I'm sure I'm not the only one who loses a win because of this "hidden" rule, I actually found it in the terms and conditions as the very last point. In my opinion, this condition is anything but fair and is apparently used to avert large profits.</p>
<p>I really hope, dear team, that you can help me here. And possibly also write these unfair conditions in your rating, so that nobody thinks of this scam anymore.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your support!</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
