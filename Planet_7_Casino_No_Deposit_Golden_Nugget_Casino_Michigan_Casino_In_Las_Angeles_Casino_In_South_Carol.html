    <h1>Planet 7 Casino No Deposit Golden Nugget Casino Michigan Casino In Las Angeles Casino In South Carol</h1>

<p>Establishing its footprint as the leading sports betting platform in the Philippines, Jade SportsBet is looking to expand its clout in the region and offer new ways to engage with customers and retain fans. To achieve this, Jade SportsBet is taking stock of its current offer and focusing on providing a growing customer base with better options in 2022.</p>
<p>Constantly Improving on Sports Betting Experience</p>
<p>The company is presently focusing on the ongoing NBA season, which offers improved margins and a new free-to-play platform that will allow players to join and explore a variety of basketball mini-games. Those games are designed to boost engagement and give recreational betting customers a sense of purpose and progress.</p>
<p>In anticipation of more betting contests, Jade SportsBet has also introduced the “Multiboost” feature that will incentivize players into making more selections and building their bet slips up for the chance to snatch additional winnings.</p>
<p>The company offers reactive prices on pre-game and in-play contests for sports such as soccer, tennis, basketball, and boxing, which have proven to be the most popular sports in the region. Commenting on these developments, Jade SportsBet CEO and founder Joe Pisano said:</p>
<p>“These are just a few of the many promotions and bonuses that Jade SportsBet have prepared this year. We are also planning to roll out more entertaining exotic jackpots, something new to the Philippines and to watch out for.” Jade SportsBet CEO and founder Joe Pisano</p>
<p>The company operates as a legitimate gambling operator and holds the necessary license approval by PAGCOR. Jade SportsBet is operated by Jade Entertainment and is a GLI-certified platform, which now allows customers to benefit from a variety of land-based and online betting options for a true 360-degree experience that grants sports fans complete freedom in making their selections and betting choices.</p>
<p>Jade Entertainment Has Big Plans for Asia</p>
<p>In 2021, Pisano said that the company was thrilled to see PAGCOR clear Jade SportsBet for launch in the highly-promising Philippine’s sports betting market. Jade Entertainment has been equally committed to maintaining a strong presence in the online betting segment and continuing to support its retail operations.</p>
<p>The rollout of the free-to-play games and Multiboost feature comes when demand for quality sports betting solutions continues to increase in the Philippines. In terms of maturity, the country is the most developed market in Asia, allowing companies to pursue a variety of products and bring many socially-responsible sports betting solutions to local sports fans. Jade Entertainment is also pivoting towards the Indian sports betting market with Lucky Yeti.</p>
