<p>KatsCasino: dishonest Casino</p>
<p>I am a loyal and honest player who enjoys playing online casino games. I registered with Kats Casino, a website that claims to be licensed and fair, and made a deposit without any issues. However, things changed when I won some money and requested a withdrawal.</p>
<p>The casino asked me to provide various documents to verify my identity and address, which I did without any hesitation. However, they kept asking for more documents, or claimed that the ones I sent were not clear. I was finally able to satisfy all the required documentation for the completion of the KYC process. However, they also said my address on my documents did not match the one on my account. They refused to change it, even though I showed them legit proof of address change.</p>
<p>They told me that they would not process my withdrawal or change my address unless I zeroed out the balance in my account, which I found very suspicious and unfair. I tried to contact them several times, and asked them to explain why they are not honoring their own rules and policies, but they either ignored me or gave me vague and contradictory answers.</p>
<p>I felt cheated and frustrated by the casino, as they have violated their own terms and conditions, which allows players to promptly update their profile information at any time which doesn’t involve having to zero out a users balance but rather for completing a transaction or withdrawal. Yet, nothing has been resolved and my dispute with the casino is ongoing. I haven’t been compensated for my winnings nor has my address on my Kats Casino profile been changed to my current address. That is why I decided to file a complaint with Casino Guru, a reputable online casino mediator.</p>
<p>I want to share my story with other players, so that they can be aware of the unfair and shady practices of Kats Casino, and avoid playing there. I also want to warn other casinos that treat their players unfairly, that they will not get away with it, and that they will face consequences for their actions.</p>
