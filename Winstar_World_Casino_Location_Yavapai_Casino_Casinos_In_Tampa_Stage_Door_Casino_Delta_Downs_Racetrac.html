<p>The Washington Commanders started the 2022 NFL season with a win, which wasn’t surprising considering that they played against the Jacksonville Jaguars, one of the worst teams in the league. The Detroit Lions lost their first game of the season to the favored Philadelphia Eagles; however, a surprise did happen in that game as well.</p>
<p>The Lions lost by just a field goal, covering the spread along the way. As a reminder, the point spread in that game was set to six points. In Week 2, oddsmakers see the Lions as the favorites, with a -1.5-point spread.</p>

<p>Carson Wentz in the Spotlight</p>
<p>Quarterback Carson Wentz started the Washington Commanders chapter of his career with a fantastic display against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He threw 27-for-41 for 313 yards and four touchdowns. Jahan Dotson caught two of those TD passes, while Terry McLaurin and Custis Samuel caught the other two.</p>
<p>Wentz didn’t get sacked in Week 1, but two of his throws did get intercepted. This is sort of surprising because Wentz had only seven interceptions in total last season when he played 17 games for the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions Look (Surprisingly) Good in the Offense</p>
<p>The Lions are coming off a 38-35 loss to the Eagles in Week 1, which saw their quarterback Jared Goff throw 21-for-37 for 215 yards and two touchdowns, with one of his passes getting intercepted. He did okay, but the reason why Detroit scored so many points in the first week of the NFL is that their running game was fantastic.</p>
<p>Running back Jamaal Williams was fantastic against the Eagles, carrying the ball 11 times for 28 yards and two touchdowns. His colleague D’Andre Swift scored one TD, but he made 15 carries for 144 yards. Swift did pick an injury in that game, but according to recent reports, he should be fit enough to play in Week 2.</p>
<p>Washington Commanders vs Detroit Lions Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams look great in the offense, which is why we expect to see plenty of points on Sunday. The team we think will score more is Washington. It’s not just because the Commanders have a great QB to dictate their passing game; it’s also because their defenders should be able to prevent the Lions from scoring too many TDs.</p>
<p>Picks: Washington Commanders to win; over to hit</p>
