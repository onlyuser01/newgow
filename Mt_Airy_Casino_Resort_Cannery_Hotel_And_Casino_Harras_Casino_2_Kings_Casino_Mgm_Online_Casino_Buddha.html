<p>Find out all you need to know about the theme, storyline, graphics, bonuses, game features, gameplay, and more from our comprehensive review covering this slot.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Exploring Buddhism</p>
<p>Encapsulating the popular Oriental theme with a focus on the popular Buddhist religion and its specific elements, the 2020-released slot introduces players to a magical, spellbinding backdrop. This dreamlike game has a fairytale atmosphere where players feel soothed and calm. The dreamy realm is packed with disruptive and electrifying elements that show up during gameplay to signal players’ good fortune.</p>
<p>The action takes place in the Ancient East in mystical foothills that are nicely embedded into the background. The premium design features beautiful pink cherry blossom trees intertwined with the reels, accompanied by subtle images of mountainous regions with beautiful forests and a sprawling countryside seen in the distance.</p>
<p>The floating fireflies complete the relaxing graphics that are predominantly colored in purple, creating an overall mystical feel that perfectly matches the Eastern theme. The grinning Buddha statue and the lion fortune symbols are both made of gold, while the blue yin/yang symbols are seen glowing off the grid in a mesmerizing manner. The graphics chosen by Booongo for this game make it stand out from its competitors with similar Oriental themes.</p>
<p>Buddha Fortune: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Js, Qs, Ks, As, green fish symbols, blue dragons, purple Phoenix birds, red lions, laughing Buddha statues, and yin/yang logos are the main symbols seen popping on the reels. The bets start at 0.25 and they can be increased up to 25. The golden Buddha symbols represent the wild and they are the highest-paying symbols that pay out x12 for five-of-a-kind. Five red lion symbols bring an x10 payout, while five purple birds trigger an x8 payout.</p>
<p>Matching five blue dragon symbols will bring players a win of x6 while coming across five identical green fish symbols will trigger an x4 win. The blue yin/yang symbol represents the scatter in the game. It pops on all the reels and it is lucrative in combinations of six symbols. When less than six yin/yang symbols are seen on the reels, they will act as a blocker and take over those reel positions that could be occupied by symbols that would pay.</p>
<p>The game counts 25 fixed pay lines in total for a maximum win capped at x2000.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The eye-catching theme with loads of designs and decorations inspired by the Chinese tradition features a relaxing music accompaniment that perfectly matches the overall aesthetics. The soundtrack has been cleverly chosen to set up the theme and action on the grid.</p>
<p>Buddha Fortune Gameplay</p>
<p>Before they start spinning the Buddha Fortune Hold and Win reels, players need to click the round, white “i” tab in the top right hand. This will launch the slot’s menu where players will come across all the necessary information regarding the paytable, the configuration of the pay lines, and the available bonus features.</p>
<p>The left and right arrows will help players easily scroll through the information. The Common Rules section will display additional game mechanics information. To place a bet, players need to use the +/- buttons located at the button right. They are also given the chance to opt for the Turbo spin alternative represented by the fast forward button for quicker action on the grid.</p>
<p>Automatic spins are also available by clicking or tapping the Autoplay button located beneath the green Spin button. Players can continue to spin the reels for as long as they want. We could not find any options that would allow us to limit the win and loss amounts during Autoplay mode.</p>
<p>Buddha Fortune Hold and Win: Bonus Game, Jackpots &amp; Mystery Symbols</p>
<p>The bonuses are rather simple to unlock and trigger. Here is a detailed description of the way they work:</p>
<p>Bonus Game</p>
<p>To activate the Bonus Game, players must come across a minimum of six bonus symbols represented by the blue yin/yang symbols. These are sticky symbols that trigger three respins. The blue symbols are also the only symbols that will show on the grid once the Bonus Game is activated. The yin-yang orbs can take on multipliers with values ranging from x1 to x19, to x12, x14, and x16 the total bet. Each new orb symbol popping on the reels will reset the number of respins to three. Players are allowed to spin up to a total of 15 times or until all the positions on the reels have been successfully filled with one of the yin-yang orbs.</p>
<p>Jackpots</p>
<p>Players can hit one of the three available jackpots: mini, minor, and grand. All jackpots can be won while engaged in the Bonus Game. Seeing Mini bonus symbols (blue yin/yang orbs) appear randomly while playing the Bonus Game will trigger the Mini jackpot. This jackpot pays</p>
<p>x20 total bet.</p>
<p>To grab the Minor jackpot, players must keep an eye on the minor orb symbols during the Bonus Game. The Minor jackpot pays x50 total bet. Players who manage to collect all 15 bonus orbs symbols will enjoy the massive x2000 grand jackpot.</p>
<p>Mystery Symbols</p>
<p>Mystery symbols showing up during the Bonus Game can turn into Mini and Minor symbols or they can bring players two to four extra respins when the extra respin symbol is seen. When additional extra respin symbols pop up, the total number of additional spins is added.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With three different jackpots up for grabs and plenty of lucrative features engaged during the Bonus Game, a mesmerizing Buddhist setting with a dreamy feel, Buddha Fortune Hold and Win is a “must-play” for slot aficionados who love the Oriental theme.</p>
