<p>Pragmatic Play, a leading supplier of content to the online casino industry, has revitalized one of its best games, Gates of Olympus, launching a new version called Gates of Olympus 1000. According to the company, the enhanced title “opens the gates to even greater win potential.”</p>
<p>Gates of Olympus 1000 Metrics</p>
<p>Rows: 5</p>
<p>Reels: 6</p>
<p>Paylines: Symbols pay anywhere on the board</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>RTP: 96.5% / 95.51% / 94.5%</p>
<p>Min/Max bet: 0.20/125</p>
<p>Max Win: 15,000x</p>
<p>Zeus Returns to Make Players Rich</p>
<p>As the title suggests, Gates of Olympus 1000 is another Greek mythology-inspired game, adding to Pragmatic Play’s portfolio of thematic titles. The new game expands on symbols and mechanics players are already familiar with, while allowing players to win even bigger prizes.</p>
<p>When playing Gates of Olympus 1000, players will collect a variety of symbols, including crowns, gems and goblets. Zeus himself serves as a Scatter symbol, allowing players to trigger the bonus game.</p>
<p>Instead of using paylines, the 6×5 slot allows symbols to pay anywhere on the screen, as long as players collect 8 or more of them. In the meantime, Zeus, who stands alongside the reels, can randomly strike his thunderbolt, awarding random multipliers from 2x to 1,000x.</p>
<p>The game also features a tumble mechanic whereby winning symbols would disappear from the reels and get replaced by new symbols, allowing players to potentially score multiple wins per spin.</p>
<p>The New Game Is a Striking Sequel</p>
<p>Collecting four or more of the aforementioned Zeus Scatter symbols will provide players with 15 free spins. During this bonus game, any multiplier that hits on a winning spin is added to the total multiplier, allowing players to win big.</p>
<p>In addition, landing on four more Zeus symbols during the bonus game will retrigger the feature, providing players with a shot at even bigger prizes. Speaking of winning big, the game allows players to win up to 15,000x their bet.</p>
<p>Gates of Olympus 1000 builds on the popularity of an already popular game, leveraging the beloved Greek theme to engage iGaming enthusiasts. For reference, Pragmatic Play’s Greek mythology-themed franchise was recently enhanced with the addition of games such as Wisdom of Athena and Zeus vs Hades – Gods of War.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, Irina Cornides, commented on the new release, announcing the spectacular return of Zeus in this “striking sequel.”</p>
<p>Gates of Olympus 1000 takes one of Pragmatic Play’s most popular and successful Slots ever and massively boosts its win potential, introducing a mighty 15,000x max win. Irina Cornides, COO, Pragmatic Play</p>
