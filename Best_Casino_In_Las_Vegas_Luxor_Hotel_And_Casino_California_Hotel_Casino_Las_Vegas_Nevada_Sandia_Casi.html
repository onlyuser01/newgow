    <h1>Best Casino In Las Vegas Luxor Hotel And Casino California Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nevada Sandia Casi</h1>

<p>The developer of outstanding games for the iGaming sector, Play’n GO, has hailed the results of its most recent month, with December proving the most accomplished month on record for the company. This achievement is doubly important given the company’s decades-long history in the iGaming sector, and as the author of some of the most recognizable names in the sector, among which are Book of Dead and Reactoonz.</p>
<p>Now, though, the company has seen an even stronger uptake in product adoption and player interest, not least spearheaded by the company’s entry into the United States and its expansion locally, along with the rollout of prominent and much-anticipated products such as Piggy Blitz and Gargantoonz.</p>
<p>Both the number of daily active players and the overall gross gaming revenue for the company grew significantly during the month of December, not least because of the rather busier holiday season for operators.</p>
<p>Play’n GO CEO and Co-founder Johan Törnqvist has hailed the results and celebrated his company’s achievement, touting the hard work that went into creating the supplier’s juggernaut over the past months and years.</p>
<p>"I’m immensely proud of the entire team today. It’s a testament to the hard work and dedication of everyone in the business that we can continue to grow and break our own lofty records," the executive added.</p>
<p>He argued that December was indeed a great month for the company, bolstered by its appetite for innovation and dedication. Törnqvist confirmed that Play’n GO is on a path to solid and sustainable growth and that the entire company was now looking towards the rest of 2024 with a mix of trepidation and excitement.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has already released its first game for the year with Pandastic Adventure focusing on the beloved character of Kung Fu Panda, which has no relation to the movie.</p>
<p>The company has also been navigating interesting markets by arranging worthwhile and important partnerships with well-represented local players, including with BetMGM with whom Play’n GO launched its Piggy Blitz title as an exclusive option.</p>
<p>Play’n GO also closed last week with an even fresher release, introducing players to 3 Clown Monty II, a mix of carnival excitement and subtle horror. As to the exact results of December, Play’n GO has preferred to keep mum about the specific figures for the time being.</p>
