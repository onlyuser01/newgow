    <h1>Casino Ballroom Hampton Nh Fire Keeper Casino Victoryland Casino Wild Rose Casino Clinton New Casino</h1>

<p>Gaming Corps will supply SuprNation with games such as Coin Miner, Jet Lucky 2, Paddy’s Payout and Wild Woof</p>
<p>A week after injecting content into Pin-UP Casino, Gaming Corps, an up-and-coming Swedish developer of gambling content, signed a new deal with SuprNation. Under the agreement with the international operator, Gaming Corps will power three of its brands with content.</p>
<p>As per the deal, the supplier will leverage its rich portfolio of iGaming titles to bolster the content offering of the VoodooDreams, NYspins and Duelz brands. As a result, SuprNation’s players will get to experience a rich selection of crash games, table games, slots and Plinko.</p>
<p>Some of the most notable titles that will go live with the three brands include games such as Coin Miner, Jet Lucky 2, Paddy’s Payout and Wild Woof.</p>
<p>SuprNation holds licenses in Sweden, Malta, the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man. By partnering with the operator, Gaming Corps will be able to greatly expand its European footprint and reach more players than ever before.</p>
<p>The agreement follows an aggregation arrangement between Gaming Corps and Infingame. Prior to that, the supplier penned a similar deal with Uplatform.</p>
<p>The Content Is a Welcome Addition to the SuprNation Offering</p>
<p>Gaming Corps’ chief commercial officer, Danielle Calafato, commented on the partnership, praising SuprNation for the strong impact it has had on the gaming industry. Calafato lauded the operator’s team for its creativity and ambition and said that Gaming Corps is excited to inject content into its brands.</p>
<p>We are continuing to bring our games suite to more and more players and I look forward to giving SuprNation’s players the chance to enjoy our growing number of successful titles. Danielle Calafato, CCO, Gaming Corps</p>
<p>Laura Makkonen, SurpNation’s casino games manager, echoed Calafato’s sentiments, saying that she is very excited about the deal. She noted that her team “consistently strives” to provide “the most engaging and thrilling casino content available in the market” to its players.</p>
<p>To that end, SuprNation decided to team up with Gaming Corps, which boasts a strong portfolio of gaming content.</p>
<p>I am enthusiastic about this collaboration and am confident that the suite of games from Gaming Corps will further enhance our offerings. Laura Makkonen, casino games manager, SuprNation</p>
<p>In January, the social gaming company DoubleDown Interactive announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire SuprNation in a $33 million all-cash deal.</p>
