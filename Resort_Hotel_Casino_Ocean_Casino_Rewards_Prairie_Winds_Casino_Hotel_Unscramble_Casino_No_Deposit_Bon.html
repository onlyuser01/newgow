<p>If the weather outside is frightful, some would argue that Aztec Fire 2 by 3 Oaks Gaming is so delightful. This inept interjection aside, 3 Oaks Gaming has indeed closed the year with a brand new game, Aztec Fire 2 Hold and Win Multi, which is designed to bring back the popular Mexican adventure theme and introduce a few cool features along the way, not least the Unlockable Rows that build the anticipation, and possibly the rewards, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>The new game plays across a five-by-four reel and players will try to make the most out of the built-in features, such as a Hold &amp; Win bonus round, which is triggered when you collect six Bonus Symbols. Ten Bonus Symbols, however, will add the fifth row, but it doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p>If you have 15 Bonus Symbols, you will get a sixth row, 20 and you will add a seventh. There is a lot of ways to expand the grid, which is where the Unlockable Rows come in! Plus, there is a 10x multiplier that will apply and make sure that you are getting the most out of this intuitive experience.</p>
<p>Plus, you also stand a chance to land the Royal Jackpot which could lead to a massive 10,000x payout based on your stake. This is a lot, and it’s a nice way to liven up the spirits when playing Aztec Fire 2. Players will get to enjoy free spins but also benefit from the Bonus Accum Mechanic, which is another fantastic opportunity for everyone to enjoy their time with this 3 Oaks Gaming product even more.</p>
<p>Speaking of 3 Oaks Gaming, the company has had an exciting roadmap punctuated by many new releases and an overwhelming commitment to building a robust library that delivers on all levels.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming Chief Business Development Officer Yuriy Muratov said that Aztec Fire 2 was indeed a worthy continuation of the original game, and the addition of the Unlockable Rows truly gave it some of that extra vim that players tend to enjoy so much.</p>
<p>"This slot takes players on a breathtaking jungle journey where they can uncover modifiers and six in-game jackpots, rounding off our 2023 games roadmap in style," Muratov said, putting a full stop to a whole year filled of innovative imprimatur.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming has had an interesting year indeed, releasing other popular titles such as Crystal Scarabs: Hold and Win and Grab More Gold!</p>
