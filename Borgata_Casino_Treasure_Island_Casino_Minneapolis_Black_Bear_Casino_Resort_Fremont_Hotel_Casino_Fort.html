    <h1>Borgata Casino Treasure Island Casino Minneapolis Black Bear Casino Resort Fremont Hotel Casino Fort</h1>

<p>I have been a member of superslots for over 2 months. Over this period of time i have spent thousands of dollars there. I like the way they separate the bonus sections from the regular play. At first I had no issues. Then I started to lose access to my bonus play. The normal bonus section has less games normally , but all of a sudden more than half the bonus games were gone. And the ones that were there, I was unable to play other than 1-5 games. I directed my grievance toward one of their agents and they let me know they see the problem and they will reset it. They reset it and it worked fine. Then at some point over a month ago, it stopped working again. This time they wouldn’t fix it. They would just send me to troubleshooting. I’ve already done all that. Cleared cache and cookies, changed devices and browsers. Nothing worked. I would only be able to play anywhere from 1-5 games and of course had no chance in rolling over my cash that way. I’ve spent hours putting together videos and photos for them and they wouldn’t return the bonus for me. I wasn’t even trying to withdrawal money. I just wanted to play. They wouldn’t do it. Tonight was the last straw. I had 5 games to choose from. (Everyone else has 77 according to management i spoke to). Well I was 400 bucks from rolling over, I chose "spin to ride" and after spending 400 I had 300 bucks left over. It didn’t ding or message me though. So I though, I must be spins away. So I kept spinning it down until I realized I just spent another 300 roughly. I panicked and backed out and went to my account. They never gave me any rollover points for spin to ride. When I told them, they said it doesn’t count toward rollover because there’s a progressive. (Terrible progressive btw: 1,000 dollar jackpot but you have to do max bet (150 dollars). Why would you put that game in the bonus section if it doesn’t count toward bonus play? And it’s one of the only5 games that works for me and everyone else gets 77 games. I was so fed up. Left there for good. I have sent them videos and photos and they do nothing. They offered me 25 dollars. Hah. Such bs. I’ve spent over 20 grand between there and wildcasino in the past 10 weeks.</p>
<p>Side note: Almost every single charge I was overcharged between 5-25%. It took me weeks and countless hours but they finally credited my account with that money. They didn’t pay for all those foreign transactions I didn’t want though. Nor address the fact that the overcharges took me over my limit and gave me fees from my bank. They don’t care. They said "oh but we gave it back to you". They wouldn’t even let me withdrawal it. They said I had to wait a week even though these charges can be from weeks ago.</p>
<p>And finally I have video evidence of their slots not NOT paying when something lands on a payline. So many times I could have sworn I watched something big hit and I didn’t get pay. And yes, I go into the pay table and check which lines are used for the games. So glad I hit record when I watched a bunch of hits not register. I was playing Gold Heist. Pretty volatile game so it can be common to not have too many good hits. But right off the bat 2-3 spins in I get the 20 free spins. Not a single hit for all of those. Ok strange. Kept playing another 100 spins and I had 4 small hits when I swear I thought I saw paylines</p>
<p>hit. That’s when I hit record and got it on video. Only one payline that I know of was working and the rest were not. That game has 30 Pauline’s and I watched as 3 Jacks hit payline number 27 with no recorded pay. They don’t have an option in that game to change how many Paylines you want, I checked. 15-20 grand gone from this site. Not one withdrawal.</p>
