    <h1>Casino City Kicks Casino Palms Casino And Resort Blaze Casino Scam Horseshoe Casino Indiana TrustDic</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I spoke with Trustdice live support on 11th February to explain I have a brain injury which makes me impulsive and it has caused me to make transactions I can't afford. I asked if they can refund my deposits and immediately close my account. The refunds were rejected but they did not close my account. After this they accepted a further 5 deposits from me. They gave still not closed my account to this day and I deem them liable for the further 5 crypto deposits after I requested the account to be closed. It states on there terms that I can speak to live support who can activate account closure but it was never done. They are trying to say that I should use the self exclusion tool but as a casino who promotes responsible Gambling they should closed my account when I requested the help.</p>
<p>I have attached the conversations, the terms and also the 5 deposits that were made after my conversation on 11th February.</p>
<p>To resolve this matter I would like the 5 deposits to be refunded please and my account to be closed immediately.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
