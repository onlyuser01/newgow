    <h1>Bitcoin Live Casino Cashman Casino Free Casino Night Attire South Point Casino Bingo Casino Nashvill</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I've made multiple deposits at this casino and have yet to withdraw or make any significant winnings</p>
<p>On the 4th of August, 2023, a casino representative named Mirko offered me a bonus through WhatsApp.</p>
<p>I opened my account to find a 30€ bonus with an x15 wager.</p>
<p>There was no maximum withdrawal limit</p>
<p>Not many details were provided beyond the playthrough timeframe.</p>
<p>I was fortunate and even had a decent winning, almost fulfilling the bonus conditions with 620€ in my account.</p>
<p>But after completing the bonus, 420€ disappeared from my balance</p>
<p>I was left with only 200€.</p>
<p>The game history from the 4th of August, 2023 isn't complete, and doesn't show the final part pertaining to the bonus.</p>
<p>I contacted the casino and spoke with Mirko about the missing 420€, which he found strange</p>
<p>He asked me to wait while he investigated the issue and promised to email me with a resolution. I spoke with him again yesterday through the casino chat and he changed his story, claiming the bonus had a withdrawal limit.</p>
<p>This isn't true.</p>
<p>I asked him to show me this limit.</p>
<p>Mirko told me he couldn't because the bonus had already been used.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>The casino doesn't provide a bonus history.</p>
<p>He hasn't been able to prove the existence of the withdrawal limit, and it's even worse that the game history isn't complete.</p>
<p>He told me he was going to address the issue, but as of today the game history remains the same</p>
<p>It is still incomplete.</p>
<p>This casino is not honest and took 420€ from me without cause</p>
<p>I will attach some screenshots for your reference.</p>
