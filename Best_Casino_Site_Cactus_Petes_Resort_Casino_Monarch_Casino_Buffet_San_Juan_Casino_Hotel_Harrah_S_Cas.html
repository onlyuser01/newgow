    <h1>Best Casino Site Cactus Petes Resort Casino Monarch Casino Buffet San Juan Casino Hotel Harrah S Cas</h1>

<p>Hello. I withdrew 1000$ on the 6th of august but the transaction has "In progress" status on my account history. Talked with fairspin through e-mail and chat and they said I have to wait up to 10 days because it is a big win and they have to do additional verification.</p>
<p>Now i'm reading the terms and conditions and they state the followings:</p>
<p>"4.3. Fairspin will carry out additional verification procedures for any payout exceeding the equivalent of 2,000.00 Euro" - i have only 1000$ so it doesn't count to this condition.</p>
<p>"5.5. Considering that You have submitted Your identification documents (if applicable), Fairspin will process Your withdrawal request. The withdrawal request processing may take from ten (10) minutes or more, if Fairspin or relevant third parties have to perform additional checks." - not my case, the withdrawl is still processing (please se attached file).</p>
<p>"5.14. Please note that funds usually will be transferred to Your external account or wallet within ten (10) banking days upon the moment (date) Fairspin has processed Your notice for withdrawal and Fairspin confirmed (approved) such withdrawal." - these are the 10 days they told me in chat and email, BUT these 10 days starts after they process my withdrawl in my account. Now the terms and conditions doesn't state how long the approval takes, so I wonder, could be months or years?</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have not withdrew a "large amount" how they state in their terms and conditions so the withdrawl should have been approved in 10 minutes like they state in condition no 5.5</p>
<p>Please give me your input here.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cristian</p>
