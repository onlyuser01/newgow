<p>Piggy Bjorn review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Piggy Bjorn is themed around a fantasy world of viking pigs.</p>
<p>Players will ride into a realm of ice, nordic magic, and warrior swine. As they learn to wield a variety of elegant weapons, they’ll begin a hunt for mythical treasure.</p>
<p>This slot is a good fit for players who are in the mood for a viking theme with a creative twist.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The epic soundtrack is infused with ethereal flute notes and a steady drum beat. The ambient sounds of horses whinnying and distant rumbles add a visceral feel to the setting.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see glowing swords, bows and arrows, shields, and a host of ruins carved into stone. This reinforces the sense that tradition and battle skills are crucial in this unforgiving world.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are crafted from wood and iron, with a mountain landscape visible in the distance. The snowy peaks are tinged with pink light suggesting sunrise.</p>
<p>The pig characters are animated in a cartoon style with fierce expressions and elaborate viking ensembles. Colorful face paint, horned helmets, and punk-rock hairstyle give these warrior hogs an intimidating aesthetic.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Piggy Bjorn create a unique fantasy world that fans of Norse culture will have fun with.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Piggy Bjorn is a five reel, four row slot with 50 win lines.</p>
<p>Wins are calculated from left to right, and only the highest win on each payline is awarded.</p>
<p>The maximum win for a session is x50,000 players’ total bet.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, Mega Scatter, Piggy Loot, and Piggy Collect symbols.</p>
<p>The Piggy Loot symbol can appear on reels 1, 2, 3, and 4 during the base game, and it carries a randomized multiplier between x1 and x20.</p>
<p>The Piggy Collect symbol lands only on reel 5 during the base game. If at least one Piggy Collect symbol lands along with a Piggy Loot symbol, the values of the Piggy Loot symbols are combined and paid out.</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Scatters, the Raid Bonus begins, as each Scatter starts the bonus with a random feature. Players will begin with up to 5 free spins, one for each triggering Scatter, with the spin count resetting each time a new symbol lands. During this feature, the reels can expand a maximum of two times if you fill them entirely.</p>
<p>If all the reels are filled with symbols in every possible position, the Raid Bonus will conclude, and players will be awarded a x500 Full Reel Bonus.</p>
<p>Mega Scatter symbols will award players the Fury Taxes symbol during the Raid Bonus. This symbol adds all visible values to its own.</p>
<p>A great variety of additional special symbols with distinct special features and multipliers are available. Some consume the values of other symbols, while others contribute their value to other symbols.</p>
<p>Players can buy directly into the bonus by selecting the Buy Bonus button.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.44%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%. This can be increased to 97.94% during the special features.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€40.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Piggy Bjorn is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We suggest a strategy of targeting the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility viking pig-themed slot.</p>
<p>With a high RTP and alluring volatility, Piggy Bjorn is a solid pick for players with a mathematical mindset.</p>
