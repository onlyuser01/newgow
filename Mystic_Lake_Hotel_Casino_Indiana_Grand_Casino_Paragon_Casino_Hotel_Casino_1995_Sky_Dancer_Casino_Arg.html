<p>Argentina‚Äôs first competitive match after winning the World Cup is on the program on Thursday, September 7, when La Albiceleste welcome Ecuador at Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires</p>
<p>Argentina might be the world soccer champion, but La Albiceleste will have to go through the qualification process, same as any other nation, to book the ticket to the 2026 World Championship. The first obstacle on that road comes in the form of Ecuador, a team they‚Äôve only lost once when Lionel Messi was on the pitch. And the loss in question happened back in 2008.</p>
<p>Argentina vs. Ecuador Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Argentina -345 Draw +425 Ecuador +1100</p>
<p>Totals Odds Over 3 -118 Under 3 +100 *Odds taken from bet365 on Wednesday, September 6.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi to Lead Argentina to a Big Win on Thursday</p>
<p>The mere fact that Lionel Messi has decided to miss the Inter Miami vs. Sporting Kansas City game shows how much he cares for his national team. His team is struggling to get to the playoff zone in the MLS, but despite that, the soccer GOAT decided to come to Buenos Aires. He will captain Argentina in the two 2026 World Cup qualifiers, the first of which is the one on Thursday against Ecuador.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that Messi is a big patriot who‚Äôs always there for his national team, but people are really wondering if Argentina needs him against such a mediocre opponent as Ecuador. Well, most probably, they would‚Äôve done okay without him, but you can think of this as a reunion of the squad that won Argentina its first World Cup since the Diego Maradona days.</p>
<p>Can Ecuador Do the Impossible on Thursday?</p>
<p>With Lionel Messi on the team, Argentina is 4-3-1 against Ecuador. The only time La Albiceleste lost to Ecuador with Messi on the pitch was almost 15 years ago. In the most recent Argentina vs. Ecuador game, however, we saw a draw happen.</p>
<p>The game in question took place in March 2022. It was 1-1 on the screen after the final whistle, even though Argentina had a 1-0 lead until the third minute of the stoppage time. However, that game was played in Ecuador, where this team usually does very well.</p>
<p>On the road, it‚Äôs a whole different story. In the qualification for the previous World Cup, Ecuador had six losses in total, five of which happened in away games.</p>
<p>Argentina vs. Ecuador Prediction</p>
<p>Argentina‚Äôs World Cup-winning players are playing a competitive game in Buenos Aires for the first time since winning the trophy in Qatar. Their fans are going to organize a warm welcome for their boys, and Messi and Co. will destroy the opposition in return.</p>
<p>Picks: Argentina to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
