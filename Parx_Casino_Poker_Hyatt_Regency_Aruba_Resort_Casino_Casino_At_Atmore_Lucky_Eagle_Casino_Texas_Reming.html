<p>Denmark's Ministry of Taxation has issued a new executive order requiring all land-based gambling businesses to register players before they can place bets</p>
<p>The order, which will take effect on October 1, 2023, aims to align the land-based and retail gambling sectors with the same know-your-customer and anti-money laundering processes that are already in place in the online gambling industry.</p>
<p>How Denmark’s New Regulations Ensure Consumer Protection</p>
<p>The executive order was put in place after the Danish government recognized the need for new approaches to gambling addiction, consumer protection, and the fight against crime. The partial liberalization and modernization of the gambling market in Denmark in 2012 served as a catalyst for this change, and the experience with the gambling market after the liberalization in 2012 continuously demonstrated the need for more measures to address these issues.</p>
<p>By requiring player registration, the anonymity of the consumer is removed, making it easier for the authorities to monitor and prevent money laundering and match-fixing activities. Additionally, this measure helps to establish a stronger link between players and gambling providers, which helps to promote responsible gambling practices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Danish gambling industry has proven to be quite robust and experiencing growth. Denmark’s full-year GGR for 2022 reached DKK6.70 billion ($978 million), a 7.5% increase compared to 2021. The retail sector saw significant gains, with land-based casinos and slot operations increasing by 59.1% and 47.5%, respectively.</p>
<p>Gambling Industry Must Step Up Responsible Gaming Measures Under Denmark’s New Rules</p>
<p>Under the new rules, players under the age of 18 and those who have opted to self-exclude from gambling activities will face additional difficulties when trying to place bets. They will also be required to set a loss limit, which is intended to aid in player protection. These measures are part of a larger effort to reduce gambling addiction in Denmark and create a safer environment for gamblers.</p>
<p>Moreover, the order has several provisions that mandate land-based operators to take responsible gambling measures. The operators must familiarize themselves with a player’s gambling patterns and step in to prevent problem gambling.</p>
<p>They must also have written internal rules and procedures on responsible gambling that aim to prevent problem gambling and addiction. According to the rules, this will include communication and control with players who demonstrate traits of problem gambling, an obligation to pay attention, record and store information about player behavior, and consumer risk assessments.</p>
<p>The businesses must also take steps to ensure that no promotional material is sent to players who have self-excluded from gambling activities. This provision is intended to prevent problem gamblers from being lured back into gambling by enticing offers.</p>
