    <h1>Harlow S Casino Inn Of The Mountain Gods Resort And Casino Walker Mn Casino Harrahs Casino Kansas Ci</h1>

<p>After using my friend's account to deposit €35 into my Platin Casino account, I won €4000. I aimed to withdraw this the next day, but I was required to verify my account again, seeing that my last withdrawal was almost two years ago (my last withdrawal was €200 also paid through a third party account). I eventually received my winnings after providing numerous requested documents such as the deposit account statement, my friend's ID, and various other documents. THIS DESPITE IT BEING A THIRD PARTY DEPOSIT!</p>
<p>I now find myself having to provide these documents all over again for the sake of confirming my account for the payout and I specifically pointed out prior to this that the deposit was made through my friend's account. I was then told that this was not a problem and that I should upload all the necessary third-party account documents, in addition to my own missing documents.</p>
<p>Two days later, after all the documents had been uploaded and cleared for review, my withdrawal was abruptly cancelled. Subsequently, I received an email stating that my account was being permanently blocked with immediate effect for breaking the terms and conditions regarding the third-party deposit. All my winnings were cancelled and the €35 that had been deposited were to be reimbursed back into the deposit account.</p>
<p>It is absolutely preposterous that "Platin Casino" allows third-party deposits just so they can line their pockets whilst players lose thousands of euros. Then, when they have to give back a little from it all and things get tough, they shut you out and suddenly you are the one who has crossed the terms and conditions. In my view and that of many other players, Platin Casino is the one overstepping the terms and conditions by willingly accepting third-party deposits without any issue. They do not even inform us that it is not our own account. Absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>We can go on depositing, continuously feeding the machine with money, but forget about getting a payout if you win anything.</p>
<p>I DEMAND MY WINNINGS BACK!</p>
