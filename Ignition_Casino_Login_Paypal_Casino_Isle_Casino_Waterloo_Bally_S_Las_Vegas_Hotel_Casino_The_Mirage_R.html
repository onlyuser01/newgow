<p>US Integrity continues to work closely with college sports and leagues in the United States as the company announced a new partnership with BIG EAST Conference designed to continue the organization’s ongoing mission of protecting the integrity of sports.</p>
<p>The partnership aims to educate student-athletes, staff, and coaches about the changing dynamics of the sports wagering landscape and the pitfalls therein for those who are closest to the action. As sports gambling becomes more readily accessible, including on a collegiate level, insiders are exposed to the dangers of placing unauthorized bets.</p>
<p>This is happening already, with the recent UNLV game against New Mexico surrounded by what has been qualified as "unusual betting activity." To ensure that the integrity of sports is guaranteed and that people who work in this sector are aware of the risks, US Integrity is providing BIG EAST officials with the organization’s dedicated monitoring software and resources.</p>
<p>US Integrity runs a detailed analysis of betting activity, which allows partners to garner insight into potentially fraudulent activities. However, US Integrity is not focusing simply on catching wrongdoers in the act.</p>
<p>The organization’s mission is equally rooted in education and prevention as well, and BIG EAST Conference will have access to the comprehensive education resources that are readily available and designed based on evidence and an effective approach towards addressing the issue.</p>
<p>US Integrity CEO and Co-Founder Matthew Holt was very pleased with the opportunity to see his company help another prominent sports organization to its ranks. Holt said:</p>
<p>"We’re excited to work with the exceptional team at the BIG EAST. All our partners are committed to the highest integrity standards, and they are no exception. These types of partnerships help ensure sports betting integrity and strengthen the unique &amp; proprietary anomaly-detection tools we have developed at US Integrity."</p>
<p>BIG EAST Commissioner Val Ackerman has welcomed the opportunity to join forces with US Integrity and benefit from the sterling service that the organizaiton provides to offer better protection across schools and deploy meaningful and targeted educational programs.</p>
<p>US Integrity is a member of the American Gaming Association’s Have A Game Plan campaign designed to help raise awareness for responsible gambling at a time of fast-evolving and expanding gambling rules.</p>
