    <h1>Online Casino Games With Real Money Border Casino Oklahoma Mohegan Casino Las Vegas Ho Chunk Wittenb</h1>

<p>Again to explain!!!!</p>
<p>I've been playing for about 7 months have deposited a lot of money from my account!!!</p>
<p>I have always paid out to my account and about 3 months ago a payout because the balance on the account was a payout DIRECTLY from Casinia to my friend's account via bank transfer!!!! Because of my gambling addiction debts!!! This went smoothly and I was able to continue playing. You wanted to have the bank details for control purposes.</p>
<p>I have always gambled in my name and on my own account!!!!!!</p>
<p>I also explained this to support and they said they'll never do this again and I said it won't happen again and that I only made the payment to my account. That settled it for me!</p>
<p>I have done my verification for my data as well id + ban card!</p>
<p>Because I play for myself !</p>
<p>No matter how it happened, I finally won after 7 months and I would like to have paid out the winnings because I had invested a lot of my money and it would have been better if I lost it.</p>
<p>They can't just CANCEL MY WINNINGS!!!!</p>
<p>I could also deposit normally via giropay and continue playing because she could have blocked it in December if it violated the terms and conditions!</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any guilt and I didn't do anything intentionally</p>
<p>I just want a reasonable solution means paying out my winnings!!!!</p>
<p>I have verified myself with id selfie and my bank details, have instructed all payments 3 x 500€ to my bank account!!!! And I would like to have my remaining balance of 2113€ on my account !!! Lost too much money due to gambling addiction</p>
<p>Thank you, I hope for a sensible solution from the admins and administration of Casinia!</p>
