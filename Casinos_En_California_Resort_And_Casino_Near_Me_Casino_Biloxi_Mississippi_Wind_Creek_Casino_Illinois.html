    <h1>Casinos En California Resort And Casino Near Me Casino Biloxi Mississippi Wind Creek Casino Illinois</h1>

<p>Thank you for your reply, gracerand31. I am sorry, but if you didn't inform the casino about your gambling problem prior to making any deposits, there is nothing we can do. GAMSTOP offers its services and cooperates only with casinos who has a UKGC license. Unfortunately, this casino doesn't have a UK license, therefore GAMSTOP cannot prevent players from registering or help with refunds.</p>
<p>If you still have access to your casino account, my only advice would be to request self-exclusion as soon as possible. When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible. I would also strongly recommend that you always save your self-exclusion request so that you have valid proof of such action.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings xxx xxx,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx (gambling problem/addiction)</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
