<p>HappyHour has announced a strategic investment in Fluid expected to help the latter speed up its AI-based expansion and revolutionize digital payments in iGaming</p>
<p>Leading investment firm with an interest in the iGaming vertical, HappyHour.io, has announced a new strategic investment in state-of-the-art, artificial intelligence-based cashier and digital wallet solution, Fluid.</p>
<p>In May, the same gaming investor announced an important investment in Betty.ca, an Ontario-based online casino brand looking to strengthen its position in its home market while penetrating new North American markets.</p>
<p>Revolutionizing Digital Payments in the iGaming Industry</p>
<p>By investing in the supplier of innovative payment technology that offers seamless integration to operators’ platforms and customized user experiences via artificial intelligence, HappyHour will further help Fluid hit the gas pedal in terms of growth and expansion.</p>
<p>Fluid’s declared goal is to completely change how digital payments are perceived by offering a “next-generation digital wallet designed to improve conversion, reduce fraud,” and delight customers starting with the iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the promising startup is already doing a good job at harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence to generate individualized user experiences which include flawless integration with operators’ brand identity and distribution of anti-fraud mechanisms for clients.</p>
<p>The latter works proactively by identifying and stopping suspicious activities while making sure that operators and users alike can complete their transactions in a safe environment with the utmost confidence that they are well protected.</p>
<p>“A Catalyst for Innovation and Growth”</p>
<p>Fluid’s chief executive officer, Roberto Rubio, took the opportunity to express enthusiasm regarding the newly inked agreement, explaining that HappyHour’s investment in Fluid has represented “a catalyst for innovation and growth.”</p>
<p>Rubio also praised HappyHours’ “deep industry knowledge” mixed together with their strategic guidance and support, all of which have proven to be essential in empowering Fluid to redefine the way digital transactions occur in the gaming world.</p>
<p>The CEO called the HappyHours team “more than just investors,” describing them as trusted partners sharing their own vision and devotion to generate the ultimate experiences for users.</p>
<p>At the same time, HappyHour’s managing partner, Robin Reed, used a similar statement to express their pride to be “a part of this journey” next to Fluid, a company that he called “poised to raise the bar” for what the world expects from for a solid digital wallet and cashier solution.</p>
<p>Reed also spoke about Fluid’s ability to create fully user-centric experiences while establishing fresh benchmarks in terms of safety and efficiency.</p>
<p>Delivered as a web component, Fluid offers in-depth user tracking and relies on advanced machine learning models that can effectively spot and counter fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, in June, HappyHour announced it would strengthen its C-suite by appointing Ben Clemes as its new investment portfolio partner.</p>
<p>The company also took the opportunity to make it known that, from his new position based in San Francisco, Clemens would be responsible for helping the company extend its connections with a variety of startups belonging to the gambling vertical.</p>
