    <h1>Casino Themed Party Rivers Casino Schenectady Grand Lisboa Casino Riviera Hotel Casino Intertops Red</h1>

<p>Casino use fraud scheme to invite players. Then they offer bonuses and scam when you do everything they ask.</p>
<p>Casino chat with me:</p>
<p>Hello! Please clarify your question.</p>
<p>last chat was deleted</p>
<p>I will do what you said in front of you</p>
<p>and I'll prove it</p>
<p>another scam from rox casino</p>
<p>80 euro deposit made</p>
<p>How can I activate the bonus now?</p>
<p>Alexanders, what kind of deception are we talking about? I previously informed you that with a deposit of 80 euros you will fulfill the condition for the amount of deposits for the week, which is necessary for the bonus to be available for the next replenishment. You need to use the funds you deposited now, after which the bonus can be credited to your next deposit.</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>Should I just deposit 200 euros now? to get 100 spins?</p>
<p>No. You need to use the deposit you have now made. After making another deposit, you can use it to activate the bonus.</p>
<p>How should I use it?</p>
<p>give instructions</p>
<p>You can use the deposit on your balance by placing bets in games. You just need to spend these funds in any way.</p>
<p>lose to 0?</p>
<p>What balance should I lose to get a chance to make a deposit with the bonus?</p>
<p>Alexanders, the amount should be close to zero and not more than 1 euro.</p>
<p>ok, let's do it now</p>
<p>I want to write a complaint against you</p>
<p>you deceive the players</p>
<p>I did not deceive you, I provided you with all the information. But if you wish, then, of course, you can write a complaint against me.</p>
<p>Well now you will see for yourself your deception</p>
<p>but of course you'll come up with something</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>balance 0 euro</p>
<p>what to do?</p>
<p>I can’t activate my deposit bonus</p>
<p>Let's come up with a reason why the bonus doesn't work?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Alexanders. I really can’t activate the bonus for you due to the decision of the project administration.</p>
<p>ahahahahahaa</p>
<p>deceitful creature</p>
<p>Once again I apologize for the previously incorrectly provided information.</p>
<p>return 86 euros balance</p>
<p>I'll take them out</p>
<p>I told you it would be cheating</p>
<p>they are</p>
<p>it is a fact that you are deceiving the players</p>
<p>You have used these funds, a refund cannot be made.</p>
<p>I did everything as you said, and the fact is that they deceived me</p>
<p>They also forced me to drain my balance</p>
<p>hahaha</p>
<p>top scam</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you, Alexanders.</p>
<p>you have not fulfilled your obligations</p>
<p>what apologies</p>
<p>return the balance if not scammers</p>
<p>VIP-manager Yaroslava 10:31 AM</p>
<p>We cannot return the funds to you since you have already used them by placing bets in the games.</p>
<p>great plan</p>
<p>say that the bonus will be available when the balance is drained</p>
<p>and when a player drains the balance, then say that you can’t do anything</p>
<p>like I said, scammers</p>
