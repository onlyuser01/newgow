<p>The leading casino loyalty and technology solutions provider, Acres Manufacturing Company, continues its US expansion after announcing a new deal. On Monday, the company revealed it joined forces with California's Rolling Hills Casino and Resort located in Corning.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, the resort will become the latest location to introduce the company's leading Cashless Casino technology application which is a part of its Foundation platform. According to Acres, the launch is expected to be completed during the first half of this year.</p>
<p>The company's leading Cashless Casino application stands out as one of the best cashless gaming and loyalty solutions currently on the market. The leading developer explained that the solution works with any table game or slot machine and its deployment is seamless.</p>
<p>Acres explains that to deploy its Cashless Casino technology, partner operators only need to pick a payment processor and a mobile application. "The app becomes the user interface, ensuring that branding is fully compatible with the rest of the operator's player-facing options," explained the leading developer.</p>
<p>Whenever a casino player taps into the application they can start wagering. This is when the payment processor delivers "free flow" access to the player's funds while the customer is using a slot machine, for example. At the same time, Acres' leading solution supports dispute resolution tools as well as audit reports.</p>
<p>In a statement released by the company on January 30, 2023, Noah Acres, said: "We are excited that Rolling Hills Casino has selected Acres' Cashless Casino application to deliver cashless gaming's many benefits to their customers." He explained that the company's platform delivers innovative experiences for the customers while at the same time boosting engagement for the operators.</p>
<p>"We've designed Cashless Casino to be easy and intuitive to roll out which will help the Rolling Hills Casino team to focus on player education and the gaming entertainment experience," added Acres.</p>
<p>He outlined that the deployment of cashless technology that is powered by the company's Foundation platform increases customer engagement and also creates entertaining experiences for visitors. In turn, Acres said, gambling operators see an uptick in both visitation and spending. Finally, he predicted that the Rolling Hills Casino customers will benefit from Acres' leading cashless technology.</p>
<p>Located in Corning, Rolling Hills Casino and Resort is a leading entertainment destination for Northern California. Besides a casino, the resort offers three restaurants and two conference centers. Visitors of the resort can also benefit from The Links at Rolling Hills Golf Course and other entertainment options. Currently, Rolling Hills Casino and Resort supports more than 700 jobs.</p>
