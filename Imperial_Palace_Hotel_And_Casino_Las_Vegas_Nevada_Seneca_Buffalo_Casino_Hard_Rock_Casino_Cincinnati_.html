    <h1>Imperial Palace Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Nevada Seneca Buffalo Casino Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati</h1>

<p>The family of a man who suffered a heart attack while playing blackjack at Wynn Las Vegas and passed away months later is taking the casino to court</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, first reported on by Las Vegas Review-Journal, the alleged victim, David Jagolinzer, a Florida lawyer, was visiting the Wynn Las Vegas while in town for a conference in 2022.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges wrongful dead, describing what it claims to be an inadequate response from the casino’s staff. Jagolinzer was in cardiac arrest on April 6 and collapsed on the table for what the lawsuit says was 15 minutes before the dealer realized there was something wrong.</p>
<p>Delayed Response and Neglect by Staff, Plaintiffs Suggest</p>
<p>The plaintiffs detailed several instances of alleged negligence by the resort’s staff, both in the way they were trained to offer aid and how they treated Jagolinzer who was having a health emergency.</p>
<p>For one, the casino staff tried using a defibrillator on the victim but were not properly trained to do so the court filing says as cited by the media outlet. Another worrying allegation is what the plaintiffs say was the inadequate response – the staff would first check on Jagolinzer’s gaming chips before realizing that the man was suffering from a health emergency.</p>
<p>Jagolinzer passed away on October 18, 2022, at the age of 48. He died from anoxic encephalopathy which was allegedly related to his cardiac arrest suffered in April which had not been properly addressed. The lawsuit says that had Jagolinzer received the necessary medical help in a timely manner, his death would have been voided.</p>
<p>Wynn Las Vegas has denied these allegations as false and confirmed in a statement that it would defend itself in a court of law.</p>
