<p>The next race on the 2023 NASCAR calendar is the Quaker State 400 Presented by Walmart. It’s taking place at Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Georgia, on Sunday, July 9</p>
<p>The 2023 Quaker State 400 odds suggest this is going to be one incredibly exciting race. There isn’t a single driver who’s a standout favorite, but six of them have betting odds in the range of +1000 and +1200. Further, there are another five with odds between +1400 and +1600.</p>
<p>Something similar was the case in the previous edition of the Quaker State 400 race, which was won by Chase Elliott who was priced at +1000 before the race. He’s got the same odds ahead of the 2023 race, making everyone wonder if he’s going to win it again. So, will he? Keep reading our Quaker State 400 preview to see our prediction!</p>

<p>Chase Elliott Loves These Sorts of Races</p>
<p>The 2023 Quaker State 400 is a 1.54-mile 260-lap speedway race with superspeedway rules. Chase Elliott is a driver that excels in these sorts of events. Last season, we saw him triumph at Quaker State 400, as well as the 2022 YellaWood 500 at Talladega Superspeedway, which remains his last win to date.</p>
<p>In the 2023 NASCAR season, he’s without a single win, but that’s understandable as he missed seven races due to an injury and suspension. However, he still has a chance to challenge for the 2023 NASCAR Playoffs. But for that, he needs to do even better than before – Elliott needs to start winning races again.</p>
<p>Other 2023 Quaker State 400 Contenders</p>
<p>Kyle Busch – the winner of the Quaker State 400 in 2008 – has got the same NASCAR odds (+1000) as Elliott. The reason is the same again; this guy too likes these sorts of races. Unlike Elliott, however, Busch is flying high in the Drivers’ Championship standings. He’s currently 5th with three wins in 2023, and two second places.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Martin Truex Jr., the man who’s currently sitting top of the rankings. He did poorly last weekend in Chicago, finishing in 32nd place, which is why he surely wants to do much, much better on July 9.</p>
<p>Another driver who’s determined to up his performance is Ryan Blaney. Even though he’s still relatively high in the standings, he hasn’t finished inside the top 30 in over a month.</p>
<p>2023 Quaker State 400 Prediction</p>
<p>Sunday’s race looks ideal for Chase Elliott to end his winless run. He loves this course, and his recent form suggests that the first triumph in 2023 is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Pick: Chase Elliott to win</p>
