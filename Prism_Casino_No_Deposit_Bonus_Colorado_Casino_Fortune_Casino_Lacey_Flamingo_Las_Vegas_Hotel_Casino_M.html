<p>MansionBet, the sports betting brand of Mansion Group, decided to extend its sponsorship deal with Arena Racing Company (ARC) and Jockey Club Racecourses (JCR) as part of the continued in 2021 support of British racing.</p>
<p>“We are both excited and proud to continue our support of British racing into 2021. Having taken huge steps forward to improve our racing product over the last 12 months, we continue to strive to deliver the best offering to our customers.” David Murphy, Chief Marketing Officer, Mansion</p>
<p>In 2020, MansionBet branding was present across a number of race courses, including the year-end MansionBet Challow Hurdle day which took place at Newbury.</p>
<p>“It’s been terrific to work with the team at MansionBet since 2019 and to watch our partnership along with the brand’s commitment to British Horseracing go from strength to strength.” David Leyden Dunbar, Group Director, Partnerships, ARC</p>
<p>MansionBet extended its financial support after an unprecedented year of sponsorship in which horse races were suspended mid-March, after the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) undertook the measure and shut down race courses until the end of April in response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Having extended the closure period until the end of May, the BHA announced a provisional fixture schedule for June, July and August, allowing race courses to resume operations behind closed doors and in line with health and safety guidelines in June.</p>
<p>“2020 was a challenging year for racecourses across the country and we’re pleased to be able to put our name to over 60 events at 26 different venues in 2021.” David Murphy, Chief Marketing Officer, Mansion</p>
<p>The partnership deal covers over 360 races across 60 fixtures at race courses such as Market Rasen, Doncaster, Huntington, Ffos Las and Newcastle, as well as the Spring Cup at Newbury, granting MansionBet title sponsorship. The sportsbook would also become an Official Betting Partner of Goodwood’s Opening Saturday.</p>
<p>“Our racecourse teams look forward to working with them again in 2021 and delivering a fantastic schedule of racing across many of our courses throughout the year.” David Leyden Dunbar, Group Director, Partnerships, ARC</p>
<p>The sportsbook of Gibraltar-based Mansion Group would continue to be powered by DraftKings, after MansionBet and the Boston-based sports betting and technology provider extended their partnership to let MansionBet utilize DraftKings’ B2B technology. The deal also ensured MansionBet would receive managed services in terms of compliance, payments and anti-fraud protocols.</p>
