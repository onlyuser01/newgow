    <h1>Casino Games Boomtown Casino Biloxi Gratton Casino Mgm Springfield Casino The Lodge Casino Blackhawk</h1>

<p>Greek-headquartered leading gaming solutions supplier and operator Intralot announced Friday its US subsidiary, Intralot, Inc. entered into an agreement with Major League Baseball (MLB) to become an Authorized Gaming Operator of the league. The deal comes just in time for the start of the new regular baseball season.</p>
<p>Access to Official Data, Marks and Logos</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal signed with the MLB, the technology provider that is active in 44 regulated jurisdictions will gain immediate access to official data, marks and logos from the league, to use them into its sports wagering platform.</p>
<p>Intralot expressed its delight at the new deal, outlining it would complement other existing partnerships to bring immediate benefits to lottery customers and their players in terms of both retail and online platforms experience. The gaming solutions provider strongly believes the new MLB season that has just started will be unlike any other so far and is worth the effort to be matched with unique experience betting-wise.</p>
<p>“We are excited to work with MLB to bring our players and MLB fans an enhanced Sports Betting experience. The 2020 season will be one to remember for years to come, and at INTRALOT, Inc, we are ready to bring our players the best Sports Betting platform by incorporating this new and thrilling partnership.” Byron Boothe, CEO, INTRALOT, Inc.</p>
<p>Intralot’s Presence Set to Expand</p>
<p>Intralot has already sports betting operations in Montana, where it powered up the Sports Bet Montana-branded terminals rolled-out to more than 140 locations across the state by the Montana Lottery Commission. The Greek technology provider is also active in the District of Columbia, where the lottery operator invited Intralot to extend its offer to sports betting and run in a centralized manner. Besides operations in the Treasure State and the District of Columbia, Intralot is moving ahead with its planned launch in the coming months in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The US subsidiary of the European technology solutions supplier has been very active recently, entering into several partnership deals in the space of two days. First, Intralot, Inc. extended its current contract with the Vermont Lottery to continue to provide lottery services through its world-renowned LOTOS central system and Photon terminals and Winstations, July 20.</p>
<p>A day later, Intralot announced another strategic partnership deal, this time with the provider of Live Casino solutions Evolution Gaming, to enable Live Casino services across Intralot’s entire global market.</p>
