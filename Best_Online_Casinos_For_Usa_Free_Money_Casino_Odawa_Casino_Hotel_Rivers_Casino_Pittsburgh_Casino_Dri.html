<p>SBC Summit Barcelona was definitely filled with surprises and one of the event’s biggest reveals was the announcement by SB22 about the company’s VR22 solution, billed as the industry’s first Virtual Reality Betting Platform. This new and ambitious project promises to do a lot to help change consumer understanding of what a great sports betting product should be like.</p>
<p>The platform will combine what it describes as 360-degree live game streaming and betting solutions. The platform can be adjusted to host real money gaming as well as free-to-play games based on SB22’s own bespoke technology. And, not least, SB22 has big expectations from its product.</p>
<p>VR22 will empower consumers to get "a seat" in the game and have the ability to interact with the action that is unfolding before them in completely new sensory ways. There has been positive reception of the announcement, with FanDuel VP of Sports Commercial Keith Wall also welcoming the VR solution and saying that it makes it easy for fans to immerse themselves and wager on a game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, VR22 is touted as a straightforward almost self-explanatory solution that will reduce friction and onboard consumers in a quick and intuitive way. This is bound to have huge implications for the product’s long-term prospects. The tool further comes with system-generated personalized promotions, and it also focuses on retaining existing customers. VR22 uses advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence capabilities and is an ambitious leap into the future of the event.</p>
<p>SB22 CTO Marko Savkovic welcomed the opportunity to be introducing this solution and sharing it with a large audience of industry specialists. Speaking at the conference cited by the Associated Press, Savkovic said that the team behind SB22 had a deep understanding of engineering, programming, and the sports betting experience. That is why the company is on a mission to create an immersive experience that is unmatched in its uniqueness and innovativeness.</p>
<p>"With this game-changing experience, fans can interact in ways they never have been able to before. We are excited to help shape the future of the industry at SB22," Savkovic said. SB22 is now on a mission to create what it wants to call the "truly next-gen sports betting platform." Of course, the adoption of VR technology is a huge plus, but it’s not all. There have been plenty of great innovative experiences in the United States.</p>
<p>FuboTV has been able to launch a dedicated streaming experience that it aptly combined with a sportsbook. Meanwhile, social media influencer Jake Paul has created the Betr platform, which focuses on micro-betting transactions.</p>
