<p>Penn Interactive, a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming, became the latest gambling operator to secure market access in Arizona after a multi-year deal with NASCAR.</p>
<p>Boost Fan Experience</p>
<p>The online gaming arm of Penn National acquired market access into Arizona via a deal with NASCAR, which made the Barstool Sportsbook betting brand of the company the exclusive sportsbook of Phoenix Raceway.</p>
<p>“Phoenix Raceway is a state-of-the-art entertainment destination that prides itself on delivering a best-in-class fan experience. Our partnership with Penn National Gaming and Barstool Sportsbook takes this to another level. It will help us continue our mission of redefining the way we engage fans and connect with new audiences.” Julie Giese, President, Phoenix Raceway</p>
<p>The multi-year deal with NASCAR is part of Penn National’s strategy to establish a firm presence as an omnichannel gaming operator with a fully integrated sports media and entertainment partner, and further boost its position to benefit from gaining traction in US sports betting markets.</p>
<p>“Barstool Sportsbook has proven itself to be a market leader in the jurisdictions where it has launched due to a combination of unique offers and a leading mobile experience. This new partnership will allow us to engage a passionate sports fan base in Arizona while having access to a best-in-class sports entertainment facility in Phoenix Raceway.” Jon Kaplowitz, SVP, Penn Interactive</p>
<p>Penn National is already the largest regional casino operator nationwide, boasting 42 properties across 20 states, while its online Barstool Sportsbook brand is live in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois. Penn also operates in the online casino vertical.</p>
<p>“As our first authorized gaming operator, Penn National has been invested in engaging NASCAR fans since we began building our position in the sports betting space. We couldn’t be more excited to provide our partners with access to our passionate fan base in the greater Phoenix market.” Tim Clark, Chief Digital Officer, NASCAR</p>
<p>Named the exclusive sportsbook of Phoenix Raceway, the Barstool Sportsbook will be actively promoting odds from NASCAR events across its casinos and mobile app. The deal will allow the sports betting operator to feature unique promotions for Arizona bettors, while at-track signage and NASCAR’s social and digital platforms will take care of boosting the sportsbook brand’s awareness among sports fans.</p>
<p>Presence in Professional Car Racing</p>
<p>Penn National and NASCAR joined forces in 2020 when the gaming company became the first authorized gaming operator of the racing series to mark its first deal with a professional sports league. Penn is also the race title sponsor at Kansas Speedway through 2026 after a recently extended deal.</p>
<p>The partnership agreement with NASCAR made Penn Interactive the latest gaming operator to acquire access in the largest state in the West to legalize sports betting, following in the footsteps of Australian sportsbook operator PointsBet which entered into a long-term partnership with Cliff Castle Casino Hotel.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Arizona regulators are still considering how to distribute sports betting licenses among applicants, especially tribal ones as there are 15 tribes operating casinos with only 10 permits for tribes provided.</p>
