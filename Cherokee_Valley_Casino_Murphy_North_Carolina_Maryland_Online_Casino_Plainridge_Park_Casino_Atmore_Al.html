<p>Riches in the Rough Slot Review</p>
<p>If you are looking for a high-performing Genesis Gaming 3×5 slot with 243 ways to win, a free spins feature, and a traditional theme with a nice modern twist to it, try Riches in the Rough. The volatile game features twinkling gems bound to capture the imagination of players with its depiction of the riches while also managing to create the impression of cheapness, which is not very easy to achieve in a slot game. The potentially lucrative features and side games make the gameplay even more interesting.</p>
<p>If you have never tried Riches in the Rough game before, check out our comprehensive slot review and learn all about the theme, design, animation, sounds, gameplay, symbols, payout, and special features in the game.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Set on a Quest for Money</p>
<p>The game encompasses the popular quest for money/riches theme that has been used by many other software providers over the years due to players’ natural appeal to it. From the head start, players will notice the good quality of the graphics and animation that place the game above the average in the industry.</p>
<p>The crew at Gaming Genesis managed to create an original game that is fairly more dynamic compared to other gem-based games part of the genre. The game is overall light-hearted and engaging to play. The brightly colored symbols pop up nicely across the grid, standing out against the dark blue background that represents the mine hosting all the precious gems.</p>
<p>Players need to focus on exploring the mine in search of the red, blue, yellow, and green gems and score big wins.</p>
<p>Riches in the Rough: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols in the game are represented by the standard cards marked from 9 to A. As expected, the high-paying symbols are represented by the different precious stones. Among them, the lowest-paying symbol is the yellow gemstone, followed by the emerald stone. To trigger a win, players must match at least three yellow gems. The rest of the gems will trigger a higher payout when matching at least a pair of symbols. An interesting thing about forming winning combinations in the game is the fact that those symbols that participate in a win will begin to glow, while the other symbols will become grey.</p>
<p>Sapphire symbols can also prove to be extremely lucrative when a minimum of five matching icons are seen landing simultaneously, bringing players 250x the bet line. Coming across five ruby gems at a time will generate a win of 300x the line bet.</p>
<p>The game also features a wild symbol used for generating even more thrilling winning combos and lucrative prizes. The wild symbols are represented by a rock symbol with two pickaxes behind it and the world WILD written on the icon using the gems’ colors. The wilds can be used to replace all symbols on the grid with the exception of the scatter symbols. The latter is represented by a mix of all four of the colored gems and they can pay in all positions. Landing five scatter symbols at a time will bring players a massive payout of 800x the line bet. Landing three scatters anywhere on the reels will trigger a prize consisting of eight up to 20 free spins.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The music is extremely relaxing and it matches the overall aesthetics and action in the game. Since exploring a mine and digging up hidden gems requires a lot of focus and attention to detail, the moderately upbeat soundtrack perfectly fits the action on the grid.</p>
<p>Riches in the Rough Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is daily smooth and easy thanks to the helpful control panel on the screen. Players can easily set their bets starting at 0.25 and going up to 50. The game also offers 243 different ways to win and it is partially designed via the HTML5 platform, turning it into a slot compatible with most mobile devices, smartphones included.</p>
<p>All wins pay in any position front left to right, starting with the leftmost reel. The highest win will be paid for each symbol. At the same time, the highest combination of wins will be paid for each symbol on each of the reels on the grid. More information on the gameplay and paytable is found by clicking or tapping the question mark at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Riches in the Rough: Game Features</p>
<p>Players looking to get filthy rich at the end of a spinning session can bag some mouth-watering prizes with the help of the Free Spins feature. The feature is engaged when a minimum of three symbols with the label Bonus labeled are seen landing on the reels. This will activate eight free spins bonus rounds. Provided four or five scatters are seen popping up during the feature, players are rewarded with 15 to 20 bonus games. This feature is also available for reactivation, which means that players who come across two, three, four, or five scatter symbols at the same time during the bonus round will scoop up another five, eight, 15, or 20 bonus games.</p>
<p>Seeing the wilds landing on the reels after the free spins feature has been triggered will bring players either an x2 or an x3 multiplier. Even more, the same multipliers can and will multiply each other. In other words, this means that players who simultaneously get a pair of x3 multipliers will boost their profit nine times. Ultimately, this will result in an excellent 27x balance boost.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With pleasant graphics, cool animations, and overall nice aesthetics, a relaxing soundtrack suitable for keeping players’ hearts racing while digging for the precious gems, and an excellent free spins bonus feature, Riches in the Rough by Genesis Gaming offers plenty of things to a variety of players.
