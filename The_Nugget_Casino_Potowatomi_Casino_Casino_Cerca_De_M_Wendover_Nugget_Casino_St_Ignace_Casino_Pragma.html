<p>Pragmatic Play continues to expand in Canada, the United States and North America in general. The supplier of popular iGaming titles such as The Dog House, Chilli Heat and Wolf Gold has signed a new partnership focusing on the market in Ontario, Canada. The latest partnership has been set up with NorthStar Gaming, which holds a license to operate in the province.</p>
<p>More Award-Winning Slots Coming to NorthStar Bets</p>
<p>Moving forward, NorthStar Gaming will now be able to power the NorthStar Bets brand with a number of Pragmatic Play games which have been an important boost to the portfolios of numerous brands across the region. Among the games that are being added are Sugar Rush, Big Bass Splash, Gates of Olympus, and more.</p>
<p>NorthStar Bets is a brand that is specifically built and tailored for the needs of players in Ontario, and it offers a unique experience to local players. The addition of more top-range titles by Pragmatic Play will give a significant boost to the local market. Pragmatic Play has already established a number of partnerships with prominent companies over the past months, including with 500 Casino, Fortuna Entertainment Group, bet365 and other worthwhile operators and brands.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play CCO Irina Cornides said that the company was delighted to deploy its award-winning slots with NorthStar Bets. She continued:</p>
<p>The NorthStar team has a strong vision of what they can achieve in the growing Canadian market, and we’re excited to deliver our content within the immersive NorthStar Bets online casino for slots fans to enjoy. Pragmatic Play CCO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>NorthStar Gaming CEO Michael Moskowitz, who is also a founding partner at the company, added that Pragmatic Play has a distinguishable portfolio that will factor in the success of the NorthStar Bets brand in Ontario. “We’re excited to provide our players with an immersive and content-driven gaming experience that also features some of the most popular slots,” Moskowitz concluded. Pragmatic Play has just signed a partnership with Casinò Lugano in Switzerland and launched with the land-based operator’s online casino brand, Swiss4Win.</p>
