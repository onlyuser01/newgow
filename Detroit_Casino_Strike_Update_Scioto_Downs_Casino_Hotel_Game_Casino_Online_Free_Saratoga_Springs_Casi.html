    <h1>Detroit Casino Strike Update Scioto Downs Casino Hotel Game Casino Online Free Saratoga Springs Casi</h1>

<p>A person from Graham, North Carolina has hit a $266,982 lottery jackpot. Ralph Mayton Jr, who works as a mechanic, won both the $66,982 jackpot and the $200,000 progressive jackpot. After taxes, the man was left with $190,230 to bring back home.</p>
<p>The man had bought a $20 100X The Cash ticket for last Sunday’s drawing not expecting to win the jackpot, much less the extra $200,000.</p>
<p>The jackpot isn’t the only thing Mayton is bringing back home, however, as he will also return with a single lucky penny he picked on the street while going to the BP on East Harden Street. According to the man, the penny he put in his pocket, brought him luck and helped him win the prize.</p>
<p>In an interview, he said that he now definitely believes that a face-up penny on the ground does bring luck. He admitted that he still has the penny in his pocket and doesn’t intend to part ways with it.</p>
<p>Mayton also revealed that his mother didn’t believe him when he told her that he had won the jackpot. She is sure to believe him when he books them a trip to Hawaii, though, the man said.</p>

For reference, the winning numbers were 16, 33, 35, 39 and 44 with XTRA 02.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Lottery’s executive director, James Carey, congratulated the lucky player on their win and wished them all the best. In the meantime, the lottery is already looking forward to awarding another jackpot prize, Carey added.</p>
<p>Jersey Cash is a game that provides many opportunities to win big, considering that draws are held each day.</p>
