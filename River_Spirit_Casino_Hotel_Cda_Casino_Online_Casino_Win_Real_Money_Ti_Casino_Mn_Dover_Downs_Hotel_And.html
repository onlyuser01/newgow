    <h1>River Spirit Casino Hotel Cda Casino Online Casino Win Real Money Ti Casino Mn Dover Downs Hotel And</h1>

<p>Dear James,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the bonus T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"The maximum withdrawal for any of our free sign up bonuses is €/£/AU$/CAD$/$50 (R500). After the cash out has been requested/completed, your Real Money balance will be reduced to zero. Bonus rollover must be completed before withdrawing any amount. The free no-deposit sign up bonuses have to be completed within 1 week of registration. The casino reserves the right to finish the promotion after this period and remove any winnings thereof."</p>
<p>"While a free no-deposit welcome sign up bonus or the daily 5 free spins promotion is active the maximum bet (per spin, hand, card, etc) is $5 (£5 - €5 or R50). Betting above this limit will void the bonus and any winnings thereof. Winnings originating from a free welcome bonus are also tied to this max bet limit."</p>
<p>I am sorry, but the vast majority of No Deposit bonuses have a maximum cashout limit, and there is nothing we can do about it. Casinos are free to design their bonuses as they wish and we cannot punish them for limiting winnings accumulated by playing with them.</p>
<p>Moreover, our position regarding maximum allowed bet rules is closely explained in Fair Gambling Codex. The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you have been accused mistakenly, feel free to forward me your game history together with a link to the specific bonus that you redeemed and played. My email address is kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
<p>If there is any relevant communication between you and the casino, please send it as well.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
