    <h1>Caesars Palace Hotel Casino Prairie Winds Casino Hotel Downs Casino Red Rock Casino Vegas Atlantis C</h1>

<p>Starting July 1, the global affiliate intelligence platform Deep Competitive Intelligence (DeepCI) for iGaming affiliate programs has joined EveryMatrix, the group that delivers software, content, services, and solutions for Tier 1 and brand-new iGaming operators.</p>
<p>The DeepCI team that was originally brought together by Lewis Civin and Riaan de Jager three years ago will be immediately integrated into EveryMatrix’s current operations.</p>
<p>As a result, the latter will benefit from a series of unique performance tracking tools that will help it make faster and better-optimized decisions for higher revenue.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix, “Very Pleased” to Welcome DeepCI to the Team</p>
<p>At the moment, DeepCI is using its state-of-the-art proprietary technology to monitor tens of thousands of affiliate sites. Its services are offered to some of the most popular gaming and sports betting games in the industry, including Betsson, Betway, bet365, and 888.com.</p>
<p>The new partnership will now also see DeepCI’s “must-have” tools work their magic on EveryMatrix and its over 200 worldwide customers. The tools work by locating all gaming brands on all the pages of the assessed websites.</p>
<p>In turn, this helps determine the level of exposure received by the brands as well as their efficiency on each website, page, and market they operate in. As a result, operators are given palpable recommendations that will help them keep better track of their own performance as well as that of their competitors.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s chief executive officer, Ebbe Groes, believes the new deal will attract similarly remarkable commercial success and “significant benefits” to their customers.</p>
<p>Groes also spoke about the powerful synergies with ProductMatrix, their affiliate management product that has recorded similar rates of success. In May, EveryMatrix reached the €4 billion monthly turnover mark with CasinoEngine.</p>
<p>The company that offers a highly modular, compliant, and scalable platform that helps deliver “outstanding player experiences in regulated markets” has been a long-time admirer of DeepCI’s work. Using the voice of CEO Groes, the group expressed their pleasure to welcome them to the family.</p>
<p>DeepCI Looking to “Further Accelerate” Its Development</p>
<p>At the same time, DeepCI’s chief executive officer and co-founder, Lewis Civin, spoke about the thrill of creating and constantly improving their products that have had a positive daily impact on global gaming brands ever since their launch.</p>
<p>Civin revealed that they were working on “an exciting roadmap of complementary tools” that are meant to generate even more value for their customers, especially now thanks to the quick integration into the fast-growing EveryMatrix group.</p>
<p>The CEO also expressed their hope to witness faster development of “innovative and disruptive tools” with the help of the rich knowledge, impressive expertise, and advanced EveryMatrix technologies that are expected to bring mutual benefits to both parties.</p>
<p>In June, EveryMatrix announced inking a partnership with ELA Games and securing an international Business-to-Business license from the Isle of Man.</p>
