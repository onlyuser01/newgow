<p>It has recently been confirmed that the Poker Sports League (PSL), the premier poker competition in India will be kicking off its third season in November 2019. Once it launches, the third season of the poker league will run up to March 2020. This time, the league will feature a guaranteed prize pool of a whopping INR 4 crores. As if that is not enough, the PSL founder Amit Burman has also vouched to invest an additional $2 million that will scale up the high-profile event even further.</p>
<p>The Poker Sports League is the country’s very first poker league and it has grown immensely since it started way back in 2016. This year’s event is a culmination of all the hard work that they have been putting into the league and therefore there is a whole lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>Registration and Qualifiers</p>
<p>The third season of the Poker Sports League comes just 16 months after its second season went down at the Deltin Royale Casino in Goa. Interested players can now register for the upcoming season of the event – the registration window opened on October 1 and will remain open until January 5.</p>
<p>Registrations aside, Adda52 is set to begin offering online qualifiers for the league next month. Entering any of these online qualifiers will be absolutely free and they will be available until January 2020. In addition to the physical qualifiers, players will also have the opportunity to participate in a number of physical qualifiers for the Main Event. These will take place in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Bangalore.</p>

<p>Unified Platform for Amateurs and Pros</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement of the Poker Sports League’s third season, Amit Burman pointed out that the event has built a great reputation for itself all over the world. It is also doing a great job at promoting poker as a game of skill in India which is known for being unfriendly to gambling businesses. This is especially because of the fact that it offers a unified gaming platform where both pros and amateurs can enjoy the beauty of skill-based poker games. Anyone who is of the right gambling age will be able to showcase their skills during the league.</p>
<p>Responsible gaming is also a major theme of this year’s event. The league will be introducing a first-of-its-kind coaching system that will guide the players to ensure they play responsibly. That said, this time they will not only be bringing a bigger and better platform for poker players but also a much safer and inclusive one.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of the Poker Sports League is its unique team-based – the participants compete in Online Auditions or Qualifiers after which the successful ones are drafted into teams. It is these teams that compete against each other for the ultimate prize at the Finale. What makes being a part of these teams so appealing is the inclusivity, that is, the teams bring together both amateur and professional poker players letting them work together and learn from each other.</p>
