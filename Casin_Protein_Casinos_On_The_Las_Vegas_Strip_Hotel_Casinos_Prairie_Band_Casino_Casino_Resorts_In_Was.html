<p>The new partnership designates Betfred as the sponsor of The Oaks and The Derby at Epsom Downs for the next three years</p>
<p>Jockey Club Racecourses (JCR), one of the divisions of the Jockey Club, which is the UK’s largest commercial horse racing organization owning 15 of the country’s famous racecourses, confirmed a new sponsorship agreement for The Derby at Epsom, as well as The Oaks. Announced Tuesday, the new deal sees the largest independent bookmaker in the UK, Betfred, become the new sponsor of The Oaks and The Derby at Epsom Downs.</p>
<p>The new sponsorship agreement comes after JCR and its previous sponsor, Cazoo, ended their collaboration. The website that offers used cars announced late last summer that it has decided to end its partnership with JCR. This came after the duo collaborated for only two years. Now, the vacant sponsorship spot was filled in by Betfred, which is a highly popular and trusted brand in the country.</p>
<p>JCR and Betfred inked a three-year sponsorship deal for The Oaks and The Derby at Epsom. Additionally, the leading sports betting operator also agreed to sponsor two more races within the two days of The Derby meeting which is scheduled to take place between June 2 and June 3, 2023.</p>
<p>“This is an exceptional deal for British horseracing. “ Amy Starkey, managing director for Jockey Club Racecourses</p>
<p>JCR’s managing director, Amy Starkey, acknowledged that Betfred is a bookmaker with a solid background in horse racing, as well as other sports. Moreover, she explained that she has collaborated with the leading betting company and is aware of how committed it is to horse racing in Britain.</p>
<p>Starkey deemed the new collaboration an exceptional achievement for horseracing. Finally, she said: “This partnership represents a substantial investment in the world’s most famous Flat race and we are very grateful to Betfred for their generous support.”</p>
<p>The new collaboration between Betfred and JCR comes as no surprise, considering the sportsbook’s ties to professional sports in the country. Previously, the operator has signed different sponsorship deals with popular sports leagues which ultimately helped propel their growth.</p>
<p>“I am immensely proud to sponsor The Derby and The Oaks. For me, The Derby remains the greatest Flat race in the world.“ Fred Done, owner of Betfred</p>
<p>Betfred’s owner, Fred Done, explained that the company is incredibly proud to become the sponsor of The Derby and The Oaks. He pointed out that for him, The Derby is the greatest racing event in the world. Finally, Done said that Betfred will be excited to play an important role as the JCR sponsor for the next three years.</p>
