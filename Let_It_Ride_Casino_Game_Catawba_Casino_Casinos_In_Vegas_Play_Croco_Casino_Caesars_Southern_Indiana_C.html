<p>EveryMatrix’s CasinoEngine adds Push Gaming’s portfolio of games to deliver to a global audience and boost Push Gaming’s footprint globally.</p>
<p>CasinoEngine Expands Family of Studios with Push Gaming</p>
<p>Push Gaming has another great deal to report on after the company struck a partnership with CasinoEngine, EveryMatrix’s iGaming integration platform, to consolidate its global presence and reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, EveryMatrix will gain access to well-received Push Gaming titles, including Mystery Museum and Wheel of Wonders. The deal will extend to cover future releases and existing products in the developer’s portfolio.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix feels confident that Push’s products are designed to cater to domestic and global audiences. The studio has already won accolades and praise from fans across Europe, with CasinoEngine allowing Push Gaming to expand globally.</p>
<p>Push Gaming Head of Sales Fiona Hickey was pleased with the partnership noting that it was an opportunity for EveryMatrix to gain access to the company’s award-winning products and share them with an extensive fanbase.</p>
<p>Hickey acknowledged that Push Gaming is joining EveryMatrix’s growing family of successful partner brands and that was something everyone at Push was looking forward to. EveryMatrix CasinoEngine COO Amund Stensland spared no words in praising Push Gaming, having this to say:</p>
<p>“Push Gaming is in the vanguard of game development and we welcome their titles to CasinoEngine’s library, the largest in the industry currently giving access to over 11,500 titles.” -EveryMatrix CasinoEngine COO Amund Stensland</p>
<p>Stensland continued by adding that the company is able to offer the best player experience on the market. He noted that CasinoEngine was confident in Push Gaming’s potential to perform well across numerous markets and do so with high degree of success.</p>
<p>Push Gaming and EveryMatrix Both Seek out Partnerships</p>
<p>Push Gaming has spared no effort in trying to establish itself as a dependable and go-to brand. Its efforts have been crowned with a string of successes, featuring ground-breaking contracts with William Hill and GVC.</p>
<p>CasinoEngine already reunites a string of successful studios that have been more than happy to join the swelling ranks of EveryMatrix’s integration platform. Just this year, EveryMatrix negotiated deals with several high-profile companies, including Elbet, Highlight Games, and BetVictor.</p>
<p>In the meantime, EveryMatrix has had a good run outside of CasinoEngine. The platform prepared a launch in New Jersey earlier in November and sought closer ties with FunFair Technologies. Earlier this year, EveryMatrix expanded its development expertise with the addition of Thailand-based developer of web-solutions TOTOIT.</p>
