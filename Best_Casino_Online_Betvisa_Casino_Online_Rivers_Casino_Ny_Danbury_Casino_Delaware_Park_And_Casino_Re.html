    <h1>Best Casino Online Betvisa Casino Online Rivers Casino Ny Danbury Casino Delaware Park And Casino Re</h1>

<p>The premium integrated resort received several nominations in the 2023 Singapore Tourism Awards, ranking first in the Outstanding Employer category</p>
<p>Such recognition highlights the resort’s dedication to fostering a supportive work environment where employees can thrive and contribute to the organization’s success. As the region recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, Resorts World’s continued investments in its talent pool should help it remain relevant in the ever-changing workforce landscape.</p>
<p>The Resort Ranked among the Best in Multiple Categories</p>
<p>Organized by the country’s Tourism Board, The Singapore Tourism Awards distinguishes the leading individuals and organizations with the best practices in the sector. The ceremony presents up to 30 awards in several categories, representing all facets of Singapore’s diverse tourism and hospitality industry. Winning businesses exemplify the country’s drive to remain among the most popular destinations in the region.</p>
<p>Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) ranked among the top four in Outstanding Achievement in Sustainability and Outstanding Event Venue Experience. The luxury integrated resort also won the Outstanding Employer distinction, owing to its continued commitment to the well-being of its employees. These achievements place Resorts World among the leading venues in the country and an example for the wider industry.</p>
<p>The prestigious award directly results from RWS’ ongoing mission to upskill and re-skill its employees, preparing for Singapore’s ongoing post-pandemic recovery and rebounding tourism sector. In 2022, RWS employees undertook approximately 300,000 hours of training, working closely with industry partners to offer workers valuable job-redesign initiatives and career conversion programs.</p>
<p>Employee Education Is Vital to Continued Success</p>
<p>Resorts World Sentosa’s employee-centric approach should pay significant future dividends, ensuring the resort’s workforce can remain in touch with the latest industry developments like data analytics and robotic process automation. RWS Chief People Officer Lee Shi Ruh expressed confidence that the resort would continue to excel, ready to face the expected influx of new tourists.</p>
<p>This award is a mark of recognition for our strategic approach towards inspiring and nurturing our team members as we chart the path towards our next growth phase. Lee Shi Ruh, RWS Chief People Officer</p>
<p>The venue’s employee-centric programs are part of a broader effort to cement its position as one of Singapore’s leading integrated resorts. In 2022, RWS announced it would invest $298 million in updating a portion of its attractions and revamping three existing hotels. A recent partnership with LIV Golf Singapore promises to bolster the resort’s appeal, attracting more diverse customers.</p>
<p>Overall, Resorts World Sentosa’s recognition by the Singapore Tourism Board marks it as one of the primary drivers behind the sector’s recovery. Its forward-looking mindset, dedication to offering a world-leading experience, and commitment to employee welfare should help the venue maintain its position as a premier destination in Singapore’s hospitality landscape.</p>
