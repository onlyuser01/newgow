<p>The provider of managed hosting, cloud, connectivity and security solutions in North America, Continent 8 Technologies, expanded further its US presence by introducing the first iGaming community Public Cloud offering in Ohio</p>
<p>The announcement about the latest achievement came Thursday and sees the company become the first provider of iGaming Public Cloud offering. This marks a major step for Continent 8, considering the strong potential of the regulated online and mobile sports betting market in Ohio.</p>
<p>In fact, media reports confirmed that over the New Year’s weekend, there were 11.3 million transactions recorded in the state, a testament to the potential of the market, considering that legal mobile wagering launched on January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Continent 8 explained that its solution is suitable for all operators that currently hold a license from the Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC), the gambling regulator in the state. The aforementioned solution allows the operator to deliver all types of online gambling services in the state.</p>
<p>“The iGaming Public Cloud offers a scalable and resilient infrastructure platform that allows customers to host virtual servers, compute, containers, storage and network edge services,“ explains a statement released by Continent 8 Technologies</p>
<p>The Solution Brings Unique Leverage for Partner Operators</p>
<p>Justin Cosnett, Continent 8 Technologies’ chief product officer, explained that the launch of the iGaming Public Cloud solution further expands the company’s offering in Ohio. At the same time, he said that the solution delivers a unique advantage for the company’s customers that benefit from fast market entry. Finally, Cosnett said: “We understand the power of the first-mover, pay-as-you-grow advantage in such highly competitive states and markets, and strive to offer this to our customers.”</p>
<p>“We are proud to be the first service provider to offer an iGaming Public Cloud solution in the state of Ohio.“ David Brace, innovation director at Continent 8 Technologies</p>
<p>David Brace, Continent 8 Technologies’ innovation director, added that the company is delighted to become the first provider to launch a comprehensive iGaming Public Cloud solution in Ohio. According to him, the new solution delivers unique advantages for operators that want to tap into the regulated market in the state.</p>
<p>Moreover, Brace said that the solution helps operators that have already teamed up with Continent 8 in other states and want to expand their presence. In conclusion, he said: “The flexibility and scalability of the iGaming Cloud provides a range of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery options for those already live in the state and looking to protect their platforms.”</p>
