    <h1>Spotlight 29 Casino Casino Hotel Near Me Cafe Casino Bonus Codes Twin River Casino Rhode Island Movi</h1>

<p>Twain Sport will now use Sportradar’s Universal Fraud Detection System or UFDS and leverage the solution to detect fraud and instances of manipulation for its hybrid sports tournaments. Twain Sport is a new live sport vertical launched by BetGames and Hybrid Sports earlier in August.</p>
<p>Ensuring the Integrity of Twain Sport Tournaments</p>
<p>As a result, Twain Sport will offer partners improved fraud detection capabilities, which the company argues are unmatched now that Sportradar’s product is available. UFDS has already been deployed successfully with a number of top-tier leagues and sports bodies, including the NHL, UEFA, and the NBA, producing the desired and expected results.</p>
<p>UFDS is one of the most trusted and safest solutions for the sports betting markets as it uses advanced algorithms and maintains a hefty database of odds and an unmatched ability to detect match manipulation.</p>
<p>UFDS uses an advanced system to track odds that allow it to compare markets and see if any aberrations occur. This is done in real-time adding to the capabilities and capacity of the system which is deemed as one of the safest presently on the market.</p>
<p>The official press release stated that the system was deployed with Twain Sports’ League launch on August 1 for the T-Basket product, with more games to benefit from UFDS along the way. Once again, part of tackling match-fixing is rooted in educating athletes.</p>
<p>Partnership Happy with the Deployment</p>
<p>This is why athlete education is an important part of this partnership which will be added in a bid to raise integrity standards for all parties involved in the Twain Sport contests. BetGames has welcomed the partnership, with CEO Andreas Koeberl adding:</p>
<p>The highest level of integrity has always been the foundation of our new betting offering. We see the integration of Sportradar’s industry-leading FDS into Twain Sport as key layer of integrity on behalf of our operator partners – ensuring we offer the very best live sports product on the market. BetGames CEO Andreas Koeberl</p>
<p>Sportradar Integrity Services managing director Andreas Krannich was similarly excited about the new partnership as well and said that UFDS’ qualities as a fraud-detection and monitoring system were unmatched. By deploying it, Sportradar and Twain Sport can better support the integrity of athletic contests.</p>
<p>Krannich added that nothing escapes UFDS owing to its historical database of matches and experiences putting Sportradar in the unique position of always being on top of any potential match-fixing instance and resolving it promptly. Twain Sport’s offer can only benefit from this.</p>
