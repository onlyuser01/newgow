<p>Bushido Ways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around Japanese warrior traditions.</p>
<p>Set on a battlefield at dawn, this game is full of dramatic imagery and action. Players will meet armoured warriors and a devastatingly beautiful geisha. They’ll lay their skills on the line to win the battle and the war.</p>
<p>This game has a great sense of story and handles its historical theme with a light hand.</p>
<p>Big win in the Bushido Ways slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The epic soundtrack is filled with drumbeats and tension-inducing notes. It brings to mind the climax of a historical war film.</p>
<p>The animation is high quality throughout the game, with the soft-focus battlefield serving as a backdrop. The rising or setting sun is rendered with stunning colours that will immerse players in the scene.</p>
<p>The reels appear to be crafted from wood and contain a range of warrior and weapon symbols. The stunning geisha symbol stands out in warm tones of orange among the cooler colours. It is easy to imagine the characters in a story together and players will have fun joining the drama.</p>
<p>Upon wins, some symbols spark, while others flame. This adds to the feeling that players are on a battlefield and the stakes are dangerously high.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of this game create a consistent narrative and a great atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Bushido Ways is a five reel, four row slot. The number of symbols in each reel varies for each spin.</p>
<p>The gameplay is fast and engaging, keeping pace with its battle theme.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>On reel 3, players may land a 4 row high Wild symbol which will nudge to become fully visible every time it appears. Every nudge of this Wild symbol increases a win multiplier by +1.</p>
<p>xNudge Wild symbol adds a multiplier for each nudge</p>
<p>The game also has single position Wilds which may land on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. These Wilds are sliced on reel 3 to become 2 Wilds in total. They are then sliced into 3 Wilds when they land on reel 4, and into 4 Wilds when they land on reel 5.</p>
<p>Each Wild symbol is sliced into 4 on the rightmost reel</p>
<p>The Oni Transform feature begins when players land Bonus symbols at the same time as Samurai symbols. This transforms them into the best paying symbols present on the reels.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Bonus symbols, they are awarded 8 Shogun free spins. During each of the spins, players are guaranteed at least one Wild to land on reels 2, 3, 4, or 5.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Bonus symbols at the same time as the stacked Wild, they are awarded 8 Geisha free spins. Every nudge of the stacked Wild awards a multiplier to the player.</p>
<p>During the Geisha free spins, the stacked Wild will remain in place for the entire feature. Players will be awarded +1 Geisha free spin for landing additional Bonus symbols. Players are also guaranteed at least one single Wild to land on reels 2, 4, or 5.</p>
