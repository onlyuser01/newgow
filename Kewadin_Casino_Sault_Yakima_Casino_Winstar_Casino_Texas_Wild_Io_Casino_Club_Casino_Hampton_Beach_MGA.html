<p>The MGA said that Rush Gaming could try to appeal this decision as per Article 43 of the Gaming Act</p>
<p>The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) announced that it has decided to suspend the authorization awarded to Rush Gaming. Rush Gaming, holder of MGA License MGA/B2C/701/2019, will thus be unable to provide its products and services in jurisdictions under the authority of the MGA.</p>
<p>The regulator pointed out that the decision is effective as of January 9, 2024. It also confirmed that Rush Gaming will now be unable to carry out any gaming operations. However, the Maltese authority added that the company will still be required to retain and provide access to existing customers.</p>
<p>As per the law, Rush Gaming must provide its registered players with access to their accounts so they can withdraw their funds. In addition, the company must refund all funds owed to the players.</p>
<p>The MGA added that this sanction is being imposed in accordance with reg. 9 (1) (c) of the Maltese regulations. The authority explained that this means that Rush Gaming has failed to comply with “one or more applicable obligations in terms of any regulatory instrument or any other applicable law of Malta.”</p>
<p>Malta’s regulator concluded that Rush Gaming could try to appeal this decision as per Article 43 of the Gaming Act.</p>
<p>The MGA Continues Its Hard Work</p>
<p>The suspension of Rush Gaming’s license comes a week after the MGA renewed its Memorandum of Understanding with the Alderney Gambling Control Commission. Under this agreement, the two authorities will continue working together, reinforcing the partnership between the two licensing territories.</p>
<p>The memorandum once again aligned the MGA and AGCC’s common values, allowing them to bolster their efficiency. The tie-up also aligns with the ongoing efforts to create an international community of regulators that work together to solve the complex issues faced by the modern gambling industry.</p>
<p>A few weeks earlier, the MGA released its Interim Performance Report for the first half of 2023, highlighting many of its achievements during the period. This period saw the MGA conduct 14 compliance audits and 85 desktop reviews, leading to roughly $136,214 in penalties. In addition to that, the regulator teamed up with the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit to conduct 11 compliance examinations, leading to a further $656,366 in penalties.</p>
<p>The MGA continued to watch over the market, help players in need and conducted 40 gambling compliance checks. The regulator was pleased with the outlook, which it defined as positive in spite of the challenges faced by the sector.</p>
