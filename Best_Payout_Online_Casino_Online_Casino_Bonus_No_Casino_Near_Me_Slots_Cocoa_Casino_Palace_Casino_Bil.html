    <h1>Best Payout Online Casino Online Casino Bonus No Casino Near Me Slots Cocoa Casino Palace Casino Bil</h1>

<p>Good day Frumzi,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for replying to me here. It is a pleasure to hear from you.</p>
<p>With regards to the withdrawal, I look forward to your correspondence on how to best proceed. I have been waiting a while now.</p>
<p>Now in relation to the missing deposits I have some concerns. I have just logged into my account hoping that maybe you had added the missing $40 AUD to my balance but instead I find that my Balance History appears to have been wiped clean. My search returned no results:</p>
<p>This is very odd. Why do you suppose this is? All history is missing including my game history. Luckily for me I took a screenshot of the two failed transactions in question on 16/1/2024:</p>
<p>As you will see they show as failed and no money being added to my account. I have already sent to your Live Chat the screenshot below which is from my online Internet Banking that corresponds to the missing transactions (highlighted in blue):</p>
<p>Please be aware (as I hope you already are as I emailed your support team and also mention in this forum post) that I disputed these two transactions with my bank under the term of not being provided with the goods or service. I just checked now and they have not been reversed yet. My bank did not guarantee that they could get the funds back. I am still missing this $40.26 AUD (for some reason that is what Mikado Card - one of you payment processors - took ($20.13) for both deposits that failed of $20.00 each).</p>
<p>The only other thing I could of gotten but annoyingly did not was the Failure ID for both transactions on the Mikado Card website when the transactions did fail. Contacting them myself seems incredibly difficult, looking at their website only has a get in touch option and I did try that and I received an email rejected response. Would it help if I called my bank and asked for the exact time of these transactions and see if they match up with the failed transaction from my screenshot? I have also contemplated making an account on Mikadocard.com so I can talk to their Live Chat but I do have my reservations that this will yield any result. Would you like me to try?</p>
<p>Please look further into this as I believe you will find that I am still owed this money either via refund (possibly from my bank) or to be deposited into my players account (then I will cancel the dispute with my bank).</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and time. Please do not hesitant to ask for anything further you may need from me.</p>
<p>I eagerly await your reply.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Anthony King</p>
