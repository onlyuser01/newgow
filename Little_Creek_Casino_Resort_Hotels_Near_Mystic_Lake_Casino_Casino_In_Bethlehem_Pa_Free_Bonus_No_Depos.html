<p>Wild Yield review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Wild Yield is themed around a wholesome farm.</p>
<p>Players find themselves out in a field of fresh produce with a sleepy scarecrow for company. As the clouds drift through the sky, players will need to harvest as many fruits and vegetables as they can.</p>
<p>Players who enjoy farming and fruit machine themes may also appreciate Wild Yield.</p>
<p>Epic win in the Free Spins feature</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animation of Wild Yield has a cartoon aesthetic with plenty of bright, cheerful hues. The reels are made from rustic sticks tied together with rope, accented with some flowering vines. In the background, players will see rolling green hills and a windmill turning slowly in the breeze.</p>
<p>Among the symbols players will find colorful letters, along with a range of personified veggies. From earnest tomatoes to smug pumpkins to nervous lettuce, each little veggie is a unique character.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, a lanky scarecrow alternates sleep and waking. With his tattered straw hat and baggy overalls, he looks as if he has had a long day at his post out in the field.</p>
<p>The drawl of a country melody reinforces Wild Yield’s farming theme. Meanwhile, gentle bird calls and rooster crows help to create an outdoorsy atmosphere.</p>
<p>Weather symbols transform regular symbols into Wilds</p>
