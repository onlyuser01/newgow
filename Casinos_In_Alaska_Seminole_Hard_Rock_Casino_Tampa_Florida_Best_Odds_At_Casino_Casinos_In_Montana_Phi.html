    <h1>Casinos In Alaska Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Florida Best Odds At Casino Casinos In Montana Phi</h1>

<p>I got an email where they told me they have a reason to suspect that I have broken their terms of service.</p>
<p>I asked what have I broken and I haven't gotten any answer.</p>
<p>I have followed the bonus terms and checked what is the maximum allowed bet and which games are not allowed with bonus money.</p>
<p>They gave a lot of very good bonuses and it seems like they are not happy that I managed to win money with those.</p>
<p>Now their position is that they can just take all of my deposited money, as well as winnings from bonuses. All of my accounts are closed and I can't even try to withdraw my money out.</p>
<p>In the email they wrote that they are taking all of my winnings and bonus money, but they are trying to take all the money in my accounts in reality.</p>
<p>They did this on 8 different sites that are all run by BPGroup.</p>
<p>"Hey,</p>
<p>As I am sure you are aware, under our terms and conditions we have the right to review account transaction information and if we suspect that a player has engaged in illegal gaming, we have the right to close and freeze the account and confiscate bonuses and winnings obtained as a result of illegal/violating gaming.</p>
<p>Following your recent withdrawal requests, we have reviewed your information and have reasonable grounds to suspect that you have used our services in bad faith and in violation of our terms and conditions.</p>
<p>In accordance with terms 17 and 20, we have decided to close your gaming account and any other accounts you have with us, and we will confiscate any winnings remaining on your account and any bonuses you received in breach of our terms.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Anni"</p>
<p>This is the only email I got and no answer to my question as to how I can get my money back from the site.</p>
