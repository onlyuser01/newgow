    <h1>Hotel Hooters Casino Twin Arrows Navajo Casino Planet Hollywood Casino Restaurants Casino In Bethleh</h1>

<p>I registered on the fresh-bet casino around the 1st of May. I made a deposit by krypto and was making a sport bets without any issue. I'm not sure how much I deposited, but if I had to guess it was around 100-200 eur. After I got to 664 euro, I decided I want to withdraw my funds. I requested a withdrawal on the 17th of May, uploaded all documents that were needed in the verification section and I was waiting for approval. Today morning I noticed that my account is verified, so I was waiting for withdrawal, but after some time I got the email saying that my account is under investigation and it might take up to six months (freshbet2).</p>
<p>The situation is exactly the same as with my other complaint (Rolletto Casino). When I'm trying to log in on freshbet website I get notification that user is blocked (freshbet1). I used my personal information for registration, documents got approved (ID document both sides and bank statement to confirm address), I used my krypto wallet for deposits. I haven't used any forbidden strategies while betting. There is no reason to investigate my account and since this case literally the same with the case on Rolletto Casino, I suspect the both casinos are linked.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask any questions.</p>
