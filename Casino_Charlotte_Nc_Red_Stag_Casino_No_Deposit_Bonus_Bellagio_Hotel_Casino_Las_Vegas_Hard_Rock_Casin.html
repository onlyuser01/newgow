<p>DAZN Bet and Playtech have revealed a new alliance designed to help DAZN Bet expand beyond its core sports betting vertical and introduce more entertainment options still. Among those is the online live casino vertical, which Playtech will now help DAZN bolster significantly through the deployment of best-in-class solutions across multiple categories.</p>
<p>Playtech will roll its portfolio of Casino RNG Games, Table Games, and Live Casino Games with DAZN Bet, giving the innovative news sports betting business a good presence in iGaming as well as sports betting. DAZN has long stood out as a fixture in sports worldwide, but the company is keener to keep on expanding.</p>
<p>The partnership with Playtech allows it to achieve just that. The integration has already been launched in the United Kingdom. The companies will then follow up on it with launches in global markets, and a particular early-day focus on Germany, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunities for the platform, DAZN Bet CEO Mark Kemp welcomed the chance to be teaming up with Playtech and said that the new products were industry-leading solutions that were designed to bolster the DAZN Bet sports betting experience and add more dimensions to it.</p>
<p>The collaboration was welcomed on a similarly high note by Playtech COO Shimon Akad who argued that Playtech was open to striking fresh partnerships with innovative and exciting brands, such as DAZN Bet.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to be working with DAZN Bet, a disruptor on the scene. We look forward to building on this momentum and finding new ways to work together as part of this exciting deal," Shimon explained.</p>
<p>DAZN Bet and Playtech will work hard to ensure that the operator is able to penetrate new markets, grow its local presence in markets where it already operates in and generally brings the best possible experience for its target audiences. DAZN Bet launched in the United Kingdom back in August and has been gathering momentum ever since.</p>
<p>The decision to also branch out to iGaming is not at all surprising as it is a vibrant vertical that the company is looking to expand into.</p>
