    <h1>Sahara Casino Las Vegas Mystic Casino Mn Casinos Arkansas Cortez Casino Betmgm Casino Bonus Code Pok</h1>

<p>Dear David,</p>
<p>First of all, good to hear from you, this is the first message from you towards us, ever. Your claim we have ignored your request is completely false, you have not sent us anything, ever. The email you used is correct, however that is an email from the official license authority and if you took a few minutes to read their site, they clearly say you first need to communicate with the casino on the possible resolution and provide proof, probably why you were ignored by them, that is our best guess.</p>
<p>Just to make this absolutely clear, we have never received a single email from this user, to any of our casino email addresses.</p>
<p>Second false accusation is that you haven't received an explanation, you have received an email from us on 9 Jul 2020, 16:18 GMT, everything is clearly explained there, with exact T&amp;C paragraphs you breached and you have read that email, so you definitely know what happened (screenshots will be sent to casino.guru. as proof).</p>
<p>To finish debunking these false accusations, that same email's last sentence is this one „Your original deposit is returned to your casino account. Feel free to play or withdraw it. We will not be imposing our x2 rollover requirement in case you decide to make a withdrawal."</p>
<p>Your deposit was returned to your account and deposit bonuses disabled, that is because we think you are a bonus abuser and we have allowed you to withdraw or play your deposit, without the original deposit bonus which you abused.</p>
<p>We have sent you a reminder as well, that you still have balance (screenshot will be sent as well) and after some time we removed the balance due to the legal contractual bindings we have in regards to total balance amount and left a note for that to be added to you if you ever show up.</p>
<p>What you did is clear to you. You had a big win on a high volatility slot and you spent hours spinning on a single other slot after that win. This game (Sushi bar) is one of the most used slots by people that do exactly the same thing, you are not 1st or even 2nd so we really do not understand why would you talk about not knowing something when gameplay clearly indicates you went directly to a game which will keep your balance as close as it was when you got into that game. It would have been exactly the same if you went and placed bets on Roulette on both red and black. 0 would land a few times and you’d have about the same % of losses. This is bonus abuse, you are using our 125% to gain extra advantage which is fine, but making risk free bets to wager the bonus rollover requirement is simply not and will never be.</p>
<p>Your original deposit is again in your balance and you are free to play or withdraw it.</p>
<p>This case was closed on July 2020 and we acted upon our T&amp;C at that time, the case will stay closed.</p>
