<p>World Series of Poker to Leave Rio, Moving to Bally’s, Paris Las Vegas in 2022</p>

<p>This is the final year that the World Series of Poker (WSOP) will be held at the Rio All Suites Hotel &amp; Casino. From 2022, the event will move to the Strip, where it will be hosted jointly by Bally’s and Paris Las Vegas, organizers said Tuesday.</p>

<p>WSOP vice president Jack Effel also said the series will be moved back to its regular summer slot, having been delayed until fall this year because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The WSOP is owned by Caesars Entertainment, which sold the off-Strip Rio to New York-based property developer Dreamscape Companies in a deal announced in September 2019. Caesars will continue to operate the property on behalf of the new owner until 2023.</p>
<p>Rumors of a venue change for poker’s biggest event have been swirling for some time, predating the sale of the Rio. The property was not included in a series of upgrades on a Caesars’ property undertaken several years ago. In 2018, it was rumored to be in line for demolition.</p>
<p>WSOP’s Long Journey to the Strip</p>
<p>The WSOP has been held at the Rio since 2005, when it outgrew its previous home, Binion’s Horseshoe, on Fremont St.</p>
<p>Caesars, then known as Harrah’s Entertainment, had acquired the Series a year earlier when it purchased Binion’s Horseshoe from the Binion family.</p>
<p>The family patriarch, Benny Binion, founded the event in 1970. The first WSOP was an invitation-only series of cash games that featured just seven players.</p>
<p>The legendary Johnny Moss became the first world champion after a vote by his peers. Anecdotally, the vote had to be recast after each player initially voted for himself.</p>
<p>The following year, the Binions developed the tournament freezeout poker format, now played globally.</p>
<p>Caesars sold Binion’s Horseshoe soon after the 2005 event but kept the rights to the WSOP brand, which it went on to expand across America and internationally.</p>
<p>Aldemir Leads, Play Resumes Tonight</p>
<p>Tonight, for the last time at the Rio, a new champion will be crowned. With three players left from a field of 6,650, Germany’s Koray Aldemir holds a commanding chip lead, with $264M in chips, or 165 big blinds.</p>
<p>That’s more than a 3:1 lead over British player Jack Oliver, who sits in second with $77M, or 48 big blinds.</p>
<p>The last American standing is amateur player George Holmes, who has only recorded one previous tournament cash. With $57M, or 36 big blinds, he’ll be hoping to catch a few cards.</p>
<p>Each player is guaranteed at least $3M. The eventual winner will take home $8M.</p>
