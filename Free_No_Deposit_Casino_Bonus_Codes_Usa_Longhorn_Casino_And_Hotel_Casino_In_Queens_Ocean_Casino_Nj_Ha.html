<p>After a horrible 2020, casinos in Nevada were able to recover some ground last year. There is still more work to be done before it can claim they’ve made a full recovery, but the state’s casino industry should be pleased with the 2021 results. According to a Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) report, Nevada casinos finished 2021 with $1 billion in in-house wins for a 10th consecutive month. This is a record $13.4 billion in pretax gaming figures for the entire year.</p>
<p>Nevada on the Mend</p>
<p>Although the 2021 total almost doubles Nevada’s disastrous $7.9 billion in gaming revenue for 2020, largely due to travel restrictions and pandemic shutdowns, The Nevada Independent reported that in-house winnings reached $12 billion in 2019. That figure that was previously only twice before, in 2007-2006.</p>
<p>Michael Lawton, a Gaming Control Board analyst, told The Independent that casino revenues began to pick up in the first months of the year after COVID-19-related indoor capacity limitations were eased with the introduction of vaccines.</p>
<p>He said that the demand for gambling in 2021 was driven by “driven by healthy consumer savings as the result of stimulus payments and the sustained rebound of leisure travel.”</p>
<p>Gaming revenues in Clark County, Nevada, where Las Vegas is situated, jumped to above $11 billion in 2021. Downtown Las Vegas saw gaming revenues surpass $842 million for the same year, a new record.</p>
<p>Increase in Inbound Traffic Drives Growth</p>
<p>The growth in travel was evident in 2021. Harry Reid International Airport reported this week that 39.7 million passengers traveled to the airport last year. This is a significant increase over the previous year. However, it is still a decrease of 21% relative to the 50.5 million visitors the airport received in 2019.</p>
<p>According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, more than 32.2 million people visited Las Vegas in 2021. This is nearly 25% less than in 2019, but still higher than the 19 million who visited in 2020.</p>
<p>Gambling activity in the state will slow down this year, but this doesn’t mean it will reach a critical low point. Lawton stated that he believes the revenues recorded over the past 10 months of 2021 will return to the pre-pandemic level of gaming win seen in calendar-year 2019.</p>
<p>Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak added about the report, “I am excited to see the continued economic progress when it comes to gaming revenues. This is a strong measure of our state’s recovery.”</p>
