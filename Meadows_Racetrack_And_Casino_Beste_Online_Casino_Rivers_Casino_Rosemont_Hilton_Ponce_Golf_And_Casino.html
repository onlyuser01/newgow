<p>The executive authority that is busy guaranteeing the protection of Danish gamblers against illegal and unfair forms of gambling first discovered the unnamed gambling operator’s illegal services in 2019.</p>
<p>The Operator Breached the Danish Gambling Monopoly Rules</p>
<p>Supervised by the Danish Ministry of Taxation, Spillemyndigheden found that the respective company was offering illegal games of bingo and banko to its members while lacking the necessary license for these services. According to the Danish regulator’s discoveries, the illegal activities took place on a daily basis for several years.</p>
<p>The country has a monopoly on bingo and banko games. Accordingly, Danske Spil is the sole operator owned by the state that is allowed to provide these services. Found in 1948, Danske Spil is the country’s national lottery that offers instant games, number games, knowledge games and machine-based gambling options.</p>
<p>Danske Spil’s license is issued for one year at a time. According to the terms of the license, the operator has to supply popular and engaging games that comply with the current demand for gaming allowed by the Danish legislation as part of ethical frameworks.</p>
<p>The operator is not allowed to create any new gaming products or promote them to a bigger extent that may go over its obligations. The only exception to the monopoly regulations in the country refers to games that are run by a non-profit lottery that directs its proceedings to charities and good causes.</p>
<p>The Court Determined the Operator Breached Denmark’s Gambling Laws</p>
<p>On February 2, a Danish court determined that the gambling operator in Odense had breached the national gambling laws by offering the bingo and banko games to its registered members for several years. Accordingly, the operator was given a fine of DKK15,000 ($2,153) and it also had to cover the court expenses.</p>
<p>Last December, the regulator that issues gambling licenses, supervises operators and monitors the gambling industry as a whole announced it would improve the Gambling Authority’s Register of Voluntarily Excluded Players. The decision was made as a means of allowing users to simplify their navigation on the website.</p>
<p>During the same month, the authority announced it would release version 1.4 of its policies and guidance on responsible gambling. Among the changes brought to the guidance, the regulator announced the implementation of a series of changes to players’ deposit limits, along with changes brought to bonus amounts.</p>
<p>Last week, Spillemyndigheden reported a 7.9% rise in gambling revenue in 2022 compared to the previous year’s numbers across all sectors.</p>
