<p>PointsBet Canada, a subsidiary of the Australian sportsbook, has struck a new partnership with two national curling teams, name Team Kerri Einarson and Team Kevin Koe. The sportsbook struck a partnership with Curling Canada in October, becoming the Official and Exclusive Sports Betting Partner of the sport.</p>
<p>Canada’s introduction of single-event sports betting enabled the country to tap into the pent-up demand for sports, curling included. PointsBet has been one of the first companies to build up its footprint in the country through a series of executive hires.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new partnership with some of Canada’s premier teams, PointsBet Canada CEO Scott Vanderwel said that the company was happy to continue building upon its existing relationship with curling in the country:</p>
<p>“We are uniquely Canadian and want to support athletes and teams that embody our love for the sport and the maple leaf.”</p>
<p>After establishing a strong footprint in Australia, PointsBet launched operations in the United States in the hopes of bringing its overseas expertise and betting nous to bolster its offer in the now rapidly-growing US gambling market.</p>
<p>PointsBet has been able to deliver a strong platform that has satisfied consumer expectations across the board, from interactive wagering to in-person sportsbooks. Commenting on the partnership, Kerri Einarson said that the team was thrilled to have PointsBet onboard.</p>
<p>New Opportunities for Curling in Canada</p>
<p>Kevin Koe is similarly happy to have PointsBet Canada support the team, she said in a press statement. The sport is evolving, Koe argued, and more fans are keen to interact with curling teams and players in new ways. PointsBet is an opportunity to do just that, Koe argued.</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada continues to strengthen its positions in Canada. The company will sponsor curling and the Curling Canada Season of Champions through 2022/2023 as a token of its commitment to the sport in Canada. All of this comes amid PointsBet strong Q1 2022 financial results.</p>
<p>Vanderwel argued that these tie-ups will allow for meaningful relationships between fans and the sport to be built. Vanderwel has also hailed the partnership as a way to introduce the PointsBet brand to more consumers and fans in Canada, which is a pivotal market for the operator in North America.</p>
