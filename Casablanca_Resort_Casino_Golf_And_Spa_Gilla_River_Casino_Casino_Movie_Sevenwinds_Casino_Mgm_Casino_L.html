<p>The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), Malta’s gambling regulator, introduced major changes to its Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018). The authority will now require its licensees to monitor markers of harm in order to lower harm rates.</p>
<p>Malta’s Regulator Amended Its Player Protection Rules</p>
<p>The MGA noted that establishing a safe gambling ecosystem is a crucial part of having a functional and healthy industry. The regulator will, therefore, use the feedback it received through a recent dedicated consultation process and use it to shape a better future for the industry under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We believe that safe, sustainable, and responsible gaming is of paramount importance to the gaming sector. Following feedback received through the dedicated consultation process, the Authority is hereby publishing these amendments with the aim of strengthening and clarifying the current player protection framework. MGA statement</p>
<p>The new framework introduced by the MGA will support its future initiatives and will make it easier for the regulator to add further improvements. This will also make it easier to eventually publish detailed player protection guidelines for licensees.</p>
<p>The MGA Will Require Companies to Monitor Markers of Harm</p>
<p>The current amendments focus on the requirements the MGA’s licensees are expected to follow. These concern gambling operators’ responsible gaming policies and procedures.</p>
<p>One of the most notable changes is that the authority will now require companies to monitor “markers of harm.” This means that licensees must carefully examine their customers’ activity and identify suspicious behaviors, such as increased deposit frequency, etc. According to the MGA, such markers must be considered by licensed companies when addressing problem gambling.</p>
<p>The amendments to the Player Protection Directive, the MGA said, have also addressed provisions relating to real-money reinforcement and staff training.</p>
<p>The MGA concluded that the amendments are based on its own research, as well as on a review of the Directive carried out by an expert in the field. The changes, the MGA said, came into power on January 12, 2023.</p>
<p>The regulator concluded that it is currently conducting detailed research and seeking expert experience. These will serve as the foundation of its upcoming guidelines.</p>
<p>In other MGA-related news, the regulator continues handing out licenses to various B2B and B2C companies. A week ago, the authority allowed BetConstruct to provide crypto solutions. In 2022, the MGA also licensed BeyondPlay, allowing it to provide locally-licensed operators with its products, including its new jackpot engine. In early December, END 2 END also secured an MGA license, bolstering its footprint in Europe.</p>
