<p>After acquiring Wild Streak Gaming for $30 million last June, Bragg Gaming helped the top-tier company specializing in slot game design for land casinos improve its collaboration with International Game Technology (IGT). Now, IGT and Wild Streak are prepared to strengthen their ties even more. The provider is working on creating four new land-based games for IGT, after the success recorded by slots like Queenie, Wolf Run Gold, Dreamy Genie, and Texas Tea Strike it Rich.</p>
<p>Wild Streak Will Release Greek/Lucky Lightning in Q2 2022</p>
<p>Las Vegas-based Wild Streak will be releasing its next game for IGT in the second quarter of the year. The game will be called Greek/Lucky Lightning and will feature two different variations, depending on the number of credits the player will choose to play on a single spin. The games will reach IGT’s brick-and-mortar slot operations.</p>
<p>Wild Streak’s founder and Bragg Gamin’s managing director of group content Doug Fallon expressed his enthusiasm regarding the latest developments in connection to IGT. He added that Wild Streak is looking forward to taking its partnership with IGT a step further, in the continuation of their already fruitful and lucrative collaboration. The game studio also creates content for a series of important online, land, and social casino operators located in Europe and North America. The studio works with a talented team responsible for creating premier games while running a network spanning all around the planet. Wild Streak is all about creating fresh designs and interesting mechanics, and Replicating Reels, Gold Spins, and Fire &amp; Gold are just a few of their best products.</p>
<p>With a strong focus on ensuring the success of their partners and the enjoyment of players, the company is also busy offering consulting services to clients eager to improve their portfolios.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming and IGT Published Reassuring Q1 Results</p>
<p>The news comes after Bragg Gaming published its financial results for Q1 where it showed a 36% year-on-year increase in revenue mostly brought by the growth of its in-house content. IGT recorded a similar Q1 revenue increase, even though the numbers were smaller, with a 4% increase in revenue to $1.1 billion compared to the previous year. IGT also signed a partnership with the Nustar Resort and Casino in the Philippines that is bound to open in the near future. Wild Streak’s three latest releases together with IGT were featured in the Top 25 Eilers-Fantini New Core Games report. In March, Bragg Gaming received supplier licenses for the Ontario and the Bahamas markets.</p>
