<p>DraftKings has opened the first retail sportsbook in New Hampshire by teaming up with Eureka Casino’s The Brook on the border with Massachusetts.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Launches First Retail Sports Betting Location</p>
<p>DraftKings has become the first official retail sportsbook to launch in New Hampshire at The Brook in Seabrook this Wednesday, August 12. Located next to the border with Massachusetts, the sportsbook is hoping to attract visitors from across the state line.</p>
<p>Seabrook has been chosen both for its strategic location as well for the opportunity to host legal sports betting operations there as residents voted in favor of introducing a retail sportsbook last year.</p>
<p>Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill early in 2019 but it took the state over a year to proceed with the launch of a first venue. The 90,000 square-foot sportsbook already hosts a greyhound racing track and it has been decked out with betting kiosks as well as state-of-the-art video walls to make for an immersive experience for bettors.</p>
<p>A special part of the facility goes by the name of “The Stadium” where sports fans can enjoy premium seating and a theatre-like lounge featuring three cinema-size screens and hundreds of TV all throughout the venue to make sure that you never miss a moment of the sports action.</p>
<p>In light of recent events, Eureka Casino Resorts has made sure that The Brook is compliant with the latest health and safety standards. The venue is decked out with hand-sanitizer stations as well as there are measures in place obliging both members of the staff and patrons to wear masks while the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing.</p>
<p>DraftKings Has a Sizeable Influence on Sports Betting in NH Already</p>
<p>DraftKings is not a random partner to either The Brook or New Hampshire. The sportsbook brand launched a mobile sports betting in the state in December under the aegis of the New Hampshire Lottery, the state’s allocated regulator.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gov. Sununu expressed excitement to see both mainstream sports return and The Brook launch in earnest. Here is what he said:</p>
<p>“With major sports resuming in recent weeks, I am extremely pleased The Brook is opening its new retail sportsbook. This retail sportsbook represents the next evolution for the New Hampshire Lottery and DraftKings, which have already established New Hampshire as the go-to destination for sports betting in the Northeast.”</p>
<p>Gov. Sununu also commended the quality of sports betting product and facilities found at The Brook. In a similarly amicable vein, The Brook chief executive, Andre Carrier, said that the venue was proud to collaborate with both DraftKings and the New Hampshire Lottery.</p>
<p>Carrier said that “The Stadium” had been designed with the sole purpose of being the best place where you can watch sports. Other than being at the game in person, Carrier continued, there was no better place to experience sports other than at The Brook.</p>
<p>DraftKings has been able to secure exclusive sports betting rights in the state in return of 50% of all revenue going back to New Hampshire’s coffers. New Hampshire has seen a rather good signage in terms of active users. Some 42,000 people have registered to bet from their mobile at the New Hampshire Lottery x DraftKings already.</p>
<p>Lawmakers and the operators believe these numbers can be improved upon.</p>
