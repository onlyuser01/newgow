<p>NeoGames subsidiary and a leading dynamic and innovative global company, Pariplay, expanded further the reach of its Fusion platform after announcing a new partnership. The company confirmed Tuesday it inked a new multi-jurisdiction deal with BoyleSports, a leading online betting operator.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, BoyleSports will benefit from products from Pariplay's Fusion platform. Moreover, games from the company's Wizard Games portfolio will also be introduced to customers of the leading operator.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new multi-jurisdiction collaboration, BoyleSports customers in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom will tap into new content. Moreover, according to a statement, the partnership between the duo is expected to "further scale to include more titles from the 14,000 strong aggregation platform, as well as more territories."</p>
<p>Steve Payne, BoyleSports' Gaming Director, shared his excitement saying: "Pariplay's offering consists of some of the premier titles from across the industry, fitting a huge variety of player preferences."</p>
<p>He explained that the company is delighted to deliver popular games to its customers in Ireland and the UK. At the same time, Payne pointed out that the collaboration with Pariplay helps expand the company's offering and boosts its footprint in strategic markets. Finally, he said: "This is an important deal for us as we look to bring great content to diverse audiences, and we're confident it will be a success for all parties involved."</p>
<p>Andrew Maclean, Pariplay's VP of Sales, added that the company is excited to team up with an operator such as BoyleSports that is recognized, trusted and popular within Ireland and the UK. "Taking both proprietary content and third-party games live across multiple jurisdictions highlights the agility and scalability of our Fusion platform, and we are confident it will be a game changer for the BoyleSports casino offering," he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>Only recently, Pariplay expanded further its Fusion platform by adding content from Mancala Gaming, a leading online game provider. Joining the Fusion platform in late January, the provider became the latest company to benefit from expanding the reach of its products to new operators and customers.</p>
<p>More recently, Pariplay completed another important deal. Earlier this month, the company joined forces with Jelly Entertainment. Per the terms of the collaboration, Jelly was added to the company's Ignite iGaming platform, enabling the up-and-coming studio to strengthen its global position by expanding its presence.</p>
<p>Pariplay's leading Fusion platform currently offers content from more than 100 suppliers, delivering an array of over 14,000 games. Besides engaging and popular games, the platform provides player retention and back-office conversion tools that help its partner operators.</p>
