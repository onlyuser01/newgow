    <h1>Casino Deposit Bonus Santa Claran Hotel And Casino Espanola New Mexico Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Re</h1>

<p>Dear Guru,</p>
<p>last Friday I where playing live roulette via Spinia to vip roulette. I play regular and i</p>
<p>also play often the same numbers. In this case number 31 one came .... i had about over â‚¬193 on my account , but the number came and i</p>
<p>had full and a bit on this number , but then the screen was frozen and I ( we never ) got payed out. I contacted the live support and they told me it was a technical thing , meanwhile my account was frozen and on zero balance .... then meanwhile i had screenshot from the other people complaining about not getting payed out. So the roulette lady gave me a ID case number ....she told me Spinia wil get back with it. After numerous emails , screenshots , even a new letter from the table guy yesterday , thru keep telling they are waiting for information ..... I had a similar problem with Betamo ... I won</p>
<p>with this casino and they are very fast with paying out winning normally ... but this feels fishy again .Again I have so many screenshots for prove ...... but keep telling me to wait.... I just want my winnings..... couple of days before I made a mistake with bonus money ... that week i won .. but they sent me a mail with that they made a exception to pay out full... but I should remember not making anymore mistakes. I know that the problem with Betamo took ages for a small amount and keep talking in cirkels.</p>
<p>So who is responsible? The roulette or Spinia ...</p>
<p>please advise ?</p>
<p>kind regards ,</p>
<p>Dave</p>
