<p>Pragmatic Play has inked an agreement with Swiss Casinos, introducing its premium games to players in Switzerland</p>
<p>The leading developer of multi-award-winning games that offers its content to the most successful brands in the industry has chosen the only wholly Swiss-owned casino business in the country to strengthen its presence here.</p>
<p>Over 300 Games Are Now Live with Swiss Casinos</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s impressive portfolio which consists of over 300 premium games is currently live with Swiss Casinos and available to the operator’s players. Among some of the most popular titles in the library, we can mention Gates of Olympus, Sugar Rush, Cowboy Coins, and The Knight Kings.</p>
<p>Swiss Casinos’ director of online casino Patrick Mastai spoke about Pragmatic Play as “one of the most consistent and unique slot providers in the market.”, explaining why they chose to ink the partnership with them.</p>
<p>Mastai also expressed the company’s expectations that the deal with Pragmatic Play would “positively impact” their plans for growth.</p>
<p>At the same time, Pragmatic Play’s chief operations officer Irina Cornides has expressed their thrill about being able to welcome the operator to their “growing operator base after a fast and straightforward integration.”</p>
<p>Cornides added that by including Pragmatic Play’s “premier games” to even more players, they expect to further expand their foothold in the country where Swiss Casinos is a top brand in the iGaming world.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Keeps Building Its Momentum</p>
<p>The COO also expressed their excitement about the new collaboration while continuing to build their momentum in the fully regulated market in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The developer is already present in the country thanks to similar agreements signed with other popular Swiss brands including Pasino.ch (Groupe Partouche) and 7melons (Grand Casino Bern).</p>
<p>The developer’s decisions come to prove its commitment to cementing its role as the number one slot developer and distributor within the country’s borders and outside of Switzerland.</p>
<p>Last month, the developer announced it would launch its content with Track and Races in Venezuela, further extending its presence in the LatAm region with the local operator. In return, the latter would benefit from Pragmatic Play’s slot portfolio and live casino options.</p>
<p>At the end of January, the provider announced it would boost its presence in Brazil by inking a similar deal with Jacare.bet, a popular operator in the country. Around the same time, the provider signed a similar deal with Forbes Casino in the Czech Republic</p>
<p>The agreement signed with Betpoint in Italy was another decision that reaffirmed Pragmatic Play’s position as a leading developer of top-tier content in the online gaming industry.</p>
