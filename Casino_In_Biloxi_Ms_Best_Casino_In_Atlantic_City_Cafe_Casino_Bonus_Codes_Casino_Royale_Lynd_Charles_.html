<p>Former NetEnt executives Andy Whitworth and Rob Fell will step in as a chief commercial officer and chief operating officer at White Hat Gaming respectively.</p>
<p>Former NetEnt Executives Arrive at White Hat Gaming</p>
<p>Leading provider of casino and bingo content White Hat Gaming has appointed former NetEnt executives Andy Whitworth and Rob Fell to strengthen the company’s line of executives, helping the company set off on what is a transformational growth journey.</p>
<p>Whitworth arrives as a chief commercial officer (CCO) whereas Fell will step in as chief operating officer (COO). Both executives have already worked together as part of NetEnt and prior to the buyout by Evolution, which saw them depart the company in December 2020.</p>
<p>It was under their guidance that NetEnt ended up buying Red Tiger, a premier developer of slot gaming products, and a first acquisition outside of its own proprietary technology for the company. The pair has worked together in the past, specifically within Entain known as GVC Holdings back then.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming is hoping that by adding to its c-level executive team it will be able to steer the company on a growth trajectory throughout 2021, repeating some of the successes it achieved in 2020.</p>
<p>The Pair to Decide What Direction White Hat Should Take Next</p>
<p>It will be largely up to Whitworth and Fell to decide what direction White Hat Gaming should take moving forward. Whitworth had this to say about his position within the company and what to expect moving forward:</p>
<p>“We have a clear goal of delivering gaming perfection to our partners and customers, and our goal as always will be the best and biggest disruptor” -White Hat Gaming chief commercial officer (CCO) Andy Whitworth</p>
<p>Part of White Hat Gaming’s ambitions is to continue growing in the United States where it has already debuted its player account management or PAM system with Penn National Gaming’s Barstool.</p>
<p>Fell did add that he’s looking forward to helping the company continue building upon its success and develop new, highly-innovative products that can set it apart from competitors.</p>
