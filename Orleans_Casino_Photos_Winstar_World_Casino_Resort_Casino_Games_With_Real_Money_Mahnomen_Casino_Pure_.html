    <h1>Orleans Casino Photos Winstar World Casino Resort Casino Games With Real Money Mahnomen Casino Pure</h1>

<p>Casino has a fatal back on their backend. Any microgaming slot you may play it gets recognised as Immortal Romance microgaming slot on their backend. Immortal Romance is one of the few restricted microgaming slots on casino bonus wagering.</p>
<p>If you play ANY microgaming slot on this casino with a bonus it will look like on their backend as you where breaching the bonus terms.</p>
<p>They will remove the bonus and all of your winnings after you complete wager and they will claim that you played the forbidden slot immortal romance. After 10 emails I was offering explanation and video evidence about their site bug they replied to me 12 days ago they are looking at my case. After that they do not provide us with any kind of reply to the emails I send every other day to check the process of my case. The bug is still there affecting anyone playing with bonus on the site. I tried yesterday to play a new microgaming slot on the site (with lower minimum bet than immortal romance) and it still gets reflected as immortal romance on their transaction history backend even if it a new microgaming game (released 2 days ago).</p>
<p>I have video evidence I can send you link privately. I'm attaching screenshot of trancation history playing microgaming games with lower bet than immortal romance (minimum bet on immortal romance on slotella.com is 0.30 cents) but still gets reflected as immortal romance on their transaction history.</p>
