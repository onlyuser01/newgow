<p>Manchester City vs Arsenal is the game that could decide the champion of the 2022-23 Premier League. The game is played on Wednesday, April 26, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester</p>
<p>The EPL title race is heating up. The Gunners are sitting in the No. 1 position right now, with 5 points more than the second-placed Cityzens. However, the reigning champions have played two games fewer. What this means is that if Man City beats Arsenal on Wednesday, we could see Pep Guardiola’s boys get to the top of the table by the end of the month – in that case, they’d just need to beat Fulham on April 30.</p>

<p>Manchester City Going for the Treble in 2023</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola’s men have reached the final of the FA Cup, as well as the semifinal of the Champions League. They also have a very good chance to win the Premier League again. So, can they win all three of those?</p>
<p>They will surely try. Their recent form is brilliant, which gives them the confidence they can do the treble this year. It’s not going to be easy, but they do have an excellent roster. Practically all of their key men are fit and ready for the battle, which explains why bookies see them as the favorites in the next game.</p>
<p>Another reason why they’re expected to win on Wednesday is that the game is played on their turf. At Etihad Stadium, the Cityzens are 10-0 in their last ten games in all competitions and are without a single loss since November when they slipped against Brentford.</p>
<p>Alarm Bells Sounding Off in Arsenal’s Locker Room</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, the Gunners had an 11-point lead over the Cityzens. Right now, that number is only 5, and the worst thing is that they’ve already played two games more than Man City. What this practically means is that if they lose on Wednesday, they will probably drop out of the EPL summit.</p>
<p>What needs to worry them ahead of their trip to the North of England is that their recent form is not great. In fact, they played a draw in each of their three league games.</p>
<p>Another worry is that they have some bad experiences from their trips to Manchester. They lost each of the last seven games played at Etihad Stadium. Further, the last time they won at this stadium was in 2015.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Arsenal Prediction</p>
<p>This game seems like a “perfect storm” for Manchester City. Everything seems to be going in the favor of Pep Guardiola’s boys ahead of Wednesday’s game. They’re in great shape, they’ve got plenty of motivation, and they will have their fans to support them from the stands of the Etihad.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
