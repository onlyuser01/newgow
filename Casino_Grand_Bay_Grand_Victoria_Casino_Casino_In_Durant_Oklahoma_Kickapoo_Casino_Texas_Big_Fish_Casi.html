<p>DraftKings, an American daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting company, is preparing for the launch of sports betting in Kansas. The state’s government recently legalized the betting vertical but is yet to launch it officially. The state decided to allow a total of 12 sportsbooks to operate locally and pay a 10% tax.</p>
<p>In the meantime, DraftKings has begun preparing by devising engaging new promotions for when Kansas’ sports betting market goes live.</p>
<p>DraftKings Unveils Welcome Promotions for Early Birds</p>
<p>It is still not certain when exactly DraftKings’ offerings will be available to bettors in the Sunflower State. However, the company is keeping punters at the edge of their seats by teasing a range of promotions it will be provided to new players.</p>
<p>Notably, DraftKings will offer any pre-registering users $100 across four installments of $25 in free bets each. This means that every person who signs ahead of the operator’s launch in the state will get a few free bets without even having to do a deposit. Kansas bettors who don’t want to miss out can download DraftKings’ Sportsbook App now and sign up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one lucky customer will be drawn at random to receive a $100,000 free bet on launch day.</p>
<p>The Operator Continues to Grow</p>
<p>DraftKings is one of the powerhouses of USA sports betting and gambling. The company’s offerings are available in 17 states and reach over a third of the country’s population. Launching in Kansas will further expand the company’s footprint in the US market.</p>
<p>DraftKings didn’t provide an official launch date although industry analysts believe the company will go live by January 1, 2023. Some are even more optimistic about the launch and are sure that it will happen no later than November or December.</p>
<p>Once the operator launches, local punters will receive many betting opportunities. Sports fans will be able to place wagers on sports such as soccer, football, basketball and many others. DraftKings will also provide college sports fans with betting markets.</p>
<p>DraftKings just posted its revenues for the second quarter of the year. The operator’s financial results for the period are 57% higher compared to the same period last year. This shows that DraftKings’ business is recovering quickly. It also cements the company’s place as one of the powerhouses in American sports betting.</p>
<p>It should be noted that DraftKings is not only a leading operator but also one of the most socially-responsible gambling companies around. The Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling recently praised DraftKings, PlaySugarHouse and FanDuel for always playing by the rules and caring for their users.</p>
