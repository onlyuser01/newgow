<p>Flutter is interested in working with startup companies that can make a difference and benefit the gaming sector</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment announced that its Alpha Hub startup partnership program is looking for fresh companies that are able to create innovative safer gambling solutions. The program’s goal is to shape a better future for gaming and society as a whole, in line with the Positive Impact Plan.</p>
<p>Flutter’s Positive Impact Plan utilizes the company’s global presence to achieve important sustainability goals. As a company committed to having a positive impact, Flutter helps communities “Do More.” By the end of 2030, the operator hopes to have improved the lives of no less than 10 million people through sport, play and its colleagues’ skills.</p>
<p>In addition, Flutter seeks to help its customers “Play Well” and is working hard to promote its Play Well safer gambling tools to its players. The company hopes that at least 50% of its players will use these tools by 2026 and 75% by 2030.</p>
<p>Flutter’s Positive Impact Plan is reflected in its Flutter Tech4Good Award and the Flutter &amp; RGC: Play Well Challenge initiatives that are focused on responsible gambling and community support.</p>
<p>The Flutter Tech4Good Award initiative seeks to leverage technology to solve pressing social issues and appeals to startups at any stage from around the world to join the initiative. Flutter wants to collaborate with startups that are meeting the needs of disadvantaged groups and have a clear plan to measure the impact of their solution.</p>
<p>Flutter &amp; RGC: Play Well Challenge is a collaborative effort with the Responsible Gambling Council (RGC) that seeks to solve real-world problems for the industry in partnership with promising startup companies. The challenge is seeking entrepreneurs and startups that want to create a better customer experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Flutter Desires to Make a Change</p>
<p>Conor Lynch, CIO at Flutter, commented on the Flutter Tech4Good Award and Play Well Challenge initiatives, saying that they align with the company’s ambitious targets. He added that the company plans to provide full support to promising startups that can make a change.</p>
<p>As part of this, we want to utilize our global scale and in-house talent to support the innovative startups that are developing technology that enhances consumer protection and drives positive change in the communities in which we operate. Conor Lynch, CIO, Flutter</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shelley White, chief executive officer of the Responsible Gambling Council, said that her team is proud to join Flutter for the Play Well program and work to minimize the negative impact of gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>The Flutter &amp; RGC Play Well Challenge has the ability to drive real change in Responsible Gambling, globally, and ultimately create a safer gambling experience for millions of people. Shelley White, CEO, RGC</p>
