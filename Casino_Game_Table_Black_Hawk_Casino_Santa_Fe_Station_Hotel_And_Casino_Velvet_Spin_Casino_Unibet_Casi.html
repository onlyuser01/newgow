<p>The poker summer in Las Vegas will be busy as Wynn Resorts is hosting the Wynn Millions $10,000 buy-in event, part of its $16 million Signature Series.</p>
<p>Multi-Million Poker Events Back on the Strip</p>
<p>Wynn Millions will feature a $10,000 buy-in event to fill up for the vacuum left by the WSOP Main Event, which has been pushed back to October, along with the entire tournament series for what is arguably the largest live poker event in the United States. Wynn’s event will feature a $10 million guaranteed prize pool.</p>
<p>Wynn Las Vegas executive director of poker operations Ryan Beauregard had this to add on the occasion of announcing the event: “In its inaugural year, we expect the Wynn Millions to attract professional and seasoned amateur players from around the world.”</p>
<p>“We’re hopeful that the super-sized guarantee of $10 million emphasizes our goal of making the Wynn Millions a staple event for years to come, adding to our already world-class tournament schedule,” Beauregard added.</p>
<p>Regardless of the temporary setback, Wynn Millions, a new tournament hosted by the eponymous Wynn Resorts, will now take place between June 25 and July 2 and be a part of the company’s $16 million GTD summer series.</p>
<p>Wynn, though, is not the only casino that will be looking to tap into the pent-up demand for poker action this summer. The Venetian will be hosting the DeepStack Championship Series, which will kick off in May and run all through August with three events bringing sizable prize pots of $2 million and more.</p>
<p>The highlight of the Venetian poker bonanza will culminate with the WPT Venetian, a $5,000 buy-in event that promises $3 million in guaranteed prize money that will kick off on July 2. However, the Venetian’s poker series is expected to be smaller in size, breadth, and ambition than what Wynn Million has to offer.</p>
<p>Wynn Stealing the Poker Thunder in Summer</p>
<p>Wynn is stepping on the gas pedal and looking to introduce live poker back with a bang and make sure that nobody misses the World Series of Poker as it were this summer. However, Wynn will be reliant on player participation, something that should be easy to arrange given the let-up in the pandemic and lifting of restrictions in Las Vegas and Nevada.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Wynn needs at least 1,000 players signing up to make the guarantee and offer something on top. The pull of Wynn Millions will certainly be something that will resonate with players, but Wynn is also banking on another event.</p>
<p>The Wynn Signature Series will be taking place between May 27 and July 12, with a total of 30 poker tournaments and $16 million available in prize money, making it one of the most significant events in the history of the game.</p>
<p>That is a lot of concentrated poker action in the space of fewer than two months, making the event even more interesting. There will be five separate poker events that will feature a $1 million payout each and more.</p>
<p>Wynn is determined to make history by giving the poker world a fantastic way back and certainly putting its name as more than just a blip on the poker radar. For anyone looking to return to live poker gaming this summer, Wynn is just one of the first stops to try!</p>
