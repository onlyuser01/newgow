So far, the company offers its services in 18 states and each of its customers can take advantage of its loyalty rewards program. While offering the best-in-class service, DraftKings is also committed to responsible gambling. The company uses groundbreaking technology, resources and training to protect vulnerable gamblers.</p>

<p>Clark Stewart, CEO of Boot Hill Casino and Resort revealed that the company is pleased to join forces with DraftKings. He acknowledged that the operator is trusted, experienced and undoubtedly a leader within the fast-growing industry. In conclusion, Stewart stressed that DraftKings will bring that experience to Kansas when permitted by law.</p>

<p>Jeremy Elbaum, DraftKings’ senior vice president of business development, acknowledged that the company continues to expand across the US. He added that DraftKings is eager to start working in collaboration with Boot Hill Casino and Resort. In conclusion, Elbaum said that the company is optimistic that lawmakers in Kansas are going to introduce suitable legislation that will bring benefits for the state and its residents.</p>
