<p>Sky Ute Casino Resort Debuts Sports Betting App with USBookmaking</p>
<p>Colorado has welcomed a new mobile betting operator with Sky Ute Casino Resort revealing a new dedicated betting app developed in partnership with USBookmaking. With sports enthusiasts in the Centennial State ready to welcome more sports betting opportunities, Sky Ute’s arrival is both well-timed and catering to popular demand.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Colorado sports bettors will be able to download Sky Ute’s app for both iOS and Android mobile devices provided they are of the legal gambling age, which is 21 in the state. According to Charley Flagg, Sky Ute Casino Resort’s general manager, the company is well-poised to benefit from the return of sports, especially by adding a powerful mobile betting solution.</p>
<p>Colorado’s sports betting market launched in May, with a number of established names in the industry making the move on the state, including DraftKings, FanDuel, Bet365, BetRivers, and others. All sports betting brands have teamed up with popular gambling establishments, to wit Midnight Rose Casino, Triple Crown Casino, Saratoga Casino, Penn National Gaming, Lady Luck Casino, Century Casino, The Lodge Casino, Twin River and more. Some are already planning a restart of operations after an official approval has been granted.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to offer sports fans a convenient online sports betting app to place wagers in Colorado and look forward to unveiling the exciting app features to everyone in Colorado who wishes to bet sports. As a Native American gaming casino, we offer Sky Ute Sportsbook app users the best odds in the state,” Flagg added.</p>
<p>Marking a Success for USBookmaking in Colorado</p>
<p>USBookmaking is the only sportsbook company that is owned by a Native American tribe in the United States, making it a pioneer in the field. With the company now cracking into the online vertical, its reach is only bound to grow. Vic Salerno, president at USBookmaking, commented on the partnership, confirming the company’s satisfaction with the move, arguing that teaming up with Sky Ute Casino Resort has been a pivotal step for the company forward.</p>
<p>Colorado has seen a respectable turnout in terms of sports betting handle, with gross revenue hitting $25.5 million at all participating properties. While the sports betting hiatus lasts, Colorado bettors are biding their time until the day they would be allowed to return to retailers.</p>
<p>Colorado casinos have already been making a push to reopen, asking for approval from authorities, even though they are not aware of what the restarted betting and casino industry would look like. Matt Andrighetti, the general manager at Wildwood Casino in Cripple Creek described the approval for the restart of business “a hot potato.”</p>
<p>The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), however, has shown initiative, giving casinos in Black Hawk and Central City permission to restart operations as early as June 17. Sports is also slowly picking up with the NBA and UFC returning to offer a range of events.</p>
