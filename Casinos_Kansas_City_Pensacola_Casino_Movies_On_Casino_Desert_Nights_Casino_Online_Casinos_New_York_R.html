<p>New York Red Bulls vs. Charlotte is the 2023 Eastern Conference Wild Card game. Red Bull Arena in Harrison is the place where this game will take place on Wednesday, October 25.</p>
<p>Both teams have been playing great lately, each with three wins in the last four MLS rounds. The result is that both the New York Red Bulls and Charlotte were able to book the last two spots in the playoff zone. The two finished the regular season on equal points, but the Red Bulls finished a spot higher than Charlotte thanks to a better score differential.</p>

<p>New York Red Bulls Want to Keep on Playing Great</p>
<p>The NY Red Bulls are on a three-game winning streak, with a win over Nashville in the last round of the regular season. They also defeated the new MLS Supporters’ Shield winners, FC Cincinnati, some three weeks ago, which is another proof of how good these guys have been playing.</p>

<p>They’re in good shape, but they’re going to miss a number of first-team players in Wednesday’s game. Three of their defenders – Andres Reyes, Sean Nealis, and Kyle Duncan – will definitely miss the Eastern Conference Wild Card game as they’re all suspended after accumulating too many yellow cards.</p>
<p>Further, NY Red Bulls might miss a few other players who are struggling with fitness. Among those is another center back Hassan Ndam, meaning that the Red Bulls are left with only a couple of A-team defenders.</p>
<p>Charlotte Looking for the 1st Win at Red Bull Arena</p>
<p>Charlotte won three of its last four MLS games. The one they didn’t win was a draw with Inter Miami in Florida. Lionel Messi’s team, however, already knew it stood no chance of qualifying for the postseason, which is why they didn’t go all-in in that game. After the draw, the two played again, but this time in North Carolina. And this time, Charlotte won.</p>
<p>The other two wins Charlotte recorded this month were against Toronto FC and Chicago Fire, two teams that failed to qualify for the 2023 Playoffs. That said, Charlotte’s recent form isn’t as great as the numbers suggest.</p>
<p>New York Red Bulls vs. Charlotte Prediction</p>
<p>Our NY Red Bulls vs. Charlotte prediction is that the Eastern Conference Wild Card game is going to be an incredibly thrilling affair. The Red Bulls are fantastic in the attack, but their defense is banged up, meaning that Charlotte will stand a good chance to score a goal or two. Still, we do think it’s very unlikely that Charlotte will be able to beat the Red Bulls and qualify for the next phase of the 2023 MLS Playoffs.</p>
<p>Pick: New York Red Bulls to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
