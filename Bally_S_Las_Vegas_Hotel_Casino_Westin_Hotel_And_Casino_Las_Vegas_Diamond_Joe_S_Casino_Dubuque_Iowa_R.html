    <h1>Bally S Las Vegas Hotel Casino Westin Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Diamond Joe S Casino Dubuque Iowa R</h1>

<p>I registered with a casino called CASINOIN a few months ago and have made deposits approximately ten times up until now.</p>
<p>When I recently requested a withdrawal for the first time, I was asked for KYC verification.</p>
<p>Since I have been asked for KYC at other casinos, I submitted my verification as usual.</p>
<p>However, no matter what I submitted, they kept asking for new documents and the verification never seemed to end.</p>
<p>The number of documents required has exceeded ten, including:</p>
<p>・Driver's license</p>
<p>・Selfie with driver's license</p>
<p>・Selfie with driver's license + picture showing live chat</p>
<p>・Certificate of residence</p>
<p>・Selfie with certificate of residence</p>
<p>・Deposit history from JETON to CASINOIN</p>
<p>・Profile section of JETON</p>
<p>・Deposit history from VEGA to CASINOIN</p>
<p>・Profile section of VEGA</p>
<p>・Complete transaction history of VEGA after depositing into CASINOIN in PDF (including all transactions outside of CASINOIN)</p>
<p>I have already submitted these, but KYC verification is still not going through.</p>
<p>Currently, they are also asking for:</p>
<p>・Selfie with identification other than a driver's license</p>
<p>・Complete transaction history of JETON after August (with all transactions opened)</p>
<p>However, I don't have a passport.</p>
<p>I asked the casino what valid identification besides a driver's license and passport would be (since the certificate of residence was not accepted), but they have not provided an answer and are insisting I send selfies with another form of ID.</p>
<p>Additionally, they're asking for the "complete transaction history of JETON since August," but am I really required to include all transactions, even those totally unrelated to CASINOIN?</p>
<p>I am very scared because it seems like there is no intention to withdrawal or get KYC verification, and it seems like they are simply asking for various documents to harvest my personal information.</p>
<p>Though I was dealing with it daily, I grew tired of being asked for more documents each day. I had almost given up, but a friend introduced me to this site and I thought I would make a consultation.</p>
<p>I have never been asked for such a multitude of identification documents at other casinos, and I am now afraid of why I am being asked for so many documents.</p>
<p>Is it normal to be asked for such a vast quantity of documentation in order to finalize an initial withdrawal?</p>
<p>Neither the money I deposited nor the money I happened to win this time is being returned or withdrawn.</p>
<p>Am I left with no choice but to give up on this money?</p>
