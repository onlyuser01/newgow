    <h1>Pokerstars Casino Casino Real Money Casinos Near Phoenix Westgate Las Vegas Resort Casino Warhorse C</h1>

<p>LeoVegas has shared exciting news with the company entering the Netherlands once again and becoming a fully-fledged member of the local gambling market. The company has received a five-year license which will allow it to provide its products and services to local customers in the country.</p>
<p>This new license covers multiple verticals, including sports betting, online casino, and live casino offering. A rollout is imminent with the company planning to launch all of its verticals in the second half of the year and bring an outstanding experience to local players.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Group CEO Gustaf Hagman has welcomed the news to see his company enter one of Europeâ€™s fastest-growing and most important markets.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has been actively tackling its share of the offshore gaming market, with LeoVegas now becoming a member of the fully-regulated operations in the country. Commenting on this success, Hagman said:</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to look to the future and fully focus on resuming our Dutch journey: the Netherlands has great potential and we look forward to it becoming an important market in our global growth journey."</p>
<p>The recent rollout comes in the context of a constantly changing regulatory framework which puts consumers front and center. The Netherlands recently rolled out new restrictions on gambling advertisements designed to protect consumers in the long run.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Group has had a string of successes most recently, with the company really expanding its reach in Europe with new launches, license applications, and extending existing relationships. In May, the Group announced the launch of its expekt brand in Denmark.</p>
<p>The company similarly obtained a license in Sweden in June. At the same time, the company was able to extend its ongoing partnership with Kambi, which provides the group with its advanced sports betting solutions to deliver unmatched consumer experiences.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Group will launch in the Netherlands through the 21 Heads Up Limited following the now-formal go-ahead from the Kansspelautoriteit, the Dutch gaming authority.</p>
