<p>Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman established a new committee that would oversee the gaming regulation in the state. Besides overseeing the gaming, the newly established committee would analyze the impact of the industry in Ohio.</p>
<p>Committee on Gaming Established in Ohio</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman announced the creation of a Senate Select Committee on Gaming in the state. The newly created committee would be overseeing the gaming regulation in the state as well as online gambling, e-bingo machines, and online lotteries. Furthermore, it would analyze what is the impact of the gaming industry on the state.</p>
<p>Senator Kirk Schuring was appointed chair of the new committee, while Senator Nathan Manning was appointed vice-chair. Senator Louis W. Blessing, III, Senator George F. Lang, Senator Cecil Thomas, Senator Hearcel F. Craig, and Senator Niraj Antani were also appointed as members of the new gaming committee.</p>
<p>“The growing gaming industry is something Ohio must be prepared to address.” Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Huffman acknowledged that the gaming industry in Ohio is growing and the state must be prepared to address this. He added that the committee will be responsible for overseeing the activity but also asking “the tough questions“. In conclusion, Mr. Huffman outlined that he is looking forward to the committee’s recommendations. If all goes as planned, the newly established gaming committee is expected to start operating in May.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the new committee would have plenty of work considering the expanding market in the state. Moreover, last week Governor Mike DeWine revealed that sports betting may be legalized this year. Although there were few attempts to legalize the activity in the Buckeye State, so far none of the bills made it forward.</p>
