<p>William Hill is doubling down on its commitment to esports betting with the popular British bookmaker brand signing up a partnership with PandaScore as its new Esports Betting Supplier.</p>
<p>Moving forward, PandaScore will assist with William Hill’s competitive video gaming offer, providing odds for a number of player-favorite titles, such as Dota 2, League of Legends, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</p>
<p>PandaScore will deploy its cutting-edge odds feeds to power William Hill’s sprawling offer in the esports betting space. Once thought as a complementary product to sports, esports competitions today generate significant viewership interest and betting action, prompting prominent bookmakers such as William Hill to sit up and act.</p>
<p>Venturing into the esports betting space, though, has always required a deeper understanding into the sector as conventional trading analysis tends to fail because of the unique nature of esports and how players can outperform others.</p>
<p>William Hill is not just determined to improve on its existing esports product offer, though. The company similarly wishes to expand its offering and scale the available betting markets. PandaScore already supports an entire host of titles for which it provides real-time updates.</p>
<p>Besides the three titles covered under the current deal, the company also runs feeds for Call of Duty, Overwatch, Valorant, King of Glory, StarCraft, Rocket League, and many more. This partnership will enable William Hill to pursue a widely ambitious goal of becoming a one-stop shop for all things esports betting.</p>
<p>William Hill hopes to improve its standing in both the in-play and pre-game esports betting markets, bringing excellent bet builder tools to the fore, and enabling players to bet on player props along with many other solutions. PandaScore senior sales manager Dasha Kirilishina welcomed this opportunity.</p>
<p>Esports on the Cups of Entering Mainstream</p>
<p>Kirilishina said that the company was thrilled to be working with William Hill and land it the know-how and expertise to improve its odds feeds and give it a competitive advantage. She added:</p>
<p>Esports betting is on the cusp of entering the mainstream, allowing operators to engage new audiences and also provide tremendous added value to those already active with their brand. William Hill has recognized the growth opportunity and, via our odds feed, will be able to offer a leading esports betting experience. PandaScore senior sales manager Dasha Kirilishina</p>
<p>PandaScore also stands to benefit from this partnership as it consolidates the company’s position in the sector. William Hill global director of sportsbook Nick Maurice said that the company sees “a massive potential” in the esports vertical that can be realized with help from companies such as PandaScore.</p>
<p>Maurice is confident that PandaScore will help William Hill garner access to cutting-edge solutions that will enable the company to pursue its further expansion in the sector. “We look forward to leveraging its odds feed and unmatched experience to take our esports betting customer experience to the next level,” Maurice concluded.</p>
