    <h1>Casino Poker Bowler Casino Platinum Reels Casino Grand Falls Casino Iowa Online Slot Casinos MGM Res</h1>

<p>Provider of LTE/5G wireless and fiber-neutral host communications infrastructure ExteNet Systems signed a partnership with MGM Resorts International to build and operate advanced in-building signal and connectivity solutions across MGM properties nationwide.</p>
<p>Help Elevate Guest Experience</p>
<p>The groundbreaking partnership between MGM Resorts and ExteNet will see the communications infrastructure solutions supplier bring a new distributed wireless network to 25 properties owned by the hospitality and gaming operator, comprising an aggregate of more than 43,000 guest rooms across 54 million square feet, and impacting the experience of more than 70 million visitors annually.</p>
<p>Jim Kimball, executive director of Enterprise Collaboration at MGM Resorts, focused on the operator’s commitment to “elevating every guest experience” during times when the world is heavily reliant on mobile devices and mobile applications which was the main driver for MGM Resorts to partner with ExteNet.</p>
<p>“They delight in the user experience – so our properties can reliably bring better service and enrichment to our guests,” Kimball concluded.</p>
<p>The partnership that represents the largest in-building cellular enhancement project in the US will allow MGM Resorts to offer its guests unparalleled mobile connectivity powered by next-generation wireless infrastructure to match the quality of their accommodations, entertainment venues, food and dining options, and casinos.</p>
<p>Complement ‘World-Class Offerings’</p>
<p>Excited to “embark on the largest neutral host project in the country,” Rich Coyle, chief executive officer of ExteNet Systems, outlined that the communication infrastructure supplier would be looking to implement an “aggressive deployment schedule for MGM properties,” stressing the benefits greater connectivity would bring to MGM by enhancing its “world-class offerings for guests and support upcoming plans and development with future-ready solutions.”</p>
<p>The expanded 5G service at MGM properties will support connectivity for around 200,000 visitors daily, eliminate dead zones and enhance the productivity of data-heavy apps, maps and other high-tech capabilities to help the business affirm its position as Las Vegas’ premier casino resort operator.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the agreement, Marc Ganzi, chief executive officer of one of ExteNet System’s investors, Digital Bridge, outlined that “working with customers is at the heart” of the business, hailing MGM Resorts as an operator that “delivers such unique and memorable experiences” and confident that the team at ExteNet Systems has “the expertise to deliver value” for its partner and enhance the experience for its guests.</p>
<p>According to ExteNet Systems’ aggressive deployment schedule, properties are projected to be completed between Fall 2022 and Fall 2024 ahead of the Formula 1 World Championship in November 2023 and Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024.</p>
