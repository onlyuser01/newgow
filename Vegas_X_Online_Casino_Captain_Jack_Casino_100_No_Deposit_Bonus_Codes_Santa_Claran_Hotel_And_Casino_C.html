    <h1>Vegas X Online Casino Captain Jack Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Codes Santa Claran Hotel And Casino C</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>With all due respect you appear to believe that this is the first time you have heard that I have a serious gambling addiction. If you read back on the 60 emails sent between October and February from me to you, CEG, UKGC etc you will know it is clear from the very beginning that there was a severe addiction.</p>
<p>As we have been over many times on email - how could you not detect and stop any duplicate accounts? Also, you are aware that a self exclusion was entered into on the initial accounts. Your sign up is incredible....a child could bypass it. Name, Country, Email. That is all that is required to be able to play on your site and deposit because there are NO CHECKS of any kind until, as stipulated multiple times, withdrawals.</p>
<p>If you note on the first account I did win and subsequently excluded the account. However, my addiction again brought me back to the table and you didn't detect any duplicates because I openly copied emails between the excluded account detail and new email address to send to you. I asked CEG to enact exclusion thinking this would prevent me from playing. The real story is that your signup process is very easy to go through and deposit. I deposited on 28 odd accounts with no chance of ever withdrawing funds - that is pathological gambling addiction - and was only stopped after cancelling all my credit cards, blocking my debit card and restricting my Revolut bank account. Mystake did nothing to prevent me from playing. You know that the same names were used. In fact, the exact same Paydo 3rd party email was entered on most of the accounts to accept payment so you would have again been aware that the excluded email address was still being used prominently.</p>
<p>The lack of legitimate response when I copied in CEG Push Gaming and the UKGC tells its own story.</p>
<p>The case is clear - I consistently advised that I had a severe addiction to gambling and pleaded with you to change the signup process or at least ask for verification before deposit...this was completely ignored. Not to mention emails sent to the excluded account offering bonuses multiple times following the exclusion.</p>
<p>This episode has essentially left me in severe debt and as I stated previously, if it cannot be resolved amicably then I 100% will be taking legal action. I have already sourced a Cura√ßao lawyer who confirms the case is strong. It is sad really as this situation could have been sorted out months ago had Mystake listened but you chose to ignore.</p>
