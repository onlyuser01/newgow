    <h1>Sunset Station Hotel And Casino Casino Royale 007 Theme Golden Nugget Lake Tahoe Hotel Casino Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Gabygg,</p>
<p>I was recently in contact with the casino representative outside of the thread and was provided with the supporting evidence.</p>
<p>After gathering and reviewing all the necessary information, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions in several ways - There are reasonable grounds to believe we are talking about multiple accounts used by 1 person or collusion for the purpose of bypassing the casino's restrictions and betting limitations imposed by the casino on the linked casino account that was registered earlier in 2022 and used for abusive play, using the same common patterns to accumulate winnings. In addition, to a considerable extent, the accusations for both accounts relate to sports betting and breaching its rules and restrictions, which is a sphere we do not have enough insight to take on since we deal with complaints about online casinos only. However, we were provided with enough data to say that both accounts were operated by 1 person, so at least one of them was used with someone else's identity and/or funds, which is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>It is necessary to pass the KYC to withdraw anything from a casino account, and all players are obliged to accept the casino's terms and conditions upon registration. These state the players have to use only their own valid personal details, payment methods, as well as the funds used for deposits. Those are industry-standard rules in all online casinos. Based on the data received, showing so many connections between the accounts, it would be likely impossible to prove that the accounts in question were used by 2 different people, or it would be impossible to complete the KYC on the disputed account. The casino acted correctly and in accordance with its terms and conditions, and we accept its decision.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Although only outside of the thread, thank you very much, Betmaster Casino Team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
