    <h1>Casino Mississippi Route 66 Casino Hotel 66 Casino Lucky Block Casino Royalton Punta Cana An Autogra</h1>

<p>They sent me an email yesterday simply saying I opened multiple accounts, but I did not, they refuse to provide any information about the other account. "By the way no other account exist".</p>
<p>my winnings were the result of a $20 deposit. There wasn’t any type of bonuses connected to the deposit.</p>
<p>they had made the decision to refund $20 only.</p>
<p>I had responded to them, I indicated that I would be fine with two resolutions.</p>
<h1>1. They simply pay me the $180 they owe me. I’m totally fine if the decision is made to close my account. However I need to be paid what is still owed to me.</h1>
<h1>2. I have an account at Cafe Casino, as well as slots LV. I understand all three of these casinos are connected.</h1>
<p>ignition had made the decision to simply refund my deposit, I would also be fine if they will agree to refund my deposits from the other casinos as well. I’m guessing it would be well over $1000.</p>
<p>it took nearly a month to get ignition to respond.</p>
<p>There isn’t another account that I have that I’m aware of, if i had another account I would have used it.</p>
<p>there’s no reason why I would make another account, knowing I didn’t receive any type of Bonus. Again, I was NOT given any type of bonus for opening account , nor did I use any type of deposit bonus.</p>
