    <h1>Pendleton Casino Hotel Avi Resort Casino Laughlin Nv Online Casino Ny Red Rock Hotel Casino Rivers C</h1>

<p>I played no deposit free spins at Adrenaline casino under australian dollars and got through the wagering requirements of 40 x. I had email contact, and subsequently live chat contact as only neteller was available on the site for me to withdraw from which was never actually resolved. In the interim, email advised I needed to make a verification deposit to withdraw which I accepted, but upon talking to chat a little later about the neteller issue they said that that had been deemed not necessary anymore but I had to get my account up to $50 before I could withdraw. So I did.</p>
<p>When going back to chat, again about neteller being the only withdrawal option available ($75 minimum withdrawal) chat suddenly apologised and advised I could only withdraw in bitcoin. This site doesn't convert from $ to btc so my $50 is now, strangely wholly unwithdrawable. Upon contacting email support again for options as suggested by chat, they reiterated that bitcoin was my only option, and again said I had to make a verification deposit.</p>
<p>I have no issue with making a verification deposit, but whether I do or not the $50 is unwithdrable because it's not btc.</p>
<p>This condition is not in the bonus terms of course. The bonus terms say $20 min withdrawal, $50 max. Adrenaline just doesn't want to pay and seem to be constructing rules as they go along to avoid having to do so.</p>
