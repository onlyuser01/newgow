    <h1>Bet Us Casino Casablanca Hotel And Casino Best Online Casino New Jersey Hollywood Casino Joliet Il H</h1>

<p>Hello Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>In July 2020 I requested a permanent self-exclusion on Boom Casino and wanted this to be applied on all brands related to this casino too as I wanted to quit gambling back then. I got a confirmation from the casino and it was all confirmed.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got an ad from PlayBoom which was an exact look a like of Boom Casino and is related to the casino Boom Casino. I ended up in a total loss of €1750,- and after realizing what happened I reached out to the casino for my complaint (Note Boom Casino confirmed on the chat that Play Boom is a sister casino from Boom Casino) as I felt duped by them as the protection tool I wanted to use have failed clearly.</p>
<p>In the Live chat of Play Boom I explained the whole situation and that I would like to be refunded as this is a clear failure from the casino. I also informed them about my addiction being triggered and they failed on the protection, they would sort this out and I expected the casino to immediately close my account as they were aware of my problems and situation.</p>
<p>But the opposite was true as I was able to play today again losing a total amount of €1500 which was after my discussion with the casino about the earlier amount of €1750. This does result in a total loss of €3250, which would ve all been avoided if the Permanent Self Exclusion was executed correctly.</p>
<p>And while the owner might be different (as they hold different casino licenses) both websites are identical and Boom Casino did confirm that it is their sister casino, meaning that they failed in my self exclusion request.</p>
