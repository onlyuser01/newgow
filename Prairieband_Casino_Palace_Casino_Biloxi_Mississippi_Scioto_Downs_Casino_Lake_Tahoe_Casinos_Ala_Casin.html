<p>Svenska Spel clients who have opted to self-exclude from gambling will be provided with a free Gamban license for 5 years</p>
<p>Svenska Spel, Sweden’s former online gambling monopoly, has formed a new partnership with Gamban, a provider of self-exclusion services and safer gambling tools. Under the deal, Gamban will supply the Swedish state-owned operator with blocking software.</p>
<p>Thanks to the agreement, Svenska Spel clients who have opted to self-exclude from gambling will be provided with a free Gamban license and access to more support through the Gamban app for 5 years. This will help struggling players get their gambling habits under control, minimizing gambling harm in Sweden.</p>
<p>As one of the most influential gambling companies in Sweden, Svenska Spel recognizes the dangers of gambling harm and is actively seeking to protect its customers. The operator has been in business for almost a century and has an extensive presence across the country’s retail and digital sectors.</p>
<p>In addition, Svenska Spel held a monopoly over online gambling for a while, before a licensing system was introduced in 2019.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Is Committed to Protecting Its Customers</p>
<p>Gamban’s director of external affairs, Matt Zarb-Cousin, commented on the new partnership agreement, praising Svenska Spel for its unwavering commitment to protecting its customers.</p>
<p>This partnership reflects Svenka Spel’s commitment to all of their customers playing in a fun, safe and healthy way. Matt Zarb-Cousin, director of external affairs, Gamban</p>
<p>Zarb-Cousin added that he is excited to provide the Swedish operator and its players with market-leading blocking software.</p>
<p>Daniel Harre, a responsible gambling specialist at Svenska Spel, also commented on the matter, saying that his team’s core philosophy is that “if someone is suffering from their gambling they should not gamble at all.”</p>
<p>Therefore, in the rare cases our customers experience this, we’ll offer them a free Gamban license for up to 5 years. We believe that using Gamban may give someone the pause from gambling that is required for seeking help, going into treatment and start recovering. Daniel Harre, responsible gambling specialist, Svenska Spel</p>
<p>In other news, Svenska Spel just renamed its horse games to Svenska Spel Hästar following a dispute with ATG over the name of its trotting venture. The former company ensured its users that the transition would be seamless, promising them that no features would be changed during the renaming.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the company also confirmed its intentions to close its Casino Cosmopol properties in Gothenburg and Malmö because of suboptimal revenues and increasing challenges.</p>
