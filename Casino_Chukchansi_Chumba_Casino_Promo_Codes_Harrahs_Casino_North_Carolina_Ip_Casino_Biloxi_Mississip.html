<p>Sports betting and gaming brand jointly operated by MGM Resorts and Entain BetMGM launched its new commercial campaign across social media platforms, featuring a star-studded cast of actors and athletes.</p>
<p>Part of the Sports Betting Culture</p>
<p>The ‘IT’S ON’ campaign will have its national TV debut on September 8 during Thursday Night Football and will release the other episodes in the coming months, bringing to the fore the roster of BetMGM ambassadors.</p>
<p>“Entertainment is at the core of BetMGM,” said vice president of Brand at BetMGM Raymond Doyle, explaining that the aim of the new campaign is to “keep viewers on the edge of their seats in a way that’s unexpected” from the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Seeking to personify the larger-than-life entertainment brand, the initial spot will feature Jamie Foxx at his suite in Bellagio, looking for sports betting advice from Kevin Garnett, Wayne Gretzky, Jalen Rose, Barry Sanders, and Vanessa Hudgens, while the other series of the campaign will show Barry Sanders playing pickleball at a palatial estate in Malibu, Jalen Rose and his barber, as well as Wayne Gretzky on an ice-practice session with Connor McDavid.</p>
<p>Produced by 72andSunny New York and directed by Peter Berg, executive producer of Entourage and Ballers, the campaign will appear across broadcast, OOH, digital and social channels, while the brand ambassadors will utilize their personal social channels to promote the ads.</p>
<p>“We really wanted to show what makes sports betting so entertaining,” said Peter Hughes, creative director at 72andSunny, outlining that the ‘IT’S ON’ campaign is looking to tap into the viewer’s competitive side while making the audience part of the sports betting culture.</p>
<p>“It’s something you can talk about with friends and engage with in a more meaningful way,” concluded Hughes.</p>
<p>New Ads to Mark Season-Openers and Playoffs</p>
<p>New spots of the campaign are going to be released throughout the year to mark the season-openers and playoffs in the NBA and NHL, as well as tournaments of the NCAA.</p>
<p>While seeking to further engage with sports audiences, BetMGM continues with its efforts to provide responsible gaming education, providing resources to help customers play responsibly. As part of its commitment to responsible gaming, BetMGM endorsed the Responsible Gambling Education Month.</p>
