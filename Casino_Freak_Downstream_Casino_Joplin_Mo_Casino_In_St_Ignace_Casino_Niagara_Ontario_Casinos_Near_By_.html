<p>The leading UK-based bookmaker, Betfred, announced Thursday a new sponsorship agreement. The company confirmed it entered into a multi-year partnership with the largest racing group in the UK, Arena Racing Company, to sponsor the St Leger Festival. Under the terms of the new deal, Betfred will also sponsor the World's oldest Classic, the Betfred St Leger Stakes, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>As a popular bookmaker, Betfred has a long-standing presence in England. Currently, the bookmaker operates more than 1,350 betting shops around the country and is famous as one of the biggest sponsors of sports in the UK.</p>
<p>Outside of the racing vertical, Betfred sponsors British Masters Golf, Matchroom Boxing, and the Rugby League. The bookmaker has a partnership with Manchester United as well.</p>
<p>Betfred is also among the top sponsors within British racing after only recently revealing a sponsorship deal for the Derby and the Oaks as well as becoming an Official Betting Partner of Ascot Racecourse.</p>
<p>Building further the positive momentum, the bookmaker will now sponsor the World's oldest Classic, the Betfred St Leger which first ran back in 1776. This year's Betfred St Leger Festival is scheduled between Thursday, September 14 through Sunday, September 17, 2023.</p>
<p>The latest sponsorship deal marks an important achievement for Betfred. This is because it allows the company to sponsor three out of the five classic races in the country, reaffirming its commitment to supporting the sport and helping it grow.</p>
<p>Martin Cruddace, Arena Racing Company's Chief Executive, shared his excitement saying: "We are absolutely delighted to welcome Betfred as the headline sponsors of the St Leger Festival and of the Betfred St Leger itself."</p>
<p>He added: "Fred Done and his team have long been keen supporters of British racing, and the inclusion of this historic race meeting into their sponsorship portfolio is another indication of their commitment to the sport." Finally, Cruddace thanked Betfred on behalf of the sport and acknowledged the significant support the sponsorship deal brings.</p>
<p>Betfred's Chairman, Fred Done, was similarly excited about the freshly minted sponsorship agreement. He outlined: "To have the Betfred name attached to the St Leger Festival is not just a sponsorship but a privilege."</p>
<p>Last but not least, Done pointed out: "I am proud to be associated with the worldâ€™s oldest classic which is obviously synonymous with great horses like Triple Crown winner Nijinsky, Dunfermline for the Queen and Oh So Sharp for Sir Henry Cecil."</p>
