<p>Provider of casino and sports betting platform and white label solutions Quantum Gaming announced today a distribution deal with developer studio Gamzix to continue expanding its iGaming library.</p>
<p>Refreshing Quantum’s Offering with Gamzix’s Games</p>
<p>The distribution deal between Quantum Gaming and Gamzix, one of the top-rated and most promising slot providers globally, enhances the white label provider’s offering with a portfolio of over 30 unique slots of the highest quality and boasting innovative features, realistic animation, colorful graphics, and impressive payout options.</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic to cooperate with such a fast-growing company,” said the chief executive officer of Quantum Gaming, Oliver de Bono, outlining the exponential growth the online gaming sector has witnessed over the past years and the need “to stand out from the crowd.”</p>
<p>“I believe onboarding partners like Gamzix will definitely help us to achieve that,” de Bono added.</p>
<p>The constant evolution of the iGaming market is setting up high standards for operators to evaluate their current and future partners as among the great number of software companies that are trying to establish a presence in the gaming space, there are only a few that are really up to the task and Gamzix is considered to be one of them.</p>
<p>Adopting an ultra-fresh approach to iGaming development, the developer came up with game titles such as Sunny Coin: Hold the Spin, Rich Granny, Gold Mania, 3X3: Hell Spin, and 3х3: 27 Ways that gained in popularity fast and are now available for Quantum Gaming casino operator partners.</p>
<p>In September, Gamzix came up with a new iGaming title, Pilot, offering players a simplistic game that is capable of taking them up to the stars, expanding the developer’s portfolio to 30 releases with its first crash game.</p>
<p>‘Ready to Bring and Take the Best’</p>
<p>On behalf of Gamzix, chief operating officer Lida Kodosova expressed how proud the studio feels about its team and network of partners that are supporting it.</p>
<p>“Growing and becoming stronger together is such an amazing opportunity we fully trust,” Kodosova continued, adamant that “Gamzix is ready to bring and take the best,” and proud that the studio’s games are now “part of the Quantum Gaming portfolio.”</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt, our cooperation will be successful and prosperous,” she concluded.</p>
<p>The distribution deal with Gamzix is the latest for Quantum Gaming which recently signed a similar agreement with Relax Gaming to offer some of Relax’s most popular titles such as Snake Arena, Money Train 2, Temple Tumble, and others to its white label partners.</p>
