<p>Tico Bingo is a very popular operator in Latin America thanks to the popularity of the bingo games it offers to local audiences. In addition, the operator is famous for its bonuses and loyalty programs that encourage people to pick TicoBingo over its competitors. The best thing is that the company also offers special offers to new players, encouraging them to stay and making sure that they always have something to enjoy.</p>
<p>The company prides itself on being “more than a product.” According to its operations manager, Edmond Robinson Rubinstein, Tico Bingo represents a “fusion between playing, winning and helping” at the same time. The bingo operator’s offerings include titles for all types of people, both traditional and innovative.</p>
<p>Under the agreement with Red Rake Gaming, Tico Bingo will get access to some of the best titles the studio has to offer. This includes premium games such as The Gold of Poseidon, Planet 67, Mega Money, Muertitos, Disco Nights and World Football, among other hits.</p>
<p>Tico Bingo Is Sure Its Fans Would Love the New Games</p>
<p>Nick Barr, Red Rake Gaming Malta’s managing director, spoke about the new agreement with the LATAM operator. He said that his team is delighted to join forces with Tico Bingo and power the company with games. Barr praised Tico Bingo for its loyal following of players and said that Red Rake has a lot in store for the operator’s loyal audience.</p>
<p>As stated by Barr, Red Rake offers a plethora of video bingo, slots, videopoker and table games and has something for any client and end-customer. He added that his team is thrilled to expand in LATAM and boost Red Rake’s growth.</p>
<p>Our games have resonated with players across LATAM incredibly well and our exponential growth shows no sign of slowing down. Nick Barr, MD, Red Rake Gaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Robinson from Tico Bingo added that his company has built a platform that combines quality entertainment with secure payment methods and a superior user interface.</p>
<p>We have sought to generate an evolution of a game so recognized and loved in LATAM, to make it very accessible, easy to use, and that allows users to have maximum fun and win great prizes. Edmond Robinson Rubinstein, operations manager, Tico Bingo</p>
<p>Robinson concluded that the agreement with Red Rake Gaming will allow his team to further enrich its portfolio in LATAM.</p>
