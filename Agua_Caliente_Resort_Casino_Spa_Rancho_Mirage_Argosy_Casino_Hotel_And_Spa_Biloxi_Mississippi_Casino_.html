    <h1>Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa Rancho Mirage Argosy Casino Hotel And Spa Biloxi Mississippi Casino</h1>

<p>I think it will be withdrawn if I wait, but it's been more than two weeks since I applied. At present, I don't feel that the casino's response is very sincere.</p>
<p>It is said that withdrawals will be processed immediately after the verification of the account is completed, but the situation is that the verification of the account is not completed.</p>
<p>April 23 Withdrawal application. Account verification will not be possible from here until the request is contacted.</p>
<p>April 28 Email from verification team to submit account verification documents. Documents sent on the same day.</p>
<p>May 5 E-mail from the verification team to resubmit the documents are incomplete.</p>
<p>May 6 Resubmission of documents.</p>
<ul>
<li>When I logged in to the casino and confirmed my account, the withdrawal was canceled on May 6th.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no contact from the casino regarding cancellation of withdrawal.</p>
<p>I asked support for the reason, but I couldn't get a clear answer. It doesn't seem to make sense to check it, so I didn't mention it.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions state: "If you do not submit the requested documents within 72 hours of the request date, the pending withdrawal will be canceled and the funds will be refunded to your balance."</p>
<p>I submitted this in time so it shouldn't be a reason for cancellation.</p>
<p>May 6 Withdrawal application (re)</p>
<p>May 11 Waiting for account verification to complete. More than 48 business hours have passed since the documents were submitted. No contact or reply.</p>
<p>The withdrawal policy states that it is within 24-48 hours from the request.</p>
<p>According to the support content, withdrawals and account verification hours are usually 24-48 business hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.</p>
<p>No clear explanation when asking support why verification is not complete after 48 business hours. Uncooperative to wait for the verification to finish. (I sent a request to the verification team, but it has no effect)</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, there are many requests and the verification team is doing their best promptly. Looking only at the results, the word has no credibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Direct emails to the verification team do not reply to any questions.</p>
<p>Emails to the contact information regarding the complaints stated in the terms cannot be sent.</p>
<ul>
<li>After sending, at a later date, I received an email with a delivery error saying that it could not be received at the destination (the reason is not clear because there may be multiple reasons).</li>
</ul>
<p>-This is the content from the withdrawal application to the present. -</p>
<p>Do you think it is highly possible that the reason why the current account verification is not completed is due to the withdrawal delay?</p>
<p>I have applied at dozens of casinos so far, so this is often the case, but this time is the longest non-certification period.</p>
<p>By the way, does account verification sometimes require a long working time?</p>
