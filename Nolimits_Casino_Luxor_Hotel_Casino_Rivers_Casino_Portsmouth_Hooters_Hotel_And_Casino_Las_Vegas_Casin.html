<p>Is Buffalo Bills Momentum Fading?</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are 8-3 on the season, with two of those losses happening in November. The same month, they won two games but failed to cover the spread each time. Sean McDermott’s men defeated the Cleveland Browns 31-23 in a game in which they were 8.5-point favorites before the kickoff.</p>
<p>The game in question took place at Ford Field in Detroit, the reason being poor weather in Upstate New York. The same venue saw the Thanksgiving clash between the Bills and the Detroit Lions, in which the visitors from Buffalo won 28-25. They came to Michigan bearing the role of a 9.5-point favorite.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Bills aren’t as impressive as they were at the start of the season. However, they’re still one of the strongest NFL teams and one of the most serious candidates for the Lombardi trophy.</p>
<p>New England Patriots Defense Might Not be As Good as Everyone Thinks</p>
<p>The New England Patriots are 6-5, which is two wins fewer than the Bills who are sitting at the top of the AFC East Division table. The competition in this division is fierce, with the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets playing there alongside these two. That said, New England’s chance of winning the division looks slim.</p>
<p>The best way for the Pats to get to the playoffs is to ensure they have a good record at the end of the regular season. Right now, they seem to be on the good road to getting a Wild Card entry. However, things can change over the next couple of weeks. They got some tough games ahead, meaning that their players will have to step up if they want to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>Mac Jones and the Pats offense have started showing signs of improvement. In their Thanksgiving game, they scored 26 points from two passing TDs and four field goals. Unfortunately, their defense – which is usually very reliable – didn’t have a great day on Thanksgiving. The Vikes completely outplayed them, scoring 33 points that evening.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills vs New England Patriots Prediction</p>
<p>If there’s a team that the Patriots hate playing, it’s the Bills. Buffalo’s record against this team in the last two years is 4-1. The last time these two met was in the 2021 postseason when we saw the Bills obliterate the Pats 47-17.</p>
<p>Quarterback Josh Allen threw 21-for-25 for 308 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions in that game. Running back Devin Singletary also had a fantastic game, scoring two rushing TDs on his own. Knowing that both of these guys are playing fantastic football in 2022, we can only expect the Bills to beat the Pats once again.</p>
<p>Picks: Buffalo Bills to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
