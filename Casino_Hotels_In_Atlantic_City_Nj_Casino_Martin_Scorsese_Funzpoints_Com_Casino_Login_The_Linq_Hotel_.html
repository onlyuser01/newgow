<p>Barcelona and Galatasaray have met eight times in history, with Barca winning seven of those matches. All of those were played in the Champions League, but this time, the two meet in the Europe League. Online sportsbooks see Barcelona as the #1 favorite to win the trophy. Meanwhile, Galatasaray is the biggest underdog.</p>
<p>That said, it’s clear that oddsmakers expect Barcelona to go past the Turkish team easily. However, Galatasaray mustn’t be underestimated. After all, this team has plenty of amazing players on the roster. The question is are they good enough to get something from their trip to Camp Nou on Thursday? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Barca’s Only Chance for a Trophy?</p>
<p>Barcelona isn’t doing great in Spanish La Liga. These guys are sitting in the #3 position with 15 points fewer than table-leader Real Madrid. Sure, Barca has one game fewer than Los Blancos, but still, their chance of winning the domestic title is very, very slim. They’re also out of the Spanish Cup, where they got defeated by Athletic Bilbao in the quarterfinal.</p>
<p>What this means is that the only way for Barcelona to win a title in 2022 is to win the Europa League. That said, you can be sure Xavi’s boys will take the Galatasaray game very seriously.</p>
<p>The good news for Barcelona fans is that this team’s been playing well over the last couple of weeks. They are without a loss since January, coming into the Europa League game after four straight wins. One of those was the 4-2 win over Napoli at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Galatasaray is a Force to Be Reckoned With</p>
<p>Even though Galatasaray is a huge Europa League underdog, this team mustn’t be underestimated. The thing is that there are some amazing players in this squad. Galatasaray’s key men are players in their early 20s whom you might not even heard of – Kerem Akturkoglu, Mohamed Mostafa, Alexandru Cicaldau, and so on.</p>
<p>They might not be famous, but these guys are likely to catch the eyes of scouts from top European clubs in the future. Apart from youngsters, Galatasaray also has some experienced players on the roster, starting with their goalie Fernando Muslera.</p>
<p>The bad news for this team is that several of their players with European experience will miss Thursday’s game. Former Barcelona midfielder Arda Turan is one of them, and the same goes for Sofiane Ferghouli.</p>
<p>That said, Galatasaray might not be able to beat Barca in Spain, but these guys sure have the quality to score at least once. Unfortunately for them, it’s very likely Barca will score even more.</p>
<p>Picks: Barcelona to Win; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
