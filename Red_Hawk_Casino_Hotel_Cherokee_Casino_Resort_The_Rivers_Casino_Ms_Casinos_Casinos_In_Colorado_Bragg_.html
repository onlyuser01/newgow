<p>Bragg Gaming Group announced today Oryx Gaming, a company under the group’s umbrella, received a supplier license in the UK to allow the group to expand its global footprint.</p>
<p>Unmatched Size and Maturity</p>
<p>The supplier license awarded to Oryx Gaming by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) was hailed as a significant milestone for the listed on the NASDAQ and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Bragg Gaming Group, allowing the company to enter one of the world’s most mature online casino markets and substantially increase its global presence.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group chief commercial officer Chris Looney, who joined the company recently, outlined the iGaming market in the UK as an enticing proposition to the world’s leading operators due to its “unmatched” size and “maturity.”</p>
<p>Receiving a UK supplier license offers significant growth opportunities for Bragg as we bring first-class iGaming entertainment to UK players together with local operator partners.” Chris Looney, Chief Commercial Officer, Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Following the decision by the UKGC to award the supplier license, Oryx Gaming will now be able to provide content to a wide range of operators, among which are some of the biggest iGaming brands globally.</p>
<p>Preparing for Launch</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming noted its company had already certified for the UK market an initial batch of Oryx’s best-performing slots featuring in-house studio titles and games from Gamomat. By the end of the year, these games are expected to go live with operator partners in the country.</p>
<p>This license and our pending entry into the UK market before the end of the year will help to accelerate our international growth trajectory and offers another proof point of the success we continue to achieve with the execution of our global market expansion initiatives.” Chris Looney, Chief Commercial Officer, Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming considers the license award and its expected launch later this year as an important step in the group’s expansion strategy, seeking growth in market share across regulated jurisdictions around the globe, including in mature markets such as in the UK.</p>
<p>UK Gambling Market Size</p>
<p>Bragg said the online casino sector in the UK is estimated by H2 Gambling Capital to be the largest regulated iGaming market in the world, with a total addressable market of approximately $5.5 billion (£4.1 billion) in 2021.</p>
<p>In 2022, Bragg Gaming expects the UK market to form just under one-third of its total addressable market, as the group’s global expansion efforts are projected to increase the total addressable market six-fold to over $18 billion.</p>
<p>Among the latest jurisdictions where Oryx Gaming launched was the Netherlands, where Oryx’s content went live with BetEnt’s brand BetCity.nl and Greece, where Oryx launched with Novibet. Following a recent deal with MERKUR, Oryx Gaming is expected to go live in the Czech Republic in mid-Q2 2022.</p>
