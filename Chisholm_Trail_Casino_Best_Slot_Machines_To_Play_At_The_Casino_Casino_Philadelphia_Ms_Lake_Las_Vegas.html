<p>ICE London has been the biggest gambling industry event in the world for several years, and this year’s version is no exception. The conference has commenced today, on February 7th, and will take place until Thursday, February 9th.</p>
<p>The event covers everything in the gambling industry, including land-based and online casinos, betting, bingo, lotteries, payments, eSports, and other verticals. In the online casino sphere, ICE is attended by casino operators, affiliates, game providers, platform providers, payment providers, and all other types of companies that make up the iGaming market.</p>
<p>ICE London's official website quotes an expected attendance of over 35,000 visitors, which tops last year’s numbers and makes it likely the biggest iGaming event to date.</p>
<p>Participants can visit and interact with over 650 exhibitors attending the conference, enjoy over 50 networking opportunities, and take part in other events and activities that make use of gambling industry leaders’ presence in the United Kingdom’s capital.</p>
<p>ICE London’s educational program ICE VOX, which has started on February 6th, includes panel discussions and presentations at the World Regulatory Briefing, the International Casino Conference, as well as four masterclasses for those who aim to tackle certain issues or areas in-depth.</p>
<p>Casino Guru is one of the 650+ exhibitors at ICE with its GAMTEGRITY stand, which promotes efforts related to making online gambling better, safer, and fairer. You can read more in a separate article about GAMTEGRITY and its presence at ICE.</p>
<p>Another industry event taking place at ExCeL London is iGB Affiliate London 2023, which is planned to run from February 8th to 11th. Unlike ICE, iGB is aimed predominantly at affiliate business in online gambling.</p>
<p>Apart from fostering the development of affiliate partnerships, iGB Affiliate London 2023 will host a number of talks and panel discussions related to SEO, affiliate management, emerging markets, social media marketing, and other areas of the business.</p>
<p>Members of the Casino Guru team are attending both events, including a few taking part in the educational agenda. Šimon Vincze is hosting ICE VOX’s Safer Gambling Masterclass, while Petronela Kontos is one of the speakers at Consumer Protection Zone’s panel discussion on Envisioning the role of a Safer Gambling Ombudsman.</p>
