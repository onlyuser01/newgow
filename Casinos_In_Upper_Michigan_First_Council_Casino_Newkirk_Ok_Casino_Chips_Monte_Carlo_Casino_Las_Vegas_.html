<p>Americas Cardroom finishes the year hiring Randy “Nanonoko” Lew as Security Consultant and Gameplay Expert and prepares for 2021 with a $8M GTD Venom event.</p>
<p>A New Addition to ACR’s Team</p>
<p>America’s arguably largest poker website, Americas Cardroom (ACR), will be now working with poker legend Nanonoko, also known as Randy Lew.</p>
<p>The American poker professional and Twitch streamer has been hired by ACR as its new Security Consultant and Gameplay Expert. This staff addition will improve ACR’s image and give customers an extra game security feeling.</p>
<p>The information has been announced last week, and also reports that Lew will collaborate with Winning Poker Network’s existing security staff to target cases of online game fraud as well as bot movements and conducting reviews.</p>
<p>“I’ll be helping ACR becoming one of the best poker websites for you to play at,” commented Nanonoko about his new job.</p>
<p>Lew says he’s ready to help make ACR’s network safer, although he’s currently living in Australia, which restricts him from accessing ACR or WPN platforms. He also said that the work done “behind the scene” to make sure players are safe is as important as “the software, features and big fields.”</p>
<p>Once the Covid-19 pandemic situation is regulated, he will also be called to meet gamers during live events such as Cage Live events in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Famous Venom Tournament is Back</p>
<p>Recently, ACR announced an $8M GTD Venom event for January 2021, as this end of year will be without any huge online poker tournament. The Venom events always offer great guarantees.</p>
<p>For example, the first event was in July 2019, and the prize pool was about $5M GTD ($6,382,500 actual prize pool). Even better: Venom’s prize in December 2019 was about $6M GTD ($6,740,000 actual prize pool) and Venom 3 in August 2020 $7M GTD ($9,680,000 actual prize pool).</p>
<p>The latter had TRT-Vitor as the lucky winner of $1,394,821. Next year’s tournament will start on Friday, January 22 at 1pm, finishing with a final table on Wednesday, February 3, time to be determined. An $8M guarantee has been set, offering the winner at least $1M.</p>
<p>To enter the event, a $2,650 buy-in is asked, but numerous players get their entry via satellites (Venom Fever or Venom Blitz Steps) or tryouts.</p>
<p>For example, each Venom Fever satellite won guarantees seats according to a designated timetable listed on the ACR website. The event started last week with a $95 mega-satellite ensuring 20 tickets and another one is planned to happen on Sunday, January 3 with 20 seats at stake.</p>
