    <h1>21 Casino New Buffalo Casino Horseshoe Casino Black Hawk Casinos Near Sacramento Ca Casino Hotels In</h1>

<p>Retail gaming giant The Cordish Companies announced that it would be the primary development partner for Petersburg’s upcoming casino resort. A unanimous decision by the city council chose the leading gaming operator because of its substantial experience and history of success. The project is a first for Petersburg and aims to revitalize the region’s tourism business.</p>
<p>The Project Is in Safe and Experienced Hands</p>
<p>The Cordish Companies is not a poor choice for Petersburg’s first casino resort. The casino developer is behind some of the USA’s most successful and iconic brands like Live! and Hard Rock. The company has a solid track record of success and continues to manage nearly every business it has created.</p>
<p>Petersburg’s mayor Sam Parham expressed confidence that The Cordish Companies would be the perfect partner to revitalize the city and realize their shared vision, generating opportunities for sustained growth.</p>
<p>An important part of our evaluation was to identify a development partner with a proven track record…, a long history of revitalizing cities…, and strong community engagement practices. Mayor Sam Parham, City of Petersburg</p>
<p>In addition to helping develop the new casino resort, The Cordish Companies intends to engage with non-profit organizations and assist in various fundraising and volunteer projects, aiding the local communities.</p>
<p>The New Resort Will Be a Great Boon for Petersburg</p>
<p>The Petersburg city council puts great hope in the project as it promises to substantially boost the region’s tourism industry and provide long-term economic benefits. These concerns are another reason The Cordish Companies was chosen, as the developer has significant accomplishments in urban revitalization.</p>
<p>The Cordish Companies CEO Zed Smith was optimistic that the planned casino resort would be truly transformative. He offered reassurance that the company was well-versed in urban revitalization and would deliver stellar results.</p>
<p>We share… the Petersburg City Council’s commitment to create a world-class entertainment destination… that will… create thousands of new jobs and benefits to the local community. Zed Smith, CEO of The Cordish Companies</p>
<p>Smith also emphasized that the casino resort would be a mixed-use project with the potential to bring millions of dollars in tax revenues, promote economic development, and turn the city into one of the region’s premiere tourist destinations.</p>
<p>So far, the project appears to be in safe and capable hands. The Cordish Companies has won seven Urban Land Institute Awards for Excellence for its accomplishments and has completed many other similar ventures. If everything goes according to plan, Petersburg will soon enjoy a brand new transformative destination resort that will be a great boon to local communities.</p>
