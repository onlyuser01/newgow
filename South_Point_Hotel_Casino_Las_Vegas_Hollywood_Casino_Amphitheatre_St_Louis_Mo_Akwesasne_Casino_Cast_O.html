<p>Naturally, not all betting sites are worth your while. Instead, we will focus on those that provide you with great betting markets, fair odds, and transparent service. There are many such properties that have been around for years. Pinnacle, Luckbox, Rivalry, and Betway are just some of the pioneers but they’re not necessarily the best today.</p>
<p>To make it in the list above, each site had to meet selective criteria that are upheld by only a select few sportsbooks worldwide and our above recommendations do exactly that. We follow a careful reviewing process to help you pick the best gambling site. Here is what we use to make up our minds.</p>
<p>Variety of CS:GO Betting Markets</p>
<p>We expect each site to bring us plenty of CS: GO markets to bet on. This includes outright winners, prop bets, totals, and in-play wagers. The best betting sites have mastered that, with BetOnline and BetUS offering tons of live betting opportunities alongside their regular ones. Market variety is important to CS:GO fans as they want to have more than a single moneyline wager to place.</p>
<p>Trust, Reputation, and Licensing</p>
<p>Gambling sites in general want to be seen as trustworthy and reliable choices. That is why we make sure to compare all websites and look up their track record, reputation, and whether they hold a license. The majority of esports betting operators actually do, and this shouldn’t surprise you. They operate as legitimate brands and want to be perceived as such. That is why we only stick with those reputable names that meet industry benchmarks.</p>
<p>Easy and Hassle-Free Navigation</p>
<p>Esports fans are keen on having smooth navigation at any betting site, and that is why the best options make sure to always provide players with nice and easy navigation. The entire platform should feel easy to navigate and work without any hiccups. You want to have a frictionless experience whether you are betting on live markets or regular CS:GO games.</p>
<p>Excellent Live Betting Opportunities</p>
<p>In-play markets are popular options for CS:GO betting. In other words, esports fans love to bet on games while they are in progress. This boosts the satisfaction from an event and even drives more people to tune in and watch. It also opens up some interesting opportunities to place a wager that will usually be settled very quickly. Live CS:GO betting is very popular, and fans do expect to see these options available.</p>
<p>Boosters and Fair Odds</p>
<p>Individual CS:GO games can sometimes get boosters at BetOnline. Boosting the odds means that you can find more valuable picks on the underdogs, although the chance of them winning is still slimmer. Boosters are interesting types of promotions to explore, and many CSGO gambling sites have them ready for you to try. We pay careful attention to these promos to determine if an operator is giving bettors a fair chance.</p>
