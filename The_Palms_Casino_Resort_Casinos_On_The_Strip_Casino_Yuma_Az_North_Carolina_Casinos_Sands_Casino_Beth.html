    <h1>The Palms Casino Resort Casinos On The Strip Casino Yuma Az North Carolina Casinos Sands Casino Beth</h1>

<p>Hey!</p>
<p>This is how it is. I opened an account on www.wisho.com which is the sister site of www.winnerz.com and started playing there. I won a little and lost a little but was able to get money out of it. Then I started an account on www.winnerz.com and played there, there it was exactly the same. Then I lost about 10,000 euros in total on winnerz and got back 10% cashback of just under 1,000 euros, which I then withdrew. After that I blocked myself on both sides. A few weeks after that I wrote an email to winnerz where I asked to open the account again where they asked some questions regarding my playing and then they opened my account right away. But my account on wisho remained closed and blocked. I made a total of 6 deposits of which each deposit was 5,000 euros, so a total of 30,000 euros! On the last deposit, they temporarily closed my account because they wanted to know where the money came from and to verify the account. Which is completely understandable. When this happened my sanity took hold and I panicked so I wrote to them that I am addicted to gambling and want all my deposits back. Which I know doesn't work. But in any case, they asked me to send in a lot of documents and information, which I did. I also asked to at least get back the 10% in cashback that they had as a policy. They more or less promised me this during our email contact all that was needed first was for my account to be verified. After all the documents and information they asked for were submitted, I was asked to wait for their response which would arrive within 72 hours. Which I did. After exactly 72 hours, I get an email where they write that my account is verified and ready but that I cannot get this 10% due to the fact that my account is blocked and that I had money left in the game account when this cashback was to be paid out , which did not match.</p>
<p>I still have all emails and information that have arisen during this discussion with the casino.</p>
<p>I really hope you can help me with this so that I can at least get back the 10% of all the deposits I made. Which they promised me.</p>
<p>Best regards, Claes</p>
