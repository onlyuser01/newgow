<p>Relum and Gamzix have established a new partnership intended to throw bridges across different shores of the iGaming experience and help create a mutually-beneficial and successful collaboration. Relum specializes in the delivery of innovative API solutions whereas Gamzix is an innovative and fast-rising slot games provider that brings fresh, energetic, and creative slot and gaming content.</p>
<p>Gamzix has been gaining prominence globally and expanding across different markets. To this day, the company has produced more than 50 compelling games, as a press statement confirms. Gamzix combines different genres of the iGaming experience and has developed an excellent library of crash and slot machine games, offering players robust gameplay paired with brilliant graphics and "immersive soundscapes."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Relum has been able to become a true ambassador of iGaming having built a library that now features more than 14,000 games. This has been done to assure that the company will focus on catering to every player's taste and preference, bringing high-quality slots and innovative products to partner operators and casinos.</p>
<p>The aggregation solution by the company has turned into a powerful, agile, and efficient way to introduce players to new experiences. This is not where the platform’s support ends, however. Relum also uses advanced promotional and analytical tools that help partner suppliers elicit stronger results and get valuable read into what works and doesn’t work with players, which is precisely what Gamzix will have access to itself.</p>
<p>These tools benefit all parties involved as they help drive smart business decisions while also elevating the level of fun that players are having and enjoying themselves. Thanks to Relum’s powerful platform, everyone involved in the process of implementing or playing a Gamzix title is getting the best experience possible.</p>
<p>"The dedication of Gamzix to creativity, quality, and innovation speaks to us. We look forward to offering their variety of slots through our game aggregation," said Relum CEO Emil Hakobian who was very pleased with the opportunity to see Gamzix become one of the latest partners to the platform.</p>
