<p>Hunter Holman, 27, of North Las Vegas, is scheduled to go before a Las Vegas judge on May 24.</p>
<p>The charges come from incidents in two states that took place last year through this February. He was apprehended on March 21 and remains in federal custody.</p>
<p>Holman was charged with two hate crimes and two counts of assault with the use of a deadly weapon motivated by bias or hatred toward a victim, as well as a single count of child abuse or neglect. He could face many years in prison if found guilty of the charges.</p>
<p>In one incident, he allegedly attempted to drive into a Black family near the Marriott Grand Chateaux in Las Vegas. He charged at the group and later punched a man, authorities said. The man, in turn, allegedly stabbed Holman with a pocket knife to protect himself and his family, which included an eight-month-old baby, police said.</p>
<p>Holman suffered wounds during the struggle, including “a puncture near his belly button,” police said.</p>
<p>Placed Goat Head, Knives in Freezer</p>
<p>Holman also placed a goat head and many knives in a freezer in a room at an Extended Stay America in Las Vegas, authorities said. His motivation for doing so remains unclear.</p>
<p>At another Las Vegas hotel, Holman also threatened to shoot people. He also told a hotel employee that he was “king of the KKK.”</p>
<p>In another instance, he allegedly threatened to injure Blacks at Esporta Fitness in Little Rock, Ark. He allegedly called the fitness center as many as 15 times a day and once threatened to shoot an employee with an AR-15-style rifle. He was believed to have formerly worked at the fitness center.</p>
<p>Holman was arraigned in federal court on a transmission of a threat to injure charge in connection with that incident. If found guilty, he could face as much as five years in prison, as well as a $250K fine and three years supervised release.</p>
<p>Last May, Holman was fired from his job at a Las Vegas call center, identified by media reports as Vegas Stronger. That led him to make numerous phone calls to the center, during which he allegedly used racial slurs.</p>
<p>At one point during the last year, Holman also claimed to be Jesus and an FBI agent, Las Vegas TV station KVVU reported.</p>
