    <h1>Turtle Creek Casino And Hotel Casinos Michigan No Deposit Welcome Bonus Casinos Hotels In New Orlean</h1>

<p>Good evening, CasinoGuru team, I fear something is very wrong here. About the topic:</p>
<p>I had 3 withdrawals pending at the same time (2x150€, 1x100€). after 2 had been processed and paid out (0:44 a.m. email confirmation) there was still one over 150€ open. when i got back to the casino my account was at 0€ and the pending payout was cancelled. I immediately contacted chat support and asked for clarification. I then checked the course of the game and noticed that at 2:30 a game was played for €150 and my balance was played to €0 in a very short time. The last game I played in this casino was Fire Hopper. The chat support said there will be an exam but it looks like it was me. I can only swear that I've never done anything like that. It is simply in my opinion a fraudulent act to deprive me of my payout. I have never and would never play such amounts, especially since it was also in the payout. I had no major problems with the casino before but this shocks me badly and is hard to believe. Also have a video of the first chat contact. I had asked for it to be sent to me via email, but that didn't happen. I myself have no way of looking at login behavior, MAC address and IP. I would be very happy about your help and can only say again that I have never played such amounts and have been waiting for this payout.</p>
