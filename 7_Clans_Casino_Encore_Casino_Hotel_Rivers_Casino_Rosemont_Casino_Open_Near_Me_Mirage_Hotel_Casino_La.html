<p>Projects That Are Under Development Are Also Included in the Deal</p>
<p>As the details of this arrangement between GAN and Red Rock Resorts state, not only will all Nevada locations be provided with mobile, retail and online sports betting services, but the deal also includes the properties that are currently under development. However, the necessary technical certifications by regulators, as well as additional gambling licenses, will have to be obtained.</p>
<p>Thomas Mikulich, the Senior Vice President of Innovation and Slots of Station Casinos, stated that the reason why the company chose GAN is that it has a proven technology platform, massive reputation for providing bettors with a fantastic wagering experience, its experience with integrating various rewards platform, and lastly – the overall commitment.</p>

He said that after going through a competitive and comprehensive process, the company is delighted to secure its first well-known and reputable retail casino operator in the US and provide its omnichannel technology on sports betting as well as the solution on managed trading services that was acquired at the outset of the year.</p>
<p>Smurfit concluded by saying that GAN’s worldwide team is happy to finally enter the US market on sports betting next year with a bang as it partnered with Nevada’s market leader. After all, the progress comes at a perfect time since online sports betting in the US is currently undergoing a massive expansion. The number of states that have accepted this new form of wagering is increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>Station Casinos is Also Expanding in Nevada</p>
<p>Recently, Station Casinos got the green light to build a resort in the southwest valley. The new property will go by the name Durango and its main focus will be casino gaming. This property is long overdue as its original plans were formed back in 2008. According to the latest data, Durango is set to be finished at the end of 2023.</p>
<p>However, locals in the area have expressed some concerns about the possible increased traffic and other disturbances in the area.</p>
