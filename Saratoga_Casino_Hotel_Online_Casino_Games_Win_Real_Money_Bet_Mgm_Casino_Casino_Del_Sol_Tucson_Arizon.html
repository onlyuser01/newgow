<p>BetMGM has introduced the one-stop-shop entertainment solution Borgata Arcade to the Borgata Online Casino in New Jersey, the United States. The Borgata Arcade is set up as a unifying experience that brings together a variety of iGaming titles and genres, including LuckyTap, Slingo, and scratch games, along with branded and multi-themed slots that together create a unique experience for the player.</p>
<p>The Borgata Arcade is accessible through an individual tab in the gaming lobby at Borgata Online, making it easy to navigate. The website itself is built to cater to desktop, iOS, and Android players all across New Jersey.</p>
<p>Presently, the suite features more than 120 games, with the numbers growing. Amongst the noteworthy titles are such picks as Space Invades, Ghost Busters Triple Slime, and Monopoly. The Borgata Arcade also features a Power-Up prize leaderboard that allows players to grab bonuses of up to $1,000.</p>
<p>This adds to the outstanding selection of 1,500 games already available at Borgata Online along with the exclusive jackpots and other opportunities awaiting at the casino. BetMGM is also firmly committed to raising responsible gambling standards and uses GameSense, an innovative RG program by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, to protect consumers in the most robust way.</p>
<p>BetMGM VP of Gaming Agnus Nisbet has welcomed the opportunity to see this partnership form. The popular brick-and-mortar casino format is now taken to the realm of online experiences, confirmed by Nisbet with this unique adaptation of some of the land-based industry’s most popular games.</p>
<p>"The selection truly captures the fun and excitement of an arcade, and we look forward to bringing it to even more of our customers soon," Nisbet said. BetMGM Chief Revenue Officer Matt Prevost was similarly excited about this opportunity and the chance it presented to players.</p>
<p>"Borgata Arcade offers an all-in-one place for players to find their favorite games," Prevost said adding that arcade experiences remain a highly coveted part of the experience and will now live on as part of Borgata Online’s offer.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Borgata Online has been adding games from a number of prominent suppliers. One of those is White Hat Studios, an established powerhouse in the iGaming market in the United States which has been building up its offer steadfastly to offer some of the most worthwhile experiences to local players and beyond.</p>
