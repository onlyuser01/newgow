<p>Wilds From The Crypt review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Wilds from the Crypt online slot from Kalamba Games invites players to explore a spooky mansion and look inside the family crypt to see what secrets it has in store.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Despite its obvious appeal, there are not as many horror and ghost-themed slots on the market as you might imagine. As such, the Wilds from the Crypt slot stands out visually. It has a great design, with a haunted mansion sitting in the background, omitting a purple glow. The family members make up the premium symbols on the reels, with a haunted skull-faced man acting as the Wild and Multipliers. The slot feels like it has taken inspiration from the Addams Family, only with a slightly more sinister twist.</p>

<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game of the slot keeps the action quite simple. It uses a six-by-four grid with forty fixed paylines on each spin. Wins are made when players land matching symbols of three or more across a payline. The controls are all located under the reels, with a burger menu opening up the paytable and other key information.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are several bonus features players can enjoy in the Wilds from the Crypt slot. Firstly, you will want to keep your eyes peeled for the Potion symbol. This is collected whenever it lands. With every tenth spin, the number of collected Potions is converted into Expanding Wilds on the grid.</p>

<p>You will also want to keep your eyes out for the Wilds and the Wild Multipliers, as both of these can land and expand on the reels on any spin.</p>
<p>The main bonus in the game is the Free Spins round. This is triggered when you land three or more Book Scatter symbols. Expanding and Sticky Multiplier Wilds will appear throughout the round, with the multiplier corresponding with a number displayed above the reels.</p>
<p>The game has a HyperBet feature where players can increase their stake for the Multiplier Wilds to start on a higher number, and for a higher number of free spins when the round launches. There is also a buy bonus option available.</p>
