<p>I use both forms of my name Frank and Frankie and they say because they are not the same on my documents that they cannot pay me</p>

<p>Frank is the short form of Frankie and is used on most of my utility bills - I have a residence in the US (*** ) from which I signed up - and my utility bills there have my short form of my name Frank - I sent them a copy of my bank statement that has my full name and my address, but my CC statements all have the short form of my name Frank</p>
<p>I think that this is a stupid excuse not to pay me what I won - I have been trying to get this money since April 14 the KYC took a long time. with many excuses like the credit cards used were not in focus on the form. - the form date wasn't signed in ink etc. Now its my name is not the same. I hope you can help me out with this</p>
