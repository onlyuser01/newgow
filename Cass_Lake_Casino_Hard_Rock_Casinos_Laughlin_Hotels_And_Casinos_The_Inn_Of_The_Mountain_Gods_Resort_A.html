<p>The famous professional American football team based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the San Francisco 49ers, has announced a new agreement by teaming up with the leading Mexico-based casino brand with more than 15 years of experience, Foliatti Casino. Under the terms of the new collaboration, labeled as the first of its kind, the football team seeks to connect with more players in Mexico.</p>
<p>Per the new strategic collaboration, Foliatti Casino was designated as the presenting sponsor of the 49ers via the team’s Spanish-language website. A free-to-play game will grant Spanish-speaking fans unique engagement opportunities, enabling them to compete each week for prizes such as casino credit or unique merchandise, among other prizes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the duo confirmed their intention to organize different activations. One such activation would be an official 49ers Watch Party where Foliatti Casino will be a presenting sponsor. The event is expected in the upcoming months and will cater to NFL and 49ers fans alike in Mexico.</p>
<p>The latest agreement covers Foliatti Casino’s land-based casinos that are located in Monterrey, Guadalajara and the State of Mexico. According to 49ers, Arbol Media together with Wasserman Latam were tasked with the sales and activation initiatives under the terms of this collaboration. Foliatti and the 49ers vowed to disclose further details regarding upcoming events in Mexico in due time.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Marks a Milestone Deal for the 49ers</p>
<p>Pamela Loman Huerta, Foliatti’s operations director, spoke about the growing popularity of American football in Mexico. She explained that the latest collaboration represents a unique opportunity for the 49ers to connect with their growing fan base in the country. “The 49ers Faithful are remarkably passionate, and we look forward to showcasing our state-of-the-art casinos with them, while creating new joint experiences for our players and VIPs,” explained Huerta in conclusion.</p>
<p>“Our collaboration with Foliatti Casino represents an exciting milestone as the first partnership of its kind.“ Ryan Connors, senior director of the San Francisco 49ers</p>
<p>Ryan Connors, the San Francisco 49ers’ senior director, deemed the new collaboration as an important milestone. “We’re thrilled to be pioneering this path with an authentic Mexican brand like Foliatti Casino, and grateful that it will enable us to engage with new communities in Mexico and provide unique experiences for 49ers Faithful across the country,” he explained in conclusion.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration is expected to further propel the reach of the 49ers in Mexico. The new partnership comes on the heels of other recent activations in the country that included fan rallies, watch parties, as well as a youth camp organized by the 49ers Foundation.</p>
