<p>Following a comprehensive investigation, we wish to inform you that the closure of the user's account was a result of severe violations of our terms and conditions, specifically associated with fraudulent activities and document forgery.</p>
<p>The decision to close the user's account and suspend payouts is grounded in clear evidence, as outlined in the following clauses of our Terms and Conditions:</p>
