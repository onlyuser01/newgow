    <h1>Oneida Casino Hotel Lucky Star Casino New Orleans Casinos Pechanga Casino Resort Ocean Casino Atlant</h1>

<p>I've been playing at many casinos for years. At first, I did not pay attention to the license. After some problems with the payout, I have been playing MGA casinos for two years now. Lured by bonuses, I am always ready to sign up for new casinos. So also with BOOCASINO</p>
<p>I have with my money + bonus (deposit 50 euros + 150% bonus) earned a profit of 5000 euros. I mainly played Immortal Romance with 3 Euro bet.</p>
<p>After the win, I had a strange feeling, because the verification of my account was very strange. I know these processes and Boocasino has made it really complicated. Allegedly, I have always been sent emails, which should ask me to submit documents. However, I never received them (not even in spam). Strangely, all the others arrived for example advertising emails. Only through the chat I was able to verify the account. I was very skeptical. In the terms and conditions was that the profit expires, if not within a period, the account has been verified. That's why I put pressure on the employee in the chat so I get a verification. In the saved chat history, I have the promise of verification.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I was struck my profit because I allegedly violated the stakes against the terms and conditions. This is not the case. I can and must speak of fraud here. I have already contacted the MGA and asked for help.</p>
<p>It does not make sense that you classify Boocasino as serious! The opposite is unfortunately the case. I think it's blatant that son can happen an incident with a MGA license. So far, I had full confidence in MGA licensed casinos.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
