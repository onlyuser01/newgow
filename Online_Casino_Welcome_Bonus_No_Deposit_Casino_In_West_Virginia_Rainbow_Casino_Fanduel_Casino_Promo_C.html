<p>The 2022 Army-Navy game is on the program on Saturday afternoon in the City of Brotherly Love. This is going to be the 123rd game between the two rivals, as well as their 90th duel to take place in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The Navy Midshipmen lead the all-time series 62-53-7, as well as have a better score in games played in Philly (45-40-4). Their most recent game was also won by Navy, but before that, the Army Black Knights were on a great roll with four wins and one loss.</p>
<p>Are we going to see Army get back onto the winning track or will Navy win for the second time in a row?</p>

<p>Army Black Knights Looking for Their 6th Win of 2022</p>
<p>The Army Black Knights are 5-6 this season, with wins over the Villanova Wildcats (49-10), Colgate Raiders (42-17), UL Monroe Warhawks (48-24), UConn Huskies (34-17), and UMass Minutemen (44-7).</p>
<p>As you can see, when the Black Knights win, they blow out their opponents. Still, one should keep in mind that all of their 2022 wins happened against teams that are very poor in defense.</p>
<p>When playing against rivals that have good defensive teams, Army usually doesn’t do that great. In fact, in five of their five losses of the season, we saw them score under 20 points. The obvious next question is whether the Navy Midshipmen have good enough defense to stop the Black Knights?</p>
<p>All Eyes on Navy’s Defense</p>
<p>It’s very likely the Midshipmen won’t do great in the offense in the Army-Navy game on Saturday. The thing is that they’re without their starting quarterback Tai Lavatai who suffered a season-ending injury on October 29.</p>
<p>Since then, the Midshipmen are 1-2 with Xavier Arline in the role of their starting signal-caller. Although he hasn’t been great in terms of passing, he’s been pretty decent rushing-wise scoring a TD in each of his previous two games.</p>
<p>That said, we should expect Navy to score a couple of TDs, but not too many. Instead, the key to victory in Saturday’s game is to do well defensively. So, can they tame Army’s offense?</p>
<p>The Midshipmen are 4-7 on the season with 24.77 PPG against them, which makes their defense the fourth-best in the American Athletic Conference (ACC).</p>
<p>Army vs Navy Prediction</p>
<p>There shouldn’t be too many points in this game. We expect to see no more than four TDs in total, which is why one of our picks is “under 33”. And what about our Army vs Navy moneyline pick? It’s really a coin toss, this one. Still, we’re gonna go with Army, the no.1 reason being that Navy will miss its arguably best ball-thrower.</p>
<p>Picks: Army Black Knights to win; under 33 points</p>
