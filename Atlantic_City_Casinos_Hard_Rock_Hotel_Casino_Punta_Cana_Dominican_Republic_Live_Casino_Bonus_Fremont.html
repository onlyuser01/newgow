<p>Online Sports Betting Moves Ahead in Argentina’s Neuquen Province</p>

<p>Eventually, the company wants to expand into other regions in Latin America. Eduardo Nanton, general manager of Casino Magic, revealed in a recent statement that the company has “ambitious plans.” But he did not go into details.</p>
<p>Kambi Group will provide technology and services to Casino Magic over several years for the sports betting initiative.</p>
<p>“It is a partnership with real promise, as we aim to realize the potential of regulated sports betting in Argentina,” Kristian Nylen, CEO of the Kambi Group, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Like in the US, Argentina regulates sports betting regionally. In the Latin American country, betting is overseen by provincial governments.</p>
<p>In Neuquen Province, Casino Magic and Kambi worked on tailoring the technology “to satisfy the compliance requirements” in the region’s regulated market, Nylen said.</p>
<p>Growth Potential Seen in Argentinian Online Gaming</p>
<p>As of September, the total gambling market in Argentina was estimated to be worth $415 million, Gaming Innovation Group said last year. Just 7 percent of the total market is from online operations, so there is significant growth potential in the online gaming sector, the company predicted in September.</p>
<p>Specifically, in the city of Buenos Aires, tax revenue from the physical casinos collapsed when faced with impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Government officials hope that through online gaming, they will be able to bring in around US $5 million in tax revenue per year, Mark P. Jones, a political science fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute, told Casino.org in September.</p>
<p>“This is not a huge amount. But given the economic crisis facing Argentina, every little bit helps,” Jones said last year.</p>
<p>Online Gaming Taxes More Than Double</p>
<p>Late last year, Argentina’s national government approved a higher tax rate for online gaming. Taxes on online gaming jumped from 2 to 5 percent, according to a report from SBC Americas, a Latin American news organization.</p>
<p>Other Latin American countries may also expand into online gaming. Those nations would make a decision based on gaming and revenue projections, Jones said.</p>
<p>Betting on US baseball began expanding in the region. In July, Costa Rican sportsbook Betcris secured a multi-year deal to become an official wagering partner for Major League Baseball in Latin America.</p>
<p>It marks the first such agreement for MLB in a market that’s critically important for the sport.</p>
<p>As far as Argentina, soccer, known locally as football, or futbol in Spanish, is popular, according to April Yoder, an associate professor of history at the University of New Haven.</p>
<p>“It’s their most popular sport and a lot of the best players end up in the big European leagues,” Yoder told Casino.org.</p>
