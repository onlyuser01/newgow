<p>Play’n GO has expanded its footprint in the Italian iGaming market by teaming up with Lottomatica, a respected local powerhouse that offers online casino titles, lottery, and sports betting options in the country.</p>
<p>Lottomatica Receives Content Boost by Play’n GO</p>
<p>As a result, players in the country will be able to access a variety of Play’n GO titles brought directly through the Lottomatica brand including such all-time hits as Book of Dead, Tome of Madness, and Rise of Olympus all available to play.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new partnership opportunity, Lottomatica product development senior manager for betting and digital, Alessandro Rainaldi, said that the brand was fully focused on making sure that it provides consumers with the best possible products and provide them with memorable gaming experiences.</p>
<p>One of the ways to do that is to turn to trusted and respected brands in the industry such as Play’n GO. Rainaldi argued that there were few suppliers that came even close to the quality offered by Play’n GO and that the team at Lottomatica was impressed with the strong understanding the company exhibited when approaching market content needs for Italy.</p>
<p>Play’n GO Magnus Thalin, global head of sales at the company, was equally pleased with this opportunity. He reaffirmed Play’n GO’s commitment to working with established names in the gaming and gambling sectors globally. Lottomatica, he said, “absolutely fitted the bill.” He added:</p>
<p>We both share a firm belief in delivering great entertainment in a responsible and sustainable way, and we’ll work closely together on these priorities over the coming months and years. Play’n GO Magnus Thalin, global head of sales at the company</p>
<p>Market Growth Focus of Play’n GO’s Efforts</p>
<p>Play’n GO has been present in the market for a while as well. In fact, the company made its debut in Italy all the way back in 2018 and has been a staying power in Italian iGaming. Not even the reduction of exposure to the gambling industry scared the supplier away. Play’n GO regional director for Southern Europe and Latam, Emilie Zamponi, also welcomed this development and said that landing another top-tier operator in Italy was important.</p>
<p>Play’n GO remains committed in the meantime to pushing and expanding its market reach in multiple markets across Europe, including Spain and Greece on top of its clear commitment to the Italian market. Elsewhere, Play’n GO is determined to break even further ground in the Latin American market through the upcoming G2E expo next week when the company will be exhibiting for the first time and hoping to make its name to more local operators.</p>
