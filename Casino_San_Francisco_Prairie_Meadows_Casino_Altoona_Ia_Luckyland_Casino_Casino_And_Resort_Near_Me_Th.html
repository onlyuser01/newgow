    <h1>Casino San Francisco Prairie Meadows Casino Altoona Ia Luckyland Casino Casino And Resort Near Me Th</h1>

<p>I signed up for BitSpinWin (https://bitspinwin.co/) off of a referral link from a friend. As part of the sign up process, they verify you by having you submit a picture of the front and back of your ID along with a selfie of you holding the ID. They offer a sign on bonus of $20.00, but you are only eligible to receive the sign on bonus if you provide the above mentioned photos and they meet their requirements.</p>
<p>I received the sign on bonus in which they stated you only have to wager the original sign in bonus. According to their site, the minimum withdrawal is $20.00 and to be eligible for a withdrawal, you must add your bitcoin address to your file.</p>
<p>I managed to get my winnings up to $100.00 and requested a withdrawal. I received an email stating that further verification was needed. They told me I needed to submit a picture of myself holding my ID and a piece of paper with the name of the platform I won on and the date. I submitted my photo and it was denied saying it wasn’t clear, I then continued to have to submit subsequent photos of the same thing, and kept getting denied. My last denial then asked for just a custom photo of my ID so I submitted a picture of the front of my ID. Again my withdrawal was denied. Keep in mind that they verified me in order to receive the sign on bonus and there is nowhere listed on their website indicating this is their process.</p>
<p>I am now thinking BitSpinWin is some sort of scam even though they have some reviews on Trust Pilot.</p>
<p>I’m glad I didn’t choose to deposit any money.</p>
<p>i happened to notice on the bottom of the emails they send that the following address is listed.</p>
<p>2005 16TH #2</p>
<p>Austin Texas 79022</p>
<p>USA</p>
<p>Because I was growing skeptical, I researched this address.</p>
<p>This zip code is for a town called Dalhart, Texas which according to Google is an 8 hour and 45 minute drive from Austin, Texas. J</p>
