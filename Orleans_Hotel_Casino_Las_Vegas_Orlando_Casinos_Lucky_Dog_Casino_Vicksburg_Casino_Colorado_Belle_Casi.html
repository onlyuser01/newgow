    <h1>Orleans Hotel Casino Las Vegas Orlando Casinos Lucky Dog Casino Vicksburg Casino Colorado Belle Casi</h1>

<p>Set to open its doors in the course of the year, Live! Casino’s new property in Westmoreland has begun to prepare to deliver on all its promises. Owned and operated by the Cordish Gaming Group which is one of the divisions of the renowned The Cordish Companies, the new facility is one of the most anticipated developments in the Keystone State. Things have just gotten more exciting after the owners and operators of the upcoming gambling operator decided to enlist an industry veteran for the Westmoreland operation.</p>
<p>Sean Sullivan, the industry veteran in question was earlier this week appointed by the Cordish Gaming Group to become the General Manager of the new $150 million Live! Casino in Westmoreland County. In his new role, Mr. Sullivan will be responsible for overseeing the daily activities, operations as well as the management of the Live! Casino property which happens to be the very first one to go live in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Over 40 Years of Experience</p>
<p>Needless to say, since this is the first time the Cordish Gaming Group is venturing into the Keystone State’s gaming market with its Live! Casino offering, it was very important that they involve someone who has enough experience in that market. With over 40 years of experience in the gambling industry, the new Live! Casino Westmoreland General Manager has held a number of leadership positions with some of the most popular gaming operations in the country.</p>
<p>“Under his leadership as General Manager, we are confident the new Live! Casino will become the premier gaming and entertainment destination in the Pittsburgh market and deliver the same excellent customer service that guests have come to expect at all our Live! locations,” Rob Norton, President of Cordish Gaming Group stated.</p>
<p>Sean Sullivan’s most recent role was as the Vice President and General Manager of Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino in Washington, Pennsylvania. He spent close to 10 years in that role and was able to assist the company to grow in several different ways.</p>
<p>Speaking of growth, this is exactly what the Cordish Gaming Group was looking for especially now that it is doubling down on its expansion efforts. Having an industry veteran to help their facility in Pennsylvania sail through the competition and some of the hurdles that may arise will definitely be a huge advantage for the business.</p>
<p>Highlights of Live! Casino Westmoreland</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the upcoming Live! Casino property has been generating a lot of buzz not just because of its exciting features but also because of the mind-blowing revenue figures that have been thrown around. In addition to featuring amazing gaming features, the property will a significant economic impact right from the construction phase.</p>
<p>About 960 jobs will be available during that stage and this translates to about $148 million in economic impact. Once it finally goes live, the gambling destination is expected to create an annual economic impact of a whopping $180 million. Now that is definitely worth the wait.</p>
