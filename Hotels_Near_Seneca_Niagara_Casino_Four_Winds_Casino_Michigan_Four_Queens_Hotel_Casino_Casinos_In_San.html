<p>The deal with Livespins will provide Wazdan enthusiasts with an entirely new way to experience the developer’s content</p>
<p>Wazdan, a developer of big action iGaming titles, has agreed to provide the socially-charged betting platform Livespins with its games. As a result, players can now enjoy a more social Wazdan experience.</p>
<p>Livespins adds a social element to slots by streaming the spins live to the audience, with a streamer or brand ambassador taking the role of a host. Bettors can directly take part in the action and be directly involved in the spins while commenting on the developments in a chat. The chat is further spiced up with a rich variety of emojis and reactions players can use to better convey their emotions.</p>
<p>While Livespins offers a shared experience, players are still able to choose their own bet value and number of spins.</p>
<p>The Livespins experience includes content from many top-tier studios, such as Yggdrasil, Relax Gaming and iSoftBet. This lineup will be further reinforced with the addition of Wazdan’s thrilling games.</p>
<p>The integration notably includes some of Wazdan’s top performers, such as 9 Coins, Power of Sun: Svarog, Hot Slot: 777 Rubies, Magic Spins and Burning Sun.</p>
<p>Players Will See Wazdan’s Games in a New Light</p>
<p>Wazdan’s chief commercial officer, Andrzej Hyla, commented on the agreement. Hyla believes that streaming is already an integral part of contemporary culture, which is why it should be embraced. The CCO said that Livespins has found a way to leverage the popularity of streaming while providing exciting gaming experiences to its players in a responsible and sustainable way.</p>
<p>Hyla noted that Livespins’ approach to gambling is very appealing to modern audiences and said that he is looking forward to seeing streamers spin Wazdan’s titles.</p>
<p>Michael Pedersen, Livespins’ chief commercial officer, also commented on the matter. He noted that almost all iGaming enthusiasts would have heard of Wazdan and its incredible slots. Because of that, Pedersen believes that the current deal is one of his company’s most important integrations yet.</p>
<p>He added that players will now be able to enjoy the studio’s thrilling titles in a new and more social way.</p>
<p>This is what makes Livespins unique and why developers such as Wazdan want to be part of our innovative product. It really is changing the game by providing an entirely new way to experience online casino. Michael Pedersen, CCO, Livespins</p>
<p>Livespins has been steadily expanding its portfolio of streamed slots by penning agreements with notable developers. In January, the company secured iGaming content from Gamzix. It also formed strategic alliances with Yolo Group, EveryMatrix and M88.</p>
