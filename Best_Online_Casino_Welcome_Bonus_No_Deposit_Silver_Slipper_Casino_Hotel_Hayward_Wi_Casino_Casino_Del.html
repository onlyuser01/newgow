<p>Jake Paul vs Anderson Silva is a professional boxing match that will take place at the Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday, October 29, 2022. This is going to be the sixth bout for Paul, who’s got a 100% record as a professional pugilist.</p>
<p>His opponent, who is 22 years older, has a 3-1 boxing record, but he also has an extensive MMA portfolio. In fact, Silva is one of the legends of the UFC, having held the title in his possession more than any other fighter in the history of the promotion (2457 days).</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it seems that Saturday’s bout is going to be the toughest challenge Paul’s ever had. Nevertheless, he’s still seen as the favorite in the eyes of the bookies.</p>

<p>Jake Paul to Show He’s the Real Deal</p>
<p>Jake “Problem Child” Paul has a 100% win record in boxing, but there’s a caveat – he still hasn’t fought against an opponent with an extensive experience in this sport.</p>
<p>So far, he’s fought the following rivals:</p>
<p>AnEsonGib (Youtuber)</p>
<p>Nate Robinson (ex-basketball player)</p>
<p>Ben Askren (ex-MMA fighter and wrestler)</p>
<p>Tyron Woodley (ex-MMA fighter and wrestler)</p>
<p>Paul defeated each of them by KO/TKO. Woodley is the only one who he defeated twice. First, it was by split decision; the second fight finished with Paul knocking Woodley out.</p>
<p>Despite having a decent MMA portfolio, Woodley wasn’t famous for striking in his UFC days. Instead, wrestling was his strongest weapon. Literally the same goes for Ben Askren, while Nate Robinson and AnEsonGib had only limited boxing experience before going inside the ring with Paul.</p>
<p>Problem Child did want to fight a real boxer, but every time, something caused the bout to get canceled. His clash with Tyson Fury’s little brother Tommy was canceled due to Englishman’s visa issues. Next, Paul was supposed to fight against Hasim Rahman Jr., but the fight was canceled due to “weight issues”.</p>
<p>Anderson Silva Mustn’t be Underestimated</p>
<p>Silva’s MMA career ended in 2020, with a record of 34-11. Twenty-three of those 34 wins happened by KO/TKO, which is another proof that he’s a great striker. Further, knowing that he’s lost only four fights by this method, Paul will have serious problems trying to put him to sleep.</p>
<p>In his MMA days, Silva fought against real knockout experts such as Israel Adesanya, Daniel Cormier, and Michael Bisping. None of them managed to knock Silva out.</p>
<p>Since 2020, Silva hasn’t fought in the UFC, but he did fight two boxing bouts, winning both of them. He defeated Tito Ortiz by KO and Julio César Chávez Jr. by split decision. Chávez Jr. is a professional boxer whom Silva defeated twice – in addition to the 2021 win, he also did it in 2005.</p>
<p>Silva’s only boxing loss happened even before that. It happened in 1998 when he retired against Osmar Luiz Teixeira.</p>
<p>Jake Paul vs. Anderson Silva Prediction</p>
<p>Jake Paul was six months old when Anderson Silva made his MMA debut. Problem Child was one year old when The Spider fought his first boxing bout. With 46 MMA fights under his belt, as well as four boxing bouts, Silva has so much experience that it really is surprising that he’s not the betting favorite in Saturday’s clash.</p>
<p>But, even if Paul had more experience with fighting against established boxers, we’d still back Silva. The Brazilian is winning this bout within distance.</p>
<p>Picks: Anderson Silva to win by knockout/technical knockout</p>
