<p>The mystery visitor is from Texas. It was the first time he had ever been to Resorts Casino Hotel.</p>
<p>He was playing an IGT Wheel of Fortune 4D Collector’s Edition progressive slot when he won $1,265,086.80.</p>
<p>Thursday’s payout was the largest jackpot so far this year at Resorts Casino Hotel. It also represents the first jackpot of more than $1M won at the property since September 2021.</p>
<p>Resorts Casino Hotel opened in 1978. It has more than 1,300 slot machines and numerous table games.</p>
<p>$727K Won in Michigan Casino</p>
<p>A Michigan man recently won $727,270 on a slot machine at the Gun Lake Casino. It’s a record payout for the Wayland, Mich. gaming property.</p>
<p>The guest, simply identified as “John,” who resides in Grandville, Mich., won the money on August 25.</p>
<p>The progressive payout was from an Ultimate Fire Link Explosion machine made by Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>Here at Gun Lake Casino, we were thrilled by the payout to the lucky guest from West Michigan of over $727,000,” casino general manager Jose Flores said in a statement.</p>
<p>Gun Lake Casino opened 12 years ago. It’s owned by the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians (Gun Lake Tribe).</p>
<p>The gaming property has more than 2,500 slot machines, 47 table games, and a poker room.</p>
<p>Gun Lake Casino broke ground last year on a $300M, 15-story hotel tower and six-story Aquadome. That’s a domed pool and entertainment complex. It’s scheduled to open in March 2025.</p>
<p>Win Just Shy of $10K</p>
<p>A Palace Station Hotel and Casino guest recently won $9,999.99 on a slot machine at the off-Strip property in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The unnamed player won the payout on August 29.</p>
<p>The person came up with three lucky seven symbols on a Double Gold slot machine.</p>
<p>It’s made by WGS.</p>
