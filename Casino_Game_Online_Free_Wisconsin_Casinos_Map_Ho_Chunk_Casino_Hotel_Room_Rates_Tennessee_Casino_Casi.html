<p>The Star Entertainment Group was deemed unsuitable to hold a license by the Queensland State Government for its casinos located in Brisbane and Gold Coast. The decision came Thursday and follows an extensive review of The Star’s Queensland operations that started in June this year.</p>
<p>Probe into The Star Queensland Finds Deficiencies</p>
<p>The Palaszczuk Government released the final report outlining the result of the probe into The Star Entertainment’s Queensland operations. The in-depth evaluation and review was conducted by the expert Honorable Robert Gotterson AO KC. In his review, Gotterson identified a wide range of issues and deficiencies. At the same time, he issued 12 recommendations that seek to enhance the integrity, minimize harm, restore the confidence in the public for The Star’s operations and ensure the compliance of the operator.</p>
<p>Although the Queensland Government deemed The Star unsuitable to hold a license, this doesn’t mean that the operator would need to discontinue its operations. Instead, the operator is given a chance to follow the recommendations outlined by Gotterson and supported by the Queensland Government. In other words, The Star can ensure its compliance with the regulation and avoid tougher measures such as license revocation.</p>
<p>The Operator Is Given a Chance to Remedy the Situation</p>
<p>Shannon Fentiman, the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, acknowledged that based on the findings of the review, The Star is unsuitable to hold a license. She explained that in line with the current legislation, once it was determined that The Star is unsuitable to hold a license, it is also given the opportunity to remedy that and ensure compliance.</p>
<p>“Considering the serious and concerning findings of the Gotterson Review and his advice regarding suitability, I have formed the view that The Star is unsuitable to hold a license in Queensland.“ Shannon Fentiman, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice</p>
<p>Attorney-General Fentiman added that the Palaszczuk Government supports the recommendations of Gotterson’s review into The Star’s Queensland operations. She thanked Gotterson and the other experts involved in the comprehensive review process. At the same time, the Attorney-General acknowledged that ensuring the compliance of the Queensland casinos is a top priority for the local Government.</p>
<p>“Making sure Queensland casinos operate lawfully is a priority for the Government,“ added the Attorney-General</p>
<p>The recommendations outlined by Gotterson include the appointment of a Special Manager that will seek to ensure the compliance of the casinos’ operations and supervise integrity. Additionally, the recommendation calls for the creation and implementation of a Safer Gambling Code of Conduct. The operator would also need to make efforts and ensure that no self-excluded individuals can access the venues.</p>
