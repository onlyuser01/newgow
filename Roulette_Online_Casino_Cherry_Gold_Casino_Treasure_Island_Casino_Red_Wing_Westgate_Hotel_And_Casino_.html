    <h1>Roulette Online Casino Cherry Gold Casino Treasure Island Casino Red Wing Westgate Hotel And Casino</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play, a company known for its industry-leading solutions and innovative portfolio of games, has announced a new, dedicated, and branded game for 1xBet, Casino Guru News learned in a press release shared via email.</p>
<p>The pair have teamed up to create a bespoke Live Casino game show that will be available to 1xBet players exclusively and bear the branding of the operator. In Wheel of Luck, players will have the opportunity to enjoy different gaming experiences and experience the live casino vertical as a whole in a new and refreshing way.</p>
<p>This new show will strengthen the existing portfolio of bingo, scratch, and slot games which are already available at the operator. Pragmatic Play has put a lot of effort into building a worthwhile title that will help 1xBet elevate its standing with players and put a firm foothold in the live casino vertical.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Chief Operating Officer Irina Cornides has welcomed the opportunity to see her company work with 1xBet. The Wheel of Luck game concept is based on the studio’s existing Mega Wheel format.</p>
<p>The new release, though, is a one-of-a-kind version that is tailored to meet 1xBet’s player preferences and expectations. 1xBet’s Maria G was similarly excited about the partnership and she welcomed this opportunity to see the operator strengthen its portfolio with the innovative product:</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has delivered exceptional, player-favorite Live dealer products for us since we took its Live Casino portfolio four years ago, and this will only be strengthened with our very own bespoke game.</p>
<p>Maria welcomed the chance to see the operator continue to strengthen its portfolio with yet another exciting supplier, and the bespoke experience that is Wheel of Luck.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pragmatic Play has been working hard on expanding its presence in other markets, including Switzerland, where the company rolled out its content and products with GAMRFIRST.</p>
<p>Speaking of live casino games by the studio, Pragmatic Play recently signed up a similar content partnership with Bally’s, but the studio shared its existing portfolio instead of crafting a unique show.</p>
