<p>Interactive gaming and sports betting company Elys Game Technology announced today that its footprint in Ohio would be expanding via an exclusive partnership with Wright Bet.</p>
<p>Local Businesses to Get Their Fair Betting Share</p>
<p>Elys Game Technology and Wright Bet signed an exclusive agreement to operate multiple sportsbooks in Ohio for which Elys’ wholly-owned subsidiary USBookmaking would manage risk and provide bookmaking services.</p>
<p>Delighted to be able to expand Elys’ footprint in the state of Ohio, Michele Ciavarella, executive chairman of the Toronto-based tech company outlined the company’s desire to “contribute to the grassroots economy by partnering with local businesses” and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Elys Game is looking to replicate its successful Washington, D.C. business model in anticipation that the state of Ohio could also allow venues that are non-conventional such as bars, restaurants and other small businesses to offer sports betting services within their establishments.</p>
<p>“We believe that our cutting-edge Gameboard technology puts Elys in a league of its own as a first mover and pioneer in the U.S. small business sportsbook sector and continuing to support minority and women-owned businesses.” Michele Ciavarella, Executive Chairman, Elys Game Technology</p>
<p>Pending licensing by the Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC), the state could see up to 12 sportsbook locations operated by the Elys Game and Wright Bet partnership.</p>
<p>‘Next Level of Interactive Gaming Experience’</p>
<p>Equally excited at the opportunities this partnership presents, Wright Bet co-founder Dr.Morar stressed Elys’ years of industry know-how in operating sportsbooks at non-conventional gaming venues and that “very few companies in the industry” have the capabilities to offer the technology and focus “to be implemented into smaller more private facilities such as local establishments.”</p>
<p>“Our vision with Wright Bet Ventures is to bring the sportsbook experience into our community without altering the identities of the local establishments with which we partner. Our goal is to create the next level of interactive gaming experiences for Ohioans while we are enjoying events with friends and family in the comfort of places we already know and love.” Dr. Morar, Co-Founder, Wright Bet</p>
<p>Seeking to expand its small business sportsbook solution across the nation, Elys is leveraging its extensive experience across regulated markets to power the underserved network of non-conventional sports betting locations and establishments with its technology.</p>
<p>The anticipated launch in partnership with Wright Bet in Ohio, the second for the Canadian-based technology firm following its initial launch in Washington, D.C. could drive significant economic recovery in the state, spurring employment growth while enticing more patrons to the establishments to help local businesses rebound from the pandemic impact.</p>
