<p>The fast-growing provider of online games, video bingo and video slot games, Zitro, expanded further its global reach after announcing a new partnership. On Wednesday, the company confirmed it entered the regulated gambling market of Croatia under the terms of a new deal with Luckia, a leading provider of games of chance, live table games and slot machines in the country.</p>
<p>The new deal represents a landmark moment for Zitro as it marks the company's debut in Croatia. Under the terms of the new deal, customers of the Zagreb Casino can now enjoy some of the most popular and successful slot games provided by Zitro.</p>
<p>Luckia customers in Croatia will also benefit from the engaging features, as well as prizes offered by Zitro's titles. According to a statement released by Zitro, the leading slot games use the Fusion Glare cabinet. Those titles deliver exciting and engaging features that have already proven their popularity in leading markets around the globe, explained the leading provider.</p>
<p>Jaime Aníbal, a representative of Zitro, shared his excitement about the latest partnership with Luckia in Croatia. He said: "We are delighted to be able to offer some of our greatest hits in Croatia for the first time with Luckia and we are very grateful to them for betting on our products, also outside our borders." Finally, Aníbal noted: "We are fully confident that Link King and Link Me will succeed in Croatia just as they are succeeding worldwide."</p>
<p>Pedro Rodríguez, Luckia's Country Manager, was similarly excited about the deal with Zitro. He explained: "Link King and Link Me are truly amazing products, both for players and for us as operators. It is certainly a very attractive option to diversify the full range of games that we at Casino Zagreb make available to our customers."</p>
<p>Back in January, Zitro inked another major deal after joining forces with CIRSA, a gaming operator that has a strong presence in Mexico. The deal saw Zitro's popular Mega King games arrive for the gambling operator's casinos in Mexico. Those titles delivered new and engaging experiences for CIRSA's customers.</p>
<p>After that, later in January, Zitro expanded its team by hiring the services of Mike Mitchell. Joining the company, Mitchell was selected for the role of Distinguished Designer. At the time of the announcement, Zitro confirmed that he will spearhead the company's efforts in terms of game content and hardware design for the US gambling market.</p>
