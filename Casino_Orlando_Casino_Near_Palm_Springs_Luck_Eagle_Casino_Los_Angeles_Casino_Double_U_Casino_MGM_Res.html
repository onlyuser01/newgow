<p>MGM Resorts Allegedly Swindles Change From Unsuspecting Gamblers, Federal Lawsuit Claims</p>

<p>MGM Resorts International has been named in a lawsuit filed in Mississippi’s Southern District federal court. The plaintiff, a gambler, claims MGM is stealing millions of dollars each year from unsuspecting patrons through voucher redemption kiosks.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts has been sued for issuing “TRU Tickets” instead of change at the casino operator’s self-service kiosks. The “TRU Tickets” can only be redeemed at a staffed cashier cage. (Image: Twitter)</p>
<p>In an effort to reduce high-touch transactions amid the pandemic, MGM and many other prominent casino operators did away with dispensing change in their self-service cashier kiosks.</p>
<p>When a voucher — say $14.34 — is redeemed through an MGM kiosk, the machine dispenses only $14 in bills. The device then issues the patron another voucher for 34 cents, which can only be exchanged at the casino cage with an actual person dispensing the change.</p>
<p>That change, most of which goes unclaimed according to the lawsuit, adds up quickly in MGM and the other casinos’ favor, so claims plaintiff Leane Scherer.</p>
<p>Casino operators enter into hundreds of thousands of transactions a day. When a casino starts taxing players by refusing to refund cash change, it racks up millions of dollars in profits,” attorneys representing Scherer wrote in the suit.</p>
<p>Scherer is seeking damages, a class action resolution, and attorney and legal fees. MGM Resorts has not commented publicly on the litigation.</p>
<p>Customers Unaware of Being Short-Changed</p>
<p>The only way for a gambler inside an MGM Resorts casino to fully redeem their voucher if it includes amounts less than a full dollar is to visit the casino cage and deal directly with a cashier. Scherer says many gamblers are unaware of that condition, as the tickets do not tell the holder that change will not be dispensed at a self-service kiosk.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that casinos, like many other businesses, dealt with a coin shortage amid the pandemic and efforts to curb high-touch transactions. Many casinos, the litigation continues, decided to store all of their change in their actual cages instead of spreading the coins among the many kiosks.</p>
<p>Wynn Las Vegas kiosks since mid-2020 have come with a sticker that reads, “Machine only dispenses cash, ticket will print for change. Please take ticket to the cashier to redeem.” But MGM has been far less forthcoming, Scherer alleges.</p>
<p>“For the last few years, Defendants have essentially been keeping the change off of hundreds of thousands of Gaming Vouchers, essentially robbing their customers a few cents at a time, on millions of transactions,” the lawsuit contends.</p>
<p>Beau Rivage Site of Incident</p>
<p>Scherer’s lawsuit was filed in Mississippi because she allegedly incurred her wrongful losses at MGM’s Beau Rivage Resort &amp; Casino in Biloxi.</p>
<p>Scherer claims she checked in to the casino on June 14, 2022. After putting $40 into a slot machine and losing more than half, she opted to cash out, and the terminal issued her a voucher for $18.19.</p>
<p>After redeeming the voucher at a kiosk, she was given only $18 and a “TRU Ticket” in the amount of 19 cents. Scherer claims she was unaware of what to do with the “TRU” receipt and left the casino.</p>
<p>Scherer claims she visited and gambled inside other Biloxi casinos not operated by MGM during her trip and received exact change from those kiosks.</p>
