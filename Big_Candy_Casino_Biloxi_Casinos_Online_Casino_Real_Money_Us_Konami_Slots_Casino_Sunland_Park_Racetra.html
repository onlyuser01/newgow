    <h1>Big Candy Casino Biloxi Casinos Online Casino Real Money Us Konami Slots Casino Sunland Park Racetra</h1>

<p>My withdrawal was approved and sent on Tuesday, April 20th in the afternoon. Once sent via Bitcoin, it is in my wallet no more than 5 hours later. Usually within an hour. I’m not sure what their Bitcoin processor did but none of the payouts sent on Tuesday are confirmed according to the blockchain and there seems to be no confirmation in site. They won’t do anything about it blaming the blockchain when the reality is that transactions stuck this long are unlikely to confirm at all. The fee is on the low end but high enough to be included in the next few blocks so something else wasn’t done right and they won’t even look at it or resend. Totally unacceptable. I used Bitcoin several times in the last two days, every transaction confirmed in less than an hour and this is not normal. They need to resend and bump the fee up instead of doing nothing. For all of the payouts sent on Tuesday.</p>
