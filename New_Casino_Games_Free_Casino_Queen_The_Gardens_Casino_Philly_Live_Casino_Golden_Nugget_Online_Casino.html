Revpanda has undergone exponential growth over the last two years since the company was created. Debattista will work directly with Revpanda CEO co-founder Emre Goktas who welcomed the new COO:</p>
<p>“Glenn has a unique set of skills and a mentality that aligns perfectly with our goals and aspirations at Revpanda. Our company has been undergoing a rapid expansion and bringing in Glenn as COO will help us continue to scale our products in a sustainable fashion that enables us to deliver on key performance benchmarks while upholding our company culture. We are excited to welcome Glenn as part of our family of Pandas!” Revpanda CEO Emre Goktas</p>
<p>Commenting on this unique opportunity, Debattista shared his excitement to be part of Revpanda’s further growth as he writes the next chapter of his professional journey:</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to be joining Revpanda in the next chapter of my professional journey, at a stage where they are taking the next step to build on the success of the past two years and grow even further into a bigger company. I am looking forward to work with talented people like Emre and his team to turn this into a success story for us all.” Revpanda COO Glenn Debattista</p>
<p>Debattista’s career goes back to 2003 when he started in the industry as a sports journalist. He joined MyBet.com’s and started working as a risk management team leader for three years and nine months there.</p>
<p>Well-Seasoned Veteran with the Right Track Record</p>
<p>He later joined Stanleybet Group and worked in various positions for the better part of ten years, including as risk manager team leader, and trading manager of retail and online business. He formed the iGaming Professionals in Malta (IGPiM), a Facebook group dedicated to professionals from the industry who live and work in Malta.</p>
<p>Debattista would then continue on his way to Web International Services Ltd. which he quit to join Revpanda and bring to the company close to two decades of experience.</p>
<p>Revpanda has sponsored numerous events, including the iGB Amsterdam and SiGMA iGatherings, and won the AGS Marketing Agency of the Year award in 2021. The company stayed the course and landed two additional prizes at the AVA Digital Awards in 2022. Revpanda has offices in Riga, Latvia, and is also opening an office in Malta.</p>
