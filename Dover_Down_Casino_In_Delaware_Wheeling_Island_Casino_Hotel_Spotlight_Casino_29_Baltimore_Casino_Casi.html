    <h1>Dover Down Casino In Delaware Wheeling Island Casino Hotel Spotlight Casino 29 Baltimore Casino Casi</h1>

<p>SkillOnNet is growing its content reach by adding Gaming Corps, a prominent cutting-edge Sweden-based iGaming studio, to its list of partners. As a result, SkillOnNet-powered brands will have access to fresh and innovative online casino content.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps and SkillOnNet Team up for More Content</p>
<p>Gaming Corps prides itself on the fact that it has been able to create a number of next-generation titles that will dovetail nicely with SkillOnNet’s network of leading online casinos. The company will provide SkillOnNet and third parties with a number of select iGaming titles that include Multiplier and Mine titles, which will now be incorporated into partner casinos’ offerings as well.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has focused a big part of its efforts to build visually compelling games that are underpinned by cutting-edge technology and math to make the whole thing come again. The studio argues that there is a good win potential in its titles, with some of the most popular picks, including Clumsy Witch, JetLucky 2, Skyliner, and Coin Miner among others.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet has a network of prominent partners, that include PlayOJO, Slotsstars, Genting Casino, EU Casino, Mega Casino, Metal Casino, Spin Genie, AHTIGames, and many other established brands in the market. SkillOnNet has been able to feature more than 3,500 games on its platform, including jackpot and classic slots, video slots, live dealer options, bingo and instant win games, table titles, and so much more. Commenting on this brand new opportunity, SkillOnNet Jani Kontturi said:</p>
<p>Online casino players are looking for new online casino experiences alongside playing traditional slot games, and this deal with Gaming Corps allows us to strengthen our portfolio with more quality slots as well as next-generation mine and multiplier titles. SkillOnNet Jani Kontturi</p>
<p>Kontturi remained confident that brands that are powered by SkillOnNet remain competitive and manage to garner an advantage that allows them to stay ahead of the pack. Adding Gaming Corps is just another opportunity to continue maintaining this advantage.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps to Get More Exposure through SkillOnNet</p>
<p>Gaming Corps head of commercial Danielle Calafato was equally pleased with the development. Becoming a part of SkillOnNet’s reputable network was a welcomed development for the company, Calafato noted. The company has an ambitious plan to continue bringing cutting-edge titles to bear and to make sure that its concepts and development process is on par with industry standards and customer expectations.</p>
<p>More engaging titles are coming down the road, both branded and regular ones, Calafato assured in a press release.</p>
