    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tulsa Online Casinos Real Money Empire City Casino Best Casino Bonus Casi</h1>

<p>Dear Emanuel,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the T&amp;Cs carefully and this is what I found: "Only one account per user/player, per household, phone number and IP is permitted. The creation of multiple accounts will result in the suspension, closure and/or auditing of the account (s)."</p>
<p>Please understand that it is strictly forbidden in the majority of the casinos to have more than one account. As you admitted, you girlfriend has opened an account from the same IP address. This has been recognized by the casino as breaching the T&amp;Cs and your active balance was confiscated. Unfortunately, there is not much I can do for you in this case. If there is any additional info you would like to share with me, please do not hesitate to contact me. Otherwise I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
