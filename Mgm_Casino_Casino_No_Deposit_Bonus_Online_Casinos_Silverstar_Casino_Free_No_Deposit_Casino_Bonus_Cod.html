    <h1>Mgm Casino Casino No Deposit Bonus Online Casinos Silverstar Casino Free No Deposit Casino Bonus Cod</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>i created an account on this casino and used the free 50 free spins no deposit and i managed to wager and went up to 100 euros, which was the max win.</p>
<p>Before playing, i verified email.</p>
<p>Just after finishing wagering, i entered my contact details because i wanted to verify my account, deposit and be able to withdraw my winnings.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my account was blocked.</p>
<p>I contacted the support and after couple days, they reply to me that my account was closed because of the terms and conditions 14.6 which says this:</p>
<p>"We are, at any time (and notwithstanding any other provisions contained in the Terms of Use), entitled to close Your Account and terminate the Terms of Use on written notice (or attempted notice) to You using Your Contact Details. In the event of any such termination by us we shall, subject to paragraph 13.7, as soon as reasonably possible following a request by You, refund the balance of Your Account."</p>
<p>I had no explanation of the reason, i did not do anything wrong.</p>
<p>I know they closed my account simply because i won for free and it was easier for them to close it using this paragraph which to me is totally unfair. You cannot close an account of a player like that without a valid reason.</p>
<p>They can close my account if they want but after paying me my winnings even if i did not deposit since they stopped me from it.</p>
<p>Why propose no deposit bonus if it is to close the account of the player in case he wins. It is ridiculous.</p>
