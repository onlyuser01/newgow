<p>ICE London has returned with the event getting under way on Tuesday, January 7, and reuniting the world’s gambling elite in one place</p>
<p>Following a rough few last years, ICE London is back in its full glory, and in fact surpassing expectations. The event now stretches 51,466 square meters of net space, up on the 49,690 square meters ICE London held in 2020.</p>

<p>Even though it has only got started, the event has been hailed by attendees, who were impressed with the overall atmosphere. Indian Gaming Magazine editor, Robert Page, who was visiting for the sixth time, said that the whole thing was “electric” and that international visitors were excited to be a part of the gathering and explore new opportunities. Page added:</p>

<p>He also noted that tribal communities and gaming operators are now more active at ICE, which was another reason to be happy. Clarion Gaming managing director Stuart Hunter was equally happy with this assessment and the general turn-up at the event. He hailed the opportunity to see so many visitors from so many countries attend the event and share in its many good aspects.</p>
<p>There is a “proliferation of new ideas” and a “world-beating networking opportunities,” Hunter explained. He added that to his mind this was the biggest and most worthwhile concentration of gaming innovators and representatives from the sector.</p>
<p>I am delighted that so many visitors from so many parts of the world appear to be with us on the opening day. ICE has fantastic energy, there’s a proliferation of new ideas, world-beating networking opportunities and of course, the very best concentration of gaming innovators and suppliers to all sectors of the business. Clarion Gaming managing director Stuart Hunter</p>
<p>The event itself will be running through Thursday, February 9, and it has so far attracted more than 35,000 visitors, along with 650 exhibitors from the industry.</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming has done much to make this edition of the event worthwhile and memorable, with a special Consumer Protection Zone truly taking off during the latest edition and emphasizing the importance of maintaining a responsible gambling industry. This and more can all be explored on-site the ExCel London.</p>
