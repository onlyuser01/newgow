<p>The global gaming company and leader within the growing industry, International Game Technology (IGT), was recognized for its Economic, Social and Governance (ESG) efforts. The company said Monday that it scored in the 88th percentile within the gaming and casino industry category of the 2022 S&amp;P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).</p>
<p>The prestigious recognition acknowledges the company's ESG efforts. Within the casino and gaming industry category, IGT was one of the 69 companies that have gone through an assessment. According to a statement released by IGT on February 27, 2023, the company "demonstrated strong performance against its peers in environmental and social reporting and operational eco-efficiency."</p>
<p>The leading global sustainability benchmark was established back in 1999 when the CSA collaborated with Dow Jones Indices, which is now known as S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Implementing an industry-wide approach leaves no industry excluded from the CSA benchmark. Currently, companies from 61 different industries are being assessed, while active members have helped highlight companies recognized as ESG leaders.</p>
<p>According to the recent announcement, IGT received an overall ESG score of 52 on January 20, 2023, from the S&amp;P 's CSA. This score recognized positive change as improvement was observed when compared to the previous assessment of the company. The ESG score itself derives from "more than 25 financially relevant sustainability criteria across economic, environmental and social dimensions," explained IGT.</p>
<p>Wendy Montgomery, IGT's SVP, Marketing, Communications and Sustainability, shared her excitement saying that the company remains committed to its ESG and global sustainability efforts on a global scale.</p>
<p>"This improved ranking from S&amp;P Global provides insight on the impact of our sustainability efforts and helps IGT remain 'Ahead of the Game' when it comes to sustainability best practices," she outlined. Finally, Montgomery said: "This enhanced score reassures our stakeholders that we continue to demonstrate industry leadership in global sustainability."</p>
<p>The latest recognition comes after recently, IGT expanded its reach in Nevada after announcing a new multi-year partnership with the leading British bookmaker, Betfred. Per the terms of the new deal, the company agreed to provide its leading PlaySports technology that helps mobile, as well as retail businesses grow and provide engaging experiences for their clients.</p>
<p>Before that, early in January, IGT confirmed it has gone live with PlaySports tech in Ohio. The launch coincided with the launch of legal online sports betting in the state which was completed on January 1, 2023. The aforementioned entry expanded further the reach of IGT.</p>
