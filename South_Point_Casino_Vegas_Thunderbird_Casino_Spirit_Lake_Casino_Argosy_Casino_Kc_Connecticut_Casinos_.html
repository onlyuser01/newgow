<p>Checkd Dev is back with a new season of its acclaimed fantasy sports product through the Sky Sports Fantasy Football platform. The overhauled app has improved overall functionality, allowing players to join leaderboards and track results in real-time, and is built directly for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Improved Product aiming at Future Growth and Innovation</p>
<p>As an improvement on the previous version, all updates will happen in real-time rather than having to wait a day before important metrics can be announced. Checkd Dev has borrowed various customer management solutions from Sky Betting &amp; Gaming to improve the overall platform’s consistency and opportunities for further engagement and growth.</p>
<p>A fully responsive website is also planned for the beginning of the 2021/22 flight soccer season. The new app is one of the numerous projects that Checkd Group, the parent entity for Checkd Dev, is working on. Commenting on the progress made so far, Checkd Dev managing director Adam Patton had this to say:</p>
<p>“Sky Sports Fantasy Football is a game and a brand that is loved by football fans throughout the UK, and the opportunity to completely redevelop the technology and apps was one we jumped at the chance to be involved in.” Checkd Dev managing director Adam Patton</p>
<p>Patton explained that the new platform allowed future scalability as it has been rebuilt with the idea of additional growth, stability, and improved overall features. The new app is a testimony, Patton added, to the Checkd Dev team’s ability to deliver products that are able to stay relevant and fare well against technological innovation for years to come.</p>
<p>He was joined by Sky Bet senior product manager Luke Lockwood who argued that the Fantasy Football solution was essential to deliver Sky Bet’s full vision for the industry. Lockwood argued that Sky Bet was happy with the quality of the resulting product and was looking forward to how players receive it.</p>
