    <h1>Online Live Casinos Hotels Near Seneca Niagara Casino Casino Cherokee Harrahs Casino Biloxi Flandrea</h1>

<p>Replacing Chinese high rollers and casino-goers in Macau would take some effort, and the Special Administrative Region (SAR) is keen to make hay</p>
<p>The changes in the regulatory landscape in Macau mean that local casino operators would have to double down on their efforts to attract an international casino crowd. They won’t be going it alone, however, as the Macau Government Tourism Office (MGTO) is similarly looking to help further boost tourism.</p>
<p>MTGO Expands Trip.com Collaboration Yet Another Year</p>
<p>Therefore, MGTO and Trip.com are expanding a previously negotiated partnership and will focus on boosting marketing operations so that it can promote Macau as a tourist destination worth visiting. Foreign travelers will get a number of great incentives to come to the SAR, including additional overnight accommodations and other benefits.</p>
<p>To help further enthusiasm and interest in the SAR’s tourist destinations, the MGTO will make certain hotels in Macau will offer better incentives for such international travelers. The extended partnership will cover a several-month promotional period which has already got underway and will run through June.</p>
<p>Trip.com users will benefit from discounted rates, with savings running within $75. A fair bit of promotional money will also go into furthering the reputation of Macau as a worthwhile tourist destination is set at around $81 million, which will now go into pushing the marketing scheme and bringing more travelers.</p>
<p>MGTO director Maria Helene de Senna Fernandes has hailed the opportunity to see this project through:</p>
<p>We will continue to collaborate with our trusted partners on marketing campaigns with the aim of empowering visitors with the most up-to-date travel information and exciting deals. MGTO director Maria Helene de Senna Fernandes</p>
<p>Good Track Record Motivates MGTO to Pick Trip.com</p>
<p>Trip.com is an alternative to other popular websites, such as Expedia and Booking. There is no clear reason why this site has been picked over the other two services, although Trip.com may just have a better profile in places such as Thailand, Singapore, and South Korea than the rest.</p>
<p>Besides, the MGTO and Trip.com have already a successful track record of collaborating together and bringing around positive and meaningful change. A previous campaign set in 2020 and titled “See You in Macau” brought around the expected results and emboldened the MGTO that such marketing and promotional schemes are indeed striking home with the right audiences.</p>
