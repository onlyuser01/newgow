    <h1>Dodge City Casino Casablanca Resort Hotel And Casino High 5 Casino Free Coins Red Cherry Casino Wind</h1>

<p>I'm happy too inform you of a update on this complaint. ... okay so here's the whole Sha Bang.... I've never had a problem with this casino ever. I've made tons of deposits and alot of withdrawals with no problems never not one... until that is I had my account hacked and someone took 85$ and withdrawal it. I think I got hacked from a telegram group in which I linked my account with so I made it an emergency for the casino to stop all withdrawals while I enabled 2fa and changed password. I made the changes and then began playing 2 or 3 months down the road which would be now I hit a big planko which was roughly 1760.00$ in ltc. I made a 1500$ withdrawal just a couple months before this with no issues. This time was different they wanted me to kyc the account to enable withdrawals and in the mean time withdrawals would be disabled. .... it's been 4 days now and I'm struggling not worried about what's going to happen but here's the thing I sent in my kyc twice now and they won't get back too me... I'm from the usa and reading from other peoples complaints from the usa that had these same things happen and still received their funds my story is different you see I joined in March 2021 before usa was a restricted juridiction on the website which was added Aug 2021 and I've never been advised or informed that usa was restricted until I started reading the complaints so I just want to say I did not try to fraud this casino in anyway and I hope they do the right thing I have deposited over 100k over the years with this casino and I hope for the best but there you go the whole Sha bang!!!</p>
