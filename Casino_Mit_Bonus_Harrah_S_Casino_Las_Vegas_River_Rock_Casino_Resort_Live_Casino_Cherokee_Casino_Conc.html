<p>AvatarUX, an established iGaming supplier for the industry and innovator in the vertical, has signed a new content alliance with Relax Gaming in a bid to strengthen its product and brand reach. Relax Gaming is adding AvatarUX’s unique titles to its Silver Bullet platform to strengthen the product variety it brings to players.</p>
<p>AvatarUX is a studio that has been building up its offer rapidly over the past four years. Launched in 2019, the company has introduced many groundbreaking concepts, including PopWins, MultiPop, and StickyPop, and others, all designed to elevate the gaming experience for players.</p>
<p>AvatarUX CEO Nicola Longmuir has welcomed the opportunity to join one of the most esteemed content aggregators in the industry, hailing the partnership as a significant milestone:</p>
<p>"The collaboration will allow us to extend our footprint in regulated jurisdictions and help us expand our distribution to new markets and target new players."</p>
<p>Relax Gaming will make these features along with AvatarUX’s distinct portfolio of titles available to its network of partners and bring them more worthwhile experiences. Relax caters to tier-one operators from the industry, providing them with a vast selection of games, with more than 4,000 online casino games available as part of the company’s aggregation solution.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CPO Shelley Hannah was similarly excited about the partnership and said that this new tie-up allowed Relax Gaming to further expand its portfolio of products with the addition and esteemed suppliers such as AvatarUX, which has become a "leader in innovation."</p>
<p>"We are delighted to add them as our latest Silver Bullet partner and we know operators will be eager to showcase their portfolio of games," Hannah added. AvatarUX has been rapidly expanding its content offer through similar partnerships over the last couple of weeks and months.</p>
<p>The company has teamed up with REEVO, Light &amp; Wonder, and BlueOcean Gaming, among others. Relax Gaming has also been expanding its reach with various studios, with the company most recently adding Endorphina’s portfolio to its list of partners in the Powered By platform.</p>
<p>Apart from aggregating third-party content, Relax Gaming is preparing for the launch of its very own blockbuster game, Money Train 4, which will be arriving very soon.</p>
