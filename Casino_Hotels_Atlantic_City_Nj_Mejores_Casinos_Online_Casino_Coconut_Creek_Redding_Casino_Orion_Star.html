<p>While seeing hospital hallways and waiting rooms filled with gaming tables and slot machines isn’t likely to be seen anytime soon, Caesars Entertainment might be trying to lay the groundwork for something close to that. The casino operator and Purdue University in Indiana, through its College of Veterinary Medicine, have formalized a relationship they’ve had for the past couple of years. With a newly-signed partnership signed, the school’s horse hospital in Shelbyville will now be known as the Caesars Entertainment Equine Specialty Hospital.</p>
<p>Caesars Supports Its Communities</p>
<p>Caesars has been a benefactor of the hospital since 2019, having donated almost $1.5 million to the facility. The casino operator has a history of supporting its communities, so the idea of this being a segue for turning hospitals into casinos is very tenuous. Indiana has a strong horse racing history and Caesars is the owner of, among other properties in the state, the Indiana Grand Racing and Casino, just miles from the equine hospital, which first opened in 2017.</p>
<p>Dr. Ellen Lowery, director of the Purdue University Veterinary Hospital, said in a statement, “We are delighted that Caesars Entertainment will be part of the mission of our hospital. Everything we do there is state of the art and involves the most current diagnostics and therapeutics, so I’m excited to see the continued innovation we are able to provide for our patients and clientele. The newly-branded Caesars Entertainment Equine Specialty Hospital was initially constructed to help support Indiana’s growing horse racing industry. It is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment and provides medical services, diagnostics, therapy and more to performance horses. The center, according to senior equine surgeon Dr. Timm Gudehus, is capable of providing long-bone-fracture repairs, advanced diagnostic imaging, ultrasounds and even stem cell therapy. Soon to be added is a “large gantry helical CT scanning machine,” reportedly the first of its kind in the US.</p>
<p>Terms of the Partnership Unclear</p>
<p>An announcement about the partnership by Purdue University didn’t provide details of what the partnership involves, other than the renaming of the equine hospital. With such a significant contribution having been made by Caesars over the past couple of years, there may not be much more to it. With its commitment to community support and its long list of awards received for its efforts, the casino operator knows how to maximize its relationships so they’re mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>The GM of Harrah’s Hoosier Park Racing and Casino, Trent McIntosh, says of the partnership with Purdue, “Caesars Entertainment remains committed to supporting the communities in which we operate, including this premier hospital and the students of Purdue’s College of Veterinary Medicine. We are thrilled to share in all the benefits this facility brings to the growing horse racing community in Indiana.”</p>
