    <h1>Casino Minneapolis Royal Caribbean Casino Royale Login Casinos Online Reno Casino Hotels Casino Joe</h1>

<p>Hello everyone, I have been hanging out among the various online casino sites for more than 6 years, all aams mostly just for slots.</p>
<p>I think I have at least some experience.</p>
<p>I noticed that on my gaming account on 888 the only times they've made me win is only by unlocking the bonus and never with the balance deposited. I will tell you that last year I uploaded 400 euros several times (for example 60 then 50 then 70 etc....) in the span of a week. Playing everything at slot bet 60/80/1 never had a bonus/freespin in all these sessions and sometimes, I mean sometimes maybe 2 or 3 times a payout x20/30 the stake. In short, it was always a downward spin.</p>
<p>I complained and they limited my account.</p>
<p>I contacted assistance and they reopened my gaming account at the beginning of 2023</p>
<p>In one week I topped up 400 euros more and more times as I mentioned above and I only placed bets on 60/80/1 euro slot bets.</p>
<p>You will sayâ€¦ Well now the casino will have returned some RTP. The answer is no... Apart from the usual 2/3 paid at x20/30 the bet and got 2 bonus/freespin with one paid 100x and the other x120. Every slot kept pretending to give bonuses/freespins and I only got 2, one paid 0 the other 11 euros (x11) It was just a negative spin.... In short, you understood... 800 euros in a year of play paid return of not even 250 euros. I add that for each deposit they gave a bonus of 20% of the top-up... so imagine the turnaround I made, which are not just counting the 800 paid.</p>
<p>Doesn't that sound like a highly anomalous situation?!?</p>
<p>Because in all these years and in other casinos it has never happened. We know that you lose gambling... But I don't think so</p>
