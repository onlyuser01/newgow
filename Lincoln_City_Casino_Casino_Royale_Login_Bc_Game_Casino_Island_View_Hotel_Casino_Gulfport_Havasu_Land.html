    <h1>Lincoln City Casino Casino Royale Login Bc Game Casino Island View Hotel Casino Gulfport Havasu Land</h1>

<p>sure, the welcome bonus and likely their weekly promotions. the amount being withdrawn is valid according to their t&amp;c - the issue is that my bank does not HAVE what they are asking for. Every other casino I play on has accepted what i've sent, and i have sent dreamz much more. here's their most recent email to me (please note i'm still blocked) -</p>
<p>Dear Debra,</p>
<p>It appears that the quality of the following required documents were not up to standard:</p>
<p>Proof of deposit with card **1676</p>
<p>Picture from the bank statement showing the deposit with the card details. For security reasons, please cover the other card numbers, except the first 6 and last 4 digits. Kindly make sure that your full name, bank account number and bank's logo is visible from the document, as well as the deposit details. Please make sure that you include the URL in case you are submitting a screenshot of online banking.</p>
<p>We kindly ask you to go the 'Account' and 'Verification' section and upload a new copy. Please contact us directly through our Live Chat in case you need assistance.</p>
<p>**My bank does not provide this all on one screen which is why i sent multiple screenshots PLUS screenshots of my online bank profile. Apparently it's still not good enough.</p>
<p>a screenshot of the deposit will not show the card details, it will show my bank account number. it was a debit card i used. they don't seem to understand that.</p>
<p>i cannot provide what they are asking for because it does not exist, aside from the pics i've already sent them.</p>
<p>this is a ploy to get out of paying me.</p>
