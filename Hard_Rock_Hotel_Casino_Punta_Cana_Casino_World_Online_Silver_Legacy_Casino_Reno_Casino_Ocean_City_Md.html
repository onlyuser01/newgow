    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Casino World Online Silver Legacy Casino Reno Casino Ocean City Md</h1>

<p>Dear Team,</p>
<p>Here's what happened:</p>
<p>On September 12, I requested a payout of 5000€ via bank transfer, which was processed accordingly on September 13.</p>
<p>On September 18, my bank informed me that they would not accept the transfer from Olympusbet due to missing licenses in Germany, and that the money was being returned to Olympusbet.</p>
<p>I communicated this situation to Olympusbet. In response, they requested on September 19 that I provide a bank statement, proving that I had not received the money into my account.</p>
<p>I sent them my bank statement, the communication with the bank, and screenshots of the transaction to Olympusbet.</p>
<p>Since then, I have received no further response. I hope that the 5000€ will be credited back to my Olympusbet account so that I can select an alternative method of withdrawal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, live chat support has not been helpful. They simply state that the matter is being handled "with priority" by the relevant department.</p>
