<p>DraftKings and the PGA TOUR have officially expanded on their multi-year exclusive arrangement, an announcement by the daily fantasy and sports book provider outlined. The content and marketing deal signed in 2019 that made DraftKings the first Official Daily Fantasy Game of the PGA TOUR now expands into the sports betting sphere by designating the Boston-based sports book provider as the first Official Betting Operator of the PGA TOUR.</p>
<p>First PGA TOUR Official Betting Operator</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, DraftKings is joining the TOUR’s Official Betting Operator program, giving it rights to use trademarks and logos in the US, as well as to advertise within its media and partner platforms, including content and video rights for the sports book of the operator. DraftKings can now create pre- and post-game betting programming and distribute highlights to users who have wagered.</p>
<p>Ezra Kucharz, DraftKings’ Chief Business Officer, outlined both DraftKings and the PGA TOUR continued to make history by expanding on their agreement which started last year through making new exciting and innovative additions.</p>
<p>“We are excited to further our relationship with the PGA TOUR as their first Official Betting Operator as well. Golf has been an especially important outlet for fan engagement over these past few months, and this latest collaboration is a significant next step for both the golf and gaming industries.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>The PGA TOUR returned to action in June, with several of its events that have already taken place since then being among the most wagered on with DraftKings, placing golf as the fourth most popular sport with the betting operator. PGA TOUR’s Senior Vice President, Media and Gaming, Norb Gambuzza, expressed his content with the growing collaboration between the TOUR and DraftKings.</p>
<p>“The growth in consumption and fan engagement we have seen over the last year in our DraftKings Daily Fantasy games has been tremendous. The expansion of the relationship to now include sports betting is a natural evolution and one which fully supports and promotes the PGA TOUR’s objectives of reaching and engaging new segments of fans while introducing them to our players, tournaments and media platforms.” Norb Gambuzza, Senior Vice President, Media and Gaming, PGA TOUR</p>
<p>DraftKings and the PGA TOUR began their partnership in July 2019 through the re-launch of the PGA TOUR DraftKIngs Fantasy Golf, allowing the fantasy sports operator to differentiate in the fantasy space having the exclusive intellectual property over the program.</p>
<p>In March 2020, the TOUR partnered with The Action Network to launch the first-of-its-kind, golf-centred betting content platform, GolfBet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, DraftKings completed a three way merger to combine with its sports betting technology partner SBTech and list on the NASDAQ, signed multiple partnership deals with leagues and casino operators to secure market entries in different states, entered the online casino space by launching standalone casino app in Pennsylvania, and opened a retail sports book at the Mardi Gras Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado.</p>
