<p>PokerStars Partners with Women Who Code</p>
<p>PokerStars announced on Thursday that it joined forces with the global community for women in technology, Women Who Code (WWCode). By becoming the first gambling partner for Women Who Code, PokerStars plans to “improve female representation and diversity, and encourage women to grow their career within the industry.” Under the new collaboration, PokerStars will be a part of WWCode’s social media posts, blog posts, as well as newsletters and events.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, WWCode is a non-profit organization that supports women who are pursuing a career within technology companies. Besides meetings, scholarships, and training, the company organizes professional evaluations and assists women develop a variety of technical skills. WWCode is also focused on strategic impactful diversity programs that pave the way for women as leaders within “companies and the greater community.”</p>
<p>Since its foundation, the company has amassed more than 290,000 members from more than 130 countries around the world. Moreover, so far, WWCode has organized more than 14,000 free events around the world.</p>
<p>PokerStars Is Proud to Be WWCode’s First Gambling Partner</p>
<p>PokerStars revealed that one of its goals is to be representing diversity while at the same time fostering “an inclusive environment while celebrating, respecting, valuing and supporting differences.” In fact, the latest announcement does not come unexpected, considering the launch of the women-only online poker tournament by PokerStars. The tournament took place on March 27 this year, complementing Women’s History Month. Additionally, PokerStars remains committed to growing poker itself by engaging with new players including female poker players.</p>
<p>“We are proud to officially become the first gambling partner of Women Who Code and recognize the same values and desire to inspire women to excel in their technology careers.” Rebecca McAdam Willetts, Associate Director Group Public Relations at PokerStars</p>
<p>PokerStars’ associate director of group public relations, Rebecca McAdam Willetts, shared her excitement in a statement. Willetts outlined that PokerStars is proud to become the first gambling partner of WWCode. She added that the two organizations share the same values.</p>
<p>Additionally, Willetts acknowledged that both PokerStars and WWCode share a vision about a world where women are “proportionally represented as technical leaders, executives, founders, VCs, board members and software engineers.” In conclusion, she said that “at PokerStars, we are allies to all the amazing women in the industry.”</p>
