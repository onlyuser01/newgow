    <h1>Royal Casino Casinos In San Diego Brango Casino Review The Venue At Horseshoe Casino Casino Louisvil</h1>

<p>A brand new social gaming platform, PickGuru, announced agreements with Stats Perform and Sportradar to display its ambition to disrupt the social gaming space.</p>
<p>PickGuru Means Business</p>
<p>The deals with industry-leading providers of sports data and data-driven technology Stats Perform and Sportradar officially confirmed the intention of the relatively new social gaming platform PickGuru to differentiate its offering in the social gaming space.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have secured deals with Stats Perform and Sportradar, whose reputations in the field of sports data and technology are unrivalled. Our users will be the main beneficiaries as they’ll encounter the thrill of live sport, inside our app, as it unfolds in real time. This deal facilitates that crucial gameplay experience.” Olly Roland-Jones, CEO, PickGuru</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deals, global data feeds of both data providers will be seamlessly integrated into the portfolio of social games of the social gaming platform to allow PickGuru players to immerse fully in the gaming experience alongside live sport.</p>
<p>PickGuru’s offering focuses on a range of real-time games in which participants have to predict certain outcomes and can join nationwide leagues to win big money pots for relatively small stakes or compete with friends and families in mini-leagues.</p>
<p>The deals with the leading statistics provider in the UK Stats Perform and the global supplier of sports betting data to sportsbook operators Sportradar will further enhance PickGuru’s games and player engagement by instantaneously updating the leaderboards to allow participants to track their progress and rankings in real time.</p>
<p>Soccer and Golf Contests</p>
<p>As an official media data partner of the English Premier League (EPL), Sky Sports, BBC Sport, as well as a number of high-profile bookmakers with operations in the UK, Stats Perform will take charge of PickGuru’s soccer games. The social platform offers contests based on the EPL and UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>Supplier of sports technology service to over 450 betting companies worldwide Sportradar will ensure live data from golf tournaments to let PickGuru’s players be among the first to know the latest action via its lightning-fast updates. Sportradar and PickGuru signed a one-year deal.</p>
<p>The social gaming platform founded by the co-founder of Stats Perform Oliver Slipper is gaining traction ahead of its official launch in January 2022, having acquired its UK Gambling Commission license and appointed Olly Roland-Jones as its chief executive officer earlier this month.</p>
<p>In November, PickGuru raised £2.6 million ($3.5 million) in seed funding, attracting investor interest from some betting industry names like the former communications director of Paddy Power Simon Wear, the founder of Grabyo Will Neale, founders of Marshmallow Alexander and Oliver Kent-Braham and others.</p>
