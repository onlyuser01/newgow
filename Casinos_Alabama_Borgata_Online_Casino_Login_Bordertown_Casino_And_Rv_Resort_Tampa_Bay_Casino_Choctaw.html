<p>No,</p>
<p>They scamed me i think üôÅ</p>
<p>I will provide a more detailed view of facts .</p>
<p>First of all, I started using SkyCrown on 16th May 2023 and deposited USD 131.87.</p>
<p>I played only blackjack, and on the first day, I made a profit of USD 100. So, I decided to withdraw USD 150 (payment via my credit card), and it worked. I had the money in my account on 17th May 2023.</p>
<p>Then, on 17th May 2023, I added more money, USD 200, and I won many times in blackjack, resulting in a balance of CHF 755. When I tried to withdraw, they didn't accept my withdrawal.</p>
<p>I found it strange, so I contacted support, and that's when my nightmare began. They asked me for the same documents multiple times, even though I had already sent them the banking documents 15 times. We exchanged more than 100 emails in total.</p>
<p>They said that my cards and bank accounts were validated, so I should be able to request a withdrawal. However, when I requested the withdrawal of USD 755, it didn't work!</p>
<p>Once again, they are making fun of me and sending the same email asking the same question. They scammed me out of USD 15 from an ETH deposit that I never received in my account.</p>
<p>They asked me to create an EcoPayz account, and I did everything. The account was validated through their KYC process, but now EcoPayz is no longer available in my dashboard!</p>
<p>It has been two weeks, and they have held my money hostage!</p>
<p>I need my money back. Can you help me recover it, or should I file a complaint in Cura√ßao and Cyprus against these scammers hiding behind the company Libergos? By the way, their casino license is no longer valid, and there is already an investigation into them for fraud and scams.</p>
<p>Now I am sharing this situation here so that you know that SkyCrown is a scam and dishonest.</p>
<p>Can TR all e-mails if you need.</p>
<p>Please help me</p>
<p>Best Regards ,</p>
