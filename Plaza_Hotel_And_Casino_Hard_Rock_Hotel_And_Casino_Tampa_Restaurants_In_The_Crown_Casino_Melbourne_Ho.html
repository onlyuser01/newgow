<p>well now i have a new complaint but this time another casino:::Loyalcasino</p>
<p>In May i made a dep there and i lost witin a vieuw minutes 30 euros and some free spins i didnt get what the bonus said i had to waitthat wasnt to bad not like it should but ok so i made a complaint to the live chat that it unbelievable that it possible to loose that quick all the money and evn a very small part of the play trough was met so that was not in sight and i play because you love to play and tha cjangwe to win offcourse well i the last months or even years veru muchpleasure and fun isnt there any more nly the thrill aand a vieuw day went by and than i giot anemail from the girl i spook with at live chat...see what i put with this as a photo the email i got and that says that i can make use of that bonus again so today i was told that normaly its not likethat so with the bonus again i tought well maybethey are right and and was the quick loss just bad luck...i dont agree and think ist normal that you loose that fast(i play at the lowest depends on what is possible but normaly i dont have much money i play 0.1 cents the spins ore 0.20 and above taht can happen but than i need to win first in orderthat it has use otherwise it gone immidiatly so i play also to play and not to loose the money within minutes thats not what i want i even dont need to win but when i can play enough so that the feeling inside is ok than fine.... i was looking for the first bonus i got with the email but i have so many off them that i cant find it so easely i am searching m,ore than half an hour now but still this is what my account says (if its not removed by now true the loyalcasino)and it says clearly without a doubt that i have that bonus with the spins 50 now and than for six days 25 each day on the games that is shown so you also choose which game you play the free spins...i like twin spin and the spins are worth0.25 and for example starburst a spin is worth 0.10 so i play te twin spin off course but because i recieved the email with the telling tht i couls use that bonus again and it is in my account very clear and i could click onit and it was activated with my deposit.so i got the 200% deposit 10 and got 30 euros great..and i want to play the free spins first and they dont work so contact livechat and at the end i still dont have the free spins because they refuse to give me the spins...they say ive played them a week ago...and thats true i admit but thats not what this is about because i lost the money so quick last time they gave me the bonus agin to try ...and when i wouldnt got i would for sure made no dep i would even not visit the casino....and the bonus was for the reason that i made the dep...sso when you dont get it aand you know what has happened i think you understand that the bonmus was the tricker to dep and agin i wouldnt made it if the bonus wasnt there and see for yourself the pic says it all i had no reason to think that i wouldnt get the spins and its so horrible tonot get them especially after the experience the last time that i want what i ayed for and is promised now they act like its my foult and doing and i am punished for there failure may be it was supposed that i got it but what can i do about it when its in your account and you activate it with dep...its not my foult its tere s and so they have to pay not me and i incist of getting those spins just for the bad experienc ethe time before and this makes me never come ack after the bonus is played but i want them and ive payed for them so there mine *( when i say something that isnt correct id love to hear but i think that i am in my right and they are reponsable and niot me AND I HOPE THAT I WILL GET THEM AND THEY ARE JHELD RESPONSIBLE FIOR THE FAILURES THEY MAKE AT there casino than you dont start a casino..and if it was mine than i had given double the spins but i want my players to be sattisfied and when you know how much emails and live chats i had over this its absurd i dont even have the words sorry but this is just uneccaptable and i refuse to do nothing and let the spins for what they ....ive seen now after two deps that i will never win at this casino so therefor i dont need to do it but for the way they have treated me i semand them... and when they where nice to me and treatyed me like a player and a paying costumer than i wouldnt even concider to play them but now i will...and i jhope that you think the same way....or at least know what i mean and feel the frustration and powerless feeling because you cant do anything than get help but it sucks ..so i hope that i can play them very soon !!!</p>
