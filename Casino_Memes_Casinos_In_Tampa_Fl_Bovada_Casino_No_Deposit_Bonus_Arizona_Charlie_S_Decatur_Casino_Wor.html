    <h1>Casino Memes Casinos In Tampa Fl Bovada Casino No Deposit Bonus Arizona Charlie S Decatur Casino Wor</h1>

<p>you ask me if i have proof games are rigged .i have many screenshot showing the last 10 minutes in a game when they block you from any win and bring your balance to zero.</p>
<p>why dont we switch the question .let the casino proof that the games are fair .they cant .as you read in their terms they always state that the casino is not responsible for third party content .does this not proof that casinos do not trust the games at all but offering them to players and claim fair games .if i claim something i must stand behind that and not run away when it is failing .am i right ?if there is a problem with game and you complain you clearly see both partys giving the player the go around hoping he will forget it .all online games are scam .the provider needs 30% the casino 30% ,30% taxes and cost what is left 10% for the player .why ?you clearly see sometimes the 10% win in the games .i deposited many times 100€ and i get 10€ profit and fom that moment i cant win anything anymore .in meantime they let you win from your loses but they make sure you not pass the 10€ prifit just to smooth out the rtp and bring it to 97% as claimed .you lost 100€ but the rtp was 97% .scam .deception .only evil heartless people can cope with that .</p>
