<p>Edict Egaming lauded Betsson as one of the best operators in Europe and said that it is happy to have gained an influential ally</p>
<p>Edict Egaming, a Gauselmann Group subsidiary, has unveiled a new partnership with the online casino operator Betsson Group. Under the agreement, the former company will supply the iGaming operator with a selection of Merkur slot games.</p>
<p>By leveraging its aggregation system, Edict Egaming will launch a wide range of Merkur games, powering Betsson’s brands with iGaming content. The casino group operates a variety of European brands, including Betsafe, Betsson and NordicBet.</p>
<p>The casino operator hopes to launch a myriad of Merkur slots through its brands, providing customers in various jurisdictions with premium iGaming content. The group, which also offers online sports betting and poker, is always seeking to expand its portfolio and introduce more engaging titles to its users.</p>
<p>Edict Egaming Is Happy to Have Gained an Influential Partner</p>
<p>Representatives from the two companies commented on the agreement, with Dominic-Daniel Liénard, chief executive of Edict Egaming, lauding Betsson as one of the most influential gambling operators in Europe.</p>
<p>Liénard attributed Betsson’s success to its large number of varied brands that are designed to appeal to fans in various countries. Speaking of the deal, the CEO noted that the current deal will provide his team with a new internationally-recognized ally.</p>
<p>Liénard added that he is happy with the opportunity to aggregate Merkur games, supplying Betsson with more content. He concluded that Betsson fans are sure to love the new slot games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Laura Peretta, Betsson Group head of supplier relations, said that her team has always prioritized a highly diversified portfolio of games. She noted that the new deal with Edict Egaming will arm Betsson and its subsidiaries with a selection of highly popular Merkur games.</p>
<p>Peretta concluded that the addition of Merkur games to Betsson’s portfolio will make the operator’s brands even more attractive. She said that the Betsson team is happy to join forces with a “reputable and reliable” partner such as Edict Egaming.</p>
<p>Betsson Expanded Its Offering with More Content</p>
<p>Prior to teaming with the Gauselmann-owned supplier, Betsson tapped into Spinomenal, adding high-quality content from the company to its portfolio. Earlier, the operator secured content from Relax Gaming in Greece, cementing its presence as a local leader.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Betsson posted its Q1 results, demonstrating a 30% revenue increase. The interim report showed metrics increasing across the board and marked a favorable start to the year for the company.</p>
