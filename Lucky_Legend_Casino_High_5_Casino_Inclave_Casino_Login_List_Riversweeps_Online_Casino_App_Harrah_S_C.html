<p>Green Bay Packers Look to Close Out Week 15 Strong Against LA Rams</p>

<p>Week 15 of the NFL will close with the game between the Green Bay Packers and the Los Angeles Rams. They’ll face off in what is almost a trivial Monday Night Football battle at Lambeau Field.</p>

<p>For this game, the Packers arrive motivated after a victory last week when they beat the Chicago Bears, 28-19. That allowed them to break a losing streak of two consecutive games and show that there’s still some level of talent on the squad.</p>
<p>The Rams also got back to winning the week before, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 17-16. That came off a stellar performance by a new QB who had almost no knowledge of the playbook. More of that will come today, when Baker Mayfield starts for his new team.</p>
<p>Not a Good Year for Rams or Packers</p>
<p>Both teams are having a losing season, with the Packers’ 5-8 record putting them in third place in the NFC North. The Rams aren’t showing the same skills that led them to a Super Bowl win last year, and are now in third in the NFC West at 4-9.</p>

<p>It happened a little too late, but Mayfield joined the Rams and immediately got to work. In the agonizing home win against the Raiders, the 27-year-old replaced John Wofford after the first offensive series, which was a failure. Mayfield completed 62.86% of his passes and was good for 22 of 35 attempts, covering 230 yards.</p>
<p>Rams head coach Sean McVay confirmed that Mayfield will be the starter for Monday night’s game. He explained that Wofford won’t be available because of a neck injury, but the truth is that Mayfield earned his shot at a start.</p>
<p>The Carolina Panthers castoff will now have to prove that his performance wasn’t a fluke. If he can stop the Packers, Mayfield will accomplish two things – he will show that he hasn’t lost his mojo, and he will make it almost impossible for the Packers to see the postseason.</p>
<p>The Packers are essentially ready to begin a rebuild. They’ve been slipping and sliding all season, but the defense isn’t going to go out without one last attempt at glory.</p>
<p>Cornerback Jaire Alexander expects his Packers to pick up seven interceptions tonight. It’s unfortunate he couldn’t go into each game since Week 1 with that level of energy.</p>
<p>Packers Heavy Favorites</p>
<p>Green Bay gets the benefit in this game for a number of reasons, but mostly because the Rams are hurting – physically and mentally. The offense is battered and missing starters, and even when it was healthy, it wasn’t able to make a big impact.</p>
<p>Now, the Rams’ defense is dealing with its own issues. This further exacerbates the situation and leaves the Packers way out in front.</p>
<p>However, the Packers have been dealing with some issues of their own. These will come into play tonight and should impact the total score if not the outcome.</p>
<p>The Packers have won their last two games against the Rams and have gone 5-1 over the past matchups. They’re on track to add another win on Monday. Despite this, most bettors until now expect the Rams to cover the seven-point spread.</p>
<p>The weather at Lambeau isn’t inviting for a team from LA. Subzero temperatures are child’s play for the Packers, and they’ll use the cold to their advantage.</p>
