<p>32-year-old professional striker Leigh Griffiths has been questioned by the authorities in relation to an open investigation regarding a series of alleged incidents tied to gambling in sports.</p>
<p>Griffiths, who played for Celtic FC between 2014 and 2022 and represented Scotland’s national soccer team in over 20 official matches, was taken to the London Road police station in Glasgow together with two other men.</p>
<p>Griffiths Has Denied Any Implication</p>
<p>On December 1, the player who helped Celtic scoop up seven league titles and three prestigious Scottish Cups and scored 123 goals in its 261 appearances for the same team received an early morning visit from the police at his home in Bothwell, South Lanarkshire. He was taken to the London Road police station where he denied breaching any rules.</p>
<p>Griffiths is one of the three men who received the same police visit as part of a pre-planned operation targeting alleged incidents tied to betting on sports. According to a spokesman for the Scotland police, the other two men were ages 37 and 35, respectively, and they were arrested in Bonnyrigg in Midlothian and Airdrie in North Lanarkshire. The police announced that all three men were released and no charges were brought against them. They are now all pending “further inquiries.”</p>
<p>According to the English Football Association, betting on soccer is forbidden to all players, coaches, managers, staff members of all clubs, licensed agents, and directors part of the Premier League. The association has created a series of rules meant to protect the integrity as well as the reputation of the game while guaranteeing decision-making processes are entirely based entirely on merit and are not meant to attract any personal financial gains.</p>
<p>Professional soccer players are not allowed to place any bet on any soccer event, anywhere. This rule refers to all soccer matches and competitions, no matter where they might be played on the planet. Players are also forbidden from wagering on any global soccer market at any level. This includes any aspect that is not tied to the gameplay itself, such as betting on who will next manage a certain club. Players who breach any of these strict rules are in danger of losing their careers and facing possible criminal charges. In November, the English Football Association charged Brentford striker Ivan Toney over more than 230 alleged breaches of these betting rules between February 2017 and January 2021.</p>
