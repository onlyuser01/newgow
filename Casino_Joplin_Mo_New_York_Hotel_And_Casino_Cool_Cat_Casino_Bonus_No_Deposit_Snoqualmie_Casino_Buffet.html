    <h1>Casino Joplin Mo New York Hotel And Casino Cool Cat Casino Bonus No Deposit Snoqualmie Casino Buffet</h1>

<p>sorry, but I don't understand at all what's been going on at Casino Guru lately. for me this was always the first address when it came to informing myself about a casino and your review could actually be trusted blindly.</p>
<p>the times seem to be over. casinos get a bad reputation if they have a win limit per spin of 100,000 euros, but casinos like Palmslot, which require a 10x (!)wagering of the deposit even without a bonus - unbelievable. there is not even a note in the casino Guru review about it. (i had a look at the T&amp;Cs thanks to the player reviews here and didn`t deposit.)</p>
<p>the bonus conditions are also hair-raising. a max cash-out of 10x bonus amount is really not fair if there is a required turnover of 40x deposit AND bonus. plus a fee of 8%(!) if a payout is requested again within a month (!).</p>
<p>so if you take all these together, how can it be that this casino gets a "very good" reputation? and on top the players are told that this would not be unfair and ok, because it is in the T&amp;Cs? and 10x times turnover is because of anti-laundring-rules? are you kidding? this has clearly nothing to do with anti-laundring reasons but with unfair conditions with anti-laundring-rules as a pretext.</p>
<p>that being said, could be that a winspin-limit of 100,000 is a (highroller)problem, but this here is about the small people and about breaking their necks.</p>
<p>all in all, the whole story is more than disappointing and so slowly but surely the "very good" reputation of Casino Guru goes down the drain, because this is not the first absolutely incomprehensible review and not the first time absolute unfair conditions are excused.</p>
