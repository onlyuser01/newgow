<p>Kindred Group continues to grow its operations in the United States by adding the Mohegan Sun Pocono in Pennsylvania. PA is one of the latest states to legalize its sports betting industries, with Kindred continuing with its US push.</p>
<p>Kindred Continues to Expand in the US and Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Kindred Group has signed a multi-year partnership with tribal casino operator Mohegan Sun Pocono in Pennsylvania, the United States.</p>
<p>Thanks to the five-year deal, Kindred will work with increase its footprint in the country, bringing its proprietor land-based and online software solutions to licensed operators state-wise.</p>
<p>The offer won’t cover poker solutions, however, as the Mohegan Sun reconsidered a previous application to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB), deciding to withdraw its request instead.</p>
<p>The Mohegan Sun Pocono is located just outside Plains, Pennsylvania and it’s owned by Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment. Mohegan Sun Pocono will work with established gaming company Unibet, owned by Kindred, which will operate from Mohegan’s property.</p>
<p>Kindred Group Is a Renowned Operator</p>
<p>Kindred Group is one of the largest operators in the world. Established in Europe and Australia, the company has over 24 million customers across 11 brands. As a founding member of the defining safety &amp; security agencies in the industry, including the European Gaming and Betting Association and ESSA, the group is held in high esteem.</p>
<p>Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment VP of Interactive Gaming Aviram Alroy commented on the deal, as part of the official press release:</p>
<p>We’ve aligned with one of the best online casino and sport book operators in online regulated markets which will allow us to offer best in class experience to our existing customers as well as attracting new ones.</p>
<p>Mr. Alroy explained that bringing Kindred Group on board has been a significant success for the company and the state. Kindred Group’s expansion plans have been determined.</p>
<p>A US Expansion in Full Blast</p>
<p>Last year, Kindred CEO Henrik Tjärnström announced that the company would seek to add more assets in the United States, diversifying its portfolio further through its flagship brand Unibet and by partnering with tech companies. As a result, today Kindred is partnered with several established companies in the sector, including:</p>
<p>Hard Rock Atlantic City</p>
<p>Scientific Gaming Digital (SGD)</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming</p>
<p>Kindred US SVP Manuel Stan has expressed his confidence that the latest partnership between his company and Mohegan Sun Pocono was a step in the right direction, with customers being the ultimate beneficiaries of the deal:</p>
<p>We are excited and proud to extend our US footprint into one of the largest US states to regulate both online sports betting and casino. Finding a strong partner who shares Kindred’s dedication to customer experience and values has been critical, and I am delighted that we have found just that in Mohegan Sun Pocono.</p>
<p>Kindred Group first entered New Jersey where it’s powering some of the state’s largest sportsbooks, including DraftKings and SugarHouse. Pennsylvania is the second state the company has expanded into.</p>
<p>Kindred supplies four out of the six sportsbooks in Pennsylvania, including Rivers Casino, SugarHouse Casino, Parx Casino, and South Philadelphia Turf Club.</p>
<p>Upon successful conclusion of the five-year test period, Kambi and Mohegan can expand the deal automatically for another two years.</p>
