    <h1>Ignition Casino Login Pioneer Casino Laughlin Viejas Casino And Resort Casino Names Best Real Money</h1>

<p>Novibet has given its iGaming operations in Greece a significant boost with the delivery of bespoke content by HungryBear Gaming, a company with a solid track record in building innovative and out-of-the-box games for the online casino sector. This comes at a time when the studio is actively looking to expand its distribution capabilities through new strategic alliances.</p>
<p>The studio, which has development teams in both Canada and the United Kingdom, is bringing its original free-to-play Slot Masters multiplayer product to Novibet, which will allow local players in Greece to enjoy some of the most successful games in the history of iGaming.</p>
<p>Slot Masters garnered 38,000 players on its first day of release alone, and it has been one of the hottest online casino options since July when it was released. Now, the company is delivering this same experience to Novibet’s audiences. The partnership will not stop at Greece, however, as the two companies are also hoping to push into other markets together including Brazil, a press release stated.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, HungryBear CCO Heather Faulker welcomed the opportunity to introduce the Slot Masters product and content in Greece and with Novibet at this. Faulkner hailed Novibet’s commitment to bringing the best possible experience to its players which is something that aligned perfectly with the supplier’s own ambitions and business focus.</p>
<p>Novibet Casino Product &amp; CRM Director Fotini Matthaiou was similarly happy with the release, hailing the significance of Slot Masters and its value to the operator’s business in Greece. Matthaiou was happy to see yet another unique and original product be made available to the company, allowing it to significantly diversify its product offering.</p>
<p>Already, the two companies have reported success in the market, with the initial launch period hailed as a success. Slot Masters is a brand new and innovative title that allows players to affect each other’s score by utilizing various attack and defense tools, creating a competitive gaming environment that boosts engagement and player acquisition.</p>
<p>HungryBear has been actively looking to establish its Slot Masters product, with a recent deal seeing the supplier team up with another developer, Blueprint Gaming. Thanks to this tie-up, HungryBear is able to access more IPs and franchises and incorporate them into the Slot Masters format.</p>
<p>Greece has proven an interesting market for suppliers from all over Europe, with several high-profile content deals taking place in the jurisdiction over the past months.</p>
