    <h1>Plaza Casino Casino In Lake Charles Prairieband Casino Harrahs Casino Biloxi Dreams Casino QTech Gam</h1>

<p>CT Interactive, a leading provider of content for the online casino sector, and QTech Games, a powerful distribution platform and aggregator of content, have forged a new alliance</p>
<p>The two companies have negotiated a fresh collaboration during this year’s ICE London and are finally announcing it officially. This tie-up will specifically focus on several markets, including Asia, Africa, Europe, and not least, Latin America.</p>
<p>New Opportunities Await in Emerging Markets</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunity, CT Interactive EMEA head of business development, Milena Tsankarska, welcome the deal and said that it would allow the company to significantly expand its presence in Asian markets, strike business deals with new clients, and generally make its product and brand known. She stated:</p>
<p>We are very proud that we were able to sign such an important deal with one of the leading game distributors worldwide during the leading gaming exhibition ICE 2023. CT Interactive’s Milena Tsankarska</p>
<p>This partnership represents a significant milestone for the company and another step in the company’s expansion objectives. QTech Games should help bring brand recognition and stronger revenues for CT Interactive, Tsankarska concluded.</p>
<p>QTech Games CCO Daniel Long was similarly pleased with the development. He said that it was an honor to have CT Interactive as a part of the company’s list of partners – a partnership that would no doubt prove beneficial.</p>
<p>CT Interactive has been a lot in the news recently. The Bulgaria-headquartered studio and supplier of iGaming content has been steadily expanding its global reach in numerous markets across Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>CT Interactive revealed that it had teamed up with 7bet.it in Lithuania just this week and announced a similar deal with PepperMill Casino last week.</p>
