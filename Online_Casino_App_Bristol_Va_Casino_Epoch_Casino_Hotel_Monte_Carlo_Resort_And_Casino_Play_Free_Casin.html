    <h1>Online Casino App Bristol Va Casino Epoch Casino Hotel Monte Carlo Resort And Casino Play Free Casin</h1>

<p>I’m not really sure of the exact balance. I’ve asked for my bet history but still have not received it. The bonus was applied by the casino while I was playing, on top of a bonus free deposit. The answer is yes, I had no idea the bonus had been added, it was such a small a small amount that I didn’t notice that it had even been applied. However when I went to cash out I noticed it.</p>
<p>I had told them that I simply want my account restored to the exact balance prior to the bonus being added, im not looking for any winnings after the cash back was added.</p>
<p>I believe my balance was around $100 at the time the weekend cash back bonus was added to my current balance. I’m guessing because I was 8% through the bonus when I went to cash out. It was at that point that I was told I could cancel the bonus myself but it would relinquish my balance. At that point I nearly blew a gasket.</p>
<p>here’s the part that really bothers me, I deposit 1000’s monthly, I didn’t expect this to be so difficult, the crazy piece is that casinos don’t want funds mixed, they don’t want clients to add a bonus on top of a bonus free deposit, so I’m blown away that they would mix funds. In any case it’s exactly what they did.</p>
<p>in fact what’s even crazier is the fact that they’ve done this before. Once they even added the weekend Cashback on top of a free spin bonus they had given me.</p>
<p>the other was the exact same issue I’m dealing with now. Both resulted in apology’s from the casino. The second time I had requested that absolutely not happen again, to which I received assurances that it would not.</p>
<p>The issue involving the free spins was around March 8th 2022 and the issue where they added it to a deposit free balance was roughly March 17th 2022.</p>
<p>I had gotten to a supervisor who simply removed the Cashback from the balance and I was good to go. Exactly what I was asking for here, however, I was told it could be cancelled but I would lose my balance.</p>
<p>the deposit was roughly $30, if for some reason my balance was $30 at the time they added the Cashback bonus, then it’s acceptable to me that they restore $30 versus $100, I just believe my balance was around $100, simply because it was roughly $200 when I tried to cash out and it said I was 8% through.</p>
<p>I have some emails from the March 17th issue that ended in a pleasant acceptable resolution. That resulted in me cashing out.</p>
<p>I had told them I don’t ever want a bonus added to my playable under any circumstances. It makes zero sense when I have a withdrawable that suddenly requires playthrough, if I wanted a bonus like that I would have chosen to have it added at the time of the deposit.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite casinos, I simply want a fair resolution. I want to continue to be an ambassador for the casino, I’m just tired of getting the run around, it’s been a week now. I didn’t want to have to get anyone involved, I fully expected a pleasant resolution handled by the casino staff.</p>
<p>unfortunately I’m continuing to be told they will look into it, I’m told that my bet history has been sent even though it hasn’t been.</p>
<p>if they restore my balance I will be more than happy to remove the complaint, I’m simply asking for some assistance to reach a fair resolution.</p>
<p>let me know if you need anything.</p>
