<p>Comtrade Gaming, a leading technology supplier in the iGaming space, has revealed that it will be extending its working relationship with Superbet through mid-2024. The companies have been able to leverage their respective industry expertise to create a middle ground where those meet to bolster their offerings.</p>
<p>Superbet has its proprietary sportsbook to offer, whereas Comtrade brings its iCore platform to the market, an iGaming solution that is now available in the former’s Romanian and Polish markets.</p>
<p>Superbet managing director for online Adam Show has welcomed the opportunity to be able to continue and work with Comtrade Gaming, which has provided the exact content consumers expect. All of this comes while leveraging solutions that guarantee the brand long-term growth and sustainability, Show adds:</p>
<p>“We have big ambitions for future growth, and we don’t shy away from building our own technology and products, but most importantly, we want to give the best for our customers.” Superbet managing director for online Adam Show</p>
<p>Bringing Tailored Products to iGaming Operators</p>
<p>Comtrade Gaming has been able to create a tailored iGaming product through iCore that resonates with player bases. The company has repeatedly delivered highly customizable solutions that fit the industry needs and meet specific demands from operators, Superbet included.</p>
<p>Comtrade Gaming CCO Steven Valentine has spoken favorably of the opportunity to be extending this partnership and said that the company was happy to continue forging ahead with its Superbet alliance. Comtrade is not limited to Europe, as the company broke ground in the United States in September this year.</p>
<p>The company announced a key partnership with G Esports, extending iCore to G3’s upcoming betting products. Meanwhile, Superbet has been working on its European footprint. The company acquired the complete shares of Napoleon Sports and Casino in July.</p>
