<p>Micro betting is becoming increasingly popular, not only because Betr, a new startup backed by Jake Paul, but also because of changing consumer preferences. That is the conclusion that Simplebet, a micro-betting market platform has drawn from its work with prominent clients such as Betway, bet365, DraftKings, and many others.</p>
<p>Micro Betting Markets to Reap Big Benefits During NCAAB Season</p>
<p>Simplebet will make micro-betting lines available for more than 2,500 NCAAB games this season, with consumers able to bet on each successful scoring outcome and experience betting in a brand-new way. The news comes as more than 30 states have regulated sports gambling in the United States, and micro-betting is a legitimate product that players and consumers can engage with.</p>
<p>Simplebet is confident in the success of this new form of betting and the NCAAB season is a perfect opportunity for the company to test this. Simplebet’s product is based on machine learning algorithms that help provide quick fixtures to consumers who are waiting to make split-second decisions. Presently, DraftKings is the biggest operator in the United States to offer Simplebet’s micro-betting format and markets, with 19 states covered by the prominent sportsbook.</p>
<p>Bet365’s offer is limited to Colorado and New Jersey presently, with a launch in Ohio scheduled for January 1, 2023. Betway in the meantime is present in seven markets, among which are New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and others. Even though micro-betting markets are usually capped at $50 at the most, there is growing interest in this form of betting mostly because sports fans feel more involved in the moment.</p>
<p>There is no need to wait for an entire game to wrap up to find out the results, and micro-betting is more or less a continuation of the in-play betting experience. Simplebet products reported $262 million in bets during Major League Baseball for 2022. Interestingly, the MLB postseason led to an overall increase in micro-betting markets.</p>
