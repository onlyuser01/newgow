<p>The leading iGaming industry provider and NeoGames subsidiary, Pariplay, strengthened its senior-level team by announcing a new strategic appointment. The company revealed Monday it hired the services of the expert in account management and the gambling vertical, Irina Roman. Joining Pariplay, she was appointed to the role of Head of Account Management.</p>
<p>The latest appointment comes at a time when the company has seen significant growth across the globe. Moreover, by hiring an industry expert such as Roman, Pariplay plans to keep the positive momentum and continue growing within strategic markets such as North America and Europe. Strengthening its position in the aforementioned markets comes after the company signed multiple partnerships with leading operators.</p>
<p>Roman shared her excitement in a statement released on June 26, 2023. "I've been watching Pariplay go from success to success over time, so to join the team and help them grow even bigger is an exciting opportunity," she said. Pariplay's new Head of Account Management added: "I'm looking forward to strengthening relationships with existing clients, fostering relationships with new ones, and helping to grow Pariplay even further."</p>
<p>Before joining the company, Roman was a part of TrueLayer where she served as Senior Customer Success Manager. Still, her professional background includes more than a decade of experience within the gambling industry together with account management. Roman was a part of globally-recognized gaming and entertainment companies such as NetEnt, Enteractive and EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>Enrico Bradamante, Pariplay's Chief Commercial Officer, was excited about Roman's appointment. "We're delighted to welcome Irina to the Pariplay team, especially as we continue to expand in regulated markets and execute our growth strategy," he said.</p>
<p>Bradamante pointed out that Roman brings unique knowledge, experience and insight to the company. Finally, Pariplay's Chief Commercial Officer said: "We have every faith that she will directly contribute to bolstering our brand and elevating us to new heights!"</p>
<p>The recent appointment comes on the heels of another important hire announced by the company. Earlier this month, Pariplay confirmed it hired Ashley Bloor for the role of Director of Partnerships. By bringing in the seasoned gambling industry expert, the company strengthened its senior leadership team.</p>
<p>Currently, Pariplay has a presence in more than 20 regulated gambling markets around the globe. The company has a growing portfolio of partners that now surpasses 1,000 operators. Thanks to its Fusion platform, Pariplay offers a portfolio of content that includes more than 120 iGaming suppliers. Given its strong position within the online gambling vertical, Pariplay constantly grows its presence by engaging with new partners.</p>
