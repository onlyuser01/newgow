    <h1>Peppermill Resort Spa Casino South Virginia Street Reno Nv Foxwoods Resort Casino Location Riverboat</h1>

<p>The theme of this year’s ICE London event is Stronger Together, which could not be more apt when referring to the ongoing challenge we face in raising awareness of safer gambling and reducing gambling harms.</p>
<p>Gordon Moody is a charity founded over 50 years ago by the Reverend Gordon Moody himself. Mr Moody had already introduced Gamblers Anonymous to the UK in the 1960s, after noticing the gambling activities of some had led to difficulties in their lives. These weekly groups were a great support to many who were either suffering with gambling issues themselves or affected by the gambling of a loved one. It became apparent to Mr Moody that despite the groups being effective for the majority of those that used them, there was a contingent of people whose circumstances had become so desperate as a result of gambling, that something more than a weekly group would be needed, and so Gordon House, as it was first known, opened in South London in 1971.</p>
<p>Originally set up as a hostel for men made homeless because of gambling addiction, Gordon Moody today helps hundreds of people each year to reclaim and rebuild their lives free from gambling addiction, through specialist residential and retreat programmes. As part of the National Gambling Treatment Service (NGTS), Gordon Moody provides treatment programmes for those severely affected by gambling addiction. The 14-week residential programme for men provides intensive support in a safe space where access and exposure to gambling is removed, allowing the client to immerse themselves in their treatment and benefit from the support of their peers.</p>
<p>Over the years, additional programmes have been added, such as recovery housing for those not yet ready for fully independent living post treatment, the hybrid Retreat &amp; Counselling programme which combines short-stay retreats and online therapy for those who cannot access the residential programme, treatment for those with complex needs and multiple Let’s tackle gambling addiction together. For more information and for support with gambling addiction gordonmoody.org.uk addictions – in collaboration with addictions treatment provider Adferiad – and in 2021 we launched a pilot bespoke residential programme for women. Such has been the success of this pilot; the service is now a permanent part of our treatment offer.</p>
<p>Gordon Moody has helped thousands of people recover from gambling addiction and has provided hope for many when they saw no way out. It is not an exaggeration to say that for many, the treatment at Gordon Moody has been lifesaving. From the first phone call through to post[1]treatment support, our dedicated team are with you every step of the way. Our vision is to help those most affected by gambling addiction to access the right treatment, in the right place, at the right time – but we cannot do it alone.</p>
<p>At Gordon Moody we have seen an increase in people accessing treatment this year. Events such as the award winning Consumer Protection Zone at ICE are vital in bringing the sector together to raise awareness in safer gambling and reduce stigma in seeking help</p>
