<p>Livespins, an innovative slots streaming platform, has enhanced its product offering with the addition of content from SlotMatrix, EveryMatrix’s aggregation division. As agreed, Livespins will be able to create socially-charged iGaming experiences featuring SlotMatrix titles.</p>
<p>The current deal follows an earlier agreement between Livespins and Everymatrix whereby the latter company agreed to distribute the former company’s content to its operator partners.</p>
<p>As a result, Livespins’ content creators will be able to leverage recent titles such as Aladdin’s Rollover Respins and Fairy Fantasy Exotic Wilds, as well as established hits like Wild Willy’s Gold Rush and Hot Hot Honey. The branded hit The Lioness featuring the MMA athlete Amanda Nunes will also be available on Livespins.</p>
<p>The agreement allows Livespins to greatly expand its library. SlotMatrix, on the other hand, will get to tap into an entirely new demographic of players, many of which may not have played or seen its games before.</p>
<p>Livespins is breaking ground in the social casino space thanks to its innovative concept that allows players to bet behind their favorite streamer, brand ambassador or celebrity. The social element is further reinforced by chat functionalities packed with emojis and other engagement tools.</p>
<p>The product is constantly being enhanced thanks to new content agreements with industry-leading suppliers. Some of the latest agreements saw Livespins partner with companies such as 4ThePlayer, REEVO and Wazdan.</p>
<p>The Deals with Big-Name Providers “Keep on Coming”</p>
<p>SlotMatrix’s chief executive officer of games, Razvan Haiduc, said that the deal with Livespins will allow his team to engage with new audiences in an authentic way. He praised Livespins for its innovative concept that is revolutionizing the online casino space.</p>
<p>This is ground-breaking when it comes to how slots are delivered to and experienced by players, and we are delighted to have joined Livespins for what will be an exhilarating ride. Razvan Haiduc, CEO of Games, SlotMatrix</p>
<p>Michael Pedersen, Livespins’ chief commercial officer, also shared his thoughts on the agreement. He highlighted the importance of agreements with big-name suppliers to his company and said that his team is looking forward to onboarding SlotMatrix content.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix is looking to leverage our audience of highly engaged players, many of which fall into the Millennial and Generation Z demographics, and drive awareness of its titles in a new way. Michael Pedersen, CCO, Livespins</p>
<p>In other news, SOFTSWISS recently recognized the potential of Livespins and integrated the innovative product into its portfolio. Earlier this year, Livespins secured the Innovation in Slot Provision award at the EGR B2B Awards.</p>
