<p>Altenar, a company that specializes in the delivery of sportsbook platforms and software, has established a new partnership focused on technological innovation in the iGaming sector. In this particular case, Altenar is teaming up with Flows, a platform that provides no-code integration &amp; automation platform and solutions.</p>
<p>The alliance will benefit Altenar by significantly scaling up the pace of development and allowing Altenar to intuitively build new features and applications without ever having to bother about the code itself. Flows has made it so that companies can use the front end to develop powerful solutions that have a robust technical backend that make them work without any hitches.</p>
<p>Flows has been an expert in boosting business development by making new products, features, and integrations, much simpler to figure out and put into practice. This no-code approach was met with early-day scepticism that has been completely dashed now on account of Flows' successful track record with its solutions.</p>
<p>Altenar stands to significantly streamline its processes and ensure that it achieves better cost synergies and savings by leveraging Flows’ product and platform. Flows Director of Sales Domenico Mazzola has welcomed the opportunity to see this partnership with Altenar shape up.</p>
<p>"It’s an honour and a true testament to what we are building here at Flows to see an industry leader recognize the importance and the benefits that Flows, no-code automation, can bring to the industry," Mazzola added.</p>
<p>The partnership opportunity was also welcome by Altenar Commercial Director Charlie Williams who said that he was pleased to launch this new opportunity with Flows and work with the company in providing advanced integration and real-time automation as part of Altenar’s inner workings and development processes.</p>
<p>Williams spoke of how important it is to make sure that Altenar is able to send the right sports bets to the right players and guarantee client success. All in all, Flows will allow Altenar to significantly scale its sportsbook solutions and deliver on even greater value for its partners.</p>
<p>Flows has been actively present in the iGaming and gambling industry in general. The company teamed up with NuxGame and Nazionale Elettronica in the past months.</p>
