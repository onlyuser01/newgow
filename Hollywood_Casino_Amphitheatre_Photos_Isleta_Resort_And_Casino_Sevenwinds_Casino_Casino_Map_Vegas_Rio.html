<p>The leading online gaming technology company that provides services, solutions and products for iGaming operators around the globe, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced it entered the regulated online gambling market in Switzerland. The announcement came Tuesday and marks the debut of GiG for the Swiss market.</p>
<p>The company revealed that the entry was facilitated via a partnership agreement with a popular land-based and online gambling operator in the country. GiG did not disclose the name of the operator.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the latest collaboration, the company agreed to deliver its award-winning player account management (PAM) platform. According to GiG, the latest deal follows a Heads of Terms agreement that dates back to early January.</p>
<p>In a statement released by GiG on January 31, 2023, the company's CEO, Richard Brown, shared his excitement saying: "Given the expanding scope of opportunity for operators in the region, we're delighted to be entering the Swiss market in partnership with an established land-based brand." Finally, the CEO pointed out: "Our considerable experience at delivering robust and innovative solutions to retail organizations in highly complex regulated business, continues to help our reputation as a provider of choice."</p>
<p>According to GiG, the latest agreement in Switzerland is initially inked for five years. The company pointed out that the deal can be expanded further. GiG predicted that the collaboration is expected to go live at some point in Q1 of 2024. The entry into Switzerland marks an important milestone for the company. Besides expanding the presence of GiG in Europe, the new collaboration extends the company's global footprint too.</p>
<p>Citing data from H2 Gambling, the regulated market in Switzerland is expected to increase to €100m ($109.1m) this year and surpass €440m ($480.1m) by next year. This projection confirms that GiG is in a perfect position to grow further within the Swiss iGaming market and continue to expand its portfolio of partners.</p>
<p>The latest announcement coincided with GiG's finalization of the acquisition of AskGamblers from Catena Media in a deal with a price tag of €45m ($48.9m). The acquisition saw the company acquire AskGamblers, Johnslots.com, Newcasinos.com and several other smaller domains. The total payment was separated into three installments, one set for January 31 this year, as well as two other for January 31, 2024, and January 31, 2025.</p>
<p>Earlier in January, GiG boosted its Latin American presence via a partnership with JOY Enterprise. Before that, the company revealed it joined forces with a major land-based casino operator in Europe by signing a Heads of Terms agreement.</p>
