    <h1>Iowa Casino Hotel Lakeside Hotel Casino Casino Royale James Bond And Vesper Hollywood Casino In Joli</h1>

<p>Dear gurus,</p>
<p>I requested self exclusion from Pelaa.com and all of it’s sister sites, including Casino Masters, in April 2021. After the aforementioned date, however, I have been able to deposit and play significant amounts of money on the two aforementioned casinos. I am not sure of the exact sum. I requested a refund from both. Casino Masters never answered to my request. Pelaa.com initially denied my request but after a complaint here on casino.guru (https://casino.guru/pelaa-casino-player-s-attempt-to-self-exclude-from) they admitted to their failure and issued a refund.</p>
<p>most of the proof relevant to this case can be found in the aforementioned complaint.</p>
<p>Today I contacted casino masters support regarding the refund request hoping to finally get an answer. As response I got contradicting information regarding the case; first I was told I was not entitled to a refund and then that the case has been ’Re-escalated’. I will gladly forward this discussion as further proof.</p>
<p>I played on this website under the exact Same conditions as Pelaa.com, their sister site, who admitted to their failure and issued a refund. It should be clear that legally I should be entitled to a full refund here as well.</p>
<p>please help.</p>
