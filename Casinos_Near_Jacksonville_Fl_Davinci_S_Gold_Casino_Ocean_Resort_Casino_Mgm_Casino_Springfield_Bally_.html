<p>Daniil Medvedev is hoping to defend his Nitto ATP Finals title which he won last year. That’s not going to be easy as he’s got drawn into the Red Group of the 2022 Nitto ATP Finals, together with Stefanos Tsitsipas, Andrey Rublev, and Novak Djokovic.</p>
<p>Djokovic is Medvedev’s toughest opponent in the round-robin phase. Beating Novak is something the Russian has done only once over the last two years, and oddsmakers don’t think his wait is going to end this Sunday. Instead, they see Djoker as an odds-on favorite.</p>

<p>Medvedev Trying to Bounce Back After a First-Round Loss in Paris</p>
<p>This hasn’t been the best year in Medvedev’s career. His overall record in 2022 is 45-16, which isn’t that bad. However, he’s won only two tournaments this season, neither of which was a Grand Slam.</p>
<p>He had a chance to add another trophy to his collection in the French capital, where he arrived as one of the top favorites to win the 2022 ATP Paris. However, Medvedev got stunned by Alex De Minaur in Round 1 – the Aussie player beat him 2-1 (6-4, 2-6, 7-5).</p>
<p>The loss was a huge upset, especially knowing that Medvedev tends to do great against lower-ranked opponents. In fact, his main problem in 2022 has been that he struggles against the players from the Top 10. The bad news for him is that this Sunday, he’s taking on the ATP no. 8 Novak Djokovic.</p>
<p>Djokovic Going for the 6th Record-Tying ATP Finals Win</p>
<p>If Djokovic wins the 2022 ATP Finals, he will tie Roger Federer’s record of six wins. We think the chances of that happening are really good, despite the fact that the Serbian superstar is currently sitting in the no.8 position in the ATP Rankings.</p>
<p>The reason behind such a low placement is that Novak had to miss the Australian Open (for refusing to get vaxxed), while also winning no points for his 2022 Wimbledon triumph.</p>
<p>The good news for him, however, is that he can add another 1,500 ranking points to his tally by winning every match at the 2022 ATP Finals.</p>
<p>Daniil Medvedev vs Novak Djokovic Prediction</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic is playing on another level to Daniil Medvedev. That said, Novak would be our pick even if his opponent was in a superb run. But he isn’t. In fact, Medvedev has been far from impressive this year and we don’t think he’s going to change that at the 2022 ATP Finals.</p>
<p>Picks: Novak Djokovic to win in straight sets</p>
