<p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board released its traditional monthly update on the state’s gambling industry. September retains the momentum inherited by previous months, reporting a year-on-year revenue increase of 8%. If the trend continues, the Silver State should easily surpass 2021’s record-setting profits.</p>
<p>Another Excellent Month for Operators</p>
<p>September is the 19th month in a row when Nevada’s gambling sector’s monthly revenue surpassed $ 1 billion. The state made $1.24billion in total, equating to an 8% increase compared to 2021.</p>
<p>Casinos in The Strip contributed the most once again, bringing in $693 million and enjoying the most substantial monthly increase of 8.25% compared to other regions. It accounted for over 55% of the state’s gaming revenue. The strong showing can provide foresight on the upcoming quarterly reports of its largest operators like Caesars, MGM, and Wynn Resorts.</p>
<p>Nevada Gaming Control Board senior analyst Michael Lawton was optimistic that the state would continue its streak. The coming months should receive a substantial boost from a stacked series of high-profile events like the return of the Global Gaming Expo, performances by Adelle and Elton John, and UFC 282.</p>
<p>We have three months left in the calendar year, and I’m going to go out on a limb and say this year is going to surpass last year. Michael Lawton, Nevada Gaming Control Board senior analyst</p>
<p>This prediction also matches the growing number of visitors. 3.35 million people chose to come to Vegas in September. While the number still lags by 3.5% compared to the pre-pandemic levels, it represents a substantial 14% increase compared to 2021, signaling a healthy upwards trend.</p>
<p>Sportsbook Profits Almost Reached Record Highs</p>
<p>Slot machines continued to dominate the gambling sector, making $858.1 million, which marks a steady 10% year-on-year growth. Table, counter, and card games came in second at $390.8, while baccarat revenue dropped by 3.6% compared to last September, settling at $80.1 million.</p>
<p>Nevada’s sportsbooks were the biggest surprise this September, with revenues just short of November’s $72 million record. The $70.6 million collected is an impressive 30.2% increase compared to last year and can be attributed to the month’s stacked sporting calendar. Online wagers made up 64.6% of all sports betting activity, supporting the growing trend away from land-based establishments.</p>
<p>The Winning Streak Will Likely Continue</p>
<p>While September’s results certainly seem encouraging in the context of post-COVID recovery, experts believe that dark clouds may be on the Horizon. Brendan Bussmann, managing partner of gaming and hospitality-focused consulting firm B Global, told Forbes that $1 billion had now become the standard and warned of some concerning factors that could negatively impact Nevada’s bottom line.</p>
<p>We hit full recovery, plus some, but we have inflation at record levels, and costs are spiraling out of control, which will put pressure on the locals market. Brendan Bussmann, B Global managing partner</p>
<p>Despite growing concerns, Bussmann was optimistic that Nevada would be able to sustain its billion-dollar streak at least until the end of the year. So far, 2022 is proving to be a breath of fresh air for Vegas. With projected profits rising for the foreseeable future, the Silver State should be in a stable-enough position to handle any upcoming downturn.</p>
