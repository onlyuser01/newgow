<p>Hi Liam,</p>
<p>We were not waiting for you to lose or win, again in the T&amp;Cs you will see that it can take up to 4 working days to process withdrawals depending on the amount of cash out requests we have. I will remind you that you were playing during the Christmas holidays and this is why it took more calendar days. Furthermore you were constantly cancelling and requesting new withdrawals and by doing this you reset the whole process. The first time you left a withdrawal in pending for more than a couple of hours was on the 24th of December, we are unable to process any payments on non working days and right after the holidays when we were able to make payments you were informed about the decision and breach of the rules.</p>
<p>As for the full log, you have game history of like 3000 pages, sending this via email is close to impossible. But most important - it is irrelevant, the bets and winnings you made after the wagering completion are not taken into consideration and have nothing to do with the withdrawal. I believe I made it clear that while wagering you made bets higher than the allowed maximum, from there it doesn't matter what you played, how much you bet, how much you won or lost. Those bets caused all your winnings to be voided and balance removed as it was from the same deposit + bonus.</p>
<p>I am sure that you play in other online casinos and all of them will have a maximum bet rule while wagering a bonus and most of them will have less than 10GBP as allowed maximum. Make sure to read the T&amp;Cs in every online casino as they are different and each website sets its own rules and terms.</p>
<p>Take care, Liam. We are sorry for how this turned out, but rules are rules and they apply for everyone.</p>
