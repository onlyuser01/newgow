<p>Player Review: LIMITLESS CASINO</p>
<p>(accepts US players - does not have licensing at time of this review)</p>
<p>Important Points:</p>
<p>-Account verification is required prior to withdrawal- completed within a day via support</p>
<p>-Verification deposit is required prior to first withdrawal "IF" a no deposit code is claimed- crypto deposit minimum is $10 USD</p>
<p>-Withdrawal minimum for crypto is $20- instant to wallet</p>
<p>My initial observation of the platform is the close similarity to Yabby Casino, and they accept US players.</p>
<p>Registration is very straightforward. A valid email address and password are the two requirements to open a player account. The terms and conditions are easily accessible and quite simple to understand, which I consider to be player friendly.</p>
<p>Players can reach support through live chat and/or email. The live chat support agents are very prompt in responding and readily available. Email support was just as quick and replied to my email request within a few minutes. I was pleased to see that the support agents were real people and not a bot sending meaningless responses.</p>
<p>As part of becoming acquainted with the casino, my suggestion is to use a "no deposit code" prior to depositing. I claimed a $100 free chip code in the cashier section of the casino. Reach out to support and make sure you obtain clarification of the bonus terms. I made an inquiry with support to make sure that the bonus terms that accompanied the no deposit code, were consistent with the information received from live support. I didnâ€™t want any surprises. Consistency is a plus with Limitless Casino.</p>
<p>Limitless Casino has a large selection of the most up to date RTG games, provided by SpinLogic. A majority of the games are mobile and desktop friendly. A few games are designated as "Available Only on PC". I was not able to test these games, because they werenâ€™t available on my Mac. On my mobile and desktop, all features of the website ran very smooth. I didnâ€™t experience any glitches, delays, freezing, etc.</p>
<p>The max cash-out for the free chip I used, was $50 USD. Once I met all the T&amp;Cs of the bonus code, I reached out to live chat for assistance with withdrawal. My account was quickly verified after I submitted, via email to support, the requested documentation: a clear picture of the front of my valid identification card and a picture of me holding the same identification card. My account was verified within 3 hours, and I received an email stating I could now proceed with any current and future withdrawals.</p>
<p>In order to withdraw any winnings from a no deposit code, and if you have not made any deposits with Limitless Casino, a verification deposit is required prior to requesting a withdrawal. I was happy to see the minimum deposit for crypto is $10 USD.</p>
<p>Prior to requesting my crypto withdrawal in the cashier, I had to make a crypto deposit of at least $10 USD. Once the deposit was submitted, I was able to request the withdrawal. The deposit does not show up in your player account until after the withdrawal is processed. I received the winning funds in my crypto wallet within 45 min. My player account then showed my deposited funds, which I was able to play or leave for a rainy day.</p>
<p>Each day, subsequent to my first deposit at Limitless casino, I have received free spin codes to my email address. I have received sets of 20, 50, and 75 free spins on various games.</p>
<p>NOTE: I was successful at meeting the wagering requirements on a set of these spins. Not wanting to test my luck, I requested a withdrawal of $20 USD to my crypto wallet. Within 5 minutes of replying to the withdrawal confirmation email, the crypto was in my wallet. The process was unbelievably easy and smooth.</p>
<p>The ONLY issue I could find with Limitless, was the casino failing to have valid licensing. The casino is fairly new, and I hope they are able to get this resolved in the near future. They do offer players the opportunity to complete a player dispute form, which can be located on the bottom of their website, if needed.</p>
<p>Best of luck. I hope your experience is as positive as mine. ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™</p>
