<p>Set to Open in 2022, The Drew Las Vegas Names Bobby Baldwin As CEO</p>
<p>The Drew Las Vegas is going to be one of the most impressive casino resorts on The Strip and, after plenty of setbacks, the project is on a steady path to completion in 2022. As Witkoff Group prepares for the grand opening of the building, the company has named Bobby Baldwin the CEO. If the name sounds familiar, that’s because he is an icon in the poker world.</p>
<p>In 1977, Baldwin became the youngest player to win the World Series of Poker Main Event. He was just 28-years-old, but that record was eventually beaten by Ryan Riess in the 1993 at the age of 23. Other poker legends to meet the record include Joe Cada and Jonathan Duhamel.</p>
<p>Baldwin has had a long poker carerer, amassing $2.1 million in tournament winnings while collecting four WSOP bracelets. He has also claimed seven other cashes in the WSOP. All of his accomplishments in the poker industry led him to be inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2004. The Bellagio even named its high-roller poker room after him – Bobby’s Room.</p>
<p>Eventually, Baldwin moved into the business side of the gaming world. Included on his resume are some very impressive positions such as president of the President of the Bellagio, Mirage and Golden Nugget.</p>
<p>“As we were making final preparations for construction, we had a unique opportunity to work with a transformational leader who has unrivaled experience” – Witkoff CEO Steve Witkoff</p>
<p>The Drew Las Vegas Set to Open in 2022</p>
<p>The Drew Las Vegas originally started out as The Fontainebleau. The project broke ground on 2007, but went bankrupt during the recession in 2009. The next year, it was bought by Carl Icahn but he sold it to Witkoff Group in 2017.</p>
<p>Eventually, Steve Witkoff announced that the venue would be named The Drew, after his son who passed away in 2011. He has high hopes for the property, which will stand 67-stories and 735 feet tall.</p>
<p>There will be 4,000 rooms in the hotel at The Drew, and it will have all sorts of recreational spaces. Restaurants, bars, spas, a theatre and a convention centre will all be available at the property. There will also be a casino floor that spans 95,000 square feet. In total, it will cost $3.1 billion to build.</p>
<p>It is a very exciting venture, and The Drew will surely attract plenty of visitors. We’ll be keeping a close eye on this project and keep you posted of any new developments in the construction.</p>
