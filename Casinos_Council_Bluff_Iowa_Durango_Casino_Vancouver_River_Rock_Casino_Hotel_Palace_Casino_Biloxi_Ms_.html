<p>Solar Disc review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Borrowing its imagery from Central and Southern American cultures and wildlife, Solar Disc is a blend of the native American and American wildlife themes. There are plenty of slots in both categories but few that opt to combine the two together.</p>
<p>The background is a rose-tinted Peruvian plateau, reminiscent of the fields about Machu Picchu, while the foreground is littered with more coins than El Dorado. On the reels, most of the images are of animals. Bold pumas and spectacled bears. But there are also cups and ceremonial masks, stone keys, and ornate tokens.</p>
<p>Solar Disc is wild, magical, and has some of the mystical awe that the monuments of the Aztecs still inspire today.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are Solar Disc’s first positive point. The animals are majestic and mounted on neat backgrounds with patterned frames that work with the theme and add visual spark.</p>
<p>The animations are bright and fun. And are not too over the top. They accentuate, without clouding the visual design.</p>
<p>The audio is where Solar Disc takes a dive in our estimation. Through a horrible error of sound mixing or a composer with a tin ear, the music is highly discordant and vexed by a cacophony of xylophone blows that seem wholly out of sync with the rest of the soundscape.</p>
<p>Turn the sounds off quickly and enjoy the views.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Solar Disc is a six reel slot with four rows and 26 win lines. The player must gamble fifty coins per spin.</p>
<p>There is a free spin bonus, but other than that the gameplay is as stripped down and basic as they come.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol and the Solar Disc symbol. If the player lands 24 Wilds (covering every spot on the reels), they receive 25,000 times their bet per line.</p>
<p>The Solar Disc symbol is turned over at the end of a spin. It will reveal one regular symbol. All examples of that symbol are then turned into Wilds and wins are calculated.</p>
<p>Solar Disc symbol turns random symbol from reels into the Wild symbols</p>
<p>If a Bonus symbol lands along with a Solar Disc, the Free Spins Bonus is triggered. Bonus symbols can only land on reel one.</p>
<p>The Free Spin Bonus consists of ten free spins. During the free spins, a Solar Disc symbol will land on the reels every spin.</p>
<p>Huge win in the Solar Disc free spins</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.01%, almost exactly equal to our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€500.00 per spin. That is a high minimum bet, and a huge maximum bet making this a game for mid to high stakes players. Though your mileage may vary with your preferred site.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility. And the average RTP here is insufficient to make up for such low variance.</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable for Solar Disc slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Solar Disc is beautiful to look at and plays smoothly, even if the gameplay is a little simple.</p>
<p>But its audio leaves a lot to be desired and the medium volatility makes it unhelpful to any player using our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>An average RTP isn’t bad but doesn’t save this slot or gain it our recommendation.</p>
