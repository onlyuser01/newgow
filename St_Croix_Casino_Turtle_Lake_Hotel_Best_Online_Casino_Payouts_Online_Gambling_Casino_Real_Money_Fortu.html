<p>Swedish state-owned online casino operator, Svenska Spel, reaffirmed its ongoing efforts toward research on gambling addiction with grants from its independent research council. On Tuesday, Svenska Spel’s independent research council confirmed it has selected five research studies that received a total of SEK 4.1 million ($377,000) in the form of grants.</p>
<p>The studies seek to help uncover important knowledge about gambling addiction and its impact on others. Additionally, Svenska Spel’s grants seek to help determine effective responsible gambling methods and better ways for treating problem gambling.</p>
<p>Over a decade ago, in 2010, Svenska Spel’s independent research council was founded. Over the last 13 years, the council played a pivotal part by distributing SEK 45 million ($4.2 million) to 35 scientific studies and research projects within the gambling vertical. The latest grants reaffirm its commitment to developing effective methods for treating gambling addiction and gaining valuable knowledge about the impact of such addiction on the people affected and their families.</p>
<p>Sara Lindholm Larsson, Svenska Spel’s chairman of the independent research council, highlighted the importance of the grants this year. She explained that the vital funding will help gain unique insights and knowledge about gambling addiction.</p>
<p>“This year’s granted research project will contribute both to increased knowledge about gambling addiction and which gambling responsibility measures work.“ Sara Lindholm Larsson, chairman of Svenska Spel’s independent research council</p>
<p>According to Larsson, the studies planned for this year will help in the development of more effective guidelines and policies. She pointed out that the studies will help uncover new treatment methods and ways to prevent problem gambling. Finally, Larrson said: “Svenska Spel’s contribution to research and the dissemination of knowledge about games is crucial for many in society today and tomorrow.”</p>
