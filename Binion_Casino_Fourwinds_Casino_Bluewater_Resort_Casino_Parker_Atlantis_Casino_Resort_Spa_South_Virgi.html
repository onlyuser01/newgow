<p>The last time the Buffalo Bills and the Kansas City Chiefs met was in the AFC Championship game in January. Despite a strong start and a 9-0 lead in the first quarter, the Bills ended up losing 38-24 to the Chiefs. Can they get their revenge some ten months later?</p>
<p>Judging by how impressive they’ve been recently, such a scenario doesn’t seem impossible. However, the bookmakers are giving the role of the favorite to Kansas City.</p>

<p>Patrick Mahomes is Back in the Spotlight</p>
<p>The Chiefs are back on the winning track. After losing two straight losses, we finally saw them grabbing a win last weekend. It happened against the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Park.</p>
<p>The Chiefs’ confidence is once again sky-high, not only for winning the game but also for scoring 42 points. They hadn’t scored that many since October 2020.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Chiefs cannot perform well in the offense without Patrick Mahomes performing well. And he was really great in that game, passing for 278 yards and five touchdowns, completing 24 of his 30 passes.</p>
<p>The performance against the Eagles was one of Mahomes’ best performances in his entire career. The big question is can he continue playing such fantastic football?</p>
<p>The answer is yes. After all, Mahomes is considered the best quarterback in the NFL at the moment. Evidence of this is that he is the no.1 favorite to win the MVP award.</p>
<p>With Mahomes In top form, the Chiefs have nothing to worry about their offense. However, their defense does seem leaky.</p>
<p>This is the team that’s already conceded 125 points, which is more than any other team in the AFC. The bad news for them is that they’re taking on one of the best offenses in the entire league.</p>
<p>Can the Bills Outscore the Chiefs?</p>
<p>Anything can happen in the NFL, and knowing how brilliant the Bills have been so far in the offense, it wouldn’t be a massive surprise if they won Sunday’s game.</p>
<p>Together with the Chiefs, they have the best offensive stats in the conference. It’s mostly thanks to their starting quarterback Josh Allen, who’s having a sensational season. Thanks to his input, the Bills were able to score a total of 128 points in the previous three games.</p>
<p>Their rushing game has also been really good this season, with Devin Singletary covering 259 yards in total and Zach Moss scoring three rushing TDs.</p>
<p>They should have no problems to outsmart the Chiefs’ defense on Sunday. In fact, the real question is whether they can score more than Mahomes and his buddies?</p>
<p>Even though the Bills’ defense has been really good so far, the Chiefs offense is just too good for them.</p>
<p>Pick: Kansas City to win; over to hit.</p>
