<p>The leading casino game developer, Playson, announced the launch of a new charity tournament.</p>
<p>Charities in Ukraine to Benefit from New Tournament</p>
<p>The tournament will seek to support good causes in Ukraine and celebrates the company’s 10th anniversary. On Tuesday, Playson encouraged the iGaming industry to join it in supporting its “Big Play is On” tournament. The charity tournament will help six charities based in Ukraine. These are Tabletochki, Dobro, Be Kind, Prytula Foundation, Enjoying Life, as well as Come Back Alive.</p>
<p>“Having a significant number of Ukrainians in its team, the supplier wishes to support those that are doing a wonderful job during a difficult time for Ukraine,” reads a statement released by Playson</p>
<p>The company explained that participants that are interested to join the tournament can do so at any time. The event itself is expected to run for 10 hours between 12 AM and 10 PM CET. According to Playson, the top ten participants will receive a €1,000 ($1,020) donation which can be transferred to a charity they decide. What’s more, thanking its members for their contribution, the company vowed to award the top ten members with Amazon gift cards worth $100.</p>
<p>Alex Ivshin, CEO at Playson Shares His Excitement</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Playson’s CEO, Alex Ivshin, said that in the last ten years, the company has seen plenty of growth, joy and success. He added that it is thrilling to see Playson as a leading supplier that offers quality content titles that are well received by its partners. What’s more, Ivshin pointed out that Playson is ready to continue expanding and reach its next level of growth. He also thanked the company’s partners that have supported its growth in the last decade and predicted further partnerships in the years to come.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to have cemented ourselves as a supplier that offers quality, high-performing titles, which consistently produce results for our partners.” Alex Ivshin, CEO of Playson</p>
<p>Ivshin acknowledged that the company has a lot of Ukraine-based employees and it has been seeking for new ways to help their communities during this difficult time. He added: “Several of our employees have volunteered and donated throughout this turbulent time, and now we want to act as a company and deliver much-needed funds to a host of wonderful Ukrainian organizations.” In conclusion, Playson’s CEO pointed out that the company hopes to see the success of its charity tournament which will ultimately help good causes in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Late last month, Playson expanded its reach in Germany via a deal with PlatinCasino. The collaboration saw the leading iGaming content developer introduce leading titles for PlatinCasino in the country. Additionally, the new deal helped Playson expand its reach further into the European regulated iGaming market.</p>
