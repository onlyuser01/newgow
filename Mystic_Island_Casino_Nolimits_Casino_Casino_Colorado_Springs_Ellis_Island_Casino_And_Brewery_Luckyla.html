<p>10Mth Tourists at Las Vegas’ Eiffel Tower Greeted by Showgirls, Celebs</p>

<p>Two Brits in Vegas to get married got baguettes, berets and some excitement for being the 10 millionth visitors to the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Hotel and Casino.</p>
<p>Martin Layton and his fiancee Sarah Connell came all the way from the UK to be married in Las Vegas; nothing particularly unusual about that, of course. What made their escapade unique, however, was becoming the 10,000,000th visitors to the Las Vegas’ Eiffel Tower at the Paris Hotel, replete with dancing girls and celebrities.</p>
<p>Entertainers On Hand</p>
<p>Not only showgirls greeted the surprised couple; American Idol winner and now Las Vegas performer Taylor Hicks, the cast of the Jersey Boys, and, the inevitable mime were also on hand to congratulate the delighted duo, Vegas-style.</p>
<p>It was old-school Vegas showmanship, but it still tickled the engaged Brits.</p>
<p>“Here we are,” said Martin Layton. “I still can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>Mind you, with it just a hop, skip and a jump across the Pond, these two have been to the real Eiffel Tower in Paris. But no one at the one in France made them feel this special. In fact, like some kookie 1960s episode of “Candid Camera”, the Paris marketing team was actually waiting and watching for # 10M to enter (since the property’s opening in 1999), so they could pounce.</p>
<p>Followed by Marketing</p>
<p>Naturally, they had to set up their marks, so as the couple stepped onto the Tower’s elevator, the marketing team followed, pretending to be shooting a video marketing promotion and asking the couple if they would mind being interviewed for it. This being 2013 and everyone having imagined being on their own reality TV show by now, naturally, Layton and Connell said sure, fine.</p>
<p>Until the interview ended, everyone got off the elevator, and the pair still felt like they were being tailed.</p>
<p>“Are they still following us?” Layton asked his fiancee.</p>
<p>After coming around a corner, the pair first eyed the lavishly dressed showgirls, but assumed they were just there to Vegas the Tower up a bit. Until the leggy performers actually came towards them, that is. And next thing you know, the Jersey Boys’ cast and Taylor Hicks (who happens to have a gig at the Paris right now) appeared out of nowhere, along with champagne, TV cameras and the inevitable casino execs, trying not to look completely ennuied about the whole thing.</p>
<p>And then – because there is no bottom to “kitsch” when it comes to Vegas – Taylor Hicks and the Jersey cast actually sang out ““You’re our 10 millionth guest,” which prob made the Brits cringe the way most of us do when the waitstaff at Chile’s sings “Happy Birthday” at a co-workers’ lunch gathering.</p>
<p>Then they got to see the launch of some 5,000 red, white and blue biodegradable balloons and were awarded a seven-day trip for two to the real and actual Paris, France.</p>
<p>What, no gambling cash, you cheapskates?</p>
<p>As exciting as being the 10,000,000th Eiffel Tower visitor no doubt was, we have a feeling they might have been even more wowed by their subsequent day trips to the Grand Canyon and the Hoover Dam, even if no one sang to them upon arrival.</p>
<p>And it all makes for a good story back home in England, over a spot of tea.</p>
