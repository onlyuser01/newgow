<p>Witnesses told the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department they heard repeated gunfire at about 9:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The casino is located at the intersection of Rainbow Boulevard and Twain Avenue, about four miles west of the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Police didn’t have an update as of Friday on the condition of the wounded pair. The shooting victims were found in different locations, though both were relatively close to the casino, KLAS, a local TV station, reported. No arrests were made in the case as of early Friday. Police have yet to release details on the case.</p>
<p>Dotty’s Casino is a chain of gaming properties that features slot machines. They have locations in Nevada, Oregon, and Montana.</p>
<p>Earlier Robbery, Murder</p>
<p>In May, a winning female player was robbed at another Dotty’s location, also in Spring Valley. The suspect fled to a parked SUV, which later allegedly drove over the location’s manager, Alicia Gibellina, 60. She died from her injuries.</p>
<p>The alleged robber, Samuel Schmid, 28, apparently targeted the winning player after she won about $30,000 at the casino.</p>
<p>Gibellina ran into the parking lot after the robbery to prevent Schmid’s escape. He allegedly pulled out a firearm when she approached the vehicle. She then moved behind the SUV, which backed up and ran her over. She died an hour later from blunt force injuries, the Clark County coroner’s office ruled.</p>
<p>The incident took place at the Dotty’s situated in a mall at Flamingo Road and Jones Boulevard.</p>
<p>A conspirator, James Holmes, 54, helped Schmid identify the player. Schmid is suspected of exchanging phone messages with Holmes before the robbery took place, police said. Holmes allegedly watched the player win several jackpots that day, according to KLAS.</p>
<p>Officers located Schmid’s cell phone on the floor inside the casino. It apparently had fallen out of his pocket during the robbery. A search of the phone revealed photos of Schmid. It also had texts of messages between Schmid and Holmes.</p>
<p>The winning player suffered non-life-threatening injuries during the robbery. She went to a local hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Both Suspects in Jail</p>
<p>Schmid was booked on May 29. His charges include open murder, robbery, battery, and conspiracy. His case is pending. He remains in custody, according to online records from the Clark County Detention Center.</p>
<p>Holmes, who was also booked in May, remains in custody at the Clark County Detention Center. He faces the same charges as Schmid.</p>
