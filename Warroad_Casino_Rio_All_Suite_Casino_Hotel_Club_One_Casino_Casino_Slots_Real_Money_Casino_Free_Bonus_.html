    <h1>Warroad Casino Rio All Suite Casino Hotel Club One Casino Casino Slots Real Money Casino Free Bonus</h1>

<p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.spinupcasino.com/general-terms-conditions/?lang=en :</p>
<p>"Betting Guidelines</p>
<p>. A player must take into consideration the rules of the game he is on while betting.</p>
<p>. "Total bets" is defined as the sum of individual bets (lines, chips, hands, etc.) within a round, i.e., the total bet amount when clicking the "spin" or "play" or equivalent button.</p>
<p>. The Casino reserves the right to withhold any withdrawal request, which includes to remove all bonuses or winnings in the case of Irregular Play in case of the followings:</p>
<p>Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the smallest deposit currently in play. Including purchasing in-game features including but not limited to free spins with a total bet amount of 30% or greater than the value of the deposit.</p>
<p>Placing wagers that are 30% or more then the value of the bonus (the smallest one among them) currently in play within the bonus wagering requirements are fulfilled.</p>
<p>Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the smallest Cashback Bonus currently in play.</p>
<p>Purchasing in-game features including but not limited to free spins with a total bet amount of 30% or greater than the value of the deposit or bonus (the smallest one among them) currently in play.</p>
<p>Switching the game category from Slots to Table or Other games while betting using the bonus amount before the bonus wagering requirements are filled.</p>
<p>Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the sum of the comp points redeemed."</p>
<p>Could you please confirm that you haven’t activated any bonus when depositing funds into your account? How much was your deposit? Ideally, please forward any relevant communication and your game history to petronela.k@casino.guru. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
