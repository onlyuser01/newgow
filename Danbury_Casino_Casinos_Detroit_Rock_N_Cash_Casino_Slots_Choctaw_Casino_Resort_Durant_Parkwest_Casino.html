<p>Fat Santa review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Players will find themselves inside the friendly world of a Christmas special with this game.</p>
<p>Set in the snowy North Pole, this slot is cheerful and welcoming. Players will encounter adorable snowmen, cheeky elves, and bashful reindeer. Each character has a unique personality and hits the right balance between cute and entertaining.</p>
<p>A softly glowing cabin welcomes players, who will feel like they are part of a classic Christmas story. The kindly Santa is hungry for Christmas pies, and players will feel pleased to see him find his treats.</p>
<p>The wholesome atmosphere is so cosy that players will be happy to play even when it isn’t Christmastime.</p>
<p>Activated Santa's Sleigh feature adds random amount of Pie Wild symbols to the game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The optional music is upbeat and filled with sleigh bells. Some players may choose to keep it muted as the loop can become repetitive.</p>
<p>The animation style brings to mind a classic Christmas cartoon. The gently falling snow and decorated cabin seem so snug that players will linger.</p>
<p>The whimsical characters seem to be part of a lighthearted adventure that players will want to share. The world feels like a place where magical things happen and this makes spins feel especially enchanted.</p>
<p>Best of all is the animation of Santa gobbling up his pies. His friendly expression transforms as he opens his mouth as wide as possible to eat each dessert.</p>
<p>On Santa’s list, this game is definitely on the nice side.</p>
<p>Big win in the Fat Santa slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fat Santa is a five reel, five row slot, with fifty win lines.</p>
<p>The gameplay moves at a cheerful pace and the reels move satisfyingly fast.</p>
<p>The Buy Feature allows players to immediately activate the Free Games Feature (see below for details). This costs 80 times the player's current bet, which the player confirms prior to going forward.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Fat Santa Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Christmas Pie and Wild Christmas Pie Symbol also serve as Wild symbols. They do not substitute for the Fat Santa symbol.</p>
<p>The Free Games Feature is triggered when a Santa symbol and a Wild Christmas Pie symbol land anywhere on the reels at the same time.</p>
<p>Fat Santa Wild symbol travels around and eats up any Wild Christmas Pie symbols between spins</p>
<p>While in the Free Games Feature, players will see the Santa symbol go to the Christmas Pie symbols and eat them up. These consumed Christmas Pie symbols are added to the Christmas Pie meter. When the Christmas Pie meter is full, the Fat Santa symbol increases in size, covering more squares on the reels. The more pies, the bigger your wins as the number of winning combos increases.</p>
<p>Each 5 eaten Wild Christmas Pie symbols add more free spins and size of Fat Santa Wild symbol</p>
<p>At random, the Santa’s Sleigh Feature begins, flying over the reels. Santa’s sleigh leaves a trail of Christmas Pie symbols in randomized positions. These symbols then act as Wild symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.45%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€25.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less optimal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Fat Santa slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility Christmas-themed slot.</p>
<p>This game makes up for its mediocre volatility with its cute graphics, cosy setting and good RTP. This slot is an especially good match for players who are more interested in a fun gaming experience, rather than the highest wins.</p>
<p>With opportunities for diverse gameplay, Fat Santa keeps things interesting while making players feel welcome in its wholesome world.</p>
