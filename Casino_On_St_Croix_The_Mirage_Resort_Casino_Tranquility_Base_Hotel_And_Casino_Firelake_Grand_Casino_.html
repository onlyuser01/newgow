    <h1>Casino On St Croix The Mirage Resort Casino Tranquility Base Hotel And Casino Firelake Grand Casino</h1>

<p>Gambling revenue in Spain increased by 3% year-on-year for the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Figures from Spanish regulator the Directorate General for the Regulation of Gambling (DGOJ) showed that revenue for the three months up until 30 June 2021 was €216m ($253m) representing a slight increase on last year’s results. However, this was 10% lower than Q1.</p>
<p>Casino revenue made up the majority of the overall figures, bringing in €99.9m which was 46% of the total share and a 7% rise from last year. €92m came from sports betting which made up 46% of the overall total and was a 35% increase from the same period last year. However, this was 17% lower from Q1 but the European football season winding down from May could be the reason for this. As a result, conventional counterpart sports bets fell 9% from Q1. Elsewhere, €3.27m of the market’s overall revenue generated from bingo and €20.34m in poker.</p>
<p>Players deposited €675.6m during the period which was up by 42% from last year. There was an 11% decrease in the amount of monthly active gaming accounts from Q1, down to 991,196, which was 54% lower than the year prior. But there was a 68% yearly increase in the monthly average of new accounts, up to 231,167.</p>
<p>Overall marketing spend was €128.41m for the quarter, with marketing expenses 13% lower than Q1.</p>
<p>The Spanish gambling market was regulated in 2011 and there are currently 80 operators offering online gaming services in the country.</p>
<p>Last November, the Spanish Government passed the Royal Decree on Commercial Communications. This prohibited gambling sponsorship on premises, sports teams or competitions, stopped welcome bonuses and limited commercial audio-visual advertisements to between 1am and 5am.</p>
