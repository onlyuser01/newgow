<p>888 continues to grow its presence in the African market, which is an important future opportunity for operators from the world over</p>
<p>Not only is the continent fast-developing but is it also attracting some of the biggest names in the industry, and 888 is no exception. 888AFRICA, the part-owned entity by 888, has said that it is buying out BetLion, a sportsbook, which is part of the company’s grander plans for the region.</p>
<p>BetLion to Help with 888AFRICA’s Ambitious Growth Plans</p>
<p>BetLion offers both sports betting and iGaming products and it has been licensed in multiple jurisdictions across the region, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Zambia. The company is headquartered in Nairobi and 888AFRICA is now increasing its local presence significantly.</p>
<p>BetLion managing director Robert Chirchir has welcomed the opportunity to see his company change ownership and end up with one of the most ambitious and fast-developing businesses on the continent – 888AFRICA. Chirchir added that he was happy to see BetLion become a part of this journey as the company is determined to pursue a market-leading position locally.</p>
<p>Chirchir also spoke of synergies and the mutual benefits of this partnership. “We look forward to working more closely with the team and continuing to delight customers with our joint offer,” he added.</p>
<p>888AFRICA’s Christopher Coyne commented on this new opportunity and said that his company is determined to create one of the most unique betting and gaming experiences that is available to players in Africa.</p>
<p>“We also look forward to working with our new colleagues and introducing new customers to our local brands,” Coyne added. He described the acquisition as a critical step and described the BetLion brand as one of the best-suited operators that will fit right with 888AFRICA’s ambitious growth model which will further strengthen the company’s presence in the market.</p>
<p>Africa, a Continent of Opportunity for Gaming</p>
<p>Africa is undergoing a fast evolution of gambling industry interest, which has been kept mostly on the down-low, but companies such as 888AFRICA have chosen to go straight through the front door.</p>
<p>888AFRICA made waves in the continent as it first rolled out the 888bet brand back in 2022, starting with four markets, to name Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique, and Kenya. However, the company is clearly determined to garner even more momentum in the coming months and years, and this means strategic acquisitions as is the case with BetLion.</p>
