<p>Nevada’s casino giants prepare for the reopening of business. On Tuesday, May 26 a conference will determine when casinos will reopen.</p>
<p>Results Following Memorial Day Weekend Pending Analysis</p>
<p>Much has been said for Nevada’s gaming business since the lockdown began in mid-March. Following Friday’s announcement by Governor Steve Sisolak, a press conference is planned to be held this coming Tuesday, May 26. Gaming Control Board data as well as data trends surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19) will be carefully examined until a decision is made on the launch date for Phase 2 of the governor’s plan and the reopening of casinos.</p>
<p>While both employers and employees are patiently waiting for the relaxation of measures, Gov. Sisolak has already noted in the past that the best way to restart the industry would be with the help of careful planning and phased restart. Following the governor’s announcement on Friday, it is now clear that he has set a target date on June 4 for the restart of the state’s gaming industry.</p>
<p>However, this can only be achieved if a positive or at least a consistent trend is observed following the Memorial Day Weekend’s coronavirus (COVID-19) results. With that being said, the gaming industry in the Silver State is already planning the long awaited return back to business.</p>
<p>Does the New Face of Las Vegas Wear A Mask?</p>
<p>The Silver State’s gaming industry giants are preparing for reopening, but here is what some of them commented on the upcoming casino restart. Discussing a potential return, MGM Resorts International chief executive and president Bill Hornbuckle said: “We all know what we’ve gone through for the last 10 weeks. No one’s having fun.” He continued by saying: “The simple idea that I could get out, come to a resort, lay at a pool, enjoy a nice dinner, sit at a blackjack table. There’s something to be said for all of that.”</p>
<p>Visitors of the famous The Venetian by Las Vegas Sands will see the gondola pilot with a mask. Furthermore, both The Venetian and Wynn Resorts are considering thermal image cameras installation.</p>
<p>Given the guidelines for reopening that were released by the state regulator earlier in May, Las Vegas will likely be looking differently upon restarting its casino business. Social distancing, enhanced cleaning of high-traffic areas, vendors with masks and hand sanitizers available everywhere mark some of the measures expected upon reopening of the resorts.</p>
<p>Some hotels are considering keyless check-ins with the help of mobile devices. Casino’s card decks will be replaced more often, gaming chips will be cleaned and even dice will be sanitized for each player. As per the guidelines by the Nevada Gaming Commission Board (NGCB) there will be reduced seats for players at blackjacks, craps, roulette and poker tables. Both hotels and casinos occupancy will be limited. All restrictive measures, though reasonable and needed, will undoubtedly change the way Las Vegas looks once business returns back to normal.</p>
