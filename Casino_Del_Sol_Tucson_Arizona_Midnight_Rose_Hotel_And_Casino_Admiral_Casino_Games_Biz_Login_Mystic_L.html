<p>Anthony Joshua vs. Otto Wallin is the main event of the Day of Reckoning event, scheduled for December 23, 2023, in Kingdom Arena, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>Anthony Joshua‚Äôs odds suggest he‚Äôs going to have a relatively easy job in Saudi Arabia, but only if he doesn‚Äôt underestimate his opponent. Otto Wallin is someone who‚Äôs only lost once, and it happened against Tyson Fury. Plus, the loss in question was a loss by decision.</p>

<p>Anthony Joshua Plotting His Comeback to the Top</p>
<p>From 2017 to 2019, Anthony Joshua was in possession of four heavyweight titles ‚Äì WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO. Then, in 2019, Andy Ruiz Jr. shocked the world by beating AJ by a TKO.</p>
<p>That still remains one of the biggest betting upsets in the history of boxing as the Mexican fighter was a +1300 underdog before the bout. AJ got his belts back in the rematch, but rather disappointingly, he didn‚Äôt get spectacular revenge. Instead, he beat his foe by decision.</p>
<p>His second reign as the heavyweight champ in four federations lasted for one fight only (a KO win over Kubrat Pulev). The Englishman lost the titles to Oleksandr Usyk in 2021 who beat him by unanimous decision.</p>

<p>A year later, he got a chance to get them back, but the Ukrainian beat him again, this time by a split decision. It was a tense match, but what happened after the bout got into the headlines. AJ had a sort of meltdown, taking the mic from Usyk and rambling all sorts of confusing stuff for a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>This made boxing fans that he‚Äôs got some serious emotional problems that could have a negative impact on his career. However, he proved his doubter wrong this year. In 2023, he‚Äôs fought twice already, beating Jermaine Franklin by unanimous decision and Robert Helenius by a KO.</p>
<p>Can Otto Wallin Stage an Upset in Riyadh?</p>
<p>Otto Wallin is 26-1-1 in his professional boxing career, with 14 wins by KO/TKO. He‚Äôs got one no-contest under his belt, which happened against Nick Kisner in 2019 after an accidental headbutt.</p>
<p>His only loss happened the same year to legendary Tyson Fury. It was a close fight, though. He went back and forth with ‚ÄúThe Gypsy King‚Äù for the full 12 rounds, losing by unanimous decision in the end.</p>
<p>Since then, however, ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù is undefeated. He‚Äôs won his last six bouts, with his most recent win earning him the WBA Inter-Continental title. He took it from Murat Gassiev whom he defeated by a split decision in Turkey.</p>
<p>That wasn‚Äôt Wallin‚Äôs best performance, especially given that Gassiev is a former cruiserweight fighter who‚Äôs shorter, lighter, and less powerful than Wallin‚Äôs next opponent.</p>
<p>Anthony Joshua vs. Otto Wallin Prediction</p>
<p>If Anthony Joshua‚Äôs mental and emotional issues are behind him, he‚Äôs going to win this fight. The evidence that he‚Äôs doing alright is that he‚Äôs won two bouts this year already. We think he‚Äôs going to win this one too, which could get him back in the conversation about possible title fights in 2024.</p>
<p>Pick: Anthony Joshua</p>
