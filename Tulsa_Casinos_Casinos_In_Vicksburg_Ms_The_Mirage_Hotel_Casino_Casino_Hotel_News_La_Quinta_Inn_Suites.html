<p>Evolution, a company that specializes in the development of hard-hitting live table games of the highest quality, has strengthened its collaboration with the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) in Canada. This builds upon a five-year relationship with the company. As a result, players will get to enjoy new high-limit live casino games in three provinces, including British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.</p>
<p>The new games are VIP Blackjack and VIP Baccarat which will add to the selection of excellent titles available at BCLC and further introduce players to more worthwhile live casino experiences. To ensure the highest quality of gaming action, Evolution will be broadcasting its games from the Vancouverstudio and will bring the action closer to players in all of the aforementioned provinces.</p>
<p>Furthermore, BCLC already runs a number of excellent game genres on its PlayNow.com platform and it will strengthen this with the introduction of the new VIP format designed to appeal to high rollers. Evolution CCO for North America, Jeff Millar, welcomed the introduction of more games to BCLC and its players.</p>
<p>Millar said that the latest collaboration extended an ongoing collaboration with BCLC which was signed in 2018. It was the first major expansion outside of Europe, Millar added.</p>
<p>"Since then, our relationship with BCLC has gone from strength to strength. We are proud to launch these new VIP tables and confident that VIP players will be attracted by this premium online gaming experience," he concluded.</p>
<p>Today, Evolution is a well-represented brand across the North American continent. The company has been enjoying a series of launches not just in Canada, but also down the border with the United States. Evolutionâ€™s games were introduced to Caesars in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Another rollout was accomplished in Michigan where the company launched its Craps Live Casino game. Evolution has also been strengthening its lineup across the board, with the addition of games such as Funky Time, a 70s disco-themed title that is designed to further strengthen the innovative portfolio the supplier has to bring to partners.</p>
