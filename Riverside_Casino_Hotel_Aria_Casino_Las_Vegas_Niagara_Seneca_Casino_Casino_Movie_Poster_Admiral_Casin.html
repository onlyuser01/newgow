    <h1>Riverside Casino Hotel Aria Casino Las Vegas Niagara Seneca Casino Casino Movie Poster Admiral Casin</h1>

<p>Deposited and played with my own money without any bonus funds attached to my deposit.</p>
<p>Upon winning and requesting a withdrawal of $1450 my withdrawal seemed to be processed.</p>
<p>The casino then offered me a free chip of $25 after my withdrawal was already processed and funds had been deducted from my account. I played the free chip they offered and the following day I was advised via email that my winnings had been voided due because I had played the free chip that was offered after my withdrawal request was already processed.</p>
<p>Clearly frustrated and upset I contacted the casinos support via chat and was told I violated terms and conditions. How is it possible to violate a previous cash deposit by accepting a $25 free chip that was offered after my withdrawal request was made? I had no bonus attached to my deposit so this makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
