<p>All the Reasons Why Vergil Ortiz Jr‚Äôs Odds are as Short as -400</p>
<p>Vergil Ortiz Jr is only 25 and he already has a formidable portfolio. As you‚Äôd expect, he started as an amateur boxer, winning the national title on seven occasions, as well as winning gold at the Junior Olympics.</p>
<p>He turned pro in the summer of 2016, and is undefeated since. He‚Äôs 19-0 in his professional career, with all of those wins happening by KO/TKO. With a finish rate of 100%, it‚Äôs no surprise boxing fans think of him as the next big thing in the welterweight division.</p>
<p>Another FOTY contender? ü§î Give us your two cents about #StanionisOrtizJr below and let us know who you're rockin' with this Saturday.#ThisIsTheMoment #StanionisOrtizJr | LIVE on DAZN July 8th pic.twitter.com/L7oM0UKXax ‚Äî Golden Boy (@GoldenBoyBoxing) July 3, 2023</p>
<p>Actually, Vergil Ortiz Jr is already a big thing in this weight class, having won two championship belts already. Can he add another one to his collection? Ortiz Jr‚Äôs odds sure suggest so.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not only because of his impressive record with a 100% knockout-to-win ratio, but also because of the fact that this Saturday he‚Äôs fighting in front of his own crowd. As a reminder, the Eimantas Stanionis vs. Vergil Ortiz Jr bout is taking place in his home state of Texas.</p>
<p>Can Eimantas Stanionis Upset the Odds on July 8?</p>
<p>Betting odds go up or down depending on the bettors‚Äô behavior. If they‚Äôre pouring money on one boxer, that guy‚Äôs odds are bound to get shorter. Considering that there‚Äôs so much hype about Vergil Ortiz Jr, it‚Äôs clear that bettors are betting on this guy. In turn, this has made his odds very short. Priced at -400, Vergil Ortiz Jr looks certain to win.</p>
<p>But stranger things have happened in professional boxing, and Eimantas Stanionis definitely looks like someone who can upset the odds. He‚Äôs no tomato can, with an impressive portfolio with 14 wins, one no contest, and zero losses thus far.</p>
<p>He won the WBA (regular) welterweight title in April 2022 after beating Radzhab Butaev by a split decision. It may not seem impressive but beating ‚ÄúThe Python‚Äù by any method is a huge achievement. The Dagestani boxer was undefeated before that bout, with 14 wins and one no contest. Plus, his odds beating -164 before the Stanionis fight.</p>
<p>Eimantas Stanionis vs. Vergil Ortiz Jr Prediction</p>
<p>With 19 straight KO/TKO wins and a huge support from his fans, Vergil Ortiz Jr is almost 100% certain to go all-in on July 8. The Texan wants another win inside the distance, but for this, he‚Äôll need to take risk. And a risky fighting style can easily turn into a disaster.</p>
<p>Eimantas Stanionis is a smart tactical fighter, who can exploit the opposition‚Äôs mistakes. That‚Äôs exactly what he‚Äôll try to do on Saturday, and we think he might pull it off.</p>
