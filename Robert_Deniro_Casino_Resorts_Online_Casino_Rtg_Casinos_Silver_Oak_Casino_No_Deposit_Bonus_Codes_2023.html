<p>Two proposals are currently calling for the legalization of sports betting in California. The results of a new study reveal that the pair of propositions do not have a great chance of passing in November.</p>
<p>Californians Unlikely to Support Competing Sports Betting Proposals</p>
<p>The UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies released details regarding a new study on Tuesday. The poll was co-sponsored by The Times and reveals that the two proposals calling for the legalization of sports betting are unlikely to pass in November. One of the proposals is supported by the Tribal operators in California, while the other one is backed by online sports betting companies.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the competitiveness of each of the involved parties is significant, which started a local multi-million “war” over which proposal will get the attention of the voters and receive approval. So far, Tribal operators and commercial sports betting companies have spent more than $400 million in supporting their proposals which made the ballot initiative one of the most expensive in the US. But judging by the results of the recent study, neither of the involved parties may like the possible outcome in November.</p>

<p>More People Likely to Vote against the Initiatives, Says Study</p>
<p>One of the initiatives, Proposition 26, is supported by the Tribes in California. It calls for introducing retail sports wagering at four horse racing tracks, as well as tribal casinos. According to the results of the recent study, fewer people may vote yes for Proposition 26 than the ones that will reject it. The study reveals that 31% of the likely voters may support the initiative, while 42% may vote against it. Another 27% admitted they still haven’t decided whether to support the proposal or not.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Proposition 27 is supported by major gambling operators within the sports betting industry such as DraftKings, FanDuel and BetMGM. Their proposal calls for the legalization of online sports wagering. Focusing on the results of the new study, the people that may vote against Proposition 27 are significantly more. Overall, 53% of the respondents of the study admitted they would not support Proposition 27, while only 27% admitted they are likely to vote in favor. Some 20% admitted they have not decided whether or not they will support the online sports wagering legalization.</p>
<p>“I think it’s the negative advertisements that have kind of been turning voters away.“ Mark DiCamillo, poll director at Berkeley IGS</p>
<p>Mark DiCamillo, Berkeley IGS’ poll director, cited by the Los Angeles Times, acknowledged that voters are likely turned away by negative advertising. He explained that the people who haven’t seen ads are more or less “evenly divided.” However, DiCamillo outlined that people who have seen lots of advertisements are certainly against the legalization of sports betting. Last but not least, he pointed out that “advertising is not helping.”</p>
