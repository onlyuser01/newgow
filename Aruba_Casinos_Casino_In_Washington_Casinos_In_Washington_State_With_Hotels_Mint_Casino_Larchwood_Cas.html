<p>The leading provider of casino entertainment within the regulated gambling market in Italy, NetBet Italy, announced details regarding a new collaboration, allowing it to further expand its portfolio of offering. On Monday, the company revealed it joined forces with the London-based provider of games for the online gambling vertical, Gaming Realms.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, Gaming Realms agreed to supply games, powering NetBet Italy's operations. Per the new deal, clients of the operator will be able to access unique new games, bringing engaging and exciting experiences. While the new content deal helps Gaming Realms expand significantly the reach of its content, it also benefits NetBet Italy by bringing a new selection of engaging casino games for its customers.</p>
<p>Claudia Georgevici, NetBet Italy's PR Manager, shared her excitement about the new deal with Gaming Realms in a statement released on June 19, 2023. "Here at NetBet, we're dedicated to delivering an exceptional iGaming experience to every one of our players," she said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Georgevici pointed out: "Gaming Realms is a name we've had on our books for a while, so we're thrilled to have them on board and to be able to offer their incredible portfolio to NetBet Italy customers." Finally, NetBet Italy's PR Manager pointed out: "We look forward to building on this new partnership and offering more exciting games."</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration NetBet Italy customers will be able to tap into Gaming Realms' catalog of games. Such titles include the developer's popular concept that combines bingo and slots to deliver a product known as Slingo games.</p>
<p>As a result, customers in Italy will be able to experience Gaming Realms' Slingo Extreme, Slingo Fortune, as well as Slingo Deal No Deal, among other popular titles. Ensuring convenience for online players, the developer's titles are suitable for mobile, as well as desktop devices.</p>
<p>In mid-May, NetBet Italy forged another deal, allowing it to expand its portfolio of content. At the time, the company confirmed it signed a content deal with RAW iGaming, a fast-growing provider of engaging casino games. The collaboration enabled NetBet Italy's customers to access new and thrilling games, while at the same time, RAW iGaming expanded the reach of its titles.</p>
<p>Earlier in May, NetBet Italy announced another partnership by teaming up with the popular provider of games for the iGaming industry, G Games. As a result, games from the provider helped enrich the operator's offering, reaffirming its leadership position within the market in Italy.</p>
