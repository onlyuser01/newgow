    <h1>How Old To Go To Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Atlantic City Lake Of The Torches Resort Casino Bronc</h1>

<p>In connection with the upcoming soccer World Cup that will take place in Qatar in 2023, Checkd Dev is launching 2022 World Cup as part of the popular free fantasy sports game Sky Sports Fantasy Football (SSFF).</p>
<p>The new enhancement of the renowned fantasy gaming product is the cherry on top of the design and production of a mobile application and a web-based platform for the SSFF that Checkd Dev executed ahead of the 2021-2022 soccer season.</p>
<p>The recently rebuilt platform achieved an astounding record of stability, which meant that during the whole season starting at the end of the summer in 2021 and ending in Spring 2022 the platform did not experience any downtime whatsoever. In addition to the new World Cup fantasy soccer game, Checkd Group will also provide the media voice of Sky Sports Fantasy Football ahead of the big tournament in Qatar.</p>
<p>One of the major focus points of the media campaign, which will be executed by Checkd Media, will be the possibility for bettors to choose players like Manchester City star Erling Haaland for their teams.</p>
<p>The recently elongated media partnership with Checkd Media, which also includes a campaign in connection with this season’s Premier League, is due to the performance achievements of the previous campaign in connection with soccer season 2021-2022.</p>
<p>With last season’s campaign, Checkd Media reached more than 18 million impressions and over 1.5 million views.</p>
<p>Executives from Sky Bet and Checkd Dev Highlight the Benefits of the Enhanced Partnership</p>
<p>In connection with the record achievement during the previous soccer season and the new addition of the World Cup to the fantasy sports product range, Sky Bet senior product manager Luke Lockwood commented:</p>
<p>Sky Sports Fantasy Football is a hugely popular game and it is vital that we utilize a platform that provides stability as well as enhanced features for our players. Luke Lockwood, senior product manager, Sky Bet</p>
<p>Lockwood highlighted that Checkd Dev will provide an unparalleled fantasy sports World Cup game on both mobile and desktop, while the media partnership with Checkd Media will drive engagement around the contest and is expected to bring a lot of new sign-ups.</p>
<p>While Will Tyrell, director of UK Media at Checkd Media, focused on the great performance of Sky Sports Fantasy Football across various communities as a result of the promotional activities of Checkd Media executed during the previous soccer season. Tyrell also noted he expects that the company will put together an equally engaging and entertaining campaign during this season and particularly in connection with the upcoming World Cup tournament.</p>
