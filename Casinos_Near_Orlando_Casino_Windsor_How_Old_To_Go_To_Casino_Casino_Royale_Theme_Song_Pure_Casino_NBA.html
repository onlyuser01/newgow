<p>The NBA free agent class of the summer of 2019 is packed with superstars, and the three most valuable assets in the pool are Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and Kyrie Irving.</p>

<p>Durant, the 2014 MVP and a two-time NBA Finals MVP, declined his player option of $31.5 million with the Golden State Warriors to become an unrestricted free agent. Though he will likely miss all of next season due to the torn Achilles he suffered in Game 5 of the Finals, the superstar will receive four-year max contracts from numerous teams.</p>
<p>The Warriors can offer him the most, a five-year deal worth $221 million. Other teams can make a max offer of four years for $164 million.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers have the Brooklyn Nets the favorite at +100 to land Durant. ESPN NBA insider Stephen A. Smith said recently regarding Durant and Irving both moving to Brooklyn, “I’m pretty much hearing it’s done. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are going to Brooklyn.”</p>
<p>Durant staying in Golden State is at +235. He’s expected to also field offers from the New York Knicks (+300), Los Angeles Clippers (+800), Los Angeles Lakers (+900), and Dallas Mavericks (+2000).</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook currently has the Nets at 25/1 to win the 2019-20 NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Who’s Going Where</p>
<p>The Durant to Brooklyn scenario is gaining traction among sports bettors. As a result, the sportsbook at Caesars Palace has shortened the Nets’ odds of landing the 6’9″ power forward to -125. To make a $100 on that line, bettors will need to risk $125.</p>
<p>Kawhi Leonard is the second most valuable prize in the summer free agent class. Oddsmakers have the Toronto Raptors – the team he led to its first NBA title – as the frontrunner at -125. Other candidates include the Los Angeles Clippers and Lakers, both at +190, New York Knicks (+3500), Nets (+5000), and Philadelphia 76ers (+7500).</p>
<p>If Leonard somehow decides to go to Philly, bettors who risk just $5 on that happening would net $375.</p>
<p>Irving is a strong favorite for Brooklyn (-550). A $100 bet on that line nets just $18.18 should Kyrie take his talents to New York. The point guard is additionally considering rejoining LeBron in LA (+250), the Knicks (+1100), and staying put in Boston (+2000).</p>
<p>Spending Spree</p>
<p>The 2019 summer will be costly one for NBA owners who want to land one of the sought-after free agents.</p>
<p>As to which team will spend the most, the Nets are the favorite at -300. Landing Durant and Irving would cost the team more than half of a billion dollars over the next four years.</p>
<p>The Knicks are second (+350), and Clippers third (+325).</p>
<p>According to Forbes, the Knicks remain the NBA’s most valuable franchise at an estimated $4 billion. The league average is $1.9 billion. The Lakers are the second most valuable team at $3.7 billion. The Warriors are third at $3.5 billion.</p>
