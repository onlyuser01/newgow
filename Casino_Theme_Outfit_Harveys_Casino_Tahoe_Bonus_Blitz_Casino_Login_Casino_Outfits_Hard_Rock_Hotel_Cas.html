<p>Business-to-business betting content and production services provider Sports Information Services has signed an important partnership with South African sports betting operator Marshalls World of Sport. The partnership will see the launch of a South African 24/7 live betting channel.</p>

<p>He added that numbers betting remains as one of the preferred wagering options to South African players who adore the 49’s brand. The local clients will now be able to enjoy 49’s draws reworked version, alongside a plethora of other gambling offerings.</p>
