<p>Provider of gaming content for the online casino industry ODDSworks announced it has signed an agreement to distribute content produced by Galaxy Gaming Digital.</p>
<p>Bringing Premium Table Games Content</p>
<p>The distribution agreement between ODDSworks and Galaxy Gaming Digital will initially see titles such as Split to Double Blackjack, Roulette Up and Rising Phoenix that feature progressive jackpots utilize ODDSworks’ Betguard Remote Gaming Server (RGS) platform to become available to online casino players in North America.</p>
<p>Commenting on the distribution agreement, ODDSworks chief executive officer Shridhar Joshi outlined that Galaxy Gaming Digital’s content is “in line” with ODDSworks’ growth strategy that seeks to expand the company’s “presence in each domestic market.”</p>
<p>“ODDSworks is pleased to provide world-class, best-of-breed differentiated table games to our casino partners,” Joshi concluded.</p>
<p>ODDSworks president Larry DeMar, who also commented on the deal, hailed Galaxy Gaming Digital as “a great company” and “business partner,” sharing his expectations that this partnership would continue to grow over the coming years.</p>
<p>As a developer of innovative games, bonus systems and technology solutions, Galaxy Gaming Digital brings casino content from US land-based casinos and online casinos in Europe to online casinos in the US and is the world’s leading licensor of proprietary table games to the online gaming industry.</p>
<p>Content produced by the Las Vegas-headquartered game provider saw over 1 billion wagers made worldwide in the last twelve months but this will not be an issue for ODDSworks’ RGS platform as it is well suited to handle huge volumes.</p>
<p>‘Nimble, Quick to Market Execution’</p>
<p>“At Galaxy Gaming, we are enthusiastic about creating the best table games and bringing that content to new channels,” said Todd Craven, president and chief executive officer of Galaxy Gaming Digital, thrilled at the opportunity to launch the provider’s expanding portfolio of digital games with ODDSworks’ “nimble, quick to market execution” leveraging “decades of gaming experience.”</p>
<p>According to ODDSworks’ plans, Galaxy Gaming’s content will initially become available to online casino players in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Michigan, before expanding into other regulated gaming jurisdictions in North America.</p>
<p>Recently, ODDSworks added casino-proven game content from another game developer, Habanero Systems, to its Betguard RGS platform to further expand its game library consisting of proprietary and third-party titles.</p>
<p>In May, ODDSworks partnered with top-ranking social casino gaming company Ruby Seven Studios to expand Ruby’s offering with new premium game titles from its digital game portfolio and help its partner engage with its audience.</p>
