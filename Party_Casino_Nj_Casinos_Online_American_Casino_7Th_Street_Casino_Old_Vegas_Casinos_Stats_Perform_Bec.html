    <h1>Party Casino Nj Casinos Online American Casino 7Th Street Casino Old Vegas Casinos Stats Perform Bec</h1>

<p>Stats Perform’s advanced AI capabilities and state-of-the-art solutions will revolutionize how the SFL presents its games to fans</p>
<p>Stats Perform, a sports data and analytics company, has become the official data partner of two Swedish soccer leagues. As agreed with the Swiss Football League (SFL), the company will form an alliance with the Credit Suisse Super League and the Dieci Challenge League.</p>
<p>The agreement will allow Stats Perform to use official SFL data, enhance fan experiences for fans of the leagues and attract new sponsors. According to the official release, the SFL selected Stats Perform as the data partner for the two leagues in order to bolster fan experiences with “comprehensive, deep, real-time accurate statistics and insights,” instead of basic stats.</p>
<p>As a result, Stats Perform will leverage its Opta soccer API to deliver the depth required by the SFL. The company’s tools will be instrumental in creating compelling coverage of the two leagues’ teams and players.</p>
<p>The Swiss Football League official data rights are a part of Stats Perform’s extensive official data portfolio, which encompasses many European top-flight leagues, such as the EPL, LaLiga, Ligue1, Serie A and the Bundesliga, among others.</p>
<p>The data deal with the SFL follows agreements with other sports organizations, such as the USL in the USA and the Liga FUTVE in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Stats Perform to Delivering High-Quality SFL Experiences</p>
<p>The Swiss Football League’s chief digital officer, Frank Schaffner, said that his team is excited about the partnership with Stats Perform. He praised the latter company’s unrivaled Opta data collection, distribution and innovation-focused approach, saying that the provider’s values perfectly align with the league’s vision.</p>
<p>Schaffner noted that Stats Perform’s advanced AI capabilities and state-of-the-art solutions will revolutionize how the SFL presents its games to fans.</p>
<p>This partnership signifies our commitment to delivering high-quality experiences and memorable storytelling that enriches the on-field action for our fans, media and sponsorship partners. Frank Schaffner, chief digital officer, SFL</p>
<p>Steve Xeller, Stats Perform’s chief revenue officer, also commented on the matter, saying that the provider is happy to become the SFL’s official data provider. He noted that he is very happy that the SFL has opted to adopt his company’s PressBox Graphics.</p>
<p>It is smart Opta-powered tech to enhance social, news media and broadcasts with brilliant graphics before, during and after games, making it easier to attract and retain fan attention, as well as grow sponsorships. Steve Xeller, CRO, Stats Perform</p>
<p>Xeller concluded that his team is committed to helping the SFL elevate the quality of its matches.</p>
<p>The deal with the SFL follows an earlier agreement with the Badminton World Federation.</p>
