    <h1>Blackhawk Casinos Argosy Casino Alton Il Caesars Atlantic City Resort Casino Spokane Tribe Casino Bo</h1>

<p>Sending you questing across the sea to plunder and pillage has not necessarily been up on Real Dealer Studios’ mind – until now. The studio’s Viking-themed roulette game, steeped in Old Norse mythology and lore, has been expertly crafted to offer you a fresh take on the popular table game and elevate the mood of even the most reluctant see voyager among you.</p>
<p>The company’s Hollywood-focused approach to Random Number Generator (RNG) games shows once again, with a touch of the dramatic, Viking adventure, as the company puts it in an official press release.</p>
<p>In Vikings Multifire Roulette players will have the opportunity to discover an exciting gameplay that is thematically apt and tailored to innovate how you experience roulette. There is no missing the theme either, as every little detail of the game is carved out to be specifically fit for the period it wants to portray, from the music to the crackling fire, to a lighthouse where the armory is, and so much more.</p>
<p>The game comes with a hefty multiplier to stir excitement much like Vikings anticipate a successful raid, and bets could be multiplied by 500x. There are a total of five multipliers that are revealed as an animated volley of arrows hits five shields revealing the five lucky numbers, which will have multipliers applied from 45x to the coveted 500x.</p>
<p>Although the lucky number mechanic is already known to players thanks to 9 Masks of Fire Roulette, the new game is just as compelling and entertaining to watch and play. The title will be available exclusively through Games Global.</p>
<p>You may not see popular Hollywood actors in this one, but the visuals have been delighted with the same meticulous craftsmanship as Vikings build their longboats to raid across the seas. No need to don your horned helmet either to play as this is a historic inaccuracy.</p>
<p>Real Dealer Studios has been on a tear of late as well, with the company introducing many interesting titles. A month ago, the company presented its Multi-Hand Blackjack played in the company of Rachael Bower.</p>
