<p>Arizona Cardinals Hoping That Last Weekâ€™s Win Wasnâ€™t a Glitch</p>
<p>The Arizona Cardinals are one of the worst teams in the NFL in 2023. At least thatâ€™s the case at this particular moment. The thing is that the Cardsâ€™ best player â€“ their quarterback Kyler Murray â€“ is injured and will remain sidelined for (at least) another couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The team from the Grand Canyon State does have some decent receivers on the rosters (e.g., Marquise Brown) but they probably wonâ€™t do much until Murray returns. In the meantime, their strongest offensive weapon is going to be their running game.</p>

<p>Arizonaâ€™s running backs did great against the Dallas Cowboys last weekend in Arizona. The Cards won the game 28-16, with Rondale Moore and James Conner each scoring one rushing TD. Their third TD was the work of Marquise Brown on a throw from QB Joshua Dobbs.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s even more impressive is that Arizonaâ€™s defense managed to keep Dak Prescott and the Cowboys offense to just 16 points. Can they do something similar on their trip to San Francisco on Saturday?</p>
<p>The 49ers Determined to Go 4-0</p>
<p>There are just three teams that have all wins in the 2023 NFL, and one of those is San Francisco. The 49ers have been brilliant so far both offensively and defensively. Theyâ€™re averaging 30.00 points per game while conceding just 14.00 on average. This means that both their offense and their defense rank first in the National Football Conference (NFC).</p>
<p>With players like Nick Bosa and Kyle Juszczyk on their defensive team, the Niners have nothing to worry about defending against the Cards. Their offense too should be able to run riot on the team from Arizona. Quarterback Brock Purdy has been pretty decent thus far, but itâ€™s their running back Christian McCaffrey whoâ€™s been the most impressive. Wide receiver Deebo Samuel has also been great, both when it comes to receptions and rushing.</p>
<p>Arizona Cardinals vs. San Francisco 49ers Prediction</p>
<p>San Franciscoâ€™s fans have started dreaming about the Super Bowl and the 49ers will do all they can to keep that dream alive. Theyâ€™re going to demolish the Cardinals on Sunday, possibly scoring way more than their 2023 average. Their defense should do a fine job as well, meaning that the hosts are almost certain to cover the spread in Week 4.</p>
<p>Picks: San Francisco 49rs to win and cover the spread</p>
