<p>After receiving millions in funding from Yolo Investments in April and making its debut on the US market with the help of a New Jersey Service License in May, retention and reactivation specialist Enteractive decided it was time to hit the refresh button on its management team in the US. The company has appointed Faye Williams as its new head of account management for the Business-to-Business team.</p>
<p>Enteractive, Ready for More Growth</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for Williams’ appointment was the company’s intention to keep expanding in the US market. Wanting to harness the incredible potential shown by the market, the pioneers behind the (Re)Activation Cloud technology are ready to connect with even more operators and drive more active players for iGaming brands spread all over the world. This is also the new head of account management’s plan, as expressed in a statement following her appointment. Enteractive is prepared to boost operators’ retention and player loyalty rates with their advanced one-on-one conversation solutions, while maintaining all player data safe, well-protected against vulnerabilities, and fully compliant with GDPR and G4 Responsible Gaming requirements.</p>
<p>The company’s chief business officer Andrew Foster whom Willimas will report to also spoke about the current year and its successes, mentioning Enteractive’s “remarkable growth” obtained with the help of both newcomers joining its roster of clients, as well as thanks to its entrance on new global markets. Foster put special emphasis on the North American market, further acknowledging the importance of Williams’ appointment as the lead of the US B2B crew.</p>
<p>Seven Years of Experience</p>
<p>Foster also called Williams’ experience an “extensive” one in the iGaming industry, further explaining that Enteractive’s decision to appoint her to the important position was a smart call. Williams is expected to help support the company’s business growth in the following years while continuing to build bridges between operators and players.</p>
<p>Before joining Enteractive, Williams spent over a year as WKND’s head of VIP in Malta. Prior to that, she was Gaming Innovation Group’s head of player loyalty and UK and ROW key account manager for two years and three months. At the beginning of 2018, Williams started a three-year VIP relations manager job with Paddy Power Betfair. She was also a regional account manager for DMA UK and an account manager for a food and beverage manufacturing company at the start of her career.</p>
<p>Williams commented on her appointment, expressing excitement for joining the company Enteractive on its path to turn into a world leader in reactivation and retention.</p>
