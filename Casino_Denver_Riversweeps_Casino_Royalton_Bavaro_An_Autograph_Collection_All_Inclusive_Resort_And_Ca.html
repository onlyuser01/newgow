    <h1>Casino Denver Riversweeps Casino Royalton Bavaro An Autograph Collection All Inclusive Resort And Ca</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play, a fast-growing provider of content for the online gambling industry famous for delivering up to eight slot games every month, expanded further its presence in Europe after announcing a new deal. The company said Monday it joined forces with one of the biggest operators in Switzerland, Swiss Casinos.</p>
<p>The new collaboration enabled the operator to gain access to Pragmatic Play's entire portfolio of content which consists of more than 300 games. As a result, Swiss Casinos gains access to multi-award-winning games that are already proven to be popular in the Swiss market such as Gates of Olympus and Sugar Rush. Moreover, the collaboration sees the Swiss operator tap into newly released titles including Cowboy Coins, The Knight King, and many more.</p>
<p>In a statement released on March 20, 2023, Swiss Casinos' Director Online Casino, Patrick Mastai, shared his excitement saying: "Pragmatic Play remains one of the most consistent and unique slot providers in the market." He added: "It makes sense for us to partner with such a leading industry name on our latest venture which will undoubtedly positively impact our growth plans."</p>
<p>Mastai said that the company is excited to expand its offering by bringing in a variety of new games. Finally, he predicted that Pragmatic Play's titles will bring extra excitement to slot fans.</p>
<p>Besides expanding the offering of Swiss Casino, the new collaboration provides a boost for Pragmatic Play in the country and on the Old Continent. In fact, the deal comes on the heels of other agreements inked by the company with major Swiss operators such as Grand Casino Bern and the Partouche Groupe-owned brand Pasino.ch. Thanks to the latest deal, the company now solidifies its presence within the iGaming market in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operations Officer, shared her excitement saying: "Weâ€™re thrilled to welcome Swiss Casinos to our growing operator base after a fast and straightforward integration."</p>
<p>She pointed out that thanks to the new deal, the company's popular games are reaching new audiences. Cornides noted that this, in turn, helps strengthen Pragmatic Play's position in the market. In conclusion, the Chief Operations Officer said: "We look forward to working with the team closely as we continue to build momentum in this key regulated market."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, earlier this month, Pragmatic Play inked a deal with SA Esportes in Brazil. That deal helped expand further the reach of the company's products into one of the most lucrative markets in Latin America.</p>
