<p>Red Tiger, a leading developer of online slot content for casinos, has launched its progressive jackpot games for the first time in New Jersey, United States. This marks the fifth jurisdiction in North America where the company’s products are present, and it’s a significant expansion of the supplier’s operating reach in the important region.</p>
<p>Red Tiger has already been able to set up shop in several prominent jurisdictions, including Connecticut and Michigan in the US, and Ontario and Quebec in Canada. The latest expansion in the Garden State brings around 50 of the company’s prominent games, including Gonzo’s Quest Megaways, Narcos Mexico, Piggy Riches Megaways, and not least Cash Volt and Dynamite Riches.</p>
<p>The company is also confident that more launches will be coming before long, with Pennsylvania and West Virginia to follow soon enough. In New Jersey in particular, Red Tiger’s products are already live with some of the most prominent local brands in the market, including FanDuel, RushStreet Interactive and FanDuel. Red Tiger is also giving operators a lot of flexibility about how they can present these offers to their customers.</p>
<p>Businesses may choose to have Hourly or Daily Jackpots set up or go with a classic jackpot setting that has no limit and drops when it’s won without a limit on how much money can be accumulated as the jackpot before that. Daily and Hourly Jackpot options though tend to have a certain appeal as they promise players to have something to look forward to in the near term and stir excitement with audiences.</p>
<p>Evolution, which is the parent company of Red Tiger, was similarly excited about the prospect of having the supplier’s online slots and jackpot solutions launched in New Jersey. Evolution Chief Commercial Officer for North America Jeff Millar said that jackpots were a big hit with players.</p>
<p>"We’ve been having fantastic feedback from operators in terms of the high performance these games are seeing in states such as Michigan and Connecticut, and so everyone was looking forward to the New Jersey launch," the executive detailed in describing the most recent rollout.</p>
<p>He spoke that timed jackpots are a good way to give players more excitement and confirmed that, as always, the group remained committed to bringing the best and most innovative products possible to the North American market – the timed jackpot solutions were definitely among those.</p>
