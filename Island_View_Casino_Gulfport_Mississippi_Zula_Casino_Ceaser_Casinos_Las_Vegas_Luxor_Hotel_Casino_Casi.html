<p>Bayes Esports, the preeminent specialist in esports data and partner of Riot Games, a video game publisher, has announced two new appointments to help strengthen the company’s management team. The new appointments will be working directly with company CEO Martin Dachselt and COO Amir Mirzaee and they come from outside the esports industry, which is Bayes Esports’ stomping ground today.</p>
<p>The first person to join is Christopher Bohlmann who is taking the reins as Director of Growth &amp; Finance. Bohlmann’s main expertise lies within Technology Investment Banking, a vertical in which he worked during the better part of his ten years with JP Morgan in the United Kingdom and Germany. The man welcomed his appointment as part of Bayes and he said that his career path and past experience led him to his current position, which was a culmination of all his previous efforts.</p>
<p>"The opportunity to be at the forefront of an exciting industry and shape its evolution through the leader in esports data analytics," Bohlmann explained. He is joining alongside André Schneider who will work as Senior Director of People &amp; Culture. Schneider has also worked outside of esports for the most part of his career, and this is his first entry into the sector, which will expose him to a dynamic industry that packs a powerful punch and whose full potential is yet to be realized.</p>
<p>Dachselt was excited at the news of the new announcements arriving. He said that they come at a crucial juncture for the company, as Bayes Esports is currently undertaking further expansion moves in the United States and planning a new odds distribution platform. The addition of those two particular experts, Dachselt said was evidence that the company is clearly capable of pulling in top talent and making sure that it pursues its long-term growth strategies.</p>
<p>Back in June, Riot Games and Bayes Esports announced a new LoL Esports Data Portal, part of the two companies’ extensive and continued collaboration over the years. Esports has been a competitive part of the traditional gambling experience.</p>
<p>As an entertainment phenomenon, esports has been amassing a solid following worldwide, and now, bookmakers are beginning to expand their reach in the segment in the hopes of capitalizing on a youthful demographic with plenty of disposable income. Bayes Esports, though, remains laser-focused on the live data that is the best of its kind, especially when it concerns Riot Games’ titles.</p>
