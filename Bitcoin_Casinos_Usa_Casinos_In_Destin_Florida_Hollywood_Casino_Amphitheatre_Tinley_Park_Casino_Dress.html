<p>Wynn Resorts restored free self-parking at its Strip casinos on May 1. Effective at midnight on Monday, September 30, valet parking will also be complimentary for Wynn and Encore guests, as well as those who simply want to park their cars and walk elsewhere.</p>
<p>Wynn Las Vegas announces free valet parking at Wynn and Encore for all guests, without limitation, and without the need for validation,” a company statement read.</p>
<p>Without validation means one can take advantage of valet service at the Wynn casinos without spending a buck on the resort grounds.</p>
<p>Guests Wynn</p>
<p>Social media was quick to celebrate the move after what’s been a turbulent couple of weeks for the Las Vegas gaming industry. Our recent Casino.org coverage of the ongoing resort, parking, and drink fees has caused quite an uproar online.</p>
<p>The valet parking announcement from Wynn feels like a small win for the community. “Hopefully, this starts a trend back to normality,” one Twitter user commented to Vital Vegas.</p>
<p>Another said, “There is a straw that breaks the camel’s back. Paid valet parking to me was that. There’s something about pulling up to a hotel, giving your car to a valet, that makes you feel like a million bucks even if you don’t have a million bucks.”</p>
<p>Free parking had been an amenity afforded to Las Vegas guests of all tier levels for decades. That changed in the summer of 2016 when MGM Resorts – the company that owns more Strip casinos than any other – ended the perk. Caesars Entertainment soon followed, as did Wynn Resorts.</p>
<p>But Wynn’s two casinos, located on the northern end of the Strip, remained surrounded by casinos that didn’t jump on the parking bandwagon. Treasure Island, Sands’ Venetian and Palazzo, and Fashion Show all continued offering free parking.</p>
<p>“Free valet parking is an amenity that is highly appreciated by our guests, and we are pleased to offer it to all of our visitors,” Wynn Resorts President Marilyn Spiegel added. “We take pride in providing guests with five-star service at Wynn and that begins upon arrival at the resort.”</p>
<p>Start of Something Good?</p>
<p>Las Vegas locals and tourists will be hoping Wynn Resorts’ decision to bring back free valet parking is only the beginning of a reversal of policies that are seemingly pinching pennies from customers.</p>
<p>The latest outrage came after guests reported incurring mandatory service charges on their cocktails at Park MGM and the new Sahara. MGM Resorts said the add-on fee is a “venue fee” that keeps the place operational and covers such things as resort Wi-Fi and bar top gaming maintenance.</p>
<p>One frequent Sin City guest told Casino.org, “This is why we are going to Vegas less and less and to local Indian casinos and hotels instead. The resort fees are just ridiculous. If you don’t use the gym and pool, then you shouldn’t have to pay for it.”</p>
