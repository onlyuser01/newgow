<p>AffPapa has announced a new batch of limited seats for its upcoming iGaming Club London event, due to take place on Wednesday, February 8. The new seats are added to the already existing 200-seat capacity, as AffPapa has enjoyed strong demand for the upcoming industry meeting, reuniting some of the biggest names in gambling.</p>
<p>The event itself is designed to bring together B2B companies, operators, and affiliates and allow them to exchange know-how, ideas, and generally strike fresh partnerships and business pursuits. There have already been more than 500 registrations for the event, with the ongoing demand for more a testament to AffPapa’s success with this particular format.</p>
<p>AffPapa Head of Commercials Yeva Avagyan welcomed the opportunity and said that she was excited to release the additional seats for the gathering. She added:</p>
<p>"It really is a testament to the event’s popularity. More than 200 representatives from various companies under one roof – that’s what we call quality networking!"</p>
<p>The event will reunite a number of prominent brands, AffPapa informed in a press release shared with Casino Guru News. Among the attendees are prominent names such as AskGamblers, Sofascore, Soft2Bet, Raketech, Entain, Campeón Affiliates, Betsson Group, and others.</p>
<p>All attendees will enjoy an excellent dinner and reception at De Vere Grand Connaught Rooms in London on February 8. The event will host a "speed dating" format meant to break the ice between companies and individuals who do not know each other and help them quickly establish new connections.</p>
<p>AffPapa recently entered into a strategic alliance with SBC, a prominent media and events company in the industry. The two companies hope to benefit from their mutual expertise and reach new audiences, bringing value along the way. iGaming Club London is expected to be the biggest hosted by AffPapa to date, and certainly – not the last.</p>
