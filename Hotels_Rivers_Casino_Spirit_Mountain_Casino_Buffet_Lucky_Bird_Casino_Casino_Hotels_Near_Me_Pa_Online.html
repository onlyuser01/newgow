<p>The ICE London 2023 is now open for registration as this year’s event will be looking to raise the bar for the global gaming industry under the ‘Stronger Together’ theme.</p>
<p>Fantastic Opportunity to Re-Connect</p>
<p>The event labeled as “three days of unrivalled product discovery” is scheduled to take place at ExCel London February 7-9 and will mark the return of the gaming industry’s major supplier brands as organizers expect the event to become the biggest on record.</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming’s managing director Stuart Hunter expressed his expectations that ICE23 will raise the bar for the global gaming industry, hailing “the prospect of a full-scale ICE London … [as] a fantastic opportunity for world gaming to re-connect and take advantage of the unparalleled business opportunities the show delivers.”</p>
<p>He then mentioned the recently held at The Venetian Convention and Expo Center in Las Vegas international gaming trade show Global Gaming Expo (G2E) 2022, outlining the optimism and energy demonstrated there and hoping to see the same dynamic brought to the “international community of 35,000+ gaming pioneers” when they gather in London to gain “access to the latest innovations, technology solutions and expert insights,” hailing ICE23 as the “world’s most comprehensive gaming expo.”</p>
<p>Access to Gaming Innovations Is Paramount</p>
<p>“The quantitative and qualitative research that we’ve undertaken with our stakeholders confirms how much importance the ICE community places on having access to the latest gaming innovations,” he continued, confident that ICE will once again live to its name and ensure its visitors receive “the very best opportunity of the year to gather ideas, meet the right people and make the right connections over three days of unrivalled product discovery.”</p>
<p>Hunter then stated that the team at Clarion Gaming “can’t wait to welcome the entire global industry” back to London to “what promises to be one of the most memorable and unmissable ICE events” in its history, hoping the event will set the tone for an exciting 2023 for the gaming industry.</p>
<p>“We look forward to seeing the industry get off the fantastic new Elizabeth Line trains and arrive at ExCeL London ready to connect,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Last year, the fate of ICE London was decided in a vote by the members of the Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers (AGEM) as there were concerns that the event could be postponed due to the waning interest from major industry suppliers such as Merkur Gaming, Quixant, Novomatic, Zitro, R Franco Group, and others.</p>
<p>The event also needed a last-minute effort by the Association of Event Organisers (AEO) in the UK to reassure the gaming industry that ICE London 2022 is safe and will take place as planned.</p>
