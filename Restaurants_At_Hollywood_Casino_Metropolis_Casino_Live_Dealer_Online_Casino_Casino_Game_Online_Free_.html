<p>Sportradar, a business-to-business multinational sports data and technology provider, is bringing some fresh blood to its leadership by acquiring the experienced business executive Andrew Bimson as its new chief operating officer for North America.</p>
<p>Bimson Becomes the New COO of Sportradar</p>
<p>Bimson joins Sportradar as the company seeks to scale up its advertisement business, its sports and entertainment offerings, and its betting and gaming solutions. The newly-appointed COO will be tasked with coordinating this expansion and guiding the company forward.</p>
<p>Bimson has two decades of experience in positions of leadership and responsibility. His CV begins in 1995 when he started working as regional director of Operations Asia Pacific for Planet Hollywood International.</p>
<p>In 1998 he moved to become the chief executive of Carlson Marketing. In 2002 he joined Maritz as a group director of business development and marketing where he remained for seven years. In 2009, Bimson founded Tangible Marketing Solutions and a year later joined Chime Group as its global head of client services and licensing.</p>
<p>Bimson’s latest experience was in the financial, software, data, and media company Bloomberg. He began his time there as a regional team leader for the Americas in 2012 but after less than two years rose to become Bloomberg Marketing’s global head of business operations and analytics. His overall experience in the realm of marketing will be a valuable asset for Sportradar’s envisioned expansion.</p>
<p>Sportradar’s CEO Is Excited to See Bimson Work With the US Teams</p>
<p>Bimson spoke on his new role and praised Sportradar as a leading company that is located on the intersection of sports, data, and technology. He said that he is delighted to be joining the firm and is delighted by the opportunity of leading its talented teams. Bimson is thrilled about the prospects of taking a part in Sportradar’s efforts in revolutionizing the sports betting and entertainment industry in the United States. Arne Rees, the chief executive officer of Sportradar North America, welcomed Bimson to the company:</p>
<p>“Andrew joins Sportradar at an important time as the North American market is primed for significant growth and remains a key focus of Sportradar’s overall strategic plan. His role in partnering with our leaders to articulate this vision, align teams around it, and create meaningful KPIs to measure our progress will be critically important.” Sportradar CEO for NA Arne Rees</p>
<p>Rees said that he can’t wait for Sportradar’s talented US teams and Bimson to start working together and inspiring each other. Bimson isn’t the only new recent addition to Sportradar’s leadership. The company recently appointed Jim Brown as its head of integrity services.</p>
