<p>The 2020 NFL Draft is expected to be the most wagered-on drafting event in the history of sports. That is the result of a number of factors, but primarily the temporary suspension of all non-essential gatherings and sports betting markets. As such, the betting markets to wager on for the virtual NFL draft have been bursting at the seams with dozens of various prop markets.</p>
<p>Today, we will cover the 2020 NFL Draft odds, start dates and times, TV channels and how to watch live. The event had to originally take place in Las Vegas, Nevada, but NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL management has moved it online due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>All players will be at home during the virtual draft with the 58 top prospects tuning in with live cameras so that the audience can see their reactions when their names are announced.</p>
<p>When Does the 2020 NFL Draft Start?</p>
<p>Date : Thursday, April 23</p>
<p>: Thursday, April 23 Time: 8:00 – 11:30 p.m. ET</p>
<p>The NFL Draft 2020 starts today, Thursday, April 23, and runs through April 25. Drafting will take three days to decide most of the format for next season while the NFL is hoping to return on time for the 2020/2021 season.</p>
<p>The drafting will begin at 8:00 p.m. with NFL and EA Sport having crafted virtual 2020 draft moments to help circumnavigate the ban on non-essential gatherings and still hold what is generally considered the most important event in the pre-season.</p>
<p>As the NFL works on a virtual draft experience for prospects, 2 interesting notes:</p>
<p>— EA Sports will create a virtual moment of the prospect walking out on stage meeting the Commissioner.</p>
<p>— Each prospect will choose a HS to receive a $2,500 grant towards their football program. — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) April 3, 2020</p>
<p>Where Can You Watch the NFL Draft Live?</p>
