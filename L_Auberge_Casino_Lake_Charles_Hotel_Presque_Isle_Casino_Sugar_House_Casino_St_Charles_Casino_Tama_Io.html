<p>Globally recognized provider of content for the iGaming vertical Pragmatic Play announced a new collaboration, expanding its footprint in Latin America. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it signed a deal with Win Prêmios, a Brazilian gambling operator. Thanks to the new collaboration, the Brazilian operator will expand its offering and presence within the market.</p>
<p>The new deal will see Win Prêmios integrate leading content from Pragmatic Play, including Live Casino, Virtual Sports and Slots products. Per the partnership, the content will be integrated into Win Prêmios' platform, boosting its offering and delivering fan-favorite and engaging content from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>In a statement released on April 11, 2023, a representative for Win Prêmios commented: "Having Pragmatic Play's range of incredible games at our disposal is hugely important for us to maintain our competitive edge in a keenly contested market." Finally, the representative explained: "The award-winning games we will have are crucial in retaining the players we already have and attracting the all-important new customers."</p>
<p>Victor Arias, Pragmatic Play's Vice President of Latin American Operations, added: "Win Prêmios is another leading brand that we're delighted to partner with." Finally, he explained: "The strength of our multi-vertical offering has been key in almost all of our recent commercial agreements and this one continues that positive trend."</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal with Pragmatic Play, Win Prêmios will benefit from recently released slot hits such as Wild Wild Bananas and Mammoth Gold Megaways. Customers of the operator would also be able to tap into Sugar Rush, Gates of Olympus and other multi-award-winning titles from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The new deal covers Live Casino titles, which means that customers of the Brazilian operator will also be able to access Roulette, Blackjack and Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, among other leading titles. Last but not least, clients of the operator will be able to experience Force 1, Greyhound and Horse Racing and other Virtual Sports games from Pragmatic Play thanks to the new collaboration.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Win Prêmios further strengthens Pragmatic Play's already established strong presence in Brazil. Additionally, the new deal complements the company's growth within the Latin American region. It comes after Pragmatic Play joined forces with SA Esportes, again for the market in Brazil early last month.</p>
<p>More recently, the company expanded its European footprint via a deal with Swiss Casinos, a leading operator in Switzerland. The deal saw Pragmatic Play deliver its portfolio of content for customers of the operator, expanding the reach of its titles to new audiences.</p>
