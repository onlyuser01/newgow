<p>Kaizen Gaming is a great fit for the championship, according to UEFA’s director of marketing</p>
<p>Betano has been named as the first-ever betting partner for the UEFA European Championship, the primary soccer tournament in Europe. This deal will cement Betano’s presence in the region while making it the first betting firm the UEFA has partnered with for an international tournament.</p>
<p>The current deal follows Betano’s success as a partner of the FIFA 2022 World Cup and will see its parent company, Kaizen Gaming, serve as the official global sponsor of UEFA’s upcoming tournament in Germany.</p>
<p>For reference, Betano was FIFA’s first-ever sports betting partner for a World Cup event as well, attesting to its bullishness of remaining ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Next year’s UEFA tournament is set to run from June 14 to July 14 and take place across 10 cities in Germany. It will welcome a number of big soccer teams from countries such as England, France and Spain, among others. Greece, Kaizen Gaming’s home country, is yet to qualify but hopes to do so through the play-offs.</p>
<p>Betano Is a Great Fit for UEFA Euro 2024</p>
<p>Kaizen Gaming’s chief executive officer, George Daskalakis, commented on the development, saying that his team is thrilled to be partnering with UEFA for next year’s Euro 2024 tournament. He added that this unprecedented collaboration expresses Kaizen Gaming’s “fundamental passion for soccer” and the company’s commitment to innovation and excellence.</p>
<p>Kaizen promised to provide cutting-edge betting markets during the event, bringing fans closer to the game in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
<p>We are very excited to be part of this football celebration and are looking forward to enhancing the overall fan experience by delivering unparalleled entertainment through responsible gaming during this highly anticipated European Championship. George Daskalakis, CEO, Kaizen Gaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guy-Laurent Epstein, UEFA’s director of marketing, said that his team is delighted to welcome Kaizen Gaming and its Betano brand as an official partner of the upcoming UEFA Euro 2024. Epstein praised Betano as an exceptional company and a “great fit” for the tournament.</p>
<p>Betano is a leading digital sports betting operator, with a focus on cutting-edge technology and responsible gaming. We believe their industry expertise and affinity to football make them a great fit for the tournament. Guy-Laurent Epstein, director of marketing, UEFA</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Betano also sponsored Ekaterina Stratieva during Rally Bulgaria 2023.</p>
