<p>The Detroit Pistons and WynnBET have announced a new collaboration designed to boost fan engagement and drive marketing efforts for both companies.</p>
<p>WynnBET to Host Special Wednesday Experiences for Detroit Pistons Fans</p>
<p>WynnBET has struck a marketing partnership with the Detroit Pistons, establishing yet another high-profile deal with a sports franchise, following a similar deal in Tennessee. The companies have agreed on a multi-year collaboration which will see their brands pushing together to bolster marketing efforts across numerous channels.</p>
<p>Detroit Pistons will benefit from WynnBET’s footprint in the gambling market, finding new ways to engage with audiences who are either committed or leisurely sports bettors. Wynn will run its unique “Wynn Wednesdays” campaign designed to boost the experience further and available exclusively on the company’s dedicated WynnBET mobile app and website service.</p>
<p>Wynn will allow players to win a variety of prizes, including tickets, player memorabilia, and VIP experiences with each Wednesday contest. WynnBET will further bring in-arena solutions, tapping Wynn Resorts for its VIP clientele expertise.</p>
<p>There will be pop-up experiences and in-suite hospitality, all run by the hospitality company and its sports betting arm. The companies will also look into more traditional forms of marketing, bringing advertising efforts together across numerous channels, including social media, radio programs, and on-site at physical locations.</p>
<p>Responding to Demand for Personalized Betting Products</p>
<p>The Pistons make a nice addition to WynnBET’s growing lineup of sports partnerships. Similarly, the company has recently invested in collaboration with the Memphis Grizzlies, and the company became the Authorized Gaming Operator of NASCAR, and not least, the Official Online Sportsbook of the Martinsville Speedway and Richmond Raceway, ahead of a licensing deal in Virginia.</p>
<p>WynnBET is well-represented in multiple states across the country, including New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, and Colorado. The company has brought a slick mobile app solution that enables sports bettors to engage with the activity and place intuitive wagers on the go.</p>
<p>By reaching out to sports franchises, WynnBET is creating a tailored product to cater to a growing demand for personalized betting experiences.</p>
