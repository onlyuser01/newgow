<p>Carolyn Renzin, former FanDuel chief risk and compliance officer , announced on her LinkedIn profile that she would become the company’s new chief legal and compliance officer starting this month. This promotion continues her almost three-year employment at the gambling operator.</p>
<p>Renzin Has Substantial Legal Experience in Many Industries</p>
<p>FanDuel was Renzin’s first contact with the gambling industry. After graduating in 1995 from Wesleyan University with a Bachelor’s Degree in English, she studied for two more years at the University of Michigan Law School and received a JD in Law. Renzin then worked with leading law firms Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP and Stillman &amp; Friedman. There, she specialized in litigation and regulatory defense.</p>
<p>From 2011 to 2013, Renzin got involved with compliance consulting and internal investigations at Guidepost Solutions, a consulting company focusing on compliance, monitoring, and security. Her most high-profile job was with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., where she spent over six years. Renzin started as an executive director, owing to her significant experience. She initially worked on government investigations and regulatory enforcement and quickly rose through the ranks. After two years at the financial institution, she moved to the chief operating office of the legal department and later became assistant general counsel.</p>
<p>The New Position Comes with New Responsibilities</p>
<p>Renzin first started work for FanDuel in 2019 as a legal, regulatory, and compliance VP and later became chief risk and compliance officer. In her newest position as chief legal and compliance officer, she will replace Christian Genetski, who got promoted to president.</p>
<p>“Gigantic shoes to fill and no greater team to continue working with!” Carolyn Renzin, chief legal and compliance officer at FanDuel</p>
<p>In taking over Genetski’s duties, Renzin will focus on overcoming legal challenges and working with US government bodies and regulators. She will continue to work towards legalizing and regulating fantasy sports in more US states and will maintain the company’s portfolio of high-profile partnerships with high-profile leagues and professional sports franchises.</p>
<p>Genetski has moved on to manage FanDuel’s corporate strategy, business development, and government relations. He will also head the company’s strategic partnerships and stimulate growth through new business initiatives. Renzin promises to be a worthy successor to his previous position, as she has proven capable of adapting her vast legal experience to varied roles and challenges.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s sportsbook products are currently available in 15 states. The operator recently launched its online live dealer games in Pennsylvania to positive acclaim. The company currently holds 40% of Pennsylvania’s sports betting market and is doubling down on its iGaming offerings. According to FanDuel, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many clients to gravitate toward the operator’s online offerings. The company hopes to turn some of its sports bettors into online casino players and attract new players who are apprehensive about visiting a physical venue.</p>
