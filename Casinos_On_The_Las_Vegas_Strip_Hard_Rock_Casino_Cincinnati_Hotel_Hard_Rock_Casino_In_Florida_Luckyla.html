    <h1>Casinos On The Las Vegas Strip Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati Hotel Hard Rock Casino In Florida Luckyla</h1>

<p>I started playing as a new player and used the first deposit bonus.</p>
<p>After using it off I played and won 800e. I made a withdrawal request.</p>
<p>I made the next deposit and played. I made a 100e withdrawal request.</p>
<p>Well then the account verification process started and I even did it twice, a very slow and miraculously accurate confirmation: even the selfie had to be sent.</p>
<p>Then a strange action began; I asked about my withdrawals from the live chat and there was nothing known about them; was asked but to confirm the account (I had already done so!). I emailed customer support and asked for withdrawals and account confirmations. I suddenly got the answer that my account has been closed for the time being under someone's Article 9.7, meaning the casino doesn't have to justify it at all. Any balance and pending withdrawals will be processed ... but nothing happened.</p>
<p>The casino live chat is unaware and support has been closed for the time being.</p>
<p>The grounds would have been nice to receive and information about the withdrawal request ..</p>
