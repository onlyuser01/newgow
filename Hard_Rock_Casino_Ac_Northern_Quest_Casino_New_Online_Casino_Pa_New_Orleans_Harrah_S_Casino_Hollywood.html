<p>Geolocation and technology company Xpoint continued to expand its footprint across North America after an agreement with sports betting and media company Rivalry.</p>
<p>Ensuring Geolocation Compliance in Ontario</p>
<p>Toronto-based operator offering fully regulated online wagering on esports and sports, as well as casino games, Rivalry, announced it has appointed Xpoint as its provider of geolocation technology services to ensure regulatory compliance for its operations aimed at the next generation of bettors.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Rivalry’s chief technology officer Ryan White outlined that the decision to appoint Xpoint as the operator’s supplier of geolocation services “was the natural choice” for the business.</p>
<p>“Their technology plays a key role in our ability to trade safely and securely, and we see the relationship with Xpoint as a true partnership,” White continued, highlighting Xpoint’s credentials that make them a great partner such as its high efficiency and ability to provide value.</p>
<p>Geolocation technology services provided by Xpoint under the partnership will ensure that all customer transactions at Rivalry are compliant with the active regulations in the gaming market in Ontario, the Canadian province which launched online wagering on sports in April 2022.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to be working with Rivalry as they make such rapid progress growing their business and their brand in Canada,” said Marvin Sanderson, chief executive officer of Xpoint, outlining the strengths of the wagering operator.</p>
<p>“Rivalry’s strong focus on esports, and its young demographic, makes the company a serious force in one of the most important markets in North America, so to be part of their team is a real honor for Xpoint,” Sanderson said.</p>
<p>North American Expansion Continues</p>
<p>The appointment as a geolocation technology services provider of the Canadian brand came shortly after Xpoint celebrated its first year of operation after the tech supplier was formally introduced to the industry in Las Vegas in October 2021.</p>
<p>In just over a year, Xpoint managed to launch its services with multiple partners in North America, its headcount expanded to over 65 and the company is one of only two licensed geolocation technology service providers in New Jersey, the other being GeoComply.</p>
<p>Xpoint’s competitor GeoComply initiated legal action in the Delaware District Court against its smaller rival in September claiming infringement of patent rights and asking the court for injunctive relief to prevent Xpoint from further infringements and protect its investment-based risk but Xpoint came out with a short statement that patent infringement allegations have no merit.</p>
