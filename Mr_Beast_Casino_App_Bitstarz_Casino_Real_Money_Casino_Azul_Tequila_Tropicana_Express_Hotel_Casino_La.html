<p>Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) has reported a year-on-year revenue rise of 39% for the first half of the 2021 financial year.</p>
<p>The online casino saw its H1 revenue for the first six months of the year up until 30 June rise to $58.4m, up from the $42.2m recorded a year prior. Gaming revenue came in at $51.1m, representing a 38% increase from 2020. The operator’s net income was $68.1m, up from $4.3m a year previously, however the company operated at a loss of $12.8m for H1.</p>
<p>GNOG’s EBITDA was reported at a loss of $7.4m, down from $14.4m made last year, which the operator attributed to investments in markets such as Michigan.</p>
<p>In terms of Q2, revenue was up 28% to $31.7m with net loss of $1.6m, compared with a net income of $0.1m for the same period last year. Gaming revenue was up to $28m from $22m, while adjusted EBITDA was down from $8.5m last year to a negative of $3.8m for Q2 2020.</p>
<p>The operator’s number of active first-time depositors grew by 110% for Q2 and 313% for H1.</p>
<p>GNOG’s Chairman and CEO Tilman Fertitta said: "We are proud to have achieved another solid quarter driven by the strength of our new customer growth both in our established and newer markets."</p>
<p>"GNOG continues to successfully execute on our national expansion, while concurrently strengthening our capabilities and product offerings with key partnerships."</p>
<p>"We are increasingly encouraged by our results and look forward to executing on the significant and growing market opportunity available to us."</p>
<p>GNOG also announced that it has signed a partnership with online gaming provider Boom Entertainment, which will allow the operator to offer a greater amount of content through bespoke casino games.</p>
<p>The revenue rise comes just over a week since it was announced that DraftKings will acquire GNOG in an all-stock purchase with an equity value of $1.56bn. The fantasy sports and sports betting operator will use the Golden Nugget brand, online product experience and a database of more than five million users.</p>
<p>That deal comes around 14 months since GNOG became the second publicly traded online casino company in the US, after Landcadia II entered into a purchase agreement to acquire it. The deal, which saw GNOG go public on the Nasdaq exchange in December, valued the company at approximately $745m.</p>
