<p>The 2023 MLS brings us a lot of excitement on Saturday, June 17, with six interesting matches on the program that day</p>
<p>Nashville SC vs. St Louis City is one of the most exciting duels of the next round of the 2023 MLS. It‚Äôs because both teams are incredibly good in the attacking department. St Louis City is the highest-scoring team in the league right now, while Nashville‚Äôs striker Hany Mukhtar is the current MLS Golden Boot holder.</p>

<p>Nashville‚Äôs Talisman Hany Mukhtar Ready for Another Big Performance</p>
<p>Hany Mukhtar won the MLS Golden Boot last year after scoring 23 goals in 33 games. This year, he‚Äôs one of the top favorites to win the award again. Right now, he‚Äôs got 10 goals to his name, after playing 17 MLS matches in 2023.</p>
<p>However, in the 2023 season, the German striker isn‚Äôt just about scoring. He‚Äôs about recording assists as well. So far, he‚Äôs made seven of them, which puts him in third-shared place on the list of top assist-makers in the league.</p>

<p>His offensive output has helped Nashville SC get to the No. 2 place in the Eastern Conference. When it comes to the defense, these guys have been working as a collective. Although none of Nashville‚Äôs defenders is a superstar player, they‚Äôve done a marvellous job at keeping their net safe in 2023.</p>
<p>The proof of this is that Nashville has conceded just 12 goals thus far, which is fewer than any other team in the entire league. Unfortunately for Gary Smith‚Äôs men, their opponent on June 17 is the highest-scoring team in the 2023 MLS.</p>
<p>St Louis City Ready to Start Scoring a Lot Again</p>
<p>With 33 goals in 16 games, this is the highest-scoring team in the MLS in 2023. That accounts for 2.06 goals per game on average. However, the brand-new MLS franchise has scored just one goal in the last two rounds.</p>
<p>As a result, Bradley Carnell‚Äôs men were unable to get a win in the last two games, which is why there‚Äôs no danger they might drop out from the No. 1 spot in the Western Conference table. To prevent that, they need to start scoring more.</p>
<p>The good news for them is that they definitely have the manpower to find the net at least once on June 17. Their No. 9 Joao Klauss remains injured, but his teammates from St Louis‚Äôs offensive department seem to have upped their form lately. For instance, forward Nicholas Gioacchini scored three goals in the last five games and playmaker Eduard Lowen did the same.</p>
<p>Nashville vs. St Louis Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be one very interesting match. The hosts are favored for a reason, but we doubt Nashville‚Äôs defenders will have an easy job against St Louis. In fact, if they want to win, the home boys will have to attack with all they‚Äôve got. As a result, we should see plenty of goals on both ends, with Mukhtar &amp; Co. being the ones to score at least one more than the opposition.</p>
<p>Pick: Nashville SC to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
