<p>Soft2Bet, which already runs B2C operations in the country, said that Sweden is a key market for its business</p>
<p>Soft2Bet, an operator group and platform provider, is set to expand its presence in the Nordics after securing a B2B license from the Swedish Gambling Authority. This is a huge development for the company as it will be able to provide proprietary solutions to its B2C businesses in the country.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new permit, Soft2Bet will be able to arm its local casino and betting websites, namely Betinia, Yoyo Casino and CampoBet, with content. The permit from the Swedish regulator is valid between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2028, allowing the company to freely offer its B2B products in the country.</p>
<p>The development, Soft2Bet said, paves the way for new partnerships with locally-operating companies. It will also mean increased value for existing Soft2Bet partners.</p>
<p>Starting July 1, online gaming companies in Sweden will be able to onboard Soft2Bet’s content, securing access to a rich portfolio of more than 4,000 casino titles. Soft2Bet’s impressive library consists of games from over 60 top providers and is designed to offer a diverse choice of content, allowing operators to appeal to various demographics.</p>
<p>Sweden Is a Key Market for Soft2Bet</p>
<p>The launch in Sweden is expected to be beneficial for Soft2Bet, its B2C brands and other local operators. The company’s Betinia brand, which is the latest one to hit the Swedish market, will likely benefit the most from this launch. Betinia is a gamified casino and sportsbook operator that continues to quickly gain popularity in Sweden.</p>
<p>David Yatom, Soft2Bet’s general counsel, commented on the matter, saying that Sweden has been a core market for the company for “quite some time now.” He added that his team is pleased that Soft2Bet will now be able to run both its B2B and B2C businesses in the country.</p>
<p>This is a terrific achievement for the company which will be followed by many others. David Yatom, general counsel, Soft2Bet</p>
<p>Speaking of Yatom, the general counsel joined Soft2Bet this March, bringing years of experience to the team. Yatom was tasked with leading the company’s legal, regulatory and compliance teams, helping it remain compliant while expanding its business.</p>
<p>Back then, Yatom said that he strongly believes in Soft2Bet’s products and expressed his delight in joining the company.</p>
<p>In February, on the other hand, Soft2Bet onboarded content from Octoplay, diversifying its proprietary aggregation platform. The latter company supplied Soft2Bet with five of its titles, namely Pearly Shores, Heavy Anchor, Hot Harvest, Disco Dive, and Blazing Touch.</p>
