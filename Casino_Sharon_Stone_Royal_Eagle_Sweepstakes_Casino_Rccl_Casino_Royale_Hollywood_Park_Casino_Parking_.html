    <h1>Casino Sharon Stone Royal Eagle Sweepstakes Casino Rccl Casino Royale Hollywood Park Casino Parking</h1>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru .</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>As for your claims about not knowing about the maximum bet amount or that something is unfair - in your previous post, you mentioned that in other casinos, the maximum bet amount is enforced by the system. It indicates that you were aware of it because, if I am not wrong, it was not mentioned anywhere until you mentioned it. Moreover, the rules for this specific bonus (the link was shared by the casino above) are still public and fully available on the casino website ("Promotions" section). They are still there and easy to find. To be honest, rather it is unfair toward the casino to breach the casino's rules (likely consciously), and then even submit a complaint and wait for the casino to pay out such an amount.</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information and evidence, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's bonus terms and conditions - the maximum bet amount while playing with a bonus was exceeded, which gave you an unfair advantage (significant winnings won by one of these bets). Your disputed funds represent winnings earned in a prohibited way. In addition, you even lost all those winnings, so no funds from those winnings were left in your account. Therefore, there is basically nothing to be disputed at all. However, even if you complied with all the casino's bonus rules, you would be able to withdraw only the maximum cashout amount of 500 BRL.</p>
<p>Alright, kaueamaral. Let's not drag it unnecessarily out and close the matter.</p>
