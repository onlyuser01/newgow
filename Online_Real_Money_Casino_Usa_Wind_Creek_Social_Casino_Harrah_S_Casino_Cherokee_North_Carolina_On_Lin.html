<p>Today we bring you 20 time-tested Vegas gambling tips to steer your next trip to The Strip in a way that benefits you emotionally and, perhaps, financially. Our tips are the result of personal experience, friendly advice, and the occasional lucky break.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do Not Play Airport Slots</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing that will grab your eyes at the McCarran airport is the slot machines tucked away all over the place. They are a good reminder that you have arrived in Las Vegas and gambling awaits. Yet, one of our first Vegas gambling tips has to do with asking you to avoid these.</p>
<p>While a quick gateway to a bit of gaming fun, you will soon realize, or perhaps not soon enough, that the slots pay slightly worse. The house edge is well below the 95% average for most casino floors in Las Vegas, making for not too worthwhile a session.</p>
<p>So, honestly, if you have come to play Vegas slots, just hold on a little longer and head down to the casino floor after you have checked in at your hotel!</p>
<ol>
<li>Low Limit Blackjack, Too Good to Be True</li>
</ol>
<p>Some players come and prefer to play on a budget. The reasoning is sound. If you have just a bit of money to spend on gambling, why not find a low-limit blackjack table and bet $5 or $10 at hand, as opposed to anything heftier than that?</p>
<p>Well, there is at least one reason we have found out. As it turns out, low-limit blackjack tables have a natural blackjack payout of 6:5 instead of 3:2. Evidently, you want to head for tables where the payout is 3:2 as it will guarantee a slightly better payout.</p>
<p>Now, from what we have seen in the years in Las Vegas, casinos do clearly mark the tables that pay at 6:5, which means it’s easy to spot those out and avoid them if you choose to. Some players who don’t mind taking on the extra risk and just enjoy the chase can still sit at a 6:5 table, but the payout is expected to be much poorer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Moderate Your Gaming Sessions</li>
</ol>
<p>The more time you spend at a casino, the more the house wins. This disheartening truth is often reiterated by gamblers who have been playing at casinos for years now. Our next Vegas gambling tip recommends that you always approach gaming in the city with a moderation of sorts.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean not having a good time or fretting over what time it is and whether you should leave. It’s just a friendly reminder that for better or for worse, the house has that pesky inherent advantage.</p>
<p>Sometimes, quitting while you are ahead is truly the smart thing to do, providing you with the leeway to come back and play more at no high cost to your bankroll. Staying smart about your gaming is a worthwhile way to enjoy Las Vegas and its many casinos.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go for European or French Roulette</li>
</ol>
<p>American Roulette is widely popular in Las Vegas, and this is no surprise. After all, it’s the homebrewed version of the popular French game. Yet, European and French Roulette tend to be so much more rewarding, and if you do happen to find these versions on the casino floor, please go ahead and stick with them.</p>
<p>The reason why lies in the simple fact that, unlike American roulette, these versions have only 37 pockets instead of 38 and a single zero, which reduces the house edge a little further! In fact, French Roulette may come with the En Prison or/and En Partage rule, which further offsets the house edge and gives you access to a few clever and rewarding mechanics.</p>
<ol>
<li>Video Poker Takes Time to Find</li>
</ol>
<p>Video poker is one of the most ambitious games you can take on in Las Vegas, and our Vegas gambling tips compilation would not be quite the same about paying attention to one of the theoretically most-rewarding titles.</p>
<p>Yet, video poker has a few tripwires to mention as well. For example, you ought to be careful about the payout tables. Some video poker games pay well above 99%, but others may drop to under 95%. It’s always best to check what the expected theoretical return is before you commit.</p>
<p>Of course, the highest-paying games may be taken, or there may not be too many of those, but either way, you can do your due diligence and makes sure you are playing the best games there are.</p>
<p>If you see yourself as a more competitive-minded player, you will probably find your place at the poker tables. They are designed to host players who prefer to let skill take over the chance. Yet, do not think that because Texas Hold ’em poker relies on a lot of skill that applies to all other games, you will find in a casino.</p>
<p>In fact, poker is the exception, and most other games are designed to let luck determine whether an outcome is successful or not. Overall, poker is one of the most played games on the casino floor, and this really shouldn’t come as a surprise!</p>
<ol>
<li>No, Don’t Accept Too Many Drinks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Free alcohol in Las Vegas is often the case, or if not free, then very, very cheap! Buying shots and a good brew for $2 a glass is definitely a bargain. Yet, as you drink, your inhibitions will usually start diminishing, and that’s something you want to prevent.</p>
<p>Watch out for the intoxicating effect of alcohol and the carefree attitude that its sweet taste often bestows on the imbiber. Instead, remind yourself that, just like anything else, you ought to take your drinking in moderation.</p>
<p>Naturally, you may have a slightly higher alcohol tolerance than other people, but this is something for you and you alone to decide. Just try not to blink in and out of consciousness only to find yourself short of several hundred chips!</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a Banking Limit</li>
</ol>
<p>We did mention moderation, didn’t we? Well, setting a bankroll to use for your gambling conquests is definitely smart. Of course, some players may object that implementing restrictions to your gaming session before you have even started is definitely not what you have come to Las Vegas for but listen.</p>
<p>The best way to have fun is to use your money smartly, and even win a little more, perhaps! There are many upsides to setting a budget. You will always be in control of your gaming spending and definitely feel better when you leave.</p>
<p>If you think that a bankroll limit is restricting, here’s another top-notch Las Vegas gambling tip for you – save up a little more and set the budget higher! There is no need to travel to Vegas if you feel the funds you have earmarked for that are not sufficient for a decent session.</p>
<p>And remember, it’s all about moderation!</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a Strategy</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling is definitely more linked to chance than it is to any measurable skill and, apart from poker and perhaps video poker, it is very little you can do to influence the outcome of any gambling product.</p>
<p>However, we still like to think that there are some mathematical constants that you can use to influence slightly better payouts. The good thing about gambling strategies is that they usually work across a range of games, including:</p>
<p>Blackjack</p>
<p>Baccarat</p>
<p>Roulette</p>
<p>Sic Bo</p>
<p>Craps</p>
<p>Popular choices of strategies here include Martingale, Fibonacci, D’Alembert, and other curious stratagems with even more curious names.</p>
<p>Most of these are just mathematical algorithms that you need to stick to and repeat time and over again to gain an advantage, or at the very least, minimize risk while getting a slight payout.</p>
<p>Even strategies are prone to the occasional mishap that could be costly if you get too complacent!</p>
<ol>
<li>Card Counting Has Its Downsides</li>
</ol>
<p>Card counting is one of the strategies out there that truly works. After all, the (in)famous MIT blackjack team managed to win millions from casinos, traveling the world and spreading the secrets of impeccable maths.</p>
<p>Yet, card counting, while not illegal, is prohibited on the casino floor. Of course, a casino cannot bring a criminal case against you, but they can ban you and notify others that you are counting cards!</p>
<p>Counting cards will definitely help you get a bit of a head-start, but the thing is, it may take you months to master the practice, and even then, the slightest distraction could upset the entire sequence.</p>
<p>It’s fun, but do remember that you are not living in a Hollywood flick!</p>
<ol>
<li>New Games Are Tripwires</li>
</ol>
<p>Las Vegas casinos love to keep well-stocked with new and exciting games for you to try. Yet, it’s a good reminder to us all that new games are not always tested. Even an exciting new game can turn out to be a bit of a money drain, and this is alright so long as you are aware and happy to pay the price for the content you get.</p>
<p>However, if you look for slightly more generous titles, we recommend keeping a distance from new games or, at the very least, doing a bit of due diligence so you may verify their authenticity and that they are worthwhile picks after all.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Chips Is Money</li>
</ol>
<p>One clever way casinos have come up with almost making you forget that you are burning through your money is to take the money out of the equation. While the chips used at the casino certainly add a delicate elegance to the experience, they also serve as a way to disassociate money from value.</p>
<p>Chips are shiny, fun to play with, and a bit treacherous. After all, you are not betting money, right – just chips. However, each chip has a monetary value, the value that you can immediately cash out at the cage. As long as you remind yourself that every chip on the casino floor has actual real money use, you are off to a good start!</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a Casino to Suit Your Needs</li>
</ol>
<p>The next Vegas gambling tip we have prepared for you has to do with you personally. What casino are you looking for? Are you keen to join the big action at VIP private rooms, or are you more of a budget player looking for a fun gaming session and fair payout tables?</p>
<p>Some casinos will offer table limits at $1/$2 up to $5, and while this probably reminds you of the “blackjack trap,” this is not always the case. In fact, casino properties don’t mind offering both fair payouts as well as flexible table limits.</p>
<p>When talking about a casino that suits your needs, though, we could mean many things. Just because certain table limits are there, this doesn’t mean you would be excited about the rest of the offer.</p>
<p>It’s important to strike a balance, and often, researching a property at places such as Trip Advisor can be a great help.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t Get Miffed, it’s Just a Game!</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no reason why you should get frustrated with your gaming session. It’s important to approach the activity with the right mindset. Once you realize that gambling is not a way of making money but a way to pass the time with the added excitement of winning some extra cash, you will be on the right path.</p>
<p>If you do start getting upset at the casino, this could be the beginning of a world of troubles you don’t want to sour your visit to Las Vegas! Take it from us, and you don’t want to kick up a fuss at a table or get into a fight with the dealers.</p>
<p>Casinos have no tolerance for patrons assaulting or abusing anyone on the casino floor, and decorum must be kept. Ask yourself if gambling is the right activity for you if you are easily peeved by the outcome of chance events, and if not, you don’t have to spend too much time in casinos or any at all!</p>
<ol>
<li>Casinos Never Lie</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason why casinos don’t like disrespectful patrons, other than for appearances, lies in the fact that they never lie. Put this way, and a casino will never rig the games or try to lead you down a treacherous path.</p>
<p>Other than the drinks sent your way and the glitz and glamor of those venues, all casinos are subject to stringent regulatory norms that they uphold without failure. And, to put it a little cynically, casinos have zero incentive to cheat.</p>
<p>They already have a statistical advantage that keeps their businesses winning and staff paid. It would be silly to gamble this away for a chance to squeeze some illicit practice. And, while casinos are suppliers of gambling products, they never gamble with their bottom line.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t Get Caught Up in the Excitement</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you just arrived for a seven-day stay in Las Vegas? Great, you have a full week of Excitement ahead of you, but to make good full use of the time, you will have to check a few things first. For starters, you do not want to end up like one of those stories about tourists who came, spent all their money, and had to sit out the rest of their trip!</p>
<p>One of the best Vegas gambling tips we can give you right now is to not get caught up in the Excitement. Sure, there will be so many things to do, but it’s important to also draft up a plan and spend your funds in a way that will bring you the most fun, too.</p>
<ol>
<li>Progressive Jackpots Are about Luck of the Draw</li>
</ol>
<p>Progressive jackpots are some of the games that get the most attention. Their multi-million payouts often make headlines and invite players to follow in the footsteps of fellow players who have come, seen, and won a seven-figure lump sum.</p>
<p>Yet, as you can’t always tell if your lottery ticket is a winner so you can’t expect progressive jackpots to drop. In fact, it’s important to remind yourself that these slot machines are based on pure chance alone! Of course, you may be tempted to give them a closer look.</p>
<p>Remember to stick to your budget and not go all-in on a game that may or may not reward you in the end!</p>
<ol>
<li>Play for the Right Reasons</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a popular Las Vegas gambling tip, and it’s particularly true. When you visit a casino, you ought to be playing for the right reasons, and that is having fun. While the jackpot numbers will keep ticking away seductively, there is no shred of evidence that you can be a winner.</p>
<p>It all boils to pure, blind luck that is unfortunately quite tempestuous and not easily tamed. In fact, you cannot tame luck, and no amount of rituals or good luck charms will help you tilt the odds in your favor – anything beyond the statistical probability that they already hold.</p>
<p>Speaking of superstitions, this brings us to our next piece of advice.</p>
<ol>
<li>Superstitions Do Not Work</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s okay to be a bit superstitious when gambling, too. In fact, all gamblers are a little hopeful for a miracle to happen. So, whether you cross your fingers or blow on your dice before throwing it in, or clasp your hands in prayer, there are many rituals you can engage in.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s important to remind yourself that all of these are more for your peace of mind than they are for actually influencing the turnout of a roll, a card dealt, or spin of the roulette wheel. Of course, having such private rituals to turn to will not only add fun to your Excitement but also help you relax a bit and enjoy yourself more!</p>
<ol>
<li>Do Not Try to Make up for Losses</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are keen to have a good time in Vegas, heed our advice and stay out of any emotional and rash decisions. Some players often fall victim to the common pitfall that is chasing one’s losses.</p>
<p>The idea that you can make up for a loss is rooted in the misinterpretation that gambling is a means to make money. It’s not, and you should only bring and bet the money you are prepared to lose so that you can focus on the experience itself.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Gambling Winnings Are Taxable</li>
</ol>
<p>Too many players who have never been to Las Vegas before, the fact that you have to fill out tax forms at casinos may come as a bit of a shock. Yet, depending on how much you win, you will have to let the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) know.</p>
<p>We have described at some length what happens if you choose not to. For the most part, you will get a few amicable letters kindly reminding you over the years, but sooner or later, the day of reckoning will come, and you want to leave Las Vegas a winner or at least a happy patron, and not liable to government regulation!</p>
<p>The Best Las Vegas Tips Are Those That Work for You</p>
<p>The list of our 20 Las Vegas gambling tips is here to help you figure out what you want from your next trip. Along with revealing a few Vegas-specific things to watch out for or even embrace, you have hopefully found some common gambling wisdom to stick to.</p>
