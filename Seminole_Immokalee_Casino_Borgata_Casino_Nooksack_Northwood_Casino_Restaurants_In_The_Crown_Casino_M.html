<p>At a time when most businesses are looking to shift online, citing lower costs of operation and higher revenue inflow, Authentic Brands Group is bucking the trend. Never mind who divests from the Las Vegas Strip, the owner of Sports Illustrated is committed to launching a resorts brand named after the leading sports magazine in the United States.</p>
<p>The Sports Illustrated Resorts concept has been broached by Authentic, seeking to collaborate with Experiential Ventures Hospitality and ADMI to make it a reality. Sports Illustrated has become a torchbearer in sports reporting, providing sports news, scores, data, and insights, and it may now lend its name to a land-based resort that is set to make an entry in 2022 and probably in the Dominican Republic based on present reports.</p>
<p>Great Things Expected from Sports Illustrated Resorts</p>
<p>The rumors have been confirmed in an official press release provided by Sports Illustrated Resorts on Friday and the announcement was celebrated at The Party, which was the company’s signature festive event for Super Bowl LVI. This year, the event took place on Saturday at Century Park in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The first property will be coming to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic at some point in 2022. The region has been strategically selected as it is one of the best resort development areas in the Western Hemisphere. The upcoming resort will have access to numerous activities, including golf, scuba diving, horseback riding, water sports, biking, hiking, and more.</p>
<p>There are plans to also build an interactive hotel and resort in Orland as Sports Illustrated Resorts will seek to become a household name in the hospitality industry as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Interactive Experiences for Consumers and Travelers</p>
<p>It all comes down to Sports Illustrated’s mission, said ADMI chairman Joseph Cellura who argued the company seeks to provide a vibrant and interactive experience. Experiential Ventures Hospitality CEO Christopher Schroeder pitched in a similar note:</p>
<p>“People are looking for experiences that allow them to be more active and participatory, and Sports Illustrated Resorts will create the ultimate immersive experiences for guests through the various hospitality categories and destinations we plan to enter.” Ventures Hospitality CEO Christopher Schroeder</p>
<p>The resorts are designed to come with numerous entertainment options, including live-action sports, quality dining, wellness, and relaxation experiences. ABG executive vice-chairman Dan Dienst added that the Sports Illustrated brand was excited to engage with travelers and families in what he dubbed as an “immersive lifestyle.”</p>
<p>Those properties will “become go-to destinations for individuals and families seeking active vacation experiences,” Dienst concluded.</p>
