    <h1>Grand Fortune Casino Casino Royale James Bond Westgate Resort Casino Vivaro Casino Bitcoin Casino Us</h1>

<p>I opened a account on the casino , submitted documents and were approved - so all good , account verified .</p>
<p>Now I deposited Euro 500 and started playing and successfully reached to Euro 3602 , problem starts here - I tried to withdrawl and it was rejected .</p>
<p>I did just played "sports" and nothing else on the website</p>
<p>I did talk to customer care and been told thata intentionally done by Financial Department as they suspect that I may have used prohibited software and this is under investigation and my account can be used but limited functionality till 21st December ?</p>
<p>I am definitely sure I have NOT used or intented to use anything illegal/prohibited software/means but how can someone manipulate the sports outcome by software - say soccer match between USA and England how can someone manipulate what will happen by software ?</p>
<p>anyway - coming back to the point - I am happy for any investigation since I have NOT done anything wrong - can the casino speed the process - withdrawal blocked till 21st December looks too illogical ?</p>
<p>Please can you talk to casino ?</p>
<p>Please keep my name and personal details as blurred.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
