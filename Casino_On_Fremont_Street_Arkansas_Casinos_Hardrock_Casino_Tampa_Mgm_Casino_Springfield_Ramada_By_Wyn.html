    <h1>Casino On Fremont Street Arkansas Casinos Hardrock Casino Tampa Mgm Casino Springfield Ramada By Wyn</h1>

<p>Dear Petronela,</p>
<p>Yes its 100% sure I had no bonus involved in this case. The balance euro 7.550 was built up from a pure cash deposit and no bonus involved what so ever.</p>
<p>Its also extremely strange and probably just a way to confuce players because they write above 16:3 in their general rules, but under theirs bonus terms they write below:</p>
<p>"Irregular play" may include, inter alia: Placing bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the deposit ( or Bonus, Cash, VIP points, Free Spins) on other games than Slot Machines.</p>
<p>So that means in that case that you are allowed to place bets over 30% of deposit on slot machines like I played if using bonus, but not if using pure cash deposit. The rules are in this case more favourable if you play with bonus money, compere to cash deposit.</p>
<p>I can also add that I am pretty sure that this bet was placed there from theirs side and nothing I did infact.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for this. Nr 1 is that I did 500 spins on same slot with same value euro 6, then suddenly in the middle of all these spins there is one single made spin with a higher value then the allowed 30%.</p>
<p>There are no reason what so ever that I would make on high not allowed spin in the middle of all this.</p>
<p>Nr 2 is that I can see in my history that this overbet spin is made within exact same second as the spin before it and that it take minimum one second between all other spins. Its then impossible to stop the spinning, change bet and then make a new spin again, all in one and same second.</p>
<p>But I understand its close to impossible to try to proof that they have fabricated one spin just to have a reason to cancel my full balance, so I didnt even go that way.</p>
<p>Instead I try to claim that they have no right to cancel the full balance before that made face spin have been made, and perticarly not when I played with cash deposit only.</p>
<p>I have all evidences needed of course, but that will probably not help when we dealing with such a criminal casino.</p>
<p>Kind regards/ Jan K<strong><em>*</em></strong>****</p>
