<p>A freshly signed collaboration between the duo will see Jackpot Aggregator power three customized jackpot campaigns for Kings' Curacao and MGA brands</p>
<p>The leading provider of innovative technology powering the iGaming sector, SOFTSWISS, announced details regarding a new partnership with Kings Media LTD, the parent company of the popular King Billy Casino. Under the terms of the new collaboration, announced Thursday, the company agreed to power King Media with its Jackpot Aggregator which will introduce three customized and unique jackpot campaigns.</p>
<p>The new campaigns involve King Billy’s MGA and Curacao casino brands. Ultimately, the collaboration seeks to elevate the thrill and excitement for the casino’s players. At the same time, Jackpot Aggregator is expected to impact positively Kings’ revenues and boost retention and loyalty.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator is renowned for its scalable campaigns and expertise. The first online operator that tapped into the innovative solution was Cleopatra Group which powered six of its online casino brands. Since then, the interest in Jackpot Aggregator within the iGaming sector has only been growing, allowing SOFTSWISS’ leading technology to reach new partners and customers across the globe.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Jackpot Aggregator will deliver three unique prize levels that include Crown Jackpot, Shield Jackpot and Sword Jackpot. Players of King Billy Casino will have a chance for daily jackpots within the operator’s complete portfolio of more than 7,000 games. Still, it’s important to mention that the company’s MGA and Curacao brands will offer different jackpot totals.</p>
<p>Recently, SOFTSWISS joined forces with the leading provider of games for the online gambling industry, BF Games. Under the terms of the deal, announced late last month, the iGaming developer agreed to provide its portfolio of games, strengthening SOFTSWISS’ Game Aggregator.</p>
<p>The Partnership Marks an Exciting Moment for the Duo</p>
<p>Andrii Morozov, Kings Media’s head of product, acknowledged the importance of the company’s new “Royal Jackpots” feature. He explained that powered by SOFTSWISS technology, the new jackpot system will deliver unrivaled entertainment for the company’s customers. Finally, Morozov said: “All of us at King Billy are excited to be a part of this!”</p>
<p>Aliaksei Douhin, the head of SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator, was similarly delighted about the new collaboration with Kings Media. He explained that Jackpot Aggregator is powered by innovation and proven to boost player engagement.</p>
<p>At the same time, according to Douhin, the solution delivers unique online gambling experiences. Finally, he confirmed that SOFTSWISS will support the whole process related to the delivery of the much-anticipated jackpot campaigns.</p>
