<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no global self-exclusion initiatives applicable for casinos licensed in Curacao.</p>
<p>As far as Curacao casinos, you can't count that you will be blocked in other casinos. For self-exclusion to be active you need to request it first.</p>
<p>OASIS is a self-exclusion scheme mandatory for casinos under German license only.</p>
<p>If your account in Gama casino is still open, I would recommend you request a self-exclusion in the casino as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, clearly state the reason for deactivating your account and specify the time period. Also, the email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as the casino support receives many requests per day. If it is marked visibly you will stand a better chance of having your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (permanently).</p>
<p>The reason for my decision is xxx (gambling problems).</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and that the self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send an email to support@gama.casino (you can CC me at tomas@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
