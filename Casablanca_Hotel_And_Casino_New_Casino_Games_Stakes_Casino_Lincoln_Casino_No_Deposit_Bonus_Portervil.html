<p>Bally’s Atlantic City Hotel &amp; Casino in New Jersey saw the partnership between Bally’s Corporation and FanDuel come to fruition last week as both partners held the grand opening of the FanDuel Sportsbook inside the property Friday.</p>
<p>“We are privileged to partner with Bally’s Corporation to open our FanDuel Sportsbook inside Bally’s Atlantic City.” Andrew Kleiman, Senior Director, Operations, FanDuel Group</p>
<p>In Time for the Basketball Frenzy</p>
<p>Bally’s and the daily fantasy and sports betting brand owned by Flutter Entertainment initially announced they would set up a temporary physical sportsbook inside the casino and by the end of the year, the facility was up and running to mark the second physical sports betting operation for FanDuel in the Garden State and 16th in the US.</p>
<p>“The new FanDuel Sportsbook at Bally’s AC is the fifth retail sportsbook we have opened in the last couple years.” George Papanier, President and CEO, Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>The FanDuel Sportsbook located close to the Northern boardwalk casino entrance of the property greeted its first customers just in time for the upcoming college basketball frenzy in March.</p>
<p>“The legacy of Atlantic City and excitement of being steps away from the boardwalk creates a unique atmosphere for our customers. We look forward to a successful future with our new partner and community.” Andrew Kleiman, Senior Director, Operations, FanDuel Group</p>
<p>Unique Experience</p>
<p>The venue features a composition of 3 video walls: one 20-foot central with two 10-foot on both of its sides, complemented by 10 video displays so that nothing from the sports action can be missed.</p>
<p>Bettors have at their disposal 5 betting windows as well as 20 self-serve sports betting kiosks that utilize the IGT PlaySport platform and proprietary risk and trading from FanDuel to accept wagers on all major US sports, including football, basketball, baseball, soccer, golf, tennis, mixed martial arts (MMA), motorsports and others.</p>
<p>“We now operate sportsbooks in Rhode Island, Colorado, Delaware, Mississippi, and New Jersey – we are thrilled to be in this market and to give our guests an incredible sportsbook experience, right off the boardwalk and our gaming floor.” George Papanier, President and CEO, Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>Sports fans can also enjoy the curated food and beverage menu at the FanDuel Sportsbook, featuring a wide range of pub-style fare as well as a selection of local and craft beer and some specialty cocktails.</p>
<p>Flutter-owned FanDuel and Bally’s Corporation began their partnership in May last year when they launched online and mobile sports betting operations in Colorado, seeking to pair Bally’s experience as casino operator with FanDuel’s sports betting expertise and market position.</p>
