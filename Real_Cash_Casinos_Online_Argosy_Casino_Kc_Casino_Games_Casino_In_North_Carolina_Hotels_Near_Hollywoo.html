<p>Talon S. Jones, 31, of Fernley, Nev., was arrested on Saturday on a warrant charging him with murder and robbery, according to the Elko Daily Free Press.</p>
<p>The victim was identified as Gordon Garcia. He died from multiple blunt force injuries during a February 17 assault, according to an autopsy conducted by a local coroner’s office. The autopsy revealed that Garcia suffered bruises on his abdomen, ears, neck, and shoulders.</p>
<p>Garcia’s father, who was staying at the same casino, got worried after he could not get a response from his son. Casino security guard then checked on Gordon Garcia, who was found unresponsive. EMTs were notified but couldn’t revive him.</p>
<p>When police searched the room, they only found two $1 bills. The father had given Garcia $100 earlier that day. Authorities concluded the money was robbed.</p>
<p>Police then reviewed the casino’s surveillance video, which showed Jones leaving Garcia’s room about 90 minutes after he and Garcia entered it together.</p>
<p>Jones was placed in the Elko County Jail following his arrest, and his case was given to local prosecutors.</p>
<p>Prior Arrests</p>
<p>Police checked Jones’ background and discovered he’d been arrested some 20 times over the prior decade, the Free Press reported.</p>
<p>In 2019, he was charged in connection with buying, possessing, or receiving stolen property. He was also charged on three counts of battery on a protected person, attempting to destroy the property of another, petty theft, and disturbing the peace.</p>
<p>Last year, Jones pleaded guilty to battery of an officer or protected person. On Aug. 30, 2022, he was sentenced to 270 days in jail.</p>
<p>In 2015, Jones was arrested for possession of methamphetamine (meth). Also, that year, Jones was arrested for burglary of a woman’s truck at a casino in Elko. In 2014, Jones was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Bartender Allegedly Steals $10K</p>
<p>A Pennsylvania man stole some $10K since December from Rivers Casino Pittsburgh, authorities said. Owen Kiggans, 51, of Monaca, Penn., allegedly stole $4,450 from his cash register over 24 days ending on July 10. Authorities said he was seen on surveillance video stealing the money.</p>
<p>When speaking with police, he admitted he had a gambling problem, according to Pittsburgh TV station WPXI.</p>
<p>He was charged with theft and is scheduled to appear in court later this month.</p>
<p>Casino Robbery Suspects Arraigned</p>
<p>Two men who allegedly robbed the C.O.D. Casino in Minden, Nev., on Friday, appeared in court this week. Both will be given a court-appointed attorney.</p>
<p>One of the accused also allegedly shot at a deputy. He was not injured, but an undetermined number of bullets struck a patrol vehicle. Andrew Toomey, 43, of Carson City, Nev., and Chase Henderson, 33, of Minden, both were found near the crime scene.</p>
<p>Each was charged with robbery with a deadly weapon. Henderson was also charged with attempted homicide of an officer and battery on an officer.</p>
<p>Henderson’s bail was set at $2.5 million. Toomey’s bail was set at $1 million, and both men remain in custody.</p>
