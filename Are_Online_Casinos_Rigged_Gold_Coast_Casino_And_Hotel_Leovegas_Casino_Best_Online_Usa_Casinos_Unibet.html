    <h1>Are Online Casinos Rigged Gold Coast Casino And Hotel Leovegas Casino Best Online Usa Casinos Unibet</h1>

<p>Bragg Gaming Group has been moving fast in the regulated iGaming market in New Jersey, United States. After confirming a launch with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino last week, the acclaimed supplier of iGaming content and tech is back with a new collaboration with Resorts Digital, and its clients - ResortsCasino.com and MoheganSunCasino.com - both prominent and trusted brands in the Garden State.</p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, the company confirmed that Bragg Gaming Group is deploying its Remote Game Serve with Resorts Digital Gaming in the state. This way, Bragg’s new proprietary content will be readily available to more interested parties in what the company considers to be one of the largest regulated iGaming markets in North America.</p>
<p>The move also further strengthens Bragg Gaming Group’s position in the fast-developing North American market. Even though iGaming has been slower than sports betting, there has been a considerable momentum for the vertical. Thanks to this partnership, the company’s content is now available to both aforementioned operators.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group Chief Operating Officer and PresidentLara Falzon was very pleased with the development. Falzon argued that this new rollout was a significant achievement for the company and it clearly demonstrated its the strong reception that its innovative proprietary content enjoyed with a growing audience of online players in the entirety of the North American market.</p>
<p>"We expect the ongoing rollout of our new content and RGS technology throughout North America will enable us to reach new audiences with quality content that we believe will continue to significantly boost our growth within the iGaming market," Falzon detailed.</p>
<p>She was similarly happy to see Resort Digital Gaming taking so readily to the opportunity to introduce Bragg Gaming Group’s content with their players at the two operators, to wit ResortsCasino and MoheganSunCasino. Falzon argued that the games by Bragg Gaming Group would contribute to the addition of new players.</p>
<p>Resorts Digital Gaming CEO Ed Andrewes welcomed this new opportunity, and noted that his company too was interested in expanding its platform with the best content possible to offer back to customers in New Jersey. Previously, Bragg Gaming Group teamed up with DraftKings in the Garden State.</p>
<p>In December, Bragg Gaming Group confirmed that it has reached a content distribution partnership with BetMGM in Michigan, another prominent regulated iGaming state in the US.</p>
