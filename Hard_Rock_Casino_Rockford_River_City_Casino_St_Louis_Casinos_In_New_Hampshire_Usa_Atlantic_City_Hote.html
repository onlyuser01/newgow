<p>Club America vs. St. Louis City looks like one of the most interesting duels of the second round of the 2023 Leagues Cup</p>
<p>St. Louis City lost to Columbus Crew in the first round, meaning that only a win on Tuesday can save the team from Missouri. The trouble is that the Missourians are taking on Mexico’s most valuable team, Club America.</p>
<p>This is going to be the first League Cup game for “Las Aquilas” who are coming off a 3-0 win over Puebla in Liga MX some 10 days ago.</p>

<p>Club America Has Big Plans for the Leagues Cup</p>
<p>Club America is the most decorated Mexican side, as well as the most expensive Liga MX team in 2023. This makes “Las Aguilas” one of the top favorites to win the Leagues Cup. But to get there, they need to do well in the group stage first.</p>
<p>The game with St. Louis City is going to be their first game in this competition, and such matches are always tricky. This goes especially because the game is played in the United States, and the team from the Mexican capital hasn’t been great on the road.</p>
<p>Actually, they’ve played only one game on the road in the 2023-24 Liga MX. It happened in the opening round of the season (on the last day of July), and they lost to underdog Juarez. Still, there’s a caveat. That was the time when the CONCACAF Gold Cup was still on, and some of Club America’s key men were away with Mexico – the national team that ended up winning the trophy.</p>
<p>St. Louis City to Go All-In</p>
<p>St. Louis City has no other option but to go for a win on Thursday. If this team loses again, it’s all over for them. But can the Missourians beat Club America? Well, the good news is that the game is played on their turf.</p>
<p>CITIPARK in St. Louis is the place where this team is 8-1-3 in the 2023 MLS, which is better than any other team in the Western Conference. Further, St. Louis City is 7-1-2 in the last 10 home matches in all competitions.</p>
<p>What’s got to worry coach Bradley Carnell is that his boys didn’t impress in their first game of the Leagues Cup. They lost to Columbus Crew 2-1, in a game that was completely dominated by the boys from Ohio. In fact, St. Louis City’s only goal wasn’t the work of their players but an own goal by one of Columbus Crew’s men.</p>
<p>Club America vs. St. Louis City Prediction</p>
<p>We think this is where St. Louis City’s League Cup journey ends. Club America is just way better than this team, so anything other than a win for the Mexican team would be a huge shock.</p>
<p>Pick: Club America to win</p>
