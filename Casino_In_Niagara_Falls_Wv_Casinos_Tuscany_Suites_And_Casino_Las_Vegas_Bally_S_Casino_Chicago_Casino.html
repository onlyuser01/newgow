<p>Online gambling operator Pinnacle has signed a payment partnership with online payment solution provider CashtoCode. Following the deal, Pinnacle will provide its customers with a new safe and reliable paying alternative – CashtoCode’s eVouchers.</p>
<p>CasthoCode’s eVouchers as an Easy Solution for Multi-Region Operators</p>
<p>CashtoCode’s eVoucher is a means to pay without needing a credit card. It’s described as “a safe, instant payment alternative that helps users to maximize their online security by minimizing exposure of sensitive personal or financial information.” It works in a similar fashion to online gift vouchers, allowing users to make immediate deposits by entering the voucher code. EVouchers can be purchased online and then redeemed on Pinnacle’s platform.</p>
<p>CashtoCode envisions the eVoucher as a “seamless and secure payment experience” that has the potential of greatly benefiting the online gambling industry. It offers an easy solution for operators who wish to expand into new regions.</p>
<p>CashtoCode’s chief executive officer, Jens Bader, is excited to have the opportunity to show the eVoucher’s potential on the global market. Bader reassures that the eVoucher is a great solution for operators as it will allow them to “go live in multiple, distinct regions at the same time, all with a single solution.”</p>
<p>Bader added that the eVoucher is just as appealing to customers as it offers them an instant, reliable, and secure deposit solution that is user-friendly.</p>
<p>Pinnacle – Open to Innovation</p>
<p>The reliability of the eVoucher, along with the various payment regulations across different regions, is what attracted Pinnacle to sign the deal.</p>
<p>Pinnacle’s global head of payment solutions, Isabelle Delisle, spoke about Pinnacle’s openness to innovation by reminding that her company was one of the first-ever to trust in the potential of esports.</p>
<p>Delisle confirmed that the operator places its trust in revolutionary technology as a means to “maintain its position across different markets and demographics.” Delisle said that Pinnacles believes to have found a perfect partner with a similar point of view in CashtoCode.</p>
<p>“We want to give our players more choice, and we believe that they will appreciate the ability to make payments instantly online via a simple eVoucher code – a customer journey familiar to millions around the world,” Delisle explained.</p>
<p>Just as the head of payment solutions pointed out, Pinnacle is indeed an operator that doesn’t shy from pioneering new tech solutions. In April, Pinnacle collaborated with Gamban to provide people who want to take a break from gambling, are prone to addiction, or just don’t want to see gambling sites with an easy solution that blocks all wagering sites on their device.</p>
