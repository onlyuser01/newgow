<p>Crystal Catcher review</p>
<p>Crystal Catcher is a mining and crystal-themed slot from Push Gaming. The central theme is based on beetles that appear down a mine on the hunt for crystals. There is very little in the way of story here, with the slot letting its gameplay do the talking.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Mining-themed slots are popular among developers, with mines themselves creating a fantastic backdrop for the reels. Push Gaming has followed the lead of others with Crystal Catcher, with the mine shaft illuminated by Davy Lamp playing host to the borderless reels. The game shifts settings slightly for the bonus rounds, with hot lava filling up the mine and upping the intensity of the game.</p>
<p>A calming soundtrack fills the air as you spin the reels, with the crystals creating a clanking sound as they hit the grid.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Crystal Catcher is a cluster-pay slot game. The action takes place on an enhanced 7x7 grid, with winning clusters consisting of five or more matching symbols. Like many cluster-pay slots, the game also uses a cascading-wins style mechanic. Whenever you land a win, the cluster is removed from the grid, and more symbols fall from above. This continues to happen until there are no winning clusters left.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Anyone who has taken the Push Gaming slot Fire Hopper for a spin will recognise the bonus features in Crystal Catcher.</p>
<p>The game has two Wild symbols, a Golden Beetle Wild and a standard Beetle Wild. Both of these substitute for other symbols to create winning combinations. These Wilds become more important for the Crystal Catcher feature.</p>
<p>Crystal symbols can land on any spin and, on their own, have no value. However, when a Crystal symbol lands at the same time as the Beetle Wild, the Beetle leaps across the reels. The Wild Beetle multiplier increases by one, and it leaves behind a Golden Wild in position. The multipliers of these increase each time the Beetle jumps. This can lead to some highly volatile game-action, with the cascading feature playing its part nicely.</p>
<p>It’s not just Crystal symbols the beetles will leap to catch. If a bonus symbol lands at the same time, it will leap over and trigger the Free Spins round. Seven free spins are rewarded, and the Wild Beetle symbol becomes sticky on the reels.</p>
<p>There are also instant-prize symbols that can be worth up to x500 that the Beetles will fly over to grab. These will be instantly rewarded.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The maximum win available in Crystal Catcher is 10,000x the player’s stake, which is a solid amount. The RTP is 94.3% or 96.3%, so just make sure you double check which version you are playing, as one is considerably lower than the industry average and is best avoided. The slot is considered highly volatile.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Crystal Catcher is basically a reskin of the Fire Hopper slot from Push Gaming. The good news, however, is that Fire Hopper was a great slot game, making Crystal Catcher a slot that is well worth a spin. The Crystal Catcher feature combines well with cascading wins to create highly volatile gameplay with great winning potential.</p>
