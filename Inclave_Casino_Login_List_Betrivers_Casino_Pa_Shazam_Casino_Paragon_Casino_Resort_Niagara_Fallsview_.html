<p>Stakelogic, an end-to-end software factory where each element of a gaming title is developed, has agreed to power Soft2Bet, a premium provider of casino and sports betting, with its portfolio of slots and live casino games.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet to Integrate Stakelogic’s Suite of Games</p>
<p>As per the deal, Soft2Bet will receive access to Stakelogic’s exciting gambling titles. The latter will be integrated into Soft2Bet’s platform which currently includes many games from some of the best developers in the sector. By teaming up with the provider, Stakelogic joins the likes of Betinia and Yoyo Casino, which are both Soft2Bet partners.</p>
<p>Stakelogic is known best for its state-of-the-art slot titles. However, the company recently joined the live casino sector and is quickly making a breakthrough. The list of the company’s partners currently includes companies such as Unibet, BetCity, Relax Gaming and Kansino, among others. The developer’s live offer currently includes famous games such as roulette variants, blackjack and TV show-styled wheel games.</p>
<p>Stakelogic may be fairly new to the live casino sector but is already establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its cutting-edge studio, the developer delivers high-quality live casino experiences to its partners.</p>
<p>A Convenient Partnership</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s sales executive, Danila Dzehs, said that Soft2Bet represents the perfect integration partner for her company. He praised the provider for being a firm that pairs an unparalleled platform with a network of best-in-class brands that target many regulated markets globally. Dzehs said that he is sure the agreement with Soft2Bet will help both companies expand their footprint.</p>
<p>We’re confident this partnership will further expand our player reach and will lead directly to tremendous success for both Stakelogic and Soft2Bet. Danila Dzehs, sales exec, Stakelogic</p>
<p>Soft2Bet’s director of gaming, Daniel Mitton, also shared his thoughts on the deal. He said that his company is delighted by the opportunity to work with Stakelogic and integrate the developer’s game into its platform. Mitton added that he is excited to launch Stakelogic’s “fantastic titles” across all of Soft2Bet’s brands.</p>
<p>Stakelogic is widely recognized and respected in the industry due to its exciting product offering, while its new live casino range delivered through Stakelogic Live is truly breath-taking. We can’t wait to see where this partnership goes as both our companies continue to expand in regulated markets.” Daniel Mitton, director of gaming, Soft2Bet</p>
<p>A week ago, Soft2Bet welcomed another developer to its platform. Evoplay inked a mutually-beneficial deal that will help it expand in many markets certified under the Malta Gaming Authority. A day later, Boris Chaikin, Soft2Bet’s chief executive, announced his departure from the company.</p>
