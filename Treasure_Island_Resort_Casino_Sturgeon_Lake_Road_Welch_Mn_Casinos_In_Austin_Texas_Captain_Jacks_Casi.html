Finally, he said: "With nearly 20 years of experience at Hard Rock alone, we have the utmost confidence that Elena will continue to elevate the Hard Rock and Seminole Gaming brands in new and exciting ways."</p>
<p>In her role as SVP of Marketing and Brand Partnerships, Alvarez will report to Hook.
