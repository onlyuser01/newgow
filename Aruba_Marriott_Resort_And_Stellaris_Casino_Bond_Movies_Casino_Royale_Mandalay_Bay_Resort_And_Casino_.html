<p>BetDEX, a Web3 sports betting exchange founded by an ex-FanDuel CEO, has expanded its content offering. As announced by the exchange, Indian Premier League markets will now be available to its player.</p>
<p>The decentralized exchange currently offers betting products for many popular leagues, such as American football and basketball. While the platform is still young, its leaders are ambitious and keen on expanding BetDEX further and adding more sports.</p>
<p>The addition of the Indian Premier League to its offerings will see BetDEX make a foray into cricket betting. Considering the league’s popularity, the move will likely channel more players toward the decentralized sports betting exchange.</p>
<p>Cricket betting went live today, as announced by BetDEX on Twitter. The company noted that the first IPL game is still a few days away but interest in the betting markets has already started.</p>
<p>Varun Sudhakar, BetDEX’s co-founder and chief executive, commented on the addition of cricket to the platform’s offerings, calling it a major milestone for his team. He noted that the IPL has been a key goal of his team, which will continue adding more sports markets to its offerings.</p>
<p>BetDEX Celebrates the Addition with a Giveaway</p>
<p>BetDEX also announced a promotional giveaway ahead of the start of the Indian Premier League season. People can enter the giveaway by following BetDexLabs on Twitter, retweeting a post, joining the BetDEX discord and signing up for the BetDEX app. These methods will provide participants with 1, 2, 3 and 4 entries respectively.</p>
<p>Players can get additional entries once they have fulfilled all of the aforementioned conditions. The person with the most points will receive a prize of $500 USDT. Meanwhile, the second place will get $250 USDT and the third will get $100 USDT. In case of ties, BetDEX will run a raffle to determine the winner.</p>
<p>BetDEX remains optimistic about the development of Web3 betting, in spite of the hits the blockchain market has taken in recent times.</p>
<p>In November 2022, GamblingNews spoke with CEO Sudhakar just as the company had been licensed in the Isle of Man. Sudhakar told us about his team’s vision and ambition, saying that they hope to “lead the revolution in sports betting and web3.”</p>
<p>According to Sudhakar, BetDex will remain focused on Asia, South America, Africa and Europe. He concluded that the platform hopes to become the world’s largest sports betting exchange with market-leading customer satisfaction.</p>
