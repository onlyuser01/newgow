    <h1>Casino Palace Station Tuscany Suites Casino Sunrise Casino No Deposit Bonus Golden Dragon Casino Log</h1>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam! For a month I tried to resolve a dispute with 888starz.bet casino (Bittech B.V.), but my attempts were unsuccessful. I ask you for help.</p>
<p>On October 01, I bet my $ 1000 for withdrawal, but my wallet received $ 900 (</p>
<p>On October 1, I informed the casino that not all funds were received, $ 100 was not enough, that I was waiting for their receipt. I also asked if I could get my remaining funds without any deductions.</p>
<p>In response, the casino requested a screenshot of transactions from 01 to 02 October to confirm that I received only $ 900. On the third of October, I provided the appropriate confirmation.</p>
<p>The next day, I announced that I had a real estate transaction planned, and it was important for me to understand how much the rest of the money would be received and whether I would receive the unpaid $ 100.</p>
<p>In response, I was asked to contact security@888starz.bet and attach a photo of an identity document. On October 05, I wrote to the indicated address and attached a photo of my foreign passport.</p>
<p>In response, they pointed out the need to contact support@888starz.bet.</p>
<p>On October 6, I wrote to support@888starz.bet, and as a result received a response about the need to contact security@888starz.bet.</p>
<p>Thus, I sent messages to 2 email addresses, but I did not receive a clear answer from anyone.</p>
<p>Considering that I needed the money and I no longer had the time and opportunity to wait, on October 11, I put the remaining $ 1100 on the withdrawal.</p>
<p>But the casino canceled the withdrawal of my funds, indicating the need to place additional bets.</p>
<p>After the games, I put my $ 1110 on a withdrawal, but I got $ 999. The casino again withheld 10% of the withdrawal.</p>
<p>I again applied for clarifications at 2 addresses, provided screenshots of credits, but the casino still did not solve the problem with the return of deductions.</p>
<p>I ask you to help me figure out the situation and return $ 211.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
