    <h1>Lakes Region Casino Konami Slots Casino Casinos In Albuquerque New Mexico Fanduel Casino Palm Spring</h1>

<p>Hello 1good.bet,</p>
<p>I have already informed Casino Guru that my lost and unused deposit of â‚¬100 has been credited and refunded to my account. I tried to verify my account myself on October 6th, 2022, I sent all the documents by e-mail, I did not receive an answer.</p>
<p>The account was not verified as I was never prompted to do so. Not even after multiple successful deposits.</p>
<p>I emailed back on 03/03/2022 requesting self-exclusion due to gambling addiction. I have not received any reply to this. I wrote to support again on 3/31/2022 asking for self-exclusion due to gambling addiction. I did not register that it is necessary to write a separate email.</p>
<p>So, twice, I made it very clear that I was addicted to gambling. You yourself write in your policy "If an individual chooses to self-exclude, we will use all reasonable efforts to enforce self-exclusion. However, by consenting to self-exclusion, an individual has a responsibility not to attempt to circumvent self-exclusion." I asked again for self-exclusion due to gambling addiction on 10/07/2022, same on 10/09/2022 same as 10/10/2022. There was no response to this either, I had to close my account myself after I found the function to do so. I only received an answer from the support team on October 17th, 2022, i.e. 10 days later!</p>
<p>In addition, write your contact email "Help@1good.bet" all over the bottom of your page in large letters. You only find out that a separate email is required for a self-exclusion, which should be processed quickly and easily, if you are specifically looking for it.</p>
<p>You should urgently reconsider and revise your responsible gaming policy and not make it even more difficult for vulnerable players to self-exclude. Thanks</p>
