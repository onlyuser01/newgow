<p>The agreement includes BetMGM signage at the stadium, VIP fan experiences and co-branded content on social media</p>
<p>Sports betting and online gaming operator BetMGM announced it has entered into a partnership with Boston Red Sox to become an Official Sports Betting Partner of the MLB franchise from Massachusetts.</p>
<p>‘Elevate Gameday Experience’</p>
<p>The partnership with the Boston Red Sox marked the first agreement for BetMGM with a sports betting team from Massachusetts, while for the Red Sox, it is the first arrangement with a sports betting operator.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Matt Prevost, chief revenue officer of BetMGM, hailed the Red Sox as “one of baseball’s most beloved organizations,” eager “to bring BetMGM to their passionate fans” and work hand-in-hand with the team “to elevate the gameday experience in Boston.”</p>
<p>The partnership with the Red Sox will see BetMGM signage feature at the home of the Red Sox, Fenway Park, including on the Green Monster, the ballpark’s left field wall. In addition, the sports betting brand will have a suite at the stadium and offer fans VIP experiences, including access to batting practice with premium seats, alumni appearances, and ceremonial first pitches.</p>
<p>First Sports Betting Partner</p>
<p>Troup Parkinson, executive vice president of partnerships for the Boston Red Sox, also commented on the agreement, “proud to partner with BetMGM” while the states preparing for the official launch of mobile sports wagering to “enter a new era of professional sports betting.”</p>
<p>Given our strong relationship with MGM Resorts, BetMGM was the clear choice to become the first sports betting partner of the club, and we look forward to them offering sports betting opportunities to our fans in a safe and responsible manner. Troup Parkinson, executive VP of partnerships, Boston Red Sox</p>
<p>Also as part of the agreement, co-branded content will be integrated across the digital and social media platforms of both the sports betting brand and the MLB franchise from Boston.</p>
<p>Strengthen Ties with MGM Resorts</p>
<p>The partnership with BetMGM is set to further strengthen the Red Sox’s tie with MGM Resorts defined by a multi-year agreement that made the casino and hospitality company the Official Resort Casino of the Boston Red Sox and the naming rights of The MGM Music Hall at Fenway which opened in September.</p>
<p>On behalf of MGM Resorts, president and chief operating officer for Northeast Group, Chris Kelley, outlined that being the host of the annual Red Sox Winter weekend allowed MGM Springfield to position itself as “a destination for New England baseball fans.”</p>
<p>With sports betting now legal in Massachusetts, we remain committed, through GameSense, to offering an enjoyable and responsible experience for our guests, customers and MGM Rewards members. Chris Kelley, president &amp; COO, Northeast Group</p>
<p>GameSense, a responsible gaming program, developed and licensed to MGM Resorts by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, is an integral part of BetMGM’s efforts to provide responsible gaming education concurrent with its expansion into new markets.</p>
