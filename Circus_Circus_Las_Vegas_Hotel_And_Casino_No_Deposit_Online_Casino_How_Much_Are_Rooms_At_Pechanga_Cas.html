    <h1>Circus Circus Las Vegas Hotel And Casino No Deposit Online Casino How Much Are Rooms At Pechanga Cas</h1>

<p>On July the 9th in the early am I made a deposit of ten dollars which was supposed to come with a bonus of 30 free spins on the Lions Gems Game. When i went to play the game it just came up as a blank page and would not load any further. SO, of course I went to chat for support and they told me the usual which I had already done.</p>
<p>Log out, clear my browser cache and restart my computer. After doing that the game still would not play and they confirmed the 30 spins were added to my account. So then they said they would have to put into tech about this problem.</p>
<p>So I finished playing my ten dollars and then went for the weekend promotion. Which was deposit minimum ten dollars and get 60 free spins on Imperial Fruits 5 lines and after the deposit I went in to play my free spins and I got exactly the same thing. I also tried to go into Imperial Fruits 100 Lines and the other Imperial Fruit Game they have and all of them juist came up with the same blank page and would not finish loading.</p>
<p>So, once again I went into chat and told them the problem. This was now the third time in chat over relatively the same issue, only 2x now. The staff was great and as helpful as they could be and I tried the same things , logout , clear cache, restart computer and also tried the Microsoft edge browser but still got the same thing.</p>
<p>Now the fourth time in chat the next lady I spoke with was very kind and said she added some free spins on a different game for me for the time being and would put in another request to chat. He also told me that tech was working on the first issue at that time and they would email me as soon as it was resolved. I went into the Hot Coins Hold and Win Game that sher had put 25 free spins in for me and there we go again, I got the same blank page.</p>
<p>So, then I waited patiently for a few hours and when I received no email I sent them another email and I went back into chat to ask what was happening because I thought that I should have heard something back by now. This lady then told me to please contact them later and ask them to add the free spins because they were currently having a tehnical issue with all free spins.</p>
<p>So the next afternoon which was now the 9th midday I went into Chat again and explained the issue to another rep and this woman,(EVE) was very rude to me and told me the spins were in my account and ready to play after a few messages back and forth. It told her I realized that and I had already screenshot and pasted what the two games did when I went into them to show that I could not play them. She curtly said again the free spins have been added to your account and are available for me to play. Then one more message OK Then is there anything else I can help you with and I once again explained that I knew they were there but I could not play them and was a little upset by this time and said "have you not been listening?".</p>
<p>No reply so I shut the chat and noted that she had been quite rude to me in the little survey you usually receive at the end of a chat to rate the experience which I rated one star because of her attitude.</p>
<p>I then put in a third email to support and told them that I had not heard back and I believed the issue should have been resolved by then and that I deserved to have something for what I paid for. I suggested they give me the spins in different games and said sometimes certain games are restricted in BC and maybe that was the case. Or, they could give it to me in virtual funds to play on any games.</p>
<p>The email that I finally received back from them said that they could see that I had clamed my free spins and that I had played them so the case was now closed.</p>
<p>I wrote them back and said how could I have played them when the games would not play and that I had proven that to them in the last email with all six screenshots of the game not opening. I told them that in other words they stole my money because they did not honor their promotions and that they were dishonest.</p>
<p>I have attachedc all the emails and the screenshots from this incident and would appreciate whatever help you can give me to resolve this issue. I would like the free spins on other games or my twenty dollars returned to me and then I will be done with Boo Casino for good.</p>
<p>In the second email you will also see the attachment sof all the screenshots that I had sent through chat when requested I do so.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
