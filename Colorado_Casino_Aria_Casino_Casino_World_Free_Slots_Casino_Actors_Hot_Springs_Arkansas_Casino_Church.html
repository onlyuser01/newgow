<p>The world’s most legendary racetrack and home of the Kentucky Derby Churchill Downs Racetrack announced it has entered into a partnership with Venuetize to provide its guests with a customized mobile app experience.</p>
<p>New Way to Interact and Navigate</p>
<p>The partnership between Venuetize and Churchill Downs Racetrack will see the mobile-first and payment technology supplier deploy its solutions as part of a two-phase mobile experience aimed at ensuring guests at the racetrack a seamless way to interact and navigate the track and its amenities.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Casey Ramage, vice president of Marketing, Brand and Partnerships at Churchill Downs Racetrack, outlined the racetrack’s constant efforts “to improve the technology experience” for its guests.</p>
<p>“Through this partnership with Venuetize, we will engage our Kentucky Derby and Churchill Downs fans with our thrilling racing year-round,” Ramage concluded.</p>
<p>The new mobile app already available in both App Store and Google Play offers ticketing functionalities, including options to access, buy and transfer tickets, and maps and navigation throughout the venue such as find my seat, food and beverage kiosks and betting windows locations.</p>
<p>In addition, the app provides full race calendars with post times, results and odds, expert picks, messaging functionality, as well as a content hub featuring videos, news, social and lifestyle blogs.</p>
<p>The new mobile experience is also packed within an aesthetic design, which together with the app’s ease of use is expected to drive guest engagement for Churchill Downs Racetrack to a new level.</p>
<p>Jon Romm, chief executive officer at Venuetize, expressed the company’s commitment to continue extending its capabilities in support of premier clients such as Churchill Downs Racetrack and its guests, outlining the importance of the new partnership for both parties.</p>
<p>“Together, through a strong partnership and continued innovation, we’ll redefine the horse racing guest experience and exemplify the bridge between sports, entertainment, and gamification at next year’s marquee race, The Kentucky Derby,” Romm concluded.</p>
<p>In phase two of the new mobile experience, each of the Churchill Downs Racetrack and The Kentucky Derby brands will be showcased via a 2-in-1 approach within the app which will offer each of the brands its own user interface and content feed while keeping the main infrastructure sharing.</p>
<p>Busy First Half of September</p>
<p>The agreement with Venuetize is the latest for Churchill Downs Racetrack’s operator Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) in September, following several other key partnerships in the month that proves to be quite busy for the company so far.</p>
<p>Most recently, CDI promoted long-serving Gary Palmisano, Jr. to Executive Director of Racing to help the business implement standards and processes outlined in the Horse Racing Integrity and Safety Act across all of its racing properties.</p>
<p>Also in September, CDI signed a strategic partnership with FanDuel to supply the leading sportsbook operator with advanced horse racing solutions and facilitate pari-mutuel betting for FanDuel customers while at the beginning of the month, CDI’s purchase of the Chasers Poker Room in Salem, New Hampshire was finalized after the approval from the New Hampshire Lottery Commission.</p>
