<p>EveryMatrix has chosen New Jersey as the company’s entry-point in United States’ fast-developing iGaming market.</p>
<p>Casino Solutions Provider EveryMatrix Eyes New Jersey Entry</p>
<p>EveryMatrix is looking to break ground in the United States and has applied for a license from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (NJDGE). The company seeks to introduce its industry-leading integration platform, CasinoEngine, a powerful aggregator that allows operators to access a wide range of quality products that boost engagement and retention rates.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix is convinced that CasinoEngine will be nothing but an asset to the iGaming landscape in New Jersey, which has been developing at full bore. Commenting on these developments EveryMatrix Americas LLC President Erik Nyman said that the company was pleased to announce that it has chosen New Jersey as its entry-point for the fast-developing iGaming market in the United States.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to inform that we have filed our license application in our first US State. The Garden State has enjoyed great success with exceptional development over the last years. This is a testament of the solid regulatory framework based on player protection, business stability and growth.” -EveryMatrix Americas LLC President Erik Nyman</p>
<p>EveryMatrix will play a key role in the market, Nyman said, supporting the further expansion and growth of licensed operators in the Garden States over the next years. New Jersey is a good strategic choice for at least several reasons.</p>
<p>United States’ Tipped as Largest Market</p>
<p>For starters, the state is one of the most liberal jurisdictions when it comes to online gaming in the United States. The state is the reason why the sports betting industry is legal in the country today by legalizing it in 2018. However, New Jersey regulated online casino gaming in 2014, giving it a four-year head-start on sports betting operations.</p>
<p>In 2020, online casinos have so far generated close to $1 billion in gross gaming revenue (GGR), turning the state alone in one of the largest markets worldwide. Meanwhile, EveryMatrix has been busy in the past month.</p>
<p>In October, the company acquired TOTOIT, an IT company to reinforce the company’s expertise in the development of industry-leading gaming solutions. Late last month, the company teamed up with FunFair Games, allowing FunFair to distribute its portfolio through EveryMatrix’s Remote Gaming Server RGS Matrix solution.</p>
