<p>China Developing Hengqin Island to Complement Growing Tourism in Nearby Macau</p>

<p>China has announced plans to develop Hengqin Island into an “international recreation zone.” It’s part of an effort to expand Macau and ease congestion in the enclave’s busiest corridors.</p>

<p>The State Council of the People’s Republic of China approved construction plans to develop the largely vacant island.</p>
<p>Construction of the island will be centered around the Greater Bay Area’s development, with efforts to speed up the creation of a modern industrial system focusing on recreation and tourism, and to deepen the cooperation between South China’s Guangdong province, Hong Kong, and Macau,” the State Council said in a release. “It also will bolster Macau’s economy.”</p>
<p>The council says the goal is to create an “international standard recreation and tourist island” that will complement nearby Macau and its thriving tourism industry.</p>
<p>Hengqin, located just west of Macau, is three times the size of the gaming enclave. It is connected to Cotai by the six-lane Lotus Bridge.</p>
<p>Western Expansion</p>
<p>Macau casinos are no longer operating in a VIP-first market. Instead, the general public continues to increase in importance, and is fueling the gaming industry’s rebound.</p>
<p>Amid President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on junket groups that organize trips for the mainland’s wealthiest citizens to Macau, gross gaming revenues (GGR) fell from $45 billion in 2013, to below $28 billion in 2016. The market has bounced back, with total casino win at $37.8 billion last year.</p>
<p>Casino operators of the multibillion-dollar integrated resorts have diversified their amenities and attractions to appeal to a wider demographic. Visitation totaled 35.8 million people in 2018, a record mark and 10 percent surge on the prior year.</p>
<p>However, there are concerns that at just 12 square miles in area, Macau is becoming too crowded and the overall guest experience could be damaged as a result.</p>
<p>Macau Liaison Office Director Fu Ziying – who represents the Special Administrative Region (SAR) in the Beijing capital – said last month that the enclave should continue to diversify with non-gaming assets to further grow tourism. However, he conceded that land is becoming scarce.</p>
<p>The Coloane Village, which is south of the Cotai Strip, remains a sleepy community on the peninsula’s southernmost end. Residents and local officials there want to keep it that way, which is why China’s State Council is targeting Hengqin.</p>
<p>Hengqin Past, Future</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Hengqin has been considered for development. In 2005, Las Vegas Sands proposed a $2 billion non-gaming property featuring 19,000 hotel rooms, multiple convention facilities, golf course, and marina.</p>
<p>Hengqin officials initially signed off on the plans, but then the People’s Republic interjected and decided to develop its own scheme for the island. However, aside from the construction of a few buildings, it’s largely sat vacant since. Now, Xi is ready to move forward with creating a Macau non-gaming hospitality-focused neighbor.</p>
<p>The State Council says the Guangdong government – Hengqin’s province – will be tasked with developing the recreational and tourism attractions with assistance from the People’s Republic. Specifics as to what the vision might entail were not revealed this week.</p>
