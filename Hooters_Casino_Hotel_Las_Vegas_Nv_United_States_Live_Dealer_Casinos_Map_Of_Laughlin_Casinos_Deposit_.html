<p>The Gauselmann Group-owned casino software developer will leverage Merkur online slots and integrate them with 888casino’s library. There will be 10 Merkur slots that will now be added to the available games, including El Torero, Blazing Star, and Eye of Horus.</p>
<p>Adding More Worthwhile Games to the Casino</p>
<p>More Merkur games will then be added to 888casino’s library in time, as the agreement will remain active and a source of fresh content for the operator. Edict Egaming CEO Dominic-Daniel Liénard has welcomed the opportunity and hailed 888casino as one of the leading casino operators. The partnership allows Edict Egaming to secure yet another established partner:</p>
<p>We are proud to be able to offer 888casino users our diverse portfolio of Merkur games and are confident that our offering will be met with great enthusiasm by customers. Edict Egaming CEO Dominic-Daniel Liénard</p>
<p>Merkur slots are delivered directly through Edict Aggregator Solutions, which already has more than 200 games in its portfolio and is continuing to gain traction as it adds more third-party operators. 888 Group international managing director Nir Hakarmeli has welcomed the opportunity to see yet another aggregation solution added to the list of trusted suppliers for 888 Group and its casino brand:</p>
<p>We are delighted to be collaborating with Edict to add its Merkur slots to our entertaining and content-rich portfolio of games on 888casino. 888 Group international managing director Nir Hakarmeli</p>
<p>Hakarmeli hailed the opportunity to team up with Edict Egaming as a “critical” part of the company’s long-term strategy and aspirations to be recognized as a leader when it comes to online casino content. This way, Hakarmeli explained, 888casino can remain at the very forefront of gaming experiences for players all across the world.</p>
<p>888casino Grows Its Content Portfolio Globally</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with Dominic-Daniel and the team in the months ahead,” the executive concluded. All the while, 888casino has been significantly expanding its global reach and content library. The company has added games by R. Franco Digital in 888casino.</p>
<p>The company also grew its content offering in Ontario, Canada with a 1×2 Network. The company got another significant leg-up with EveryMatrix and the company’s aggregation solution CasinoEngine. Overall, 888casino has been looking to significantly expand its content portfolio and it has been succeeding.</p>
