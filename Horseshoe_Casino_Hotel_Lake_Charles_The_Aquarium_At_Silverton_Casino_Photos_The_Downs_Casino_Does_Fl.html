<p>US Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) is once again seeking the Democratic nomination for president of the United States, as the congressman announced his candidacy this week with a campaign goal of “transforming our country.”</p>

<p>Online bettors at PredictIt don’t have much faith that such a transformation is likely. The internet exchange, which facilitates the trading of political outcomes, has shares of a Sanders 2020 victory selling for 12 cents.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump – who Sanders calls “the most dangerous president in modern American history” – continues to lead the way, with his shares currently at 34 cents. The incumbent’s stock has increased by two cents over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) is at 14 cents to win the White House. Former VP Joe Biden (D) and former US. Rep. Beto O’Rourke (R-Texas) share Sanders’ price of 12 cents.</p>
<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) is next at a distant six cents. Current VP Mike Pence (R), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota), and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) are at the same valuation.</p>
<p>Shares of the winning candidate will be redeemed at $1 each. PredictIt bettors are permitted to invest up to $850 on each market.</p>
<p>Sanders Attacks Billionaires</p>
<p>Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, launched his 2020 run by attacking the political, social, and economic climate in the US. One of his main goals is to rid the country of special interests and billionaires who spend unlimited amounts of money to sway campaigns.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands billionaire Sheldon Adelson has been the Republican Party’s largest donor in each of the last two election cycles. Along with his wife, the Adelsons gave $82.58 million to GOP causes in 2016, and $123.25 million during last year’s midterms.</p>
<p>Billionaire Michael Bloomberg has pledged $500 million for 2020 in order to defeat Trump. The businessman is also mulling a run, though PredictIt has his 2020 chances at a distant three cents.</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it, the powerful special interests in this country have unbelievable power and they want to maintain the status quo,” Sanders said today. “They have unlimited amounts of money to spend on campaigns and lobbying, and have huge influence over the media and political parties.”</p>
<p>Sanders says a grass roots movement that’s “never been seen in American history” is his only chance at winning in November of 2020.</p>
<p>2020 Longshots</p>
<p>Election betting overseas is a cherished pastime, and oddsmakers there aren’t bypassing the drama-filled US political arena.</p>
<p>Paddy Power, the Irish bookmaker known for taking the comical – perhaps absurd political wager – is up to its usual tricks. The sportsbook caused much controversy in 2008 when it offered odds on the chances of President Barack Obama being assassinated.</p>
<p>For 2020, Paddy Power is being more tasteful. The bookmaker is offering customers numerous names who seemingly have no chance (or interest) of running for POTUS.</p>
<p>They include New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady at 150/1, Chelsea Clinton (200/1), Beyoncé (300/1), Kim Kardashian (500/1), and even disgraced actor Kevin Spacey (500/1), though the latter does have experience playing the president on Netflix’s House of Cards.</p>
<p>Back to actual serious odds, UK bookmakers have Trump at 2/1 to win re-election. Harris has the next shortest odds at around 6/1.</p>
