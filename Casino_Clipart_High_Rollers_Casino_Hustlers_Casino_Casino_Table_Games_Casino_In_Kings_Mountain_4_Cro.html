    <h1>Casino Clipart High Rollers Casino Hustlers Casino Casino Table Games Casino In Kings Mountain 4 Cro</h1>

<p>Requested a withdrawal on the 27/05/20 for winnings of 600 euros. Account was completely verified on that date.</p>
<p>Started communicating on Live Chat on the 18/06/20 to enquire about the delay, as this seems like a long timeframe for withdrawals compared to other casinos. I have been given several reasons including 'this is normal policy and procedure', it is a 'technical review', that 'I must be patient as they are dealing with other withdrawal requests' and that it 'has been passed to the financial department'. I have also corresponded by email over the last few day, but receive vague one line answers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, they actually blocked my account, and when I enquired why they indicated that I had breached their T&amp;Cs. No further explanation has been given.</p>
<p>I have been incredibully courteous and polite in all my correspondence with the Support Team at 4Crowns, and would just like to receive what I won legitimately and fairly.</p>
<p>Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>With kindest regards,</p>
<p>Ann</p>
