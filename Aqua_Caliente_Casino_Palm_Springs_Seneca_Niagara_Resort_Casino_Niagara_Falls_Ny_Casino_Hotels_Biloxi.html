<p>I sent my ID selfie in less than 24 hrs. after the email. I contacted live chat support to ask them the status and one of the reps said that I am approved and wait until I get an email from them about your withdrawal. I asked how long this takes and they said 7-10 business days. On the 7th day I contacted chat support and asked them the status again. Russell said it was still pending. I asked can you contact them and get an update?. He responded and said they aren't available. I asked do you have a phone number I can call and they said they don't speak to players directly. On the 10th day, They put my withdrawal money back into my account. I noticed it this morning. I contacted a representative and they said make another withdrawal. I made another withdrawal and now I get the email that they need a photo ID selfie of myself which I replied I already did that a week and a half ago and it was approved.</p>
<p>3 days ago I contacted chat support again and I spoke to CS person today and they said sorry for the delayed withdrawal. You will have your funds within 10 days. Today I checked in with customer support again. this is what this guy said. They all have a different answer each time i contact them. Now I have duplicate files?. I originally asked only for my ID selfie for my first withdrawal, which i sent immediately. This place is playing games.</p>
