<p>Enter the Enchanting Realm Reigned by Fairies</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s chief gaming officer, Mark McGinley, spoke about the new game, describing it as one that will carry players to a fantasy world while attracting the “lucrative respins mode to the fore” with the help of the Mystery Symbols.</p>
<p>McGinley described the slot as “another visually fantastic creation” from their talented team that is meant to make fans worldwide rejoice while exploring the captivating theme of the fairy-tale kingdom ruled by strong and fierce female fairies.</p>
<p>The mysterious world is built with the help of a one-of-a-kind structure of the reels and it is maintained with wins that can unexpectedly come from either side for additional chances of winning big.</p>
<p>The previously mentioned Mystery symbols carry supernatural powers as they can change and lead the way to “captivating wins”. To unlock the bonus round, players must come across the ultimate key represented by the Free Spins symbol that can be found on either end of the land.</p>
<p>The high-paying symbols in the game are the five fairies. The colorful orb represents the mystery symbol that can instantly turn into a random spin. When part of a winning combination, the same symbol can trigger the Sticky Respins mode.</p>
<p>Here, the rest of the icons will be removed from the grid, followed by the random symbol being chosen once again for the succeeding spin.</p>
<p>Players who land two Scatters on the first and last reel enter Free Spins mode. Here, they are rewarded with a minimum of seven spins. While this mode is active, the landing Mystery Symbols will preserve their positions on the reels for the remainder of the bonus round, significantly increasing the chances of respins.</p>
<p>Players in some jurisdictions will be given the opportunity to purchase the bonus feature in exchange for 100x a player’s stake.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, Yggdrasil launched Wild Stack Frenzy with Free Spins and an x5,000 max multiplier, followed by the release of Beasty Blox GigaBlox in September.</p>
