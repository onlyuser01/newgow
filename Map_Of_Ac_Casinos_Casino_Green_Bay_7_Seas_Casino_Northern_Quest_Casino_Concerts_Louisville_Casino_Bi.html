    <h1>Map Of Ac Casinos Casino Green Bay 7 Seas Casino Northern Quest Casino Concerts Louisville Casino Bi</h1>

<p>I deposited $125. Their rules are, in order to withdraw any money, cash or bonus, you must play through your own money 30 times before asking for a withdrawal. They tell you in your account how much playthrough percentage you have met. I guess you have never played at billy bingo or any of the sites, because they are all basically the same. In other words, once you have played and spent $3750, you can withdraw. $125 x 30= $3750. So, I met the withdrawal. They took the withdrawal out of my account. Then they said they are having problems with their payment processor. So they put the money back into my acount. NOw this money has already met the 30 times playthrough. But they put it back into my account as if it was a deposit. AND, they started the 30 times playthrough all over again! GET IT? Then they took the money out of my account again as if they were going to pay me, and guess what? Server problems. So they put it back in, and started the 30 times playthrough all over again. Over and over and over! they are a scam. Never payed me, and stole all my money! Now, after I complained many many times, they said they would reimburse my credit card, since they don't have the money to pay me, and blacklist me. So now they have locked my account so I cannot enter Billy Bingo, and just as I expected, no withdrawal, no credit card reimbursement, they won't even answer my emails. BECAUSE THEY ARE CROOKS AND SCAMMERS!</p>
<p>I reported to my credit card company, and they closed my credit card because it seems Billy Bingo is contantly charging my credit card and stealing money! The credit card company is now investigating the company for theft, and credit card company has reimbursed me for all the charges from Billy Bingo, which erroniously says for advertising.</p>
<p>So I warn everyone to stay away from this no good site!</p>
<p>There is no way to send an attachment through this thing that I am typing on. At the top it says insert image, but my emails are not an image! I have many emails back and forth to billy bingo to substantiate my claim.</p>
