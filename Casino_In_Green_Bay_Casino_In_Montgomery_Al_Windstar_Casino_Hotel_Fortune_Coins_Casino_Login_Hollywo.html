<p>The UFC is back at Fight Island on Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, the big marketing move Dana White orchestrated during the nadir of the pandemic with UFC 267 promising a series of great fights this weekend. The title fight on Saturday, October 30 will feature Jan Blachowicz vs Glover Teixeira and the bout is one that we have been expecting.</p>
<p>Blachowicz is posted as the heavy favorite here at (-300) and he will be squaring up against the underdog Teixeira posted at (+235). The fight will be aired on ESPN+ at 2 pm EST and will be available as pay-per-view. DraftKings is giving Teixeira somewhat worse odds, but we are keen to continue exploring the fights and see what we can expect from all participants.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there are many excellent ancillary fights you will definitely want to at least check out. Magomed Ankalaev will take on Volkan Oezdemir and Petr Yan will fight Cory Sandhagen and we think these fights will be well worth your time.</p>
<p>Odds to Win UFC 267: Jan Blachowicz vs Glover Teixeira</p>
<p>Fighter Odds Jan Blachowicz -300 Glover Teixeira +235 Fighter Odds Magomed Ankalaev -350 Volkan Oezdemir +270 Fighter Odds Petr Yan -235 Cory Sandhagen +190 Odds at DraftKings as of October 27</p>
<p>The UFC 267 will feature several other interesting bouts for you to look out for. You may be interested in checking out Islam Makhachev vs Dan Hooker or Alexander Volkov vs Murci Tybura, and Li Jingliang vs Khamzat Chimaev.</p>
<p>What to Expect from Teixeira vs Blachowicz</p>
<p>Jan Blachowicz has been one of the most prominent MMA fighters. The Polish national has forged his legacy back at home and the professional Ultimate Fighting Championship over the past years with his track record now at 28-8-0.</p>
<p>He has posted a six-fight winning streak and in the past fights. He managed to secure wins against Israel Adesanya, upsetting his spotless record of 20-0-0 fights until that fight. Blachowicz took out Reyes, another up-and-coming MMA prospect who was stopped short in September 2020.</p>
<p>Not only that but he fought and won against Ronaldo Souza and Luke Rockhold. He has been able to win most of those fights with a good mix of KOs and by Decision which means that Blachowicz is more than happy to go the distance with any fighter. That is precisely what Teixeira should be on the watch out for. Blachowicz is a deserved favorite in this one.</p>
<p>Tale of the Tape: Blachowicz vs Teixeira</p>
<p>Blachowicz Vs. Teixeira 38 Age 41 6’2” Height 6’2” 78” Reach 76” 28-8-0 Record 32-7-0</p>
<p>What about Teixeira Performing Well in the Bout?</p>
<p>We can definitely expect Teixeira to give it his all. He has 32-7-0 as his overall record and even though he is a bit older, Teixeira is every bit as formidable as his opponent. In fact, you may argue that Teixeira is unjustly posted as the underdog here, although there are subtle signs that betray that his age is working against him.</p>
<p>He has defeated Thiago Santos, Anthony Smith, Nikita Krylov, Ion Cutelaba and Karl Roberson in his last five bouts and his last loss was to Corey Anderson in 2018. Admittedly, Blachowicz was able to defeat Anderson.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, Teixeira was posted as the underdog to Jon Jones and he lost. There definitely seems to be fighting spirit left in the titan of MMA but so far as his chances of winning on Saturday go, we believe The Brazilian Pit Bull would be ultimately subdued by Blachowicz.</p>
<p>As to the rest of the fights, you can expect some interesting developments all over the place. We think Ankalaev will have no problem bringing home the fight against Oezdemir and Volkov should be able to win against Tybura.</p>
