    <h1>Casinos In Philadelphia Aruba Casino Casino Denver Las Vegas Casino Hotels In Cherokee Nc Near Casin</h1>

<p>Hello! Please accept my complaint to North casino. I tried to solve the problem without involving a third party, but I did not succeed. In this regard, I turn to you for help.</p>
<p>The casino took my $2282 winnings and blocked my account. I don't agree with this.</p>
<p>On March 28, the casino reported that the confiscation of funds and blocking were caused by a repeated violation of bonus conditions. However, despite my requests to provide evidence of a repeated violation, the casino did not provide evidence.</p>
<p>I inform you that initially, not fully understanding the rules of the game, I committed a violation. For this violation, the casino withheld my winnings of $249. However, in the future, having studied the rules in detail, I continued to play and no longer allowed any violations. Moreover, the casino itself gave me the opportunity to use bonuses, which I did. And when I managed to win, the casino confiscated my money and blocked me!</p>
<p>I guess the casino decided to take a win-win position: the casino takes my money if I lose or confiscate my winnings if I win!!!!</p>
<p>This behavior is contrary not only to the norms of international law, but also violates the general norms of morality!</p>
<p>In addition, from a legal point of view, the casino is not entitled to withhold funds for violations for which I have already incurred responsibility!</p>
<p>I hope for your help in resolving my dispute with North Casino.</p>
