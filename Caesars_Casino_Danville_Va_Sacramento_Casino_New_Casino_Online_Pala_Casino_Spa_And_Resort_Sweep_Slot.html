<p>The official gambling platform GambetDC of the DC Lottery is already live. Exciting times are coming for DC residents as a mobile app is due to launch in June.</p>
<p>The DC Lottery Launched Official Gambling Platform GambetDC</p>
<p>GambetDC is the official gambling platform of the DC Lottery which is already live in the state. The platform, developed in partnership with the Greek Intralot, had to go live back in March, but due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the state, the launch was pushed back. This impacted the unveiling of the mobile app, which is expected to be released in June. Keeping in mind that most major sports are yet to be resumed, the current release was deemed as “soft launch“.</p>
<p>Even though major sports are yet to be resumed, punters will still have a chance to feel the action as the Bundesliga (Germany’s soccer league), UFC and NASCAR have already returned. Actually, the three sports are already endorsed for betting in DC. Furthermore, in the next few weeks sports, fans can expect the return of the PGA tour, but NHL, MLB and NBA are still negotiating the possibilities for resuming operations. Unfortunately sports wagers on horse racing won’t be available on the platform.</p>
<p>A Few Hiccups Preceded the Launch of GambetDC</p>
<p>It looks like the current launch of the platform and expected release of the mobile application draw an end to a dispute between Dylan Carragher and the DC District. The dispute began early last year when Carragher challenged the District and its principals in breaching the “Home Rule Act”. This was initiated because the District voted to award a $251 million no-bid contract to Greek firm Intralot</p>
<p>This led to the imposing of a temporary restraining order by Judge Joan Zeldon in September last year. Under the order, Intralot had suspended lottery and sports betting activities under the contract. Then in October, the Washington D.C. Superior Court decided against blocking the no-bid contract. This effectively allowed Intralot to continue working on the platform.</p>
<p>In present times, looking at the official GambetDC website, one can tell that exiting times are due for DC sports fans. Statement by GambetDC says: “It is a new betting experience in the District that makes live betting and wagering on sporting events just as easy as watching them. Whether you bet using the GambetDC app or website, you can bet with friends, have fun, game responsibly, and join a community of winners.” Furthermore, the GambetDC team stressed out that sports betting is powered by the same DC Lottery, known and trusted since 1982.</p>
