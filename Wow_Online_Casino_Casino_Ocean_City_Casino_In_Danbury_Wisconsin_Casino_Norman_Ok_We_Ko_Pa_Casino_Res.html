    <h1>Wow Online Casino Casino Ocean City Casino In Danbury Wisconsin Casino Norman Ok We Ko Pa Casino Res</h1>

<p>Renowned iGaming supplier and developer Red Tiger will now work with Groupe Patrouche, and specifically supply the newly-licensed Casino du Lac Meyrin with the company’s 70-odd slot games. More gaming releases are planned throughout 2020.</p>
<p>Casino du Lac Meyrin Secures Red Tiger Content Deal</p>
<p>Newly licensed Swiss gaming operator, Casino du Lac Meyrin owned by Groupe Patrouche, will now offer Red Tiger online slots, the result of a newly-forged alliance between the casino’s parent company and the NetEnt-owned game developer. Casino du Lac is one of the two casinos to receive an online license by the Switzerland National Council and the Eidgenössische Spielbankenkommission.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Swiss players will enjoy the full variety of Red Tiger games and Casino du Lac Meyrin will benefit from the full range of features that come with the iGaming software offered by Red Tiger, including the smart spins marketing tool.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Casino du Lac Head of Online Casino, Alexander Sosnovski, said that it was an opportunity to fulfil the brand’s commitment to providing players with “the most innovative slot games.” Red Tiger, Sosnovski noted, made a superb addition to the growing portfolio of available products.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to have signed this commercial agreement with one of the industry’s leading game developers and we look forward to a fruitful relationship in the years ahead.”</p>
<p>Red Tiger’s Commercial Director, Chris Looney, also commented the deal. According to him, Groupe Patrouche’s gaming excellence was the right entry point into the Swiss market and Red Tiger was happy to be able to supply players there with top-of-the-line gaming products.</p>
<p>Red Tiger has over 70 titles available right now and many more coming down the pipeline, Looney noted in the official statement.</p>
<p>“Designing cutting-edge products is what we pride ourselves on at Red Tiger. We are investing heavily in the market and we look forward to offering our games and marketing tools to a new audience.”</p>
<p>Red Tiger Continues to Expand Network of Operators and Partners</p>
<p>Red Tiger previously struck a deal with EnergyCasino, landing the brand its full portfolio and expanding the casino’s existing offer. Specifically, the partnership featured a customizable tool that allows the casino to create “compelling campaigns” for the brand’s players.</p>
<p>Again, in May, Red Tiger teamed up with Pronet Gaming, boosting its distribution network and consolidating its footprint as well as exploring new markets. More recent partners to have teamed up with Red Tiger earlier in 2020 include Lottormart, Stride Gaming, Svenska Spel, Sky Vegas, and many others.</p>
