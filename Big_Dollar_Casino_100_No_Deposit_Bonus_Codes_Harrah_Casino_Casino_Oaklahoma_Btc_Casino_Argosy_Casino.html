<p>Not to be "that guy", but I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.</p>
<p>Casinos don't usually just willingly call it a day and decide to close up shop. Most of them are forced to close because they're losing their license and/or can't afford to pay their players.</p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong here. Good luck to ya!</p>
<p>Edit: Oops, thought this discussion was still related to Oddsring (formerly Twin) casino.</p>
<p>Either way, Twin has changed hands multiple times over the last year and their current license status it a little sketchy to me.</p>
<p>They show both, and Antilles license and a Kahnawake license, but I can't find a license number from Antillephone and Kahnawake says that they've been licensed since 2006, which doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever.</p>
