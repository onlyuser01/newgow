    <h1>Venetian Casino Las Vegas Casino Dealer Tropicana Casino Evansville Viejas Casino Resort Hollywood C</h1>

<p>Swedish gambling operator LeoVegas has inked a new three-year agreement with the Italian soccer club Inter Milan. The agreement will see the operator’s news division, LeoVegas.News, as the official infotainment partner of the sports team.</p>
<p>LeoVegas.News Becomes a Partner of Inter Milan</p>
<p>Infotainment is a type of news that informs and entertains at the same time. LeoVegas.News will, therefore, feature special Inter Milan content and will engage soccer fans with exclusive digital content.</p>
<p>Inter Milan, on the other hand, will promote LeoVegas’ brand during its home games at the San Siro stadium. The soccer club will feature LeoVegas.News’ logo on its home stadium’s big screen and sideline LEDs. In addition, the team will promote the brand at its Appiano Gentile-based Suning Training Centre.</p>
<p>The team will support LeoVegas.News and will popularize its brand while the latter will produce premium content for the athletes’ fans. Inter Milan’s decision to ink an infotainment-oriented deal attests to its commitment to its community.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Will Highlight Their Shared Values</p>
<p>Luca Danovaro, chief revenue officer at Inter Milan, said that the club is excited to have LeoVegas.News join the Nerazzurri family. He lauded the company for offering high-quality entertaining news and said that this is in line with the team’s commitment to always engage its international fanbase with premium content.</p>
<p>The promise of exclusive content of the highest quality to our international fanbase is one of the cornerstones of the growth strategy to increasingly become a global entertainment company, and we are happy to have found the same attention to and desire of growth in this field with LeoVegas.News. Luca Danovaro, CRO, Inter Milan</p>
<p>Danovaro noted that the new partnership will help the team grow and reach more fans. In addition, it will help existing fans to become a part of the Inter Milan world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, LeoVegas.News’ chief marketing officer, Niklas Lindahl, added that his company is delighted to join forces with such an internationally esteemed and beloved soccer club. Lindahl said that LeoVegas.News is looking forward to serving as the team’s infotainment partner and providing its fans with premium content.</p>
<p>Our partnership rests on our shared cultural approach towards digital entertainment that involves and excites Nerazzurri fans and football lovers in general, who can tell anecdotes, stories and interesting trivia for our users. Moreover, through Inter Legends, we can retrace the great history of the Nerazzurri and narrate the crucial moments that have made it one of the most important teams in the world. Niklas Lindahl, CMO, LeoVegas.News</p>
<p>Lindahl concluded that LeoVegas.News’ goal will be to spread and highlight the qualities and commitment to sports that LeoVegas.News and Inter Milan share.</p>
<p>This news follows a partnership deal that LeoVegas inked with Manchester City FC in early September.</p>
