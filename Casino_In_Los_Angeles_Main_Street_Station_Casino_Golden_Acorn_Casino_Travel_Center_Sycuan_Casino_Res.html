<p>The Houston Texans vs. Baltimore Ravens is an AFC Divisional Round game, which will take place at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on Saturday, January 20, 2024</p>
<p>The Houston Texans sank the Cleveland Browns in the Wild Card game and are now hoping to do the same to the Baltimore Ravens. This time, however, theyâ€™re faced with a much tougher challenge given that Baltimore finished the regular season as the No. 1 seed in the AFC.</p>

<p>Can the Houston Texans Slay Another Giant?</p>
<p>At the start of the season, the Houston Texans were seen as a team in transition whose main goal was to introduce its youngsters to the world of elite football. However, their rookies â€“ particularly their quarterback C.J. Stroud â€“ quickly proved theyâ€™re already elite.</p>
<p>They led Houston to a 10-7 record in the regular season, taking this team to the postseason for the first time since 2019.</p>

<p>Then, in the Wild Card Round, they destroyed the favored Cleveland Browns 45-14, with Stroud once again producing a fantastic performance, throwing for three touchdowns and zero interceptions.</p>
<p>The Texans have made it to the Divisional Round for the fifth time in the history of the franchise. They have never gone past this round, but maybe 2024 is when that will change? Not if youâ€™re asking the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<p>Reasons Why Baltimore Ravens are -9.5-Point Favorites</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens were brilliant in the regular season, going 13-4 and winning the No. 1 seed in the AFC. They wouldâ€™ve gone (probably) 14-3, but they didnâ€™t care much about the final game of the regular season, in which their backups lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 17-10.</p>
<p>With their key men on the field â€“ most notably, quarterback Lamar Jackson â€“ these guys have been fantastic throughout the season. This is especially impressive because their schedule in 2023 was pretty tough.</p>
<p>That, however, did not stop them. Instead, they easily defeated such heavyweights as the San Francisco 49ers (33-19 on the road), the Miami Dolphins (56-19 at home), and the Cincinnati Bengals (34-20 before Cincyâ€™s QB Joe Burrow got injured).</p>
<p>Houston Texans vs. Baltimore Ravens Prediction</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens have the best defense in the NFL, conceding just 16.5 points per game. They also have the No. 3 offense, which produces 28.4 points on average. Knowing this, itâ€™s clear why theyâ€™re favored to beat the Texans on Saturday.</p>
<p>We are certain theyâ€™re going to win, but the Texans have no intention of surrendering without a fight. Theyâ€™re going to give them war, which is why we probably wonâ€™t see the hosts cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Houston Texans +9.5</p>
