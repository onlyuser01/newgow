    <h1>Casino Real Money Los Vegas Casino Casinos In Atlanta Red River Casino Treasure Island Casino Concer</h1>

<p>The newest free-to-play football game Free Or 4 debuted last weekend. The game is the result of a collaboration between the sports-game provider SportCaller and the iconic sports betting operator William Hill.</p>
<p>The leading free-to-play (FTP) sports-game provider SportCaller rolled out its newest game, Free Or 4 for William Hill last weekend. The new football FTP game debuted with a call for “an immediate and appreciable spike in engagement“. To play Free Or 4, players must choose six games which they think three or four goals will be scored from the long list of Saturday 3 pm UK kick-offs. Once a player makes six successful selections choosing correct games, they receive a prize of £200 in free sportsbook bets. Furthermore, there are also smaller prizes for players who have chosen correctly five matches or even four matches.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, the FTP game Football21 featured a jackpot of £10,000 weekly. Now, with the new weekly game, Free Or 4, William Hill returns to free-to-play football. “Free Or 4 demonstrates an important change in FTP focus, moving away from low-probability prize pots as a means of mass-market acquisition to a far greater level of sophistication and appeal via attainable prizes as a robust method of retention,” reads a press release by SportCaller.</p>
<p>The new FTP game Free Or 4 is the result of a collaboration between William Hill and SportCaller. The game aims at promoting retention and boosting user experience for the highly popular UK football leagues. SportCaller finds new and innovative ways to boost customer retention, offering William Hill an opportunity to optimize and boost its consumer base on time for the football season relaunch.</p>
<p>Immediate and Encouraging Results</p>
<p>The Managing Director at SportCaller, Cillian Barry said in a statement: “Flexibility in the ideation and deployment of FTP games came to the fore during the sporting shutdown, but we’re seeing that trend extend in sync with the new normal.” He outlined that William Hill understands the shifting of sands of engagement and according to him it was a great experience to work with William Hill’s dedicated team.</p>
<p>The result of the collaboration is a game which is simple, yet holds universal appeal and a core retention mechanic, said SportCaller’s MD. Furthermore, Barry added that the early engagement levels have been impressive and the conversion rates of active users proved the trust and brand recognition.</p>
<p>“The results have been both immediate and encouraging and I look forward to seeing how our customers engage with the game throughout the domestic football season.” Liam Barbour, Head of Customer Product at William Hill</p>
<p>Liam Barbour, Head of Customer Product at William Hill said that it is fantastic to broaden the ongoing collaboration with SportCaller and return to FTP football. He outlined that the company took its time to develop Free Or 4 while collaborating with multiple focus groups. To achieve the straightforward concept the operator did customer research as well as testing. In conclusion, Barbour said that SportCaller helped to enhance brand loyalty with its gameplay finesse.</p>
