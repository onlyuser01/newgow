    <h1>Gold Country Casino Hotel Temecula Casino Bronco Billys Casino Www Vanessa Casino Com Blog Rain Rock</h1>

<p>Hello folks</p>
<p>I'm back today, even though it's been 2 months since my disaster with Icecasino.</p>
<p>But I am of the opinion that if you have been cheated out of your winnings to such an extent, you have to reveal these disasters to posterity, to other players, at least that is something you owe to make publicly available, be it as a warning, as a precautionary reminder to everyone , or what ever.</p>
<p>At that time, I no longer felt mentally capable of continuing to comment on the events because it was completely tearing me apart emotionally and I simply needed the distance to no longer be emotionally vulnerable to the matter.</p>
<p>Today I'm telling you because the anger is still there.</p>
<p>And something like this shouldn't happen to any fair, loyal player, at a casino that boasts a 10 out of 10 rating in publicly renowned forums.</p>
<p>But it seems to be standard throughout, given all the experience that you can read here again and again.</p>
<p>After I waited for my ‚Ç¨4500 for almost 3 weeks, shortly before the nervous collapse, thousands of chats and daily harping and stalling from support with irrelevant standardized answers, ‚Ç¨1000 of it had arrived in my account, the rest, i.e. 3500, always arrived credited back to my balance in divided amounts after the money had already been issued for payment by, as they said, an external payment provider for almost 3 weeks.</p>
<p>I was repeatedly told they were sorry, that there were difficulties with the payment provider, and that I should then use another payout method.</p>
<p>After 3 weeks had almost passed.</p>
<p>Please admit, apart from the already more than ridiculous approach and ignorantly negligent handling of the payout policy towards the customer, it throws you into an incredibly deep hole of anger and frustration.</p>
<p>Not to mention the hassle of verification, which was completed long beforehand and was immediately rolled out as soon as I made a withdrawal request.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how many times I have to take a selfie and another credit card and a proof of salary that shows everything, sensitive data, tax number etc etc, nothing can be blacked out, not even a single transaction that really doesn't belong to anyone something concernsüò¥.</p>
<p>This casino wants to make it clear to you that something so impossible is something I have never experienced before.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I come to the final bill, after the money was credited back to my balance again and again after 3 weeks, I was at my wits' end. Yes, they probably had me where they wanted to see me, I have the ‚Ç¨3,500 ultimately playful.</p>
<p>Today I admit it, as time heals wounds, I still haven't gotten over my anger üò¥üòÇ, it's the ultimate mockery, every experienced player will be able to understand that.</p>
<p>And even today I still don't understand why I was asked to pay out in 400‚Ç¨ shares, I never got a clear answer to my question, and I'm still very resentful about this casino, it's just disapproving , this way of dealing with the customer.</p>
<p>You no longer have trust, you are cheated, stalled and flooded with standardized answers that tell you everything but do not inform you about what is really going on.</p>
<p>It's a shame, you deposit, almost, safely, and without reservation, immediately, and of course you play to win when you deposit, and not to experience such things when you win a larger sum.</p>
<p>To raise the question of gambling addiction at all in such matters is an absolute mockery to the customer and should be prosecuted to the utmost, because it is precisely from these customers who regularly bet large sums that the casino earns money.</p>
<p>Any discussion that uses this question to discuss the matter, in relation to withheld winnings, refusal of payouts by a casino, etc., is completely illegitimate, irrelevant, superfluous and, above all, attempted misleading, in my opinion to the highest degree.</p>
<p>Even though in my case this type was never mentioned by a casino, but I have read about it so many times, in other cases, it is an absolutely baseless absurdity and an absolutely criminal approach for a casino to even plead with it Case by case.</p>
<p>So, for today, I've said enough, and I just want my story with Icecasino to be public here, and not to keep it from anyone.</p>
<p>I haven't deposited there since then, and suddenly I can't activate any bonuses anymore, or I think I claimed bonuses too often for their likingüòè, that's another kind of funny thing about Icecasino, but wow, sorry for today I've written enough.</p>
