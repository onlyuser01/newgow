    <h1>America S Largest Casino Hotels Near Kickapoo Casino Montbleu Resort Casino Spa Stateline Nv Rivers</h1>

<p>Itâ€™s the final week of the NFL regular season! Week 18 kicks off on Saturday, January 6, 2024, with the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Baltimore Ravens game at M&amp;T Bank Stadium</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens have secured the No. 1 seed in the American Football Conference (AFC). Theyâ€™ve done their job, unlike their AFC North rivals. The Pittsburgh Steelers are 9-7, but they still do have a chance to win a wild card entry to the position. For that, however, they need to beat the Ravens in Baltimore on Saturday.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh Steelers Going All-In on Saturday</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers need to win Saturdayâ€™s game, but even that isnâ€™t a guarantee that theyâ€™re going to make the playoffs. They need to see their rivals for the wild card entry fail a day later. Itâ€™s not very likely, but anything is possible in football.</p>
<p>That said, the Steelers have no other option but to go all-in against the Ravens. The bad news is that their AFL North foes are much, much better than them. However, theyâ€™ve already defeated them once this season. Back in October, the Steelers beat the Ravens 17-10.</p>
<p>Can they do it again? They might, especially because the Ravens might decide to take it easy on Saturday.</p>
<p>Will the Ravens Take It Easy in Week 18?</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Baltimore Ravens demolished the Miami Dolphins 56-19, thus getting to a 13-3 record on the season. Winning that game also meant securing the No. 1 seed in the AFC.</p>

<p>What this practically means is that Saturdayâ€™s game practically means nothing for them. Their only motivation could be to ruin their divisional rivalsâ€™ hopes of making the playoffs. Still, we donâ€™t think thatâ€™s good enough a reason for coach John Harbaugh to risk injuries of his key men.</p>
<p>There are already a couple of players who are struggling with fitness â€“ Marlon Humphrey, Brandon Stephens, Kyle Hamilton, Kevin Zeitler, and others â€“ and Harbaugh surely doesnâ€™t want to see more starters get on that list.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why we suspect heâ€™s going to give some backups a chance on Saturday, which, in turn, would reduce his teamâ€™s chances of winning. But you can be certain that Harbaugh and the Ravens donâ€™t care. After all, theyâ€™ve got playoffs to think about.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Baltimore Ravens Prediction</p>
<p>We think the Pittsburgh Steelers will win this game. It wonâ€™t be easy though, but we think they can labor a win. That said, weâ€™re not 100% certain that theyâ€™re going to cover the 4-point spread. What we do think is very likely is that the game wonâ€™t see too many points, probably not more than 36.5.</p>
<p>Picks: Pittsburgh Steelers &amp; Under 36.5 Points</p>
