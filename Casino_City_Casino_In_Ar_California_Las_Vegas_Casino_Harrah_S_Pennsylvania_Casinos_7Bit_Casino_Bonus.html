    <h1>Casino City Casino In Ar California Las Vegas Casino Harrah S Pennsylvania Casinos 7Bit Casino Bonus</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>One of your employees 'Laura' from the test department has contacted me regarding a post about my 22bet withdrawal issues stating she would be happy to help. She advised me to create a skrill account and told me the different steps to proceed in order to enable the withdrawal of my funds from 22 bet with skrill (money deposited by mastercard payment method initially)</p>
<p>I did everything she told me and said i would pay her 30€ to reward her if she would help getting my money back. I deposited money via skrill with paypal but i'm unable to deposit on 22 bet since the money isn't gambling money. (I deposited with paysafecard option) The check option for gambling is only available with deposits via VISA card and she said if I would send her an additionnal 15€ she would convert 15€ with her VISA card and wire to my skrill for me to withdrawal but she has been dishonest and keeps saying she never recieved the money when she clearly did. She contacted me out of the blue a few days ago for me to send her the money.</p>
<p>She probably does that to every desperate person on this forum. I have all proof of money sent and transaction record and e-mails asking me to send money to help when she knew she would keep it to her self. I aked her to send me the transaction record for that specific operation to give me proof she is saying the truth about not recieving but I know it is instant and i have sent her money before. She gave me a ton of excuses not to and is acting extremly defensive when I'm just trying to understand what happended.She has been ghosting me. She has been overly nice and suspicious and I decided to believe her as i've got 300€ to withdraw and it is a large sum of money for me.</p>
<p>I'm completely shocked and disgusted that has happened to me from your staff member.</p>
<p>This is clearly stealing and dishonesty. I will proceed and take action. My case has not been taken seriously and I've been stolen from your staff members...</p>
<p>I can send all aditionnal proof with no problem at all. I took screenshots and my record is clean on skrill. I did only 3 transactions counting 2 for her and skrill said the money has been sent and it is not lost. I have transaction number.</p>
