<p>Dubbed “The Perfect Storm,” the upcoming boxing bout between Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk, who remains undefeated in his professional career, will be one of the biggest fights to watch this year. AJ’s WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles will be the focal point of this fight, as Usyk will be walking into the ring on Saturday, September 25, in Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London, England.</p>
<p>Joshua, who is keen to fight Tyson Fury for the WBC title, will first have to overcome Usyk. The fight between him and the Gypsy King was canceled after Deontay Wilder won an arbitration case for an immediate rematch after Fury-Wilder 2. Now, it comes down to AJ taking out Usyk, who has not lost a single fight in his career.</p>
<p>Joshua could have waited and bade his time, but he has not shied away from a challenge taking on what is arguably a fighter who could end his career or, at the very least, set him back months in his hopes of facing off against Fury.</p>

<p>Tale of the Tape Anthony Joshua vs Oleksandr Usyk</p>
<p>Anthony Joshua Stats Oleksandr Usyk 24-1, 22 KOs Record 18-0, 13 KOs 6’6″ Height 6’3″ 82″ Reach 78″ 240.8 lbs (last fight) Weight 217 lbs (last fight)</p>
<p>What to Expect from AJ and Usyk</p>
<p>The upcoming fight is hard to be summarized in words. Joshua is posted as a strong favorite at (-265) as, other than a small upset to Andy Ruiz, he has been undefeated. He disposed of Kubrat Pulev in December 2020 and shut down an over-confident Bulgarian, who showed poor taste both before and during the fight.</p>
<p>AJ has given it a lot of thought, but his victory over Pulev gave him the confidence boost that he needed to take on Usyk while awaiting his much-coveted bout with Fury. Yet, Pulev is hardly Usyk, and so far as pound-for-pound fighters go, the Ukrainian is a different caliber altogether.</p>
<p>Joshua is coming in strong, with 24-1 and 22 KOs, and his finishing punches are what has decimated dozens of opponents. Not only that, but AJ has all the physical attributes to back him up. The man simply looms over Usyk as he sports the better height, reach and even pure punching power.</p>
<p>So, Has Usyk a Shot at Winning on Saturday?</p>
<p>Underestimating Usyk is definitely not wise. The man has achieved an 18-0 overall career record and has 13 KOs to his name. While Usyk will clearly have to fight a much bigger opponent, he is also keen on preserving his record intact.</p>
<p>Financial considerations are surely playing a part in his choice to fight Joshua, but there is also Usyk’s pride and desire to prove himself against what could be the best heavyweight fighter of our time in the face of AJ.</p>
<p>Usyk most recently took out Dereck Chisora by unanimous decision, and he defeated both Tony Bellew and Chazz Witherspoon in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Both fighters are actually pretty tough, and AJ hasn’t faced either of them.</p>
<p>We will have to judge Usyk’s performance on the night of the fight. He seems to be comfortable walking out against Joshua, and we have a feeling that AJ’s over-confidence may play him a mean trick just like he did with Andy Ruiz. There is no room for mistakes here because Usyk is not one to take kindly to those.</p>
<p>In the mood for a long-shot bet? Pick Usyk on the moneyline.</p>
