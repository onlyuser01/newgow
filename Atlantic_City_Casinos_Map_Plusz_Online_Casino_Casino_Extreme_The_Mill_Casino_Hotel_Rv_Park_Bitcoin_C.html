    <h1>Atlantic City Casinos Map Plusz Online Casino Casino Extreme The Mill Casino Hotel Rv Park Bitcoin C</h1>

<p>Dear Katrin,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’s closure? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gaming section on the website, and this is what I found https://westcasino.com/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>„Self-exclusion</p>
<p>If you feel that you may have lost control of your gambling, we also offer self-exclusion option which can be activated via email, as specified in the Terms and Conditions. You MUST state your wish to SELF-EXCLUDE and any such request will take effect within 24 hours from the moment of receipt of the request by our Support team. NOTE: Unless SELF-EXLCUSION has specifically been stated, your request will be treated as standard account closure as illustrated above and can therefore be reopened at any time during the selected period.</p>
<p>For additional information about how we treat self-exclusion such as potential closure of other accounts on sites managed and operated by the license holder, please visit the Terms and Conditions. During the period of self-exclusion, it will in most instances NOT be possible to reopen the account and any request to do so will automatically be rejected.</p>
<p>If you are considering self-exclusion, please consider contacting all gambling companies with whom you have accounts with and ask for to be self-excluded there as well. We also recommend installation of software that will allow you to block access to internet gambling websites. Filtering Systems can be found on the bottom of this page."</p>
<p>https://westcasino.com/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>"Self-exclusion - If you feel that you may have lost control of your gambling, we provide a self-exclusion facility which can be activated by contacting support@westcasino.com. Self-exclusion means that your account will remain closed during the entire exclusion period, which can be set for a minimum of 6 months. This is the major difference to a standard account closure request. Should you wish to activate permanent self-exclusion you may do so by contacting the above email address. Any funds remaining in your account/s, shall be immediately returned to You, with an applied deduction equivalent to the transaction processing fees."</p>
<p>Is this support@westcasino.com the email address you have sent your emails to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards, Petronela</p>
