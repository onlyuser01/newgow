    <h1>Casinos In Utah Vegas Casinos Online Casino Hotel In St Louis Casino Niagara Shoshone Bannock Casino</h1>

<p>Creator of state-of-the-art casino games based on innovation Stakelogic has partnered with Jelly, a promising development studio, to create and release a new King Arthur-based slot. Fortune of Camelot is a mid-volatility game packed with random wilds, stacked wilds, free spins, and a super stake. Stakelogic’s chief commercial officer Olga Bajela called the game an excellent example of what can be obtained when two studios collide. Bajela praised Jelly’s knowledge and interest in developing “games around fun themes” and delivering “a thrilling player experience.”</p>
<p>Fortune of Camelot Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Rows: 3</p>
<p>Paylines: 20</p>
<p>RTP: 95.84%</p>
<p>Hit Freq: 36%</p>
<p>Max Win: €433,600</p>
<p>Volatility: Medium</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0.20-800</p>
<p>“Great Addition” to Stakelogic’s Portfolio</p>
<p>Bajela also referred to Fortune of Camelot as an excellent addition to their portfolio of modern-day video slots. She also expressed eagerness to watch players get engaged in the adventure, grab their shields and swords, reach Camelot and start fighting for their fortune.</p>
<p>The action on the reels is highly engaging during the base game. However, when the three Scatter symbols are seen landing, they automatically trigger the Free Spins bonus round and bring more fun to the grid.</p>
<p>The game’s design is based on the iconic King Arthur legend, and elements of the Round Table and the Camelot castle have been used in a cartoonish style both on the grid and in the background. Players will come across popular figurines like Merlin the Wizard, King Arthur, and Sir Lancelot.</p>
<p>Upon setting foot into Camelot, players receive ten Free Games. Provided a minimum of four to five Scatter symbols are seen, they will trigger the bonus. Players can expect an extra x100 or x200 multiplier. In case the Golden Wild is seen landing while engaged in the Free Spins round, the total Win Multiplier goes up.</p>
<p>Discover Stacked Wilds and Merlin’s Magic</p>
<p>While playing the base game, a player can trigger a random Wild Modifier during any given spin using Merlin’s Magic. When this occurs, an eye-catching Modifier animation is seen taking over the screen, marking the fact that the Modifier is engaged while revealing the Wild symbols. Next, the reels are put into motion.</p>
<p>Seeing Stacked Wilds being triggered on random spins with the help of Merlin’s magic will attract bigger wins. The Super Stake enables players to double the size of their bets for a double chance of hitting the Free Spins bonus.</p>
<p>At the end of September, Stakelogic announced it would launch its content with Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino in Belgium. A similar deal was sealed with Soft2Bet during the same month.</p>
