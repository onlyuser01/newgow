    <h1>Casinos In Cali Raging Bull Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Menominee Casino Resort Casino Pittsburgh</h1>

<p>Hello and thank you in advance for your cooperation.</p>
<p>When taking first deposit bonus, I have subscribed to another bonus too - this claims to provide 10 freespins for each 20â‚¬ wagered up to 100 spins. (I doublechecked with support that told me</p>
<p>it is perfectly legit to profit of them both at the same time).</p>
<p>I played quite long, wagered much more than 200 eur - I was eligible to receive all 100 freespins. However I received only 10 freespins.</p>
<p>I was sure this is gonna be solved easily - but it was not. I have been told to wait, because the issue is transferred to bonus dept, and that I will be contacted via email.</p>
<p>I waited, day or two. It was workweek that time, I was sure that they must have forgotten about it, so I contacted them again, and got the same response.</p>
<p>Then again and again ...after a week I realized, that this casino is "Rich" only by its name.</p>
<p>However, today I was irresistible and finally got this response:</p>
<p>"...The relevant team confirmed that you haven't be able to receive the bonus as the free spins are credited automatically based on wagering requirements and wagering contributions of different games.</p>
<p>In this case, we can give you a deposit bonus of 100% for any inconvenience due to the issue of receiving the bonus."</p>
<p>(it's a pity that players need to teach casinos, that it's low manner behavior, offering deposit bonuses while taking away earned free bonuses. I read entire terms &amp; conditions and there isn't single word about any decrease in contribution to the wagering for the games I played, just only like 10 slot games I haven't ever played)</p>
<p>So, after more than a week of repeatedly asking for resolution I got this. I am sure that everyone, who has been in touch with live chat at least few times knows, that this response is just diplomatic gibberish - mere empty words hiding the scrooge of the casino.</p>
<p>TLDR: No, this isn't another several-thousand-withdrawal-denied complaint.</p>
<p>Despite that I think the message is clear - do you want to risk your money in such casino, proving being unfair and refusing to take responsibility for the loss they caused, even when it's all about such TINY AMOUNT? Moreover, those 90 freespins were well-deserved, not even close to signup free bonus or similar ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this novel and thanks in advance for your following effort.</p>
