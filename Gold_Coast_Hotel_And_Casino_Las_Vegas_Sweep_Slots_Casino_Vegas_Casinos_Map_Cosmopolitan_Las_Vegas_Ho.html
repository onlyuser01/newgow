<p>Casino Guru has drawn the name of this year’s Best Christmas Slot 2022 raffle contest winner. The draw took place on Wednesday, December 27, and saw one of the hundreds of participants take home the prize, an Amazon Voucher worth $100 or a currency equivalent.</p>
<p>The winner, the forum user by the handle of berndrondholz04, won against all odds and against 904 participants. The final draw was recorded and published by Casino Guru on YouTube to guarantee the impartiality of the process.</p>
<p>As to the Best Christmas Slot 2022 raffle, the event focused on voting one of six available slots as the best holiday game for the season. The games included Christmas Carol Megaways by Pragmatic Play, Ho Ho Tower by ELK Studios, Fat Santa by Push Gaming, Santa’s Stack by Relax Gaming, Xmas Joker by Play’n GO, and Stay Frosty! by Betsoft Gaming.</p>
<p>The games were made available for free on the Casino Guru website so that players could play them before casting their votes in the forum contest. Casino Guru was happy to award the winner at random regardless of which the winning game was in the end.</p>
<p>In this instance, Casino Guru forum users found Christmas Carol Megaways to be the most popular game and slot with an overwhelming share of the votes putting the final count at 507. The second-best game came by Play’n GO which saw Xmas Joker collect 176 of votes.</p>
<p>In line with the ethical guidelines of Casino Guru, all contests are run by the company and not sponsored by any third parties. Casino Guru also prohibits full-time consultants to enter the race, although external casino testers are free to participate and win.</p>
<p>Casino Guru is happy to have wrapped the year with another opportunity to reward and engage with its audiences. With New Year’s Eve now looming, Casino Guru is looking toward 2023 with a mix of trepidation and excitement about the upcoming forum contests that will be revealed during the new year.</p>
