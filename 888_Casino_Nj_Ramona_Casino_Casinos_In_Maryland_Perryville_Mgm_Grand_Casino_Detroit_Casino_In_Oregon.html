<p>Ahead of the transfer of the fourth National Lottery license, the company extended its partnership, agreeing to continue to supply the Lottery with its leading technology</p>
<p>The leading provider of technology, powering lotteries across the globe, International Game Technology (IGT), announced an important partnership extension. On Wednesday, the company confirmed it agreed to extend its contract for the provision of its lottery system for the UK National Lottery.</p>
<p>The announcement comes ahead of the switch of the Lottery license from Camelot to Allwyn, scheduled for the start of next month. As a result, IGT will continue to power the National Lottery with its leading technology and solutions, paving the way for the successful transformation under the management of Allwyn.</p>
<p>Camelot was the operator of the Lottery for the last three decades since its first draw in 1994. However, ahead of the expiry of Camelot’s license, the UK gambling regulator, the Gambling Commission, selected Allwyn as a holder of the fourth Lottery license. This prompted IGT to launch a lawsuit against the regulator, pursuing damages. In an unexpected turn of events, last week, IGT discontinued its National Lottery-related appeal, effectively abandoning the damages it previously pursued from the regulator.</p>
<p>The extended collaboration with the Lottery isn’t a surprise, considering that IGT has a growing portfolio of lottery partners across the globe. In fact, the company currently serves as the main provider of technology for 25 lotteries across the United States and eight out of the top 10 largest lotteries around the world.</p>
<p>The Partnership Extension Brings Excitement for IGT</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, IGT’s COO of global lottery, revealed that the company is excited to extend its support for the National Lottery in the UK. Moreover, he spoke about the importance of collaborating with Allwyn, as well as other suppliers in the sector.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to continue to support the operation of The National Lottery, working alongside a range of other suppliers and Allwyn.“ Jay Gendron, COO of global lottery at IGT</p>
<p>This week, John Tanner, the executive director for the 4th National Lottery Competition, predicted that the transfer of the Lottery license is expected to boost the funding toward Good Causes. For more than three decades, the Lottery has been actively raising money for Good Causes with the sum now surpassing £47 billion ($59.4 billion).</p>
