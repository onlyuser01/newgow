    <h1>Coushatta Casino Louisiana Harrah S Casino Las Vegas Strip Hard Rock Casino Seminole Way Fort Lauder</h1>

<p>Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment has been awarded third-party accreditation for Responsible Gambling by RG Check. The accreditation was given to the casino operator's Cyprus Casinos (C2) arm, one of a group in the country that includes the upcoming integrated resort City of Dreams Mediterranean (CODM).</p>
<p>The endorsement reportedly makes C2 the first European casino to be granted this accreditation. Melco is now the only integrated resort operator worldwide to be accredited by RG Check in all of its operations. All four C2 venues – in Limassol, Nicosia, Ayia Napa and Paphos – have been granted accreditation.</p>
<p>Responsible gaming is closely tied to Melco’s commitment to the safety and wellbeing of the community. Melco exceeds all regulatory requirements in all of its jurisdictions and strives for continuous improvement to ensure fair and safe gaming experiences for all guests.</p>
<p>C2's RG Check certification is a sign of Melco's commitment towards responsible gaming in all its global operations. The Company was first to be certified by RG Check in Macau and the Philippines earlier this year.</p>
<p>Melco's entire global portfolio including Altira Macau and City of Dreams Macau, as well as Studio City and City of Dreams Manila and now Cyprus's C2 are all accredited by RG Check. This makes Melco the only operator to have RG Check certifications for its entire portfolio of operations in Macau and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Melco's Chairman and CEO, Lawrence Ho said that Melco is committed to being an industry leader in responsible gaming. The Company's core commitment to society is to continue providing fair and safe gaming experiences for its guests. He added, "The sustainable development and continued implementation of a Responsible Gaming culture is prioritized within every jurisdiction that we operate. We wish to thank the RG Check organizers for the honor, and our colleagues in Cyprus for making this achievement possible."</p>
<p>Shelley White, the CEO of the Responsible Gambling Council (RGC), pointed out that this is the third time Melco has been awarded RG Check Accreditation. She said the company had "demonstrated its transparency as an operator and has made duty of care a priority in its operations. In particular, we commend Melco on a best in class score in the Standard Areas of RG Policy, Strategy and Culture."</p>
<p>RG Check is a valuable tool to manage risk and increase the effectiveness of RG programs. It is the most rigorous and comprehensive responsible gaming accreditation program in the world. It meets or exceeds all responsible gaming regulations established by regulators and is valid for three years. An independent panel of responsible gambling specialists reviews the application for accreditation.</p>
