    <h1>My Choice Casino Com Casinos Near Oklahoma City Casino S Near Me Rio All Suite Hotel And Casino Las</h1>

<p>Can you provide me with this evidence? You say it will remain documented internally? I think it’s only right you share these results with the person it pertains to (me). You keep stating you have it then it should be easy to give me that proof. I want more than words. That’s what I have been asking for and you won’t provide it. Why? Without this proof it’s just words. I can claim I am the strongest man in the world. Then when people ask me to prove it I just say. "I can assure you I am the strongest man in the world. I internally have proof". Or in a trial evidence is needed. "Your honor this man is guilty. I have evidence in my personal files and take my word then hold him accountable but no I will not share it". This is basically the same type of absurdity you’re claiming . If you don’t want to provide proof publicly then send it to me privately. Show me that all activity was on the same device. I know this can’t be the case and want to see actual proof. If you can’t share it with anyone then nobody can verify what you say is true and it’s highly suspicious. I’m honestly not expecting you to give me a cent. You have made that clear. I doubt I would have gotten a cent from you regardless. It’s not even about the money to me anymore. It’s about having the money disappear and then I’m told I’m a liar. Not only privately but publicly. You would always find a way not to pay. The money is written off but I would still love to see this "evidence" that you supposedly keep in your internal files but won’t show to anyone, including the person it affects. NOBODY should deposit on this site if you ever want to see a dime via withdrawal. It’s lost the second you deposit even if you happen to win. There is a reason they are rated 4/10 here and even worse or blacklisted on other sites.</p>
