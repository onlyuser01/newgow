<p>On Tuesday, May 23, 2023, the Miami Heat have a chance to seal the deal and win the Eastern Conference</p>
<p>What’s going on with the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals? They lost two games on their turf, followed by an embarrassing 128-102 loss in the first game played in Miami. Game 4 too is played in Florida and oddsmakers think we could see the Heat win again.</p>

<p>Miami Heat Playing Incredible Basketball Right Now</p>
<p>Who would’ve thought that the Miami Heat would do so well in the first three games of the Eastern Conference Finals? They entered the series as underdogs, but then totally demolished the Celtics. In the first two games of the series – both played at TD Garden in Boston – Jimmy Butler led the Heat to win.</p>

<p>However, in Game 3, the boys from Miami held a masterclass on team play. They played as a collective, with 11 of their players scoring at least a point. And six of those scored double figures, with Vincent Gabe being the scoring leader with 29 points.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing about Miami’s performance in Game 3 is that these guys played wonderful defensively. They managed to keep the Celtics to just 102 points that evening. Boston’s Jayson Tatum – whose PPG in the regular season was 30.1 – scored just 14 points.</p>
<p>Are Boston Celtics Too Down to Do Anything?</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the Boston Celtics locker room just can’t be great. They entered the Eastern Conference Finals as favorites but are now 3-0 down. No one expected it, but no one can say they deserved better. The Heat player completely outplayed them in each of the playoff games.</p>
<p>Jayson Tatum scored a lot of points in the first two games, but in Game 3, we did not see much from him. The same goes for all the other Boston players, who just seemed anemic on the court. The biggest problem was that they missed too many shots, especially in the most recent game.</p>
<p>Their defense wasn’t at a high level either, which is kind of surprising because they were brilliant defensively in the regular season.</p>
<p>Boston Celtics vs Miami Heat Prediction</p>
<p>The Celtics just don’t look like a team that could pull off a comeback. They’re 3-0 down, and some of their players seem as if they’ve already given up. Further, the Heat players look fired up to grab another big win.</p>
<p>Pick: Miami Heat to win and cover the spread</p>
