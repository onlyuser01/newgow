<p>First-ranked UFC Featherweight champion Max Holloway has inked a historical partnership deal with streaming platform Kick, becoming the first MMA artist to officially join them</p>
<p>After ranking first in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Featherweight category in July and becoming the second-ranked UFC artist in men’s pound-for-pound rankings in September, Max “Blessed” Holloway has fresh and exciting news on the horizon.</p>
<p>The five-times UFC title winner who describes himself as a “proud husband, daddest man on the Planet” and calls himself the “best boxer in the UFC” on his social media has recently inked a historical deal with popular streaming platform Kick.com.</p>
<p>Holloway, the First MMA Artist to Officially Join Kick</p>
<p>While the UFC legend is no stranger to the community-driven gaming and live-streaming platform founded in October 2022, the partnership marks the news that he will be now joining them as an official partner.</p>
<p>Between 2020-2021, the pro fighter engaged his audience while streaming his Call of Duty Warzone gameplay while also proving his burning passion for games like Grand Theft Auto and EA Sports UFC every time he was given the chance.</p>
<p>Now, he is expected to bring his expertise to the table by streaming a wide array of content that will include Fortnite, Apex Legends, UFC 5, and Madden.</p>
<p>His first official stream as one of the freshest Kick Partners was broadcast on November 17, during which one of the premier strikers in his sport played Apex Legends, answered questions from his subscribers and chat members and did fan giveaways.</p>
<p>Holloway, “So Excited to Join the Kick Community”</p>
<p>The fighter, who, during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience in 2019, explained that he had learned some of his fighting moves while engaged in the EA Sports UFC game, expressed his excitement for joining the Kick community.</p>
<p>He also praised the “functionality and sense of community” on the platform calling it an upgrade while announcing he was eager to start building and growing alongside the Kick family.</p>
<p>“Blessed,” who claims playing the UFC game has helped him better “grasp an opponent’s style, particularly given his rare practice of watching fights,” will be streaming over 10 hours a week on the platform that takes gambling concerns and view-botting seriously, or as often as his MMA training schedule will allow him to do it.</p>
<p>The fighter is expected to go back to the UFC Octagon at the beginning of 2024.</p>
<p>Kick’s chief marketing officer, Akhil Sarin, spoke about Holloway’s reputation “for being the best boxer in UFC” while also expressing their excitement regarding the impact he will have on the platform, considering the high interest and engagement that his initial streams attracted.</p>
<p>In September, the UFC announced partnering with pioneering sports betting compliance solution, ProhiBet, as a means of reinforcing regulatory compliance and fighting off prohibited activities regarding sports bets.</p>
