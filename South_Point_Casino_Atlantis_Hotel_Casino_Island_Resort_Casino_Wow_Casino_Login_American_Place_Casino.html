    <h1>South Point Casino Atlantis Hotel Casino Island Resort Casino Wow Casino Login American Place Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Halil,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience, but please understand, that 72 hours is quite a short time period. In many casinos, it takes even weeks to fully process a withdrawal.</p>
<p>Since you were impatient, and you’ve lost all your winnings, there is nothing we can do. We believe, that if you lost your winnings farily, you have no right for a deposit refund even if you were from a restricted country. We investigate further and help only those players, whose funds (or winnings) have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country, which, sadly, isn’t your case here. And this is in accordance with our policy. You can read about it in our Fair Gambling Codes https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries:</p>
<p>"If the casino allows a player from a restricted country to play because it hasn't implemented this check, it should accept that it was the casino's mistake and pay out all winnings to the player despite the fact that they shouldn't have been allowed to play in the first place, provided that the player hasn't done anything else that's against the rules."</p>
<p>Additionally, I would like to point out, that when we calculate the casino’s rating, we don’t take into consideration the length of the withdrawal process.</p>
<p>Please, if there is anything else, we could help you with, do not hesitate to contact us, otherwise, we will reject this complaint. Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristína</p>
