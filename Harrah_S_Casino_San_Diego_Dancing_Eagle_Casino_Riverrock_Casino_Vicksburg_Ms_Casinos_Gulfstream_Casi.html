<p>Andy Ventris, a rising talent in the gambling industry, has accepted the offer to join Clarion Gaming as the company’s new event director. With this appointment, Ventris will be responsible for the ICE London brand.</p>
<p>Ventris Recognized the Fact ICE London Is a Massive Brand</p>
<p>Shortly after taking part in the ICE ECA Summer Symposium at central London’s Les Ambassadeurs Club on July 13, Ventris stated that “ICE London is a formidable brand,” one that every event organizer is dreaming of working on.</p>
<p>That is the reason why he’s delighted to join the team and work with clients to deliver top-tier results and help the brand grow with his insight and events knowledge. As a concluding matter, Ventris stated that the Summer Symposium was a great opportunity for him to meet some of the biggest leaders in the casino industry just days after joining Clarion.</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming’s managing director, Stuart Hunter, also shared a few words on Ventris’ appointment. He stated that Ventris has had a successful career as he worked with numerous brands across five continents.</p>
<p>Before joining Clarion, Ventris was the director of the London Book fair, where he was in charge of the brand’s global strategy. This is something that Hunter acknowledged and stated that the challenges that await ICE are somewhat similar to the challenges that Ventris had with the London Book Fair.</p>
<p>While concluding his statement, Hunter stated that Ventris has “an entrepreneurial spirit” and that he’s happy to welcome him to the team as preparations for ICE London 2023 are underway.</p>
<p>ICE London 2023 Is Already 85% Booked</p>
<p>The 2023 edition of ICE London will take place on February 7-9 and is set to get the event back on track after several brands withdrew from the 2022 edition due to the COVID-19 restrictions. Hunter confirmed that 85% of the available stand space is already booked and the demand has been driven by a positive experience.</p>
<p>He stated that Clarion always sets demanding targets when it comes to customer engagement and added that these targets have been surpassed. A vast number of the exhibitors that attended the 2022 edition re-booked their presence and even requested additional space.</p>
<p>ICE London 2022 had a total of 410 exhibitors from 59 countries, many of which were reputable brands in the casino industry – European Casino Association, Gaming Regulators European Forum, the Danish Online Gambling Association, Gamstop, Global Gaming Women, International Masters of Gaming Law, etc.</p>
<p>Per Jaldung, the chairman of the European Casino Association, welcomed the return of the event in February 2023 and stated that ICE is “pivotal” to the post-COVID recovery of the land-based sector and added that ECA is working with Clarion on a new ”program of symposia” for the suppliers.</p>
