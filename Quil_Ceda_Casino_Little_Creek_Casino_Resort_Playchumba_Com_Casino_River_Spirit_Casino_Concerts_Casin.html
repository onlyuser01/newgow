<p>Yggdrasil’s Viking-themed slots have turned into flagship games that have driven the company’s growth since 2015 when Vikings Go Wild was launched. The saga continued with Vikings Go Berzerk in 2016, accompanied by Vikings Go To Hell in 2018, and the Vikings Go Berzerk Reloads sequel in 2021. This spring, Yggdrasil has decided to keep the story going by launching Vikings Go To Valhalla on March 28.</p>
<p>Vikings Go To Valhalla In Their Biggest Battle Yet</p>
<p>The new game is a high volatility game with a theoretical RTP of 96%. It introduces players to the mighty Vikings who need to offer their protection to the Hall of Heroes’ characters as they are under siege. The world of Asgard needs a savior from the evils of the Snake King Jörmungandr himself, so get ready for some action-packed reels with eye-catching graphics and adrenaline-pumping events.</p>
<p>The game displays a series of captivating interactive features and it can even trigger some giant wins in the Ragnarök Free Spins round. Just remember to keep a close eye on the ruthless king always looming nearby and do your best to join mighty Gunnar and his army of courageous Vikings ready to give their all to keep Asgard safe and unharmed.</p>
<p>Keep a close eye on the Rage Meter as you never know when it could bring you 20 free spins, loads of respins, and even giant rewards during the Ragnarök Free Spins. The new game also comes with a spectacular max win set at x23,210, compliments of the boldest Vikings in the Scandinavian land.</p>
<p>Special Symbols and Bonus Modes</p>
<p>During the base game, players must build as many rage points as they can and trigger the rewarding Berzerker mode. To gather rage points, players must come across winning combos that feature a Viking symbol. Once one of the warrior’s meters is full, the player will receive Berzerk respins. During the respins, the Vikings on the reels will engage in ferocious battles against Jörmungandr. Each successful battle will transform them into sticky wilds. The Berzerk respins mode will come to an end once no more fights can be won after a spin.</p>
<p>Players receive additional rewards during the game. For instance, once a treasure chest lands on the last reel during any game mode, players are rewarded with special prizes. Coming across at least three Scatter symbols will activate the Free Spins round with a dedicated respins feature. This feature will guarantee the presence of a series of modifiers, including Wild Reels, Wilds, and Berzerk Vikings.</p>
<p>To finish off the Free Spins round, the Ragnarök Wheel will be triggered. Once it will stop on a golden area, the player will get to step into the next round. A player who manages to land on golden segments during all six rounds enters the Ragnarök Free Spins mode. In some jurisdictions, players can buy any of the three bonus modes.</p>
<p>As popular as its Viking saga may be, Yggdrasil periodically releases other titles with a variety of different themes. At the end of February, Yggdrasil and Jade Rabbit released Steam Spin, an adventure-themed 3×3 slot. Last October, Yggdrasil and G Games released a jungle-themed slot called Tiger Tiger.</p>
