<p>Playson, a leading iGaming supplier of content and games, has expanded its reach with German operator PlatinCasino. Through this partnership, Playson will seek to consolidate its offer in the German market while at the same time offering PlatinCasino a significant boost to its overall portfolio of available products.</p>
<p>Playson Launches Games with PlatinCasino</p>
<p>Playson will launch a number of its leading content propositions, including Royal Coins: Hold and Win, Book del Sol: Multiplier, and Joker’s Coins: Hold and Win. PlatinCasino is also an important entry because of its size and reaches in the German market. The brand already offers a number of excellent products, such as slots, live casinos, and table games.</p>
<p>Playson is continuing to improve on its position in Europe through the German market, as it’s one of the most important jurisdictions presently. Playson sales director Blanka Honor said that the company was thrilled to be jumping into this partnership together with PlatinCasino, a company that she described as one of the major players in the market.</p>
<p>Thanks to this collaboration, Playson will continue to have a strong presence in the region and deliver on player expectations. “As the online market in Germany begins to take off, we feel this partnership will only grow in significance – giving us the opportunity to benefit from a promising jurisdiction for years to come,” Blanka said.</p>
<p>Playson has been very active of late. The company appointed Oleksandr Rudenko as its new head of platform and launched slot games with Inbet in June. A bit part of the company’s efforts will lie in growth across key markets, including Europe, Nikolay Illiustrov, head of games at Playson, confirmed in an interview for GamblingNews last month.</p>
<p>Previously, PlatinCasino launched games by both Nolimit City, now an Evolution company, and BGaming.</p>
