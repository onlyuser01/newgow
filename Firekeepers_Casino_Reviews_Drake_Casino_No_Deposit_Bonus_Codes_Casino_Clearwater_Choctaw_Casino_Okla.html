<p>Since it underwent reregulation, the Greek market has been an attractive destination for iGaming companies of all sizes. Push Gaming, an innovative supplier known for games such as Wizard Shop, The Shadow Order, and Jammin’ Jars 2, is now entering an important European destination.</p>
<p>This is possible through a local tie-up with Kaizen Gaming, a powerhouse in the Greek gambling market which will provide the supplier with access to new audiences. Besides the abovementioned games, players will also have access to other popular options, such as Razor Shark and Rat King.</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s entry into Greece comes on the tail of a similarly important milestone for the company with its entry into Italy earlier this year. This entry also comes shortly after LeoVegas Group has officially confirmed the finalization of the supplier’s acquisition.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest developments, Push Gamin Director of New Business and Markets Fiona Hickey said that the entire company was excited to top off its Italian market entry with the sequential move in Greece.</p>
<p>"Establishing ourselves with the largest gaming operator in the jurisdiction is a testament to the phenomenal success and global recognition our titles have accrued," she added.</p>
<p>Hickey explained that Push Gaming has been able to build a successful microcosm of titles with all products enjoying a strong reception by players and added that the supplier was definitely looking forward to deploying its future releases with Kaizen Gaming and in Greece.</p>
<p>As to Kaizen Gaming, Director of Product, Gaming &amp; Rewards Vangelis Dedoulis added that the company was excited to see Push Gaming’s excellent-quality titles become a part of the supplier’s library. It’s a delight to see the company join forces with Kaizen, Dedoulis said, and spoke highly of the opportunity to see the operator’s library enhanced by a rich new brand of games.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Push Gaming has been working hard round-the-clock to form a number of prominent alliances with some of the world’s leading iGaming companies. Recently, the supplier teamed up with Betway to strengthen the operator’s global library and content diversity.</p>
<p>A similar partnership was established earlier in the year with bet365, another leading operator with a significant market reach and global pull. In the Netherlands, the supplier has inked a content agreement with 711, one of the leading brands in the regulated market. As new opportunities emerge, Push Gaming continues to pounce on them, seeking to grow its expertise and understanding.</p>
