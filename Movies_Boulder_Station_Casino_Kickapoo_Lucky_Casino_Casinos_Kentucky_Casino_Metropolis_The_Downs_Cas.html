    <h1>Movies Boulder Station Casino Kickapoo Lucky Casino Casinos Kentucky Casino Metropolis The Downs Cas</h1>

<p>I am getting the run around when requesting to withdraw my balance of $7000. I have already waited 9 days before requesting the withdraw as per their policy concerning card deposits.</p>
<p>I got a head start and sent in KYC documents to help speed the process up. This is my first time requesting a withdraw, However I have made previous bitcoin deposits.</p>
<p>After reading there reviews and doing a little research I am very nervous and on Edge. Based on there reputation, I think its very likely I will not see a dime of those winnings.</p>
<p>I reached out earlier, they said a phone call verification was needed. Of course I never received one.</p>
<p>I messaged again via chat, the story changed of course, now its my bank statement. They claim its not legible. So I sent them a water bill instead.</p>
<p>Still waiting to hear back at this point, I just figured I would get ahead of the game and file my complaint with you guys because my gut instinct just tells me this casino is unscrupulous</p>
