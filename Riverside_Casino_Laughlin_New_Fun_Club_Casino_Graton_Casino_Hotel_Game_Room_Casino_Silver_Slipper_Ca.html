<p>March Madness Odds Favor Virginia and Villanova, 24 Million People Expected to Fill Out Brackets</p>

<p>The 68-team bracket is set, but March Madness odds show that bettors believe only a handful of teams have a realistic shot at scoring the men’s basketball NCAA national championship.</p>

<p>Virginia and Villanova are the two heavy favorites, and Las Vegas oddsmakers have them in a league of their own. But sportsbooks are having a difficult time deciding which team is best positioned to win the title.</p>
<p>MGM sportsbooks have Virginia the favorite at 4/1. After winning the ACC title over North Carolina, the 31-2 Cavaliers are the overall #1 seed in the entire tournament.</p>
<p>However, the NCAA tournament committee didn’t do the Cavaliers any favors in the South Region.</p>
<p>To reach the Final Four in San Antonio, Virginia will need to emerge from a region that has four of the seven major conference champions. In addition to the Cavaliers winning the ACC, the South includes conference winners #2 Cincinnati (AAC, 30-4), #4 Arizona (Pac-12, 27-7), and Kentucky (SEC, 24-10).</p>
<p>The potentially difficult road to the Final Four for the #1 overall seed might be why some other sportsbooks feel ‘Nova has the best chances of being the last team standing.</p>
<p>The Big East winners are a #1 seed (East Region) for the third time in four years. The 2015-16 NCAA National Champions are the favorites for this year’s tourney at the Westgate SuperBook at 7/2.</p>
<p>Westgate confirmed it took multiple bets on Virginia preseason at 100/1. At those long odds, even a $10 bet would net the fortunate gambler $1,000. However, Arizona and Michigan State seem to be a worst-case scenario for the SuperBook, as those teams account for the most money wagered and most bets placed at the casino.</p>
<p>Rejecting the Field</p>
<p>Aside from Virginia and Villanova, there are only a few other teams that bettors believe have any realistic chance at cutting down nets.</p>
<p>Behind the Cavaliers and Wildcats, MGM’s March Madness odds has Duke (7/1) ahead of #1 seeds Kansas (10/1) and Xavier (12/1). Michigan State and Cincinnati are also currently at 12/1.</p>
<p>After those handful of teams trailing the favorites, the line moves to 15/1 for Purdue and Arizona, then 20/1 for UNC and Michigan.</p>
<p>At FiveThirtyEight, statistician Nate Silver’s website, Virginia has an 18 percent chance of winning the title, and Villanova has a 17 percent chance. Only five other teams have a five percent or greater chance. They are Duke (10 percent), Kansas (7 percent), Michigan State (6 percent), and UNC and Purdue (5 percent).</p>
<p>Big (Illegal) Money</p>
<p>Gambling on sports is mostly illegal in the US, but that won’t stop an estimated $10 billion from being wagered on the NCAA tournament. According to the American Gaming Association, 97 percent will be bet illegally.</p>
<p>As for those fun office pools, when money is involved they’re illegal too in 37 of 50 states. ESPN gambling writer David Purdum reports from The Mellman Group, a DC-based opinion research firm, that some 24 million people participated in a tournament pool last year, and filled out roughly 60 million brackets.</p>
