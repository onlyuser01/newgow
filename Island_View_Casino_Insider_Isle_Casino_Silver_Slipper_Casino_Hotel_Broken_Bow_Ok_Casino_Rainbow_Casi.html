    <h1>Island View Casino Insider Isle Casino Silver Slipper Casino Hotel Broken Bow Ok Casino Rainbow Casi</h1>

<p>1×2 Network is strengthening its expertise in the slot segment by adding a well-seasoned veteran who will help the company steer its products, reach new audiences, and generally improve on its offer.</p>
<p>Alex Ratcliffe to Lead Data-Driven Production</p>
<p>To this end, 1×2 Network has chosen Alex Ratcliffe, a former Entain head of slots, who will now join as the company’s new chief product officer. Commenting on the appointment, 1×2 Network CEO Kevin Redi said:</p>
<p>Alex is an incredibly talented, highly skilled product specialist and to be able to bring someone of his calibre into 1X2 Network is a key moment for the business as we look to embark on the next phase of our success journey.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe will be tasked with a number of responsibilities, including market and product, as well as collaborating with the company’s 1×2 Gaming and Iron Dog Studio teams. The two studios are 1×2 Network’s dedicated in-house game developers who make games such as Branded Megaways happen in the first place.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe will be expected to leverage his expertise and knowledge of big data in order to improve the decision-making process and take an analytical approach towards better-informed choices that result in sustained growth for the company.</p>
<p>Good Opportunity to Help 1×2 Network Excel</p>
<p>Ratcliffe welcomed the opportunity to be joining the company and drive its product forward:</p>
<p>The opportunity to help drive its studios forwards and to deliver great experiences to players was one that I could not turn down and I look forward to hitting the ground running with the various teams that I will be working with across the business.</p>
<p>1×2 Network is also hoping that Ratcliffe’s 2.5-year experience at Entain has honed his skills further, enabling him to better grasp the changes and evolution in the gambling market and what consumers expect from slots these days. He has held numerous additional B2B and B2C positions as well, all of which should help him fit well in 1×2 Network’s company culture and help it achieve its ultimate goal.</p>
