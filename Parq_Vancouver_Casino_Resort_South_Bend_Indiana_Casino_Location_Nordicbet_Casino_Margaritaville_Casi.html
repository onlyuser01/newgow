    <h1>Parq Vancouver Casino Resort South Bend Indiana Casino Location Nordicbet Casino Margaritaville Casi</h1>

<p>I played with their welcome bonus and ended up with around 4300 euro after the bonus wagering was cleared. They do have a max win limit of 1500 euro for the welcome bonus that I was aware of while playing and my balance dropped to 1500 euro when I made the last spin of the wagering. It felt bad seeing the balance drop like that, but rules are rules so that is not what this complaint is about.</p>
<p>I tried to withdraw my 1500 euro but they declined and said I still have to wager the initial deposit 3 times, After doing this I ended up with 1385 euro and tried to withdraw again.</p>
<p>I uploaded the standard documents normally needed for a withdrawal but later received an email demanding more documents. They wanted "additional state document" and I did not really understand what this was so I asked them what they wanted and they told me they needed a birth certificate or a foreign passport. At this point I started to question if this was a joke or something. Why would I have a foreign passport? Or a birth certificate, is that really something most people have at home?</p>
<p>I did at this point order a document of verification from my government but it takes some time to receive it and I did not get it in time before the casino closed my account. Because that is what they did yesterday, they closed my account and sent back my initial deposit of 100 euro. They are claiming bonus abuse all of a sudden and not giving any more detailed information than that.</p>
<p>It is very strange that they engaged in a 2 week long verification process with me before closing my account on a totally different reason. And I did not abuse any bonus rules, I am sure of that. It feels like they are just making up excuses to steal legitimate winnings from their customers.</p>
<p>I am claiming the missing 1285 euro.</p>
