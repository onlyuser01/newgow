<p>The tipline will allow athletes, coaches, staff and others involved with sports to anonymously report gambling-related abuse</p>
<p>Betting activity monitoring company, US Integrity, and the agency promoting accountability and trust for athletic organizations, RealResponse, announced today they have joined forces to enable athletes, trainers, coaches and support staff to anonymously report gambling-related issues in real-time.</p>
<p>Empowering the Voice of Athletes, Coaches and Staff</p>
<p>The partnership between US Integrity and RealResponse launched the “Athlete Alert Powered by RealResponse” tipline which is seen as an anonymous means of reporting gambling-related physical threats, harm, and emotional abuse sports people endure from fans.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, RealResponse founder and chief executive officer, David Chadwick, outlined the ease of use of the tipline and the key role it is expected to play in empowering sports people to have their voices heard.</p>
<p>Athlete Alert Powered by RealResponse is simple and easy to use and it confidentially elevates the voice of professional and student-athletes and the others who are the closest to competition. David Chadwick, CEO &amp; founder, RealResponse</p>
<p>Chadwick is confident that tools like the new tipline “in the hands of participants and competitors” serve to protect and enhance the integrity of sports all while providing for anonymity and safety.</p>
<p>Accessible via texting to 843-USI-TIPS (843-874-7477), the tipline will also create a safe place for athletes, coaches and staff to share their experiences, information related to corruption, as well as integrity-related concerns, including misuse of insider information, match-fixing, game manipulation, and illegal wagering.</p>
<p>Responsible for Ensuring Their Protection</p>
<p>US Integrity co-founder and chief executive officer, Matthew Holt, also commented on the partnership and the launch of the new reporting tool, adamant that “nothing is more important than the health and wellbeing of the professional and student-athletes who have committed their lives to compete at the highest levels,” and it’s the job of organizations like US Integrity to ensure protection.</p>
<p>“The implementation of Athlete Alert Powered by RealResponse is another example of how we help our partners to stay one step ahead of any bad actors,” Holt said, pointing out that a single text sent to the tipline “can help limit and prevent acts or threats of physical and emotional harm or intimidation – while thwarting attempts to undermine the integrity of sports competitions.”</p>
<p>Providing a direct line of communication between those closest to athletic competitions and officials, US Integrity and RealResponse seek to facilitate the exchange of information and link with law enforcement, regulatory bodies, or organizations responsible for maintaining sports fair play and competition.</p>
<p>With a portfolio of partners including land-based and online casinos, sportsbook operators, sports organizers and sports governing bodies, US Integrity is continuing to expand its presence in the US by providing the highest level of protection against betting-related fraud and corruption.</p>
