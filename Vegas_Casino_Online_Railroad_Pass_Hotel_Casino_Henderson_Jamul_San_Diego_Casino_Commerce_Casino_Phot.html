<p>DrafKings’ President and Co-founder, Matt Kalish, spoke with CNBC on Tuesday this week and revealed that the company’s team is very busy in light of the recent launch of the NBA season and the return of NFL, college football, and basketball. According to Kalish, mobile sports betting will retain its popularity over time.</p>
<p>DraftKings Expects A Busy Betting Season</p>
<p>In light of the NBA season opening on Tuesday this week, DraftKings’ President and Co-founder Matt Kalish deemed this as the “most wonderful time of the year“. In an interview for CNBC, Kalish commented that the launch of the NBA season complements the return of NFL, college football, college basketball, and UFC. He added that DraftKings’ team is very busy trying to bring great sports content to its customers.</p>
<p>When Kalish was asked by the Closing Bell’s Co-Anchor Sara Eisen how popular betting is on NBA this year when compared to last year, he revealed once the “season gets rolling”, a more clear picture on sports betting will be available. Furthermore, Kalish said that complementing the opening of the NBA season, DraftKings has launched multiple promotions.</p>
<p>Kalish acknowledged that the Lakers is one of the favorite teams in pre-season, receiving some 37% of the betting action. Furthermore, the second team to receive most bets also played on Tuesday – the Brooklyn Nets.</p>
<p>Mobile Sports Betting to Retain Its Popularity</p>
<p>Another topic which Kalish discussed was whether a drop off may be anticipated once a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced and more fans return to watch the live games. Kalish revealed that more activities are taking place on mobile.</p>
<p>As an example, he pointed out the New Jersey market where an overwhelming part of the demand is coming from mobile sources rather than retails. “I think that this trend will just continue over time,” added Kalish.</p>
<p>Speaking about how games may get moved, canceled or key players may get removed from the game, Kalish said that DraftKings is a “live operation” and the team is “very accustomed to evolving with whatever is going on in sports”.</p>
<p>He added that the process may take a bit of extra energy, however, according to Kalish, DraftKings’ platform is very scalable and adaptable. In conclusion, Kalish said that DraftKings’ team is “very flexible and top-notch across the board” and doing its best to deliver the best content possible for its customers.</p>
