<p>San Jose Sharks forward Evander Kane continues to make the news and whenever his name appears, it’s always connected with some controversy. The player has been found out to have submitted a fake vaccination card which has resulted in his immediate suspension for a period of 21 games, the NHL announced on Monday.</p>
<p>The investigation into a fake COVID-19 card comes shortly after another investigation into the player betting on his own games as alleged by his estranged spouse. As a result of the latest probe and its findings, however, Kane will not be able to participate in hockey games until November 30 in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Financial Repercussion as Future Remains Unknown</p>
<p>Kane will also have to give up on $1.68 million of his $7 million salary for the season and the money will be shifted to the Players’ Emergency Assistance Fund. Kane took the news well and bore himself with dignity issuing an apology to his teammates, the Sharks, and fans by violating COVID-19 protocols which he condemned. Yet, Kane is not going anywhere and he will sit out the penalty before returning to the game:</p>
<p>“I made a mistake, one I sincerely regret and take responsibility for. During my suspension, I will continue to participate in counseling to help me make better decisions in the future. When my suspension is over, I plan to return to the ice with great effort, determination, and love for the game of hockey.” San Jose Sharks forward Evander Kane</p>
<p>The Sharks have so far not made a statement regarding Kane’s relationship with the team and they have been professional in the previous probe alleging sexual and physical abuse, arguing that they would back up the NHL in its verdict.</p>
<p>The Sharks Aren’t Happy with Kane’s Behavior</p>
<p>However, the Sharks issued a reprimand arguing that Evander’s remorse was commendable but his previous actions were not. “We will not be commenting further on Evander’s status prior to the conclusion of the NHL’s mandated suspension,” the team added.</p>
<p>While cleared of the allegations mounted by his wife, Anna Kane, the hockey player has faced many issues in his personal life. He has openly sought help for his gambling addiction but vehemently denied having ever wagered on his own games.</p>
<p>His decision to violate COVID-19 protocols comes in stark contrast with only vaccination policies in the league as 99% of the league’s roster has been vaccinated. Kane has a chance at redemption, but the question remains if the Sharks would be so disposed to give him another shot.</p>
