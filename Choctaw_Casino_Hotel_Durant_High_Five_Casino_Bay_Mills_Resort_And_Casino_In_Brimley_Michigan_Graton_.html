<p>Enter the World of Mystical Dragons</p>
<p>The fantasy/adventure-themed slot revolves around four awoken dragons roaming the skies, under the command of the almighty fire dragon. The background is loaded with dark, eye-catching, high-fantasy design elements both in the base game and during the Free Spins round, with moody sky images, massive statues, and an almost haunting choice for audio. The overall graphics and carefully chosen audio set the ground for a mystical land filled with adventures and majestic battles. With blue, green, pink, and red dragons, golden dragon eggs, and regular card symbols, the reels are packed with action and offer as many as 117,649 different ways to win.</p>
<p>Golden Dragon Egg &amp; Dragon Bonuses</p>
<p>When the Golden Dragon Egg lands on a random reel, it automatically triggers a winning spin and a variety of special game features. Each of the reels holds a random reward, ranging from cash prizes to Destruction symbols and Free Spins. The Destruction symbol is triggered every time the Dragon Egg symbol lands on a random reel. This can occur during the Free Spins round as well as during the base game.</p>
<p>Players receive a Dragon Bonus once the Golden Egg symbol lands anywhere on the grid, triggering a massive win potential. At the same time, players can also scoop up a huge cash prize up to 1,000x for just a single spin.</p>
<p>The game also features Mega Wilds on game spins or during Free Spins. When activated, the Mega Wilds turn into full reel wild symbols with ways multipliers that can reach up to x7.</p>
<p>Free Spins &amp; Buy Bonus</p>
<p>Landing a minimum of three Scatters initiates the exciting Free Spins feature. This awards ten free spins to players. Respins are also available within the round. Once a spin is completed, additional paylines get added to the grid for a higher win potential.</p>
<p>Dragons of the North Megaways also offers the Buy Bonus feature in some of Wizard Games’ jurisdictions. The feature lets players instantly step into the Free Spins round without having to rely on luck and pure chance.</p>
<p>The company’s managing director Joey Hurtado spoke about the new release, saying the studio took one of its most popular titles and gave it a “Megaways makeover”. Players familiar with the majestic northern battles against dragons in Dragons of the North launched in 2019 and Dragons of the North Deluxe released in 2020 will appreciate the new sequel’s huge win potential. At the beginning of March, Wizard Games went live with BetMGM in West Virginia. Last December, Pariplay partnered with Kaizen Gaming, integrating its Wizard Games content as well as its Fusion platform into Kaizen’s content.</p>
