<p>Beastwood review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Beastwood is themed around a haunting forest filled with monsters.</p>
<p>Players venture into a dark world ruled by fantastical beasts, some ferocious and some more adorable. With help from a wayward monster-hunting pirate, players might survive the night.</p>
<p>This slot is a good fit for players who are looking for a little magic and adventure.</p>
<p>Big win in the Beastwood slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is filled with tension-inducing drum beats and the moans of distant monsters. The delicate singing of crickets adds to the night time atmosphere.</p>
<p>As players enter the slot, they’ll see an eerie forest with slug-like monsters baring their pointy teeth. In the distance, a pirate stands in the moonlight, his musket in hand.</p>
<p>Next, players will find themselves in a cozy cabin with a roaring fire and a purple scroll of reels before them. Among the symbols they’ll find a variety of monsters in hues of green, blue, gold, and red.</p>
<p>One of the beasts is bear-like with extra long fangs, while another has one eye and sharp horns. Another of these creatures has a broken tusk and a forlorn expression. Some players might wonder if perhaps the pirate is a monster in the beasts’ world.</p>
<p>Those with sharp eyes will notice beast heads mounted on the wall and the pelt of a horned monster lying in front of the fire. This suggests that the monsters might have good reason to defend their wood.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation of Beastwood creates an engaging fantasy world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Beastwood begins as a three-reel, four-row slot. A reel is then added each time players land a winning combination, with the process continuing if the expansion generates another win.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing 3 or more matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>The maximum win is x29541 players’ total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>During the base game, a reel multiplier is associated with reel 5 as well as every third reel after that. This means a multiplier of x2 will apply to wins created on these reels.</p>
<p>If players land at least 2 matching symbols in the same reel, they will receive a win multiplier that increases with the number of matching symbols landed.</p>
<p>Reels expand after at least one winning combination</p>
<p>When players land 4 or more Bonus symbols, the Free Spins feature begins, starting with 10 free spins. Players can be awarded 3 additional free spins for each additional Bonus symbol that triggers the feature. Throughout the Free Spins, a x2 multiplier is applied to reel 4 as well as any reels to its right. During the feature, players can be awarded 1 additional free spin for each Scatter that lands.</p>
<p>Players can buy directly into the Free Spins feature by selecting the Buy Bonus option.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.09%, about our yardstick for average of roughly 96%. The freespins feature has a slightly higher RTP of 96.85%.</p>
<p>This slot pays only for 3 symbols which are then multiplied</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Beastwood is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, high volatility monster-themed slot.</p>
<p>With a respectable RTP and robust volatility, Beastwood is a solid find for mathematically-minded players.</p>
<p>The lush animation and variety of bonuses add further appeal to this fantasy slot.</p>
