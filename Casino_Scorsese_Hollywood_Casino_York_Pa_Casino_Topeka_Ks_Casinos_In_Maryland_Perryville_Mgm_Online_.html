<p>Ukrainian Gaming Week Exhibition on 24 March</p>
<p>Ukraine is about to experience its first major gambling and gaming exhibition in over 10 years – Ukrainian Gaming Week 2021 (UGW 2021). The large-scale event, which signals the revival of the country’s gambling industry, will take place on 24-25 March this year.</p>
