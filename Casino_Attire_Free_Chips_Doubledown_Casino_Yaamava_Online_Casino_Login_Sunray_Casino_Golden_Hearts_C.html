She pointed out that as a leading online betting provider in the country, LottoStar is excited to join forces with Betfred. Hadjigeorgiou revealed that the company is confident that the new collaboration will expand its offering, while at the same time delivering high-quality services for its customers. In conclusion, she revealed that the new deal with Betfred “paves the way for greater collaboration and expansion, and we are excited to grow our family.”</p>
<p>Betfred Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Betfred’s CEO, Joanne Whittaker, added that the company is delighted to join forces with LottoStar. She explained that the new deal will boost the company’s South Africa-facing operations. Whittaker pointed out that at the same time, Betfred’s European and US-facing operations would also benefit from the recent agreement. In conclusion, she said that Betfred is looking forward to the success the new deal will bring and help the company grow its presence in the South African betting market.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to partner with such a fast-growing company in South Africa, the business will not only complement our activity in South Africa but our international businesses in the US and Europe.“ Joanne Whittaker, CEO at Betfred</p>
<p>Currently, Betfred has more than 1,600 betting shops in the UK. The company is known as the largest independent bookmaker and one of the largest businesses in the North West.
