<p>The assailant pulled open the driver’s side door of the woman’s car, attacked her with the spray, and he then swiped her purse, police revealed.</p>
<p>Reno police said the suspect is Black, between 30 and 40 years old, and between five feet, eight inches and six feet tall. He was wearing a jacket with white stripes on the sleeves. He was also wearing jeans and red tennis shoes at the time of the robbery.</p>
<p>The same casino has been the site of prior crimes. On June 1, 2021, a male and female took part in an armed robbery in a hotel room at the casino. A surveillance camera took their pictures in an elevator, KOLO, a local TV station, reported.</p>
<p>Secret Witness is offering a $1,500 reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the male and female suspects, the report added.</p>
<p>Peppermill Stabbing</p>
<p>A Peppermill casino employee was expected to recover from stab wounds last October. The victim received cuts on the head.</p>
<p>They were not life-threatening. The suspect was apprehended at the crime scene. Neither he nor the victim was identified by local police at the time of the crime. The motive behind the stabbing was not known.</p>
<p>Sierra Sid’s Crimes</p>
<p>In April, in nearby Sparks, robbers held up a man at Sierra Sid’s Casino. No one appeared to have suffered injuries during the incident.</p>
<p>Initially, local police were notified that a stabbing had occurred at the Sparks gaming property. But when officers arrived, it turned out it was a holdup. Many of those involved had possessed weapons, KRNV, a local TV station, reported.</p>
<p>A victim was located inside the casino. It was unclear how much money or personal items were stolen from the man. Police said they have video of the incident from surveillance cameras, KOLO reported. The robbers and other people involved in the incident had fled before police arrived at the casino.</p>
<p>In November, a man tried to rob Sierra Sid’s Casino, KOLO reported. He walked up to the cashier’s cage and displayed a firearm.</p>
<p>He then demanded money. He was unable to get into the cashier’s cage. He eventually fled from the casino. He grabbed a purse from a woman standing by a slot machine on the casino floor on the way out.</p>
<p>Sparks is located about four miles east of Reno. The casino is located inside a truck stop.</p>
