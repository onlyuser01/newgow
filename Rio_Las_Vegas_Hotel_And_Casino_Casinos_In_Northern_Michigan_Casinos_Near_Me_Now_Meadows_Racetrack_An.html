<p>Dear witchywoman9399,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. The games in the casino are programmed to continue even when the connection between the server of the game provider and you is disconnected. If such an event happens, you can see a different result on your screen than on the casino server. If two different results exist, the correct one is the one on the casino server.</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that the winnings have not been recorded in your game history and you do not have any proof that you won these funds?</p>
<p>Additionally, please forward all the relevant communication between you and the casino to kristina.s@casino.guru. Alternatively, you can post it here.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
