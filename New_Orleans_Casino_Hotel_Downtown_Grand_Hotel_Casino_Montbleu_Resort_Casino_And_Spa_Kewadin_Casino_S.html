    <h1>New Orleans Casino Hotel Downtown Grand Hotel Casino Montbleu Resort Casino And Spa Kewadin Casino S</h1>

<p>The Japanese supplier of entertainment system has seen its Q2 results reach $337 million in the second quarter of the year</p>
<p>These numbers are attributable to the Gaming &amp; Systems segment which performed strongly in the three-month period that ended on June 30, 2023, and bolstering the company’s presence in the land-based gaming sector in North American and Australian markets.</p>
<p>Konami Gaming Hails Q2 2023 Results</p>
<p>According to the company, this vertical has “regained” its momentum from before the pandemic and was determined to carry on. In terms of actual annual growth, the Gaming &amp; Systems vertical saw a 29.9% increase to $70.2 million with business profit up $13.8 million.</p>
<p>Konami noted that it was optimistic about its global operations, as most markets in which the company had a presence in, were in the process of recovery with results improving across the board. The company further hailed the success of its Dimension 49 and Dimension 75C slot machines which have been well-received in global markets.</p>
<p>The company has also delivered strong software solutions, including brand-new games that have enjoyed acclaim from players and partner operators. Ocean Spin and Dragon’s Law have both turned into some of the most played games on the company’s cabinets. SeleXion was another prominent title to receive a warm welcome from audiences globally.</p>
<p>While this has been happening, Konami has also said that it is moving forward to strengthen its technological nous and bolster its casino management systems, allowing it to provide even more insights and value to partner operators.</p>
<p>“We aim to expand our market share by proceeding with the development of various functions that utilize cutting-edge technologies to meet the needs of our customers,” Konami said in its official report of the changes being implemented to the system.</p>
<p>More Improvements Coming Moving Forward</p>
<p>One of those is a feature that allows partners to better visualize the data collected using AI algorithms and use it to leverage better business decisions. Konami has also had many interesting developments over the past months.</p>
<p>In March, the company licensed its facial recognition technology to Independent Gaming, allowing the company to leverage the solutions in Australia.</p>
<p>Australia is currently discussing the stricter implementation of player controls designed to curb problem gambling rates and reduce risk for players, as well as combat money laundering in the Down Under. Konami is also off to a strong start in the third quarter of the year, with Pariplay, an aggregator, bringing Konami Gaming’s titles to DraftKings in New Jersey.</p>
