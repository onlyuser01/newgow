    <h1>Las Atlantis Casino Resorts Casino Atlantic City New Jersey Casino Resort Near Me Horseshoe Casino T</h1>

<p>On 06/30/23 I deposited €100 twice at Mr. Bet via giropay and made a profit of €18,000.</p>
<p>In order to pay out the amount, I should verify myself.</p>
<p>ID document, selfie and proof of residence were accepted immediately.</p>
<p>In order to verify my payment method, I should upload a PDF with the online banking statement.</p>
<p>Name, said bookings in the period from 30.06 - 03.07 with the giropay debits are clearly recognizable and assignable.</p>
<p>The PDF is original and unedited directly from my house bank.</p>
<p>I have also uploaded a bank statement directly from giropay on which you can compare the booking numbers from my bank statement. (With name, date and order, process and customer number)</p>
<p>In the meantime, the verification of the payment method has already been rejected 3 times with the unclear reason:</p>
<p>Hello! Unfortunately, your documents did not pass verification.</p>
<p>Please review your documents carefully and upload them again.</p>
<p>Thanks for the photos. Unfortunately, we cannot send your application to the finance department because your documents do not meet our security requirements. Please go to the verification page and check the requirements. Correct the documents and send them using the upload form. If you still have questions, please contact the support team.</p>
<p>I uploaded:</p>
<p>PDF bank account statement</p>
<p>PDF account statement + screenshot of account statement</p>
<p>PDF account statement + screenshot with the bookings from the giropay account</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the online chat does not give any concrete situation-related answers and says I should upload the documents again with the booking of 30.06 / 100€ that led to the win.</p>
<p>This was only debited from my account on 03.07 because it was the weekend. The date shouldn't really matter because the booking number has to match. The exact time and date are on the giropay statement.</p>
<p>I've already written a few emails with the support, so far no target-oriented results...</p>
<p>Each time it takes another 48 hours to get the Verification Failed message again, try again. It is extremely stressful and time consuming...</p>
<p>I have been registered at this casino for some time and the deposits, which have always been made via the same bank account / giropay, worked immediately and without any problems. Unfortunately, the payout has been different so far.</p>
<p>I hope you can mediate in this case and bring the matter to a good conclusion.</p>
