    <h1>Winstar Casino Restaurants Thackerville Islandview Casino Robert De Niro Casino Glasses Soboba Casin</h1>

<p>All, right! I made it to contact complaint originator on one of the Russian gabling forums. Here is the last responce from a guru's employee who managed the case:</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, I must reject your complaint. The reason for it is that Shangri La VIP casino is a different brand that functions separately from the Shangri La Live. Right now players can register in Shangri La VIP only using code provided to them by landbased casino representatives. Even the fact that they have the same owner does not allow us to demand participation in resolving the complaint from the Shangri La Live Casino. I thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Pavel K</p>

<p>Here is the obvious mistake. Both web-sites vip and live have Antillephone license validator logo - both validator links direct to exactly the same page. So shangrilavip and shangrilalive are exactly the same company InterStorm (Curacao) N.V. working exactly under the same sub-license and both sites listed under same sub-license registered web sites list. See attach:</p>
<p>So what do you mean by 'different brand'? Different brands shall have different license validator links, and different sub-license number (yet the owner can be the same). This is called MIRROR sites, not different brands. Why didn't you mark complaint as 'rejected' instead of fully delete from the site? Please clarify!</p>
