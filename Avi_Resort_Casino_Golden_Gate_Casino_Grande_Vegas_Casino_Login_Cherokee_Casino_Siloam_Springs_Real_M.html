<p>Gaming Society, a leading iGaming and sports wagering platform, has become the latest entity to throw its support behind American Gaming Association’s (AGA) Have A Game Plan, Bet Responsibly initiative. The campaign is committed to raising awareness about responsible gambling and is specifically tailored to the thriving sports betting ecosystem in the United States.</p>
<p>To mark the importance of the program, Gaming Society released a PSA that features its Co-founder, Kevin Garnett, who is the same Kevin Garnett you know from the NBA. The campaign tries to drive the message as to how important it is to approach sports betting in the United States while fully comprehending the significance of responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Gaming Society is also taking a closer look at the tools and resources it features on its own website to make sure that whenever someone needs to understand responsible gambling better, they can do so through its dedicated website. Commenting on this partnership, Garnett welcomed the opportunity to be a part of what he described as a pivotal initiative.</p>
<p>He spoke about it and said: "At Gaming Society, our mission is to make sports betting more accessible, responsible, and easier to understand." Garnett further explained that sports and betting will continue to grow and as such, a better understanding is needed about the activity. It’s more "important than ever," he added.</p>
<p>Gaming Society is already on the job with a new F2P NFL game called Bet Club which is designed to help fans understand how they can bet in a risk-free and safe environment while competing for real prizes. Gaming Society is also working on more educational content through its Betting Academy website, something that Casino Guru does as well through its own dedicated Academy.</p>
<p>Casino Guru’s Academy focuses on raising standards across the industry, equipping iGaming and betting professionals with the tools they would need to truly elevate their understanding and experience of the industry. Gaming Society is confident that it can continue to contribute to the initiative and create opportunities for consumers to be better educated and more informed about sports betting.</p>
<p>This is commendable, thinks AGA VP of Strategic Communications &amp; Responsibility CaitDeBaun. "We’re excited to welcome them as a Have A Game Plan partner and authentically spread responsible gaming messages to new and experienced players alike," DeBaut added.</p>
<p>Gaming Society makes for an important partner to AGA and its program which already features more than 30 partners, with the likes of the NFL, BetMGM, DraftKings, Entain, FanDuel, GlobalPaymnets, Delaware North, NASCAR, MLB, Greenwood Racing, the New York Rangers, the New York Jets, the PGA, and many more.</p>
