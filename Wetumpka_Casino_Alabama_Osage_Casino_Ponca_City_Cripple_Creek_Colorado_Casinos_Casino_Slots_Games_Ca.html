<p>Online casino gamblers and sports bettors will soon be able to access their funds faster through a quicker withdrawal process. As the iGaming market continues to evolve, they will soon be able to access any winnings or account funds through their nearest ATM.</p>
<p>iGaming Comes to ATMs</p>
<p>PayNearMe has announced a partnership with Pin4. The partnership will make it easier for online bettors to access their funds in early 2022. Pin4 is a company that offers business-to-business Fintech, which allows customers to have more efficient ways to collect cash.</p>
<p>PayNearMe iGaming customers should be able to access their funds quickly at over 18,000 ATMs throughout the country.</p>
<p>A player can schedule a cash payout within their PayNearMe account to initiate it. The individual will receive a message with a 4-digit code after declaring their withdrawal amount online. To instantly receive cash, the customer must enter their phone number and the amount they wish to withdraw. According to the company, in response to a question from Casino.org, the maximum daily withdrawal amount will be $500.</p>
<p>PayNearMe announced its partnership with Pin4 at this week’s SBC Summit North America in Secaucus, NJ.</p>
<p>PayNearMe Enjoying Rapid Growth</p>
<p>PayNearMe operates in 17 states where online gambling is legal. Nine of the top ten internet casino and sportsbook sites, including BetMGM and FanDuel have signed contracts with PayNearMe.</p>
<p>One of the biggest frustrations for iGaming players is not receiving their funds when they request a withdrawal. PayNearMe claims its Pin4 partnership will address these grievances.</p>
<p>Withdrawing funds has always been a significant pain point for players,” stated Michael Kaplan, PayNearMe’s chief revenue officer. He added, “We’re helping operators solve that with this partnership. We provide the most — and the industry’s best — deposit and withdrawal options on a single platform, and will continue to identify ways to expand these options for operators and their players.”</p>
<p>PayNearMe has announced that its Pin4 ATM option is being integrated into the company’s Moneyline iGaming platform and mobile sports betting money transfer platform. PayNearMe’s ATMs will allow players to use their funds at over 31,000 locations in the US.</p>
<p>ATM Withdrawals Made Simple</p>
<p>Many people, as they get used to the new system, might initially find it difficult to withdraw funds from their PayNearMe accounts at ATM machines. Pin4 claims that the process is simple.</p>
<p>At a Pin4 ATM, customers will choose a cardless transaction to begin. The next step is to select “Mastercard Cash Pickup” and then follow the prompts on the screen. These prompts will ask for a telephone number, withdrawal amount and the four-digit pin that PayNearMe sent earlier via SMS.</p>
<p>PayNearMe stated that its partnership with Pin4 was due to the large number of online gamblers who prefer cash to fund their gambling activities. According to the company, cash withdrawals from its retail locations are still popular and will continue to be so.</p>
