    <h1>Casino In Battle Creek Michigan Pearl River Resort Casino Silver Sevens Casino Ovation Hall At Ocean</h1>

<p>The market-leading performance marketing company XLMedia has added a new talented individual to its team. The one joining the company at this time is Caroline Ackroyd who will be taking the role of its new chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Ackroyd Brings 15 Years of Experience to the Company</p>
<p>The acquisition was announced back in November 2021 and was scheduled to come into power in March 2022. Ackroyd is officially stepping into the office and will be assuming responsibility for XLMedia’s finance. She has also been admitted into the company’s board of directors and will help to make important decisions concerning the brand’s future.</p>
<p>Ackroyd is a decorated veteran in the world of finance, having previously served in various similar positions at other companies. Starting October 2006, Ackroyd worked as Sky Betting &amp; Gaming’s deputy finance director for almost five years.</p>
<p>In 2011, she joined Coral as a finance director but returned to Sky Betting &amp; Gaming after two years, opting to become the former company’s financial consultant and later its director of commercial finance. In 2018, Ackroyd began work as a chief financial officer at Push Doctor and in 2020 moved to the same position at Jaywing.</p>
<p>Prior to Ackroyd’s official stepping as a chief financial officer of XLMedia, Rowan Ellis filled the vacant role as an interim CFO. Ellis will now assist with a seamless transfer of power and will return to his previous occupation as a financial consultant.</p>
<p>Ackroyd’s Financial Savvy Will Open a New Chapter for XLMedia</p>
<p>Ackroyd shared her thoughts on joining XLMedia back in November. She revealed that she is delighted to join the company and cannot wait to work with its skilled team. Ackroyd said that she looks forward to collaborating with the experienced workers and ushering in a new age for XLMedia.</p>
<p>Stuart Simms, XLMedia’s chief executive officer, had spoken about the acquisition. He welcomed the new appointee to the company and lauded her skill as a financial worker. According to Simms, Ackroyd will be a great addition to XLMedia’s leadership team and board of directors.</p>
<p>“Her deep understanding and intimate knowledge of our sector offer tangible value and insights, especially in light of the dramatic progress we are delivering in US sports,” Simms had said.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Ackroyd as a CFO is not the only leadership reshuffling XLMedia has gone through in recent times. In January this year, Christopher Bell resigned as a non-executive chairman, opting to join Nueva Codere instead. A month later, Julie Markey was appointed as an interim non-exec chairman.</p>
