<p>WynnBET Enters Arizona Market via Strategic Agreement</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts, the global luxury hospitality leader, announced on Friday last week that its WynnBET sports betting app secured online sports betting license in Arizona. The market entry was completed in collaboration with the San Carlos Apache Tribal Gaming Enterprise.</p>
<p>The company revealed that it will grant Arizona customers access to its Wynn Rewards program as soon as the state launches sports wagering, which is planned for September 9 this year. Additionally, Wynn unveiled that there will be three-member tiers: Red, Platinum, and Black.</p>
<p>Coinciding with Wynn’s announcement, the Arizona Department of Gaming (ADG) announced the list of tribal and professional sports organizations that have been granted event wagering licenses. Under current Arizona regulations, the ADG can allocate 20 licenses in total, 10 to professional sports teams/organizations and 10 to tribal operators.</p>
<p>ADG Allocates 18 Event Wagering Licenses</p>
<p>On Friday, the regulator said that it had allocated a total of 18 licenses. In other words, two applicants did not receive a license from the ADG. The regulator said that licensed event wagering operators can start their marketing and sign-up campaigns online and via mobile applications as of Saturday, August 28. However, the ADG stressed that event wagering will not go live before September 9 this year.</p>

Those are FanDuel, DraftKings, and FFPC. Yahoo, Fantasy Sports Shark as well as Underdog Sports have also received fantasy sports contest licenses from the ADG.</p>
<p>“I am proud of the hard work by all to accomplish this feat and excited to see Arizonans responsibly enjoy legal fantasy sports starting tomorrow, 8/28, as well as event wagering on 9/9!” Ted Vogt, director, ADG</p>
<p>Ted Vogt, director at the ADG, thanked stakeholders and the public for their feedback regarding event wagering and fantasy sports implementation processes. The hard work and dedication of everyone involved “allowed Arizona to be one of the fastest states to operationally start these new games since the passing of the enabling legislation,” explained Vogt.</p>
