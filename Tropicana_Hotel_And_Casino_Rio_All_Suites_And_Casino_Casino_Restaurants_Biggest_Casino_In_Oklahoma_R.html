    <h1>Tropicana Hotel And Casino Rio All Suites And Casino Casino Restaurants Biggest Casino In Oklahoma R</h1>

<p>dear disputes. My name is Darren and I am declaired unfit to work. I like to play slot machine games @ 10p a go from time to time. So joined magic wins casino. Deposited £15 then realised at the time of my deposit ,you couldn’t withdraw any amount under £50 I think ?? So I contacted them and asked to self exclude my self and asked for my refund without playing any of these conn people’s games. Then I asked for notification’s to stop but as a tease they kept sending me text- emails for around 60 days. I must of contacted them to ask for my £15 and to stop any notifications around 29 times. And the type of message I received was. My account has closed and please be patient ??? That’s after 30 days then 60 days. I told them I was unwell and lost all of my family and partner recently and they actually sent me a personal email saying ……Darren deposit now because you can now withdraw less than £50 because we have changed the withdrawals rules ?? These people are so so DISCUSTING and horrid. It’s made me unwell and needing my monies. Aw I’m off work and have previously worked all</p>
<p>of my life. I have time to report these people and try and get them closed. So please could somebody help me with who to inform and how to go about procedures please. It’s gave me the feeling of evil tbh. And very hard to believe they can do this ??? And take good honest loyal peoples money. I’m just glad I realised at the start from THEYRE withdrawing rules. As it’s only £15 but that’s 1 weeks worth of food for my later partners cats which I’ve swore to take care of. Who I adore and cherish</p>
<p>my contact details are t<strong><em>*37@live.com. I hope to hear from a good person soon. Merry Christmas to this team and my kind regards Dsrren T</em></strong>*</p>
