    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Mississippi Resort World Casino Las Vegas Casinos In Gulfport Map Of Casinos</h1>

<p>There are only two races on the Formula 1 calendar that Max Verstappen hasn’t won (yet). One of those is on the program on Sunday, July 9 – the 2023 British Grand Prix</p>
<p>The winner of the previous two Formula 1 Championships, Max Verstappen, is very likely to win the 2023 season as well. He’s won seven of the nine races so far this year and is favored to triumph in the UK as well. Winning the British Grand Prix comes with a special incentive for him as this is one of only two races that he still hasn’t won. Can he do it on July 9? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Max Verstappen Looking Invincible Right Now</p>
<p>The Dutchman keeps getting better and better in 2023. He’s sitting at the top of the F1 Drivers’ Championship with 81 points more than the second-placed Sergio Perez who’s his teammate from the Red Bull Racing team.</p>
<p>Verstappen has won seven of the nine races run so far in the Formula 1 2023 season. In the two races that he didn’t win, we saw him finish second each time. He’s been impressive since the start of the season, but last weekend’s race was arguably his best thus far. He won the Austrian GP, while we also saw him win the pole position, as well as record the fastest lap.</p>
<p>Verstappen broke a Formula 1 record last Sunday, becoming the driver with the most triumphs in the Austrian race. This weekend, he stands a chance to set another milestone – he can win the British GP for the first time in his career. If he pulls it off, he’ll only have one more race left on that calendar that he’s yet to win (Sao Paulo GP).</p>
<p>“Checo” Coming Off a Pretty Decent Performance</p>
<p>Sergio “Checo” Perez really lifted his performance last weekend. He was aggressive, showing his desire to do much better than in the previous couple of races. As a reminder, before finishing on the podium in Austria, he had three disappointing races, finishing in 16th, 4th, and 6th place.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, he finished 3rd after losing the battle for the second spot to Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc. On the plus side for “Checo,” he was way better than his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. with whom he had a real war on the track throughout the race.</p>
<p>The competition between the two Ferrari drivers made the race way more fun, not to mention that it (probably) gave the two of them an incredible morale boost for the remainder of the season. We expect to see both of them show up on July 9, with Perez probably doing better once again.</p>
<p>2023 British GP Prediction</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is the absolute ruler of the F1 universe in 2023, so it would be crazy not to back him to win another race. We think he’s gonna win the British Grand Prix without any major problems. It’s the battle for the No. 2 and No. 3 place that’s going to be way more exciting.</p>
<p>We think it’s very likely one of the two Ferrari drivers will get on the podium, with Leclerc looking slightly more likely to be the one.</p>
<p>Picks: Max Verstappen to win; Charles Leclerc to finish in the top 3.</p>
