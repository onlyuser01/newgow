<p>By joining the Portuguese Online Betting and Gambling Association, PokerStars will help with the promotion of responsible gambling and the establishment of a sustainable industry in the country</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment, the global sports betting, entertainment and gaming provider, confirmed Monday that PokerStars officially joined the Portuguese Online Betting and Gambling Association (APAJO). Becoming a part of APAJO, the network was designated as its newest affiliate member.</p>
<p>The membership marks a milestone moment for the brand as it was one of the first to launch its services within the regulated market in Portugal. In addition to joining forces with the Association, the brand may collaborate with other companies operating within the region that include Casino Portugal, Bwin, Betano and Betclic, among others.</p>
<p>João Saraiva, PokerStars’ planning and strategy manager for Portugal, shared his excitement about the freshly minted collaboration with APAJO. He noted that PokerStars is delighted to collaborate with licensed companies in the region and contribute toward the establishment of a responsible gambling environment with the Association. Finally, Saraiva said: “We have high ambitions for this market, and we can’t wait to start working together with APAJO.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to join APAJO and look forward to sharing our expertise from other licensed jurisdictions to support APAJO in promoting a responsible and safe play environment.“ João Saraiva, planning and strategy manager for Portugal at PokerStars</p>
<p>The Association Continues to Expand Its List of Members</p>
<p>Ricardo Domingues, APAJO’s president of the Board, was similarly delighted to see PokerStars join the Association. He acknowledged that the brand was a part of the market since 2016 and it is globally recognized. Additionally, Domingues said that the Association is looking forward to the benefits the collaboration with PokerStars will bring.</p>
<p>Finally, the president of the Board said: “APAJO has ambitious plans for 2023 and PokerStars will play an important role in driving these forwards. We also would like to use this opportunity to renew our invitation to the other licensed operators to join.”</p>
<p>“APAJO is pleased to welcome into its group one of the leading international brands and an operator which has been in the market since 2016.“ Ricardo Domingues, president of the Board of APAJO</p>
<p>The Association was created back in 2018. Since then, it has grown exponentially and by now it presents locally licensed members in governmental, regulatory and other discussions.</p>
<p>Moreover, APAJO helped develop a comprehensive Responsible Gambling Manual that its members need to adhere to in addition to the existing responsible gambling regulations. The Association has also played a key role in the development of a sustainable market in Portugal.</p>
