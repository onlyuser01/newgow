    <h1>Choctaw Casino Resort Durant Caesars Casino Bonus Code Lotus Asia Casino Hard Rock Casino App Hoosie</h1>

<p>One of the leading geolocation and compliance specialists has brought on a new chief executive officer who stepped in the role on May 1</p>
<p>Manu Gambhir is now the new CEO of Xpoint and he will help with the firm’s growth and broadening its list of partners in the real money online gaming market. Xpoint’s co-founder, Marvin Sanderson, will now refocus his efforts on Xpoint’s business development instead.</p>
<p>Xpoint Taps New Company Chief Executive</p>
<p>The appointment of Gambhir to lead the company is not a chance thing either. Xpoint has carefully looked into the executive and has been assured of his industry leadership qualities. Gambhir comes from the industry with more than 20 years of experience, working within the gaming market in the United States in particular.</p>
<p>He also helped with Games 24×7, a real money gaming company in India, and was the chief executive at Thrive Gaming, which was in charge of Wynn Resorts’ initial online gambling launch in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Gambhir also helped found two digital gaming platforms, Ryzing and Kismet Studios, both of which became successes and were eventually acquired by bigger companies. Commenting on his appointment, Xpoint Director David VanEgmond hailed Gambhir’s addition to the team, and argued that he would contribute to the firm’s next chapter growth:</p>
<p>His deep understanding, experience and relationships across the real-money gaming market will accelerate the rapid growth and traction Xpoint has experienced in the past year. Xpoint Director David VanEgmond</p>
<p>Gambhir was similarly optimistic about his role with the company and said that Xpoint is a leading geolocation provider and that the technology the company develops will continue to be of paramount importance to operators in the sector.</p>
<p>Confidence in the Future Success</p>
<p>“I look forward to working with Marvin and the entire Xpoint team to bring an innovative and extremely reliable solution to real-money gaming operators,” Gambhir said, adding that there is tremendous potential to tap into new technologies, such as AI-driven insights which are becoming increasingly relevant.</p>
<p>The now former chief executive, Sanderson, played a crucial role in the establishment of Xpoint as a trusted and reliable geolocation software service in the United States. Xpoint currently operates a technical lab at the New Jersey Department of Gaming Enforcement. The company is further authorized to offer its services in ten states. Xpoint also settled a brief legal flare-up with one of its main rivals in the country, GeoComply, earlier this year.</p>
