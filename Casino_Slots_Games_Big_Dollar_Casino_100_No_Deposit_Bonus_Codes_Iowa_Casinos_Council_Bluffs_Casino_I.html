<p>SpinAway has entered into a partnership agreement with Gaming Innovations Group (GiG) to officially launch its offering in the Canadian province of Ontario. The online casino has gone live and will operate through GiG’s platform. The local players will have access to SpinAway’s variety of online casino games.</p>
<p>GiG Awarded a License for Ontario in July</p>
<p>In July 2022, GiG received regulatory approval and obtained a supplier license for Ontario from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). It is authorized to operate its B2B sportsbook and player account management (PAM) platform in the said Canadian province.</p>
<p>In addition, previously, GiG announced it had been awarded “interim authorization” to operate in Pennsylvania and intended to move to Keystone State.</p>
<p>Representatives of SpinAway stated that GiG’s technology was specifically designed to support SpinAway’splansfor market expansion in North American regulated markets and around the world.</p>
<p>A spokesperson of SpinAway commented that they were “delighted” for having been able to accomplish their plans for expansion in Ontario by entering into a partnership with GiG. The online casino operator was confident that the brand would be successful in the province.</p>
<p>We have been vocal about our commitment to growth in regulated markets and making sure our technology is suited to the demands of helping both new and existing partners expand their operations. Nicola Fitton, chief operations officer, GiG</p>
<p>Fitton also added that GiG was very excited about supporting SpinAway to launch its offering in Ontario and was very proud of the partnership agreement and the future cooperation between the two companies, promising GiG to facilitate its technology and excellent reputation.</p>
<p>GiG Cooperated with L7 Entertainment</p>
<p>Before SpinAway’s launch, last week, GiG helped L7 Entertainment enter Ontario through its LuckyDays brand. The said brand is currently active with its online casino offering on the GiG platform in Ontario.</p>
<p>This was the second market launch for L7 Entertainment and GiG after an earlier launch in Sweden.</p>
<p>Ontario’s Market Performance Results</p>
<p>Last month, the market performance results for Ontario for the second quarter, released by iGaming Ontario, provided an almost CA$2 billion increase compared to the first-quarter results.</p>
<p>The total bets amounted to CA$6.04 billion for the period until September 30 without promotional wagers being factored in, which is a significant growth given that the first quarter results were CA$4.07 billion.</p>
