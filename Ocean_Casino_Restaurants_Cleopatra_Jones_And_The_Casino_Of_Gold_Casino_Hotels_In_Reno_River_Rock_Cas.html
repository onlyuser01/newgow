<p>Legendary NBA coach George Karl has joined BetRivers as an official sponsor and brand ambassador.</p>
<p>George Karl to Be Face of RSI’s BetRivers</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive betting and gaming brand BetRivers has entered in an exclusive content deal with former NBA coach George Karl, one of the nine coaches in the history of the association to win over 1,000 games in his career, and not least known for his performance with the Denver Nuggets.</p>
<p>Karl will support RSI’s efforts with BetRivers’ “Bet with a Winner” campaign, seeking to create tailored content and lead to stronger engagement with fans.</p>
<p>Coach Karl will step in as a brand ambassador and spokesperson, and will be part of the company’s marketing efforts on social media and beyond.</p>
<p>He will also bring much needed insight into the NBA and allow BetRivers customers to see the game through the eyes of one of its most decorated coaches.</p>
<p>Discussing the opportunity, RSI president Richard Schwartz said that the company was thrilled to be teaming up with one of the greatest people in the history of the NBA. “George Karl was successful at every level of the sport, and we’re excited for him to bring his enthusiasm and knowledge to the sports betting arena here at BetRivers.com,” Karl noted.</p>
<p>Building Meaningful and Genuine Relationships</p>
<p>In his 30 years as a coach, Karl has done a lot. He has mentored numerous MVPs, including Allen Iverson, Shawn Kemp, Ray Allen, Chauncey Billups, and others to greatness. Under his guidance, teams have completely upended their fortunes, consolidating their leadership positions for generations.</p>
<p>“My philosophy,” said Karl commenting on the partnership “has always been about being truthful, honest and real.” Karl has added the sixth-most wins during regular NBA seasons, and he has pounced at the opportunity to be part of the BetRivers brand and family.</p>
<p>RSI and BetRivers seem to have developed real and meaningful relationships with consumers, Karl noted, adding that he would be looking to strengthen that. Karl’s career has taken him through many of the top NBA franchises, including the Nuggets, Seattle Supersonics, Milwaukee Bucks, Golden State Warrior, and Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
<p>BetRivers’ pull in Illinois and Pennsylvania is significant.</p>
