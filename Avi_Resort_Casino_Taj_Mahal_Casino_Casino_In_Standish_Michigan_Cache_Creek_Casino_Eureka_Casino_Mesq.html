    <h1>Avi Resort Casino Taj Mahal Casino Casino In Standish Michigan Cache Creek Casino Eureka Casino Mesq</h1>

<p>10 Ten Gaming LLC, an up-and-coming developer that specializes in social and real money gambling solutions, has reached out to an established tech partner to scale its offer</p>
<p>Moving forward, 10 Ten Gaming will have access to Comtrade Gaming’s gCore technology (RGS) which is a cloud-hosted managed solution that will make the deployment and development of the supplier’s games quick and easy.</p>
<p>10 Ten Gaming Taps into Comtrade’s RGS Solution</p>
<p>The new partnership will allow 10 Ten Gaming to focus on expanding its reach in the gambling space, with the company operating out of California as a recently established startup in the vertical. Commenting on this partnership, Comtrade Gaming’s CCO Steven Valentine said that the company was excited to be providing 10 Ten Gaming with the means to create exceptional games.</p>
<p>The RGS solution that is powered by Comtrade Gaming enables both large and small game vendors to achieve independence in their product development and have a powerful technology they can use to move forward with. Essentially, the RGS solution allows studios to distribute their games across various platforms, including online and mobile, as well as server-based platforms.</p>
<p>Comtrade Gaming’s product is licensed in some of the biggest iGaming jurisdictions as well, including Malta, the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, and since recently in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, allowing partners to also expand their reach and continue growing their operational scale.</p>
<p>10 Ten Gaming CEO Kyaw Zaw was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that he was very happy to see Comtrade Gaming offer its RGS technology to enable the company to build a new library of titles that can be delivered quickly and independently to operators and their audiences.</p>
<p>Comtrade Gaming has been expanding its list of partners by offering promising studios the same service. Recently, the company revealed a similar partnership with another innovative casino supplier, Arcadem.</p>
