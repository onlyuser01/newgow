<p>Direct human messaging platform 2mee, which helps online gambling companies establish a better rapport with their audiences and players, is teaming up with RacingTV, to seek further opportunities with operators. Moving forward, sportsbook brands working with RacingTV will be able to benefit from 2mee’s unique hologram messaging technology that the company has developed to create more memorable experiences.</p>
<p>Direct Human Messaging to Help RacingTV Partners</p>
<p>Sports bettors will communicate with holograms which are designed to elevate the experience for returning and new consumers. RacingTV currently partners with BetVictor and SkyBet which have been able to trial the technology for the past several weeks, and both have reported very good results. Engagement and conversions have increased.</p>
<p>To help build up momentum for the brands and compel consumers into registering, 2mee worked with BetVictor brand ambassador Harry Redknapp who advertised a new player bonus which resulted in 38% engagement through the hologram messaging, a very good result. 2mee prides itself on having developed a messaging program that makes it easy to rivet audiences’ attention and achieve better conversation across the board.</p>
<p>2mee is committed to ensuring that it can continue to deliver strong results for its partners. Such partners include big-name brands such as Betfred and Sportsbet.io, both of which have been benefiting from 2mee’s solutions. 2mee CEO James Riley welcomed this opportunity and said:</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be working with the innovative team at RacingTV and for its operator partners to be able to use our technology to send direct human messages to bettors. This really does allow them to stand out from the crowd and take engagement and conversion to the next level. 2mee CEO James Riley</p>
<p>Emotional marketing is definitely the most effective way to deliver any form of message and the company is happy to use this unique face-to-face messaging which helps elevate its own reputation but also drives strong results for partner companies.</p>
<p>Unmatched Conversion and Retention Rates</p>
<p>RacingTV Clive Cottrell was similarly thrilled with the partnership opportunity. He admitted that the company has not seen engagement and conversation rates that can quite match 2mee. “As an affiliate, this not only allows us to acquire increased volumes of new customers to our operator partners, but we too benefit from enhanced engagement, conversion rates, and affiliate revenue streams,” Cottrell concluded.</p>
