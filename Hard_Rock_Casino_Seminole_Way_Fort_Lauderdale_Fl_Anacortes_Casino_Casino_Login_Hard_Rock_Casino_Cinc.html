<p>The leading sports betting operator has chosen Amazon as its strategic cloud partner, enhancing user experiences and supporting its growing customer base</p>
<p>FanDuel has taken a significant step forward in its mission to provide top-tier services to users across North America. Partnering with a high-profile supplier like AWS represents the operator’s enduring commitment to delivering an exceptional customer experience and should help foster sustained growth in the region. Such innovative technology should allow FanDuel to stay at the forefront of technological developments and maintain its leadership position.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Service Offers Significant Advantages</p>
<p>AWS’ impressive capabilities should turbocharge FanDuel’s expansion efforts across the United States and Canada. Amazon’s Local Zones and AWS Outposts services will be crucial to minimizing latency, ensuring the operator’s products deliver fast and seamless experiences to users. The broad selection of useful tools and solutions will support FanDuel’s diverse workloads and enhance overall operations.</p>
<p>In the world of sports betting, where millions of users can simultaneously place bets, stream content, and access various features, having a robust and scalable infrastructure is paramount. VP of Amazon EC2 edge Jan Hofmeyr noted that AWS represented the perfect solution for a high-profile operator, offering stellar performance security and scalability.</p>

<p>At the heart of this partnership lies a commitment to enhancing user experiences. By leveraging AWS’s cloud capabilities, FanDuel aims to create an environment where users can seamlessly engage with its services. The operator also represents one of AWS’s most prominent users, elevating the platform to new heights and demonstrating its substantial benefits to the gaming industry.</p>
<p>FanDuel Remains Dedicated to Providing a World-Leading Experience</p>
<p>This groundbreaking partnership represents a substantial milestone in FanDuel’s North American expansion efforts. The operator consistently reports rising revenues powered by excellent customer acquisition and retention strategies. According to FanDuel SVP of Technology Shane Sweeney, collaborating with AWS would future-proof the operator’s services and deliver lasting value.</p>

<p>The collaboration will ensure that FanDuel retains the flexibility to adapt to new technologies and emerging trends. The company recently concluded another high-profile partnership with YouTube, bolstering fan engagement with unprecedented access to out-of-market Sunday afternoon NFL games. This fusion of media and sports betting forms the foundation of FanDuel’s business model, which has proven wildly successful.</p>
<p>With AWS’ support, FanDuel sets the stage for future industry innovations as more services migrate to the cloud. The partnership marks a significant milestone in the company’s journey to provide top-notch sports betting experiences in North America, handle the complexities of a rapidly growing user base, and ensure smooth expansion into new jurisdictions.</p>
