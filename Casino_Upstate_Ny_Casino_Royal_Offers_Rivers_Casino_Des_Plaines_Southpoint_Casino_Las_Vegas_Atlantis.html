    <h1>Casino Upstate Ny Casino Royal Offers Rivers Casino Des Plaines Southpoint Casino Las Vegas Atlantis</h1>

<p>The move will cement GiG’s position in the key North American market, the company said</p>
<p>Leading iGaming tech company Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) has announced the completion of its acquisition of KaFe Rocks, a major online casino affiliate. The announcement was first announced in November and saw the tech giant acquire the affiliate in a EUR 35 million deal.</p>
<p>According to GiG, the new acquisition will position its proprietary media division, GiG Media, as the leading iGaming affiliation brand. The move will also cement GiG’s position in the key North American market, the company added.</p>
<p>As previously announced GiG will pay a total of EUR 35 million (roughly $38.5 million current rates) for the acquisition. This includes an upfront cash payment of EUR 15 million (16.5 million), followed by semi-annual payments totaling EUR 20 million ($22 million). GiG may also issue EUR 2.5 million ($2.75 million) in own shares to the sellers in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>KaFe Rocks’ assets are consolidated as of December 21, 2023.</p>
<p>The Deal Is in Line with the Company’s Overall Strategy</p>
<p>The acquisition of Kafe Rocks follows GiG’s takeover of AskGamblers, previously owned by Catena Media.</p>
<p>The growing affiliate strength of GiG Media positions it to drive KaFe Rocks’ growth, allowing it to expand substantially. GiG also believes that the natural synergies with KaFe Rocks will allow the latter brand to secure revenue of $25 million, as well as an EBITDA margin of over 45%.</p>
<p>The acquisition of KaFe Rocks is also in line with GiG Media’s business diversification efforts. Diversification remains an important strategic goal for the company, which seeks to solidify its business by having a wide customer base, multiple websites and businesses in many key jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Jonas Warner, Gaming Innovation Group’s group chief executive officer, commented on the completed deal, expressing his satisfaction with the new acquisition. He said that the transaction is in line with the company’s goal to maintain its leadership position in the world of casino affiliation and expand GiG’s presence across the lucrative North American market.</p>
<p>The inclusion of KaFe Rocks aligns perfectly with these objectives. We’ve identified a thriving business led by an exceptionally skilled team. We eagerly anticipate integrating KaFe Rocks into the GiG family, unlocking additional business value to benefit our partners and investors. Jonas Warner, group CEO, GiG</p>
<p>In other news, GiG just completed the issuing of an $81 million senior secured bond issue. Shortly after, the company announced the appointment of Matthew Saxon as its new chief technology officer.</p>
