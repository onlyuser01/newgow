    <h1>Mill Bay Casino Las Vegas Strip Casinos Philadelphia Mississippi Casinos Mgm Springfield Casino Casi</h1>

<p>Well the issue goes like this</p>
<p>this was a promotional bonus that was awarded to me I believe it was 100 spins on a certain game if I made a deposit it was a recruitment bonus that had been offered to me over and over and I had not accepted it many times however, this one evening I decided to accept their continued pestering me with offers and agree to try out this new site that is a division of the play Ojo conglomerate….</p>
<p>So I took the plunge and made my first deposit I made a deposit then was awarded the bonus and after completion of the 100spins I had winnings of $13.74 that is a very important number to remember $13.74 was won from this bonus I proceeded to take the money to a different slot— book of magic and was very happy pleased and lucky to turn that into approximately $600</p>
<p>after giving back a little bit and after thinking that I should "book a win" I decided to withdraw $400 and leave My self 50 or $60 to try to replicate the win… when I clicked to withdraw it said that I cannot do it…. J cannot make this withdraw because I have an active bonus …. in order to make this withdrawal you must cancel your bonus and to follow these instructions. so I did just as the instructions stated for me to do in order to withdraw I must cancel the active bonus that is what was said to me —-so I followed the instructions on what I needed to do to withdraw my funds….</p>
<p>so I was directed to the active bonus page and Please understand that I was already very clear in my mind to be hesitant and read the fine print carefully because I am not new to online gaming I know that if I cancel a bonus it could implicate a significant amount of my winnings (never would think all of it ha ha ha ) also as a sidenote I gave the site plenty of play and when the offer to cancel the bonus popped up I believed I had completed my Playthrough requirements as there was no pop up screen that showed I had to continue with a certain amount in order to fulfil the requirement NO it just said cancel it and hence I paid very close attention to the page that I was asked to accept I cancelled and it gave me a pop-up stating that I will be cancelling the bonus this change cannot be undone and that I was about to give up the 13.74 I thought I was paying very close attention to how much I was cancelling and I thought hey losing $13.74 from $400 I think is a fair deal when I clicked yes and I accept I must stress I was only accepting to cancel with the bonus of $13.74 at no time did it say I would be giving up my entire bank room as again common sense must to can and say who in their right mind would be willing to give up the entire bankroll that doesn’t make sense and there should be a fail safe or a redundancy factor or a panic switch or a third or of how about this it should be impossible for a player to accept that result as it is just stupid it is not normal it is not something that would be done in the real world who would cancel the entire banquet who do that and I believe that the casino should not allow that result to be selected by the player especially by the player who is uninformed by the player who is given less than forthcoming information add a minimum the information that was provided was not clear for me to make an informed and Property decision and I revert back to the fact that that decision should not be an option that the player can make to cancel the bonus so that they can have a zero balance I smile as I write this it’s just silly so we come to this is the issue</p>
<p>I went refresh the page and my balance was 0.00 $ now again common sense must be brought to the forefront here and stated who in their right mind would be willing to cancel their bonus if it nullified the entire bankroll this is the premise of this whole complaint and the whole issue I am having in turn I repeat—— I try to issue a withdrawal in order to move forward with this withdrawal I was told that I must cancel the active bonus I believe I read the information very correctly and it stated that is $13.74 hence I was under the very strong understanding that I would be removing $13.74 from my balance I was prepared to accept that and I feel that is fair as well then all of a sudden l my bankroll is zero I have contacted the casino a number of occasions first to the email address that is provided in their help section is not active and kept on spitting me back the email I had sent upon finally getting a hold and starting a dialogue The casino has reiterated the fact of their bonus terms and conditions citing sections of their fine print and I can understand and respect that what I cannot understand and</p>
<p>TO BE CONTINUED</p>
