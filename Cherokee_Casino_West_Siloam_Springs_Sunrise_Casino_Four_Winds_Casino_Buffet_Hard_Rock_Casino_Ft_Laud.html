<p>GAMSTOP attributed the high number of young registrants to the active promotion of its services</p>
<p>GAMSTOP, a free self-exclusion scheme that helps gamblers get their online gaming habits under control, announced that it has recorded a record-breaking number of registrations in 2023. According to the organization, over 433,357 have signed up for the program so far.</p>
<p>In 2023, GAMSTOP recorded 92,086 new registrations, which is the highest number it has seen in a single year. This figure is also 9.5% higher than the one recorded in 2022. May stood as a record-breaking month as the service welcomed 8,591 new users.</p>
<p>Following a high number of registrations in H1, the second half of the year also saw a 31% year-on-year growth in the number of registrations from people aged 16-24. This suggested an increased awareness in younger players, according to GAMSTOP. In total, 21% of all customers who registered in the second half of the year were within this age group.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP attributed the high number of young registrants to the active promotion of its services. In 2023, GAMSTOP representatives toured university campuses across the United Kingdom, raising awareness of the dangers of excessive gambling and the merits of self-exclusion.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP also pointed out that over half of all GAMSTOP registrants (55%) have picked a five-year exclusion, which is the longest period currently offered by the service.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP Is a Lifeline for Many People</p>
<p>Now five years old, GAMSTOP continues to provide services to people across the UK. GAMSTOP’s chief executive officer, Fiona Palmer, commented on the recent figures, saying that the year-on-year increase in the number of registrants is a good thing. She argued that it means that more people are aware of and willing to use GAMSTOP’s services.</p>
<p>We want to continue raising awareness of GAMSTOP to anyone who might benefit from self-exclusion and to the friends and families of anyone affected by gambling. Fiona Palmer, CEO, GAMSTOP</p>
<p>Harj Gahley, 38, is a former problem gambler who used to suffer from gambling addiction for a decade. As someone who started when he was at the age of 23, Gahley highlighted the importance of providing people with self-exclusion services.</p>
<p>Now a non-executive director at the gambling charity Red Card, Harj lauded GAMSTOP as a “necessary lifeline for thousands of vulnerable people.”</p>
<p>For me, GAMSTOP has been a crucial part of my recovery knowing that I’m safely blocked from being able to gamble online. Harj Gahley, NED, Red Card</p>
<p>Gahley recommended the service to anyone who might have problems with their gambling or know a problem player.</p>
