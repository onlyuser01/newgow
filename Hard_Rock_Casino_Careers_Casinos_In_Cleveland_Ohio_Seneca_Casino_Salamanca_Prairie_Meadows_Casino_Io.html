    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Careers Casinos In Cleveland Ohio Seneca Casino Salamanca Prairie Meadows Casino Io</h1>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I played at Slots Empire and won 180 Euro from Bonus. After that I deposited 20 Euro via Bitcoin as per their terms to withdraw winnings. Then they called me to confirm my account details. And I attended the call then it was confirmed. After that they asked me for my documents. As per their instruction I sent all documents 6 days ago. As per their terms they need 3 days to validate the documents but they didn't reply me. Then today I go to live chat to asking about my account validation.</p>
<p>But they reply me that:</p>
<p>Chat on tawk.to</p>

<p>[10:06] Jason: Hi Sayma !</p>
<p>[10:06] Jason: I have checked your account and it appeared that your membership has been terminated due to violation of Terms of the company.</p>
<p>[10:07] Sayma5566: When it appeared?</p>
<p>[10:07] Sayma5566: I didn't violate any terms</p>
<p>[10:07] Jason: Thanks for stopping by, we hope to hear from you again soon!</p>
<p>[10:07] Jason has left the conversation</p>
<p>[10:08] Sayma5566: Excuse me, Can you please explain me the reason?</p>
<p>[10:08] Wayne has joined the conversation</p>
<p>[10:08] Wayne: Great to see you online with Slots Empire! May I ask for your username so that I can assist you?</p>
<p>[10:08] Sayma5566: Sayma5566</p>
<p>[10:09] Wayne: Hello Sayma</p>
<p>[10:09] Wayne: The Casino does not accept real money wagers from the residents of Bangladesh. Please note that wagers, login sessions, bets or any other activities are forbidden from the mentioned locations.</p>
<p>[10:09] Sayma5566: Why my membership terminated?</p>
<p>[10:09] Sayma5566: From when?</p>
<p>[10:10] Sayma5566: But I have winnings in my account</p>
<p>[10:11] Sayma5566: I made first deposit with Bitcoin and sent my documents for verification 5 days ago. As per instructed to me.</p>
<p>[10:12] Sayma5566: When I played to Slots Empire that time Bangladesh was allowed.</p>
<p>[10:12] Wayne: One moment please.</p>
<p>[10:12] Sayma5566: I don't understand what is going on [10:16] Wayne: The Customer is responsible for reviewing the Terms &amp; Conditions on the Website on a regular basis in order to prevent any misunderstanding or misinterpretation.</p>
<p>[10:16] Wayne: And there was a recent change that Bangladesh is a restricted country in our casino</p>
<p>[10:17] Wayne: Unfortunately, BitCoin deposits are non refundable</p>
<p>[10:18] Sayma5566: So my winnings?</p>
<p>[10:20] Sayma5566: Excuse me</p>
<p>[10:23] Wayne: Such a case occurred that your country became restricted as per our Terms and Conditions, we would love to refund your transaction, but BitCoin deposits are non-reversable. The Slots Empire website reserves the right to change and/or amend these Terms and Conditions whenever required. And by creating an account, the Customer expresses their consent to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions</p>
<p>[10:27] Sayma5566: This is not right at all. Customer will not play in Slots Empire with this kind of risk.Suddenly casinos terms will be change and customer will lost their deposit and winnings. What kind of rules it is? Slots Empire must need to give advance notice to the customer regarding the new rules.So sad.</p>
<p>[10:28] Sayma5566: Anyway, thanks to you for co-operation.</p>
<p>Now I want to complain about this. If they recently restricted Bangladesh so how they simply voided my deposit and winnings?</p>
<p>Is this the proper rules to closed customer account without any advance notification? If it is the rules then isn't it high risk for the player to playing to Slots Empire?</p>
<p>Please try to help me about this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
