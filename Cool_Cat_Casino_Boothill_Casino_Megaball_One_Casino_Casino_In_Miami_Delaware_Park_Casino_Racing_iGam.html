<p>Pragmatic Play’s recently launched sportsbook will leverage ONEPlatform to provide customers with a streamlined managed services solution that fully supports live streaming</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play, a leading provider of game content to the iGaming industry, has formed a new partnership with iGameMedia, a state-of-the-art sports streaming platform. Under the deal, the two parties will deliver ultra-low latency sports streaming through the latter company’s fully integrated streaming solution – ONEPlatform.</p>
<p>The solution allows clients to easily access sports streaming. Integration of iGameMedia’s ONEPlatform solution is seamless, intuitive and easy, requiring no lengthy timelines and change management. The innovative solution empowers the currently popular inplay betting product used by many companies today.</p>
<p>The integrated solution powers clients with a “content gateway” to a plethora of sports content. Furthermore, it allows the industry to tackle a variety of challenges, such as the mapping of IDs from different API sources.</p>
<p>To that end, iGameMedia leverages iGame ONEMap, a product that utilizes a single API instance that exposes the respective IDs of all third-party vendors associated with a live event. Thanks to the clever use of AI and ML tech, the solution is fully automated and highly accurate.</p>
<p>The mapping tool also tackles a challenge such as non-standard team naming conventions. Usually, typical machine processing fails to identify PSG and Paris Saint Germain as the same team, sometimes causing unmapped events that require manual intervention.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s recently launched sportsbook will leverage ONEPlatform to provide customers with a streamlined managed services solution that fully supports live streaming.</p>
<p>In addition to the deal with Pragmatic Play, iGameMedia also boasts agreements with a number of best-in-class providers, such as Genius Sports, IMG Arena, Infront Bettor, Sportradar and StatsPerform.</p>
<p>Representatives Welcomed the Partnership</p>
<p>Representatives praised the new agreement, expressing their excitement about the tie-up. Chris Cousin, iGameMedia’s commercial director, commented on the matter, saying that his team is glad to join forces with Pragmatic Play and back its unrivaled offering.</p>
<p>We are absolutely delighted to have partnered with Pragmatic Play in supporting their unrivaled platform innovation and offering a truly consolidated content approach for the sportsbook market. Chris Cousin, commercial director, iGameMedia</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gareth Crook, Pragmatic Play’s vice president of sports, said that the deal will allow his team to deliver an unparalleled sportsbook product to its clients.</p>
<p>Operators now have access to an unrivaled portfolio of “always on“ official live video streaming content from the world’s highest-profile sports events and competitions. This delivered at ultra-low latency providing an enhanced betting experience to Sportsbook bettors. Gareth Crook, VP of sports, Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>In other news, Pragmatic Play just released Loki’s Riches, a brand new Nordic mythology-themed slot.</p>
