<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) has posted a new report in which it detailed the level of diversion the gambling industry in the United States has been able to achieve, pulling ahead of other sectors, such as hospitality.</p>
<p>According to the report, the gambling industry is well ahead of the targets set for the hospitality industry and has been able to achieve an inclusion level of 61.1% in terms of minorities, compared to just 52% for the hospitality industry in general, and around 42% for the broader US workforce.</p>
<p>The report went even further in establishing the exact groups represented in the gambling industry. According to AGA, 23% of all employees are Hispanic and 19% are Black. The present results are a significant increase in the level of inclusion and diversification of the industry, which went from 20% minority representatives in its workforce in 2011 to 60% of all gaming employees today.</p>
<p>Gaming manufacturers also employ 45% minorities, meaning that the industry has become more inclusive throughout its entire supply chain. AGA President and CEO Bill Miller welcomed this opportunity and said that this was reflective of the fact that policymakers and consumers have become more demanding from businesses in terms of how they contribute to society.</p>
<p>It's not just a matter of securing a tidy bottom line, Miller explained. Another cause for celebration within the industry is that first and mid-level rangers are now 45% minorities, which represents one of the strongest sectors where minorities can realize their full potential, the survey explains.</p>
<p>Miller, though, cautioned that there is still more work to do and that the years to come would show the industryâ€™s true potential of being a truly inclusive workplace and environment. Meanwhile, women's involvement in the workforce was once again very strong with 48% of all people in the gaming workforce represented by female workers.</p>
<p>To reach these results, the American Gaming Association used hard numbers provided to the trade group by 26 of its member organizations, which includes 18 tribal and commercial operators and eight manufacturers.</p>
