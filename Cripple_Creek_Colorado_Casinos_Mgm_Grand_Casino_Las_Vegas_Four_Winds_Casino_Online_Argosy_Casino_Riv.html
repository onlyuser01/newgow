    <h1>Cripple Creek Colorado Casinos Mgm Grand Casino Las Vegas Four Winds Casino Online Argosy Casino Riv</h1>

<p>Spins.lv, a local powerhouse in the Latvian iGaming market, has announced a fresh content alliance with Swintt, a fast-evolving studio that has been able to create some of the most innovation-rich slot games in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>As a result, Spins.lv will be able to consolidate its market-leading position while Swintt will expand its own reach in and provide local players with a range of experiences. Swintt will be delivering its product portfolio through the Select and Premium content portfolios which are designed to bring players maximum satisfaction.</p>
<p>Spins.lv will effectively benefit from both game catalogues, which will allow the brand to rapidly deliver excellent games that are bound to strike home with Latvian player bases. Among the games that will be arriving are some of the most prominent branded titles such as The Crown, which features the likeness and imagery of Vinnie Jones for a true cinematic experience brought to your slot gameplay in real-time.</p>
<p>Spins.lv players will also get their hands on Candy Gold, another fantastic release by the company, along with the Xtra series of games which bring even more innovative gameplay. More games are also coming, as Swintt is expected to release Electric Elements before long which will include four reel modifiers and an option to buy into a Free Spins bonus round, for example.</p>
<p>Swintt CEO David Mann was very happy with the opportunity to see his company’s products expand in the Latvian market and team up with a premium online casino brand while enhancing the operator’s game library. Mann further added:</p>
<p>"With games from both our Select and Premium line-ups now available on the platform, we look forward to strengthening our brand’s relationship with Latvian players by offering them the range of unique themes and innovative bonus features that have become such a hallmark of the Swintt brand."</p>
<p>Spins.lv CEO Arturs Sarma met the partnership on a similarly positive note and said that the company was very happy with the opportunity to team up with Swintt and thus strengthen its position as one of the leading online casino platforms in the fast-developing Latvian market, too. Sarma noted that Swintt’s product offer has developed impressively over what is a very short period of time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Swintt has been working to actively strengthen its business team with the addition of Lars Kollind as Head of Business Development, and not least – the company’s most recent achievement which saw it obtain a license from the UK Gambling Commission, marking another very important entry.</p>
