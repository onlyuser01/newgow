<p>Andrew Bentley is joining Guaselmann’s betting division, Merkur Sportwetten, from House of Edge Consultancy, where he spent the last two years serving as managing director while also consulting Gauselmann’s sports betting business since October 2020.</p>
<p>In his new position as a chief operating officer (COO), Bentley will spearhead growth in the division’s online betting vertical. Bentley quickly detailed his relevant experience in a statement as part of the new company:</p>
<p>“I have spent the last two years working with several online and land-based operators and have really enjoyed the variety of work and exposure to different challenges.” Andrew Bentley, COO, Merkur Sportwetten</p>
<p>Deliver Growth in Core Markets</p>
<p>Bentley will be tasked with the development of online sports betting as the group seeks to grow in its core markets, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Belgium, and Poland. Besides managing the product and operations teams, Andrew Bentley will be responsible for customer support, risk, payments, and fraud divisions, as part of the omnichannel strategy adopted by the group he would be expected to deliver upon.</p>
<p>“I started consulting with Merkur Sportwetten in 2020 and was excited by the ambitious plans for their digital business and the clear strategy to deliver the best possible omnichannel experience to customers. My operational and omnichannel experience is a good match for what the business is trying to achieve, and there is a great team in place that I look forward to working with.” Andrew Bentley, COO, Merkur Sportwetten</p>
<p>‘The Right Person to Fill the Role’</p>
<p>Bentley will continue to be based in a remote working environment in the UK while reporting directly to Mercur Sportwetten CEO Markus Ettlin.</p>
<p>“We have already been able to get to know each other well over the past eight months, during Andy’s work as an external consultant. We are therefore confident that with him, we have found the right person to fill the role of COO.” Markus Ettlin, CEO, Merkur Sportwetten</p>
<p>Prior to joining the consultancy business, Bentley served for nearly two years, from March 2018 to December 2019, as chief executive officer of BGO Group. Bentley also had a period of 9 years with Genting Casinos, where his career peaked as operations director from April 2016 to March 2018.</p>
