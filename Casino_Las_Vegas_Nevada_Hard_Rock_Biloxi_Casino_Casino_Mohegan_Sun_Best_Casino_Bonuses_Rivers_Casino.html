<p>The Asian Poker Tour (APT), which is Asia’s premier poker tour offering a world-class poker experience for the region, was purchased by a newly formed company called APT Events Private Limited. The announcement came Wednesday and sees the ownership of the APT transfer from Asian Poker Tour Limited, an Asianlogic Group Company, after 12 years of operation.</p>
<p>APT Events Purchases the Asian Poker Tour</p>
<p>The APT is one of the most recognizable and famous live poker brands. Since it was founded back in 2008, its popularity within the Asia and Pacific region has been growing continuously. According to APT’s latest announcement, the acquisition will seek further “regional and international expansion.”</p>
<p>Jeff Mann, who spearheaded the APT as chief executive officer for more than a decade will relinquish his position, the brand revealed. However, to ensure a smooth transition, Mann will remain with APT as a primary consultant. On the other hand, Lloyd Fontillas, a twelve-year APT veteran and one of the top tournament directors in the world will spearhead the tournament. Fontillas will serve as executive tournament director and general manager. Similarly, the APT will retain its entire live events team that will be led by Fontillas.</p>
<p>The next APT event is planned to start next week. The APT Vietnam Hanoi Loyal 2022 will start on June 7 and will run through June 19. The prestigious tournament will take place at the Grand Loyal Poker Club, Grand Vista Hotel in Hanoi, Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Will Help the Prestigious Poker Tour Grow</p>
<p>Michael Soyza, a partner at APT Events Private Limited commented that Fontillas and Mann helped APT grow significantly. He added: “All the stakeholders, including myself, have been active participants in the APT for over a decade.” Soyza pointed out that working with the APT team brings excitement. In conclusion, he revealed that APT Events is looking forward to taking the Asian Poker Tour to a new level.</p>
<p>“Jeff (Mann) and Lloyd (Fontillas) have done a tremendous job of building the APT to where it is today.” Michael Soyza, partner at APT Events Private Limited</p>
<p>Mann added that the APT has been looking for an organization that would help it grow even further. He said: “With such a long and rich tradition, it was of the utmost importance that any partnership or sale would only go to an organization with the same passion and dedication to continue developing the Asian Poker Tour as we always envisioned.” Last but not least, Mann revealed that he is excited about the future of the APT.</p>
