    <h1>William Hill Casino Nevada Casinos Niagara Falls Casinos Four Winds Casino South Bend Seneca Resort</h1>

<p>About 3 weeks ago, I asked to withdraw a prize of about 700 Euros to my Neteller account. In the past, the amount always collected arrived the longest in a few days, in some cases even within a few hours, ie the withdrawals were always fast. This time the selection was split, with the first part of the selection arriving at my Neteller within a few days. However, the amount was missing 165 Euros. So I checked my Vulkan Vegas casino account and there was 165 Euros left in the repair history, which was marked as "pending". So I waited about 2 weeks and the payment was still not processed. So about a week ago, I contacted Live Chat support, who told me that I would let colleagues who work with finance know to expedite the withdrawal payment. However, almost another week has passed and the payment is still marked as "pending". I tried to find some email contact for the casino, but I didn't find any on the casino's website. Therefore, I am asking the Casino Guru if it would be possible to contact the casino and solve this selection problem.</p>
<p>Thank you and kind regards,</p>
<p>Miroslav</p>
