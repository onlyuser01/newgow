<p>Finding a Dota 2 betting site that is fit to your taste will require some research. We save you the trouble of all the looking around by listing some of the factors that we use to determine if a Dota 2 betting site actually meets our standards.</p>
<p>Great Market Variety</p>
<p>Dota 2 is one of the most popular esports video games out there. As such, there is no shortage of excellent events. From the i-League to WePlay, to ESL and the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), the competitive scene is a state in constant flux.</p>
<p>We make sure that any betting sites we recommend have made sure to cover the majority of these Dota 2 matches and leagues. That way, you can always have a flexible choice of events and never be forced to make poor bets.</p>
<p>Impeccable Reputation</p>
<p>Esports bettors are unlike any other lot. They are smart, tech-savvy, and with plenty of disposable income. That is why a Dota 2 betting site that is hoping to win more customers would need to be licensed and have a proven track record for meeting Dota 2 fans’ expectations when it comes to betting. We only list the websites that the community has approved of with an overwhelming majority.</p>
<p>Flexible UI and UX</p>
<p>Dota betting can be a lot of fun, but to make it truly worthwhile, you need a website that is intuitive, mobile-friendly, and that allows you to bet quickly. That is why esports betting sites such as Rivalry and Luckbox, for example, will make sure to provide you with a flexible and intuitive user interface (UI).</p>
<p>Dota 2 fans put a great value on the overall website experience, and the best esports betting agencies know how to cater to these preferences. We only recommend Dota 2 sites that can deliver on this and more.</p>
<p>Great Odds Across All Events</p>
<p>Esports fans may be new to the concept of “odds,” but they are not new to the concept of great value. No matter how skilled a Dota 2 fan is, they will always choose those betting sites that bring them the most competitive overall odds.</p>
<p>We study the odds of each Dota 2 betting site carefully ourselves and issue recommendations for each website based on those odds. Overall, Dota fans want a website to offer fair, timely, and beneficial odds, and we hold brands to nothing less.</p>
<p>An Esports-First Focus</p>
<p>Many betting agencies thought that they could use esports to lure video gamers into sports betting. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only did esports fans not budge, but did they also start stealing away sports fans from betting agencies.</p>
<p>Because of this, any esports betting site that launches today must be tailored to the needs of gamers. That is precisely why all great Dota 2 betting sites today focus almost exclusively on video game competitions and only add sports products after they have established a reputation as a great esports “bookmaker.”</p>
