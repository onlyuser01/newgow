    <h1>Slotswin Casino Jakes Casino Paris Casino Parking Casinos In Rancho Mirage Casino Shreveport Hotel J</h1>

<p>On the 28.07.2020 I won a winnings of $7000 after putting in what was over an easy thousand within that same week I decided I would withdrawal my winnings.</p>
<p>I uploaded all ID, my drivers lisence, a recent utility bill with my address, my bank card both front and back along with my bank statment proving my account details were to match what I was wanting my transactions to go into.</p>
<p>All my indentifaction forms were verified and the money was taken from my account, Withing 3 days the money have been reversed back into my account.</p>
<p>On the 31.07.2020 I spoke to a worker named Matthew on live chat who told me my account number did not match what I had used ( X ref number that is always used to make deposites into my account) and that was why it bounced.</p>
<p>He proceeded to tell me of I was to change that simple error that my money wouldgo through, I did as asked and within a day my money was bounced back again into my gaming account.</p>
<p>There has been copious emails back and forth along with live chats with workers by the names of Matthew, Lilly, melany and Jacob who advised me that I needed to provide my bank statement again despite already having it.</p>
<p>So i uploaded my bank statment again ( has been shown now a good 6 times in total) my work pay slip and my screen shot of what bank details my parenting payment all go into via centrelink, all of which were the account I registered this entire time.</p>
<p>They have forwarded my account and this issue further but am always told the same thing " your details aren't correct"</p>
<p>Provide a bank statment etc.</p>
<p>Again, I done so along with contacting my bank to clarify my details were correct.</p>
<p>A worker Jacob on live chat yesterday told me all was correct and that my funds would be released within the 24 hours and to reach my bank Withing 3/5 business days.</p>
<p>Long behold a few hours later I recieve ANOTHER email saying it had failed and they reversed my funds, too again provide a bank statement!!!!!</p>
<p>Today I have gone into my branch, had them print out my details for me, highlight my account details ( which are exactly the same ones I've used now for the the last 10 days) uploaded it and have tried to claim my money again.</p>
<p>I've asked for vairfiaction as there is NOTHING more I can do to provide them with information as they have EVERYTHING showing I am who I say I am along with all the CORRECT details that they continue to say aren't!</p>
<p>I'm going around in circles with them, my patience is starting to wear very thin!</p>
<p>They are happy to take my money ( that might I add is from the account I'm trying to have my winnings go into) but they aren't happy to PAY OUT!!!</p>
<p>I would like my winnings and to not be told my details aren't correct!</p>
