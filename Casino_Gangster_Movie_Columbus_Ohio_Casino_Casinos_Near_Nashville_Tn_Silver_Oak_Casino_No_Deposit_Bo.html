    <h1>Casino Gangster Movie Columbus Ohio Casino Casinos Near Nashville Tn Silver Oak Casino No Deposit Bo</h1>

<p>Wayne, we discussed your case with our team and, unfortunately, we decided to reject this case. The reason is, that you always have to use your own information - your email, your phone number and especially documents issued in your own name, otherwise it is very hard for us (and I believe for casinos as well) to judge cases fairly, and because your boss has account at the casino as well, they found the match in documents and this is most likely why your account was marked as duplicate.</p>
<p>Even in the T&amp;Cs it is mentioned, that you must use your own documents:</p>
<p>"You may be asked to show one or more of the following documents (or additional documents not listed below) to Us to verify your name, address and date of birth:</p>
<p>Proof of ID: A valid photographic identifying document is required in order to process Your first deposit. The ID can be a copy of a valid passport, driver's license or national ID card. Your name, photograph and signature must appear on the copy sent to Us. In some cases, You may be asked to have Your documents signed and stamped by a qualified notary or solicitor as proof of legitimacy.</p>
<p>Proof of address: This can come in the form of a recent utility bill or debit card statement that shows Your full name and address as listed in Your Account."</p>
<p>Sadly, there is not much we can do to support your case at this time. I can only recommend you always using documents that have your data. Sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino and we will try our best to help.</p>
