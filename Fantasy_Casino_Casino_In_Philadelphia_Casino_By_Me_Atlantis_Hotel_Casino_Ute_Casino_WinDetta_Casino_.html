    <h1>Fantasy Casino Casino In Philadelphia Casino By Me Atlantis Hotel Casino Ute Casino WinDetta Casino</h1>

<p>I attach Windetta's request to absolutely reject her accusations. and give me my money back and let me play.</p>
<p>I attach the screen prints where you can see the deposits made from my verified Astropay account, there you can see my data, my verified account, etc.</p>
<p>It is an absolute lie and I ask you to present proof that they sent me an email with the reasons for the closure on August 22. That never happened.</p>
<p>The explanation about the reasons for closing the account that they make is unusual (it is fraud to deposit to play and want to withdraw...????) and I do not understand how they come to the conclusion of fraud, if I deposit money, it is to bet with the hope of winning, and if I do, I hope to be able to withdraw the money, therefore obviously I must play what I deposited 3 times to be able to withdraw it later, when I consider that I won a small part more than what I deposited, I do not understand what it means It's bad to bet to win, isn't it the ABCs of betting??? Why is it seen as fraud that you want to earn a little and withdraw it? How should I do it if you please explain to me, how I deposit...play...win...and withdraw...Windetta, please explain it to me???</p>
<p>I expect a prompt response, there must be a very serious confusion for them to accuse me in that way.</p>
<p>I ask Guru to read my arguments and analyze them please and to read Windetta's vague and obvious arguments carefully and not to publish the prints since there is data from my Astropay account. Thank you</p>
