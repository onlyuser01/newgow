<p>Prairie Meadows Casino, Racetrack and Hotel in Iowa announced today an extension to the stringent mitigation measures aimed at slowing down the further spread of the coronavirus in the state. The extension will be valid through December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>The casino and racetrack operator issued a comprehensive list of measures put in place to prevent the virus transmission at the venue and as part of its initiative to help curb the outbreak.</p>
<p>“It remains our collective responsibility to mitigate and contain this virus for the safety and welfare of our employees, customers, and community in which we serve.” Gary Palmer, President and CEO, Prairie Meadows</p>
<p>Smoking Not Permitted, Masks Mandatory</p>
<p>To optimize personal safety, the gaming establishment will continue with its temporary suspension of all forms of smoking, as for guests, so for employees, to make sure masks are worn properly most of the time.</p>
<p>Wearing a face mask is mandatory at all times and for that reason the venue reduced the number of entry points to the property to allow its staff to monitor the guest admission process to make sure everyone has a proper face covering when entering the venue. Substitutes of face masks such as face shields, neck gaiters and masks with vents will not be permitted inside the property.</p>
<p>Eating Only at Designated Areas</p>
<p>Food consumption will be allowed only at designated areas: the AJ’s Steakhouse, the tables in the Finish Line Show Lounge, the Paddock Grill &amp; Deli, including the tiered seating area near it. According to the Governor’s Proclamation, food and beverage sales inside the venue will stop at 10pm until further notice.</p>
<p>Air Ventilation and Property Sanitization</p>
<p>The casino and racetrack will implement enhanced air ventilation and disinfection procedures to reduce the risk of virus air droplets to survive longer and infect others. The air will be exchanged in full every 15 minutes by utilizing a two-stage filtration process with anti-microbial treatment, while a rigorous cleaning schedule will be in place to sanitize the property using high-grade disinfectants and electrostatic sprayers.</p>
<p>“Our vigilance now will position us for even greater success once it is safer to resume normal, full-scale operations. I am truly grateful for the patience and flexibility that both our team and customers have afforded us during this critical time.” Gary Palmer, President and CEO, Prairie Meadows</p>
<p>The number 1 entertainment destination in Iowa features “nonstop casino action, live and simulcast horse racing, sports wagering, big-name entertainment, local and regional musical acts, and full-service dining amenities”, while its hotel offers guests a convenient place to stay. The property employs nearly 1,300 workers with another 200 added seasonally during the spring and summer months.</p>
