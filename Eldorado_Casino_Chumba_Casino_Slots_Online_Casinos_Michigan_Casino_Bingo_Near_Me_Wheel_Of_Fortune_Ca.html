    <h1>Eldorado Casino Chumba Casino Slots Online Casinos Michigan Casino Bingo Near Me Wheel Of Fortune Ca</h1>

<p>I won $2500 with a clean deposit, no bonuses. I submitted my first withdrawal on 5/31/20 and my limit was $250. I couldn’t believe it since I had withdrawn from them in December of 2019 and my limit was $1000 at that time. My withdrawal back in December was flawless. I received it in just a few short days. It was for $1000. This time my withdrawal experience has been completely different. As mentioned my withdrawal limits were much lower, no idea why, so I had them review it and they raised it to $1000. I had to place 4 withdrawal requests total to get my $2500 winnings. It’s now been 16 business days and I’ve received nothing. In the interim I had received an email on Saturday 6/6/20 ,saying I’d receive my payout in 10-12 working days from that date even though I’d already waited a full week. I’ve tried to talk to customer support and it is the worst in the industry. The literally don’t even answer you even though it says they’ve joined the chat. I have screenshots to show a few of my experiences. Today is the eleventh day since I received the email, the sixteenth day since my first request, and still nothing. Support via email hasn’t answered me on the status yet and in the chat, sometimes they join and sometimes they don’t. Either way, I’ve not been able to get any kind of resolution or response recently. I was initially told withdrawals take 1-7 business days to be paid out but now it’s been 16 business days for no apparent reason.</p>
