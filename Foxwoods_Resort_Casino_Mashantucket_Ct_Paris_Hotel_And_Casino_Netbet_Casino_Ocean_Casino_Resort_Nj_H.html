    <h1>Foxwoods Resort Casino Mashantucket Ct Paris Hotel And Casino Netbet Casino Ocean Casino Resort Nj H</h1>

<p>On 2024-01-17 I played the welcome package at Refuel casino: 4x 250€ deposits with which you received wagerless free spins (but had to wager the deposit once). Afterwards I withdrew my entire balance of 1058.09€.</p>
<p>On 2024-01-18 I received the money, but only 1021.06€ had reached my bank account. At this point I checked their T&amp;C and couldn’t find any mention of a withdrawal fee (unless I wouldn’t have wagered the deposit, which I did do). Since their live support was offline, I contacted their email support, asking them to either show me the relevant part of the T&amp;C justifying the fee, or to refund the missing 37.03€. They haven’t replied to this date.</p>
<p>Later, the live support became available, so I asked them for an explanation of the fee. They claimed that Refuel casino does not charge any fees, but occasionally the bank or the payment provider may charge some. So I contacted my payment provider Brite, and they confirmed that they only received a transaction order of 1021.06€ from the casino.</p>
<p>I contacted the live support again, and another agent replied with the same snippet about the casino not charging any fees, so it seems that the live support has been instructed to lie about the fees. I showed them the Brite email and said that they must have payed me too little by mistake then. They told me that they can’t help any further, and instructed me to contact the payments department in the same email address that I had already tried in the beginning that does not respond.</p>
<p>Note that this fee of 37.03€ came on top of a 5€ fee for each of my deposits. But those I could at least see before confirming the deposits, so I’m not including them in the complaint. But this unannounced large withdrawal fee is completely unjustified, and since there is no mention of it anywhere in the site, I want the casino to refund it to me. It can’t be so that the casino has a right to take an arbitrary amount of money as a transaction fee without announcing it beforehand.</p>
