    <h1>Carnival City Online Casino Hinckley Grand Casino Dreams Casino No Deposit Bonus Betonline Casino Ed</h1>

<p>I want to describe my case as precisely as possible:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I took part in the live casino games of Winfest casino and played a round of two hands poker with a total bet of 24 EUR. I have placed my bets and the round started. I got on both hands bonus games (x7 each) and after I clicked on "call", that means I have played this hand, my screen stopped and the round was not evaluated and my bets and winnings were not credited. Directly after this occurs, I contacted the live support of the live casino and they confirmed that there were some irregularities and they provided me with a ticket no. (see attachment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some days left, I contacted live chat of winfest and they told me, that they dont know about my issue at all and the ticket number is wrong /they dont use such ticket numbers and it must be a mix-up and I must have played in a different casino. I only thought: ok, interessting story, telll me more about it. Whats going on here? You are running a online casino and dont know about your own business? You let customer play at live casino and want to explain that there is no case here despite I provide them with a screenshot of the conversation with live chat with ticket no.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several more days left and left and I became angry. At the end, someone from live- chat of Winfest told me that they will contact live casino to get more information about my case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After several weeks they informed me that my bets of 24 EUR were returned and there will be no additional winnigs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So let me summerize my issue: I played, I won, live casino worked perfect (round was not cancelled) and after a lot of weeks they provides me with such a answer?</p>
<p>I think Winfest should calculate my winnings according the mentioned live-casino game round and pay me out my winnings. The named live casino round was not cancelled by live casino so the round was valid.</p>
<p>Until today, Winfest dont offer me adequat customer support.</p>
