    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Restaurants Casino In Scottsdale Pittsburgh Casinos Santa Claran Hotel Casino Espa</h1>

<p>The provider of daily fantasy sports betting markets has obtained a new license to launch in Indiana, bringing an excellent range of opportunities for fans</p>
<p>As a result, PrizePicks will be able to offer a range of experiences for sports aficionados in the state, including American football and basketball, which are quite popular already.</p>
<p>Fantasy Sports and Esports Heading to Indiana with PrizePicks</p>
<p>Apart from this, PrizePicks will also bring fantasy betting options for competitive video games, such as Counter-Strike and League of Legends, providing various demographics and bettors with a full 360-degree experience across the board.</p>
<p>This is possible through the temporary license granted to the company by the Indiana Gaming Commission, which will allow PrizePicks to start scaling up its offer locally. There are a number of skill-based DFS games for sports fans to try, including products based on Formula 1, the NBA, MLB, and the NFL.</p>
<p>There is a big emphasis being put on the NBA as the state is home to some of the most prominent association franchises, including the Indiana Pacers, and the WNBAâ€™s Indiana Fever.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, PrizePicks Chief Legal Officer &amp; Head of Public Policy Jason Barclay welcomed the chance to see his company roll out its products and portfolio in the state:</p>
<p>We are extremely grateful to the Indiana Gaming Commission for their collaboration and we hope that this license can be a model for other states with competitive gaming markets. PrizePicks Chief Legal Officer &amp; Head of Public Policy Jason Barclay</p>
<p>PrizePicks has been pushing hard in the United States, signing up several prominent partnerships with sports organizations and topflight franchises and teams.</p>
<p>Recent deals the company negotiated included one with Atlanta Braves, an MLB team, and NASCAR. Meanwhile, Indiana Sen. Jon Ford welcomed the opportunity to see yet another company enter the DFS space in the state. Sen. Ford has championed the development of fantasy sports in Indiana, including the introduction of more betting options.</p>
<p>Fantasy sports has long been the only form of regulated sports betting in the United States, with this changing after 2018 when PASPA was overturned by the US Supreme Court, and commercial gambling on traditional sports was allowed on a state-by-state basis.</p>
