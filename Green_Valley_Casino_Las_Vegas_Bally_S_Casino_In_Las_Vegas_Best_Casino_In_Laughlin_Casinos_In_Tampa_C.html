<p>The new deal is the latest for the fast-growing gaming content provider operating out of Bulgaria</p>
<p>Provider of gaming content and software solutions to the online casino industry CT Interactive announced its global footprint has expanded after an agreement with online casino platform TimelessTech.</p>
<p>Access to New Global Markets</p>
<p>The content deal CT Interactive signed with one of the fastest-growing iGaming platforms is set to expand its presence into new global markets, utilizing TimelessTech’s access to these markets due to the platform’s Curacao license.</p>
<p>Head of business development for the EMEA region at CT Interactive, Milena Tsankarska, and director of Business Development for the Americas, Martin Ivanov, commented on the development on behalf of the content provider, expressing their view on the agreement.</p>
<p>“We are proud that we have signed a deal with an operator as successful as TimelessTech,” said Tsankarska, hailing TimelessTech’s team of experts, boasting years of industry experience and being extremely devoted to their work.</p>
<p>Ivanov, on the other side, focused on the strategic aspect of the deal in his comments, stating that “through this platform [the company’s] products will reach new important markets in the gaming world.”</p>
<p>“CT Interactive is very a well-known and respected company in the sector,” commented Nicola Cainero, chief operating officer of TimelessTech, eager for the partnership to commence.</p>
<p>A subsidiary of Telematic Interactive Bulgaria AD, the operator of one of the largest casino and sports betting platforms, Palms Bet, and the first gaming company in the country to go live on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange, CT Interactive has been active on the partnership front throughout December.</p>
<p>Expanding Presence in Europe and Latin America</p>
<p>The month began with a deal with Paraguay-based website operator Slots Del Sol that saw CT Interactive expand the operator’s portfolio with 60 of its games and the Hot Luck Jackpot, and continued with new game titles additions and Jackpot certifications in Colombia and Spain.</p>
<p>Midway through the month, CT Interactive sealed a milestone deal with Microgame to increase its market reach in Italy and then added more Italy presence via a deal with MondoGaming to provide the operator with 20 of its games and a 3-level jackpot.</p>
<p>In the second half of December, CT Interactive signed a deal with Planet Gaming NV to expand its product reach with several new markets and then switched its focus to Gibraltar and Malta: first, the content provider received certification as a software provider for Pariplay from the Gibraltar Gaming Commission and then, announced a deal with IZIBET to expand its presence in Malta.</p>
