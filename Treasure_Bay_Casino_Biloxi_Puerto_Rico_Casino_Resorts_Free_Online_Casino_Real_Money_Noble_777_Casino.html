<p>GambleAware, one of the leading charities in the United Kingdom, and the National Health Service (NHS), have reaffirmed their commitment to tackling problem gambling, raising awareness for the issue, and researching new and better ways to aid those who need assistance.</p>
<p>The NHS has been one of the many partners that GambleAware has collaborated with in order to achieve its ambitious goals in aiding at-risk and problem gamblers. This comes a month after GambleAware confirmed that it had collected £46.5m in donations from the industry.</p>
<p>In a statement, the two organizations agreed to continue to collaborate closely in order to make it possible to reach their shared goal and vision of a better tomorrow in which players are not falling victim to problem gambling or, when they do, they have adequate help at their disposal to help them return back to their normal lives.</p>
<p>National Clinical Advisor on Gambling Harms for the NHS England Prof. Henrietta Bowden-Jones OBE has welcomed the opportunity to collaborate with the organization and extend their meaningful relationship. She similarly said her organization supported the Gambling White Paper, particularly in the section that plans to introduce a Statutory Levy on gambling companies’ revenues in order to fund treatment and research programs.</p>
<p>Research has become a watershed for the industry, as more scientific data is needed to ensure that consumers are getting the best help possible and that lawmakers are making the most sustainable and robust decisions in the long term.</p>
<p>Until a levy is introduced though, Prof. Bowden-Jones OBE has confirmed that the NHS and GambleAware will continue to work together to ensure that they help patients in need of treatment. She added:</p>
<p>"The NHS has no wish to be the sole provider of all gambling treatment at a national level, on the contrary, it is committed to working with non-statutory providers of gambling treatment across the country."</p>
<p>The statement was naturally well-received by GambleAware CEO Zoë Osmond who said that the two organizations have had a positive and constructive working relationship that is now set to continue. GambleAware has commissioned the National Gambling Support Network to ensure that it continues to connect those in need with relevant specialists.</p>
<p>GambleAware has been looking into particular issues that are relevant to the industry, including how addiction and gambling companies affect and target women, for example.</p>
<p>Osmond too agreed that a Statutory Levy on the industry would certainly help with the stability of funding, and it will allow researchers and programs that help consumers tackle problem gambling to plan ahead and have a meaningful impact on individuals.</p>
