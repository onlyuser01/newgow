<p>eCOGRA has announced the opening of a new office in Denver, Colorado, as well as the appointment of Daniel Remmes as the new US director of compliance</p>
<p>The 2003-founded, globally renowned independent testing agency with headquarters in the United Kingdom, eCOGRA, has announced its plans to open a new office in Denver, Colorado.</p>
<p>The agency specializing in the comprehensive assessment, inspection, and certification of online gambling systems and software also appointed Daniel Remmes as the new US director of compliance, as part of the same strategic plan to strengthen its foothold in the US.</p>
<p>The New Office, a US-Based Hub for eCOGRA</p>
<p>The fresh office in Colorado will play the role of a hub for the agency’s operations in the US, naturally following the rising demand for its services as triggered by the fast growth of the iGaming industry on the North American continent.</p>
<p>The Denver office will provide support to clients, with random number generator assessments, software testing, cybersecurity evaluations, and reviews of regulatory compliance on top of the list.</p>
<p>eCOGRA’s chief executive officer, Shaun McCallaghan, expressed their thrill about the expansion of their operations in the US as well as confidence in the fact that their “presence in Colorado will play a pivotal role” in their overall growth.</p>
<p>Also commenting on Daniel Remmes’ appointment, the CEO described it as “an outstanding addition” to their team thanks to his expansive experience and “invaluable” knowledge related to the online gambling market in the US, both of which are expected to help them navigate the new and exciting chapter.</p>
<p>Remmes, “Thrilled to Begin This New Role”</p>
<p>Remmes, who has gathered more than 10 years of iGaming regulation and compliance experience with iconic names like PlayUp Limited, IGT, and the Carousel Group, also took the opportunity to express his excitement regarding his appointment.</p>
<p>He also stated that he was “thrilled to begin this new role with eCOGRA” and be able to seize the opportunity to work with the agency’s talented crew.</p>
<p>The new director of compliance acknowledged eCOGRA’s reputable position as a “leading internationally accredited testing agency” while saying he was looking forward to leveraging his decade-old experience in iGaming compliance to guarantee that all regulatory issues and customer initiatives are given the importance they deserve.</p>
<p>eCOGRA, which is the regulatory audit partner to 200+ multi-jurisdictional operators and software providers in the online gambling industry plans to use its expansion in the US as “a testament to the company’s ongoing commitment to promoting integrity and best practices” in the industry.</p>
<p>Thanks to its newly set up office and team of experts, eCOGRA is in the position to provide its “world-class services to a wider range of clients” while continuing its mission to guarantee fair and responsible gambling.</p>
<p>A year ago, in January 2023, eCOGRA entered the Michigan market as an independent testing lab. In August 2023, the agency issued certification to WinSpirit.</p>
