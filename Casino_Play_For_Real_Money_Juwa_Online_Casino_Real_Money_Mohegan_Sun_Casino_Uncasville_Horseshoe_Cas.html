<p>PokerStars is hosting another online poker event in New Jersey in April, 2020. The Spring Championship of Online Poker (SCOOP) will run with $1.2m in guaranteed prize pool.</p>
<p>New Jersey to See Another Poker Stars SCOOP in April</p>
<p>Spring is around the corner and PokerStars’ next big event is a short wait away. The Spring Championship of Online Poker (SCOOP) is returning around the world and, in the United States, players from New Jersey and Pennsylvania will get a chance to test their mettle in a fiery online poker battle.</p>
<p>While offshore has dominated the American poker sector, PokerStars is giving outstanding opportunities to participate in a major event. PASCOOP, as the event focusing on Pennsylvania is known, will offer $2 million in guarantees and run from April 4 through April 20 with 50 tournaments on schedule.</p>
<p>New Jersey Spring Championship of Online Poker returns April 11-27, $1.2M in guarantees. More about #NJSCOOP 2020: https://t.co/B8U0PGcGKn pic.twitter.com/9nWFvAJOMC — PokerStarsBlog (@PokerStarsBlog) March 26, 2020</p>
<p>The New Jersey version of the event will come a little while after, kicking off on April 11 and running through April 27 with 48 tournaments and a smaller prize pool at $1.2 million. NJSCOOP 2020, however, is an improvement on last year’s event when the prize pool stood at $1 million and there were only 41 events.</p>
<p>PokerStars seems to be betting harder on Pennsylvania expecting bigger interest in the Keystone State and focusing advertising efforts there. New Jersey is still going to get its own fair share.</p>
<p>The events are likely to scoop up bigger interest this year due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak that has placed many states on lockdown and suspended most economic activity or relocated it to people’s homes.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and New Jersey remain the two states in which PokerStars has been running extensive online tournaments. However, the company has recently signed a deal in Michigan, after Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed online poker into the law earlier last year.</p>
<p>How to Get into JSCOOP Satellites and What Promotions Are There?</p>
<p>Typical to any PokerStars events, players aren’t expected to cough-up the buy-in upfront. Instead, the company is giving players a fair chance to qualify on skill alone. PokerStarsNJ is planning on a number of a number of qualifier rounds.</p>
<p>The Special Edition Spin &amp; Go’s will cost you $3 to enter and they will run through April 26, offering you plenty of time to make your way into the main event. These events also come with a prize pool that ranges from $6 to $12, but also have some high versions that could grant you access into the Main Event.</p>
<p>With $2 million in guarantees, #PASCOOP begins April 4!</p>
<p>♠️ 50 events across High and Low buy-in tiers</p>

<p>Apart from it, there is the NJSCOOP Main Event Depositor Freeroll which will take place on April 26. Every player who has made a deposit worth at least $30 by April 26 could get a chance to qualify for the Main Event, with 30 seats to go out.</p>
<p>For all players who have registered and deposited in a NJSCOOP tournament, there will also be the NJSCOOP Second Chance All-In Shootout running from April 12 through April 26, with a shot to win $1,000 in each mini-tournament.</p>
