<p>BetMGM, one of the biggest sports betting and iGaming operators and brands in the United States, has recapped the year 2023 in jackpots. The company said that it had been able to pay out $138.2m to lucky devils all throughout 2023 from its progressive jackpot offer, marking a significant 32% jump in the amounts paid on an annual basis, Casino Guru News learnt in a press email release.</p>
<p>Among the titles that drove this trend were such player-favorite choices as MGM Grand Millions, Bison Fury, and more. The games are available across the brand’s online gaming platforms in several states, including New Jersey, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Ranking the five highest payout throughout the year, though, New Jersey held the first three places.</p>
<p>BetMGM paid out $3m on Bison Fury in New Jersey, the largest single-hit jackpot on record, followed by another $2.8m one on MGM Grand Millions in New Jersey. Another big payout came out from Luck O’ The Jackpot for $2.4m in New Jersey as well. Two more jackpots that broke the seven-figure threshold were hit in Michigan on MGM Grand Millions with $1.3m and $1.1m payouts respectively.</p>
<p>The $3m jackpot won in New Jersey was flipped off a $2 bet that led to a life-changing payout. Among the games that pay out jackpots as part of the jackpot network are Bison Fury, Mirage Mega Magma, Loot’En Khamun, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and more.</p>
<p>BetMGM VP of Gaming Angus Nisbet was very happy with the development and said that it demonstrated the company’s commitment to bringing players outstanding products across the board.</p>
<p>"The performance of our exclusive, in-house-produced games shows these titles are resonating with players and solidifies BetMGM as the destination for progressive jackpots," Nisbet added.</p>
<p>In total, BetMGM paid out the biggest jackpots in Michigan, even though New Jersey players turned out to be luckier. Michigan saw the company award $53.2m in total jackpots last year, followed closely by New Jersey with $38.8m, and Pennsylvania with $34.6m. Ontario, Canada came in forth with $6.1m and West Virginia added another $5.4m.</p>
<p>BetMGM is hoping to improve on last year’s results and mark another significant increase in the total amount paid out as jackpots in 2024, the company concluded.</p>
