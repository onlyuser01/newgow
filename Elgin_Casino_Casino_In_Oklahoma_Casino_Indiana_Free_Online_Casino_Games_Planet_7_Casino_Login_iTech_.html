    <h1>Elgin Casino Casino In Oklahoma Casino Indiana Free Online Casino Games Planet 7 Casino Login iTech</h1>

<p>iTech Labs, one of the biggest testing and certification companies in iGaming, has announced the departure of its managing director and CEO Kiren Sreekumar who served for 19 years on the job. The executive’s withdrawal was confirmed as effective on October 11, 2023, the company said in an official statement, also announcing the promotion of Alvin Rizaldi to the helm of the company.</p>
<p>Rizaldi is no chance pick either, as he has been with the company since 2007, shortly after its creation in 2004. He has helped steer the company’s growth and execute crucial strategies linked to its expansion and profitability. Over his 16 years of experience, he held various positions within the company, becoming familiar with its ethos and goals.</p>
<p>His experience includes roles that have to do with revenue and commercial growth, compliance, delivery, and more. Rizaldi is a recognizable face on the company’s client list, and he has become a representative for iTech Labs in the gambling industry. Prior to stepping into his position as CEO, Rizaldi held a role as the company’s Chief Commercial Officer which he has now vacated.</p>
<p>As to Sreekumar, the man was part of the company’s history for almost two decades and since its creation. He has been one of the key people to help iTech Labs become a leading powerhouse and expand its offices and premises in both Bulgaria and India. As a result of his continued efforts, iTech Labs is synonymous with trust and authenticity in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Rizaldi has hailed the opportunity to now take the reins at iTech Labs, thanking Sreekumar for his hard and continuous work. "It is a privilege to be given the opportunity to lead this great organization," Rizaldi noted. Rizaldi is indeed in a very strong position to ensure the continued success of his company for many years to come, iTech Labs noted in their statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rivals such as BMM Testlabs have also been busy reorganizing their internal structures. BMM appointed Julien Pottiez as Vice President of Security of Europe and South America this month, and the company also confirmed Zeena Rossouw as SVP of Africa in August.</p>
