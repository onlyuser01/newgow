<p>The sportsbook continues to expand its clout in soccer</p>
<p>Unique fan opportunities emerge as a result</p>
<p>Liverpool is the latest partner to technology and betting company 1xBet, with the pair signing a multi-year agreement.</p>
<p>Liverpool and 1xBet Enter Multi-Year Partnership</p>
<p>Liverpool FC has teamed up with 1xBet, a betting agency and a technology company that will collaborate with the English Premier League (EPL) champions over the next several years. As a result, 1xBet will become the official Liverpool’s official sponsor, allowing fans access to specific tailor-made promotions.</p>

<p>Liverpool also came a hairbreadth away from landing a victory in the EPL as well, but Manchester City beat them with a few points. Yet, the team remains in good form and according to Jurgen Klopp, the charismatic FC manager, Liverpool will be contesting both titles again in 2019/2020.</p>
<p>1xBet’s Partnerships in Soccer Continue</p>
<p>1xBet’s chief interest remains focused on sports betting and other iGaming verticals, with the company running live casino tables and online slots. Liverpool is well aware of the main business 1xBet operates, but this hasn’t dissuaded the team from seeking closer ties with the company. Here is what Liverpool Managing Director and CCO Billy Hogan had to say:</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome 1XBET to Liverpool FC as our newest partner. I know that their games and special offers will appeal to our fans around the world and we look forward to seeing these as we go into the new 2019-20 season.”</p>
<p>1xBet Affiliate Manager and spokesperson, Alex Sommers, also commented on the newly-struck partnership, recognizing Liverpool as one of the leading teams in the world. Mr. Sommers further added that as result of the partnership, fans were now poised to benefit from what was described as 1xBet’s “supercharged betting experience.”</p>

<p>Understandably, Mr. Sommers said that the company was proud of having added such a landmark partner and 1xBet was looking forward to coming up with unique offers moving forward.</p>
<p>Before teaming up with Liverpool, 1xBet sealed two other important deals, to name a partnership with FC Barcelona. 1xBet became the global sponsor for the team just last week, which yet to exhaust the company’s list of partnerships.</p>
<p>Liverpool is not the first EPL team that 1xBet works with. Tottenham Hotspur are also affiliated with the company and so is the Italy’s Serie A. 1xBet has also been listed as the official sponsor to the African Cup of Nations (CAF).</p>
