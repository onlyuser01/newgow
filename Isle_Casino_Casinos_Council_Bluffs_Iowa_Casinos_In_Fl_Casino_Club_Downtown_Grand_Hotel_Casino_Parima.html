    <h1>Isle Casino Casinos Council Bluffs Iowa Casinos In Fl Casino Club Downtown Grand Hotel Casino Parima</h1>

<p>Hey Nick.</p>
<p>The verification process has been going on since August 22, 2022. I sent all the documents that I was asked for (this is a passport photo and a selfie with a passport) on August 22. It's actually a recheck. The first verification was already 3 years ago.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know which documents are approved and which are not, because no one from parimatch contacted me for a month and a half.</p>
<p>I myself wrote to the support chat many times and each time received almost the same answers. Below is a copy of the latest correspondence:</p>
<p>Maria (02.10.2022, 11:57:20): We are already in the chat and ready to help you.</p>
<p>Maria (10/02/2022, 11:57:36 AM): Please enter your betting account number.</p>
<p>(02.10.2022, 11:58:21): 3035644</p>
<p>Maria (10/02/2022, 11:59:41 AM): Your request has previously been forwarded to the experts and is under review. You will be informed about the results in a written request 14625372.</p>
<p>According to the rules of the company, clause 85, the terms for verifying a gaming account are set individually for each gaming account.</p>
<p>More details about the rules: https://parimatch.com/ru/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>(10/02/2022, 12:00:22): the same thing was written back in August and no one wrote me anything</p>
<p>Maria (10/02/2022, 12:00:37 PM): However, at the moment, specialists are still verifying your account.</p>
<p>(10/02/2022, 12:00:49 PM): how much longer to wait?</p>
<p>Maria (02.10.2022, 12:02:20): It is not possible to provide exact dates, please wait for a response to your mail.</p>
<p>(10/02/2022, 12:03:49 PM): Well, it can't be. the standard verification period in any casino is from 3 minutes to a day. if your verification lasts for months, there should be a warning in the rules about this. and the maximum period</p>
<p>(02.10.2022, 12:04:17): why is there no warning about the wildest timing of this procedure?</p>
<p>Maria (10/02/2022, 12:06:19 PM): According to the company's rules, clause 85, the terms for verifying a game account are set individually for each game account.</p>
<p>(10/02/2022, 12:06:31 PM): why did you write this?</p>
<p>(10/02/2022, 12:07:32 PM): A solid organization cannot have such rules. because it turns out I just gave you money. because you can answer the same thing in 10 years</p>
<p>(02.10.2022, 12:07:37): the term is individual</p>
<p>(02.10.2022, 12:07:51): what should I do with this phrase that the term is individual?</p>
<p>(10/02/2022, 12:08:05): you can not pay at all, but this is copy-paste and that's it</p>
<p>(10/02/2022, 12:09:29 PM): I've been waiting for some ridiculous re-verification for a month and a half. why do I even need it?</p>
<p>Maria (10/02/2022, 12:12:35 PM): Konstantin, there is no maximum verification period.</p>
<p>In this last correspondence, I tried to talk to her in order to get at least some information about what was happening. Prior to that, many times they simply answered with a clause of the rules that the verification period is individual and the queue for verification is long (copy-paste) and that's it.</p>
<p>For me, this is not some critical amount, but a matter of principle. I am upset by this situation as I have lost one of my favorite entertainment games in the casino. All these months and a half I have not played in the casino because now I understand that the winnings may simply not be paid out, what's the point then? üôÅ</p>
<p>Best regards Konstantin</p>
