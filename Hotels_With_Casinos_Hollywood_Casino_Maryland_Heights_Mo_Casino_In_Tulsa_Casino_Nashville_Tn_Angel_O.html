<p>Aruze Gaming opened a new Netherlands-based headquarters that will serve the company’s clients in the EMEA region</p>
<p>Aruze Gaming has made a foray into Europe with an office in the Netherlands. The leading developer of gambling entertainment solutions will leverage the new office to provide service support to the company’s customers in the EMEA region.</p>
<p>Aruze Unveils a European HQ</p>
<p>From now on, the Dutch office will serve as the company’s European HQ, Aruze announced. The company noted that the launch of the new office comes in the wake of increased sales and installations of Aruze products in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The new office will, therefore, serve these regions, providing the manufacturer’s clients with the support they need.</p>
<p>According to Aruze Gaming, this focused regional approach is something that the company hopes to capitalize on as its products grow in popularity. The new office also attests to the manufacturer’s ambition to grow into a global provider of casino solutions.</p>
<p>Aruze Gaming is famous for providing solutions tailored to the needs of a huge variety of casino players. The company offers classic games such as Lucky Roulette, ETGs like BlackJack and many modern iGaming titles.</p>
<p>One of the brand’s flagship solutions is the proprietary Activ-Play technology and the casino-arcade hybrid games it powers. These games leverage the same tech used in the development of slots. However, the main difference is that they are much more engaging, opting for an arcade playstyle.</p>
<p>The New Office Will Help Aruze Connect with Local Clients</p>
<p>The office will be inaugurated by four Aruze team members but the company plans to further expand the local team within the next few months.</p>
<p>David Meacher, Aruze Gaming Europe’s director of business operations, spoke about the opening of the new office. He reasserted that the European HQ came amid rapid expansion for Aruze in EMEA. Meacher noted that the team will allow the manufacturer to strengthen its ties with local clients.</p>
<p>Our customers are invaluable to us, and bringing ourselves that much closer to them will strengthen our relationship and understanding of these specific markets, as well as provide more in-depth and personalized service and sales support. David Meacher, director of business operations, Aruze Gaming Europe</p>
<p>As Aruze expands in Europe, it plans to bring more of its signature luxury cabinets to the region. The provider will continue to supply local operators with its state-of-the-art machines, including cabinets such as the Muso Curve 43 and 55, and Muso Triple 27 and 32, which all provide thrilling gaming experiences.</p>
<p>Aruze concluded its announcement with a reminder that its products will be displayed at booth S9-330 at ICE 2023.</p>
