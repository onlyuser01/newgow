<p>As per SIS’ newest partnership in Latin America, the company will become Gran Premio Hipódromo’s title sponsor. As one of the most important South American racing calendar events, the deal will substantially bolster the developer’s exposure in the region, hopefully presenting new growth opportunities. The agreement also reaffirms SIS’s commitment to horse racing as an integral part of its offerings.</p>
<p>The Chilean Gran Premio Hipódromo represents a perfect sponsorship opportunity for SIS thanks to its lasting popularity across Latin America. According to the new contract, the primary race on 29 April will be named the Clásico SIS. Hipódromo Chile race manager Beltran Montt noted that the upcoming event represented the peak of Chilean racing history, thanking SIS for their patronage.</p>
<p>SIS is a highly valued partner, and we are pleased to have their support to make the day special for all our stakeholders. Beltran Montt, Hipódromo Chile race manager</p>
<p>This sponsorship builds on SIS’ ambitions to bolster its Latin American presence. In February, the supplier strengthened its partnership with the Valparaíso Sporting Club track, another of Chile’s high-profile horse racing destinations. SIS Content Services VP Michele Fischer reaffirmed the company’s commitment to supporting the region’s horse racing scene, encouraging more quality content for fans worldwide.</p>

<p>SIS’ partnership with Hipódromo Chile also has a long-term component, allowing the supplier to distribute the track’s content to its global network of sportsbook partners. Horse racing is a cornerstone offering, thanks to agreements with tracks and clubs across the globe. The supplier takes every opportunity to expand its portfolio, as evidenced by its recent inclusion of six Italian racetracks.</p>
<p>SIS Continues to Excel Worldwide</p>
<p>SIS is well-known for its aggressive growth-oriented strategy, aiming to deliver quality content bolstered with its unique wagering-focused solution. The company’s integrated products offer live streaming with betting triggers and on-screen pricing information. A recent successful foray into eSports further cemented SIS’s position as one of the premier global content suppliers.</p>
<p>A wide-spanning network of sportsbook partners is a testament to SIS’ over three decades of experience. Despite its age, the company still enjoys substantial momentum, demonstrated by its latest deal with Polish operator Go+bet. The deal marked SIS’ first foray into the country, bringing its premium greyhound and horse racing content to an eager new audience.</p>
