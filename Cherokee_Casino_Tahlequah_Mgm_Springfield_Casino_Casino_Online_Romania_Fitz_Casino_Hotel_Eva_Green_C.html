<p>Asia’s game distribution leader, QTech Games, has launched a new feature, Network Progressive Jackpot, which is expected to lead to higher player retention and engagement.</p>
<p>QTech Introduces Network Progressive Jackpot Feature</p>
<p>Network Progressive Jackpot is the first rewards feature in the industry, launched by QTech Games. It is available for 28 Blueprint Gaming jackpot games from the Jackpot King Deluxe system such as Grand (Jackpot King), Major (Regal), and Mini (Royal). It is well-known in the industry worldwide that jackpots are the drive of player retention.</p>
<p>The Network Progressive Jackpots are accumulated from a small percentage of the players’ qualifying bets. They are added to the progressively growing reward fund. The Jackpots are shared between several casinos, which is definitely tempting to players. The feature can be beneficial for established and rising operators. If they join the progressive jackpot pool, they would be required to have bottomless liquidity.</p>
<p>QTech Games’ goal is to provide top-quality content optimization for local distribution to both existing and potential clients. The company continues to attract more and more brands. Along with this breakthrough feature, QTech adds to its suite of progressive products, machine-learning software that has winning triggers. It aims to provide an authentic, trustworthy, and real digital end-user retention system.</p>
<p>QTech’s partners can check the jackpot details, payout values, and contributions through the user-friendly back-office functionality. Its API allows managers to see the real-time balance in any currency, game or prize-pool info, and jackpot ID.</p>
<p>Network Progressive Jackpots Are a Part of the ‘Rewards Tide to Help Lift All Boats’</p>
<p>QTech is on a mission to revolutionize the market. The company recently brought Evolution to Asia as part of its market growth strategy. By signing up for this deal with the premier content provider, QTech brought its full suite of live casino games to Asia.</p>
<p>The CCO at QTech Games, Ulf Norder, stated that the company is a premier platform for developing markets, but there is much more to it. QTech provides value and a driving force to the industry in every possible way. The progressive jackpot system based on the accumulation of player’s bets would act as an acquisition booster for many operators.</p>
<p>From Asia to Eastern Europe and Latin America, QTech expands its reach, providing an immersive gaming experience on a wide range of markets. Last year, the company struck a deal with Spearhead Studios, which gained access to QTech Games markets across continents.</p>
<p>Norder also said that operators understand the importance of progressive jackpots and see them as effective marketing tools. He said that the company is happy to see how the breakthrough feature, Network Progressive Jackpot makes players come back, wanting more of the great titles within a top-quality portfolio of a wide range of well-known suppliers.</p>
<p>According to him, the company’s leading position on the market is ensured. They are the only aggregator with propriety technology and innovative features such as AI-powered recommendation engine and Tournament and Jackpot elements. The Network Progressive Jackpots are only a part of the company’s “innovative rewards tide that helps lift all boats.”</p>
