    <h1>Venetian Casino Las Vegas Lincoln Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Casino In Louisiana Mohegan Sun Casi</h1>

<p>The company, which is focused on bringing streamers and casino players, and audiences, closer together has revealed a new content partnership with content aggregator EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>Livespins and EveryMatrix Ready to Bring More Engagement to Slot Players</p>
<p>The distribution deal will enable both companies to benefit from their reach, diverse content offer, and significant reach in the industry. Thanks to this tie-up, companies that already work with EveryMatrix and provide content from its aggregation solution will be able to take the experience a not further through the integration of Livespins.</p>
<p>The Livespins platform can be injected directly into their gaming lobbies, giving players access to a previously unseen product that has been popularized by Livespins. Slot streaming is taken to the next level by the company which now allows players to watch games in progress while participating themselves.</p>
<p>Not only this, but Livespins provides a fully-compliant platform and product which makes its integration even simpler. Players are able to bet on the outcome of the reels in real time and further enhance the experience and their sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Livespins has taken care of improving social interaction across the board as well. Players are free to choose how many spins they want to bet on and what amounts they are willing to stake. Audiences can further have a chat with the streamer and share emojis and reactions, not unlike how other streaming platforms such as Twitch work.</p>
<p>Going Mainstream and a Strong Start of the Year</p>
<p>All of this means the shared experience is even more impactful. Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen welcomed the opportunity to team up with yet another prominent company from the sector and added that the alliance with EveryMatrix will help launch the platform into the mainstream without further delays. He explained:</p>
<p>The worlds of casino and streaming have been converging for some time now, and player demand for this type of content and experience is at an all-time high. Livespins allows operators to leverage this but in a way that is responsible and compliant. Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen</p>
<p>The partnership is no doubt a significant milestone, Pederson explained, and a fantastic way to begin the new year. EveryMatrix CasinoEngine COO Amund Stensland was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that operators are going to be able to engage with what he described as the next generation of players.</p>
<p>“This is a great addition to our offering and further establishes EveryMatrix as the go-to platform provider for operators looking to stand out from the crowd,” Stensland confirmed. Livespins has signed a number of partnerships over the past months, most recently with hub88 and Campeón Gaming.</p>
