<p>Real Time Gaming’s Jackpot Piñatas Deluxe is now part of an ongoing promotion at Intertops Casino with the progressive jackpot game starting at $250,000.</p>
<p>Intertops Launches Seasonal RTG Slot and Promo</p>
<p>Real Time Gaming has launched its latest title, Jackpot Piñatas Deluxe, on Intertops Casino with a progressive jackpot waiting to be won by lucky players. With just a few days left on the $240,000 Spring Meadows contest that will carry on through May 3, RTG’s new title is a worthwhile replacement to anyone going after a decent bit of fun and a sizable win.</p>
<p>The fiesta is available at Intertops Casino Red, with the jackpot amount starting at $250,000 and giving players an incentive to try their hand at it. Intertops is adding a $5,000 bonus to help players join the Jackpot Piñatas and see if they can turn it around into a massive payout.</p>
<p>The bonus is available in exchange for a minimum deposit of $20, matched at $150. Intertops Casino is equally excited about the opportunity to be bringing a new jackpot title to its players, with the festive new game putting a unique twist on an old Mexican tradition.</p>
<p>Intertops Casino has been known for its seasonal approach to promotions, bringing fresh options almost monthly and for every big holiday out there.</p>
<p>Jackpot Piñatas Deluxe’s Ins and Outs</p>
<p>Jackpot Piñatas Deluxe proves a flexible choice for players looking to enjoy worthwhile gameplay with the slot sporting high volatility and a traditional 20-payline setup. The jackpot resets to $250,000 every time a jackpot is won with no cap on the maximum possible amount.</p>
<p>In order to trigger a jackpot payment, players must hit the five Bull Piñata symbols. The game’s Sombrero Piñata serves as a scatter symbol that will allow players to pick two out of three symbols and lead to potential prizes that could be worth 200x your original bet.</p>
<p>The Star Piñata is the game’s wild feature that will make up for any missing symbol. The Pick Bonus feature activated with the Sombrero Piñata is not the only one. You may enjoy another similar feature that can lead to 25 free spins.</p>
<p>Stick around for the $240,000 Spring Meadows</p>
<p>In case you want to catch the Spring Meadows, you can still join and win up to $500 this week by competing against fellow players. An additional draw will award an extra $1,000. All of this and more as you stay tuned at Intertops Casino.</p>
