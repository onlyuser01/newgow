<p>Paysafe is convinced that its all-in-one payment will “exceed the transactional expectations” of Fanatics and its fans</p>
<p>Leading payments specialist Paysafe has unveiled a new partnership arrangement with Fanatics Betting and Gaming. Under the deal, the former company will supply the operator with traditional card payments and alternative payment methods (APMs).</p>
<p>Paysafe offers unique API-based solutions through a single, streamlined integration and will provide Fanatics Sportsbook with a number of deposit and withdrawal methods. This will reinforce the operator’s Fanatics Sportsbook, allowing it to meet its customers’ transactional needs.</p>
<p>Thanks to the partnership with Paysafe, Fanatics Sportsbook’s customers in the states of Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio and Tennessee will be able to make seamless deposits into their accounts through the use of debit cards. This will allow them to truly enjoy gaming without needless depositing hassles.</p>
<p>Launches in additional states are expected as Fanatics pursues expansion in the US.</p>
<p>In addition to convenience, Paysafe also provides unparalleled speed when it comes to processing transactions. The Paysafe payment gateway ensures that all transactions are completed in а manner of seconds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, players who prefer dealing in cash can use Paysafe’s barcode-based online cash solution, Paysafecash. A variety of APMs will also be available to players of Fanatics Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, The Mill Adventure expanded its collaboration with Paysafe by providing the latter company’s eCash solutions to its casino partners in Germany.</p>
<p>Representatives Praised the Deal</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the agreement with Zak Cutler, Paysafe’s president of global gaming, welcoming the partnership with the operator. He praised Fanatics as a powerhouse in the world of sports and said that Paysafe is looking forward to backing Fanatics Sportsbook.</p>
<p>With the stature of the Fanatics brand in the sports world, we’re proud to partner with Fanatics Betting and Gaming to provide Fanatics Sportsbook and its customers with an unparalleled payments experience. Zak Cutler, president of global gaming, Paysafe</p>
<p>Cutler said that his team is convinced that its all-in-one payment will “exceed the transactional expectations” of Fanatics and its fans while expanding the brand’s growth in current and future markets.</p>
<p>Kathleen Boord, Fanatics’ senior vice president of strategic operations, also commented on the partnership with Paysafe. She said that her team is excited about the deal and praised Paysafe’s solutions, which provide flexibility through a single integration.</p>
<p>We look forward to the ongoing collaboration with Paysafe as we continue to build on our strong foundation and create the best experience for our Fans. Kathleen Boord, SVP of strategic operations, Fanatics</p>
<p>A month ago, the NY regulator approved Fanatics as the successor of PointsBet’s license in the state.</p>
