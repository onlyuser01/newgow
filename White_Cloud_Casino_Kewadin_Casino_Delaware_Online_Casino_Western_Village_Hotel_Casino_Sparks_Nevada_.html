    <h1>White Cloud Casino Kewadin Casino Delaware Online Casino Western Village Hotel Casino Sparks Nevada</h1>

<p>Hello. I don't know if it's important, but after talking at home, it turned out that I'm not the only one who uses a home computer,</p>
<p>I understand that the casino may verify the counter at any time and possibly block it.</p>
<p>In my case, this happened during the withdrawal. Ggbet informed me about the reason for violating the bonus game rule. He emphasized that after a thorough examination of the account, a violation of the bonus rule was detected --- So why did the system not detect the connection with other accounts, since, as the casino claims, my the activities took place on different accounts with the same IP address. The basis for verification is checking the IP address. At the time of verification, the IP address was not the problem.</p>
<p>Here, in the explanation of the complaint, Ggbet again wrote that after a thorough check of the account, a violation of the bonus rules was found - for the second time, the system did not show links to other accounts.</p>
<p>Only when I effectively explained that, based on my gaming history, the crimes I was accused of could not have occurred, suddenly the casino thoroughly checked the account for the third time. And the system detected many other circumstances, "multi-account", which include various types of cases.</p>
<p>I know that I can't do much because it's hard to prove I'm not guilty, the casino effectively defends itself by proposing such a situation,</p>
<p>And I would like to ask Ggbet once again whether the system indicated and whether, after another thorough check, it turned out that:</p>
<p>--does the casino have proof in the form of, for example, the same game name when collecting skaters and when completing the mission again and receiving the bonus in the form of real funds?</p>
<p>-- does the casino have proof in the form of e.g. the name of the game before the full activation of the bonus or at the time of activation and in the round of collecting the bonus?</p>
<p>-does the casino have proof of additional bonus balances?</p>
<p>Or maybe the casino didn't notice that, for some reason and beyond my control, the game rounds were suspended, but after a short time they were played to the end with the same bonus active?</p>
<p>Maybe the casino should re-examine my account. For the fourth time, exactly?</p>
