    <h1>Gambling Online Casinos California Casino Las Vegas Bet River Casino Sweepstakes Casino Games Da Vin</h1>

<p>I've seen before that I'm not the first to have such a problem, so I'm going to give it a try. I paid 58,000 HUF to the site, and received 58,000 HUF in bonus money. I played, then canceled the bonus, and HUF 258,000 remained. I confirmed my account, verified myself PDF of my paysafe card, utility bill. I asked for a payment, and in response I received that the amounts were deleted from my account because I broke the rules and HUF 58,000 remained. I don't have a problem with that, I understand.</p>
<p>After that I tried to log in, but I couldn't and I received a network error message. I wrote to the customer service, they should delete the cookies as usual, and try logging in from other devices. I tried, it didn't work. Then they wrote that they have the error and that the IT specialists are already working on it. I wanted to request a manual payment, but they didn't reply. This was over a week ago, which is suspicious.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
