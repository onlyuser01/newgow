<p>Hello Matej,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply!</p>
<p>I have checked and player session data from when the player claimed the bonus is no longer available as 3 months passed since. This is only stored for a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>However, we can work with the information we have both confirmed so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your testing has established the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>a) if a player registers using an Ukrainian IP address and correctly selects the country as Ukraine, then no bonuses will be shown available;</p>
<p>b) if the same player then changes his IP address by any means, then no bonuses will be shown available;</p>
<p>c) if a player registers using an IP address from a country where we offer bonuses and selects the country as Ukraine, then bonuses will be shown as available.</p>
<p>The only way in which it would have been possible for liubovL126 to see the bonuses available for her on our website would have been situation c). I can provide evidence to you that she doesn't fall in this case, as the account was registered with an Ukrainian IP - the registration IP is recorded.</p>
<p>This means that the player didn't see any bonuses available on her account to claim.</p>
<ol>
<li>The email you are referring to is the welcome email all players receive upon registration, regardless of the jurisdiction, in an informative note, regarding our welcome package which can also be seen on the website. However, this does not mean that our Terms and Conditions do not apply in such conditions, as the terms are also stated at the bottom of the email. If a player clicks the Click-to-Action-Button they are simply redirected to the deposit page, where, if any, they will see the available bonuses. In our case, if a player from Ukraine would have clicked the button they would have seen no bonuses available in the cashier.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, I would like to re-enforce the fact that in the email received, no codes are provided for any of the promotions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This means that the only way the player could have claimed the bonus is by using a code. Again here I can provide proof that the promotion which was claimed is linked to a code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we don't penalise players from using VPN in normal circumstances, there are a couple of cases where we forbid the use of VPN:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using a VPN to register an account from a prohibited jurisdiction (article 4.3 of the terms and conditions);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using VPN for the sole purpose of creating multiple accounts and/or claiming bonuses and promotions (article 7.33 of the terms and conditions).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I understand this is not an ideal situation and we always try to analyse each decision made from the player's perspective as well.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why in this case our Finance team returned to the player her deposit amount, which the player chose to withdraw from the casino.</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<p>Eugeni√© Lacroix</p>
