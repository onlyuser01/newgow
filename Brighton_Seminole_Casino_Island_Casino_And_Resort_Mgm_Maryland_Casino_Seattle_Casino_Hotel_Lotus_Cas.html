<p>Might of Ra review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Might of Ra is themed around Egyptian mythology, especially the iconic sun god Ra.</p>
<p>Players will begin a journey across the hot sands of the Egyptian desert, a storm rumbling in the distance. As they pass the pyramids, they’ll encounter the majestic god Ra and accept his call to a quest.</p>
<p>This slot is a great find for fans of ancient Egypt and those looking for a magical atmosphere.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Flute notes add a mysterious tone to the soundtrack that will heighten players' sense of adventure. The Middle Eastern feel of the tune also helps establish the Egyptian setting.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with intimidating animals including fierce birds of prey, fiery-eyed horses, black scorpions, and snarling snakes. Each of these creatures has a supernatural quality that upholds the mythical tone of the slot.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, the god Ra looks on, an Ankh symbol hovering in his hand. His elaborate ensemble and ripped abs make his status as a deity clear, however his gentle swaying makes him seem somewhat like a videogame character waiting to be commanded.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, a desert is visible with pyramids in the distance. Though the golden sand is bathed in sunshine, distant grey clouds are illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning. This suggests that even in this dazzling world, conflict is not far off.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Might of Ra create an adventurous Egyptian fantasy.</p>
