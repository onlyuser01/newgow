<p>The company’s sustainability manager, Kajsa Nylander, revealed in a blog post that the proportion of customers showing signs of risky gambling has actually decreased compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel’s Risk Gambling Figures Encouraging but Caution Still Needed</p>
<p>The analysis of gaming patterns conducted by Svenska Spel’s analysts during January and February 2023 showed that customers with risky gambling habits spent less money on their gambling this year compared to the same period in 2022. This trend was particularly clear in online casinos.</p>
<p>While the figures are encouraging, Kajsa Nylander, Svenska Spel’s sustainability manager, called for caution and highlighted the importance of monitoring developments closely:</p>
<p>Our analysis provides a positive picture and shows that several of the measures we have introduced in recent years are working. But it often takes time to develop gambling problems, which is why we have once again increased the focus on our gambling checks. Kajsa Nylander, Svenska Spel</p>
<p>These checks are preventive calls made to new customers who gamble for lower amounts, but where there has been a change in their gambling pattern. The aim is to ensure that customers are gambling for pleasure and for money they can afford to spend. Despite the decrease in risk gambling overall, Nylander emphasized the need to continue having these conversations with customers.</p>
<p>According to Nylander, Svenska Spel is just one of many players in the gaming industry. Therefore, it is not feasible to make sweeping generalizations about risk gambling among the wider population based solely on the company’s data. Nylander emphasized that different gaming companies have distinct responsible gaming measures in place. She stressed the importance of ongoing monitoring to stay up to date with developments in the sector.</p>
<p>Sweden Proposes Deposit Limit and Time Restrictions to Curb Problem Gambling</p>
<p>In December, a new proposal was put forward to tackle problem gambling in Sweden. The proposal suggested that there should be a mandatory deposit limit of SEK5,000 ($595) per week for online casino players. The limit would apply to all players, regardless of their level of risk. In addition, there would be a requirement for players to set a time limit for their gaming sessions.</p>
<p>The Swedish Gambling Authority supported the proposal, stating that it would help to prevent problem gambling. However, some operators were concerned that the proposal would lead to customers playing on unlicensed sites. Despite this, the proposal received a lot of support from politicians and the public, with many believing that it was necessary to tackle the issue of problem gambling. The proposal was set to be reviewed in the coming months to determine its feasibility and effectiveness.</p>
