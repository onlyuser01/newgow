    <h1>Casino Hotel Niagara Falls Ontario Casinos Vegas Ok Casinos Harrah S Casino Nc Chotaw Casino Allwyn</h1>

<p>The incoming National Lottery operator in the United Kingdom has appointed a new chief security officer to strengthen its offering and integrity</p>
<p>Mark Hughes is a long-standing industry veteran, and he will be tasked with all areas of The National Lottery’s security. He will become onboarded with the company’s operations from January 15, 2024, ahead of the official company takeover from Camelot on February 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Bringing Security Veteran to Safeguard Lottery Operations</p>
<p>Hughes is versed in different areas of security, including physical and game platform security, information security, and more. He worked for 16 years at Vodafone and 12 of those he was the company’s head of security for the UK business. Hughes commented on his appointment:</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to be joining Allwyn and being part of the next chapter in the journey of the National Lottery. Working for an organization that literally makes dreams come true and contributes to good causes is a huge privilege and I can’t wait to get started. Mark Hughes</p>
<p>He collaborated closely with the central government and British Intelligence Agencies to ensure that the appropriate safeguards were implemented into Vodafone’s infrastructure, and he is a high-profile hire who brings decades of experience in addressing the various threats a business can face from outside and inside bad actors.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Allwyn UK CEO Adria Vidler welcomed Hughes’ appointment, hailing him as an esteemed of the security community and an individual who has the critical knowledge that will help safeguard the lottery operations at a critical juncture for Allwyn.</p>
<p>“Preserving the security of The National Lottery at all times is of critical importance, including as we roll out our ambitious plans for the transformation of The National Lottery so that it becomes more modern, digital, and engaging for players. I’m delighted to welcome Mark to our team,” Vidler concluded.</p>
<p>An Unease Journey to the Final Goal</p>
<p>Allwyn is preparing to take control of The National Lottery from Camelot, which was the undisputed incumbent, with the former company securing a win in a public tender and changing the status quo for the very first since the lottery had launched.</p>
<p>This caused an outcry on the part of Camelot, which launched multiple legal challenges on its part to the public tender conducted by the UK Gambling Commission, but ultimately settled with Allwyn and decided to sell its operations in the country, ensuring a smooth transition in the process.</p>
<p>However, a new challenge to Allwyn’s winning bid has been issued by Richard Diamond, a British businessman and media mogul.</p>
