<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I understand what you say, but when it comes to complaints the safety index decreases based on the number of black points earned through that - in your case 400. This is quite a low value.</p>
<p>Quoting from the complaint guide:</p>
<p>"If the complaint is justified and we are unable to resolve it, it is closed and categorized as being 'unresolved'. This happens when the casino either does not respond to us or refuses to do what we consider to be fair in that specific situation. You will not get your desired outcome but the complaint will be saved in our system, the casino will be punished with a lower rating from us and our review of the casino will warn other players of what happened. What's more, if the casino wants to improve its rating in the future, it will be forced to address the complaint, so there is a chance that your complaint will be resolved at a later date."</p>
<p>The warning is there, though, not just only in the form of the unresolved complaint, but also as a part of the overview: ﻿﻿</p>
<p>If you scroll down, you'll see the latest complaint right over the Safety Index, so those won't be missed.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the system is perfect as it is, on the other hand, it is the way we do it now. We need math and values to punish casinos exactly the same way to maintain fairness.</p>
<p>I honor your opinion; take this as a short summary of the very complex process.</p>
