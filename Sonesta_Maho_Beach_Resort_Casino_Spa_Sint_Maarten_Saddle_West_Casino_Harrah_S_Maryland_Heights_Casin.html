<p>The fast-growing business-to-business (B2B) game provider and aggregation platform within the iGaming vertical, REEVO, announced a new deal, expanding further its offering. Earlier this week, the B2B game provider revealed that it forged a partnership with the developer of next-generation slots, Mancala Gaming.</p>
<p>The new deal represents an important achievement for Mancala Gaming as it will enable the provider's content to reach new audiences. Per the freshly minted deal, the developer of games will integrate its diverse range of portfolio into REEVO's aggregation platform. This will enable Mancala Gaming's titles to engage with new customers around the globe thanks to REEVO's network of partners.</p>
<p>The partnership doesn't come as a surprise, considering the popularity of Mancala Gaming's content. As an up-and-coming developer of games for the online gambling vertical, the company creates titles that cater to millennials, as well as Generation Y audiences. Implementing fresh themes and innovative features enables the company's games to capture the attention of those audiences. Constantly growing its portfolio of offering, Mancala Gaming confirmed that this summer, it will introduce unique experiences via its highly-anticipated Crash Games.</p>
<p>Emiliano Sanchez, Mancala Gaming's Chief Commercial Officer, shared his excitement about the latest deal in a statement saying: "I'm thrilled to share that we've partnered with REEVO, a top game aggregator." He explained that this deal complements the company's ongoing commitment to reach new audiences around the globe.</p>
<p>Sanchez explained: "REEVO's expertise and commitment to excellence align perfectly with our values, and we're excited to collaborate with them to deliver an unparalleled gaming experience." Finally, he acknowledged that the collaboration with REEVO represents an important milestone for the company which is also looking forward to the success the future will bring.</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO's Head of Sales, was also delighted about the latest partnership with Mancala Gaming. She said: "Mancala produces some really exciting games that I'm confident our extensive network of operator partners will immediately want to offer their players across a wide range of countries." Finally, Poola pointed out: "It's great to have them on board."</p>
<p>Besides expanding its portfolio of partners, REEVO constantly grows its own portfolio. Teaming up with new partners enables the company's aggregation platform to expand its offering, making it more attractive to operators around the world. At the same time, those B2B partnerships enable up-and-coming studios to expand the reach of their products to new customers. Currently, REEVO's platform offers more than 8000 games from 70 leading iGaming content providers.</p>
