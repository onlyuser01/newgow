    <h1>Mgm Casino Northfield Fantasy Casino Bay 101 Casino Fun Club Casino 300 No Deposit Bonus Rollbit Cas</h1>

<p>The US-facing deal follows the parties’ successful collaboration in the European market</p>
<p>Pariplay, a subsidiary of the leading B2B provider NeoGames, has teamed up with Tipico’s US arm. Under the deal, the gambling operator will onboard some of Pariplay’s best games, expanding the provider’s presence in North America.</p>
<p>As agreed, Pariplay will leverage its proprietary studio, Wizard Games, as well as its aggregation platform, Fusion, to inject a variety of titles into Tipico US’s offering in New Jersey. As a result, players in the state will get to experience some of the best games the NeoGames subsidiary has to offer.</p>
<p>Tipico already partners with Pariplay in Europe, offering its games to local audiences. The addition of the supplier’s content into the operator’s online casino in New Jersey reinforces the companies’ existing partnership, allowing them to strengthen their businesses in North America.</p>
<p>According to the two parties’ official announcement, Pariplay’s content is set to be integrated into Tipico’s platform in the Garden State in the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>The partnership with Tipico follows a similar deal that Pariplay inked with RSI a month ago. In August, Wizard Games also delivered content to the Atlantic Lottery in Canada.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Take Pariplay and Tipico to New Heights</p>
<p>NeoGames’ president and head of iGaming, Tsachi Maimon, expressed his thoughts on the new deal, saying that his team is looking forward to supplying a “wealth of fantastic content” to Tipico US and reinforcing its recently updated online casino in NJ.</p>
<p>Following our successful collaboration in the European market, we can’t wait to bring our Wizard Games and Fusion offerings to even more players in North America, a key region for us. Tsachi Maimon, president &amp; head of iGaming, NeoGames</p>
<p>Maimon concluded that his team’s experience with regulated states has been very good so far. Because of that, he is certain that the deal with Tipico will “take Pariplay to new heights.”</p>
<p>Adrian Vella, Tipico US’ chief executive officer, also commented on the matter, reflecting Maimon’s optimism about the deal.</p>
<p>As we celebrate the launch of our new and improved, industry-leading online casino platform in New Jersey, we’re ecstatic to be able to offer Pariplay’s market-leading content to our player base in the new year. Adrian Vella, CEO, Tipico US</p>
<p>Vella added that the Wizard Games portfolio and the expansive Fusion offering will be a great addition to Tipico’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Prior to the current partnership, Tipico also onboarded games from Wazdan, another leading gambling content provider.</p>
