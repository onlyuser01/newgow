    <h1>Emerald Queen Casino Hotels Ms Casinos Casino Game Sunscape Cura ao Resort Spa Casino Miami Casino C</h1>

<p>The new game sports a host of innovative mechanics to keep players engaged</p>
<p>Nailed It! Games, an independent gaming studio based in Krakow, is set to release a new cat-themed slot called CatPurry. The new title will launch on the Games Global Platform on August 7, allowing iGaming operators to engage their players with exciting feline-themed fun.</p>
<p>CatPurry Metrics</p>

<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Paylines: 20</p>
<p>Volatility: Medium</p>
<p>RTP: 96.0% / 94.0% / 92.0% / 86.80%</p>
<p>Hit Frequency: 37%</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0.10/20</p>
<p>Max Win: 15,000x</p>
<p>Collect Candy and Paw-Stamped Coins</p>
<p>During a game of CatPurry, players will collect various candy symbols to win prizes.</p>
<p>CatPurry sports a variety of innovative mechanics, such as a special stacked Cat symbol that can land on the middle reel. The special cat covers the reel completely, adding between three and nine Scatter Coins.</p>
<p>Speaking of Scatter Coins, landing on three of them grants an Epic Strike instant cash prize to players. Landing on four or more activates Sticky Respin – a mechanic that keeps all coins in place while respinning all other symbols.</p>
<p>Finally, if players manage to land 15 Scatter Coins, they will trigger the Sweet 15 bonus. At that moment, each coin will unwrap to reveal either a chocolate or a diamond. Chocolates award no prize but each diamond will add a multiplier of 1,000x to a maximum of 15,000x.</p>
<p>Free Spins Mode Maximizes the Win Potential</p>
<p>Finally, the new game also features а Free Spins bonus round where players can win huge prizes. The mode is triggered when players land on three or more Free Spins symbols. Landing on three symbols award 10 spins, while four and five symbols award 14 and 20 spins respectively.</p>
<p>In addition, getting two or more such symbols during the bonus game will award extra spins. Two symbols award 3 additional spins, three symbols award 5 spins, four symbols award 7 spins and five symbols extend the game by 10 more spins.</p>
<p>The bonus game begins with 5 stacked cat symbol. Each spin adds an additional symbol on the cat stack and elongates the cat, making it easier to activate the coin bonus.</p>
<p>The new game’s upcoming release was hailed by Paweł Piotrowski, Nailed It! Games’ co-founder. He praised his team for developing a game with many exciting features and bonuses to discover. Piotrowski underscored the game’s massive win potential, hoping that it will attract many players.</p>
<p>We always push ourselves when it comes to slot creation, and we are keen to see the reception to mechanics such as the Cat Stack and the Sweet 15 round. We can’t wait to see what players think of this one! Paweł Piotrowski, co-founder, Nailed It! Games</p>
<p>Last month, Nailed It! Games welcomed Mauro Dos Santos as its new business development manager.</p>
