<p>This is notably FanDuel’s third donation to the UNCF in three years and follows similar donations in Virginia and Maryland</p>
<p>FanDuel, a North American online gambling powerhouse, unveiled a $1 million donation supporting the United Negro College Fund (UNCF). The money, according to the announcement, will help the latter organization build a robust and nationally recognized pipeline for under-represented students.</p>
<p>UNCF is the nation’s largest and most effective minority education organization and helps young people from under-represented communities become highly qualified college graduates. The organization will use FanDuel’s money to provide financial support to students at 10 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) across Ohio.</p>
<p>This is notably FanDuel’s third donation to the UNCF in three years. Previously, the gambling company provided similar donations to support UNCF’s initiatives in Virginia and Maryland.</p>
<p>The donation will see the organization provide direct aid to help students in a variety of areas. This will notably include technology, housing, food security, tuition and other education-related expenses, the announcement says. In addition, FanDuel will work with the philanthropic organization to recruit students from the schools to join its internship program.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, FanDuel’s decision to support UNCF’s efforts in Ohio celebrates the one-year anniversary of the launch of mobile sports betting in The Buckeye State.</p>
<p>For reference, the 10 colleges that will benefit from the donations include the following:</p>
<p>Case Western University</p>
<p>Central State University</p>
<p>Chamberlain University</p>
<p>Franklin University</p>
<p>Herzing University-Akron</p>
<p>Ohio State University-Newark Campus</p>
<p>Union Institute &amp; University</p>
<p>Ursuline College</p>
<p>Wilberforce University</p>
<p>University of Cincinnati-Blue Ash College</p>
<p>UNCF Thanked FanDuel for Its Support</p>
<p>Maurice E. Jenkins, UNCF’s executive vice president and chief fundraising officer, praised FanDuel’s ongoing support, saying that his team truly appreciates the gambling company’s backing. He added that financial and academic support like this is what makes a real difference for HBCUs and their students.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing our partnership; students benefit so much from internship opportunities. Maurice E. Jenkins, EVP &amp; CFO, UNCF</p>
<p>FanDuel’s president, Christian Genetski, also commented on the matter, saying that his team continues to strive to make a positive impact in the communities in which the company operates.</p>
<p>As we reflect on our first year of operation in Ohio, we’re proud to continue our partnership with UNCF to support the HBCU community in the state and look forward to supporting hard-working students at institutions across Ohio. Christian Genetski, president, FanDuel</p>
