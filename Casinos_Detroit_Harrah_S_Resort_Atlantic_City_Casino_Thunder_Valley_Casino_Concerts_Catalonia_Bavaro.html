<p>The new strategic agreement is expected to fuel the growth of the two companies</p>
<p>The provider of innovative and scalable solutions for the online gambling industry, Light &amp; Wonder, announced that it signed a new global distribution agreement with Betsson Group, the market-leading and globally recognized operator. The new collaboration, deemed as strategic, grants unique opportunities for the two companies that have collaborated before and enjoyed significant success.</p>
<p>Per the new agreement, Light &amp; Wonder’s extensive OpenGaming platform will be able to reach new markets via Betsson. While this partnership will significantly expand the reach of the company’s platform, it is also expected to fuel Betsson’s growth within existing, as well as new markets around the globe. Additionally, the betting and gaming company will benefit from new games, boosting the content available to its customers.</p>
<p>Currently, Betsson has a strong presence within different strategic markets across Europe, as well as Latin America. While the company previously enjoyed success thanks to its partnership with Light &amp; Wonder, now, it anticipates further growth and expansion.</p>
<p>“Light &amp; Wonder has been our trusted supplier since the early days of our journey within iGaming. We followed a similar path of market entries when the landscape was shifting, and they have always been there for us.“ Laura Peretta, head of supplier relations at Betsson Group</p>
<p>Laura Peretta, Betsson Group’s head of supplier relations, explained that Light &amp; Wonder was a trusted partner of the company ever since its expansion within the online gambling vertical. Speaking about the OpenGaming technology, she said that it “guarantees expertise, scalability, and exceptional content delivery.” Finally, Peretta said that Betsson is looking forward to the benefits the new deal will bring for the two companies.</p>
<p>Betsson Is Excited to Continue Collaborating with Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>The deal with Betsson represents an important achievement for Light &amp; Wonder as it boosts the position of the company’s OpenGaming platform within the iGaming vertical. The platform is known to deliver more than 3,500 games from third-party and in-house game developers, supercharging the offering of operators around the globe. At the same time, the solution stands out with security and seamless integration. OpenGaming also offers responsible gambling tools.</p>
<p>“We view Betsson Group as an important operator that has shown commitment and trust to Light &amp; Wonder over many years.“ Magdalena Podhorska-Okolow, MD Europe at Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Magdalena Podhorska-Okolow, Light &amp; Wonder’s MD Europe, explained that the company sees a good partner in the face of Betsson Group. She pointed out that the two companies have successfully collaborated for years and fueled each other’s growth. Finally, Podhorska-Okolow said that Light &amp; Wonder is looking forward to helping Betsson continue to grow. The new partnership comes on the heels of another deal by the company with Shift4, a leading provider of integrated payments and solutions.</p>
