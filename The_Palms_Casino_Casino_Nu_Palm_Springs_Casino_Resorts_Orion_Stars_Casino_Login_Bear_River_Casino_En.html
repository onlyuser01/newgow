<p>Entain CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen Resigns Amid ‘Internal Unrest’ Rumors</p>

<p>The Danish executive’s resignation came amid disgruntled noises from activist investors, many of whom are dissatisfied with the company’s recent performance and who have questioned a series of misfiring acquisitions and missed opportunities.</p>
<p>It also comes just weeks after Entain agreed to pay a £585 million (US$729 million) penalty to HMRC, the UK tax authority. That was to settle historic bribery accusations related to the company’s former black-market Turkish operations.</p>
<p>The past three years have been rewarding and challenging in equal measure,” Nygaard-Andersen said in a statement Wednesday morning. “The resolution of the HMRC investigation into the legacy business, which was sold by a former management team in 2017, offers a clean inflection point for me and for Entain.</p>
<p>“The group is now safe, stable, and sustainable, and I believe that this is the right time to move on to other business and career opportunities,” she added.</p>
<p>Share Slump</p>
<p>Nygaard-Andersen landed the role in January 2021, shortly after Entain rejected a takeover bid by MGM Resorts International, with whom it jointly owns BetMGM in the U.S.</p>
<p>The $8.1 billion MGM proposal valued the company at £13.83 a share. On Wednesday afternoon, it was worth just £8.43, and that’s after climbing 5% on the news of Nygaard-Andersen’s resignation. In October 2021, a takeover bid by DraftKings also fell through.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, The Financial Times has reported “internal unrest” at Entain over Nygaard-Andersen’s management of the company, which has been one of the poorest recent performers for shareholder returns on the FTSE 100.</p>
<p>The company has spent $2 billion on largely regional-market acquisitions under her tenure, many of which have performed badly. Meanwhile, its U.S. operations with MGM have failed to loosen DraftKings’ and FanDuel’s stranglehold on the market.</p>
<p>‘Private Jette’</p>
<p>Corporate costs have almost doubled, and there have been raised eyebrows about Nygaard-Andersen’s penchant for travel by private jet, according to the FT. This has led to some Entain staffers nicknaming her “Private Jette,” insiders report.</p>
<p>Entain has asked Stella David, a nonexecutive director, to stand in as CEO on an interim basis until a permanent replacement for Nygaard-Andersen is found.</p>
<p>Under Jette’s leadership, Entain has executed a fundamental strategic shift towards regulated or regulating markets, overhauled its governance, transformed its operations, and significantly improved its customer offering,” Entain chair Barry Gibson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Gibson praised Nygaard-Andersen’s “exceptional leadership” during a “hugely challenging period.”</p>
