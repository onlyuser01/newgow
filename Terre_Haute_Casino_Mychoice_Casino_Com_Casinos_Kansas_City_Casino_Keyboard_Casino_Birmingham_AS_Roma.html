    <h1>Terre Haute Casino Mychoice Casino Com Casinos Kansas City Casino Keyboard Casino Birmingham AS Roma</h1>

<p>One of Italy’s topflight soccer teams will now work with the Asian-focused sportsbook to raise awareness for its brand across targeted markets</p>
<p>AS Roma, the Italian soccer ace, has formed an alliance with sports wagering company 678.com, and has selected the operator as the club’s Asian Online Betting Partner.</p>
<p>678 to Raise Its Profile Through AS Roma Partnership</p>
<p>678 has been hailed as one of the best online entertainment platforms, AS Roma noted in a press statement, adding that the platform offered fans an innovative and technology-driven experience, enabling them to enjoy gambling products in the safest and healthiest possible way.</p>
<p>Jason Fong, brand manager at 678.com, was excited about the opportunity to see this partnership form and said:</p>
<p>This partnership means a great deal to both brands and brings together AS Roma’s passionate fans with the many users of 678.com. Jason Fong, brand manager at 678.com</p>
<p>Fong was particularly happy with the club’s history and stature in top-flight soccer around the world, and Asia in particular, which would undoubtedly lead to a boost in 678’s own reputation as the company pursues further growth opportunities in Asia.</p>
<p>The partnership will be mostly visible on Asian channels, along with virtual pitchside LED hoardings during Roma’s Serie A games, and social media promotions designed to drive activations and enliven the fan experience.</p>
<p>Partnerships between betting clubs and topflight soccer clubs have been the talk of the town of late, with most regulators beginning to expect clubs to voluntarily drop such deals. Mounting public pressure has made sports teams all over the world drop their partnerships, but for clubs – there is always a good way to monetize their assets.</p>
<p>The Public Has a Say in What It Sees</p>
<p>Although they may not be allowed to advertise gambling companies at home, some clubs have been able to strike overseas deals and only advertise in specific regions around the world. Sports betting companies offer some exceptional financial incentives to operators as well – a statement that has come under a lot of critique.</p>
<p>Societal pressure does matter, as a recent arrangement between Chelsea, a Premier League club, and Stake, a renowned global operator, failed short of materializing after backlash from fans.</p>
