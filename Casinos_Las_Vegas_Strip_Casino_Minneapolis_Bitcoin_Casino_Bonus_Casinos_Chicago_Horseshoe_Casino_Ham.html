<p>Whoever wins this game will advance to the next stage of the Champions League. It’s because the first leg of the Round of 16 doubleheader between Man City and Leipzig ended in a 1-1 tie. Oddsmakers think it’s going to be Pep Guardiola’s team, one of the reasons being that the game is played in England.</p>

<p>Man City’s Road to UCL Title Doesn’t Look That Rough</p>
<p>The only thing that’s still missing from Man City’s trophy cabinet is the Champions League trophy. However, oddsmakers believe they’re going to get ahold of it in 2023. The Sky Blues from Manchester are the No. 1 favorite to win the title, with the betting odds of +200.</p>
<p>Among the reasons why that is the case is that many other heavyweights have already been knocked out of the competition (e.g., PSG), while some are gonna get knocked out soon (e.g., Liverpool who are 6-2 down on aggregate against Real Madrid).</p>
<p>Another reason why Man City are favored to win the UCL in 2023 is that this team has a fantastic roster. They’re superb in every aspect of the game, but especially the attack, where they got Erling Haaland, who’s seen as the No. 1 favorite to become the UCL scoring leader at +125. He currently has five goals to his name, three fewer than the current leader, Liverpool’s Mo Salah.</p>
<p>RB Leipzig Need a Miracle on Tuesday</p>
<p>No one’s beaten Manchester City in the Champions League at Etihad Stadium since September 2018. Can RB Leipzig change that? If they want to advance to the next phase of the competition, they need to win on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Whether it’s going to be a win in 90 minutes, after extra time, or after penalties, it doesn’t matter. It’s because their first duel finished 1-1. Speaking of which, RB Leipzig need to feel lucky for getting a draw on their turf three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Man City players dominated that game with two times more goal attempts and two times longer ball possession. RB Leipzig weren’t impressive at home and one can only assume they won’t do much better on the road.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs RB Leipzig Prediction</p>
<p>Anything but a home win would be a huge shocker. The Cityzens are superior to their German foes in every single aspect. Plus, they play on their turf, where they’re always dominant. That said, not only will they win, but they’ll do it in style, putting away at least two or three goals.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
