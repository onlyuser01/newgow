    <h1>Online Casino Gaming Downtown Grand Hotel Casino Rivers Casino Des Plaines Illinois Red Rock Casino</h1>

<p>I have been playing at getwin.com for over 2 years and have had an issue with the speed that my withdrawals have occurred but never to this degree of total ghosting.</p>
<p>I will not go word for for word in my summary if the issue as I have and am happy to provide all communications.</p>
<p>Requested a withdrawal for 4500.00 on 08/26/2022. Surprisingly, received a very prompt reply that said there was a spike in RTP for that game provider and they would have to wait for the games provider data to be returned. Promised within 48 hours . Also allowed me to cancel and request 4000.00 and 500.00 respectively so that they could immediately process 500.00 for me . They did that . And then I waited and again surprisingly they replied in a prompt and positive manner. Corey was the representative throughout .</p>
<p>I was informed more than once that my withdrawal would be processed "that day" or "within hours" and then nothing .</p>
<p>I'm an effort to be transparent I will say about 7 days in I wasn't getting anywhere and decided to cancel. I had an issue with my bitcoin wallet in regards to a different and completely separate transaction so ibwanted tonchange my wallet address for deposit ( and play a little ), and resubmit my withdrawal request . Which i did within an hour of the cancellation if the original reuqest . Corey communicated in an email that this was acceptable. I ended up requesting 3500.00 which is the current amount I am waiting for and I haven't had a response from the getwin support team in over 6 days the last communication they responded to was on the 6th .</p>
<p>I haven't ever been verbally abusive or rude . I haven't shamed on social media . I haven't behaved in anyway other than courteous and professional and I haven't broken any of their T&amp;C's that I can determine and I have read them .</p>
<p>I also have offered to provide any KYC they might need.</p>
<p>Can you please help me get my money?</p>
<p>As I said I do have every screenshot and email correspondence and will send if requested to do so .</p>
<p>Thank you .</p>
